Fifteen and 13 patients had infections caused by a single and multiple organism, respectively (Tables 3 and 4). CMV was the most common established virus, as it was identified simultaneously in plasma and BALF samples from 5 patients, with median plasma and BALF viral loads of 1.71 (1.09\u20132.70) \u00d7 103/copies and 2.41 (0.43\u201394.9) \u00d7 103/copies, respectively. The second most common virus was EBV, which was identified simultaneously in plasma and BALF samples from 2 patients, with median plasma and BALF viral loads of 1.90 (1.30\u20132.49) \u00d7 103/copies and 32.08 (0.85\u201363.30) \u00d7 103/copies, respectively. The third most common virus was RSV, which was identified simultaneously in plasma and BALF samples from 1 patient. The most common bacterium was Acinetobacter baumannii, followed by P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecium. Several multiresistant bacteria were recovered (A. baumannii, n = 4; P. aeruginosa: n = 1; E. faecium: n = 1). Candida was identified in the BALF of 2 patients, which might suggest a bystander organism (Table 4). In the NI\u2010LOSP group, 15, 5, and 2 patients could be classified as having idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), organizing pneumonia, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, respectively. The mechanical ventilation rate was higher and the median mechanical ventilation duration was longer in the I\u2010LOSP group (Table 2). The 100\u2010day survival rate of the I\u2010LOSP group was significantly lower than that of the NI\u2010LOSP group (19.1% vs. 46.9%, P = 0.043, Fig. 2).",

Chen et al. 3 also observed that infection was an important cause of late\u2010onset pneumonia after allo\u2010HSCT. In addition, pathogens were not detected in 22 patients and most of them might thus meet the diagnostic criteria for IPS 18, suggesting that alloimmune reactions play an important role in the development of LOSP 19. However, Seo et al. 20 reported that more than half of the patients previously diagnosed with IPS were found to harbor pathogens according to currently available diagnostic methods, which suggests that infection remains the most important cause of LOSP. In addition, most infectious agents can trigger autoimmunity via different mechanisms 21, and many studies have observed that infections, particularly the viral infections, can trigger a graft\u2010versus\u2010host (GVH) reaction 22, 23, 24. Therefore, we suggest that the immune reactions in patients with NI\u2010LOSP might also have occult infectious etiologies. Although some pathogens detected in BALF likely represent the shedding of pulmonary pathogens rather than invasive disease 25, we observed higher CMV and EBV loads in BALF than in plasma. Patients with LOSP might be too ill to undergo further invasive examinations (e.g., biopsy for histological confirmation). In addition, Seo et al. 20 observed that IPS patients with detectable pathogens had a significantly worse 100\u2010day OS rate, compared to patients without pathogens, which was in accordance with our results. Therefore, the correct method of identifying pathogens from blood and/or BALF might be critical to improving the outcomes of patients with LOSP.",

We also observed that the median value of oxygenation index was <200, and as high as 62% (31/50) of the LOSP patients need mechanical ventilation. It is suggested that LOSP progresses rapidly and acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in most of the patients. Therefore, our strategy of empirical broad\u2010spectrum antimicrobial therapy administration was reasonable. In addition, we observed that the initial corticosteroid therapy dosage and timing were associated with the outcomes of patients with LOSP; notably, early and high\u2010dose MP therapy did not improve the outcomes. The hypothesized benefit gained from corticosteroid administration for severe pneumonia might be due to reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, downregulated leukocyte adhesion protein expression, and the prevention of excessive alveolar collagen deposition 26. However, infection may be an important cause of LOSP, and high\u2010dose MP did not help to eliminate the pathogens; additionally secondary infections might associate with high\u2010dose MP therapy. Many studies found that low\u2010dose corticosteroid therapy may improve the outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia 27, 28. In a systematic review by Lamontagne et al. 29, treatment with a corticosteroid dosage equivalent to \u22642 mg/kg/day of MP was associated with lower hospital mortality in patients with severe pneumonia, and Tang et al. 30 found that an MP dosage of 0.5\u20132.5 mg/kg/day or the equivalent was associated with improved mortality and morbidity outcomes without increased adverse reactions in patients with severe pneumonia. We observed better survival rates among patients with LOSP treated with low\u2010dose MP (\u22642 mg/kg/day). In addition, as mentioned above, immune reactions, which might also have occult infectious etiologies, could play an important role in the development of LOSP. Although Meduri et al. 28 observed that MP used in early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with significant improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, we observed that patients receiving MP therapy within 1 week after LOSP diagnosis had poor outcomes. We speculate that early MP therapy might lead to a loss of infection control and may thus worsen the situation. In cases of LOSP after allo\u2010HSCT, wherein pathogens were cleared using effective anti\u2010infection treatments but infection\u2010related immune reactions remained, corticosteroid therapy could improve patient outcomes. Thus, this is an important finding and underscores that corticosteroid therapy should not be used in all patients with LOSP after allo\u2010HSCT.",

Liu et al. 4 observed that among 6 patients with LOSP who received DLI, 3 survived until the end of follow\u2010up. However, in our study, DLI did not improve the outcomes of patients with LOSP.

Similarly, Schwartz et al. 31 showed that the male gender was associated with diminished survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This might be a result of the higher frequency of smokers among male patients (i.e., all smokers in this study were male), as smoking before HSCT was an independent risk factor for worse survival in our multivariate analysis. In addition, patients with a higher BALF neutrophil percentage had a worse OS. Several studies observed that a higher BALF neutrophil percentage was associated with a poor outcome in both infectious and non\u2010infectious lung injury patients 32, 33, 34. It has therefore been suggested that overzealous neutrophil activation might result in severe alveolar damage resulting from the release of cytotoxic and immune cell\u2010activating agents 35.",

Third, we could not detect the loads of viruses except for CMV and EBV, and therefore, we could not further identify the association between the virus load and the outcomes of LOSP. Finally, the large number of different treatments administered to treat patients in both the I\u2010LOSP and NI\u2010LOSP groups introduced heterogeneity to our justification of the generic conclusion regarding the advantage given by late and low\u2010dose MP therapy with respect to the clinical outcomes of patients with LOSP.
