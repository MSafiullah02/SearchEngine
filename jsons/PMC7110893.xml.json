            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as a novel coronavirus that caused a viral outbreak in 2003. It spread from Guangdong province in China to about 28 countries around the world and caused 774 deaths in 8096 infected individuals [1], [2], [3]. SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome size of 29.7 kb, and belongs to group 2b within the Coronaviridae family [4]. The genome of SARS-CoV encodes for the replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and four structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), that are common to all coronaviruses as well as eight unique accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9b) [5], [6], [7]. Among these accessory proteins, 3a, 6 and 7a were shown to be virion-associated [8], [9], [10], [11] while 6, 7b and 8a were demonstrated to be able to modulate virus replication [12], [13], [14]. For other coronaviruses, the accessory proteins have been shown to contribute to viral virulence and pathogenesis even though they are not essential for coronavirus replication in cultured cells [15], [16].",

It is postulated that this deletion within the ORF8 region of the SARS-CoV genome may be an evolutionary adaptation to the human host [19], [20], [21]. The 29-nucleotide deletion results in the splitting of a single ORF8ab into two overlapping ORFs, ORF8a and ORF8b. The ORF8ab region encodes for a single protein 8ab of 122 amino acids while ORF8a and ORF8b encode for proteins 8a and 8b of 39 and 84 amino acids, respectively [19].",

            "text": "Recent evidence shows that 8ab, which can be glycosylated, is a functional ER-resident protein, behaves like an integral membrane protein and modulates the unfolded protein response pathway by specifically activating ATF6 [22], [23], [24]. 8a was reported to promote viral replication and induce apoptosis while 8b was shown to induce DNA synthesis [13], [25]. We have also previously characterized the cellular properties of the 8a, 8b and 8ab proteins and found that 8b down-regulates the SARS-CoV E protein through a post-translational pathway [26]. Further studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors can inhibit both the degradation of 8b and 8b-mediated down-regulation of E [22]. In addition, 8b and 8ab were shown to be able to bind covalently and non-covalently to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin. Ubiquitin is a 76 amino-acid protein that plays a role in the regulation of protein interactions and protein sorting pathways [27]. Many viruses have evolved to hijack the host ubiquitin-proteasome machinery to regulate their own viral protein levels [28]. Ubiquitin conjugation to target protein consists of three distinct enzymatic steps [28], [29], [30]. First, an activating enzyme (E1) binds ubiquitin through a thioester bond, using ATP in the process. Next, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) takes over the activated ubiquitin through a thioester linkage and finally, the transfer of the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein is catalyzed by an E3 ligase.",

The host ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a commonly exploited pathway by viruses for their own protein level regulation [28] and the role of an E3 ligase is to catalyze the transfer of an activated ubiquitin from an E2 to the lysine residue of the target protein [27], [28], [29], [30]. To explore the possibility of 8b acting as an E3 ligase, a lysine knockout mutant of 8b, 8b(K4,26,81R), was generated by substituting the three lysine residues in 8b with arginine residues. As shown in Fig. 1\nA, both 8b and 8b(K4,26,81R) underwent monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). The monoubiquitinated product of 8b-myc was detected at \u223c17 kDa while the polyubiquitinated products of 8b-myc appeared as a ladder. However, the monoubiquitinated 8b was somewhat reduced in the lysine knockout mutant (Fig. 1A, lane 7). Thus, a novel mechanism might be involved in the polyubiquitination of 8b while the lysine residues contribute partially to the monoubiquitination of 8b.",

The results showed that the K54R substitution does not affect the polyubiquitination of E(K54R) (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3) but K64R substitution reduces the polyubiquitination of E(K64R) and E(K54,64R) (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 5). Hence, the increase in the stabilities of E(K64R) and E(K54,64R) is correlated with a decrease in their polyubiquitination.",

To address this discrepancy, the expressions of S and 8b in Vero E6 cells were analyzed at different time-points post infection (Fig. 4\n). The results showed that S was expressed early during infection and could be detected in almost all the cells at 8 hpi (Fig. 4, M\u2013P).

From genomic studies, it is predicted that the reservoirs of SARS-CoV are the bats, with the palm civet acting as the amplification media before spilling the virus over to the human population [35], [36], [37]. When a RNA virus switches from host-to-host, genomic changes take place due to the high error rate of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and absence of a proof-reading mechanism, thus allowing for the evolution of new strains and selection of the fittest strains [38]. During human-to-human transmission in the middle phase of the epidemic, the ORF8 region of the SARS-CoV acquired a 29-nucleotide deletion, resulting in the removal of the 8ab protein while acquiring new proteins, 8a and 8b [19]. Whether this genomic change is a result of the instability of the genome or the acquisition of new functions for host adaptation remains to be addressed.",

It is widely known that lysine residues are important for the binding of ubiquitin to a protein for ubiquitination [27]. In this study, the results showed that the lysine residues in 8b are not required for its polyubiquitination or ability to down-regulate E (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the degradation of E by 8b is dependent on both K54 and K64 in E while the half-life and polyubiquitination of E in the absence of 8b is only dependent on K64 (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Thus, the 8b-mediated degradation of E, which can be inhibited by proteasome inhibitors [22], seems to involve an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway. Several ubiquitin-independent proteolytic functions of the proteasome have been reported [39]. Although many of the ubiquitin-independent pathways have yet to be precisely defined, a recent study showed that more than 20% of cellular proteins are degraded by the proteasome via ubiquitin-independent pathways [40].",

A time-course study revealed that 8b was expressed at late time-points post infection (\u223c32 hpi) (Fig. 4). By comparing Vero E6 cells stably expressing GFP-8b or GFP alone, progeny virus production was found to be significantly reduced in the presence of ectopic expression of 8b (Fig. 5). Moreover, the expression of E in SARS-CoV infected cells was down-regulated in cells stably expressing GFP-8b when compared to GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 6). This is consistent with our previous observation that infected cells with high level of 8b have low level of E [26] and suggests that 8b reduces viral replication by down-regulating the expression of E protein.",

            "text": "Taken together, our results suggest that the overexpression of the SARS-CoV 8b protein reduces viral replication by down-regulating E via an ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway. In virus evolution, rapid mutation is constantly taking place to achieve a strain which can have optimal replication titer for both efficient transmission and the ability to evade the host immune response [43], [44]. Based on the results obtained using Vero E6 overexpressing 8b, we speculate that the ability of 8b to reduce viral replication could be a mechanism to prevent the over-production of virus after reaching an optimal viral titer. However, future studies need to be performed to determine if 8b can modulate viral replication during natural infection. Interestingly, another SARS-CoV accessory protein, 7b, was recently shown to be an attenuating factor [12]. One unanswered question is whether the replication of a SARS-CoV without 8b in the natural host will be higher than that of the wild-type virus. Previous studies have shown the deletion of 8b and several other accessory proteins, namely 6, 7a, 7b, 8a and 9b, from the SARS-CoV genome reduced viral replication in cell cultures by 5\u201310-fold [41], [42]. Thus, it is possible that the weak down-regulation of viral replication by 8b can be counter-balanced by other accessory proteins. For example, Chen et al. have shown that 8a protein can increase viral replication [13]. Thus, the SARS-CoV could have acquired the 8a and 8b proteins to fine-tune its replication in the human host.",
