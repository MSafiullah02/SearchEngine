First, as human beings, we tend to commit the same mistakes over and over again. For every real problem that we see threatening our neighbour, we act as if this problem was not going to affect us. It is the ancestral magical thinking (I am different) that accompanies us from our beginnings. And, even though we consider the problem might become ours, we believe that we are better prepared to successfully face such a threat (or in other words, that the neighbour is not as well prepared as we are). In any case, we miss the possibility of taking advantage of previous experiences, and this is especially fatal when immediate response is needed. And in the end, a mixture of arrogance, self-confidence and stupidity bites us.",

Some strategies aimed at by this proposal have been put forward, ranging from the most aggressive (all citizens confined at home, no working activity allowed beyond that which is essential) to the most conservative (no general confinement, just the population at highest risk -elders and chronically sick people -and let's allow the rest of the people to get infected and create immunity as soon as possible). Midway, there is a range of strategies which, in addition to health targets, have been somewhat influenced by economic issues. All of these have been considered with the belief that the population will follow the instructions of the leaders (again, magical thinking).",

But this is simply impossible in this scenario, and we have to move according to inductive thinking to decide which strategy is perceived as best in every moment. The expert efforts in decision making with loads of uncertainty has been laudable. Some instructions will have served the general objective (limiting the spread of the virus), while others will have not. The heterogeneity seen among countries' decisions speaks for itself about the difficulty of knowing what the right decision is, as well as about how individualist we still are in believing that we will manage the crisis better than our neighbours. Nonetheless, it does not matter which strategy your country has adopted to contain virus dissemination, general failure has been the rule. Maybe, again, magical thinking has dragged us the wrong way.",

With regard to the former, the contention that infected patients with minor symptoms and no systemic disruption to stay at home is valuable. In the hospital, three main areas take leadership in the SARS-Cov-2 fight: the emergency department (ED), the hospitalisation wards (mainly in internal medicine, infectious disease, and respiratory departments) and the intensive care units. The latter two are crucial structures, and their ability to quickly increment their functional and structural capacities will have played a major role when the final count of the disease is presented to the citizens. During decades, Europeans have been proud of their public health system, and we have convinced ourselves that it will protect us against any health insult we face (another expression of magical thinking).",

They come to a usually overcrowded ED and, during most working hours, functioning at close to 100% of their possibilities [1] [2] [3] [4] . In addition, although European EDs are not homogeneous, either in spaces or in workforce organisation [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , the adaptive capacities of EDs and emergency physicians are huge [10, 11] . Some examples of the adaptations made in the Spanish EDs in response to the SARS-Cov-2 pressure on our system include an increase in areas dedicated to emergency care, the creation of differentiated pathways for patients with suspected SARS-Cov-2 disease, preparation of specific spaces for testing patients suspected of infection, training of emergency professionals on the use of self-protective equipment, the development of specific protocols for diagnosis and treatment, facing with very difficult and unanticipated decision-making, adaptation of the workforce to the surges of patients and of professional sick leaves, and rapid patient transition to general wards, despite the results of nasal/pharyngeal swap testing for SARS-Cov-2 still pending. These are probably not far from what other colleagues have implemented in their European EDs. And new situations will come and will put all of us in need of implementing other never before seen changes in our ED routines.",

This is not different from other previous pandemics [12] . This has not all been a problem of the system, and sometimes we have contributed to it. In fact, presenteeism (the opposite to absenteeism) is quite extended in healthcare providers [13] and has also played some role in the spread of the virus in certain settings. Indeed, although we sometime feel immune to diseases (magical thinking), we are, in fact, not.
