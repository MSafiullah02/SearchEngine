Its reported incidence ranges between 2 and 3 per 100,000 in the general population. Bone involvement at presentation can be found in 70 to 100% of patients: indeed, it is included in the CRAB (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, bony lesions) acronym of the most frequent presenting symptoms. Lytic bone disease is caused by plasma cells infiltration of the bone marrow and increased bone resorption; the osteolysis in turn causes severe bone pain, pathological fractures and, when occurring in the spine, also possible neurological compromise. Spine is the most common site of bony localization, with vertebral osteolytic lesions found in 70% of cases. Indeed, bone involvement is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in MM patients [3].",

A full spine MRI was obtained given the high sensitivity in identifying bony involvement in MM. Contrast-enhanced MRI was deemed unnecessary given that the diagnosis of MM was already established. The MRI showed a typical, variegated or \u201csalt and pepper\u201d pattern with diffuse small bone marrow focal lesions. Moreover, fat suppression sequences (STIR) showed marked hyperintensity compatible with recent fractures in T12, L1 and L2; on the contrary, no hyperintensity was observed in L4, thus suggesting an old osteoporotic fracture. No other fractures were found. On the basis of this, a diagnosis of pathological fractures in MM was made.",

In Italy, to reach those goals, elective surgery has been deferred, and only trauma surgery has been allowed to continue. Recently, several papers have been published from groups all over the world, proposing different algorithms to establish which orthopedics procedures cannot be postponed. We have previously reported our early experience of emergency spinal surgery during the first month of this pandemic; where we presented the diagnostic and management algorithm used to manage each spinal emergency in our Institution. This algorithm allowed us to significantly reduce surgical waiting times while maintaining the surgeon and patient safety; nevertheless, the case mix described in our previous paper, consisted in traumatic vertebral fractures or cord compression due to spondylodiscitis or neoplasms [5]. Indeed, other reports on urgent spine surgery during the pandemic highlighted the benefit of treating two broad categories of spinal disease as urgencies: first, acute traumatic fractures with spinal instability; and second, spinal cord or nerve root compression with severe pain or neurological deficit [1, 2]. In contrast, the case presented in this report cannot be included in the aforementioned categories; moreover, kyphoplasty in MM is usually postponed and undertaken only after failure of conservative treatment. Nonetheless, our decision making was based on several considerations: first, conservative treatment with bed rest immobilization and bracing can hamper the respiratory mechanics; furthermore, it limits the functional capabilities needed to undertake the frequent outpatient controls. Second, percutaneous kyphoplasty gives quick pain relief and fracture mechanical stability allowing an early and free mobilization of the patient and avoiding bed rest related complications. Finally, the patient could be quickly discharged after the surgery, therefore not overloading health-care resources and with a limited risk of nosocomial spreading of COVID-19.",

Answering our initial question on what is deferable during COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to highlight how a non-considered urgent procedure such as kyphoplasty can be the key for a right treatment. Indeed, in this case report, our decision making was not in accordance with an expert opinion on what is considered as urgent spinal surgery but was instead tailored to the specific needs of the patient. In these trying times, the physician should remember that sometimes urgency is not an absolute, but rather a relative concept.",
