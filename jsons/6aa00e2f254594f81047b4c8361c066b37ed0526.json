Cardiovascular (CV) clinicians are increasingly called to assist in the frontline pandemic response due to the substantial burden of CV complications 1 and growing shortages of specialized critical care providers. In this perspective, we outline key palliative care needs exposed by the pandemic and provide resources that may be useful to front-line clinicians in attending to these concerns.",

Key components of the evaluation are assessment of underlying vulnerabilities (including preexisting physical or psychological illness), identification of specific sources of stress (social isolation, infected friends or family members, financial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f obligations, caregiver burden), inventory of specific symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia), and sources of emotional and spiritual support. 4 Online tools to enhance clinical decision making and facilitate assessment of symptom severity are available from the American Psychiatric Association at https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educationalresources/assessment-measures. For those at highest risk, a multidisciplinary approach may be most helpful, with coordinated engagement of social workers, psychiatry, nursing and palliative care providers tailored to individual patient needs with attention to ensuring consistent messaging across disciplines. Since direct access to these resources may be limited by infection control precautions, telemedicine consultations are a reasonable alternative, and may be enhanced through the use of multi-participant videoconferencing to permit collaborative input from the patient, interested family members, and relevant members of the multidisciplinary team. For those who do not require formal mental health evaluation, supportive interventions designed to promote wellness and enhance coping may be relevant, many of which are readily available to patients and providers online (Table) . to individual therapy are critical, but should be complemented by efforts to buttress resilience among providers through restriction of prolonged work hours, provision of temporary housing to limit viral exposure to family members, and ensuring access to healthful diversions, including fitness and stress reduction programs.",
