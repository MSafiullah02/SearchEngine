Therefore, the CDC recommended using a new definition for ventilator-associated events (VAE), including infectious and other conditions. This definition includes only objective criteria and is perfectly reproducible [4]. However, recent studies and meta-analysis reported poor agreement between VAE, including ventilator-associated conditions (VAC), infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC), or probable VAP (pVAP) [5\u20137]. Few studies evaluated the agreement between VAE and VA-LRTI, including VAP and VAT. Although VAP and VAT are both associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, only VAP is associated with increased mortality rates [8]. Thus, it is probably important to distinguish VAP from VAT. In addition, the recent ATS/IDSA guidelines on VAP recommended not treating VAT patients with antimicrobial, based on the low quality of the available evidence [9]. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data to determine the agreement between VAE and VA-LRTI, including VAP and VAT. We also aimed to determine the impact of VAE on outcomes, including duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality.",

Our study and previous studies [5, 11] reported that an important percentage of VAE episodes were possibly related to VAP, and not to VAT. This clearly suggests that using alteration of oxygenation, i.e. PaO2/FiO2, could be helpful in differentiating VAP from VAT. Differentiating these two infections could be a difficult task, as the accuracy of chest X-ray in diagnosing new infiltrates is low [14\u201316]. However, it is still important to differentiate them, as antibiotic treatment is not recommended for VAT and inappropriate use of antimicrobials is a risk factor for subsequent emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria [17, 18]. Previous large observational studies and two small randomized controlled trials suggested beneficial effects of systemic and inhaled antibiotics. However, several limitations preclude definite conclusions on the interest of antimicrobials in patients with VAT, and further large multicentre randomized controlled trials are required.",

Few studies have focused on the preventability of VAE, but it seems that bundles applied for VAP prevention are not completely effective for VAE prevention [20\u201322]. Our results show that many VAE were non-infectious events as atelectasis, pleural effusion or acute pulmonary embolism.
