            "text": "Specifically, recommendations have been suggested to guide reorganization of urological surgeries [1] . Some surgical procedures that should still be performed during the COVID-19 pandemic have been identified, such as radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive or very highrisk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer; postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection; radical nephrectomy for cT3 tumors; nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial cancers; and adrenalectomy for specific adrenal cancers. It is also likely that some other surgical procedures (eg, radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer and partial nephrectomy for \uf0b3cT1b renal tumors) will be performed in centers located in areas not severely hit by the pandemic where the resources available are sufficient [2] . With this in mind, we read with enormous interest the paper by Zheng et al [3] . Based on the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in stools [4] , some reports on the presence of other viruses in Although, to the best of our knowledge, cases of this type of transmission have not been reported so far, this issue must be evaluated with particular caution for urologists still allowed to perform minimally invasive procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the need to use appropriate personal protective equipment should be reinforced. Second, nasopharyngeal samples should be considered for all patients undergoing such procedures, especially as COVID-19 positivity could have a possible impact on their postoperative course. Third, special care must be taken intraoperatively to reduce smoke formation (eg, lowering electrocautery power settings, using bipolar electrocautery, using electrocautery or ultrasonic scalpels parsimoniously to reduce surgical smoke, more extensive use of sutures and clips) or smoke dispersal in the operating room. This is especially important when removing trocars at the end of a procedure, when making a skin incision for specimen retrieval, and in the rare J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cases of conversion to open surgery. Before such steps, generous use of suction to remove smoke and aerosol should be recommended. In parallel, care must be taken to limit smoke dispersal or spillage from trocars (eg, lowering the pneumoperitoneum pressure). Finally, pressure-barrier insufflator systems that maintain a forced-gas pressure barrier at the proximal end of the trocar might be of benefit [5] .",
