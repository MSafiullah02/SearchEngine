During the first 2 months of life, passively acquired maternal antibodies are protective. However, as maternal antibody titers gradually decrease, infants become susceptible to severe disease. Cell-bound IgA may develop to help clear the virus. Circulating IgG directed against the glycoprotein (G) and fusion (F) proteins (operative in syncytia formation) on the viral surface will develop several days later. Infants less than 3 months of age appear to induce a weaker antibody response likely due to the presence of maternal antibodies.

Detection of the HBoV from the respiratory tract in symptomatic children and its absence of detection in non-symptomatic controls strongly suggest the virus to have a role in respiratory infections in children. Co-infection is commonly described in up to 60% of samples. It remains unclear if HBoV is a primary pathogen or acts to exacerbate other viral illnesses. The pathogenesis of HBoV has not been well described, but with the high occurrence of wheezing and lower respiratory tract symptoms in children infected with the virus, it is speculated that this virus may be a significant contributor to asthma exacerbations. The majority of infected children have rhinorrhea, cough, and wheezing, however, diarrhea has been reported in up to 25% of these children.

These include infants less than 6 weeks of age or infants with a history of prematurity, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, immunodeficiency or neurologic disease. Infants with RSV bronchiolitis typically have a combination of hyperinflation, pulmonary infiltrates, and atelectasis. Therefore, no one mode of ventilation can be recommended for all infants. Non-invasive positive pressure (NIIPP) modes (CPAP or BiPAP) may be attempted in infants where their primary respiratory embarrassment is secondary to atelectasis. However, this may not be suitable if the disease process appears severe or protracted as prolonged use of NIPP may make feeding difficult, cause breakdown of facial tissue, or be difficult to maintain without significant sedation that further compromises ventilation. If an infant requires endotracheal intubation, the mode of mechanical ventilation should be tailored to the predominant lung pathology present (i.e. atelectasis versus hyperinflation). Children with significant air trapping may need mechanical ventilation similar to a child with asthma, providing low respiratory rates and longer inspiration and exhalation times. The more typical infant will lose functional residual capacity (FRC) because of atelectasis and alveolar infiltrates. Therefore, despite having some air trapping, these infants often need PEEP to be adjusted to recruit alveoli and return FRC to normal. In the setting of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) which may occur in infants with congenital heart disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, lowering PVR by traditional methods such as maintaining oxygenation, deep sedation, muscle relaxation and even nitric oxide may be indicated.",

Children less than 18 years of age account for only approximately 5% of those affected, with a mean age of 12 years. No deaths were reported among children in the 2003 outbreak. Children and adults present with fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, mildly elevated activated partial thromboplastin times, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Radiographs of the chest show non-specific infiltrates. Apart from diarrhea, patients have minimal extrapulmonary symptoms. Early diagnosis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be made with 80% sensitivity on nasopharyngeal aspirates within the first 3 days of the illness. The clinical course follows a triphasic pattern. There is an incubation period of 2\u201310 days with a prodrome of high fever, chills, malaise, headache, and myalgias. Diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of adults. After 2\u20137 days, the disease progresses to involve the lower airways with a dry non-productive cough and dyspnea.

A regimen of antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids was proposed based on initial anecdotal success. However, ribavirin has demonstrated minimal activity against SARS-CoV isolates in vitro. Non-randomized studies of corticosteroids have reported favorable outcomes.

It is a unicellular organism that exists as a cyst (the diagnostic form). The organism attaches to the type I alveolar cells resulting in an alveolitis characterized by ventilation-perfusion mismatch and decreased pulmonary compliance. If untreated, PCP carries a mortality rate of 25\u201350%, and nearly 100% in the HIV-seropositive child. Fortunately, the incidence has markedly decreased with the administration of chemoprophylactic agents to high risk patients. Children typically present with fever, tachypnea, non-productive cough, and hypoxia with an absence of rales on auscultation of the chest. Initially, they may have an elevated pH and low carbon dioxide levels. Lactate dehydrogenase levels are generally elevated. Bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates are seen with initial hilar involvement subsequently spreading to the periphery (Fig. 25-4). Diagnosis is made by demonstrating the organism with the methenamine silver nitrate stain on pulmonary tissue, respiratory secretions, or lung fluid. Bronchoalveolar lavage is the most widely used technique to obtain lung fluid for diagnosis. Treatment consists of supportive therapy with supplemental oxygen; ultimately continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation may be necessary if respiratory failure occurs. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the recommended initial treatment. In patients that cannot tolerate TMP-SMX, then pentamidine isoethionate should be used. Corticosteroids in anti-inflammatory doses as an adjunct to antimicrobial therapy have improved clinical outcomes.

Which of the following therapies have been proven to be a consistent benefit for RSV bronchiolitis?A.AminophyllineB.BronchodilatorsC.CorticosteroidsD.RibavirinE.Supportive care\nPalivizumab is indicated for which of the following children?\nA.A 5 month old, former 27 week premature infant who just underwent surgical repair of a large ventricular septal defect who received palivizumab 2 weeks agoB.A 9 month old, former 28 week premature infant with mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia who received palivizumab 2 weeks agoC.A 1 month old, former 36 week premature infant with peripheral pulmonic stenosis who has never received palivizumabD.A 2 month old full term infant with a urea cycle defect who has never received palivizumabE.An 8 month old, former 25 week premature infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who received his fifth dose of palivizumab a month ago\nA 5 year old, unimmunized male with moderately severe asthma requires hospital admission with a 12 h history of fever, cough and myalgias in the middle of an H1N1 influenza outbreak. The most appropriate initial management of this child includes which of the following?\nA.Intravenous peramivir administered after confirming the diagnosis with rapid testingB.Intravenous zanamivir administered as soon as possibleC.Oral amantidine administered as soon as possibleD.Oral oseltamivir administered as soon as possibleE.Orally inhaled zanamivir administered after confirming the diagnosis with rapid testing\nA 7 year old presents with a high fever, respiratory distress, and a parapneumonic effusion on chest radiograph. Which of the following findings would MOST likely suggest the need for video-assisted thorascopic surgical drainage of this effusion?\nA.A mediastinal shift away from the effusionB.A pleural fluid pH  >  7.3 and glucose >200 mg/dLC.Persistent drainage for more than 5 days from a percutaneously-placed thoracentesis catheterD.The persistence of fever following 48 h of parenteral antibioticsE.The presence of loculations on ultrasound or computer tomography images\nA 4 year old male presents with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio  =  150), disseminated intravascular coagulation, and renal insufficiency secondary to catecholeamine-resistant shock. Rapid antigen testing identifies the H1N1 virus. In addition to oral oseltamivir, the initial antimicrobial coverage should include which of the following?\nA.CefepimeB.Intravenous immunoglobulinC.Intravenous zanamivirD.Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazoleE.Vancomycin\nA 16 year old male presents with a 3 day history of fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. On clinical exam, he is febrile, tachypneic with scattered rales, and hypotensive. There is no rash or evidence of animal bite on exam. His initial laboratory results are remarkable for thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis with an increased percentage of circulating immunoblasts, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. His prothrombin time is 16 s. He is admitted and his respiratory status continues to deteriorate ultimately requiring mechanical ventilation. He remains in refractory shock for several days. After an extensive diagnostic work-up, he is diagnosed with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome based on the detection of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin M.
