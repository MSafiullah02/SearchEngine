            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis is a systemic, fatal, viral-induced immune-mediated disease primarily affecting younger cats [1, 2]. It is caused by a virulent biotype of feline coronaviruses (FCoV) known as FIPV. Previously used therapies for FIP have either relied on immunosuppressive agents to dampen clinical signs temporarily, or attempted to repurpose human antiviral treatments, with neither approach achieving lasting success [3]. Recently, therapeutic drugs have been identified that address the underlying problem of feline coronavirus replication [4, 5]. However, veterinary access to these antiviral treatments is currently problematic. Consequently, additional inexpensive, safe, antiviral treatments, such as those accessible by prescription, require investigation for their potential to treat FIPV infected cats. The demand for efficacious antivirals against FIPV is crucial both for reducing clinical disease with minimal adverse effects, as well as the potential for preventing individual treatments selecting for viral resistance.",

            "text": "The antimalarial drug mefloquine is currently used for both prevention (as a monotherapy) and treatment (either alone, or in combination with artesunate) of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in humans [6\u20138]. It was found to substantially reduce the viral load of FIPV and feline calicivirus (FCV) at low concentrations in infected Crandell Rees feline kidney cells without cytotoxic effects [9, 10]. This observation suggested that mefloquine may be useful when administered to cats with FIP or FCV related disease [9]. However, mefloquine undergoes substantial hepatic metabolism in people [11, 12]. As cats lack several major phenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes required for phase II glucuronidative metabolism [13, 14], it is prudent to obtain information about mefloquine\u2019s intrinsic clearance in the cat before conducting clinical trials in the live animal. Although there are many models by which to assess in vitro metabolism, microsomes contain many (but not all) hepatic metabolic enzymes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to ascertain mefloquine\u2019s in vitro intrinsic clearance (in vitro Clint) when incubated with feline hepatic microsomes with respect to both phase I (e.g., oxidation, hydrolysis or reduction reactions) and phase II (e.g., conjugative glucuronidation) metabolism. Likewise, mefloquine was also incubated with canine microsomes for both phase I and phase II metabolism reactions in order to compare the rate of in vitro clearance of mefloquine between feline and canine microsomes. Mefloquine\u2019s phase I metabolism by canine microsomes has been previously reported [11] and in contrast to cats, dogs are not known to experience delayed phase II conjugative metabolism. Mefloquine was also incubated with microsomes from the common brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) as this species of possum is recognised as a rapid xenobiotic metaboliser [15].",

HPLC grade acetonitrile, HPLC grade methanol and ethyl acetate were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia). Hepatic microsomes from pooled male cats and pooled male beagles were purchased from BioreclamationIVT (Frankfurt, Germany; product numbers S00709 and M00201, respectively), shipped on liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C prior to use. The common brush-tailed possum microsomes (2 females and one male) were extracted and prepared according to Hill (2003) [16] and modified by Kimble et al. (2014) [15]. Prior to liver collection, possums were euthanized with pentobarbitone for humane reasons independent of this study. These animals demonstrated no outward clinical signs of hepatic disease and their livers appeared grossly unremarkable on post-mortem examination. Liver collection was approved by The University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (AEC protocol: 2013/6062). Commercially procured feline and canine microsomes had a hepatic microsomal protein concentration of 20 mg/mL as did those of the common brush-tailed possum microsomes. The activity of the canine and feline microsomes as determined by the manufacturer are presented in the Supplementary information file (S1 Table). The common brush-tailed possum hepatic microsomal protein concentration was measured using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) standardized with bovine serum albumin [17]. The pooled hepatic feline and canine microsomes contained enzymes from three individuals.",

The 10 \u03bcM final concentration of mefloquine was selected as it was the same concentration used by McDonagh et al. (2014) in FIPV infected Crandell Rees feline kidney cells [10]. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding a 1.0 mg/mL concentration of either feline or canine microsomal protein and 0.5 mg/mL of brush-tailed possum microsomal protein. Collectively, the microsomes, enzyme co-factors and solvents are referred to as a \u201cmatrix\u201d. During incubation the matrix was gently agitated with the pipette tip and 500 \u03bcL aliquots were removed at time (t) = 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes. For the possum incubation aliquots were removed at t = 0, 30 and 60 minutes. Each extracted aliquot was mixed with 250 \u03bcL of ice-cold methanol (which also contained 10 \u03bcM of the IS) to deactivate the reaction. Once the reaction was deactivated, mefloquine samples underwent liquid-liquid extraction whereby 200 \u03bcL of each sample was added to 1.6 mL of ethyl acetate, vortexed and then centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g for five minutes. The organic layer was then transferred to a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube and dried in a Thermo Fisher Scientific Speed Vac. concentrator (Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia) at 30\u00b0C for one hour. The dried residue was reconstituted in 100 \u03bcL of 50% methanol. The reconstituted samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g for five minutes to remove any particulates.

The enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding a solution consisting of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, purified water, 5.0 mM UDPGA and 0.64 mL of 50 mM MgCl2. During the incubation the matrix was gently agitated with the pipette tip and 100 \u03bcL aliquots were removed at time (t) = 0, 60, 180 and 360 minutes. Each extracted aliquot was mixed with 100 \u03bcL of ice-cold methanol (which also contained 10 \u03bcM of IS) to deactivate the reaction. Once the reaction was deactivated, each sample with mefloquine as the substrate underwent liquid-liquid extraction as per the phase I reaction. The organic layer was then transferred to a new 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube and dried in the concentrator at 30\u00b0C for one hour. The dried residue was reconstituted in 100 \u03bcL of 50% methanol. The reconstituted samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g for five minutes to remove any particulates. The supernatant was injected into the HPLC system. All samples, including controls, were run as duplicates.",

This is consistent with other observations that mefloquine undergoes in vitro phase I metabolism in other species, including humans [11, 12], rats [11, 28] and monkeys [11]. However, mefloquine has also been demonstrated to undergo very slow phase I metabolism with canine microsomes [11]. Fontaine et al. (2000) [11] reported that 85% of mefloquine remained in canine samples after a five-hour microsomal incubation whereas close to 100% of mefloquine was metabolized via phase I biotransformation by canine primary hepatocytes after 39-hours incubation. Whilst longer incubations are sometimes required (> 2 hours) [21], prolonged microsomal incubations were not undertaken in this study due to concerns of extended incubation times resulting in declining enzyme activity [20] and ultimately an underestimation of intrinsic clearance. Here, unchanged canine microsomal mefloquine depletion percentages greater than 100% indicated that no substrate depletion had occurred in these samples after 90 minutes. Although arguably the duration used in this study was short, canine microsomal incubations undertaken for more than 360 minutes likewise did not demonstrate mefloquine depletion. It is possible that some mefloquine depletion may have occurred but went undetected by HPLC due to assay insensitivity.",

Mefloquine phase I feline microsomal incubations generated an unknown peak that increased in amplitude over time. This peak was subsequently identified by SRM as carboxymefloquine but it was also identified by SRM in both the canine incubation samples and the negative controls. Carboxymefloquine is not considered a metabolite generated by the feline microsomes because of its presence in negative controls and phase I metabolism reactions are not associated with carboxylation. It is likely that identification of this substrate is associated with mefloquine instability from processing. This mefloquine instability could explain the slight reversal of mefloquine depletion with feline microsomes between 60 and 90 mins of incubation (Fig 2). Identification of hydroxymefloquine was not pursued as it is only produced in relatively minor amounts [11, 12] and its m/z value has not been established.",

Canine and common brush-tailed possum microsome incubations were used as the positive control for this phase II reaction as they have been shown to deplete ODMT to ODMT glucuronide [22]. This study supports the hypothesis that phase II conjugative metabolism may not be a route of mefloquine metabolism in any species. Fontaine et al. (2000) [11, 12] dismissed the contribution of phase II conjugative glucuronidation in the biotransformation of mefloquine because none of the unidentified mefloquine metabolites produced by the dog, rat and monkey hepatocyte studies were hydrolysed by \u03b2-glucuronidase. It is therefore likely that mefloquine does not undergo phase II conjugative glucuronidation and will not present the issues associated with the administration of other drugs that undergo this route of metabolism to cats (e.g., acetaminophen/paracetamol) [13, 29, 30].",

However, as microsomes only contain phase I drug metabolising enzymes (DMEs) such as CYPs, flavin-containing monooxygenases and phase II UGTs, they therefore do not represent the entire spectrum of DMEs [31].

Although this is not uncommon practice, use of pooled microsomes may have overlooked differences in one or more individual\u2019s metabolic capacity. Moreover, during the phase II metabolism studies, phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was used as described by Slovak et al. (2017) [14]. However, the use of Tris buffer (as opposed to a phosphate buffer) has been shown to lead to an increase in the activity of some UGTs (such as UGT1A4 and UGT1A9) when incubated with human liver microsomes [32]. Yet, as this was a comparative species microsomal study, the use of phosphate buffer should have little consequence unless a species had significantly different concentrations and/or activities of hepatic UGTs. Furthermore, in contrast to the common brush-tailed possums microsomes that were harvested by the authors, the feline and canine microsomes were purchased from Europe since they could not be sourced locally. Although quality control information concerning activity for various substrates was provided by the manufacturer, the results may have been different if the microsomes from all three species underwent the same extraction, transportation and storage conditions. Finally, as the canine and feline microsomes only contained contributions from male subjects, the activity of CYP3A is recognized to have different activity for a substrate which is sex dependent [33], therefore further research evaluating sex differences in substrate intrinsic clearance may be required.",

One of these agents is a broad spectrum coronavirus protease inhibitor, GC376 [48], while the other is an adenosine nucleoside analogue, GS-441524 [4, 5]. However, neither of these antivirals have obtained registration for veterinary use. Consequently, it remains important that investigations into a readily available drug such as mefloquine with anti-FIPV activity, is urgently required for this invariably fatal disease. This in vitro study provides information on mefloquine\u2019s hepatic metabolism in cats and indicates that it does not result in delayed metabolism in cats. Further studies should be undertaken to describe mefloquine\u2019s PK profile in the cat as well as its efficacy in treating FIPV and FCV infected cats.",
