Substantial investment in international multi-country research and vaccine implementation will undoubtedly reduce the burden of disease and lead to refinements of current guidelines. The current WHO clinical criteria for identification of pneumonia aim at prioritising sensitivity over specificity. Thus, emerging results from prospective studies of hospitalised children with WHO criteria for pneumonia indicate that it encompasses a much broader range of aetiologies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, than those likely to be averted by current and planned public health measures, such as immunisation programmes or early identification and pre-hospital antimicrobial treatment\n5,\n14. Adverse outcomes are not uncommon, despite early diagnosis and treatment\n5,\n14,\n15. As the clinical syndrome of pneumonia is very common amongst hospitalised children, the high early mortality remains a significant barrier to improving survival statistics\n14\u2013\n16, important for attainment of Sustainable Developmental Goals\u2019 targets on health.",

The strongest prognostic factors for mortality were coma, bradycardia (<80 beats per min) or severe tachycardia (>220 beats per min). Included in the PETAL score were additional laboratory markers lactate, urea and pH which added further information to the score. Oxygen saturation, although considered important in other studies, did not significantly improve the discriminative ability of the score in PETAL dataset and therefore not included in the final model.",

At the same centre, this was further explored in a case-control study examining pathogenic aetiology of children aged <5 years hospitalised with SP, in the era prior to the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine. Out of the 984 cases, 810 (84%) were eligible to be enrolled in the study. Of these 232 (29%) fulfilled WHO clinical signs of VSP. Out of the 749 with blood cultures result, 52 (7%) were positive in cases, of which 30/52 (58%) were\nStreptococcus pneumoniae. Bacterial aetiology was established in 23% (SPN=viral in 13%, mixed in 2% and 63% were of unknown aetiology)\n14. There was no association found between most causes of viral infection of the nasopharynx and pneumonia, except for respiratory syncytial virus. No identifiable pathogen was found in any of the deaths. In a study conducted in Fijian children with a discharge diagnosis of LRTI, only 34% met WHO standardised criteria for chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia\n25. Thus, after the introduction of the PCV vaccine, which has now been implemented across all the proposed sites for the COAST trial, the proportion of children with actual bacterial pneumonia will be substantially lower than the estimates approximately by 50%, generated from previous studies preceding the era of pneumococcal vaccination role out.",

Hypoxaemia is common amongst critically ill patients (with and without pneumonia) and usually is treated with oxygen and, where available and indicated, ventilatory strategies with the aim to restore arterial oxygenation to normal values and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypoxaemia. This said, strategies used to treat hypoxaemic critically ill patients are also associated with harm, and this harm may outweigh the benefit of an increase in arterial oxygenation. Oxygen has been used in the treatment of pneumonia for a large part of the last century. However, the recognition of pulmonary oxygen toxicity as a problem has been relatively recent. Toxicity is related to the concentration of oxygen and length of exposure. Oxygen causes tracheobronchial irritation, reduced mucociliary function (even in healthy volunteers exposed to 90\u201395% oxygen for three hours\n37) and, eventually, adsorption atelectasis, decreased vital capacity and changes similar to adult-type respiratory distress syndrome\n38. The biochemical basis is considered to be due to damage to tissues through the production of reactive oxygen species. For these reasons it is recommended that inspired oxygen concentration (FiO\n2) should be carefully titrated against SpO\n2. However, oxygen toxicity has wider consequences, beyond the pulmonary system with animal models showing reduction coronary blood flow. Moreover, as haemoglobin is fully saturated with oxygen, supra-physiological oxygen tensions have little additional oxygen content compared to blood with physiological oxygen tensions.",

Much of the concern for optimising oxygenation has centred on neuroprotection or prevention of cognitive deficits in the long term, but the evidence supporting this is weak. In a follow-up study of mechanically ventilated adult patients with acute lung injury, a lower partial pressure of arterial oxygen (but not oxygen saturation) was associated with cognitive impairment\n45. No equivalent studies are available for paediatric cohorts. A systematic review in children with chronic or recurrent hypoxaemia indicated adverse effects on development, behaviour, and academic achievement; however generalising these findings are complicated since most studies had small sample sizes and did not stratify by SaO\n2\n46.",

In 2015, a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, equivalence trial of oxygen threshold strategies in infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months with clinician-diagnosed bronchiolitis was reported. The trial compared two strategies targeting an oxygen saturation threshold of 90% (n=308) and 94% (n=307). The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough (considered to reflect the degree of airway inflammation and thus influence the degree of hypoxaemia). In both arms, median time to cough resolution was 15 days (95% CI for difference \u20131 to 2), thus oxygen thresholds were equivalent. Adverse events were similar in both arms\n26. The study concluded that management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90% or higher is as safe and clinically effective; this suggested further studies in older children examining oxygen thresholds are needed, particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce.",

The use of a head box showed a non-statistically significant trend towards a reduced risk of treatment failure compared to the NPC (one non-RCT; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.12). NPs are associated with fewer nasal obstruction problems. The quality of the evidence was judged to be very low.",

The primary outcome was treatment failure (i.e.clinical failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation, death, or termination of hospital stay against medical advice) after more than 30 minutes of treatment. In total, 79 (35%) children were randomized to receive oxygen therapy by bubble CPAP, 67 (30%) to low-flow oxygen therapy, and 79 (35%) to high-flow oxygen therapy. The trial was stopped twice once after the first interim analysis and finally after the second interim analysis after only 25% of the predicted sample size were enrolled, on the recommendation of the data monitoring committee. Treatment was declared to have failed for 31 (14%) children, of whom five (6%) had received bubble CPAP, 16 (24%) had received low-flow oxygen therapy, and ten (13%) had received high-flow oxygen therapy. Treatment failure was lower in the CPAP group than in the low-flow oxygen therapy group (relative risk [RR] 0.27, 99.7% CI 0.07-0.99; p=0.0026). No difference in treatment failure was noted between patients in the bubble CPAP and those in the high-flow oxygen therapy group (RR 0.50, 99.7% 0.11-2.29; p=0.175). 23 (10%) children died. Three (4%) children died in the bubble CPAP group, ten (15%) children died in the low-flow oxygen therapy group, and ten (13%) children died in the high-flow oxygen therapy group, indicating that bubble CPAP group had significantly lower rates of death than the children who received oxygen by low-flow oxygen therapy (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.89; p=0.022). The authors concluded that bubble CPAP improved outcomes in Bangladeshi children with VSP and hypoxaemia compared with standard low-flow oxygen therapy, but the early cessation of the trial reduces the certainty of the findings and suggested that further research was required before guidelines could be changed.",

Options for supportive care in hospitals without access to mechanical ventilation are limited. At present, there is uncertainty as to what the best cut-off threshold for cost-effective oxygen delivery is and whether the addition of high flow is safe and results in improved outcome. Since hypoxaemia is so common and treatment costs and practicalities for optimal delivery of oxygen are complex, the COAST trial will contribute substantial new knowledge in this area. The COAST trial was proposed and discussed at the launch meeting of ISARIC in Annecy, July 2012. The meeting brought together many leading researchers and clinical trialists in severe respiratory illnesses with representation from international agencies, such as the WHO. The proposal had wide support as it was anticipated that the trial would result in refinements to the current WHO recommendations and provide robust evidence to support the targeting of oxygen to those with the greatest need and averting unnecessary consumption in financially constrained hospitals. The pragmatic nature of COAST and locations chosen will mean that the results of the trial will be immediately generalisable. The successful conduct of the FEAST Trial acts as a pilot for the conduct of COAST. The proposed high flow oxygen delivery device is in current use in South Africa, and feasibility testing and staff training in the COAST sites will occur before trial commencement. The COAST trial was preceded by the Paediatric Oxygenation Strategies Treatment Study (POST), a feasibility study, which assessed feasibility of both the intervention and the RCT processes (including testing whether high flow oxygen via the AirVO\n2\nTM device can be used effectively in a hospital in Africa). The POST study helped inform the trial protocol for COAST (Maitland\net al., manuscript in preparation).",

Based on these data, it was estimated that two thirds of eligible children would present with SpO\n2 \u226580% (FEAST 63%; Kilifi 69%). Baseline 48-hour mortality for children receiving low flow oxygen was assumed to be 9% for children with SpO\n2 \u226580% (FEAST 10%; Kilifi 9%) and 26% with SpO\n2<80% (FEAST 30%; Kilifi 26%). Due to the complex nature of the design, power calculations were undertaken by simulating datasets under the assumed alternative hypotheses and calculating the proportion of simulated datasets in which a significant effect (P<0.05) was detected for each of the two comparisons\n74. Based on these simulations, a total sample size of 4,200 children would give 90% power to detect a clinically relevant difference of a 33% RR reduction associated with liberal oxygenation compared with permissive hypoxaemia, and a clinically relevant difference of a 25% RR reduction for high flow compared with low flow oxygen delivery.",

However broad range 16S rDNA PCR is subject to artefact from endogenous and exogenous bacterial products\n75\u2013\n77 and therefore without either sequencing the PCR product, or carrying out more sensitive qPCR, there is concern that changes in the qPCR may not be due to circulating organisms. Unfortunately, sequencing the 16S rDNA has so far yielded results compatible with environmental contamination rather than recognised gut commensals. The use of specific primers renders qPCR less vulnerable to background contaminants than broad-range 16S rDNA PCR, and therefore more sensitive\n78,\n79.

            "text": "Systematic and policy reviews have indicated the need for formal evaluation of the hypoxaemia threshold for which oxygen should be targeted and how best to administer oxygen; thus COAST was designed in response. The trial is pragmatic, enrolling children presenting with respiratory symptoms and hypoxaemia, and thus will include large subgroups of children with pneumonia, malaria and other critical illness. This will ensure that the results are applicable to health services in Africa that typically have little or no access to specialist respiratory support facilities. The trial was designed to address the poor outcomes of children in sub-Saharan Africa, which are associated with high rates of in-hospital mortality, 9\u201310% (for those with oxygen saturations between 80% and 92%) and 26\u201330% case fatality for those with oxygen saturations <80%, indicating that the current recommendations and/or management strategies are not working in practice. COAST trial will target children, but not newborns, as this group require a separate trial designed to address a different set of objectives and interventions. The COAST trial aims to provide the relevant evidence for policy makers and health services by evaluating key elements of an integrated management strategy in African hospitals on the basis of clinical effectiveness and costs. The health economics component is vital to ensuring that we provide evidence not just on effectiveness, but also cost-effectiveness, to allow policymakers to make decisions on how best to allocate scarce health resources.",
