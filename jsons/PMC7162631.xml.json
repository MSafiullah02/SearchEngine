At a time when I couldn't even lift the weight of a grown-up\u2019s full-size VHS camcorder, the PXL-2000 was a lightweight marvel of point-and-shoot simplicity. While my filmmaking ambitions rarely went beyond making my stuffed animals act out scenes from Star Wars, I somehow knew that communicating through video would be a defining feature of whatever it was that I would grow up to do.",

This method \u2013 which shares indistinct boundaries with similar teaching strategies variously referred to as the \u2018flipped classroom\u2019 or \u2019active learning\u2019 \u2013 relies on the students preparing for class by reading a chapter or watching a video and completing an assignment [2]. Class time is then used for problem solving in groups, with the professor behaving more as a \u2018coach\u2019 than a \u2018performer\u2019. The descriptor \u2018flipped\u2019 is thus twofold: problems ordinarily assigned as homework are done in class and peers do much of the teaching.",

In the original conception of peer instruction, the material was envisioned to be a selection from a textbook that the student was directed to \u2018read before coming to class\u2019. Some courses, however, are not amenable to prereading. For example, the textbook usually contains much more information than can be reasonably covered in one semester or quarter and animations are impossible to render on a printed page. Moreover, the level of writing in a textbook is often obscure and the usage is sometimes unsympathetic to new learners.",

Moreover, with the use of video it is possible to use gestures and facial expressions to communicate a level of subtlety that is impossible with writing alone. When a video is recorded in front of a live audience, expressions of confusion can cause an instructor to change their tack. Even when recording lectures in an empty classroom or office, an experienced instructor has often internalized the type of reaction an ill-formulated explanation is likely to elicit and can explain the concept again in a different way, in real time.",

            "text": "In 2017, I decided to start recording my lectures for use in future courses. I did this for three reasons. (i) I did not feel it was a good use of my time to give the same lectures year after year, semester after semester. Preparing for these lectures often involved rememorizing derivations and other repetitive tasks that left little substrate for imagination. Why not record these lectures for my students (and myself) to learn from in future years? (ii) With the lectures recorded, I could use them as a \u2018video textbook\u2019 for my courses. I would thus be free to \u2018flip\u2019 all of my classrooms, to transform class time from a traditional lecture \u2013 which the students have already seen \u2013 into a variety show comprising real-world applications, problem-solving strategies, and group design challenges. (iii) By putting these lectures online and making them freely available, it was possible to reach a vastly greater number of viewers than I could by delivering live, unrecorded lectures. As of this writing, my YouTube channel (\u2018Darren Lipomi\u2019; Figure 1\n) has over 5000 subscribers with course material that has been viewed roughly 500 000 times. These statistics vastly outnumber my \u2018impact\u2019 as a researcher, at least by any citation metric.",

Given the lack of time available to adjust, many instructors are understandably struggling to develop an approach. The default strategy emerging appears to be to mimic live lectures, but using an online platform. By contrast, I favor an approach that uses prerecorded lectures of the usual length (perhaps somewhat abbreviated) complemented by separate discussions involving the full class. These sections can take place at a set time, perhaps twice per week. This format preserves the strengths of the video lecture; namely, the ability of the students to watch it on their own schedule and to fast forward, pause, and rewind. It also preserves the type of interaction amenable to the flipped classroom, especially if the platform allows virtual \u2018breakout\u2019 rooms for peer-to-peer interaction. Furthermore, prerecorded lectures offer the opportunity to use somewhat higher production values than are available with webcams and onboard laptop microphones.",

A principle value of the instructor is the ability to serve as a learning coach and professional role model. While platforms such as Khan Academy are extraordinarily useful for teaching individual topics, their reliance on tablet-drawn diagrams and voice-over narration remove the instructor\u2019s face from the presentation; this distancing is to the detriment of empathy and inspiration that one might derive from interacting with a human instructor in a semester-long course.",

            "text": "Depending on the budgetary constraints, a stand-alone 4K video camera should be used, along with a high-quality tripod. Sound should always be recorded in duplicate. An amateur creator such as myself inadvertently fails to record usable audio about 10% of the time and thus a backup source is critical. For recording in lecture halls, I recommend wearing two lapel (\u2018lavalier\u2019) mics, one connected to a stand-alone recorder (e.g., the Zoom H1) and one connected to a wireless transmitter whose receiver is plugged into the camera. For recording in the office, I recommend plugging a lavalier mic with a long cable directly into the input jack of the camcorder. The audio from the microphone embedded in the camcorder is usually of poor quality, although it is sometimes useful on editing as a fiducial mark to sync the higher-quality audio recorded independently. In offices, uncovered concrete, glass, and sheetrock walls produce reverb, which can be suppressed with a few slabs of acoustic foam. To avoid radio frequency (RF) interference, cell phones should also be kept away from audio equipment.",

            "text": "The quality of the image is determined by three things: resolution, stability, and lighting. It is best to record your source material as a 4K master. External hard drives can store many hours of ultrahigh-definition content at low cost. With most amateur camcorders, resolution degrades with lack of stability. If you want someone to follow you around a lecture hall with the camera, a thick-legged tripod with smooth tracking is essential; a gimbal for stabilization is also helpful. With lighting, the goal is to reduce shadows on the performer\u2019s face. That is, light sources should be diffuse and behind the camera. If there is a window in the office, it should also be behind the camera. A good investment would be a pair of square LED arrays to eliminate shadows. It is not vanity: I have found from the analytics of my more amateurish uploads that they have poorer audience retention and fewer views than the ones in which I paid greater attention to quality.",

Nevertheless, around half of my videos are uploaded with no processing. A helpful trick is to use a camcorder that can be started and stopped using a smartphone, and thus it is rarely necessary to clip the beginning and end from a video. This simple step saves potentially hours of resaving minimally edited videos.",
