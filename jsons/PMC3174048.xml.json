First, all microarrays were analyzed with the E-Predict algorithm,17 using a significance value of P < .01 to identify microarrays with statistically significant viral hybridization patterns (176 of 278). To generate an optimized set of oligonucleotide intensity weights for the third-generation Virochip platform, we took the remaining 102 presumably negative microarrays and manually fit a set of functions with the general equationw=[(1\u2212(i\u2212ab\u2212a)p)]1p if a<i<b; w=1 if a<i<b; or w=0 if i>b, where w is a weight (value from 0 to 1) for a given oligonucleotide, i is the median of sum-normalized intensities of that oligonucleotide across the 102 negative microarrays, and lower boundary a is the median of medians of the sum-normalized intensities of all oligonucleotides. The upper boundary condition b was expressed as b=a+c \u03c3, where c is a constant and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of sum-normalized intensities of the oligonucleotide across the 102 negative microarrays. A total of 40 weight sets with c and p as fitting measurements were evaluated using E-Predict profile separation statistics on 6 rhinovirus (RV)-positive, 6 RSV-positive, 4 HPIV-3\u2013positive, and 2 FluA-positive microarrays. The optimal performance was achieved with weights corresponding to c = 0.15 and p = 1.5. These weights were used to generate negative null distributions based on the set of 102 negative microarrays mentioned above, and final microarray virus determinations were made by E-Predict. A microarray was considered E-predict\u2013positive for a given virus if the corresponding energy profile attained a significance value of P < .05.",

Location of sample collection was classified as outpatient (clinic or emergency department) or hospital admission. Presenting illness was defined as an upper RTI (ie, cough and/or congestion with or without fever or a clinician's diagnosis), lower RTI (ie, clinician's diagnosis of asthma exacerbation, bronchiolitis, croup, or pneumonia), or no respiratory illness (eg, febrile illness, seizures, or DFA collected on a routine basis, such as before transplantation surgery). Immunocompromised patients were defined as children with solid organ or bone marrow transplants, congenital or acquired immune deficiencies (including those on chemotherapy), or human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with respiratory failure were defined as children who developed acute respiratory decompensation necessitating mechanical ventilation as a result of their respiratory illness.

In patients with RTI, DFA detected a virus in only 36% of the samples, whereas the Virochip detected a virus in 64%, for a 75% improvement in the rate of detection. Detection of viruses not included in the DFA panel (non-DFA viruses) accounted for approximately 1/3 of all Virochip-positive identifications. Among these non-DFA viruses, picornaviruses was the largest group (74% of samples positive for a non-DFA virus, or 16% of all samples from patients with RTIs). These picornaviruses included 16 RVs, 14 EVs, and 1 parechovirus. Besides the picornaviruses, the Virochip identified 4 HMPV and 2 CoV infections from patients with RTIs. Human cytomegalovirus\u2013like sequences were detected in 1 sample from 1 febrile patient with pneumonia. In 7 samples, the Virochip detected viruses not typically associated with respiratory disease and of doubtful clinical significance; these viruses included polyomaviruses (SV40 and JC viruses), plant viruses commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract (nanoviruses and geminiviruses),21 and bovine leukemia virus, a virus ubiquitous in cow's milk.22 A virus was detected in a higher proportion of patients with upper RTIs (68%) and bronchiolitis (77%) than in those with pneumonia (54%) or asthma exacerbation (41%). In patients with nonrespiratory illnesses (typically febrile illnesses of uncertain origin), the Virochip detected a virus in 30% of the samples, with the majority accounted for by picornaviruses, whereas DFA detected a virus in only 3%. Overall, at least 1 of the 7 DFA viruses was identified by Virochip in 31% of the RTI samples (n = 86), compared with 25% identified by DFA (n = 72), corresponding to a 19% overall increase in detection by the Virochip compared with DFA (P < .01 by \u03c72 analysis).",

Because these results were inconsistent with the rates of detection using clinically validated PCR assays for the other viruses (RSV and FluA), we further analyzed the 23 discrepant samples in a blinded fashion using a more sensitive clinically validated real-time PCR assay for RV/EV.20 Results obtained by combining these 2 assays show that the Virochip had overall high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (99%) for detection of RV/EV (Figure 2C).",

Similar attempts to confirm the remaining 3 Virochip-positive/PCR-negative cases with the limited amount of sample available were unsuccessful.

Another significant advantage of a panviral microarray over DFA is the ability to screen for all known viruses simultaneously.

Two cases of double infection, in which both viruses could be detected by DFA in principle, were characterized as single-virus infections by DFA. Previous studies have suggested that double-virus infections are associated with greater severity of RTI.27 Higher efficiency of the microarray in detecting critical as well as double-virus infections is an important advantage of the method; timely detection of such infections may allow clinicians to avoid unnecessary antibiotics and invasive procedures and begin appropriate antiviral treatment, if available.",

First, setting up the technology entails significant initial startup costs, including the cost of the microarray printer and viral oligonucleotides, as well as ongoing material and labor costs. Second, the turnaround time for the assay is currently \u223c24 hours; it may be possible to decrease the processing duration by using ultra-rapid polymerases for amplification or controlled agitation techniques during hybridization. Third, reproducibility and consistent array quality are of concern. In our study, none of the microarray assays had to be repeated, and the inherent probe redundancy built into the method makes the assay robust for the purpose of virus detection. For example, of the 300 oligonucleotide probes on the Virochip designed to hybridize to rhinoviruses, as few as 4 high-intensity oligonucleotides are sufficient to make a successful virus identification. Statistical methods for interpreting the microarray data, as exemplified by E-Predict, can be completely automated, allowing ease of use and freedom from operator bias. Smaller microarrays aimed at detecting targeted virus sets (eg, respiratory viruses only) would reduce costs and simplify issues of reproducibility, quality control, and data analysis.",
