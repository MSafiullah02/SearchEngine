Between 2007 and 2017, 585 children underwent 620 allogeneic HSCT procedures. Out of 75 patients with a positive NPA screen (12%), transplant was delayed in 25 cases (33%), while 53 children started conditioning with a VRI. Patients undergoing HSCT with a positive NPA screen had a significantly lower overall survival (54% vs. 79%) and increased TRM (26% vs. 7%) compared to patients with a negative NPA. Patients with a positive NPA who delayed transplant and cleared the virus before conditioning had improved overall survival (90%) and lower TRM (5%). Pre-HSCT positive NPA was the only significant risk factor for progression to a lower respiratory tract infection and was a major risk factor for TRM. Transplant delay, whenever feasible, in case of a positive NPA screen for VRIs can positively impact on survival of children undergoing HSCT.",

            "text": "Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for several haematological (Peters et al, 2010) and immunological disorders (Freeman, 2018) , as well as an alternative approach to enzyme replacement therapy in some inborn errors of metabolism (de Ru et al, 2011) . However, infections are a major cause of treatment failure and contribute significantly to transplant-related mortality (TRM) (Atay et al, 2018) . Viral infections are difficult to control in immunocompromised hosts, such as transplanted patients, due to impaired humoral and cell-mediated immunity post-HSCT because of in vivo (serotherapy) (Lamba et al, 2005) or ex vivo (alpha/beta and B cells depletion) lymphodepletion (Laberko et al, 2017) and immunosuppressants used to treat graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Currently, there are no clear recommendations on screening and monitoring for respiratory viruses in children undergoing HSCT and there is very little evidence on efficacy of anti-viral drugs (Hirsch et al., 2013) . Despite a lower prevalence compared to herpes family viruses or adenovirus reactivation, respiratory viruses can be responsible for severe lower respiratory tract infections that can negatively affect transplant outcome (Boeckh, 2008; Dokos et al, 2013; Chemaly et al, 2014) . Epidemiological studies have shown an incidence of upper and lower respiratory infections in children undergoing HSCT of around 20-30% (Bredius et al, 2004; Verdeguer et al, 2011; Srinivasan et al, 2011a Srinivasan et al, , 2013 . Progression to a lower respiratory tract infection can be influenced by patients' age and lack of immune reconstitution after transplant (El Saleeby et al, 2008; Srinivasan et al, 2011b; Gooskens et al, 2016) . Overall, there are few specific recommended anti-viral treatments, and for a large proportion of respiratory viruses there is no evidence on efficacy for prophylaxis or therapy (Hirsch et al., 2013; Dignan et al, 2016) .",

We considered patients with active VRI at the time of transplant when they had a positive NPA before the start of the conditioning regimen.

We found a statistically higher survival rate in patients that delayed HSCT and started the conditioning regimen after resolving the VRI (OS = 90\u00c15%) compared to patients that (Fig 2A) .

We also evaluated the stratification of 100-day TRM in these groups of patients (Fig 2B) . Children that presented with a positive NPA screen at the time of transplant had a significantly higher 100-day TRM (26\u00c15%, HR 4\u00c14, CI 95 1\u00c19-12, P < 0\u00c1001), while no significant difference in early mortality was observed in patients with new VRIs (7%), and no VRIs at the time of transplant due to delay of the procedure (5%) or no occurrence of respiratory infections (7%).

We also investigated the impact of rhinovirus infection on outcome (Fig 3B) . Early TRM was lower for patients with pre-transplant NPA positive for rhinovirus (12%) as compared with patients with other VRI (34%) starting conditioning, although this did not reach significance (P = 0\u00c107). However, no differences were noted with patients with pre-HSCT negative NPA (100-day TRM 6%, P = 0\u00c13).

            "text": "Viral respiratory infections represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality after HSCT, because of the possible evolution to respiratory failure and the lack of effective therapeutic strategies available. Screening for respiratory viruses is not routinely performed in bone marrow transplant (BMT) Units and the presence of an URTI is not universally recognised as a risk factor that merits transplant delay. We extensively analysed the outcome of a sub-group of patients with a positive NPA screen before HSCT over a 10-year period. We found that pre-transplant viral infections had a profound impact on clinical outcomes, leading to lower OS and higher 100-day TRM, compared to patients that experienced a de novo viral infection after HSCT. Active viral infection at the time of transplant negatively influenced outcome of these patients who experienced respiratory infection-related mortality in almost 25% of cases. A significant proportion of children included in our cohort was affected by PID. These patients could be more susceptible to recurrent and difficult to eradicate viral RTI. However, this did not result in an increased prevalence of pre-HSCT VRI as compared to the literature. Indeed, Campbell et al (2015) reported a higher prevalence of pre-transplant positivity of respiratory virus screening, especially in children. However, in their study only a minority of patients were <18 years old (52/458, 11%). Of note, in this study, a higher mortality rate in children with pre-BMT viral infections was also reported, compared to adults. In our study, newly occurring VRIs were mainly documented in the early phase after HSCT and prevalence was comparable to the one recently described in children receiving HSCT (16\u00c16%) (Fisher et al, 2018) . Interestingly, in this study, early infections within the first 60 days after transplant were associated with higher morbidity and mortality, supporting the crucial impact of immune status for the outcome of patients with RVIs.",

This difference is unlikely to reflect a selection bias for better risk patients: when we looked at early TRM, progression to LRTI was the main cause of graft failure in the NPA+ group, and three other patients died due to pulmonary complications. Accordingly, risk factors analysis showed that a pre-transplant positive NPA was a major risk factor for early mortality. The more severe clinical course in patients with a respiratory virus documented in the upper airways before transplant could be related to the younger age of this subgroup of patients, given that age <2 years has been associated with dismal outcome of VRI (El Saleeby et al, 2008) .

            "text": "European guidelines only provide weak recommendations for postponing conditioning in case of VRI (Hirsch et al., 2013) (Peck et al, 2004) . Whether to postpone HSCT because of a positive NPA for rhinovirus is more debatable, since LRTI progression is not frequent. However, rhinovirus-associated lower airways infection before transplant can lead to a worsen outcome (Seo et al, 2017; Mowrer et al, 2018) . However, our data, although retrospective and limited to a small cohort of patients, show that pre-HSCT rhinovirus infection is associated with a modestly lower TRM as compared to other viral strains involved in URTI, and is overall comparable to that of patients with a negative NPA screen. When transplant delay is not feasible, strategies aimed to improve lymphocytes recovery in the first weeks after transplant [e.g. targeted in vivo T-cell depletion (Admiraal et al, 2017) , adoptive immunotherapy (Ciceri et al, 2009 )] should be considered. Faster immune reconstitution is usually expected when in vivo T-cell depletion is omitted or administered early during conditioning (Lindemans et al, 2014) . GvHD prophylaxis with alemtuzumab results in delayed lymphocytes recovery when compared to anti-thymocyte globulin (Shah et al, 2007) , and decisions regarding in vivo T-cell depletion strategy should balance the risk of GvHD versus the burden of active viral infections. Ex vivo manipulation of the graft, selectively depleting alloreactive cells and allowing the presence of gamma/delta T cells in the graft, can tackle post-transplant infections (Bertaina et al, 2014; Locatelli et al, 2017) , and turning-off T cell with an inducer of dimerization, have also been developed (Zhou et al, 2015) . Finally, non-myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens could limit organ toxicity and allow transplant also in patients with severe infections (i.e. PID patients), although the risk of engraftment failure with an active viral infection should be contemplated. However, prospective data are necessary to evaluate the impact of in vivo and ex vivo T-cell depletion on VRIs and no recommendation on the best strategy can be made.",

Nevertheless, in case of influenza or RSV infection, a delay of HSCT can allow pharmacological treatment (i.e. Oseltamivir and Ribavirin, respectively). Unfortunately, for most viruses there is no effective treatment available, and viral clearance is dependent on the efficacy of the host's immune system. Especially for patients with PID, that can more frequently present with chronic/refractory VRIs, balance of risk/benefit ratio is challenging because viral clearance is unlikely in SCID patients but can occur in the presence of a residual T cell immunity. Only one study reported the efficacy of transplant delay in 37 adults and children with RSV URTI before conditioning, showing that survival was significantly improved compared to those who encountered the virus after transplant",
