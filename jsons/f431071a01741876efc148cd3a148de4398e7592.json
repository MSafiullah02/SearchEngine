In IP, there is loss of, and damage to, colonic myenteric dopaminergic neurones. These, enteric plexus ganglia and physiologically related sympathetic neurones can contain Lewy bodies, as does the dorsal vagal nucleus [18] [19] [20] . Pfeiffer, thinking on similar but noninfective lines, homes in on constipation as a marker of the genesis of IP [20] . As a collateral hypothesis (Table 2) , we described the epidemiologic fit of Helicobacter infection to IP (including familial clusters, evidence for early acquisition, long prodrome and association with water source) and proposed an autoimmune basis [21] . By 2005, we had proof of principle that infection contributes to IP, through case studies of anti-Helicobacter therapy in gastritis, with and without associated Helicobacter [22] , and a hypothesis-testing study [23] . In essence, \"malignant\" IP appeared converted to \"benign\" following successful eradication, but marked deterioration accompanied failure. In cases of late IP, eradicating Helicobacter produced U-turns in both parkinsonism and cachexia [22] . In probands receiving no or only stable long-t 1 / 2 antiparkinsonian medication, the randomized efficacy study contrasted effect, on the time course of IP facets, of 1 week's successful anti-H. pylori therapy against placebo, and against failure [23] . Improvement in the primary outcome, mean stride length at free-walking speed, followed successful blinded active therapy (de-blinding being scheduled for 1 year post-randomization). Benefit on brady/hypokinesia did not fall off during the year after de-blinding, and was echoed in those given open-active anti-H. pylori therapy subsequent to placebo [23] . Improvement was irrespective of whether patients were yet receiving background antiparkinsonian medication. Figure 1 illustrates that gait can improve dramatically following H. pylori eradication therapy where biopsies are molecular microbiology positive but culture negative (and there is no evidence of SIBO or other infection) [24] . \"Low-density\" infection may be sufficient to perpetuate autoimmunity.
