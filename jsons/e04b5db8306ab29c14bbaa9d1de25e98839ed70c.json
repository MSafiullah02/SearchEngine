The full spectrum of Covid-19 ranges from mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death. [1] [2] [3] [4] Thus far, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. After the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, screening of approved drugs identified lopinavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor, as having in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, the virus that causes SARS in humans. [5] [6] [7] Ritonavir is combined with lopinavir to increase its plasma halflife through the inhibition of cytochrome P450. An open-label study published in 2004 suggested, by comparison with a historical control group that received only ribavirin, that the addition of lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) to ribavirin reduced the risk of adverse clinical outcomes (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] or death) as well as viral load among patients with SARS. 5 However, the lack of randomization and a contemporary control group and the concomitant use of glucocorticoids and ribavirin in that study made the effect of lopinavir-ritonavir difficult to assess. Similarly, lopinavir has activity, both in vitro 8 and in an animal model, 9 against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and case reports have suggested that the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin and interferon alfa resulted in virologic clearance and survival. [10] [11] [12] However, because convincing data about the efficacy of this approach in humans are lacking, 12 a clinical trial (with recombinant interferon beta-1b) for MERS is currently under way (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02845843). [13] [14] [15] To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral lopinavir-ritonavir for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial, LOTUS China (Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China), in adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 350, "end": 353, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 354, "end": 357, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 358, "end": 361, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 362, "end": 365, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 737, "end": 740, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 741, "end": 744, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1163, "text": "[ARDS]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1726, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1731, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1732, "end": 1736, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1965, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1970, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1975, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Patients were assessed for eligibility on the basis of a positive reverse-transcriptase-polymerasechain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tec or Sansure Biotech) for SARS-CoV-2 in a respiratory tract sample tested by the local Center for Disease Control (CDC) or by a designated diagnostic laboratory.

Samples were taken only intermittently (on days 1, 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28), and more frequent sam- * Clinical improvement was defined as a decline of two categories on the modified seven-category ordinal scale of clinical status, or hospital discharge. ICU denotes intensive care unit. \u2020 Differences were expressed as rate differences or median differences (Hodges-Lehmann estimate) and 95% confidence intervals. \u2021 The hazard ratio for clinical improvement was estimated by Cox proportional-risk model. \u00a7 This total includes 3 patients who died within 24 hours after randomization and did not receive lopinavir-ritonavir.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "T h e ne w e ngl a nd jou r na l o f m e dicine pling in the first 5 days could have provided more detailed characterization of viral load kinetics in the two groups over this critical period. In addition, previous studies have shown that throat-swab specimens have lower viral loads than nasopharyngeal samples, 25 and importantly, we were unable to do sampling of lower respiratory tract secretions. Of note, depending on cell type used, the 50% effective concentrations (EC 50 ) of lopinavir in vitro for SARS-CoV has ranged from 4.0 to 10.7 \u03bcg per milliliter, 5, 6, 8 although other studies reported that lopinavir was inactive 26 or that higher concentrations (25 \u03bcg per milliliter) were required for inhibition. 7 For MERS-CoV, the EC 50 values have ranged from 5 to approximately 7 \u03bcg per milliliter). 1, 8, 13 Both the mean peak (9.6 \u03bcg per milliliter) and trough (5.5 \u03bcg per milliliter) serum concentrations of lopinavir in adults just approach these concentrations. Whether the EC 50 value is an adequate threshold and whether unbound lopinavir concentrations in human plasma are sufficient for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 are questionable. 1 Nearly 14% of lopinavir-ritonavir recipients were unable to complete the full 14-day course of administration. This was due primarily to gastrointestinal adverse events, including anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea, as well as two serious adverse events, both acute gastritis. Two recipients had self-limited skin eruptions. Such side effects, including the risks of hepatic injury, pancreatitis, more severe cutaneous eruptions, and QT prolongation, and the potential for multiple drug interactions due to CYP3A inhibition, are well documented with this drug combination. The side-effect profile observed in the current trial arouses concern about the use of higher or more prolonged lopinavir-ritonavir dose regimens in efforts to improve outcomes. Our trial has several limitations. In particular, the trial was not blinded, so it is possible that knowledge of the treatment assignment might have influenced clinical decision-making that could have affected the ordinal scale measurements we used. We will continue to follow these patients to evaluate their long-term prognosis. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were generally balanced across the two groups, but the somewhat higher throat viral loads in the lopinavir-ritonavir group raise the possibility that this group had more viral replication. Although we did not observe differences between groups in the frequency of use of concurrent pharmacologic interventions, such as glucocorticoids, this might have been another confounder. In addition, approximately 45% and 40% of the patients in lopinavir-ritonavir group had positive RNA detection by throat swabs on day 14 and day 28, respectively, but we do not know if infectious virus was still present, since we did not attempt virus isolation or assess the possible emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir. Finally, we do not have data on the lopinavir exposure levels in these seriously and often critically ill patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 564, "end": 566, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 567, "end": 569, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 809, "end": 811, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 812, "end": 814, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we found that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious Covid-19.

Results less than the lower limit of quantification of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay and greater than the limit of qualitative detection are imputed with 1 log 10 copies per milliliter; results for patients with viral-negative RNA are imputed with 0 log 10 copies per milliliter. Among the 199 patients, 130 (59 patients in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and 71 in the standard-care group) had virologic data that were used for viral load calculation, whereas the rest of the patients had undetectable viral RNA on throat swabs over the time. * Adverse events that occurred in more than 1 patient after randomization through day 28 are shown. Some patients had more than one adverse event. Since there are no adverse event grades criteria for serum levels of hypersensitivity troponin (cardiac biomarker) and serum lipid, the proportions of patients with values worse than baseline values are listed here. The proportion of increased hypersensitivity troponin was higher in the standard-care group than in the lopinavir-ritonavir group (14.1% vs. 9.5%). A total of 55 patients (52.4%) in the standard-care group and 65 (68.4%) in the lopinavir-ritonavir group had lipid levels that were normal at enrollment but abnormal after enrollment.
