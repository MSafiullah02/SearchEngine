According to WHO guidance, corticosteroids are not recommended to be used routinely for patients with severe acute respiratory infection when 2019-nCoV infection is suspected, unless indicated for another reason [1]. In spite of this, from the point of urgently clinical demand, Chinese Thoracic Society (CTS) proposed an expert consensus statement that suggests taking a prudent attitude of corticosteroids usage [2]. The following criteria should be considered [3]: (1) the benefits and harms should be carefully weighed before using corticosteroids; (2) corticosteroids should be used prudently on critically ill patients; (3) for patients with hypoxemia due to underlying diseases or who use corticosteroids for chronic diseases on a regular basis, further use of corticosteroids should be cautious; (4) the dosage should be low to moderate (\u2264 0\u00b75\u20131 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone or equivalent) and the duration should be short (\u2264 7 days).",

My colleagues and I did not use corticosteroids routinely. A total of 92 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were treated in our ward. Among them, low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids were only given to seven patients prudently at different stages in the disease course. Most of them showed favorable response to corticosteroid treatment with improvement of clinical syndromes and HRCT findings.

The main potential risks associated with corticosteroids usage include secondary infections, long-term complications, and delayed virus clearance. In addition, the administration of corticosteroids did not show an advantage to decrease mortality [7], plus, patients receiving corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy and stay in intensive care unit (ICU) longer [6].",

Among them, 11% of patients worsened in 1~2 weeks and died of multiple organ failure. In our cases, patient 1 was admitted on the fifth day from onset. The disease course and chest HRCT abnormalities progressed rapidly. A study reported that the pathological findings of COVID-19 were interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrating, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation, suggesting early phase of ARDS. So, timely and appropriate use of corticosteroids could be considered to attenuate cytokine-related lung injury and prevent ARDS development [12]. For patient 2, when he was transferred to our hospital, the clinical course was exceeding 20 days and HRCT showed a prominent consolidation with bilateral involvement. The clinical characteristics, disease course, and radiological findings demonstrated a subacute process, resembling secondary organizing pneumonia (SOP) [13]. The total durance of corticosteroids was 25 days and he showed a favorable response to corticosteroid treatment. However, is the treatment durance appropriate? Do such \u201corganizing pneumonia\u201d-like abnormalities in HRCT progress or relapse after corticosteroids discontinued? What extent or degree will the interstitial abnormalities be left in the lung? How long will it take for lung functions to recover? All these clinical questions remain our concerns. A long-term follow up is indeed needed to monitor the serial pulmonary functions and HRCT appearances.",

Pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes released a considerable amount of interleukin 6, which was associated with the severity and outcome of the disease and was therefore believed to play a major role in inciting the cytokine storm [15, 16]. Xu and his colleagues reported 21 cases diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 that were treated effectively with tocilizumab, IL-6 receptor antagonist. After being given tocilizumab, the clinical manifestations, HRCT abnormalities, and laboratory examinations remarkably improved and most of the patients were discharged within 2 weeks with no notable adverse reactions observed [17]. Although the evidence came from a single center and the sample size was small, targeting inflammatory signaling pathway is a potential consideration in the treatment of COVID-19 [18]. However, Radbel J et al. reported two patients progressed to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) despite tocilizumab usage and one developed viral myocarditis [19]. Further randomized controlled trials are still needed to confirm the efficacy and safety and to select patients who could benefit from the treatment of cytokine inhibitors the most.",

To reduce the mortality rate, an early warning model must be established to identify severe individuals who are at risk of becoming critically ill. As mentioned in previous studies, older age, a history of cerebrovascular disease, and ARDS were associated with increased risk of death [11, 20, 21]. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was associated with death of COVID-19, highlighting the significance of supportive care of organ functions [10, 22]. Lymphocytopenia was also common in critically ill patients with viral infection [23, 24], and careful monitoring of lab examinations is necessary. Other reported biomarkers including PD-1, CTLA4, TIGIT, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-2, which were associated with functional T-cells, were demonstrated to predict progression of COVID-19 [25]. In addition, because fever was not detected during the onset of some patients [26], early or repeated radiological examinations are most important for screening patients with COVID-19 and evaluating disease progression.",

In accordance with CTS expert consensus [2], we suggest the use of low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids for short courses with caution. Personalized strategy should be rational, and the decision of initiating corticosteroid treatment should be based on the judgment of clinical courses, lab findings, radiological appearances, and, if available, pathological examinations. In addition, it is necessary to detect the associated complications and reexamine chest HRCT in short intervals (within 1 week) to assess treatment response. A well-designed random controlled study which stratifies patients with disease severity is still needed to treat the disease efficaciously.",
