It is transmitted from person to person who are in close contact (within about 1.8 meters). Furthermore, it is possible that the virus transmits by touching a surface or an object that has virus-containing respiratory droplets, and then touching the eyes, mouth or nose.2 3 This mode of transmission may be important as coronavirus has been isolated from surfaces several days from dissemination.4\n",

Using a printed chart and measuring the symbol size may control for hardware and software variations. This information is sufficient for treatment decisions for older children who are being treated for amblyopia. Parents can be instructed to perform basic eye movement examination and send a simple video, or use dedicated computer or phone applications, assisting with poststrabismus surgery examinations and other ocular movement disorders. Unfortunately, examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye requires either a professional or an expensive imaging instrument. The use of web-based refraction systems on paediatric patients is unreliable at this point due to calibration and validation issues. The presence of a good red reflex with good visual acuity and alignment may suffice to screen most healthy children until full examination is possible.",

Cortiula and colleagues70 stated that patients with advanced disease and no suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 should keep receiving planned chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment, without unnecessary delays. Moreover, they highlighted that although postponing follow-up and cancer prevention appointments is a strategy to be considered, an excessive accumulation of visits or examinations risks burdening the national public health system over the next few months.
