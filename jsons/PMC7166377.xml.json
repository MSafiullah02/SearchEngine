Rapid identification of the viral cause of acute respiratory infection has consequences for patient monitoring and care, including hospital admission or discharge, administration of antibiotics and antiviral therapy, and reduction of diagnosis investigation [Adcock et al., 1997; Barenfanger et al., 2000]. Antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IF) or immunochromatography is the usual first\u2010line diagnostic approach, although it lacks sensitivity [Steininger et al., 2002; Louie et al., 2010]. An alternative is to test for viral genomes by molecular means. Although various in\u2010house and commercial assays are available, first\u2010line molecular detection is rarely routinely practiced, either because of high cost (commercial assays) or because few assays are multiplex and have short turnaround times [Bellau\u2010Pujol et al., 2005; Gunson et al., 2005; Kuypers et al., 2006; Bonroy et al., 2007; van de Pol et al., 2007; Brittain\u2010Long et al., 2008].",

            "text": "The detection of RSV infection in infants under 6 weeks old, or presenting with a medical condition such as prematurity or underlying cardiopulmonary disease, leads to hospital admission to monitor the risk of rapid respiratory aggravation or apnea [Hall, 2000; Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010]. Also, children with influenza often present with alarming neurological symptoms associated with respiratory disease, but will not need further neurological investigation if influenza virus is detected rapidly [2009b]. Similarly, if a viral infection is diagnosed in a newborn with isolated fever, investigations for neonatal bacterial infection can be limited. Moreover, early administration of neuraminidase inhibitors in cases of influenza may prevent severe forms of infection, as reported during the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic [2009a,c]. Finally, when RSV and influenza viruses co\u2010circulate at an epidemic rate (as was the case in 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010), it may not be possible to distinguish infection by one virus from that by the other on the basis of clinical presentation [Bosis et al., 2008; Bourgeois et al., 2009]. Thus, rapid and sensitive tools are needed specifically to detect influenza and RSV infections, and to identify mixed infections. The diagnostic value of rapid antigen detection tests for influenza and RSV infections remains a subject of debate: Although technically well adapted to the management of acute respiratory infections, the currently available tests lack sensitivity and specificity [Steininger et al., 2002; Louie et al., 2010].",

The higher sensitivity of RT\u2010PCR compared to antigen detection prompted us to use this technology to develop an inexpensive (<10.00\u20ac/test), rapid (<4 hr), specific and sensitive assay, targeting the genomes of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. Triplex RT\u2010PCR is cheaper and faster than three simplex assays. To facilitate use in daily practice, the procedure was simplified by adapting the extraction step to the MagNA Pure Compact system (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France), and the assay was successfully transferred to a different laboratory setting, where a different real\u2010time PCR thermocycler was used (ABI PRISM\u00ae 7500 Real Time PCR System \u2013 Applera). Although not to be compared to rapid antigen testing, the assay was efficient enough to provide clinicians with specific and sensitive results daily: For samples made available at 13:00, the results were returned by 16:30.",

Its ability to detect various strains of viruses was assessed with a panel of viruses isolated in cell\u2010culture. With this panel, the sensitivity and efficiency of the triplex RT\u2010PCR were found to be slightly lower than those obtained with the equivalent simplex assays, although the difference was not significant (results not shown), as previously reported by others for multiplex RT\u2010PCR [Bonroy et al., 2007]. However, the sensitivity and efficiency of the assay were suitable for diagnosis. Indeed, the results were concordant for 100% of the 75 samples found positive with commercial RT\u2010PCR assays, and the triplex assay successfully detected mixed infections. The 7900HT thermocycler allows no more than three different fluorescent dyes in real\u2010time PCR assays, so the triplex assay could not also include an internal control. However, no PCR inhibitors were detected in 132 samples tested by the Argene method, indicating that the risk of missing a positive sample was small. If necessary for routine diagnosis, an internal control could be added to the sample prior to extraction, and the corresponding control RT\u2010PCR could then be performed in parallel during the same run. The results obtained with this assay in daily practice during the 2008\u20132009 and 2009\u20132010 seasons were consistent with the data provided by the national influenza\u2010monitoring network of GPs and pediatricians GROG (Groupes R\u00e9gionaux d'Observation de la Grippe \u2013 Regional Influenza Surveillance Group; http://www.grog.org/), and by the National Influenza Centre (Northern France), indicating, in particular, that circulation of influenza B was sporadic or absent in France during the periods studied. As previously described [Bourgeois et al., 2009], RSV infection was more frequent than influenza in young children, as evidenced by the higher percentage of RSV\u2010positive specimens, even during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemics. Finally, the availability of a molecular tool allowing to distinguish rapidly influenza A from RSV in two general hospital settings in the context of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemics was of utmost value.",
