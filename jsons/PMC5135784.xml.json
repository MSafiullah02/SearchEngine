Pharmacological administration of pyruvate is able to improve organ function in animal models of oxidant-mediated cellular injury [1, 2]; however, pyruvate is unstable in aqueous solutions and this certainly limits its therapeutic potential. EP, a simple derivative of pyruvic acid, is also an ROS scavenger, but exerts pharmacological effects, such as the anti-inflammatory effects, which are quite distinct from those exerted by pyruvate anion [1, 2]. Treatment with EP has been shown to improve survival and/or ameliorate multiple organ dysfunctions in a wide variety of preclinical models of critical illnesses [1, 2]. Up to date, about 340 EP related papers have been published; about 100 new papers published after 2010 have not been summarized and reviewed. This review focuses on how EP is able to ameliorate inflammatory injures of multiple vital organs and summarizes new findings from recently published EP investigations.",

EP treatment [EP source in this review was all from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. EP dissolved in commercially available Ringer\u2019s lactate solution (RLS). Commercially available RLS was used as the control solution. EP (40 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected every 6 h for 48 h)] significantly ameliorates pancreatic injury and necrosis [4, 6]; EP therapy also markedly reduces pancreatic expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, HMGB1 and NF-kB DNA binding [4, 6]; treatment with EP reduces the number of inflammatory cell infiltration and decreases the pancreatic level of lipid peroxidation, which is a parameter of ROS [4]. Because early inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6), late inflammatory mediator HMGB1 and ROS play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SAP [4, 6, 10, 11], and EP can reduce the levels of these inflammatory cytokines and scavenge ROS. Therefore, EP may attenuate pancreatic injury during SAP.",

            "text": "About 20\u201330% of all acute pancreatitis patients develop SAP in clinical practice, and the mortality rate in SAP is 20\u201330% [3]. SAP starts as a local inflammation of pancreatic tissue that induces the development of multiple extrapancreatic organs dysfunction [6, 8]. During SAP, the concentrations of both early (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and late inflammatory cytokines are significantly increased [6, 10\u201313], these cytokines play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SAP [6, 12]. The late inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 is particularly important because extracellular HMGB1 can aggravate the pancreatic inflammatory process [14] and HMGB1 can also contribute to multiple distant organ injuries in the following experimental models as well: HMGB1 contributes to liver injury in ischemia-reperfusion [15]. Exogenous HMGB1 injection is able to induce liver injury in normal mice [16]. HMGB1 impairs hepatocyte regeneration during acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and blockade of HMGB1 improves hepatocyte regeneration in acetaminophen overdose-induced fatal liver injury [17]. Anti-HMGB1 treatment protects against APAP hepatotoxicity in rats [18]. HMGB1 also contributes to renal ischemia reperfusion injury [19], sepsis-induced kidney injury [20] and severe acute pancreatitis related kidney injury [21]. HMGB1 is also found to significantly contribute to hemorrhagic shock related acute lung injury (ALI) [22]; hypoxia-induced ALI [23] and severe acute pancreatitis related ALI [24]. HMGB1 is also an important factor that not only significantly contributes to gut mucosal injury [16], but also mediates gut bacterial translocation (BT) [25], and blockade of HMGB1 can even prevent gut BT [25]. Gut mucosal injury and intestinal BT in SAP is particularly important because the intestine is the biggest reservoir of bacteria in the body and leakage of bacteria or microbial products, notably LPS, from the lumen of the gut into the systemic circulation, which drives the development of systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in experimental models [26]. SAP frequently induces gut barrier dysfunction [6, 9, 27, 28]. The small intestine becomes damaged by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion during SAP [29, 30], and the failure of gut barrier is associated with BT [29], which is evident in SAP [6, 27, 28, 31]. SAP patients have significantly increased serum LPS [32], 68.8% of the SAP patients have bacteraemia and these bacteria are highly likely gut-derived opportunistic pathogens [27]. Furthermore, BT and infected pancreatic necrosis in acute necrotizing pancreatitis derive from small bowel rather than from the colon [28]. BT and/or gut derived LPS play a critical role in the development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and MODS during SAP [29, 33], because BT not only contributes to pancreatic infection [28, 33], but also induces/triggers SIRS/sepsis in critical illness [33, 34]. The profound SIRS/sepsis can lead to MODS and mortality in SAP [9, 29, 31, 33], this is one of the underlying mechanisms that AP frequently affects extrapancreatic organs [6, 25], and the incidence of MODS in SAP is not available but certainly higher than the 20\u201330% of mortality rate in SAP [3]. Systemic inflammation with multi-organ dysfunction is the cause of death in a murine ligation-induced SAP, and SIRS and MODS can lead to the preponderance of mortality (75%) in this lethal SAP model [9] while bile duct ligation does not have mortality, even though obstructive jaundice is prone to sepsis [9]. Therefore, the gut is thought to act as the starter of SIRS [29] and HMGB1 may be an important factor that links gut barrier dysfunction and MODS during SAP. EP (40 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected every 6 h for 48 h) can ameliorate SAP related multiple organ injuries [6, 10, 11] at least partly because EP not only reduces the inflammation in these organs [6, 10, 11], but also inhibits nearly 90% of the hepatic tissue HMGB1 to release [12] and other related cells to release HMGB1 [10, 12], thereby decreases the circulating HMGB1 level in SAP [10, 14]. Thus, HMGB1 is an important factor that not only directly contributes to multiple organ injuries, but also mediates gut BT to trigger/induce systemic inflammation/sepsis, the latter can lead to MODS. Currently, the circulating HMGB1 level is thought to be reliable to predict the severity of SAP [10, 14], this is likely because HMGB1 is linked to multiple organ injuries during SAP [10, 12, 14], the liver is an important source of circulating HMGB1 [12], and the circulating HMGB1 level could reflect the severity of liver injury, which is one of the important parameters for diagnosing SAP [6, 12]. SAP associated BT was reduced by 90% following EP treatment [6] breaking the link between BT and MODS. Therefore, EP could be a better treatment option against SAP related multiple organ injuries in experimental models [6, 10, 11].",

In addition, EP treatment increases NF-kB DNA binding, which often modulates inflammation when hepatic necrosis is not evident [37] but modulates regeneration when hepatic necrosis is evident [38], this concept has been proved in acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in which massive hepatocyte necrosis is a predominant feature [39, 40]. Therefore, it is likely that EP enhances NF-kB DNA binding to improve hepatocyte regeneration in obstructive jaundice.",

In a lethal experimental SAP murine model, SAP induces significantly increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, NF-kB activation, hepatic expression of transcripts for TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 [12]. SAP also induces focal hepatocyte necrosis and a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration [6, 12, 13], all of these changes can be significantly decreased by delayed treatment with EP instead of Ringers lactate solution [12].

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI), also addressed as mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (MARDS), is a significant health problem associated with high mortalities [8, 48]; MARDS is also a severe complication and a major feature of MODS to SAP [8]. In patients with AP, up to 20% of all deaths occur prior to admission to hospitals, and MARDS is the predominant cause of death in these cases [48]. In SAP, the MARDS is the main contributing factor to early deaths, i.e. within the first week after admission [49]. The inflammatory mediators and the profound SIRS are thought to play a key role in the development of MARDS [3, 50, 51] because the significantly increased serum inflammatory mediators activate alveolar macrophages to release chemotactic mediators that play an important role in recruiting neutrophils, which work together with the elevated circulating pro-inflammatory mediators to severely damage alveolar epithelium and microvascular endothelium, and resultantly causes the increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier and pulmonary edema. This theory is supported by the following evidence in which the alveolar-capillary barrier is severely injured and the pulmonary permeability is significantly increased in an experimental acute necrotizing pancreatitis [6]. The anti-inflammatory agent EP (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally injected every 6 h for 48 h) markedly decreases the lung permeability and alleviates pulmonary edema at least partly by reducing pulmonary inflammation and neutrophils infiltration in a couple of experimental SAP models with acute lung injury [6, 10, 52, 53]. Increased local and systemic levels of IL-6 are associated with inflammatory process, including neutrophil infiltration of the alveolar space, resulting in lung injury [54]. EP treatment reduces the IL-6-induced release of IL-8 and decreases IL-6-induced neutrophil adhesion to the lung epithelial cells [54], and this anti-inflammatory effect is via Akt and NF-kB p65 pathway [55]. Therefore, EP reduces secretory and adhesive potential of lung epithelial cells under inflammatory conditions [54, 55].",

LPS stimulates macrophages to release HMGB1 and up-regulates iNOS expression, EP treatment (cells were incubated with 25 mM EP for 24 h) can reverse these effects by inducing heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) via a p38 MAKP- and NRF2-dependent pathway [60]. HMGB1 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that can be actively secreted by immunocompetent cells, including monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils, and this highly conservative nuclear protein is an important late inflammatory mediator in sepsis [61]. HMGB1 can also be passively released by dying cells or necrotic tissue [25]. HMGB1 plays an important role in modulating inflammatory cascade in activated macrophages: HMGB1 stimulates macrophages to release TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, while HMGB1neutralizing antibody can block TNF-\u03b1 release [62, 63] and knocking-out HMGB1 receptor can reverse IL-6 release [63]. In macrophages cultures, LPS stimulates macrophages to release high concentrations of early inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1 and the late mediator HMGB1 [61\u201363], and EP treatment reduces these changes by specifically inhibiting the activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and NF-kB, two signalling pathways that are critical for cytokines release [61].",

Delayed treatment with EP (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally injected 24 h, 30 h, 48 h, and 54 h after cecal puncture, the experiment finished 120 h after cecal puncture) significantly increases survival and markedly reduces circulating levels of HMGB1 in mice with sepsis [61]. EP increases survival and decreases serum HMGB1 by up-regulation of HO-1 level in septic animals [60]. In an established septic animal model, sepsis induces significantly increased plasma TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1; sepsis also increases hepatic lactate, lactate/pyruvate levels and down-regulates hepatic ATP and energy charge levels; all of these effects can be reversed in the septic mice treated with a single dose of EP (40 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection, and the liver samples were taken 6 h after EP injection), suggesting that EP protects against sepsis by regulating energy metabolism and inhibiting systemic inflammation [64]. In addition, EP improves sepsis outcome by reducing mitochondrial swelling and dysfunction in experimental sepsis [65]. Septic patients have significantly increased serum HMGB1 levels, which can induce endothelial cell hyperpermeability via BAX and BCL-2 regulated apoptosis, EP can reverse these detrimental effects to prevent endothelial cell injury in experimental sepsis [66]. Furthermore, EP can effectively reduce vascular endothelial inflammation and this effect at least partly depends on the attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum stress [67].",

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause brain cell death/dying, and the/dead/dying cells can release nuclear protein HMGB1 that can activate inflammatory pathways, therefore, the HMGB1 inhibitor EP (75 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected at 5 min, 1 h, 6 h after brain injury, and brain samples were harvested 24 h after brain injury) significantly decreases the expressions of HMGB1, TLR4, NF-kB DNA binding and inflammatory mediators, such as, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6. EP treatment also ameliorates beam walking performance, brain edema and cortical apoptotic cell death, suggesting that the protective effects of EP maybe mediated by the reduction of HMGB1/TLR4/NF-kB-mediated inflammatory response in the injured rat brain [77]. Many TBI survivors sustain neurological disability and cognitive impairment due to the lack of defined therapy to reduce TBI-induced long-term brain damage, EP (40 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected at 15 min, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h after brain injury, and brain samples were taken 28 days after brain injury) confers long-term neuroprotection against TBI, possibly via breaking the vicious cycle among matrix metalloproteinase-9-mediated blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation and long-lasting brain damage [78]. Experimental TBI is known to produce an acute increase in cerebral glucose utilization, followed rapidly by a generalized cerebral metabolic depression. Early administration of EP (40 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected at 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h after brain injury, and brain samples were harvested 24 after brain injury) enhances cerebral glucose metabolism and neuronal survival, therefore, EP therapy is able to attenuate cerebral metabolic depression and neuronal loss after traumatic brain injury [79].",

EP also protects neurons from haemoglobin-induced cell death in vitro and neuronal cell degeneration in ICH mice. EP exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibiting microglia activation, NF-kB activation and decreasing TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 production. These results indicate that EP protects ICH induced brain damage via anti-cell death and anti-inflammatory actions [80]. In another rat ICH model, EP treatment (40 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected at 1 h, 6 h and 12 h after the induction of ICH, and brain samples were harvested 72 h after the induction of ICH) significantly reduces inflammatory cell infiltration and expression of IL-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the perihematoma after ICH. EP therapy also shows less brain edema, less haemorrhage and greater neurobehavioral function. The results suggest that EP ameliorates inflammatory damage after ICH via HMGB1-RAGE signalling pathway [81].",

The low-cost EP (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally injected twice a day for 3 weeks) elicits a potent immune-based antitumor response through inhibition of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), a key tolerogenic enzyme for many human tumors [88]. EP treatment (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally injected once a day for 2 weeks) inhibits tumor angiogenesis by inhibition of the NF-kB signalling pathway [89]. HMGB1 and RAGE are significantly expressed in gastric adenocarcinoma, and EP treatment (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg intraperitoneally injected once a day for 2 weeks) inhibits gastric cancer growth via regulation of the HMGB1-RAGE and Akt pathways [90]. EP administration (cultured cancer cells were treated with EP at 10 mM and 20 mM for up to 120 h) also inhibits growth and invasion of gallbladder cancer cells via down-regulation of the HMGB1-RAGE axis [91]. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in response to chronic hepatic injury. Although p53 is usually regarded as a tumor suppressor, its constant activation can promote pro-tumorigenic inflammation, at least in part, via inducing HMGB1 release. EP administration (40 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected once every other day for 7 weeks) prevents tumorigenesis in rat livers by restoring p53, and EP treatment does not affect p53-mediated hepatic apoptosis [92]. Furthermore, EP treatment (Cultured cancer cells were treated with 10 mM, 20 mM EP up to 72 h) induces apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in G phase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [93]. In addition, EP treatment (Cultured cancer cells were treated with 10 mM, 20 mM, 40 mM EP up to 120 h) defangs some malignancy-associated properties of prostate cancer cells including proliferation, invasion and anchorage-independent growth [94]. Taken together, EP may have a potential as a new multi-functional compound for cancer therapy.",

EP also interacts with NF-kB subunits, Rel A and p50 to inhibit their functions at multiple points, for example, EP is able to inhibit the nuclear association of Rel A after TNF-\u03b1 treatment [96]. At least some of the anti-inflammatory effects EP are related to its ability to scavenge ROS, since EP is an anti-oxidant [1, 2, 12], and oxidative stress is able to activate NF-kB-dependent gene transcription [1, 2, 12]. EP not only prevents nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of HMGB1 [95], but also inhibits cytoplasmic HMGB1 to be released extracellularly [12]. Moreover, EP inhibits HMGB1 release from primary microglial cells via direct intracellular Ca (2+) chelation [97], and EP also regulates inflammation and exerts a neuroprotective effect via dual functions, chelating intracellular Zn (2+) and promoting NAD replenishment [98].",
