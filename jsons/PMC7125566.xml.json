            "text": "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a small non-enveloped virus that contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 7.7 kb (Clarke et al., 2012). FCV belongs to the Caliciviridae, a family of viruses that includes important pathogens of humans and animals such as noroviruses, sapoviruses, vesicular exanthema swine virus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (Green, 2007, Pesavento et al., 2008). There are at least six genera in Caliciviridae: Norovirus, Sapovirus, Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Nebovirus and Recovirus (Clarke et al., 2012). Genera Norovirus and Sapovirus contain human caliciviruses that are the major causes of viral gastroenteritis (Green, 2007). FCV belongs to the genus Vesivirus and is a highly important infectious pathogen of cats. FCV causes acute, self-limiting oral and upper respiratory tract disease or lameness but chronic infection also occurs often. In recent years, virulent, systemic FCV (vs-FCV) strains that cause severe systemic diseases with a high mortality of up to 67% were reported in the US and the EU (Foley et al., 2006, Pesavento et al., 2008). FCV vaccines are available for cats but the antigenic diversity of FCV strains and short-living immunity limits the efficacy of vaccines. In addition, symptomatic or non-symptomatic carriers pose a continuous challenge to the control of FCV infection. Therefore the development of effective therapeutic agents for various FCV strains is expected to provide significant benefit to the management and control of FCV infection in cats.",

            "text": "FCV genome has three open reading frames (ORFs) 1, 2 and 3 (Pesavento et al., 2008). Viral polyproteins consisting of non-structural proteins, such as viral 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and viral polymerase, are produced from ORF1 and processed by 3CLpro into functional mature proteins. A capsid precursor is translated from ORF2 and subsequently cleaved by viral 3CLpro into the major capsid protein (VP1) and the leader protein of the capsid (Sosnovtsev et al., 1998). The ORF3 encodes the minor structural protein (VP2), which interacts with VP1 to form the capsid and is associated with RNA genome packaging (Sosnovtsev et al., 2005). FCV capsid is composed of 180 copies of VP1 and only a few copies of VP2 (Prasad et al., 1994, Sosnovtsev and Green, 2000). The VP1 is composed of S, P1 and P2 subdomain (Pesavento et al., 2008, Sosnovtsev et al., 1998) and the P2 subdomain is involved in antigenicity and receptor interactions (Bhella and Goodfellow, 2011, Ossiboff et al., 2010). The process of cell entry by FCV and other non-enveloped virus is generally not well understood, but viral binding to the cellular receptor is believed to trigger a conformational change in the capsid leading to capsid disassembly and release of its contents for replication (Bhella et al., 2008, Johnson, 2010). Recently, virus entry has become one of the targets for therapeutic intervention, but only a few small molecule inhibitors targeting the virus capsid have been reported for non-enveloped viruses including picornaviruses (Buontempo et al., 1997, De Palma et al., 2008, Ho et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2017, Romero, 2001, Thys et al., 2008, Tijsma et al., 2014, Torres-Torres et al., 2015).",

The infected cells were freeze-thawed three times and virus titers were determined by the standard TCID50 method with the 10-fold dilution of each sample (Reed and Muench, 1938). The EC50 of each compound was calculated by nonlinear regression analyses of dose-dependent curves of virus titers against log inhibitor concentrations (variable slope) using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA). At least 2 independent samples were used for determining EC50 values.",

The A539T substitution in P4 FCV is located in the P2 subdomain of VP1 (Fig. 4\nA). The alanine at amino acid position 539 in the VP1 is highly conserved among FCV VP1 sequences reported in GenBank (270 strains) and comprises 82.2% of FCV VP1 sequences, followed by valine (14.4%) and proline (3.3%) (Fig. 4A). However, none of FCV VP1 sequences was reported to have threonine at that position. The T138S substitution in FCV P12 3CLpro is located in the C-terminal domain near the active site (Fig. 4B).

The effects of FXR in modulating metabolism and increasing energy expenditure on food intake has suggested the potential use of fexaramine in treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance (Fang et al., 2015). The effects of FXR agonists in lipid metabolism have also shown to play a role in the replication of viruses that requires close interaction with lipid contents (Honke et al., 2017, Kim and Chang, 2012, Radreau et al., 2016). We previously reported that FXR agonists including bile acids and fexaramine inhibit the replication of rotavirus and their inhibitory effects are mediated by reduction of cellular lipid contents by the activation of FXR (Kim and Chang, 2012). In this study, we demonstrated that the replication of FCV is potently inhibited by fexaramine in cell culture. Interestingly, investigation on the mode of FCV inhibition by fexaramine by various experiments including the time-of-addition studies and analysis of viral resistance showed that, in contrast with inhibition of rotavirus (Kim and Chang, 2012), fexaramine acts as an entry inhibitor of FCV. Virus entry inhibitors have been developed or reported for enveloped viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Haqqani and Tilton, 2013, Woollard and Kanmogne, 2015), influenza virus (Palese and Shaw, 2007), Measles virus (Plemper et al., 2005) and Dengue virus (Scaturro et al., 2014). Virus entry inhibitors have also been reported for non-enveloped viruses including picornaviruses including poliovirus (Thys et al., 2008), enterovirus (Buontempo et al., 1997, Ho et al., 2016, Ma et al., 2017, Torres-Torres et al., 2015) and rhinoviruses (De Palma et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2017, Tijsma et al., 2014). However, entry inhibitors of any calicivirus have not been reported and this is the first report on a small molecule entry inhibitor of feline calicivirus. We also tested fexaramine against murine norovirus and porcine enteric calicivirus (sapovirus) in a preliminary study but it had minimal inhibitory activity at up to 10 \u03bcM in cell culture against those viruses (data not shown).",

It is of note that fexaramine has a low genetic barrier to resistance as fexaramine-resistant viruses were readily obtained within 3\u20135 serial passages (Fig. 3). This was in contrast to the case with NPI52 against FCV where NPI52-resistant viruses were obtained at later viral passages and the decrease in drug susceptibility was of less magnitude compared to fexaramine (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "Our analysis of fexaramine-resistant FCV showed that a single mutation in VP1 (A539T) confers viral resistance to fexaramine. The alanine at the 539 site of the P2 subdomain of VP1 is located in the surface-exposed loop of the P2 subdomain of VP1 and is highly conserved among FCV field strains (Fig. 4A). The A539T mutation in fexaramine-resistant virus sits adjacent to a mutation (I535V) that was previously identified in some FCV mutants conferring resistance to the soluble ectodomain of the FCV receptor (Ossiboff et al., 2010), feline functional adhesion molecule A (fJAM-A) (Makino et al., 2006, Ossiboff and Parker, 2007). Analysis of resistant mutants generated by soluble fJAM-A suggested that binding of FCV to fJAM leads to conformational change of FCV VP1 (Ossiboff et al., 2010), and the binding and subsequent conformation changes seem to be mediated by residues located in the surface-exposed or hidden regions in VP1, including the P2 subdomain, respectively (Ossiboff et al., 2010). Other non-enveloped viruses, such as human rhinoviruses (HRVs), are reported to undergo conformational changes of virus capsids during virus entry, and inhibition of capsid conformational changes by a small molecule inhibitor was reported for HRV and other enteroviruses. Pleconaril, an entry inhibitor, binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the VP1 of HRV, inducing conformational changes that lead to altered receptor binding and viral uncoating (Romero, 2001). Although we did not further investigate the specific mechanism underlying the inhibition by fexaramine in this study, it is plausible that fexaramine interacts with the residue in the P2 subdomain of FCV VP1 to interfere with viral receptor binding and/or uncoating during virus entry. We plan to conduct co-crystallization with FCV (or FCV VP1)-fexaramine complex to understand the inhibitory mechanism, which may generate valuable information for potential optimization of fexaramine to improve its antiviral effects. We also found that the mutation in FCV 3CLpro that confers resistance to NPI52 (T138S) is located at the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 4B). Threonine at 138 position is conserved among FCV strains and corresponds to threonine at 134 position in human norovirus 3CLpro, a virus protease structurally and functionally closely related to FCV 3CLpro. Previous crystallographic study on the complex of human norovirus 3CLpro-dipeptidyl protease inhibitor showed that threonine at 134 position forms a hydrogen bond with the inhibitor that shares the core structure with NPI52 (Kim et al., 2012, Takahashi et al., 2013). Interestingly, the growth kinetics of the mutant FCVs carrying A539T or T138S were comparable to that of WT FCV, suggesting that these mutations do not affect the efficiency of virus replication in cell culture.",

Therefore we studied the effects of combination treatment of fexaramine and NPI52 in cell culture and found that combination treatment shows synergistic antiviral effects at the tested drug concentrations (Fig. 6). More importantly, combination treatment substantially delayed the emergence of resistant viruses to fexaramine or NPI52 up to 20 passages. These results provide a strong rationale for further investigation of combinational treatment of antiviral agents targeting different virus proteins to overcome resistance to single antiviral agent and enhance antiviral activity for FCV infection. In conclusion, our study reports the first entry inhibitor of FCV and potential combination use of an entry inhibitor and viral protease inhibitor against FCV infection.",
