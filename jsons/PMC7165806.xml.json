Most individuals (breeding and moulting) were caught when they were in the water and they were captured in a sweep\u2010net after short pursuits by boat. Some family groups were often caught by rounding them up where they were grazing on pastures and forcing them into nets that were mounted in advance. Individuals were sexed by means of cloacal eversion. Each Greylag captured received a Darvik neck\u2010band. These were uniquely engraved for subsequent individual recognition, and were readable from up to 600 m with a telescope under good light conditions.

When constructing an encounter\u2010history matrix (required for capture\u2013mark\u2013recapture analyses) from these data we distinguished three groups: males, females and individuals that were not sexed during the initial capture and marking. To allow estimation of survival over the first period of life extending from the breeding season to autumn (approximately 3 months, and subsequently referred to as juvenile survival), our first release of goslings was during marking (Norway) with all subsequent resightings from the Netherlands over annual intervals after the first autumn. Goslings are fitted with neck\u2010bands at about 7 weeks of age (when younger, the head is to small and the neck\u2010band slips off) and our survival estimates do not incorporate mortality prior to this.",

The software program provides parameter estimates under the essential Cormack\u2013Jolly\u2010Seber (CJS) model, but also under several models that appear as special cases of this model (Lebreton et al. 1992). When analysing resighting data from known\u2010age birds (i.e. marked as goslings), we used age\u2010dependent CJS models to assess the effect of age on survival (starting with a model with four separate age classes), after which we used models allowing for time\u2010dependent juvenile survival to investigate a time effect on this parameter.

Although there was some support for time\u2010dependence in recapture probability (\u03c72 = 25.916, df = 16, P = 0.055), the most parsimonious model was one in which resighting probability was maintained constant across sexes and over time (Table 3). There was no significant difference in survival between males and females (\u03c72 = 0.978, df = 4, P = 0.913) and survival was subsequently constrained across sexes. There was, furthermore, no significant difference between survival in the first and second year (\u03c72 = 0.934, df = 1, P = 0.334) or any subsequent age effect (\u03c72 = 1.439, df = 2, P = 0.487; Table 3) on survival after 3 months of age. The mean annual survival of geese older than 3 months of age was estimated at 0.700 (95% CI 0.672\u20130.727). Juvenile survival was estimated at 0.601 (95%CI 0.557\u20130.643) over the study period, but this varied significantly over time (\u03c72 = 57.726, df = 17, P < 0.001), with no linear trend (\u03c72 = 36.224, df = 15, P = 0.002; Table 3, Fig. 2). The most parsimonious model had two age classes: up to 3 months and older. During the second half of the study (1994\u20132002) juvenile survival was 5.2% lower than during the first half (1986\u20132004), although this was not significant (\u03c72 = 1.477, df = 1, P = 0.224). The most parsimonious model had juvenile survival constrained over 3\u2010year intervals (Table 3; Fig. 2). From the above it is clear that juvenile Greylags are particularly prone to mortality factors during the first 3 months of life, after which they follow the survival schedule of adults. When assuming equal monthly survival in our annual estimates, mean survival between autumn and the breeding season (about 9 months) would be 0.775 (using 0.700 for annual mean survival, see above). Including survival over the first 3 months would imply a first year survival rate of 0.485.",

As with most geese breeding in the arctic or temperate zones, Norwegian Greylags have distinct migration routes with traditional staging and wintering sites being used from year to year (2001, 1980). In spring and autumn, all Norwegian Greylags pass through the same staging areas in the Netherlands, where extensive observations were conducted (Andersson et al. 2001).

Juvenile survival was not correlated with survival of older birds over the same time, suggesting that different regulating factors govern survival in these two population groups. Goslings and adults are likely to suffer similar hunting mortality, but mortality incurred during the autumn migration could be much more variable in goslings. Both body condition prior to the migration and unfavourable weather conditions during the migration are likely to have a greater influence on goslings than on older birds. On the breeding grounds, goslings are flightless for an extended period when they are susceptible to predators, mainly the White\u2010tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla and Great Black\u2010backed Gull Larus marinus. Predation is, however, likely to be most substantial prior to goslings being marked, at which time they are much smaller than the adults. It is worth noting that hunting activity before goslings are fully fledged has been observed to result in the southward migration being initiated prior to full development of wing feathers (A.F. pers. obs.).

Both seasonal and annual intersexual variation in survival of geese has, however, been documented (2002, 1992, 1994, 1999), and this has been inferred to result from behavioural differences between the sexes (Schmutz & Ely 1999). For example, it has been reported that adult female Greater Snow Geese are more likely to cross the firing line (apparently due to behavioural differences in defence of young), and therefore have a higher hunting mortality, than males (Giroux & B\u00e9dard 1986). Differences in vigilance behaviour and energetic demands associated with breeding are also plausible explanations for these differences. The absence of sex\u2010specific differences in survival observed in this study suggests that behavioural differences between Greylag sexes, and the additional energetic expenditure of females relative to males during the breeding season, do not have fitness implications in terms of survival.",

It is important to note, however, that summer survival was relatively stable (although a slight decline was apparent) whereas a significant decline in winter survival was evident. If hunting is the primary mortality factor in Norwegian Greylags, hunting activities need to be considered in the Netherlands where they stage, in France which they pass through en route to Spain, and in Spain where the majority (about 11% remain in the Netherlands) over\u2010winter. Summer survival did not change significantly over the study period, and hunting activity in Norway would therefore appear to have been similar during the study period. Overall hunting pressure in the Netherlands has been considered to be low, whereas heavy, but variable hunting pressure has been noted in southern Spain (Nilsson & Persson 1993).

The decline in survival could also be a density\u2010dependent response to food availability. An increase in population density has been correlated with lower survival rates in Barnacle Geese (Owen & Black 1991). The increasing number of Greylags observed over the past few decades could have given rise to increased competition for food at the wintering grounds in Spain as well as at their staging sites in the Netherlands. Similarly, changes in food availability (agricultural foods, primarily rice) for Greater White\u2010fronted Geese Anser albifrons in California are thought to have caused changes in survival (Schmutz & Ely 1999).
