The largest number of samples are from the core study area encompassing portions of the Otjiwarongo (Otj), Okahandja (Oka), and Omaruru (Oma) districts. In this core area, 41 unrelated adults (26 males and 15 females) were fitted with radio telemetry collars, and their activities and movements were monitored for an average 19.4 (\u00b1 13) months (Marker 2000; Marker LL, Dickman AJ, Mills MGL, Jeo RM, MacDonald DW, submitted). Overall home range size was estimated for 27 cheetahs with at least 30 fixes per year using the 95% kernel method (Marker 2000; Marker LL, Dickman AJ, Mills MGL, Jeo RM, MacDonald DW, submitted). Cheetahs were classified according to the age and sex composition of the group with which they were caught into 1 of 5 social groups: single males, male coalitions, single females, mother with cubs, and independent siblings without an adult female (dam) (as in Marker et al. 2002b and 2002c) (Supplementary Appendix I).",

All microsatellites were dinucleotide repeats except Fca559 and Fca42, which had tetra-nucleotide repeats. These 38 microsatellites have been mapped to 11 of the 19 domestic cat chromosomes. Of the 38 loci, 23 were unlinked or at least 20 cM (centimorgams, a unit of recombination distance between genes on chromosomes) apart in the domestic cat and are therefore assumed to be unlinked in cheetah (Menotti-Raymond et al. 1999; Driscoll et al. 2002). Five pairs of loci were separated by an estimated distance of 12 cM (Fca85/Fca96), 9 cM (Fca75 and Fca96), 6 cM (Fca212/Fca126), 4 cM (Fca224 and Fca161), and 1 cM (Fca171/Fca161). The dye-labeled PCR products of the microsatellite primer sets were pooled and diluted together based on size range and fluorescent dye so that 3\u20136 loci could be multiplexed and electrophoresed and subsequently analyzed in an ABI 377 automated sequencer. Microsatellite allele sizes were estimated by comparison with a GS350 TAMRA (ABI, Foster City, CA) internal size standard. Data were collected and analyzed using the ABI programs GENESCAN (version 1.2.2-1) and GENOTYPER (version 1.1). PCR product length was used as a surrogate for actual repeat length (Ellegren et al. 1995), which is known in the domestic cat but not for the cheetah.",

Estimates of microsatellite size variation such as average expected heterozygosity, average variance, number of unique alleles, and average number of repeats were derived for the 89 unrelated cheetahs from the program MICROSAT (version 1.5) (Minch et al. 1996) for the 7 geographic regions. These estimates of cheetah microsatellite diversity could be biased upward relative to estimates from other felid populations as only polymorphic loci were used in the present study. Fisher exact test for deviations from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (Guo and Thompson 1992), genotypic linkage disequilibria between pairs of loci (Garnier-Gere and Dillman 1992), and pairwise genotypic and genic differentiation between populations (Goudet et al. 1996) were calculated using GENEPOP version 3.2 (Raymond and Rousset 1995). The F-statistic was calculated according to Weir and Cockerham (1984) using FSTAT, version 1.2 (Goudet 1995) and ARLEQUIN (Schneider et al. 2000) to assess possible geographic structure and levels of gene flow among the geographic regions. Standard errors of Fst and Fis estimates were obtained by jackknifing over all loci as implemented in FSTAT. When appropriate, we corrected type 1 error levels for multiple tests following the sequential Bonferroni procedure (Rice 1989). All computed P values were 2 tailed.",

The first approach was to estimate pairwise genetic distances among the set of 89 unrelated individuals and among unrelated individuals from the same area from composite microsatellite genotypes using the proportion of shared alleles (Dps) algorithm with a (1 \u2212 M) correction as implemented in MICROSAT (version 1.5) (Minch et al. 1996). Three loci (Fca 169, Fca 559, and Fca 42) were excluded from phylogeographic analyses because of insufficient data. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with bootstrap values (from 1000 iterations) from a Dps distance matrix using PHYLIP (version 3.572) (Felsenstein 1993) and was drawn using the program TREEVIEW (version 1.5) (Page 1996). The second approach was to perform a principal component analysis (PCA) and produce a population cluster matrix using the program GENETIX (4.01) (Belkhir 2000). The third approach was a Bayesian procedure, implemented in the program STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000), to identify populations or genetic clusters and to assign individuals to one of these groups. All the unrelated samples were pooled and were assumed to belong to an unknown number of genetically unique clusters (K), and the posterior probability (log likelihood, lnL) was estimated assigning priors from 1 to 7 (number of populations) to determine the number of clusters that maximized the lnL of the data. Structure was run for 5\u201310 repetitions of 100 000 iterations with a burn-in period of 100 000 iterations, assuming a model of admixture with correlated genotypes among clusters. The estimated proportion of membership (qi), or the average proportion of genotypes in each predefined group, was inferred, and based on previous studies with similar data sets, individuals with qi >0.80 were assigned to one cluster or jointly to more than one cluster if qi <0.80 (individuals with evidence of admixture).",

Similarly, animals from the southern regions of Oka, Win, and Gob are somewhat genetically distinct. Cheetahs from Oma and Otj, which are located geographically between the northern and southern groups, have genetic affinity with animals from both the north and the south. In the structure analyses, individual cheetahs from Oma and Otj are either assigned to the northern cluster or the southern cluster or are assigned to both (have a mixed heritage). This pattern could result from the higher removal rates of cheetahs in the middle part of the country, leading to increased immigration into this region. Immigration of cheetahs into Out from the north is perhaps more limited as Out borders Etosha National Park where cheetah populations are less dense due to endemic anthrax and predation by a comparatively high density of lions and hyenas (Berry et al. 1996). Immigration into Gro is probably restricted by limited habitat, as 65% of the Namibians inhabit this area and prey species have been almost completely extirpated.",

            "text": "From a behavioral ecology perspective, one of the most important findings is that most groups of cheetahs in Namibia, whether they were family groups, sibling groups, or male coalitions, consisted of related animals. In almost every case when a group consisted of unrelated animals, there were extenuating conditions that could explain the finding. For example, of the groups preclassified as sibling groups, 81% of these were composed of related animals. The 5 presumed sibling groups that had low relatedness scores were sampled at captive holding facilities with inadequate identification systems, and the initial classification of the group was probably the result of incorrect assignment of individuals into a group while in captivity. Similarly, of the 26 coalition male groups caught together on farms, only 3 groups consisted of apparently unrelated animals based on their low relatedness scores. Subsequent field observations of these groups and radio telemetry data supported the inferences resulting from the molecular genetic data. These were not intact male groups, but instead one of the captured males had been defending his territory when captured. It is a fairly common practice in Namibia for captured cheetahs to be held at the capture site as a lure to capture other cheetahs. These results suggest that, in contrast with male coalition groups in the Serengeti (Caro 1994), in Namibia, male coalition groups generally consist of related individuals. Finally, based on analyses of parentage and relatedness, there was strong support that most of the groups (21 of 24) classified as family groups a priori by observation or proximity of capture were composed of related mothers and their offspring.",

From our genetic analysis, we found a number of related animals that were previously not known to be related (Table 5). From a comparison of the distance between the capture locations of these individuals (the presumed distance the offspring had dispersed), we confirmed that male offspring dispersed significantly farther than female offspring and that female offspring dispersed farther from their sire than from their dam (Table 6).This is consistent with the finding that female cheetahs within our study area were more closely related than were males and that home range overlap was greater among related versus unrelated cheetahs.",

One example from our study suggests that play trees, much like other prominent geographic features like water holes or prominent overlooks, might be important for a wide variety of social interactions, but in ways that might be complex. In this case, an adult pair of cheetahs (AJU985 and AJU986; Table 5) that was caught together at a play tree was presumed to be a mating pair. However, parentage analyses suggested that these animals were instead a dam and son, and unexpectedly, based on the general pattern that males disperse from their natal area, subsequent radio telemetry data showed that the presumed son occupied a home range in the area of the play tree and that his dam, which occupied a completely nonoverlapping home range 100 km away, most likely had made a long-distance foray to the tree.",
