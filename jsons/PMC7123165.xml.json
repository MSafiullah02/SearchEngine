However, over the past two decades, it has become clear that these viruses can cause serious infections that require medical attention, particularly in infant, elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Historically, the most common causes of respiratory infections in cancer patients were thought to be opportunistic bacteria and fungi, but newer diagnostic methods have revealed that respiratory viruses can cause serious morbidity and mortality in such patients, including leukemia patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.",

In infants and young children, the primary infection starts in the upper respiratory tract, with rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, and cough; it may progress to lower respiratory infection (LRI) (bronchiolitis or pneumonia), at which stage most patients seek medical attention [3, 6]. It is also likely to involve the sinuses and the middle ear. RSV is known to cause apnea in infants, although the mechanism of this action remains unknown. Older children and adults \u00adtypically present with upper respiratory tract symptoms, but may also have constitutional symptoms such as fever and malaise [3, 7]. RSV upper respiratory infections (URIs) can also progress to the lower respiratory tract, particularly in institutionalized adults and those with severe combined immunodeficiency, leukemia, HSCT, and in lung transplant recipients [2, 8, 9]. These patients may present with wheezing and shortness of breath, with or without underlying comorbidities or known hyperactive airways. Almost 35% of elderly patients with RSV infections report wheezing [8\u201311].",

RSV infections in adults cannot be clinically differentiated from other viral infections that cause upper respiratory symptoms. For a specific diagnosis, RSV must be detected in respiratory secretions. Nasal aspirates or washes are most likely to give a positive RSV test in young children. If a nasal aspirate or wash cannot be obtained, a nasopharyngeal swab or throat swab may be used. Because immunocompromised or \u00adintubated patients are more likely to develop an LRI due to RSV, \u00adtracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage should be performed [8, 25]. The gold standard for diagnosing RSV remains the identification of virus causing typical syncytia in cultures of HEp-2 cells [25]. Viral cultures may take 2 days (shell vial cultures) and up to 2 weeks (routine cultures) to become positive, making isolation less relevant in most \u00adclinical settings. Other available methods include antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoflourescence assay, and polymerase chain \u00adreaction (PCR) tests. Fan et al. [26] reported a sensitivity of 65\u201395% for RSV detection using rapid antigen testing with ELISA. PCR tests have been shown to be more sensitive than direct antigen detection [27, 28].",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antihistamines have been used in patients with a URI. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, has in vitro activity against RSV and has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of RSV infections in children. Two schedules of aerosolized ribavirin have been used in immunocompromised patients: continuous and intermittent. On the continuous schedule, a daily dose of 6 g (concentration, 20 mg/mL) is delivered over 18 h via a small particle aerosol generator unit, administered via a face mask in a tent. On the intermittent schedule, a concentration of 60 mg/mL is delivered over 3 h every 8 h.",

Its early use has been shown in some retrospective studies to reduce morbidity and mortality in HSCT recipients [3, 29] and patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly when the infection is treated early on [30]. However, its effectiveness in solid organ transplantation patients remains unknown [31]. An RSV-specific monoclonal antibody (Palivizumab) did not demonstrate a therapeutic benefit in a major study conducted in children [32]. Although the combination of ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or palivizumab has not been evaluated in a randomized trial, it is sometimes used in severely ill patients with RSV pneumonia, especially HSCT recipients, given that they have high mortality rates from this infection [3, 11, 14]. In patients at risk for progression to LRI, aerosolized ribavirin should be considered at an early stage. A recent trial demonstrated that both the intermittent and continuous schedules of aerosolized ribavirin were \u00adeffective at preventing progression to LRIs in 91% and 80% of patients with RSV URIs and hematologic malignancies (including HSCT recipients), respectively [33].",

Briefly, patients should be isolated in private rooms when possible, and appropriate personnel protective equipments should be used (i.e., disposable gloves, masks, and gowns) [34]. No licensed vaccine is available for RSV; however, two agents, RSV-IVIG and palivizumab, have been used to prevent RSV infection. RSV-IVIG has been studied in children younger than 24 months with severe lung disease and those who were born prematurely [35], but it was removed from the market in 2003. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in children found that palivizumab recipients had a 45% relative reduction in RSV hospitalizations (  p  =  0.003). Twenty-one children (3.3%) died in the palivizumab group vs. 27 (4.2%) in the placebo group with no deaths attributable to palivizumab [36]. Palivizumab is easier to administer than regular IVIG, which must be given over 4\u20136 h, and does not interfere with other vaccinations. However, RSV-IVIG and IVIG may provide additional protection against other respiratory viruses as well [35, 37, 38].",

Amantadines are not effective against influenza B and resistance has been reported for 2009 novel H1N1 virus; resistance to oseltamivir has increased for the seasonal H1N1 virus (Table 32.2) [55, 56]. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible, preferably within 48 h after symptom onset [57]. Zanamivir and oseltamivir have been used extensively to treat both influenza A and B; both were shown to reduce the mean duration of symptoms by 1 day when used within 48 h of symptom onset [58]. Both neuraminidase inhibitors have been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of complications associated with influenza such as development of pneumonia when compared to placebo [59]. The most common side effects of oseltamivir are nausea and vomiting, although other toxicities have been reported. Central nervous system side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, impaired thinking, confusion, lightheadedness, and hallucinations have been reported with amantadine use.

Our data also showed no apparent benefit of aerosolized ribavirin on the mortality rate in HSCT recipients and leukemia patients [70]. On the other hand, a combination of methylprednisolone and intravenous or oral ribavirin has, apparently, been used successfully to treat PIV pneumonia in a HSCT and a heart transplant recipient, respectively [82, 83].",

In adults, infections due to adenovirus are characterized by sore throat and gradual onset of fever. Cough, coryza, and regional lymphadenopathy are commonly seen. The most common clinical symptoms besides respiratory symptoms are fever and diarrhea [3].",

Nephrotoxicity is commonly encountered with this drug and it should be used with caution.

Orally active ether lipid-ester prodrugs of cidofovir (S)-HPMPA are under development with some promising results in in vitro experiments and phase I trials [111].

The variety of viruses that can cause infection and illness in all age groups and their presence in high frequencies throughout the year describe the risk of exposure of all persons at all times including immunocompromised persons residing in the community. The immunocompromised state of many cancer patients constitutes the basis for the frequent failure of the host to promote a normal and rapid recovery from an acute respiratory viral infection and results in a more severe and prolonged infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Those respiratory viruses that are most prevalent and most prone to produce lower respiratory illnesses and pneumonia in healthy hosts, RSV, influenza viruses and PIV, are those most likely to cause severe illness and pneumonia leading to hospitalization in immunocompromised persons. However, viruses less prone to produce a lower respiratory illness but that are highly prevalent, such as rhinoviruses, may frequently be associated with severe illness. Although not generally considered respiratory viruses, the Herpes viruses are known to produce respiratory infection and disease, sometimes severe, in immunocompromised patients (Table 32.1). A historically important virus, measles virus, is now rarely encountered because of widespread vaccination.",
