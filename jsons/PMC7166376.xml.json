Abrupt weaning can contribute to intestinal and immune system dysfunctions and lead to diarrhoea (Kuang et al., 2015; Pluske, Hampson, & Williams, 1997). In order to address problems caused by weaning, antibiotics have been widely used (Cromwell, 2002; Yin et al., 2009). Misuse of antibiotics in feed has resulted in serious complications due to drug residues in animal products and increased bacterial resistance (Yen, Lai, Lin, & Chiang, 2015). Dietary antibiotics change enteric microflora that are important maintaining intestinal health and function (Guarner & Malagelada, 2003).",

It is actively transported from hen serum into the embryo via the egg yolk and provides passive immunity to embryos and offspring (Muller, Schubert, Zajac, Dyck, & Oelkrug, 2015; Sui, Cao, & Lin, 2011). IgY is resistant against specific pathogens based on the antigen the hens are immunized against. It has been shown to be effective against a variety of intestinal pathogens particularly diarrhoea pathogens such as bovine and human rotaviruses, bovine coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Salmonella (Diraviyam et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2015; Sui et al., 2011; Thu et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2011). IgY has attracted considerable interest as an alternative to antibiotics for the control of infectious diseases in the alimentary tract (Li, Wang, Zhen, Li, & Xu, 2015). The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that supplementing early weaned piglet (EWP) diets with anti\u2010E. coli IgY may affect their enteric Escherichia coli, without affecting other micro\u2010organisms, and also beneficially intestinal function.",

            "text": "Digestive system microflora play important roles in maintaining intestinal health and function (Dowarah, Verma, & Agarwal, 2017). A previous study on intestinal microbiota of weaned piglets has shown that after weaning, E. coli concentrations increased while the number of Lactobacillus decreased (Konstantinov et al., 2006). As we know, E. coli is one of the major sources of intestinal pathogens, and a few strains can induce serious illness, including diarrhoea (Hu et al., 2014). The improvement of the immunoglobulins is required to regulate and enhance immune function, which provides health benefits, diminished weaning stress and improved health status and performance of weaning pigs. This study detected significantly decreased E. coli in ileal digesta in IgY\u2010fed EWPs and antibiotic\u2010fed EWPs compared to controls. This suggests that IgY has the similar effect to antibiotic against E. coli. Antibiotic feed reduced E. coli populations in the caecum which is consistent with Wu et al. (2012), who reported that antibiotics reduced E. coli populations in the caecum compared to control EWPs. Dietary IgY supplements increased Lactobacillus population in the ileum and caecum compared with the antibiotic group and significantly decreased enterotoxin STb in caecum digesta compared to the control group. These results show that the inclusion of antibiotic in the diet reduced the proliferation of both harmful coliform bacteria and beneficial Lactobacillus in the pig's gut. Antibiotics seriously affect the activity and composition of the gut microflora. It is reported that most cases of antibiotic\u2010associated diarrhoea (AAD) may be due to direct toxics effects of antibiotics on the intestine, altered digestive function secondary to reduced concentrations of gut bacteria or overgrowth of pathogenic micro\u2010organisms (Beaugerie & Petit, 2004). Additionally, it has been reported that an increment of Lactobacillus results in competitively exclude potentially pathogenic species from colonizing the intestine (Collier et al., 2003). In our study, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium are not affected by IgY supplementation.",

            "text": "In healthy intestinal tracts, Lactobacillus dominates (Dowarah et al., 2017). Lactobacillus is considered to produce lactate from sugars as the only or major end product with some minor products such as acetate, formate or ethanol (Tsukahara & Ushida, 2002). Previous studies demonstrated Lactobacillus potential to increase beneficial bacteria and inhibit pathogenic bacteria (Hossain, Begum, & Kim, 2015; Qi et al., 2011). Lactobacillus produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide and lactoferrin which may exhibit antagonistic activity against E. coli (Li, Ni, et al., 2015). IgY supplementation significantly decreased cholesterol and low\u2010density lipoprotein concentrations and confirms this positive effect of IgY. Jeon, Kang, Kim, Hwangbo, and Park (2016) reported findings consistent with this report that IgY significantly decreases total cholesterol compared to the control group. The decreased cholesterol concentration could be attributed to assimilation (or uptake) by Lactobacillus (Buck & Gilliland, 1994) or to coprecipitate of cholesterol with deconjugated bile salts (Jin, Ho, Abdullah, & Jalaludin, 1998). Chen, Wang, Yan, and Huang (2013) reported probiotics reduced serum cholesterol and inhibit hydroxyl\u2010methyl\u2010glutaryl coenzyme\u2010A, which is involved in cholesterol synthesis. Thus, the decreased cholesterol concentration could be attributed to the reduced synthesis of cholesterol. Low\u2010density lipoprotein (LDL) is also referred to as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, because it constitutes a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (Toth et al., 2013).",

Several strategies to protect IgY from hydrolysis have been developed including liposomes (Chang, Lee, Chen, & Tu, 2002), polymeric microspheres (Torche et al., 2006) and multiple emulsifications (Cho et al., 2005). Further investigations are indispensable to determine how robust of IgY application can be. Optimizing IgY dose effectiveness via a suitable formulation to withstand the gastric environment is warranted, and we hope explore any synergistic effects of combining IgY with other therapeutic strategies, such as probiotics or plant extracts in order to improve performance.",
