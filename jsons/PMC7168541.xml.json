            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most common and costly diseases in both beef and dairy cattle worldwide (Fulton, 2009; Mehinagic, Pilo, Vidondo, & Stokar\u2010Regenscheit, 2019). Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica), Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida), Histophilus somni (H. somni), Bibersteinia trehalosi (B. trehalosi) and Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) are major bacterial pathogens, and their pathogenicity can be greatly enhanced by viral infections, which can damage the respiratory epithelium (Griffin, Chengappa, Kuszak, & McVey, 2010). Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) (Brodersen, 2010), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) (Jones & Chowdhury, 2010), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) (Brodersen, 2014) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3) (Ellis, 2010) are considered to be the most common and pathogenic viral pathogens associated with BRD. Killed and modified live virus vaccines for BRSV, BVDV, BHV1 and BPIV3 are available for BRD prevention in North America (Fulton et al., 2016). Unfortunately, assessment of the effectiveness of bacterial vaccination for BRD has indicated variable to little benefit (Griffin et al., 2010; Larson & Step, 2012), and excessive anti\u2010microbial usage for metaphylaxis raises concerns of increasing antibiotic resistance for both animals and humans (Portis, Lindeman, Johansen, & Stoltman, 2012). Bovine respiratory disease morbidity and mortality rates among feedlot cattle are not reduced despite viral vaccination and anti\u2010microbial usage (Hilton, 2014).",

As a result of these work, several unconventional viruses associated with BRD in dairy and beef cattle, such as influenza D virus (IDV) and bovine rhinitis virus A and B (BRAV and BRBV), have been identified (Mitra et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019). These studies have focused on the virome of ante\u2010mortem samples from the upper respiratory tract (nasal cavity and trachea). To the best of our knowledge, the virome of lungs with BRD has not been investigated, although this is the primary location where significant BRD lesions are usually found, and a common diagnostic specimen.",

Bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012) was used to map the trimmed reads to the host (Bos taurus) reference genome (PRJNA33843, PRJNA32899), and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) was implemented to identify the unmapped reads, which were subsequently extracted from the original fastq files using cdbyank. The extracted unmapped reads were assembled into contigs with default parameters using Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011). The assembled reads were compared with the virus Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database (Brister, Ako\u2010Adjei, Bao, & Blinkova, 2015) using BLASTn. Virus\u2010like contigs aligning over a minimum length of 100 base pairs with expect value < 10\u20133 to the RefSeq database were further examined manually by BLASTx comparison to the NCBI non\u2010redundant protein database to identify any spurious matches.

Most recently, application of advanced technologies for virus identification has resulted in further insight into the relationships between well\u2010recognized pathogens and BRD (Booker et al., 2008; Mehinagic et al., 2019; Oliveira et al., 2019). Previously, we detected 21 viruses in bovine nasal swabs and tracheal washes from western Canadian beef cattle, among which IDV, BRBV, BRSV and BCV were significantly associated with BRD (Zhang et al., 2019). In dairy calves, metagenomic sequencing showed a significant association between the presence of BRAV, IDV and bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV3) in nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal samples with BRD (Ng et al., 2015). Furthermore, another study of characterization of virome of BRD in nasal swabs from feedlot cattle suggested IDV as an aetiology (Mitra et al., 2016). In order to investigate whether these viruses play direct roles in pulmonary lesions, the metagenomic virome of pneumonic lungs was characterized.",

            "text": "The viruses detected in lung tissue were similar to those previously detected in upper respiratory tract samples; however, the prevalence of viruses in the lungs in this study was lower than that in nasal swabs and tracheal washes. There are three possible explanations for the lower viral prevalence in lungs. Firstly, viruses may have already been cleared by the host by the time the animal died or was euthanized (Fulton et al., 2009). Cattle were usually treated repeatedly before death or the owner decided to euthanize for diagnostic purposes. At that point, viruses, if any, might have already been cleared, leaving only the pulmonary lesions. Secondly, some viruses, such as IDV (Ferguson et al., 2016), preferentially infect the upper respiratory tract, not the lung. In the current study, IDV was detected in the lung of only 1/130 cattle, compared with 16/116 upper respiratory tract samples in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2019). Similarly, UTPV1 was only detected in 8.5% (11/130) of pneumonic lungs, but was the most prevalent virus in nasal swabs and tracheal washes (36.2%, 42/116) (Zhang et al., 2019). Thirdly, the method used to deplete host DNA may not be as effective in tissues samples compared with nasal swabs and tracheal washes, where there is less host material. In fact, 38.8% of sequence reads from the lung samples were host\u2010derived, compared with only 27.7% of reads from nasal swabs and tracheal washes (Zhang et al., 2019). The relatively larger amounts of contaminating host DNA could contribute to a reduction in the analytical sensitivity for viruses. The accuracy of the virome sequencing results was supported by targeted real\u2010time PCR assays with 91% agreement between the methods.",

Bovine parvovirus 2 was first reported as a contaminant of commercial bovine sera, and BPV3 was frequently detected in common laboratory reagents (Allander, Emerson, Engle, Purcell, & Bukh, 2001). Although various parvoviruses have been detected in cattle, whether these viruses cause disease in cattle remain to be investigated.

Taken together, these findings indicate the potential importance of BAV in other body systems.

They are frequently isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy cattle, but can cause disease under some circumstances when host defences have been compromised by stress or viral infection (Caswell, 2014). Experimental models of bacterial pneumonia have been successfully established by infection with BHV1 or BVDV followed by M. haemolytica (Burciaga\u2010Robles et al., 2010; Jericho & Langford, 1978). We observed significant associations of bacteria with particular types of pneumonia. M. haemolytica was associated with FBP, consistent with well\u2010established knowledge (Caswell, 2016a). We also found that H. somni was associated with SBP (but not FBP), and P. multocida was associated with BP&BIP. The strong associations of H. somni and M. haemolytica with SBP and FBP, respectively, indicate that histopathology can be useful in differentiating different bacterial aetiologies. A recent study showed that aerosolized challenge of M. haemolytica consistently resulted in development of FBP, which may indicate that M. haemolytica can also be a primary pathogen (Bassel et al., 2019) although the study design did not rule out the infection of unconventional viruses such as IDV or BRBV as a contributing factor. Interestingly, in most cases where M. haemolytica was detected, no viruses or rare bacteria were detected (Figure 4), which was consistent with results of a previous study (Fulton et al., 2009). The association of P. multocida with BP&BIP suggests an opportunistic infection from a primary or concurrent viral infection; because the pathogenesis of BIP is thought to be initiated by epithelial damage by viruses or toxic gases (Autio et al., 2007; Caswell, 2016b), consistent with the idea, in case where P. multocida was detected, other viruses were also present (Figure 4).",

Further, bronchiolitis obliterans, which is regarded as a chronic lesion, was associated with M. bovis infection, consistent with results of a recent study using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to analyse association of histological features with infectious agents in dairy cows (Oliveira et al., 2019). It is possible that chronic M. bovis infection can compromise host immunity and lead to infection with multiple viruses, or alternatively, multiple viral infections could predispose cattle to M. bovis infection.",
