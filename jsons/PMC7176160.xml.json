            "text": "Molecular biological testing has become a mainstay in the repertoire of infectious disease diagnostics like in no other field of medicine. The major ambassador of this technology is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Its popularity arose from the speed and sensitivity with which PCR made it possible to ascertain the etiology of an infection. Classic microbiological diagnostics usually takes at least 36\u201348 hours before the first results from culturing and resistance testing are available. A long delay can be fatal for the patient, so starting empirical antibiotic therapy is generally the preferred strategy. Depending on the severity of the infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics are chosen, without confirmation of the causative pathogen or its antimicrobial resistance. The development of resistance is an undesired consequence of this antibiotic strategy [4].",

In recent years, two main methods have established themselves for this direct detection, one of which is PCR. Besides PCR, immunochromatography is the other method used \u2013 often in the form of test strips (lateral flow assays) or test cards (Chapter 9). A significant advantage of test strips is their great ease of use and speed coupled with moderate cost. Notwithstanding these selling points, the performance capability of older systems is only moderate. Moreover, specific antibody responses must generally take place (for antibody detection) or specific antibodies (for antigen detection) need to be available in the target organisms before immunological rapid tests can be established. In challenging situations, where the pathogen density is likely to be low, PCR is often a better choice because of its higher sensitivity [4]. PCR has the advantage that, in addition to its main pathogen detection function, resistance or virulence factors can be determined simultaneously. In the age of multidrug-resistant (nosocomial) pathogens, rapid and reliable molecular biological differentiation is becoming increasingly important given the urgency indicated to effectively isolate affected patients at the earliest possible chance.",

In the meantime, this has undergone a paradigm shift, with the list of molecular biological methods capable of point-of-care use expanding constantly. This expanded range of the POCT applications was made possible by the development of single-use systems with integrated cartridges, where analysis occurs in a closed plastic test carrier. With the reagents pre-packaged and ready-to-use in these test cartridges (unit use), hands-on work for the user of such systems is limited to loading the sample and starting the PCR run. First, the sample is mixed with lyophilized reagents, triggering digestion of the sample. Fluid movements cause the reagent mixture to then move through cast plastic arrays or channels into the reaction chambers where the next PCR process steps (DNA amplification and signal detection) occur. By varying the reagents, the test cartridges can easily be adapted to detect the various pathogens.",

If this trend continues, the next generation will be characterized by fully portable hand-held devices that are completely independent of all stationary technology. However, in the context of infectious diagnostics, the trend toward increasing miniaturization is not always seen as progress. Methodologically, tests using smaller aliquots tend to suffer from limits to the pathogen detection sensitivity achievable because of the mostly heterogeneous sample materials collected (swabs, aspirates, biopsy tissue or the likes) and the often very inhomogeneous distribution of the individual pathogens in the sample. This aspect should always be considered when miniaturizing microbiological diagnostic devices [5].",

With regard to pre-analysis, this means that the type and volume of the sample to be analyzed must conform to the test specification and that the sample can be used directly, without prior preparation. This prerequisite can only be achieved by PCR systems designed with integrated sample preparation; other systems are excluded from the outset (Section 10.2). In medical microbiology settings, practical experience explicitly dictates that nucleic acid-based pathogen detection is only feasible in sample material that is very likely to contain traceable amounts of the target pathogen [5].",

The best solutions that minimize hands-on time are those systems where manual input is reduced to loading the sample and starting the reaction, which is otherwise fully automated. This walk-away function frees up staff to do other jobs. The output, reading and interpreting of results (post-analysis) should be clear and straight forward, not requiring further interpretation, e.g. \u201cpathogen detected/not detected\u201d or \u201cmutation present/not present\u201d. More complex interpretation of results (e.g. results from multiplex PCR) should be the responsibility of a physician specialized in microbiology. The result of a PCR analysis not performed in a central laboratory should be transferred immediately and automatically to the laboratory information system to allow cumulative result interpretation (e.g. in microbiology and infectious diseases).",

The range of available GeneXpert test cartridges has steadily increased in recent years to over twenty (Tab. 10.1, Fig. 10.2). PCR tests take at least 45\u201360 minutes (even with the GeneXpert system), which makes them slower than test strips in terms of providing POCT results. For that reason, test manufacturers have worked intensively to develop even faster technologies. By cleverly optimizing the processes, the test speed of the conventional PCR has been ramped up even further.\n",

This tube contains all necessary reagents stored within small chambers of a proprietary plastic compartmentalized system, arranged in rows. After insertion, the sample passes through these chambers step by step. The fluid column of the reagent mix only moves up and down in the analyzer, allowing it to reach the different temperature zones of the PCR. Thanks to this simple principle of up-and-down movement, the PCR requires only a small space, making the reaction significantly faster [8, 9]. Depending on the pathogen-specific application, the LIAT system delivers definitive results within 20 minutes. It therefore more suitably fulfills the above-mentioned POC criteria and assists with rapid treatment decisions on site (Tab. 10.1).",

Further details on this topic are presented in (Chapter 20). The FilmArray system by bioM\u00e9rieux is a prime example of testing for \u201csyndromic diagnosis\u201d. The panels allow the detection of numerous pathogens, which can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal illnesses and infections alongside the simultaneous detection of resistance markers (Tab. 10.1) [15, 16]. This parallel detection, however, leads to the greater need for interpretation of results and, for now, is still best suited for laboratory use.",

Linking the current assays to medical specialties, it is striking that it is the field of molecular biology that has opened up such numerous new areas of application. Five years ago, the assays were used almost exclusively to detect sexually transmitted, nosocomial and respiratory infections. More recently, they have expanded to include infection diagnostics (e.g. detection of hepatitis B and C, some as quantitative and IVD-compliant virus load assessment as well) alongside the development of very promising applications outside of microbiology (Tab. 10.1).",

The latter-named assay is the first that combines PCR and array hybridization (microarray) for point-of-care use. A cytochrome-P450 2C19 variant allele, which genetically determines the response to clopidogrel treatment, can be detected within 60 minutes [14]. Given its the highly complex nature (the assay was categorized by the FDA as \u201chigh complexity\u201d in the American approval), it remains to be seen whether testing for CYP2C19 will become established for direct point-of-care applications.",
