            "text": "The picornavirus family contains several major human and animal pathogens. Vaccines against some of these pathogens are available. However, the availability of potent antiviral compounds would be an appreciable advantage in fighting these pathogens. Inside their non-enveloped capsid, picornaviruses possess a positive sense RNA genome with a single open reading frame. Upon release into the cytoplasm, the genome is translated into a single polyprotein that is processed by virally encoded proteinases. These proteinases represent excellent targets for the development of anti-virals for two reasons. First, efficient polyprotein processing is essential for successful viral replication. Second, the picornaviral proteinases show notable differences to cellular proteinases. To aid in the development of antivirals, detailed knowledge of the mechanisms, substrate specificities and structures of these proteinases is needed. This chapter reviews recent progress, discusses selected substances with antiviral activity against picornavirus proteinases and outlines several new avenues for the design of novel anti-virals.",

However, the number of cases of wild-type PV reported worldwide in 2007 was 1,310; in the first 5 months of 2008, reports of 354 cases had been received (Anon, 2008) . Several reasons for the lack of success in completely eradicating PV are apparent. There is the often low level of immunity induced by the trivalent oral vaccine, a failure to immunise all children, sometimes for religious reasons, and the emergence of recombinant, virulent strains of PV derived from the vaccine strains themselves (Andrianarivelo et al., 1999; Katz, 2006) . Furthermore, wild-type strains of PV are still being detected in parts of Africa, even though cases of disease have not been reported (E. Wimmer, personal communication). Finally, certain immune-suppressed patients are capable of shedding PV for many years without showing symptoms (MacLennan et al., 2004; Yoneyama et al., 2001) .",

The non-vaccinated population, which would grow every year, would therefore be at risk for infection from any circulating PV. To combat this eventuality, the WHO has made a series of recommendations (Aylward et al., 2005) . One recommendation for treating post-vaccination outbreaks of poliomyelitis is the use of an anti-PV agent (Aylward et al., 2005) . The suitability and feasibility of anti-viral agents directed against PV was discussed at a meeting convened by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of the USA in November 2005. Subsequently, the NAS recommended that such anti-viral agents should be developed to treat post-vaccination outbreaks and to treat immune-comprised patients suffering from persistent infections (N.R.C. Committee on Development of a Polio Antiviral and Its Potential Role in Global Poliomyelitis Eradication, 2006) . Further arguments for the development of anti-viral agents against poliovirus can be found in a recent review (Collett et al., 2008) .",

Coxsackie B viruses have long been recognised as one of the most significant causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, a major contributor to fatal heart failure in the developed world (Baboonian et al., 1997) . One pathway to cell damage during infection is the cleavage of the structural protein dystrophin in myocytes by a virally encoded proteinase (Badorff et al., 1999) . This loss of dystrophin also aids the production and release of virus particles (Badorff and Knowlton, 2004) .

The replication of these viruses is usually confined to the upper respiratory tract and the illness is usually mild and not dangerous. However, recent investigations have revealed connections to diseases of the lower respiratory tract such as pneumonia and influenza-like disease (Turner, 2007) . Furthermore, rhinovirus infections may aggravate the condition of asthma sufferers (Johnston et al., 1993) . Two genetic groups of HRVs (HRV-A and HRV-B) have been recognised for some time and found associated with disease (Savolainen et al., 2002) . Recently, however, a new genotype of HRV, HRV-C, has been detected in patients suffering from influenza-like disease in which influenza virus could not be detected (McErlean et al., 2007) . Viruses from this HRV-C genetic group have now been shown to be causes of hospitalisation in children across the globe (Lau et al., 2007; Renwick et al., 2007) . Investigations into the properties of this newly discovered HRV genotype have not yet begun, as it has not been possible to propagate the viruses in cell culture. However, comparison of the available full length genomic sequences shows clearly that these viruses represent a new genetic group. Given the sheer numbers of HRV serotypes, control by vaccination is not an option. However, the availability of inhibitors to treat asthma patients and children hospitalised with respiratory disease brought about by HRV infections would be of significant value in the clinic. This topic has been recently reviewed by Patick (Patick, 2006) .",

There are however two scenarios in which an anti-viral agent would be useful for the treatment or prevention of FMDV infections. These are in the treatment of outbreaks in areas which have been free of FMDV (e.g. in England in 2007) and in the treatment of persistent infections. Persistently infected animals are a problem in Africa, affecting buffaloes and impala (Thomson et al., 2003) .

The information in the genome is first expressed as a large polyprotein which is cleaved into the mature viral proteins by virally encoded proteinases (Racaniello, 2007; Fig. 6 .1). Hepatoviruses (HAV) encode just one proteinase whereas enteroviruses (PV and CV), rhinoviruses and aphthoviruses (FMDV) all encode two proteinases for processing. The 3C protease (3C pro ), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase responsible for the majority of cleavage events, is found in all picornaviruses. The second proteinase encoded by entero-and rhinoviruses, the 2A protease (2A pro ), is also a cysteine proteinase with a chymotrypsin-like fold. In contrast, the second proteinase encoded by FMDV, the Leader protease (L pro ), is a papain-like cysteine proteinase . All three of these proteinases differ in many ways from the proteinases of the host and consequently represent drug targets. The 2A protein of FMDV has, in contrast, no proteolytic activity. Instead, the RNA sequence encoding the last three amino acids of the 2A interrupts the synthesis of the polyprotein chain. This particular sequence on the RNA leads the ribosome to pause and release the structural precursor. However, a certain percentage of the ribosomes remain attached to the RNA and continue translation without changing the reading frame. This allows the non-structural part of the polyprotein to be translated, but at reduced levels compared to the structural precursor. This mechanism is referred to as a ribosome skip (Atkins et al., 2007) . A third target for anti-viral agents in all picornaviruses is, of course, the viral RNA polymerase (3D pol ), the enzyme replicating the viral RNA for which there is no cellular counterpart. Over the years, most attention has focussed on the 3C pro and 3D pol enzymes because they are common to all picornaviruses and are involved in many steps of processing and replication. Indeed, a large body of information on the structures The different shadings of the 2A protein reflect differences in mechanism and size in this protein between the different genera. The proteolytic agent separating VP1 from 2A in HAV is believed to be an as yet unidentified host cell protease (Morace et al., 2008) (Adapted from Skern et al., 2002) and biochemistry of these enzymes is available (for 3C pro see Table 6 .1; for 3D pol see Ferrer-Orta et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 1997; Lyle et al., 2002; Marcotte et al., 2007) . Furthermore, inhibitors to both enzymes have been developed (Dragovich et al., 1998a; Harki et al., 2006; Huitema et al., 2008) and at least one 3C pro inhibitor (AG-7088, also known as rupintrivir) has been tested in the clinic (Hayden et al., 2003; Witherell, 2000) . The structures of picornaviral proteinases that have been determined are summarised in Table 6 .1.",

            "text": "Experience with anti-viral agents against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has shown that it is important to have more than one target for anti-viral agents to combat the development of resistance in viruses with RNA genomes. Nevertheless, in contrast to the situation with 3C pro and 3D pol , interest in the 2A pro of entero-and rhinoviruses and the Lb pro of FMDV as drug targets has been limited. This lack of interest is based on the fact that both 2A pro and Lb pro perform just one single intramolecular cleavage on their respective polyprotein. Given the rapid kinetics of these reactions (Glaser et al., 2001; Glaser et al., 2003) , the general consensus of opinion has been that it will be difficult to inhibit these reactions in the infected cell. However, recent work by Crowder and Kirkegaard (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005) has suggested that the inhibition of 2A pro cleavage by anti-viral agents would actually be a very effective strategy to block replication of those picornaviruses encoding such an enzyme. Crowder and Kirkegaard showed that mutations in 2A pro had a trans dominant effect on the replication of the wild-type virus. Thus, co-transfection of a wild-type PV RNA with a PV RNA containing a debilitating mutation in 2A pro led to a reduction in the replication of the wild-type virus. The simplest explanation of this result is that the mutant virus fails to free the 2A pro from the capsid protein precursor. This capsid precursor with the 2A pro extension can also be incorporated into the assembling wild-type capsid; however, the 2A pro extension prevents completion of the capsid and thus has a detrimental effect on the assembly and virus production of the wild-type. This phenomenon has two implications for the targeting of the 2A pro . First, it is not necessary for the 2A pro to Cencic et al. (2007) be inhibited completely. A few incorrect capsid precursors will be able to interfere with a large number of correctly processed ones. Second, it will be theoretically more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to the inhibitor because the presence of sensitive viruses will upset the replication of any resistant mutants which may arise (Crowder and Kirkegaard, 2005; Semler, 2005) . A similar situation can be imagined in FMDV with mutants that prevent processing by the Lb pro . As mentioned above, Lb pro also just carries out one intramolecular cleavage on the viral protein; unlike 2A pro , this cleavage is between its own C-terminus and the N-terminus of the capsid protein precursor (Fig. 6.1 ). This will eventually lead to the generation of an N-terminal extension of VP4. Incorporation of such molecules into the capsid can be expected to have a detrimental effect on viral infectivity similar to that found with the 2A pro extension of VP1 in PV.",

Subsequently, comparison of protein sequences and protein modelling revealed that the 3C pro , although cysteine proteases, possess a similar fold to that of chymotrypsin (Argos, 1984; Bazan and Fletterick, 1988; Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . The catalytic triad of the 3C pro was, however, predicted to comprise the residues cysteine, histidine and glutamate (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . The first structures of the 3C pro of HAV (Allaire et al., 1994) and HRV14 (Matthews et al., 1994) confirmed these predictions of a chymotrypsin fold. Furthermore, the catalytic triad of the HRV14 3C pro did indeed have glutamate as the third residue of the active site. The situation in the HAV enzyme was however less clear. Initially, James and co-workers favoured the hypothesis that residue tyrosine 143 oriented the active site histidine residue (Allaire et al., 1994; Bergmann et al., 1997) . However, in later work using an alternative crystal form, the active site had rearranged to allow aspartate 84 to orient the histidine, as seen in the canonical chymotrypsin-like enzymes (Yin et al., 2005) . Subsequent structures of 3C pro from other genera revealed that the third member of the catalytic triad was glutamate in PV 3C pro and aspartate in the FMDV enzyme (Birtley et al., 2005; Mosimann et al., 1997) .",

In contrast, the HAV 3C pro has a preference for a bulky, hydrophobic residue at P4, a small aliphatic residue at P2 and glutamine or glutamate at P1. The HAV 3C pro has little or no specificity at the P\u2032 side (Bergmann et al., 1997) . Like the HAV enzyme, the FMDV 3C pro can also accept glutamine or glutamate at P1 and prefers a bulky residue at P4. The P2 residue is frequently lysine or threonine. At the P1\u2032 position, the enzyme can accept glycine, serine and a variety of large hydrophobic residues (Birtley et al., 2005) .

The specificity for the glutamine at P1 appears to be due to the presence of the uncharged residue histidine 161 that lies at the bottom of the P1 pocket.

Such a property is not immediately obvious as the identity between serotypes can be as low as 50% (Duechler et al., 1987; Skern et al., 1985) . However, analysis shows that many of the 3C pro residues involved in binding rupintrivir are conserved in HRVs and human enteroviruses, including PV . Interestingly, rupintrivir has been shown to be very effective against PV in cell culture (De Palma, communication at the XIV Meeting of the European Study Group on the Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses, Finland, Nov. 2006 ). In addition, Fig. 6 .2a shows that rupintrivir makes contacts to both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. Figure 6 .2b shows that most of the residues at this domain interface are indeed conserved. As mentioned below, this is not the case for the domain interfaces of HRV 2A pro .",

The electron acceptor of rupintrivir is a Michael group which forms a stable covalent adduct with the SH group of the active site nucleophile cysteine 147 of the 3C pro . In Fig. 6 .2a, the cysteine 147 side-chain is covalently attached to the inhibitor. The specificity of rupintrivir derives from the moieties occupying the P1, P2 and P4 positions. At P1, a lactam ring (actually a cyclised analogue of glutamine) is present that makes favourable contacts with the residues of the P1 pocket ( Fig. 6.2a) and may also stablise the free inhibitor in a conformation close to that found in the bound inhibitor (Matthews et al., 1999) . The P2 residue of the inhibitor is a fluoro-phenyl moiety that mimics the large, bulky residue that is preferred by HRV 3C pro . Finally, the P4 moiety of the inhibitor is an iso-oxazole derivative that is well accepted by the small P4 pocket of these enzymes (Matthews et al., 1999) . The position of each of the three moieties can be clearly seen in Fig. 6 .2a.",

Interestingly, these observations show that the 3C pro binds to a specific structure rather than a particular sequence of nucleotides. This suggests that inhibitors of CV 3C pro binding may also inhibit the RNA binding of 3C pro across the genera. Very recently, the structure of the CV 3C pro itself was determined by Anand and co-workers using X-ray crystallography and the co-ordinates deposited in the database (see Table 6 .1). This structure should aid in developing specific inhibitors for the CV 3C pro and in understanding the interactions between the protein and the 5\u2032 RNA clover-leaf.",

It can even accept such bulky residues as methionine or arginine at the P1\u2032 position . Specificity at P4 in HAV 3C pro is achieved through a larger pocket than in PV 3C pro ; at P2, a small pocket is present for this residue that is absent in PV 3C pro . The P1 pocket residue of HAV is, as in HRV and PV 3C pro , an uncharged histidine residue, although the residues orienting this residue are not conserved . The difference at the P\u00a2 side is explained by the greater distance of the \u03b2-strand bI1 from the active site in the HAV 3C pro , removing the need for a glycine residue to turn the polypeptide chain of the substrate from this structure (Bergmann et al., 1997) .",

(Toyoda et al., 1986) in 1986. Subsequently, the same activity was demonstrated for the 2A proteins of HRV and CV (Liebig et al., 1993; Sommergruber et al., 1989) . Inhibitor profiling and protein modelling showed that the 2A pro , like the 3C pro , are cysteine proteinases with a chymotrypsin-like fold. It seems likely that the 2A pro arose by a duplication of the 3C pro on the evolutionary precursor of the entero-and rhinoviruses. Despite this close relationship, there are however several clear differences between the 2A pro and 3C pro that preclude development of a single inhibitor for both proteinases. These differences concern the overall structures, the mechanisms and the specificity determinants. Thus, although the 2A pro are closely related to the smaller serine proteinases such as streptomyces G protease B (SGPB) and \u03b1-lytic proteinase (Bazan and Fletterick, 1988; Petersen et al., 1999) , structural analysis of the HRV and CV 2A pro shows that their N-terminal domain lacks four \u03b2-strands present in the N-terminal domain of SGPB and 3C pro . In contrast, the 2A pro contain a zinc ion in the C-terminal domain, using a structural motif that is unique amongst the chymotrypsin-like proteinases (Petersen et al., 1999) . In terms of mechanism, all 2A pro use an aspartate residue as the third member of their active site triad; as mentioned above, glutamate or aspartate maintain this function in the 3C pro . Turning to specificity, the main specificity determinants for the 2A pro are at P4, P2, P1\u2032 and P2\u2032, with several residues being accepted at the P1 position . This is in clear contrast to the well-defined P1 specificities observed in the 3C pro .",

Table 6.2 shows that the self-processing cleavage sites for the two enzymes clearly have only a few residues in common. Table 6 .2 also shows the cleavage sites of HRV2 2A pro on the eIF4G homologues; it is believed that HRV14 2A pro cleaves the eIF4G homologues at these sites but it has not yet been demonstrated to do so. We have investigated this question by replacing the self-processing cleavage site of both HRV2 2A pro and HRV14 2A pro with that of the eIF4GI sequence shown in Table 6 .2. The 2A pro of HRV2 cleaved the eIF4GI site with the same efficiency as the wild-type sequence. In contrast, the eIF4GI cleavage site was refractory to HRV14 2A pro cleavage . Using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that lack of cleavage by the HRV14 enzyme was due to the presence of arginine at the P1 site in the self-processing reaction. HRV14 2A pro could not accept this residue whereas the HRV2 enzyme could . This suggests that the substrate binding pockets for the P1 residue on these two 2A pro differ considerably.",

            "text": "To examine this question more carefully, we examined the residues proposed to be involved in binding the P1 in HRV2 2A pro , the only 2A pro for which a high-resolution structure is available. In HRV2 2A pro , the residue at the bottom of the P1 pocket appears to be Cys101 (Petersen et al., 1999) ; the corresponding residue in HRV14 would be A104. Substitution of A104 with cysteine did not, however, confer the (Gradi et al., 2003; Skern et al., 2002 . These results show that substrate recognition differs between enzymes of the two genetic groups and indicate that we do not at present know exactly which 2A pro residues are involved in recognising the P1 residue. Insight into this question will require the determination of one or more structures of a 2A pro from the genetic group B as well as a structure of a 2A pro bound to an inhibitor or to a substrate analogue. Another clear difference between HRV2 and HRV14 2A pro is their behaviour toward the inhibitor zVAM.fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Met-fluoromethylketone). This inhibitor was developed after the observation by Deszcz et al. (Deszcz et al., 2004) that benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) could inhibit replication of HRV2 by inhibiting the activity of the HRV2 2A pro . zVAD.fmk was originally designed as a caspase inhibitor and is synthesised in an uncharged form to allow passage of the inhibitor through the cell membrane. Inside the cell, the methyl group on the aspartic acid residue is removed and the compound is able to inactivate caspases. Deszcz et al. (Deszcz et al., 2004) determined that the uncharged form of the inhibitor was responsible for the inhibition of the 2A pro . This agreed with previous data that had indicated that HRV2 2A pro can accept basic and hydrophobic residues at P1 but not acidic residues (Skern et al., 1991) . Deszcz and colleagues (Deszcz et al., 2006) made use of this property to synthesise zVAM.fmk. This substance should inhibit HRV2 2A pro through the hydrophobic methionine residue but cannot be activated to an inhibitor of caspases. In cell culture experiments, zVAM.fmk could inhibit the replication not only of the genetic group A viruses HRV2 and HRV16, but also of the genetic group B virus HRV14 (Deszcz et al., 2006) . This suggested a common mechanism of inhibition. However, further analysis showed that the HRV14 2A pro is inhibited in both intra-and intermolecular cleavage by zVAM.fmk whereas the HRV2 2A pro is only inhibited in intermolecular cleavage (Deszcz et al., 2006) (Sousa, C. and Skern, T., 2007, unpublished) . Although these experiments indicate differences in HRV 2A pro , they do suggest that it may be possible to find inhibitors that inactivate a spectrum of 2A pro , even if the mechanism of inhibition differs. Second, these experiments clearly show that it is possible to design inhibitors that are specific for the 2A pro but do not possess anti-caspase activity.",

In an attempt to investigate this further, we constructed a hybrid 2A pro containing the N-terminal domain of HRV14 and the C-terminal domain of HRV2. To achieve this, we noticed that an MfeI restriction site could be introduced into the coding region of both enzymes at two of the four residues that form the zinc binding site. These two residues, asparagine 56 and cysteine 57 in HRV14 and asparagine 53 and cysteine 54 in HRV2 2A pro , lie at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide linking the two domains ( Fig. 6.3 ). Using the MfeI and BamHI sites, we introduced the C-terminal domain of HRV2 2A pro (Fig. 6 .3a, dark blue) into the HRV14 2A pro (Fig. 6.3a, grey) .

RNAs were transcribed in vitro and translated in RRLs. Figure 6 .4 shows that the HRV14/2 2A pro hybrid was unable to cleave either of the substrates. Even after 300 min of incubation, the only product produced was the uncleaved VP1-2A pro running at 50 kDa; cleavage products running at 35 kDa (VP1) and 17 kDa (2A pro ) were absent (Fig. 6.4) . The hybrid 2A pro is clearly inactive. What might the reasons for this be? To answer this question, we examined the nature of the residues that comprise the substrate binding region at the interface of the N-and C-terminal domains in HRV2 and HRV14 2A pro . Figure 6 .5 shows that only 6 of the 20 residues lining the interface of the N-and C-terminal domains are identical in the 2A pro of the two genetic groups. Furthermore, three of these are involved in generating the active site triad. In contrast, this is not the case for the picornaviral 3C pro ; in this enzyme, the opposite is true and most of the residues lining the domain interface are conserved (Fig. 6.2 ). These differences in 2A pro between the genetic groups appear from the experiment in Fig. 6 .4 to affect substrate specificity and will have to be born in mind when designing inhibitors that should possess a broad spectrum of activity Fig. 6 .4 Self-processing of HRV14/2 2A pro hybrid proteinase on the HRV14 (a) and HRV2 (b) cleavage site. The amino acids in the cleavage sites are shown above the gels. Differences between the sites are underlined in the HRV2 sequence (b). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was programmed in the presence of 35 S methionine with in vitro transcribed RNA coding for HRV14/2 VP1-2A pro (10 ng/\u03bcl) and incubated at 30\u00b0C. Negative controls were prepared by adding water instead of RNA. 10 \u03bcl aliquots were taken at the given time points and put on an icecold mix of 25 \u03bcl 2x Laemmli sample buffer, 15 \u03bcl H 2 O and 1 \u03bcl unlabeled methionine/cysteine (20 mM). Viral proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE on 17.5% gels and visualized by fluorography. Protein standards (M) in kDa are given on the left against HRV 2A pro .

We attempted to gain information on this subject by using NMR to investigate the structure of inactive CVB4 2A pro containing 8 amino acids of VP1 at the N-terminus. The enzyme was inactivated to prevent loss of the eight amino acids of VP1 by substituting the active site residue Cys110 with alanine. CVB4 2A pro was used because we were unable to obtain soluble protein with the analogous HRV2 protein. We were able to assign 13 C and 15 N signals for most of the CVB4 2A pro (Baxter et al., 2006) . Unfortunately, however, NMR signals could not be assigned for the last C-terminal eight amino acids of VP1 and first eight N-terminal amino acids of the 2A pro . The reason for this inability was determined by performing studies on the conformational dynamics of the CVB4 2A pro . 15 N NMR relaxation measurements clearly indicated that the N-terminus of the enzyme and Fig. 6 .6 Effect of a mutation at the C-terminus of 2B on the self-processing of HRV14 2A pro on the VP1-2A pro -2B polyprotein.

Subsequently, Gorbalenya et al. (Gorbalenya et al., 1991) proposed that L pro was a papain-like cysteine protease. This proposal was further supported by the ability of E64, a classical inhibitor of papain-like proteases, to inhibit L pro (Kleina and Grubman, 1992) and modelling of the L pro based on structural comparisons with those of papain and papain-like cathepsins . The determination of the threedimensional structure of L pro in 1998 (Guarn\u00e9 et al., 1998) confirmed these findings, revealing that L pro has indeed a classical, if somewhat reduced, papain-like fold. In contrast to papain, however, L pro has no pre-pro domain at the N-terminus; instead, it possesses a C-terminal extension (CTE) of 18 amino acids protruding from the globular domain of the enzyme. The CTE is thought to be flexible enough to reach back into the active site of the enzyme to allow intramolecular self-processing at the junction of the C-terminus with VP4. In the crystal structure, however, the CTE of one molecule was found in the active site of the adjacent one and vice-versa, thus presenting a picture of an intermolecular cleavage in the form of a homodimer.",

Table 6 .3 shows the cleavage sequences of the three known in vivo substrates of L pro . At first glance, the sequences appear quite disparate and, on reflection, intensify the interest in the question why L pro does not appear to cleave more proteins in the infected cell. However, close examination reveals that the cleavage sites imply specificity at P2 for leucine or valine and a requirement for a basic amino acid at P1, P1\u2032 or P2\u2032. If a basic residue is not present at one of these positions, then a small residue such as glycine or serine at P1 or P1\u2032 or alanine or threonine at P2\u2032 is required. Mutational analysis confirmed this interpretation, showing that L pro accepted poorly substrates containing phenylalanine at P2 and did not cleave well on substrates lacking basic residues at P1, P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 (Glaser et al., 2001) . These specificity determinants of L pro are extremely unusual. It is indeed quite exceptional that a protease is able to cleave before as well as after a basic residue. This unusual property may however be advantageous in efforts to develop specific inhibitors of L pro .",

To investigate the strength of the Leu Leu Asn Val Gly Ser Arg Arg Ser dimer further, we then turned to size exclusion chromatography, as this approach requires much lower amounts of protein than NMR. With this method, we were able to estimate an upper limit of 500 nM for the K D of L pro dimer dissociation. This value suggests that L pro may be present as a dimer even at the low concentrations of L pro found in the infected cell and thus be relevant for biological activity. This observation represents an interesting avenue of future research. In a further attempt to examine the self-processing reaction, we decided to examine the properties of a mutant of L pro in which residue leucine 200 (i.e. the last but one residue at the C-terminus corresponding to the P2 position of the substrate) had been replaced by phenylalanine. We had previously shown that this mutant was severely impaired in self-processing (Kuehnel et al., 2004; Mayer et al., 2008) and believed that the presence of the phenylalanine would impair or even completely eliminate dimer formation. This would allow us to examine the properties of a monomeric form of L pro that contains a full-length CTE that could still be expected to move in and out of the active site, affecting the NMR signals of atoms in this area and providing information on self-processing.",

            "text": "The above discussion concentrated on the feasibility of developing classical inhibitors of the proteolytic activity of the picornaviral proteases. In the last few years, it has however become clear that both the HRV2 2A pro and the L pro interact with the cellular protein eIF4G using exosites (i.e. regions of the protein away from the canonical substrate binding site). This was first observed with mutations in the CTE of L pro lying ca 40 \u00c5 from the active site that interfered with the cleavage of eIF4GI without affecting the self-processing reaction (Foeger et al., 2002) . Subsequently, it was shown that residues 183-195 of the CTE bound directly to the region 645-657 of eIF4GI, about 20 residues upstream of the L pro cleavage site between glycine 674 and arginine 675 (Table 6 .3) (Foeger et al., 2002; Foeger et al., 2005) . A similar situation was also observed with HRV2 2A pro . Here, residues 17-35 of the N-terminal domain, lying outside of the canonical substrate binding domain, were found to affect eIF4GI cleavage without impairing the self-processing reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis and binding experiments showed that this region of the HRV2 2A pro interacted directly with a region of eIF4GI between residues 600 and 674, some distance from its actual cleavage site between amino acids arginine 681 and glycine 682 (Table 6 .2) (Foeger et al., 2003) . Thus, in spite of the fact that HRV2 2A pro and L pro are completely different enzymes in terms of structure, mechanism and specificity, both have evolved a mechanism to enable rapid cleavage of a molecule that is central to protein synthesis. At present, no host proteins have been identified as binding to eIF4G in this same manner. Therefore, inhibition of these specific interactions may also represent drug targets to fight infections with these viruses. The recent report of an inhibitor that can inhibit the interaction of eIF4GI with its binding partner eIF4E strengthens this notion (Moerke et al., 2007) . The idea of inhibiting the HRV2 2A pro or L pro interaction with the eIF4G homologues is in line with a recent review covering the general idea of inhibiting protein-protein interactions for therapeutic purposes (Wells and McClendon, 2007) . In the future, it will therefore be important to identify further specific interactions of picornaviral proteases with viral and host proteins in order to widen our options in fighting picornaviral infections.",

            "text": "Picornaviral proteinases represent attractive anti-viral targets for two reasons. First, they are absolutely required for the replication of the viruses, second, their substrate specificities differ from proteases of the host cell. Despite intensive research over the last 25 years, however, anti-virals to treat picornaviral diseases have not been approved. The most promising of all candidates, rupintrivir, unfortunately failed to reduce viral severity in the clinic and development was halted. This result implies that treatment of picornaviral infections may require two anti-viral substances attacking different viral targets for full inhibition. Although the development of a second substance as promising as rupintrivir may seem a daunting task, the work described here outlines several new avenues for the generation of such substances. Above all, the L pro of FMDV and 2A pro of rhino-and enteroviruses have not been fully examined. In addition, the possibility of inhibiting RNA binding by 3C pro requires further investigation. All of these approaches need to be examined soon if anti-viral therapy is to play a role in the end-game of poliovirus eradication.",
