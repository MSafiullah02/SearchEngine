The findings in these reports were made using data on specific populations or regions.

Survival rates at the 14-day mark are medically significant as they demonstrate survival at the point at which patients most typically experience symptoms. The 45-day mark was selected to demonstrate the progression of the disease for an advanced period. There were 83 patients with no symptoms; the author used date of laboratory confirmation instead of date of symptom onset for these patients. Survival rates can be interpreted by the portion of MERS patients who were still alive at 14 and 45 days after they experienced symptoms.",

The author calculated region-specific 14- and 45-day survival rates (Figs 1 and 3). For the MERS patients studied, the Republic of Korea or other countries (95.83% and 91.67%) had much higher 14- and 45-day survival rates than the Middle East (84.09% and 75.00%) and Saudi Arabia (82.51% and 62.92%), respectively. The differences in the region-specific survival rates remain significant after accounting for patient and disease factors such as gender, age, comorbidity, symptoms, healthcare worker and source of infection. For instance, the hazard of death on 45-day post-symptoms was 4.1 and 5.0 times higher in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia compared with the Republic of Korea or other countries, respectively. The disparities in survival rates between regions are probably explained by the delay in reporting MERS symptoms, and consequently delay its diagnosis [15]. The median time from date of onset of symptoms to death was lower in the Republic of Korea or other countries than in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia. More research studies are required to assess whether diagnostic delay [15] and disease characteristics can explain the differences in survival rate by geographical regions.",

The findings of this study showed that 14- and 45-day survival rates tend to rise with increasing age (Figs 1 and 3) and were similar in women compared with men. The estimate of the 45-day survival rate in patients older than 65 years was 44.86%, in patients aged 60\u201365 years it was 60.38%, in patients aged 30\u201350 years it was 74.27% and in young patients aged 29 years or less it was 87.78%. These results support various epidemiological cohorts from Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea, which stated that older age is a risk factor for death in MERS patients [8\u201314]. The high death rate among the older age group could be attributable to the greater number of patients with comorbidities in this group. The prevalence of comorbidities increases with age: 28.6% in the young age group <30 years, 62.7% in 30\u201359 years, 93% in 60\u201365 years and 97% in older than 65 years. Thus, comorbidities may be associated with both age and mortality.",

The study included 116 (13.1%) who were healthcare workers, of which five died. The higher survival rates within the healthcare workers group could be attributed to educating healthcare workers on preparedness, access to healthcare or following proper infection control standards. An explanation for lower survival rates in the non-healthcare workers group is the large gaps in public awareness of the clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV [16, 17]. Public health and health system interventions are needed to reduce the spread of the MERS by raising public awareness in identifying the clinical symptoms and by early screening and diagnosis. This could reduce the high rate of mortality in non-healthcare workers.",

This information could be important to identify which underlying condition is associated with death. Patient condition and clinical outcomes may not be final as data are updated routinely. Another potential confounding factor was not available, such as access to healthcare, and it may be considered a modifiable factor to account for. Finally, an inverse-probability Kaplan\u2013Meier curve may also be appropriate to model this dataset, as it may provide perspective into the data and a visual way to show adjusted survival rates. Despite these limitations, the study author was able to use the estimated 14- and 45-day survival rates, measuring the time from symptom onset to outcome. To date, no study has provided survival estimates and links to regions. The study provided information on region-specific 14- and 45-day survival rates, which are found to account for the differences in mortality. The large sample size used was also the main strength of this study. Future study could investigate diagnostic delay, which can be defined by the difference between date of symptom onset and the time of diagnosis. This may reduce poor outcomes.",
