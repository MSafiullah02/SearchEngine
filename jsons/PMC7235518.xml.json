Italy has more hospital beds per capita, a population one\u2010fifth the US and as of this writing over 11 500 deaths. The base transmission rate, case fatality rate and community spread remain elusive. Italian physicians with experience caring for COVID\u201019 patients recommend containment strategies such as test, quarantine and isolate and mitigation techniques of social distancing and hygiene.\n3\n\n",

The Diamond Princess is the only closed data set with everyone in the population tested. No measures were put in place on the ship to contain or mitigate the spread of COVID\u201019 so it does not seem unreasonable to expect similar results in larger populations in the absence of accepted public health measures.",

Public health strategies of containment such as test, quarantine and isolate in combination with mitigation of social distancing and hand washing are proven and seem reasonable given the existing evidence. Other experts recognize the difficulty in obtaining reliable data but nevertheless believe the current evidence presents a compelling case for action.\n5\n Dr Ioannidis may underappreciate the variable incubation period and asymptomatic transmission of the highly contagious COVID\u201019 virus.\n6\n The contrarian position seems reckless and may compel leaders to delay actions costing thousands of human lives.",
