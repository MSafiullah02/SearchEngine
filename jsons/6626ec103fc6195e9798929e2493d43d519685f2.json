            "text": "Non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat COVID-19 transmission have worked to slow the spread of the epidemic but can have high socio-economic costs. It is critical we understand the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical interventions to choose a safe exit strategy. Many current models are not suitable for assessing exit strategies because they do not account for epidemic resurgence when social distancing ends prematurely (e.g., statistical curve fits) nor permit scenario exploration in specific locations. We developed an SEIR-type mechanistic epidemiological model of COVID-19 dynamics to explore temporally variable non-pharmaceutical interventions. We provide an interactive tool and code to estimate the transmission parameter, \u03b2, and the effective reproduction number, R E . We fit the model to Santa Clara County, California, where an early epidemic start date and early shelter-in-place orders could provide a model for other regions. As of April 22, 2020, we estimate an R E of 0.982 (95% CI: 0.849 -1.107) in Santa Clara County. After June 1 (the end-date for Santa Clara County shelter-in-place as of April 27), we estimate a shift to partial social distancing, combined with rigorous testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals, is a viable alternative to indefinitely maintaining shelter-in-place. We also estimate that if Santa Clara County had waited one week longer before issuing shelter-in-place orders, 95 additional people would have died by April 22 (95% CI: 7 -283). Given early life-saving shelter-in-place orders in Santa Clara County, longer-term moderate social distancing and testing and isolation of symptomatic individuals have the potential to contain the size and toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in Santa Clara County, and may be effective in other locations.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is rapidly expanding across the globe and has the potential to overwhelm healthcare systems, 2 killing hundreds of thousands to millions of people worldwide in the process 1 . Without an effective vaccine 3 or specific drug therapy, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, diagnostic and 4 serological testing, and contact-tracing are the best available tools to slow the spread of the pandemic and to 5 mitigate its health toll. Governments and other decision-makers have used models to predict the spread of 6 COVID-19 and show the benefits of social distancing for \"flattening the curve,\" i.e., slowing the epidemic-7 reducing and delaying the peak-to prevent medical systems from becoming overwhelmed. 8 Many decision-makers internationally, nationally, and locally, have used models that are statistical 9 curve-fits, such as the IHME model 2 , to the observed numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, or 10 deaths, without capturing the underlying epidemiological dynamics of transmission. While statistical mod-11 els can be successful at describing near-term epidemic trajectories, they may fail to capture the high degree 12 of uncertainty in the long-term epidemic process, and therefore should not be used to project far into the 13 future 3 . More worryingly, these models cannot anticipate impacts of major shifts in policy, such as ending 14 shelter-in-place orders and reopening businesses. Thus, policy informed by statistical curve-fitting models 15 may fail to anticipate the potential for a resurgence of COVID-19 epidemics, and therefore will not be able 16 to adequately inform exit strategies from shelter-in-place and other social distancing interventions. 17 Epidemiological models that directly model the transmission process almost universally predict that 18 lifting interventions too soon will result in a devastating resurgence in the epidemic 1 , a phenomenon sup- 19 ported by historical evidence, including data from the 1918 flu pandemic 4 . Balancing the economic and 20 social costs of shelter-in-place orders with those of resurgence events, all of which are overwhelmingly 21 borne by the most vulnerable, make identifying safe and effective exit strategies an urgent priority. How- 22 ever, many currently available epidemiological models are not set up for other scientists or policymakers 23 to conveniently explore a variety of exit strategies for specific locations to which the model is also fit. 24 We developed an epidemiological compartment model of COVID-19 dynamics that uses a time-varying 25 transmission parameter, \u03b2, to investigate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on epidemic dy- 26 namics and control. The model incorporates transmission from both asymptomatic and presymptomatic 27 infectious people. By fitting the model to local epidemic dynamics (using daily reported COVID-19 deaths), 28 we can estimate key epidemiological metrics and evaluate the effectiveness of different long-term interven- 29 tion strategies. Specifically, we explore three classes of strategies: 1) long-term shelter-in-place orders, 30 which we consider the most drastic approach; 2) widespread testing and isolation of symptomatic people 31 paired with less intensive social distancing in the general population; 3) an adaptive triggering approach 32 2 .

We therefore model a homogeneous population with 38 population-average parameters that reflect the demography of the population of interest. As a case study, 39 we focus on Santa Clara County, California, where the first COVID-19 death in the U.S. was retroactively re-40 ported from February 6, 2020, and where the first-in-the-nation shelter-in-place order took effect early in the 41 epidemic, on March 17, 2020. We estimate transmission rate for Santa Clara County under pre-intervention 42 and shelter-in-place conditions, calculate reproduction numbers before and during interventions, explore 43 the impact of long-term intervention strategies, and investigate counterfactuals to understand the impact of 44 early intervention decisions. This case study illustrates how the model could be tailored to other locations 45 to understand the impact of long-term interventions in COVID-19 epidemic dynamics.",

Tracking hospital-55 izations and deaths allows us to compare our simulations to data sources that should be more reliable than 56 confirmed cases, particularly in the absence of widespread rapid testing and case detection. Mildly symp-57 tomatic cases are defined as those people that show symptoms but do not require hospitalization, while we 58 assume that all severely symptomatic cases will eventually require hospitalization.

As an alterna-156 tive to blanket shelter-in-place orders over long periods of time, we explored the efficacy of test-and-isolate 157 and adaptive triggering methods for epidemic control. We found that test-and-isolate measures paired with158 lighter social distancing, especially when combined with early shelter-in-place orders, can be effective at 159 keeping the epidemic under control while presumably alleviating some of the social and economic costs 160 of shelter-in-place. Given the social and economic challenges of maintaining shelter-in-place for months 161 at a time, test-and-isolate interventions are a potential alternative until better therapeutics become widely 162 available. Improved testing coverage would also have the added benefit of: 1) improving implementa-163 tion of contact tracing to identify and quarantine contacts before they potentially become asymptomatic 164 and presymptomatic spreaders, and 2) helping to fit models and other public health surveillance tools to 165 COVID-19 cases, rather than deaths. 166 Recent evidence suggests that a large proportion of infected people may be asymptomatic or presymp-167 tomatic 25,26 , and that a larger proportion of the population than previously understood may have already 168 been infected (Stanford seroprevalence study: 27 ; Harvard seroprevalence study: 28 ).

The model 186 clearly shows that early action in California, including work-from-home and shelter-in-place orders, saved 187 lives. The qualitative effect of early social distancing on epidemic dynamics is robust to a wide range 188 of parameter uncertainty; we estimated that waiting even one additional week to implement shelter-in-189 place would have led to an additional 7-283 deaths in the county by April 22, 2020. With the benefit of 190 early action, some increase in social contact in the general public may be possible by June 1, given that 191 the capacity for testing and isolation of symptomatic people continues to increase. Though we find that 192 adaptive triggering is unlikely to work based on current conditions in Santa Clara County, it may be a 193 viable option in locations such as Italy or India where legally-enforced lockdown has led to more stringent 194 reductions in social contacts 30 . Expansion of diagnostic testing capacity is a top priority for long-term 195 COVID-19 mitigation efforts because of its multifaceted benefits for concentrating social distancing efforts 196 on those most at risk of transmitting COVID-19, for determining the true size and trajectory of epidemic 197 dynamics, and for providing more certainty to individuals experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. 198 During an unfolding pandemic, modeling is an essential tool for tactical decision-making, strategic 199 planning, and communication of qualitative scenarios to the public. The number of COVID-19 models has 200 grown apace with the pandemic itself, and many of these models have overlapping goals and approaches; 201 organizations such as the MIDAS Network (Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study) provide an im-202 portant service in coordinating data-gathering and modeling efforts and in providing publicly available 203 resources for the modeling community 29 . The rapid adoption of open-data policies from across the spec-204 trum of academic, government, business, and media organizations has been a major boon to research and 205 pandemic control efforts. At the same time, keeping up with the growing COVID-19 modeling literature is 206 nearly impossible, and the differences among models remain confusing to the public amidst a fragmented 207 pandemic response across US states, counties, and the federal government. While statistical curve-fitting 208 models may be valuable for modeling short-term trajectories in cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and health-209 care capacities 2,3 , epidemiological models that capture the underlying transmission dynamics are critical for 210 evaluating the impact of major changes in policy over the long term. Epidemiological compartment mod-211 els vary widely in how they subdivide populations and in the assumptions that govern movement among 212 compartments. Individual-based, network, and meta-population models expand on compartmental mod-213 els by capturing elements of individual and population heterogeneity that influence epidemic dynamics, 214 12 .",
