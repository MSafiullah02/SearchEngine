            "text": "Some countries\u2014Thailand, China, and, to a lesser degree, Vietnam\u2014had set out a strategic vision to strengthen future capacity in preparedness planning. Others, including Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, took a strategic approach similar to that of most European plans. These strategic plans focused on management of currently available resources and preparation for the deployment of resources such as stockpiled antiviral agents and vaccines. The polarisation of approaches in the region contrasts with the uniform approach taken by countries in Europe. The plans of Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand compared very favourably in terms of completeness and quality with the best European plans. However, as in Europe, all of the plans contained some gaps. The plans of lower-income countries in the region addressed several issues that were largely neglected by most European plans. The potential therefore exists for countries (including those which are still formulating their plans) to draw on the strengths of preparedness plans developed by other countries. The panel\nsummarises some strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the preparedness plans of these selected Asia\u2013Pacific countries. For brevity, differences between countries and areas of coherence are presented by comparing planned public-health interventions.PanelFeatures of Asia\u2013Pacific influenza preparedness plans\nStrengths of plans\n\n\u2022All recognised the effect of a potential influenza pandemic and gave political support to preparedness planning.\u2022All linked surveillance and response measures for animals and humans, including specific measures targeted at bird handlers\u2022All incorporated wide multisector cooperation, involving major stakeholders from health, animal, and civil-response sectors.\u2022All proposed measures for early containment, on the basis that an original outbreak within their country was a likely scenario.\u2022Several recognised the need for surveillance to be strengthened, and for laboratory capacity in the region to be reinforced. They contained provisions for developing financial and organisational support.\u2022All discussed use of various social distancing measures, including travel restrictions (both internal and international).\u2022Most outlined strategies for organisation of the response from health services, relying mainly on specialised units. Several countries had advanced preparations for cooperation with other countries in the region (eg, New Zealand's arrangement with Australia about supply of vaccine).\u2022All addressed education and awareness for the population, and in many countries educational materials have already been developed.\u2022Several outlined ethical principles that govern access to scarce resources.\u2022Several, such as the Hong Kong plan, included the private health-care sector in preparation and implementation.\n\nGaps and weaknesses in plans\n\n\u2022Although most identified which organisation would be responsible for achieving a specific response, operational responsibility remained somewhat unclear, especially at the local level.\u2022All countries organised their responses according to pandemic phases which identify specific alert mechanisms. Because in some plans these phases differ from WHO pandemic phases, confusion could occur during the management of a regional or international crisis.\u2022Some focused solely on situations involving outbreaks of H5N1 that originated within their borders, and did not discuss measures to address an imported epidemic.\u2022Several combined short-term and long-term actions. Some needed to create operational plans for pandemic response, to supplement long-term capacity development.\u2022Most did not detail drug strategies or logistics for provision of antiviral drugs to the population. Most did not identify or enumerate groups within the population who should receive these drugs as a priority. Several described stockpiling of antivirals at a level that would only provide coverage for a very small proportion of the population. They did not clearly specify treatment or use of prophylactics.\u2022Most had poorly developed policies for vaccination of the population. Some discussed the inadequate vaccine manufacturing capacity in the region, and suggested that access could be very restricted. Several countries (China, Thailand) discussed the possibility of setting up local production. Only a few plans defined priority groups for vaccination.\u2022Most relied on health care institutions for the treatment of influenza patients (notably special infectious diseases hospitals). Some designated specific facilities as hospitals for infectious diseases. Few developed the possibility of caring for patients at home.\u2022Many did not make adequate provision for the maintenance of essential services (although this issue might be covered in generic contingency plans).\u2022Most addressed communication, although some did not plan on a phase-by-phase basis. Strategic communication could prove critical during a pandemic, and needs to be improved in some countries.\u2022Several did not provide adequate operational procedures for key stakeholders during each phase of the pandemic. The Thai plan in particular retained the format of a strategic framework rather than an operational guide.\n",

            "text": "There were some substantial differences between the strategies described in the Asia\u2013Pacific plans and those in Europe. As any outbreak in an Asia\u2013Pacific country would probably originate in a rural area, all the Asia\u2013Pacific plans focused on this setting, and on early containment strategies. For example, specific situations with cases in animals were included in the planning for human pandemic phases. As a result, the Asia\u2013Pacific countries more closely and explicitly linked their planned responses to human influenza pandemics with those for avian influenza. The Asia\u2013Pacific plans also emphasised the integration of human and animal health more than did the equivalent plans in Europe. The Hong Kong plan was especially strong in its attention to issues that could be important to countries of southeast Asia and that had not been fully addressed elsewhere. These issues included the need for improved exchange of surveillance information between health and animal sectors, the capacity for joint investigation and response, and the education of poultry smallholders and wet-market poultry workers.",

            "text": "Another notable strength of the Asia\u2013Pacific plans was that the countries we selected had incorporated lessons learned from the recent past, including from H5N1 and SARS outbreaks, into their pandemic preparedness plans.11, 13 For example, during the SARS outbreak, databases linked to the police system for tracking down criminals were used to coordinate mass-contact tracing. This so-called major incident and disaster support system will, during an influenza pandemic, be used again. A further important difference between the Asia\u2013Pacific countries' plans and those in Europe was their focus on the early containment of disease, and their coherence in strategies such as social distancing. For example, all countries in the Asia\u2013Pacific region recommended use of travel restrictions or screening measures. Whether this coherence was by design is unclear. The common reliance on such strategies might also indicate that these countries had few supplies of antiviral drugs and little access to vaccines. Many of the gaps identified in the plans of European countries were more acute in the plans of low-income Asia\u2013Pacific countries. For example, countries had not done sufficient planning to identify priority groups to receive vaccines and antiviral drugs; make logistical arrangements for distribution of scarce resources; develop strategies to maintain essential services; anticipate the probable response of different health systems during emergency situations; or ensure that preparedness plans could be implemented.",

European institutions are coordinating national plans in an attempt to align their approaches. This is proving to be a substantial challenge,19 but one from which other regions might be able to learn. Even in the face of a global pandemic, public health is still governed by the principle of national sovereignty; nation states retain ultimate authority in decision-making, and regional institutions can only offer guidance and support. But guidance and support can be a powerful means of ensuring coherence. By working closely with countries, institutions might be able to plan for and respond effectively to issues that could become politically charged. The new International Health Regulations have been substantially improved by measures to strengthen global surveillance and response, and make it incumbent on states to develop capacity in these areas. But national responses aimed at controlling potential pandemics remain just that\u2014national. Although the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remains a loose coalition, it could nevertheless draw on the early experience of initiatives such as the European Centre for Disease Control, and attempt to steer the preparedness planning of Asia\u2013Pacific countries.",

Most affluent countries have stockpiled antiviral drugs and, in the event of a pandemic, could also rely on their capacity to produce vaccines or agreements to obtain vaccine rapidly. By contrast, one could argue that lower-income countries in the Asia\u2013Pacific region would find it difficult to access sufficient quantities of these globally scarce resources. These countries also face challenges in dealing with other communicable diseases.",

Massive logistical challenges would have to be met for any pandemic, which will probably originate in this region, to be contained at an early stage.24 If this were to prove unattainable, some have warned of a potential risk that poor countries in the region would be reluctant to cooperate with the international community\u2014eg, by providing information to assist with disease surveillance, or isolates of the virus to facilitate vaccine development and production. Countries might choose not to prioritise these tasks if faced with uncertain returns and a range of other pressing demands.",

The next pandemic will test notions of global solidarity. If the pandemic were to occur tomorrow, we would probably be found wanting.",
