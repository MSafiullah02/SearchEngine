COVID-19, like other coronaviruses, is a single-strand RNA virus with a distinct crown-like outer envelope. 1 It can cause a range of manifestations, from no symptoms, to mild respiratory symptoms, to fatal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are neurotropic and can enter the brain through various mechanisms, including the olfactory neural pathway and they can cause a significant inflammatory response, which can cause both peripheral and CNS manifestations. 2 Prior reports from the SARS CoV-1 epidemic identified a range of psychiatric complications in affected patients with SARS, including adjustment-related anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, as well as organic hallucinosis and organic manic disorder. 3 High dose corticosteroid use has been identified as a significant associated factor in psychotic presentations. 3, 4, 5 Longer term survivors of SARS-CoV-1 were found to have PTSD (54%), Depression (39%), panic disorder (32.5%) and obsessive compulsive disorder (15.6%) 31-50 months after the diagnosis, however, short or long term psychosis was not found in this cohort. 6 To date, there are few reports describing psychiatric symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal study of psychological symptoms in 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities during the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, repeated four weeks later at the peak of the epidemic revealed 28% reported high levels There is prior evidence to suggest that infection with certain coronaviruses is associated with recent-onset psychotic symptoms, however, new-onset psychosis in otherwise asymptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 has not been described. 11 ",

If a COVID-19-psychosis exists, treatment of the psychotic symptoms with antipsychotic medication, while potentially effective for treating symptoms, would likely be obviated or mitigated by effective treatments of the underlying COVID-19 infection and its associated inflammation.",

Finally, Qui et al. surveyed 52,730 persons throughout China, Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong on January 31, 2020, using a COVID-19 PeritraumaticDistress Index (CPDI) which was validated for use in the survey.8 In this study, 35% of respondents reported significant psychological distress, with those closest to Wuhan, women, individuals 18-30 years old, the elderly, and more educated individuals reporting the highest levels of distress.8 Importantly, none of these studies addressed COVID-19 status in the respondents.",
