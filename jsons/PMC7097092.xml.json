In the gastrointestinal tract, trillions of microorganisms colonize the mucosal surface and lumen and constantly release immunomodulatory molecules that interact with and shape the immune system1. Most of these microorganisms are symbionts or so-called commensals and do not generally evoke a detrimental inflammatory response. However, pathogens have the ability to invade the mucosal barrier and underlying tissue, inducing the production of cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial molecules.",

            "text": "A central and rapid mechanism triggering an inflammatory response occurs through activation of the innate immune signalling complex called the inflammasome2,3. The inflammasome is formed in a variety of immune and non-immune cells when a subset of cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors known as inflammasome sensors recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)4. To date, members from three families of pattern-recognition receptors are known to have an established role in the assembly of an inflammasome: NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4 and neuronal apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) from the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family; absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) from the AIM2-like receptor (ALR) family; and pyrin from the tripartite motif-containing protein (TRIM) family5 (Fig. 1). Several other sensors have been suggested to activate the inflammasome, including the NLR family members NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP9 (NLRP9b in mice) and NLRP12, the DNA sensor IFN\u03b3-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and the RNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I; also known as DDX58); however, the ability of these sensors to form inflammasome complexes is still uncertain6. On activation, inflammasome sensors recruit the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC; also known as PYCARD) and the cysteine protease caspase 1, and form a single cytoplasmic aggregate known as the inflammasome speck6. Caspase 1 is activated in this complex, inducing proteolytic cleavage of the pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 and the pore-forming protein gasdermin D, which results in the release of bioactive IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 into the extracellular milieu and pyroptosis, respectively7. Bioactive IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and certain DAMPs can be secreted through the gasdermin D pores before rupture of the host cell membrane, cell lysis and cell death8\u201310.",

            "text": "An inflammasome complex is generally categorized into a canonical or non-canonical inflammasome. The inflammasome sensors NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, NAIPs, AIM2 and pyrin are capable of assembling a canonical inflammasome complex15 (Fig. 1). The canonical inflammasome is a protein complex comprising one or more inflammasome sensors, ASC and caspase 1. The non-canonical inflammasome refers to an activation pathway of the NLRP3 inflammasome that specifically requires mouse caspase 11, human caspase 4 or human caspase 5 (ref.16). The current conceptual view is that inflammasome sensors either directly bind and interact with a ligand, such as flagellin, DNA or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or indirectly sense a physiological aberration, such as ion fluxes and mitochondrial dysfunction17. The former case is exemplified by AIM2, caspase 4, caspase 5, caspase 11 and NAIPs. Direct binding between double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and AIM2, independently of the DNA sequence, via electrostatic interaction initiates activation of the AIM2 inflammasome18\u201321. Similarly, direct binding between cytosolic LPS and caspase 4, caspase 5 or caspase 11 initiates activation of the non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway22. Activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome requires initial recognition of the ligand by NAIP23\u201327. The single NAIP encoded in the human genome is capable of recognizing the needle and inner rod components of the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and flagellin subunits of bacteria28\u201330. Of the mouse NAIPs, NAIP5 and NAIP6 directly bind flagellin subunits, and NAIP1 and NAIP2 bind the needle and inner rod components of the T3SS, respectively28,31\u201334. Ligand-bound NAIPs then recruit and induce oligomerization of NLRC4 in order to catalyse the assembly of a functional NAIP\u2013NLRC4 inflammasome complex35,36 (Fig. 1).",

Typhimurium, E. coli and C. rodentium have been found to be recognized by caspase 4, caspase 5 and caspase 11 on the basis of cell culture and mouse studies16. LPS from these bacteria is liberated in the cytoplasm through a host-mediated process requiring interferon-inducible GTPases96. These interferon-inducible effector proteins rupture the membrane of the pathogen-containing vacuole and/or the bacterial cell membrane96. Cytosolic Gram-negative bacteria that naturally escape the pathogen-containing vacuole, such as S. flexneri and Burkholderia thailandensis, transport their LPS into the cytoplasm of macrophages, where the hexa-acylated lipid A portion of the LPS binds and activates caspase 4, caspase 5 and caspase 11 (refs22,97,98). Indeed, the naturally cytosolic bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. thailandensis and a genetically engineered strain of S. Typhimurium that are incapable of remaining in the pathogen-containing vacuole of macrophages and thus enter the host cytoplasm aberrantly, are rapidly cleared from the host in a caspase 11-dependent manner99,100. Furthermore, outer membrane vesicles carrying LPS are shed by E. coli and most Gram-negative bacteria101. These outer membrane vesicles are phagocytosed by macrophages, leading to LPS-induced activation of caspase 11 and the non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome even in the absence of bacterial invasion of the host cell102.",

Rearrangement of the cytoskeleton in enterocytes is required for epithelial cell extrusion, and caspase 8 has been implicated in this extrusion process during S.

Of clinical importance in this bacterial category are the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori and several toxin-producing foodborne bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. H. pylori, the most common bacterial cause of gastric cancer107, encodes flagella and flagellin A (FlaA) subunits whose structures evade detection by the NAIP\u2013NLRC4 inflammasome108. Instead, H. pylori infection induces ROS production, potassium efflux and lysosomal destabilization in the host cell, ultimately leading to activation of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome109\u2013113. Further studies have shown that the H. pylori virulence factors cag pathogenicity island and urease B subunit potentiate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of IL-1\u03b2109,112,113. Excessive production of IL-1\u03b2 could be a vital link between H. pylori infection and tumorigenesis in the stomach. Indeed, a study found that a transgenic mouse strain engineered to overexpress human IL-1\u03b2 in the stomach is prone to the development of gastric cancer, either spontaneously or after colonization with Helicobacter felis, a model organism for H. pylori114. The specific inflammasome involved in the development of gastric cancer is not known; however, an association between polymorphisms in the genes encoding NLRP3 and caspase 1 and patients with gastric cancer has been reported115. Furthermore, H. pylori infection suppresses the expression of the microRNA molecule miR-22 in gastric epithelial cells, which leads to elevated expression of NLRP3 and cellular proliferation116. These studies suggest that activation of the inflammasome by Helicobacter spp. infection contributes to the molecular basis of gastritis and gastric cancer.",

The Gram-positive bacterium C. difficile is a causative agent of diarrhoea associated with the use of antibiotics, toxic megacolon and colonic perforation117. The toxins toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) secreted by C. difficile can inactivate host transforming protein RHOA at the GTPase switch I region; this RHO-inactivating activity is sensed by pyrin, resulting in the assembly of the pyrin inflammasome51,52. The physiological function of pyrin in the gastrointestinal tract remains unexplored, and further studies are required to clarify its role. However, wild-type mice treated with the IL-1R antagonist anakinra are protected from C. difficile-toxin-induced intestinal injury118. This finding indicates that activation of the pyrin inflammasome in response to C. difficile infection might lead to excessive IL-1-mediated inflammation and pathology that is detrimental to the host. Pharmacological inhibitors of microtubules are efficacious in blocking the pyrin inflammasome in cell culture systems54,119,120, but their clinical applications against pyrin-mediated pathology have not been tested in animal models.",

Typhimurium, E. coli or other non-gastrointestinal bacteria (Fig. 4a), resulting in a state of reduced inflammation that can be readily exploited by bacterial pathogens during infection of a cell or a mouse133\u2013136. Others have proposed that NLRP6 and NLRP12 mediate activation of caspase 1 in response to infection by C. rodentium and Yersinia pestis, respectively137,138, and that NLRP12 functions in dampening the cell-intrinsic migratory capacity of neutrophils139. A further study suggests that the C57Bl/6J mice that are used widely in research harbour a missense mutation in the Nlrp12 gene that impairs the ability of NLRP12-expressing macrophages to draw neutrophils to the site of inflammation in response to bacterial infection140. These conflicting studies highlight that the biological functions of NLRP6 and NLRP12 should be revisited and should take into account the genetic background of the mouse strains, cell types, bacterial agents and the experimental approaches used.",

Deletion of the Nlrp3 gene in mice offers protection against polymicrobial endotoxaemia following caecal ligation and puncture145,146. In this model of systemic inflammation, the lack of inflammasome activity impairs the production of pro-inflammatory and endogenous lipid mediators but increases the levels of pro-resolving lipid mediators145. Moreover, LPS-induced endotoxaemia promotes secretion of bile acids from hepatocytes in mice; bile acids are a form of DAMP that either synergize with ATP to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome147 or signal through the membrane receptor G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GBAR1) to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome148.",

Evidence has emerged that inflammasomes respond to some of these gastrointestinal viruses. Earlier studies had demonstrated that the DNA virus adenovirus induces the production of IL-1\u03b2 in circulation and in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells of mice153. Further functional studies have shown that adenovirus, specifically its virion component, triggers activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in human THP-1 macrophages and primary mouse macrophages154. Adenovirus-induced secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in human monocyte-derived macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells partially requires Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)155,156, presumably owing to TLR9-mediated sensing of viral DNA as the virus penetrates the cell membrane and enters the endosome. Injection of an adenovirus vector into mice triggers NLRP3-dependent production of IL-1\u03b2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting a physiological role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in licensing an innate immune response to adenovirus in vivo154. This finding is also consistent with the observation that IL-1R, which is activated downstream of inflammasomes, incites an acute and deleterious inflammatory signalling cascade in mice infected with adenovirus153. The magnitude of the inflammatory response is reduced in mice lacking IL-1R or in wild-type mice treated with an anti-IL-1 antibody153, suggesting that blockade of IL-1 signalling prevents overt inflammation that might otherwise be damaging to the host.",

The role of inflammasomes in the host defence against this virus was revealed when the poorly characterized NLR member NLRP9b was found to mediate sensing of rotavirus and drive the production of IL-18 and pyroptosis in organoids generated from the small intestine of mice161. Furthermore, mice lacking NLRP9b are substantially more susceptible to rotavirus infection, harbour a higher viral load and develop more severe intestinal pathology than wild-type mice161. Mouse NLRP9b and its human counterpart, NLRP9, are strongly and specifically expressed in ileal epithelial cells and primary intestinal epithelial cells, respectively161 (Fig. 2). Both mouse NLRP9b and human NLRP9 cooperate with the RNA sensor DEAH box protein 9 (DHX9) to sense dsRNA161 (Fig. 4a), implicating the existence of an RNA-sensing NLRP9 inflammasome complex in the host defence against rotavirus infection. A protective role of inflammasomes was also observed in a previous study showing that administration of bacterial flagellin to mice \u2014 causing activation of NLRC4 and the membrane-bound flagellin sensor TLR5, which induced the production of IL-18 and IL-22, respectively \u2014 mediates clearance of rotavirus within 24 h (ref.162). Recapitulating the beneficial effects of flagellin, coadministration of IL-18 and IL-22 similarly drives anti-rotavirus immunity in infected mice, supporting the view that inflammasome signalling can mediate protection against rotavirus infection.",

In concert with the RNA sensor DHX15, NLRP6 interacts with viral RNA and mediates the recognition of the ssRNA viruses encephalomyocarditis virus and murine norovirus165 (Fig. 4a). In this case, NLRP6 does not assemble an inflammasome. Instead, the RNA-bound NLRP6\u2013DHX15 complex migrates to the mitochondria, where it interacts with the signalling adaptor mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS) to induce the production of type I and type III interferons and viral clearance165 (Fig. 4a). These studies underscore emerging roles of the inflammasome and associated signalling molecules in antiviral defence of the gastrointestinal tract. The relative contribution of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion versus pyroptosis in driving immunity to viruses remains largely unknown. The current availability of mice lacking gasdermin D will enable exploration of this emerging research area.",

Inflammasomes are known to recognize major protozoal pathogens, including Leishmania spp., Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma spp.167. However, information concerning the biological importance of inflammasomes in the context of gastrointestinal protozoa is limited. The foodborne protozoan Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebiasis, which is characterized by dysentery, amoebic colitis, amoeboma (the formation of fibrotic tissue masses in the intestinal wall) and invasive disease of the brain, lung and liver168. There is evidence to support the idea that E. histolytica infection activates caspase 1 and induces secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in both human and mouse macrophages169. Pharmacological blockade of potassium efflux inhibits activation of caspase 1, IL-1\u03b2-release and pyroptosis in THP-1 macrophages or intestinal epithelial cells that have been infected with E. histolytica170. Further studies indicated that the parasite integrin-binding cysteine protease E. histolytica cysteine protease gene 5 (CP5) mediates activation of the host \u03b15\u03b21 integrin during parasite\u2013macrophage contact, leading to the release of ATP and subsequent activation of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome171. The importance of the inflammasome in E. histolytica infection is partially inferred by the observation that recombinant IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are cleaved and inactivated by E. histolytica CP5 (refs172,173).",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease who were homozygous for any one of these six polymorphisms have an impaired ability to express NLRP3 and secrete IL-1\u03b2 in response to LPS stimulation in vitro178. A further study reported that a heterozygous NLRP3 polymorphism, resulting in a mutation at residue Q705K, is associated with poor survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC)180. Global expression analysis of genes encoding cytosolic innate immune sensors revealed that the expression of genes encoding NLRP3 and other inflammasome sensors is substantially reduced in tumour tissues compared with non-tumour-associated tissues in patients with CRC181. Similar observations have been made in mice during colitis-associated CRC182. However, how reduced expression of these genes is initially triggered or executed mechanistically is unknown.",

DSS-induced activation of the inflammasome in mice also causes a loss of enteric neurons and onset of abnormal gut motility189. The activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome during DSS-induced colitis is controlled by the microRNA molecule miR-223, which binds the miR-223-binding site within the 3\u2032 untranslated region of NLRP3 (ref.190). However, the state of hyporesponsiveness of colonic macrophages to NLRP3 activators is lost during DSS-induced colitis95, which might fuel inflammation. Indeed, studies in mice have also reported a deleterious or non-existent role for NLRP3 or caspase 1 and caspase 11 in colitis and colitis-associated CRC191\u2013194. The biological basis of these discrepancies is unclear; however, differences in gut microbiota, diet and/or housing conditions might affect the activity of the inflammasome (the differences in the microbiota are specifically discussed later). Indeed, a ketogenic diet or caloric restriction that increases the production of the ketone body \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate from the liver contributes to the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome195. Similarly, omega-3 fatty acids signal through the metabolite-sensing receptors G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40; also known as FFAR1) and GPR120 (also known as FFAR4) to inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and prevent diet-induced insulin resistance196. By contrast, short-chain fatty acids from dietary fibres bind to the metabolite-sensing receptor GPR43 (also known as FFAR2) on enterocytes, stimulating potassium efflux that drives activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and protection against colitis197,198. A diet rich in cholesterol or saturated fatty acids also promotes activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mice199\u2013203, whereby a cholesterol-rich diet increases inflammation and tumour burden199, but a high-fat diet reduces glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity200. These studies provide evidence to indicate that dietary components, in association with the gut microbiota, are critical modulators of inflammasome activity and susceptibility to the development of intestinal inflammation, cancer and metabolic syndromes.",

            "text": "The protective role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in colitis and CRC is attributed in part to the secretion of IL-18 (Fig. 5a). Mice lacking IL-18 are highly susceptible to the development of colitis and CRC183,212,213. Injection of recombinant IL-18 reduces intestinal inflammation and tumour burden in inflammasome-deficient mice that had been administered AOM and DSS; the same treatment also ameliorated colitis in inflammasome-deficient mice exposed to the chemical colitogen oxazolone183,187,204,211,214. IL-18 functionally exerts healing properties184,185,187,214 and triggers natural killer cell-mediated killing of colonic tumour cells that have metastasized to the liver215. Another study challenged the view that IL-18 is beneficial in intestinal inflammation and reported that the IL-18 and IL-18 receptor signalling pathway drives depletion of mucus-secreting goblet cells, such that a loss of the mucous layer augments sensitivity to DSS-induced colitis in mice216. Similarly, a transgenic mouse strain overexpressing IL-18 develops aggressive colitis in response to DSS owing to increased levels of infiltrating macrophages in the colon217. One possibility that might reconcile the diametrically opposing roles of IL-18 is the ability of this cytokine to downregulate the soluble IL-22 receptor called IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP)218. IL-22BP modulates the bioavailability of IL-22, a cytokine capable of suppressing early intestinal damage but also promoting tumour development over time218 (Fig. 5a).",

            "text": "Studies in humans have revealed that gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding NLRC4 are associated with enterocolitis and autoinflammation222\u2013224. For example, a substitution mutation within the HD1 domain of the NLRC4 protein is linked to recurrent enterocolitis and autoinflammation in several members of the same family222. A newborn baby from this family and carrying this mutation died 23 days after birth owing to severe gastrointestinal complications, fever and systemic inflammation222. A further study identified that a heterozygous de novo substitution mutation in the nucleotide-binding domain of NLRC4, potentially causing destabilization and autoactivation of the protein, was linked to macrophage activation syndrome, gastrointestinal pathology, splenomegaly and systemic inflammation223. Monocytes or macrophages carrying the aforementioned disease-associated mutations undergo spontaneous activation of the inflammasome and pyroptosis and secrete increased levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (refs222\u2013224), suggesting that unchecked inflammasome activation contributes to the molecular basis of these autoinflammatory conditions. Of clinical importance is that the aforementioned patient with the substitution mutation in NLRC4 responded to treatment with the recombinant IL-1R antagonist anakinra223. A newly identified patient with the heterozygous de novo mutation in NLRC4, who also experienced enterocolitis and skin rash, responded to a combined blockade therapy targeting IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (ref.225). These studies exemplify the success of experimental targeted therapies in the treatment of inflammasome-mediated disorders.",

Mechanistically, NLRC4 inhibits cellular proliferation and promotes apoptosis via an undefined mechanism192, whereas NAIPs inhibit proliferation in enterocytes by blocking phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) independently of NLRC4 (ref.226) (Fig. 5b). A possible scenario is that either spontaneous activation or loss of function associated with the NAIP or NLRC4 signalling axis could upset the equilibrium of the gut ecosystem and drive intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis. Immunization of mice with tumour cell lines expressing flagellin \u2014 to trigger activation of the NAIP\u2013NLRC4 and TLR5 pathways \u2013 induces clearance of tumour cells by innate immune cells and tumour-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells227. Thus, modulation of the NAIP\u2013NLRC4 and/or the IL-1\u2013IL-18 pathways might provide a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy.",

            "text": "The inflammasome-associated sensor AIM2 also contributes to the pathogenesis of colitis and CRC205\u2013208. The levels of AIM2 expression in tumour tissues often predict survival in patients with CRC228. Patients whose tumour cells lack AIM2 expression are threefold more likely to die within 5 years of diagnosis than patients whose tumour cells retain some level of expression228. Reflecting the scenario in humans, the expression of the Aim2 gene is markedly reduced in inflamed and tumour-associated tissues of mice, and mice lacking AIM2 are hypersusceptible to both colitis-associated and spontaneous colorectal tumorigenesis205,206. AIM2 has functions independent of the inflammasome that drive protection against both colitis-associated and spontaneous CRC, the latter of which arises from a mutation in the mouse homologue of the human APC gene or from aberrant \u03b2-catenin activation205,206. AIM2 suppresses the ability of the DNA-binding kinase DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) to activate RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) and transcription factor MYC proto-oncogene protein, ultimately preventing excessive proliferation of stem cells in the colon205,206 (Fig. 5c). A similar negative regulatory effect of the orphan receptor NLRC3 on the AKT\u2013mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways activated during colitis-associated CRC or spontaneous CRC has been described229 (Fig. 5c). Pharmacological inhibitors of the AKT\u2013mTOR pathway are efficacious against the development of colitis-associated or spontaneous CRC in mice lacking either AIM2 or NLRC3 (refs205,206,229). The precise identity or source of the ligand(s) activating these sensors in the colon is not known. It is possible that self-DNA liberated from the damaged intestinal barrier or DNA derived from the gut microbiota might activate AIM2 (ref.230) (Fig. 5c). Consistent with this hypothesis, AIM2 can localize to DNA in the nucleus of mouse intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells following dsDNA breaks caused by ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents231. The generation of conditional mouse models that enable deletion or re-expression of AIM2 and other related sensors in all cells or in certain cell types once tumours are established would provide additional insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the operation of these sensors. These studies would also aid further assessment of the translational potential of targeting these sensors in cancer immunotherapy.",

NLRP6 controls intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis via multiple mechanisms (discussed further later), including modulation of IL-18 secretion163,234,235,237, curtailing the colonization of pro-colitogenic gut bacteria163 and promoting secretion of mucus in goblet cells137,236 (Fig. 5d). NLRP6 expression in enterocytes and inflammatory monocytes has been reported to mediate protection against DSS-induced colitis163,235,237. NLRP1b regulates activation of the inflammasome and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 specifically in non-haematopoietic cells204, whereas caspase 11 triggers IL-1\u03b2\u2013IL-18-dependent and IL-1\u03b2\u2013IL-18-independent functions209\u2013211, with both sensors mediating protection against DSS-induced colitis. A side-by-side comparison revealed that, under isobiotic conditions with normalized gut microbiota across genotypes, mice lacking caspase 1, but not mice lacking caspase 11, were hypersensitive to DSS-induced colitis188. Evidence from this study would seem to favour a role for canonical inflammasome complexes over the non-canonical inflammasome in this mouse model of intestinal inflammation. Although these studies point towards a protective role of inflammasomes in the context of intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis, a study found that deletion of the genes encoding the mucous layer components core 1-derived and core 3-derived intestinal O-glycans in mice causes colonic mucous barrier breach, spontaneous colitis and the development of colorectal tumours, and further deletion of the genes encoding caspase 1 and caspase 11 reduces the propensity of colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis239. These findings illustrate that in the presence of pre-existing immunological dysregulation triggering overt inflammation, blockade of inflammasome signalling might inhibit an inflammatory circuitry that normally fuels disease progression. Development of safe and efficacious modulators of AIM2, NLRP1 and NLRP6 and investigations into the bilateral interaction between inflammasomes and the gut ecosystem would create new avenues for the treatment of intestinal inflammation and cancer.",

This pro-colitogenic signature is defined by an increased relative abundance of Prevotellaceae and the phylum Candidatus Saccharibacteria, reduced relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and the transmissible nature of the pro-colitogenic microbiota through means of cross-fostering and cohousing techniques163,242. Furthermore, NLRP6 dampens spontaneous colitis in mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by reducing levels of the mucus-degrading bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila243. Carriage of a transmissible pro-colitogenic gut microbiota has also been described in mice lacking the inflammasome components AIM2, NLRP3, ASC, caspase 1 or caspase 11 or mice lacking the related NLR member NLRP12 (refs163,186,205,207\u2013209,244,245). Similar to the findings with NLRP6, reciprocal exchange of the gut microbiota between wild-type mice and mutant mice lacking AIM2 or NLRP12 elevates the susceptibility of wild-type mice, but reduces the susceptibility of mutant mice, to colitis-associated tumorigenesis205,244, suggesting that the colitogenic potential and transmissibility of the gut microbiota influence disease outcome.",

Phylogenetic analyses of wild-type mice and littermate-controlled mice lacking either NLRP6 or ASC failed to reveal any difference in the composition of the gut microbiota246. Lifetime separation of wild-type mice and mice lacking NLRP6 also does not seem to promote alterations of their gut microbiota profile or differential susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis246, casting doubt over the previously suggested role of NLRP6 and ASC in driving dysbiosis163. This study also argued that any difference associated with the gut microbiota might be entirely dependent on the facilities used to house the animals246. Thus, food sources, gut microbiota and sterilization techniques used by different mouse vivarium across the globe can influence the activation status of inflammasomes. Future experimental approaches should be more tightly controlled to examine the role of the gut microbiota in any disease context, including the use of littermate controls and careful evaluation of cage-to-cage and room-to-room effects and the overall sterility of the facility.",

            "text": "Despite the uncertainty surrounding the nexus between NLRP6 and the gut microbiota, the mechanistic functions of NLRP6 have been further characterized against the backdrop of intestinal inflammation, cancer and metabolic syndromes. NLRP6 senses the microbial metabolite taurine and drives the secretion of IL-18 and antimicrobial peptides to maintain a healthy gut microbiota and to promote antitumour immunity in mice163,248 (Fig. 5d). By contrast, the microbial metabolites histamine and spermine suppress NLRP6-dependent IL-18 secretion in mice, indicating that components of the gut microbiota can reciprocate and fine-tune the activities of NLRP6 (ref.248) (Fig. 5d). The NLRP6\u2013gut microbiota axis modulates the expression of the chemokine CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF and, therefore, the overall inflammatory state of the intestinal tract163,237,242. In the absence of NLRP6, the dysbiotic gut microbiota developed as a result induces the expression of CCL5 in enterocytes; CCL5, in turn, mediates the secretion of IL-6 and drives proliferation of epithelial cells and tumour formation in mice163,242. Deletion of the gene encoding CCL5 in mice prevents colitis and colitis-associated tumorigenesis despite these mice carrying a dysbiotic gut microbiota163,242, placing dysbiosis upstream of CCL5-mediated immune dysregulation. Furthermore, inflammatory monocytes residing in the lamina propria promote NLRP6-dependent and IL-18-dependent secretion of TNF and feature a protective role in DSS-induced colitis and colitis-associated tumorigenesis237.",

This NLRP6 response mediates secretion of mucus via granule exocytosis and prevents colonization of the mouse gut by C. rodentium137. Further studies have shown that sentinel goblet cells located at the colonic crypt entrance execute NLRP6-dependent secretion of mucin 2 (MUC2) to expel intruding bacteria found in the inner mucous layer236 (Fig. 5d). In the small intestine of mice, a loss of endogenous NLRP6 expression owing to stress is linked to the development of intestinal pathology and changes to the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Clostridiales, Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Streptococcaceae249. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) agonist rosiglitazone, among other functions, elevates the expression of NLRP6 in the small intestine and prevents stress-related intestinal pathology in mice164,249. Whether this therapeutic effect is directly or specifically dependent on the ability of rosiglitazone to modulate the expression of NLRP6 remains unclear.",

Typhimurium-encoded E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SlrP apparently prevents infection-induced anorexia owing to a blockade of signal transduction to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve252.

The specific PAMPs and DAMPs that trigger activation of the inflammasome in the gut in non-infectious diseases remain largely unknown. What is clear is that the development of intestinal inflammation and cancer is intimately linked to dysregulated inflammasome signalling and/or dysbiosis. This connection is in part owing to the ability of the inflammasome and the gut microbiota to regulate one another. Although advanced sequencing technologies have been informative in providing a snapshot of the global changes of the gut microbiota in the presence of inflammasome dysregulation, the causative microbial species or population responsible for a specific clinical manifestation has not been identified. Furthermore, spatial and temporal changes to the gut microbiota over the length of the intestine and over time with respect to inflammasome dysregulation have not been investigated. Nevertheless, further studies are needed in light of new evidence suggesting that the role of the inflammasome in regulating the composition of the gut microbiota is not always apparent and is, in fact, heavily influenced by a multitude of genetic, environmental and experimental factors associated with animal models246,247.",
