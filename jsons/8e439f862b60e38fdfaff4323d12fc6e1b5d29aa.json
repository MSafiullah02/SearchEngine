Axonopathies are important medical entities in their own right (Watson and Dyck, 2015) , but in addition, illnesses once considered primary neuronopathies are now thought to begin with axonal degeneration. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease (Liang et al., 2019; Stokin et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2019) , Parkinson's disease (Burke and O'Malley, 2013; Pelzer et al., 2019; Tagliaferro et al., 2015) , and motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Fischer et al., 2004; Moloney et al., 2014; Venkova et al., 2014) . Moreover, conditional knockout of NTE in the mouse CNS produces vacuolation and other degenerative changes in large neurons in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum (Akassoglou et al., 2004) , along with degeneration and swelling of axons in ascending and descending spinal cord tracts (Read et al., 2009) . In humans, NTE mutations cause a variety of neurodegenerative conditions resulting in a range of deficits including spastic paraplegia and blindness (Hufnagel et al., 2015; Kmoch et al., 2015; Synofzik et al., 2014) . Mutations in the Drosophila NTE orthologue SwissCheese (SWS) produce neurodegeneration characterized by vacuolization that can be partially rescued by expression of wild-type human NTE, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for certain human neurological disorders (Sujkowski et al., 2015; Sunderhaus et al., 2019b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 444, "end": 467, "text": "(Watson and Dyck, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}, {"start": 631, "end": 651, "text": "(Liang et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 652, "end": 672, "text": "Stokin et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 673, "end": 691, "text": "Yuan et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF311"}, {"start": 714, "end": 740, "text": "(Burke and O'Malley, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 741, "end": 761, "text": "Pelzer et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 762, "end": 787, "text": "Tagliaferro et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 860, "end": 882, "text": "(Fischer et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 883, "end": 904, "text": "Moloney et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 905, "end": 926, "text": "Venkova et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1123, "text": "(Akassoglou et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1238, "text": "(Read et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF224"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1413, "text": "(Hufnagel et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1433, "text": "Kmoch et al., 2015;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1456, "text": "Synofzik et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1754, "text": "(Sujkowski et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF266"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1780, "text": "Sunderhaus et al., 2019b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This chapter defines NTE and OPIDN, presents an overview of OP compounds, provides a rationale for NTE research, and traces the history of discovery of NTE and its relationship to OPIDN.

First, from a chemical standpoint, \"organophosphorus\" is the correct name for this generic class of chemicals. In contrast, \"organophosphate\" and \"organophosphorus ester\" refer to specific subclasses of OP compounds (Eto, 1974; IUPAC, 1978) .

Table 1 summarizes chemical and genomic manipulations of NTE and their outcomes in various species. The most enigmatic and controversial aspect of NTE and its presumptive role in OPIDN is the apparent requirement for aging of the inhibited enzyme as the initiating event in the axonopathy. This theory proposes that inhibition of the catalytic activity of NTE is not enough to precipitate OPIDN and that a suitable chemical modification of the protein is also required. By this criterion, OPIDN results from combining a loss of physiological function with a gain of pathological/toxic function in NTE rather than arising from a loss of its physiological function alone. Decades of research focused on OPIDN have led toxicologists to this interim conclusion (Glynn, 2000; Richardson et al., 2013) . On the other hand, as we shall see, recent studies directed toward understanding the physiological and pathogenic functions of NTE/PNPLA6 have challenged the gain of toxic function hypothesis, favoring instead the seemingly simpler idea that OPIDN is due to prolonged inactivation of the catalytic activity of the protein (loss of physiological function) (Glynn, 2007; Read et al., 2010) . As we seek explanations that might reconcile the toxicological and genetic findings, we should keep two important facts in mind: (1) no drug or toxicant acts exclusively on a single target (Talevi, 2015) , and (2) genetic or chemical manipulation of a given target elicits compensatory mechanisms (Schenone et al., 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 937, "end": 950, "text": "(Glynn, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 951, "end": 975, "text": "Richardson et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF234"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1346, "text": "(Glynn, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1365, "text": "Read et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF225"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1571, "text": "(Talevi, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF274"}, {"start": 1665, "end": 1688, "text": "(Schenone et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 187, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "NTE and OPIDN"}, {"text": "NTE was discovered using a chemical approach.

Reactivation can be accelerated by strong nucleophiles such as certain oximes (Fig. 8) . (Main, 1980; Richardson, 1992; Thompson and Richardson, 2004) . (Main, 1980) . Serine esterases inhibited by OP compounds containing certain labile linkages, such as P-O-R or P-NH-R, can undergo a further reaction (aging), whereby a net loss of the R-group occurs, yielding a negatively charged organophosphyl group still covalently attached to the active-site serine residue of the enzyme. The rate constant for aging is denoted by k 4 . Depending on the esterase and the inhibitor, aging can proceed via an S N 1 mechanism (e.g., unimolecular scission of an R-O bond to yield RH) or an S N 2 process (e.g., nucleophilic displacement of RO-by H 2 O to yield ROH) (Richardson et al., 2020) . If the original inhibitor contains a chiral phosphorus atom, the aged species produced by either mechanism becomes achiral, because the negative charge is delocalized over two oxygen atoms, rendering them equivalent. The charged phosphyl group is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the oxyanion hole of the enzyme, and the negative charge repels nucleophilic reactivators (Masson and Nachon, 2017) . The result is that the aged enzyme is intractable to reactivation. Thus, k 4 can be determined by rapidly inactivating the enzyme via preincubation with an OP inhibitor, removing or diluting the inhibitor to prevent ongoing inhibition, taking aliquots at timed intervals for reactivation by adding fluoride ion or an oxime, and measuring the residual activity (Richardson, 1992) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 548, "end": 560, "text": "(Main, 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 561, "end": 578, "text": "Richardson, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}, {"start": 579, "end": 609, "text": "Thompson and Richardson, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF275"}, {"start": 612, "end": 624, "text": "(Main, 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF172"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1237, "text": "(Richardson et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1636, "text": "(Masson and Nachon, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2017, "text": "(Richardson, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF230"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 545, "text": "(Fig. 8)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Interactions of OP inhibitors with serine esterases"}, {"text": "As aging progresses, the enzyme becomes increasingly resistant to reactivation.

Accordingly, to understand the science of NTE and to avoid reinventing what has already been devised, it is prudent to retrace the story of its discovery and conceptual evolution. This story began with some clever chemical thinking about an important and intriguing toxicological problem long before the application of modern molecular biology and bioinformatics gave us our current view of this fascinating protein. Moreover, there is still much to be learned about NTE, and in the spirit of \"\u2026 what's past is prologue \u2026.\" (Shakespeare, 1623) , its history is likely to provide valuable clues that can help us draw the blueprint for solving more of its mysteries in the future.

Somewhat later, in 1972, Aldridge collaborated with Elsa Reiner, a visiting scientist from the Institute for Medical Research in Zagreb, to produce the book, Enzyme Inhibitors as Substrates: Interactions of Esterases with Esters of Organophosphorus and Carbamic Acids (Aldridge and Reiner, 1972) , which is now regarded as one of the great classics of mechanistic toxicology (Witschi and Lock, 2001 ). Aldridge kept his staff heading in the right direction for making important discoveries with the continual reminders, \"What question are you asking?\" and \"Go after the anomalies -expected answers seldom tell us anything interesting; pursuing the unexpected will lead to the breakthroughs\" (W.

Second, in order to simplify and increase the sensitivity of esterase assays compared to the cumbersome and relatively insensitive Warburg manometric method, Johnson sought to develop a colorimetric assay. Realizing that his substrate of choice was PPA, which would be hydrolyzed by esterases to phenylacetic acid and phenol, he reached back to 1946 to retrieve a report on a quantitative colorimetric approach for determining concentrations of phenolic fungicides in fabrics (Gottlieb and Marsh, 1946) and adapted it for use in his esterase assays.

In this abstract, Johnson was referring to the fact that the esterase inhibitor was \"neurotoxic,\" a term used then in context to indicate that a compound was neuropathic, i.e., capable of producing OPIDN, but it appears that he may have at that time unconsciously christened NTE with its initial name, \"neurotoxic esterase.\" In his first full paper referring to neurotoxic esterase ( Johnson, 1974) , Johnson maintained a provisional status to the name by always putting quotation marks around it. Soon thereafter, at the urging of one of us (RJR), who was then a postdoc in his lab, Johnson became convinced that his new entity was fully fledged and allowed its name to stand undiminished by, as he would say, \"inverted commas\" ( Johnson, 1975a,b,c) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 391, "text": "( Johnson, 1968;", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 392, "end": 407, "text": "emphasis added)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 792, "end": 808, "text": "( Johnson, 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1160, "text": "( Johnson, 1975a,b,c)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discovery and naming of NTE"}, {"text": "During the next few years, in private correspondence and conversations at scientific conferences, a number of scientists expressed confusion over the name of Johnson's enzyme, saying that the nomenclature suggested that the esterase itself was neurotoxic.

Johnson acquiesced to this logic and began referring to NTE as \"neuropathy target esterase\" , a new name that seemed more descriptive of its role as the esterase site (2) At the end of the preincubation interval, substrate (PV) is added for a timed incubation period, during which NTE and other esterases hydrolyze PV to valeric acid and phenol. The colorimetric reagent 4-aminoantipyrine (AAP) is then added along with K 3 Fe(CN) 6 to form the plum-red phenol-AAP chromophore.

Absorbance A is not required; it is included here for illustrative purposes. The blank is self-correcting, but it is good practice to include a tissue blank to check for nonenzymatic generation of phenol and a reagent blank to check for decomposition of the substrate into phenol and valeric acid ( Johnson, 1977; Kayyali et al., 1991) .

The results were interpreted to indicate that CNB regions could modulate NTE catalytic activity and that the mutant forms of human NTE retained some degree of their biological function, suggesting that disruption of the catalytic function of SWS was not the only factor in disease pathogenesis (Sunderhaus et al., 2019b) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 894, "end": 920, "text": "(Sunderhaus et al., 2019b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NTE disease-causing mutations in humans"}, {"text": "It has been over 50 years since the discovery of NTE and nearly that long since publication of the theory that both inhibition and aging of >70% of NTE in the nervous system are required in order to produce OPIDN ( Johnson, 1969b ( Johnson, , 1974 .

Furthermore, nonaging inhibitors of NTE were not inert, because pretreating animals with nonaging inhibitors conferred protection against OPIDN from subsequent dosing with aging inhibitors, as long as the inhibition level from the pretreatment was $30% or more (Carrington, 1989; Johnson, 1970 Johnson, , 1974 Johnson and Read, 1993; Moretto et al., 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 622, "end": 640, "text": "(Carrington, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 641, "end": 654, "text": "Johnson, 1970", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 655, "end": 670, "text": "Johnson, , 1974", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 671, "end": 694, "text": "Johnson and Read, 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 695, "end": 716, "text": "Moretto et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Reconciling apparent conflicts between toxicological and genetic data"}, {"text": "However, it is also true that aging compounds necessarily result in longer-term inhibition than at least some nonaging inhibitors (e.g., carbamates) because aging inhibitors yield a highly stable organophosphylated NTE that cannot undergo spontaneous reactivation.

Nevertheless, prolonged inhibition of NTE has also been produced by various dosing regimens with nonaging inhibitors, such as repeated dosing with carbamates, single or repeated dosing with phosphinates, and single or repeated dosing with sulfonyl fluorides, such as PMSF.

This is especially so, considering that some of the nonaging phosphinate inhibitors exhibit high potency and selectivity for NTE.

Partial pathways of phospholipid metabolism in a neuron are shown. Choline (Cho) taken up by the cell is phosphorylated by choline kinase (CK) to phosphocholine (PCho), which is then converted to cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-Cho) via cytidine triphosphate phosphocholine cytidyltransferase (CCT) catalysis. The final step carried out in the Golgi involves addition of a diacylglycerol (DAG) to CDP-Cho catalyzed by choline phosphotransferase (CPT) to form phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). The PtdCho product forms a complex with a phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol transport protein (PITP), which conveys PtdCho to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), releasing uncomplexed PITP back into the cytoplasm. In Pathway (1), some fraction of the PtdCho being transported to the ER is deacylated by NTE to glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho) and two free fatty acids (FFA), releasing free PITP in the process. Pathway (2) involves deacylation of PtdCho in the ER to GroPCho +2 FFA. Pathway (3) depicts hydrolysis of PtdCho by a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPtdCho), which is then further degraded by NTE to GroPCho + FFA. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) in the ER is transported via a PITP to the Golgi, where it is phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol kinases (PIK) to various phosphorylated PtdIns species (PtdIns-P), which help regulate the constitutive secretory pathway and axonal transport.

Ultimately, the cause of this axonal resiliency was found to be a mutation, aptly named Wallerian degeneration slow (Wld S ). The discovery was serendipitous, as the mutation arose spontaneously and permitted detection coincidentally only after becoming homozygous. The revelation of Wld S fundamentally changed our concept of Wallerian degeneration from a passive process to an active program of axonal self-destruction-a kind of local apoptosis confined to the axon (Gerdts et al., 2016) . Exposure to a neuropathic (aging) OP NTE inhibitor produces inhibited and aged NTE, which triggers Wallerian degeneration via inhibition of axonal transport and/or stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or associated kinase cascade pathways. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is a prosurvival factor continuously supplied to the axon via axonal transport; it blocks sterile alpha and toll-interleukin receptor (TIR) motif containing 1 (SARM1) from depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) levels. Activation of kinase cascades lowers NMNAT2 levels enabling SARM1 to deplete NAD + , leading to ATP depletion. The resulting energy crisis increases Ca 2+ concentrations from external and internal (ER and mitochondrial) sources, thereby activating calcium-activated neutral proteases (CANPs; calpains), which degrade axonal proteins resulting in axonal degeneration. Nonaging NTE inhibitors block formation of aged NTE, conferring protection against OPIDN by blocking initiation.

Disruption of axonal transport by injury, disease, or certain neurotoxic agents interrupts the supply of NMNAT2, which quickly leads to NAD + depletion, followed closely by loss of ATP. The resulting local energy crisis permits intra-axonal calcium levels to rise sharply, thereby activating calcium-activated neutral proteases (CANPs; calpains), which mediate destruction of the axon. Given its central role as a prosurvival factor that helps maintain axons in a healthy state (Gilley and Coleman, 2010) , NMNAT2 is tightly regulated by multiple pathways and processes including cAMP signaling, protein phosphorylation cascades, palmitoylation, and ubiquitin ligases (Geden and Deshmukh, 2016; Rosell and Neukomm, 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 542, "end": 569, "text": "(Coleman and Freeman, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1194, "text": "(Gilley and Coleman, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1384, "text": "(Geden and Deshmukh, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1410, "text": "Rosell and Neukomm, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF237"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "OP-induced Wallerian degeneration (OPIWAD)"}, {"text": "Complementary studies have identified prodegenerative factors and pathways, including sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor motifcontaining 1 (SARM1) and the p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade.

However, calcium entry and/or release of calcium from internal storage sites such as the ER and mitochondria could also occur during the initiation phase, even in toxic neuropathies that do not involve physical trauma to axons. For example, at 24 hours after a neuropathic dose of TOCP in hens, CANP activity was significantly elevated in sciatic nerve, and administration of the calcium-channel blocker, nimodipine, within 24 hours after TOCP was effective at normalizing CANP activity measured at 24 hours and 28 days post-TOCP.

These processes can operate on both sides of the opposing forces of prosurvival and prodegenerative pathways. For example, it is conceivable that organophosphylation and aging of NTE could serve as a signal to initiate Wallerian degeneration, as proposed previously, but not yet rigorously tested (Richardson, 1984) . Furthermore, chemical modification of NTE by nonaging adduction might confer protection against axonopathy by maintaining NMNAT2 levels or blocking activation of SARM1 or MAPK pathways (Walker et al., 2017) .

Nevertheless, solving its individual domains can be undertaken using X-ray and NMR techniques (Puthenveetil and Vinogradova, 2019) , and determining how its domains interact with each other can be approached by combining site-directed fluorescence, chemical crosslinking, isotope exchange, and mass spectrometry (Hodge et al., 2019; Raghuraman et al., 2019; Xiang et al., 2020) .

The upper reaction of AChE (shown in red) with an organophosphate first yields an inhibited enzyme resulting in cholinergic toxicity, treatable with atropine. Before the inhibited enzyme ages, reactivation is possible, so that 2-PAM can also be administered (Fig. 8). After aging occurs, AChE is still inhibited but cannot be reactivated; therefore, 2-PAM will be ineffective and treatment is limited to atropine alone (although anticonvulsants could be given if convulsions were present). The lower reaction with an organophosphinate yields an inhibited enzyme resulting in cholinergic toxicity. Aging cannot occur because of the stability of the carbon-phosphorus bonds; both atropine and 2-PAM can be given as treatments. Note that aging of AChE is depicted here as proceeding via S N 1 scission, yielding RH (Richardson and Makhaeva, 2014).

The upper reaction of NTE (shown in blue) with an organophosphate yields inhibited enzyme, but OPIDN does not result until after aging occurs. Currently, there is no specific treatment for OPIDN. The lower reaction with an organophosphinate produces inhibited enzyme. Aging cannot occur because of the stability of the carbon-phosphorus bonds; there is no OPIDN, but there is protection against a subsequent exposure to a neuropathic OP compound. Note that aging of NTE is thought to proceed via an S N 2 reaction with H 2 O, so that the R-group is displaced as ROH. Moreover, for most neuropathic NTE inhibitors, aging occurs within minutes, precluding postinhibitory treatment with reactivators (Clothier and Johnson, 1979, 1980; Kropp et al., 2004; Richardson and Makhaeva, 2014).

TOCP is metabolized by cytochromes P450 to a hydroxylated intermediate that undergoes internal cyclization with elimination of a cresyl group to form the active NTE inhibitor, CBDP. Inhibited NTE could then undergo aging via proposed alternative pathways with net loss of a saligenin (1) or cresyl (3) group. The aging reaction could stop after the first elimination or proceed with sequential loss of cresyl (2) or saligenin (4) to yield a final aged product with a phosphate group covalently attached to the NTE active site serine residue. (Carletti et al., 2013; Reinen et al., 2015). The (S)-isomer of CBDP is shown, as this enantiomer reacts faster with the catalytic domain of NTE (Wu and Casida, 1994); however, it is not yet known if the initial CBDP-NTE adduct has retained, inverted, or racemized stereochemistry.
