The diagnosis of BOS actually does not require histological confirmation, but is considered a surrogate physiological marker of the presence of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). The etiology of BOS is not completely understood, but there are several associated risk factors, including alloimmune-dependent risks such as acute allograft rejection, lymphocytic bronchitis/bronchiolitis, organizing pneumonia, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches, and nonalloimmune-dependent risks, such as primary graft dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, and numerous infectious agents (bacterial, fungal, and viral) (2) .",

Patients with acute onset of BOS typically have an irreversible steep decline in pulmonary function, and are more likely to have had multiple episodes of acute allograft rejection in the first 6 months after surgery, with the main cause of death being OB (3). Patients with chronic onset of BOS have a more indolent course, with acute allograft rejection not being a marker, inflammation from infection being more important, and OB playing a smaller role in the cause of death (3).",

There was no history of HLA mismatch at the time of the transplant. Her current immunosuppression therapy was tacrolimus 3 mg twice daily, mycophenolate 500 mg twice daily, and prednisone 5 mg daily with other medications including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and pancreatic enzyme supplementation.

A total of 32 (64%) patients had 49 symptomatic respiratory viral episodes, with documented infections including RSV (n = 8), influenza (n = 10), and parainfluenza (n = 1) (6). More recently, Hopkins and colleagues (7) reported that, in a cohort of 89 patients with respiratory viral infections, a significant percentage of patients with metapneumovirus (63%) and RSV (72%) developed graft dysfunction, with average declines in FEV 1 of 30 \u00b1 12.4% and 25.9 \u00b1 11.2%, respectively. Subsequently, BOS onset or progression occurred in no patients with human metapneumovirus compared with a total of 5 of 13 (38%) patients with RSV at 6 months (7). Of these 5 patients with BOS, each of them reportedly had graft dysfunction at the time of the diagnosis of RSV infection (7) . Of these, 3 of 5 patients with RSV initially recovered to baseline respiratory function after therapy but subsequently developed BOS, with a mean time to diagnosis of 11 weeks (7) .",

A myriad of abnormalities can be seen on CT imaging of the chest in BOS, including bronchiectasis, hyperlucency (air-trapping), mosaic pattern of attenuation, thickening of septal lines, or tree-in-bud (8) .

This case further illustrates that different phenotypes of BOS do exist, and the fact that acute or chronic phenotypes can occur at any time after lung transplantation. The aggressiveness of this disorder was even more impressive in the patient presented herein, as compared with the cases reported in the prospective study by Hopkins et al. (7) .

In 2005, community-acquired respiratory viruses were reported to be associated with the development of acute rejection and BOS in a small cohort of patients(5). A total of 50 of 100 (50%) patients developed a respiratory viral illness with 33 (33%) having a specific viral etiology identified, including rhinovirus (n = 9), coronavirus (n = 8), RSV (n = 6), influenza A (n = 5), parainfluenza (n = 4), and human metapneumovirus (n = 1). A specific viral etiology was identified in 7 of 8 patients with subsequent acute rejection, including rhinovirus (n = 4), coronavirus OC43 (n = 1), RSV (n = 1), and influenza A virus (n = 1) (5). Moreover, 9 patients experienced a 20% or greater decline inFEV 1 by 3 months, with 4 being positive for a respiratory virus (rhinovirus [n = 1], coronavirus [n = 2], and influenza A [n = 1])",
