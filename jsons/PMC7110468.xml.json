Although some characteristics of the study populations are different (such as the recruitment time and age distribution), the higher percentage of co-infections in patients with pneumonia compared with upper respiratory infections in the Veracruz study, might suggest that co-infections cause more severe disease, suggesting complementary interaction among these viruses. This is also suggested by the multivariate analysis, in which it was found that co-infections are a risk factor for severe pneumonia. These observations are consistent with those of other authors who have reported RSV co-infections to be associated with a more severe disease than infections caused by a single virus (Harada et al., 2013). However, whether the viral detection in nasal washes reflects the pathogen responsible for the lower respiratory disease or only reflects a nasopharyngeal commensal or asymptomatic infection is not known with certainty, particularly when highly sensitive molecular methods are used (Jansen et al., 2011).",

On the other hand, interpretation of the results provided by these assays requires further examination. Because of the increasing detection of some viruses, particularly rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and bocavirus in patients with pneumonia, their specific contribution to lower respiratory tract infections needs to be evaluated. A recent study compared the frequency of detection of respiratory viruses in patients with CAP to the frequency of detection in asymptomatic subjects (Self et al., 2016). RSV, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus were notably more frequent in children with CAP (26.6%, 15.1%, and 3.4%, respectively) than in asymptomatic children (1.9%, 1.5%, and 0%, respectively) (Self et al., 2016). In contrast, there were less striking differences in the detection of rhinoviruses (21.9% vs. 17.3% in patients with pneumonia and asymptomatic subjects, respectively) and coronaviruses (4.5% and 1.5% in patients with pneumonia and asymptomatic subjects, respectively). In fact, after multivariate regression analysis, rhinoviruses were found not to be significantly associated with the presence of pneumonia (Self et al., 2016). Similar results have been reported by others, who have detected respiratory viruses in a large proportion of children without pneumonia (Zar et al., 2016, Rhedin et al., 2015).",

Some of these have been shown consistently to increase the risk of severe infection, while others have shown inconsistent results among different studies. In this study, in addition to the presence of co-infection, an association was found between other factors and the risk of severe pneumonia: lack of breastfeeding, use of biomass for cooking, and daycare attendance. Lack of breastfeeding and indoor air pollution have consistently been associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection and were considered as definite risk factors in a meta-analysis published in 2013 (Jackson et al., 2013). In that report, parental smoking showed inconsistent results among studies and was considered as a likely risk factor for severe infection. In the present study it showed a protective effect, although there is no apparent explanation for this finding. Finally, daycare attendance was sporadically reported in association with severe infections and was considered a possible risk factor. Inadequate breastfeeding, indoor pollution, and second-hand smoke exposure have also been found to be risk factors for mortality in children with acute lower respiratory infections (Sonego et al., 2015).",
