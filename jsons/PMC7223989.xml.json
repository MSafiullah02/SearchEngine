            "text": "Mental health practitioners (e.g., counselors; psychotherapists) work in a culture of one-way caring (Guy 2000) in which they are required to demonstrate empathy, compassion and patience, without the expectation of receiving such care in return from their clients (Skovholt et al. 2001). To be effective in providing mental health services, practitioners must develop a professional alliance or working relationship with clients that maintains appropriate boundaries and levels of emotional or psychological involvement, and to do so consistently from one client to another (Skovholt and Trotter-Mathison 2011). Establishing and maintaining these one-way working relationships takes significant effort and energy (Skovholt and Trotter-Mathison 2011) placing practitioners at increased risk for negative outcomes such as stress (El-Ghoroury et al. 2012), burnout (Wityk 2003), and professional impairment (Harrison and Westwood 2009). Ironically, while helping clients move toward well-being, practitioners often can overlook their own needs (Barnett et al. 2007) and indeed may not have \u201clearned how to take the time to care and to nourish [themselves], having been trained to believe that this would be selfish\u201d (Sapienza and Bugental 2000, p. 459). As a result, engaging in self-care can often sit at the end of a practitioner\u2019s to-do list, rather than being made a priority.",

            "text": "Yet self-care, or attending to one\u2019s own holistic well-being, can be a pathway towards preventing negative outcomes such as burnout (Barnett et al. 2007). Experienced therapists support including self-care as a primary objective for mental health practitioners (Jennings and Skovholt 1999; Th\u00e9riault et al. 2015) and this should be recognized as a fundamental part of functioning in a helping career (Guy 2000). The practitioner is a \u201cpowerful but vulnerable tool in the caring process\u201d that requires attention and care (Sans\u00f3 et al. 2015, p. 204) in order to prevent not only practitioner ill-health (Butler et al. 2017; Stebnicki 2007), but also negative consequences for the clients they serve (Bearse et al. 2013). In fact, mental health practitioners have an ethical duty to provide responsible caring, maximizing benefits and minimizing harm for their clients. In order to provide effective care to their clients, practitioners must first be well themselves (Norcross and Guy 2007). To promote responsible caring, several regulating bodies have, therefore, included practitioner self-care in their code of ethics. For instance, section II.12 of the Canadian Code of Ethics for Psychologists (Canadian Psychological Association 2017) states that, in accordance with the Principle of Responsible Caring, members are to \u201cengage in self-care activities that help to avoid conditions (e.g., burnout, addictions) that could result in impaired judgment and interfere with their ability to benefit and not harm others\u201d. Regulatory bodies thus understand self-care as being an ethical obligation for the mental health professional.",

            "text": "Stress among mental health professionals has been a known issue for decades, since Freud (1937/1963) discussed the stressfulness of therapist uncertainty around the issue of therapeutic success. For example, psychologists experience stressors in relation to the heavy emotional demands associated with clients\u2019 presentations including client lack of improvement, symptom relapse, suicide ideation and attempts, aggressive or violent behaviours, as well as the practical demands related to paperwork, ethical practice, licensing, malpractice complaints, and professional isolation (Barnett et al. 2007). Bettney (2017) also identified the work-related issues of large caseloads and negative team environments as being additional stressors for mental health practitioners. Given the presence of such multiple stressors, it is no wonder that practitioners, including graduate trainees, report a high level of stress and distress (El-Ghoroury et al. 2012; McKinzie et al. 2006; Myers et al. 2012). For example, 73% of Australian psychology postgraduate trainees reported clinically significant levels of distress (Pakenham and Stafford-Brown 2012). To complicate matters, mental health practitioners may not be fully aware of the impact of these various profession-related stressors and so will be less likely to see the need to engage in preventative measures (Barnett et al. 2007), or to seek treatment once the stressors have taken a toll (El-Ghoroury et al. 2012). Research has shown that for trauma therapists, work-related stress is related to their use of avoidant coping strategies, such as denial (Killian 2008). Unfortunately, left unresolved, work stress can set the stage for more serious issues, such as burnout and professional impairment to emerge (Barnett et al. 2007; Clark et al. 2009).",

Burnout among mental health practitioners is more difficult to treat than general work stress (Dreison et al. 2018), highlighting the need for prevention or early treatment. Unfortunately, the prevalence of burnout among mental health professionals is significant. In one study, 13% of behavioral health providers were at risk of compassion fatigue or burnout (Sprang et al. 2007), while 49% of counselling or clinical trainees reported experiencing burnout (Kaeding et al. 2017). Burnout can lead to poor quality of life (Chang 2014) as it is associated with a variety of mental and physical health problems, including headaches, muscular pain, and depression (Ahola et al. 2007; Vl\u0103du\u0163 and K\u00e1llay 2010). In turn, practitioner burnout affects overall therapeutic effectiveness (Bearse et al. 2013), not only reducing the level of care provided by the practitioner, but potentially leading to more serious inappropriate behaviours that can be harmful to clients. For example, Rupert and Kent (2007) found that psychologists\u2019 emotional exhaustion and depersonalization of clients, two aspects of burnout, were related to practitioner over-involvement with clients and clients engaging in negative behaviours.",

The potential for professional impairment is particularly increased for practitioners who work in the field of trauma, and is known variously as \u201csecondary victimization\u201d (Figley 1988), \u201cvicarious traumatization\u201d (McCann and Pearlman 1990), \u201ccompassion fatigue\u201d (Figley 1995), and \u201cempathy fatigue\u201d (Stebnicki 1999). Vicarious traumatization, for example, has been recognized as a distinct occupational hazard for mental health professionals (Buchanan et al. 2006), as it can affect self-worth, identity, world view, basic beliefs, psychological needs, perception, and memory (Saakvitne 2002) and hinder or impair the practitioner\u2019s initiatives towards professional development, personal growth, and holistic well-being (Stebnicki 2007). This type of counsellor impairment can significantly compromise therapeutic work, and pose harm to clients (Johnson et al. 2018; Lawson 2007). Given that both practitioner and client well-being are at risk when mental health professionals experience burnout, it is vital that steps are taken to address this issue (Barnett and Cooper 2009). Unfortunately, research has shown that interventions in reaction to practitioner burnout seem to demonstrate limited or no positive impact on the mental health of practitioners (Van Dam et al. 2011), thus shifting the spotlight toward preventative measures as a more desirable action.",

While a lack of self-care is related to higher levels of burnout and secondary traumatic stress symptoms, a greater risk of health status decline, and the experience of stress (Butler et al. 2017; Mayorga et al. 2015; Santana and Fouad 2017), engagement in self-care is associated with greater well-being (Colman et al. 2016), lower levels of stress and negative affect, higher levels of positive affect, flourishing, self-rated academic, and clinical performance (Zahniser et al. 2017), compassion satisfaction (Butler et al. 2017), and quality of life (Goncher et al. 2013). Overall, engagement in career-sustaining behaviours is linked to a greater sense of personal accomplishment and a lesser tendency to depersonalize clients (Rupert and Kent 2007). In fact, experienced mental health practitioners, or those who might be called \u201cmaster therapists\u201d, refer to self-care as a key aspect of professional functioning. Jennings and Skovholt (1999) report that such master therapists prioritize self-care in their profession and take \u201cpreventative action to protect what they consider [to be] their most important therapeutic tool: themselves (p.7)\u201d. Further, Dorociak et al. (2017b) found that more experienced practitioners engage in more self-care behaviours and report less stress than practitioners who are early in their career.",

Barnett et al. (2007) encourage mental health professionals to view themselves as being vulnerable to the personal and professional stressors of their career, as it is only with this awareness that preventative measures are likely to be taken. When practitioners are aware of work stressors such as isolation (Barnett and Cooper 2009), they can make a conscious effort to behave in ways that overcome or avoid such stressors, such as by planning and participating in regular case consultations with colleagues.",

This awareness of the self is a conscious and continuous process (Harrison and Westwood 2009). Practitioners must be aware of the many dynamics operating in the therapy room, including what is happening within the client, within themselves, and within the therapeutic interaction between them (Sans\u00f3 et al. 2015; Williams et al. 2003). As psychotherapeutic work can involve resistant clients, slow change/growth, and discussing primarily negative content (Norcross and Guy 2007), it is important that mental health professionals notice when they are feeling drained and take action to replenish their mental health (Sans\u00f3 et al. 2015).",

The more self-aware a practitioner is, the more likely they are to recognize and attend to their needs (Norcross and Guy 2007), which in turn allows them to provide quality services (Lawson 2007). Essentially, \u201cthe better we know ourselves, the better we can know and be helpful to others\u201d (Silverman 2008, p. 92). It was found by Zahniser et al. (2017) that psychology doctoral students who demonstrated cognitive self-awareness engaged in more effective self-care than those who did not. Self-monitoring and awareness have also been related to practitioners experiencing lower levels of emotional exhaustion (Rupert and Kent 2007), burnout and compassion fatigue, a greater sense of gratification in their work, and an ability to maintain emotional balance in difficult situations (Sans\u00f3 et al. 2015). In contrast, a lack of self-awareness of issues of therapeutic process (e.g., countertransference) is linked to greater burnout (Chang 2014).",

Balance refers to distributing one\u2019s attention to various aspects of life, ensuring not to neglect important facets, and to maintaining a sense of equilibrium in both personal and professional realms, whereas imbalance occurs when satisfaction in one domain leads to negative outcomes in other domains (Sirgy and Wu 2009). Maintaining balance between different life domains is frequently recommended in the self-care literature (e.g., Backman 2004; Lee et al. 2009), while seeking balance within the work domain is also important (Harrison and Westwood 2009). Specifically, a resilient practitioner is one who can create balance between other- and self-care across life domains (Skovholt and Trotter-Mathison 2011). Research has shown that work-life imbalance (e.g., high case load; workaholism) is related to the experience of work stress and compassion fatigue (Killian 2008). Poor work-life balance has also been linked to exhaustion among mental health practitioners (Scanlan et al. 2013) and feelings of anxiety, stress, and being unsettled (Hill et al. 2016). In contrast, maintaining balance in life is related to lower levels of emotional exhaustion (Rupert and Kent 2007), greater career satisfaction (Rupert et al. 2012), and lower risk of burnout (Levin et al. 2017).",

Fostering attitudes and engaging in practices that promote healthy coping and ongoing growth can be thought of as forms of self-care as they promote well-being (Wise et al. 2012), and can be helpful in the prevention of negative outcomes (Knapp et al. 2017).",

For example, it can be riddled with inconsistency, unanticipated challenges such as clients in crisis, and disappointments including slow progression or lack of therapeutic success, which often are not within the therapist\u2019s control (Negash and Sahin 2011; Smith and Moss 2009). Confronted with such demands, having an inflexible coping response style can have a negative impact on practitioners\u2019 well-being and growth. Kaeding et al. (2017) found that counselling trainees who hold rigid, perfectionistic expectations about their performance report experiencing greater burnout. High performance standards in combination with low self-efficacy is also related to problematic emotion regulation, neuroticism, and high cortisol levels (Richardson et al. 2014). What complicates matters is that mental health practitioners essentially are required to suppress or control their emotional reactions and limit self-disclosure in order not to interfere with the therapeutic process (Guy 2000). While some research suggests expressive suppression may be beneficial in the short-term (Myers et al. 2012), it has also been associated with negative outcomes for the therapist, such as increased anxiety and depression (Moore et al. 2008), and to higher levels of stress (Finlay-Jones et al. 2015).",

Specifically, practitioners who reappraise events report more positive and less negative emotions as well as better interpersonal functioning. In addition, psychologists and post-graduate psychologist trainees who hold an attitude of self-compassion report fewer difficulties in emotion regulation (Finlay-Jones et al. 2015). Having an attitude of self-compassion and acceptance helps therapists to recognize and address their professional limitations (Patsiopoulos and Buchanan 2011). In fact, engaging in professional development on a regular basis is recommended for therapist self-care (Knapp et al. 2017), and is increasingly being made mandatory by professional associations. Other practices that can promote flexibility are setting and reappraising goals (Wityk 2003), engaging in expressive writing or journaling (Baddeley and Pennebaker 2011; Warren et al. 2010), and engaging in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Rudaz et al. 2017).",

Psychologists often recommend a balanced diet and physical activity to their clients (Burton et al. 2010); however, it is unclear how dedicated they are to this aspect of their own self-care (Norcross and Guy 2007) \u2013 even though maintaining a healthy lifestyle is ranked as the fourth most important self-care practice by experienced therapists (Th\u00e9riault et al. 2015). In addition to maintaining a balanced diet and attending to hydration on a daily basis, it is recommended that mental health practitioners exercise regularly (Harrison and Westwood 2009). Empirical research on helping professionals and general populations highlight the psychological benefits of physical health. For example, medical students who exercise, regularly reported less exhaustion and greater professional efficacy (Wolf and Rosenstock 2017), and lower rates of burnout and higher quality of life (Dyrbye et al. 2017). Physical health may serve as a protective factor in relation to the well-being of practitioners. For example, Gerber et al. (2014) found that undergraduate students who engaged in vigorous physical activity experienced less stress and pain and fewer sleep problems and depressive symptoms at stressful times than those who did not. In another study, individuals who had moderate to high fitness scores reported fewer symptoms of burnout and depression than those who had low scores (Gerber et al. 2013). In contrast, one study actually found a positive relationship between exercise and the experience of stress among clinical graduate students (McKinzie et al. 2006). Perhaps in regard to the study, rather than contributing to stress levels, individuals may have engaged in more exercise as a means of coping under times of greater stress.",

Given that isolation is a known risk factor for burnout among mental health practitioners (Stebnicki 2007), research has focused on the role of personal and professional social support in self-care. Practitioners rely on many sources of support, including peer support, individual and/or group supervision, involvement in professional associations, colleague assistance programs, and personal therapy (Barnett et al. 2007). While some studies have suggested that social support is of little importance to mental health professionals (e.g., Stevanovic and Rupert 2004), others have found it to be a significant factor in practitioners\u2019 well-being. For example, Killian (2008) found that social support was the most significant predictor of compassion satisfaction among trauma therapists. Strong social support is related to lower levels of perceived stress (Myers et al. 2012), while a lower level of personal (e.g., family) and professional (e.g., collegial) support is linked to greater psychological distress (Nelson et al. 2001).",

Psychology graduate students often more frequently seek out personal support and rate these relationships as most effective in addressing personal and professional stress (El-Ghoroury et al. 2012; Nelson et al. 2001). Satisfaction with personal support is linked to greater self-esteem, psychological adaption (i.e., flexibility), and professional functioning, lower anxiety and depression, and less use of avoidance coping among clinical trainees (Kuyken et al. 2003). In contrast, Rupert and Kent (2007) found that psychologists who discussed their work frustrations with spouses and colleagues reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion. Although this finding might suggest a negative spillover of work stress into the personal life domain, it may also reveal that psychologists often seek support from outside sources when they are exhausted from work demands. Finally, personal therapy is recommended as a method of self-care (Th\u00e9riault et al. 2015). Unfortunately, there are many barriers to mental health practitioners seeking therapy, with concerns about confidentiality, cost, and time being identified as the most common obstacles (Dearing et al. 2005). One study revealed that 59% of professional psychologists did not seek therapy despite knowing it would be to their benefit (Bearse et al. 2013).",

In fact, Merriman (2015) argues that ideally supervision should include the development and monitoring of self-care plans for supervisees. In addition to supporting supervisee competence (Bradshaw et al. 2007), supervision can help serve to identify gaps in training, provide checks on caseload and work-life balance, direct career development, encourage self-care, and serve as a support when supervisees face professional hazards (Pack 2015). Clinical psychology graduate students report being most satisfied with their supervisors when they receive advice on self-care and work-life balance (Peluso et al. 2011). In turn, work-based social support, such as supervision, helps trainees use adaptive coping styles (Kuyken et al. 2003).",

Experienced therapists describe how a sense of spiritual connection sustains their professional efforts and helps to dispel feelings of isolation and despair (Harrison and Westwood 2009).

Experienced (master) therapists interviewed by Jennings and Skovholt (1999) also noted how the practice of spirituality was essential to their mental health and emotional well-being. Mindfulness (Hemanth and Fisher 2015) and making meaning in work (Norcross and Guy 2007) are two main practices that have been linked to practitioner spiritual self-care. Other spiritual practices utilized by mental health professionals include prayer (Moore et al. 2011) and spending time in nature (Grafanaki 2005; Patsiopoulos and Buchanan 2011).",

Expert therapists have identified mindfulness as a way to enhance clinician awareness, acceptance of limitations, and clarity about self in relation to others (Harrison and Westwood 2009). Counselling students who receive mindfulness training report greater physical, emotional, and interpersonal well-being (Christopher and Maris 2010) and that these effects continue as graduates transition into the professional workforce (Christopher et al. 2011). Mindfulness training also helps clinical trainees cope more effectively with difficult experiences (Hemanth and Fisher 2015). Mindfulness-based stress-reduction is related to lower levels of perceived stress, negative affect, state and trait anxiety, rumination, and higher levels of positive affect and self-compassion (Shapiro et al. 2007), as well as to improved clinical skills such as empathy that in turn may reduce the risk of harm to clients (Leppma and Young 2016; Schomaker and Ricard 2015). Professional psychotherapists who use mindfulness report improvements in their levels of attention, self-awareness, self-compassion, capacity for empathy, and ability to tolerate difficult emotions (Keane 2014).",

The objective of meaning-making is to reduce the discrepancy between the appraised meaning of a situation and the individual\u2019s global beliefs and goals (Park 2010). As a deliberate practice (Park 2010), meaning-making serves as another pathway to self-care for mental health practitioners. This process encourages practitioners to situate their stressors within their overarching values and belief system, recall their purpose of working in this field, and connect with the transcendent or the ultimate meaning of their work. As Norcross and Guy (2007) explain, \u201cto be present at the moment of significant insight or decision in the life of a client is a spiritual experience that connects the psychotherapist to the flow of life and creation\u201d (p. 21).",

Pakenham (2017) proposes that awareness of one\u2019s values can play a key role in motivating clinical psychology trainees to engage in behaviours that are fulfilling and that the connection with one\u2019s personal and professional values plays a role in the maintenance of well-being. Norcross et al. (2005) encourage practitioners to revisit what initially led them to choose a career in mental health in order to reawaken their sense of purpose and thus revitalize their spirit for this field of work. Specifically, practitioners who practice gratitude and internalize the rewards of working in mental health move toward positive well-being and away from negative outcomes such as burnout (Norcross and Guy 2007). Mason (2016) suggests that meaning-making can interrupt therapists\u2019 experiences of compassion fatigue and burnout. Having a sense of meaning and existential well-being in relation to one\u2019s work is associated with lower levels of depression (Eakman 2016), less stress and more social support (Calicchia and Graham 2006), greater career satisfaction (Rupert et al. 2012), joy (Pooler et al. 2014), and less burnout and fewer psychiatric symptoms (Currier et al. 2013). For example, neurology residents and fellows who reported meaning in their work were more likely to experience career satisfaction and be at lower risk for burnout (Levin et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Although there is much research in the area of the self-care of mental health practitioners, limitations exist in this field of study. First, while experienced practitioners seem to endorse all of the areas mentioned in this review (Norcross and Guy 2007), research has focused primarily on awareness, balance, social support, and mindfulness and less so on flexibility, meaning-making, and physical health. This imbalance in research focus may reflect a lack of clear definition for the construct under study (e.g., flexibility). Some areas of self-care can overlap (e.g., flexibility and balance) making it difficult to distinguish their unique contributions to well-being. For example, balance can be achieved through the perception of meaning in occupation (Eakman 2016), while mindfulness as a technique promotes awareness (Rudaz et al. 2017). Second, some constructs may be simply taken for granted as an aspect of self-care as they are relevant to the well-being of all persons not just mental health practitioners (e.g., physical health). Third, self-care most commonly is studied in relation to the well-being of practitioner trainees such as graduate students in clinical psychology programs. While this population represents individuals who are actively providing mental health services, it may be somewhat biased in that graduate students tend to experience higher levels of stress and other negative symptoms due to the multiple demands of this career phase (Myers et al. 2012).",

While practitioners\u2019 use of flexibility and spirituality (specifically mindfulness) would benefit from further research, the general findings from this literature review suggests that including areas of awareness, balance, flexibility, physical health, social support, and spirituality in self-care training would allow for a holistic education on the topic. Encouraging specific practices that fit within each of these categories and yet meet the unique needs of practitioners would be optimal. Longitudinal studies would provide a better understanding of the nature and efficacy of self-care (Pakenham 2017) across practitioners\u2019 career trajectory. Meta-analyses of various self-care practices would also help advance understanding of which techniques are most effective and should be prioritized in future research and training.",

The current literature suggests that a proactive stance toward self-care can help reduce negative outcomes experienced by mental health practitioners (Goncher et al. 2013), and improve the care of clients (Schomaker and Ricard 2015), both being ethical imperatives in the profession. The vast increase in published literature on self-care, and its inclusion in multiple codes of ethics demonstrates that a positive shift toward self-care has already begun, with, for example, two self-care scales being recently developed (Dorociak et al. 2017a; Santana and Fouad 2017).
