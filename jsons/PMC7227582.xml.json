To date, there is no specific or effective therapies approved for treatment of this fatal disease (3). In many countries, the public health services are being overwhelmed by a rapid rise in new cases of COVID-19, resulting in a high severity or mortality of this infectious disease (4,5). Thus, clinicians should identify the risk factors of COVID-19, pay attention to the risk factors of critical disease and death in confirmed cases, and then take appropriate interventions, which may help to prevent infection, enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death.",

            "text": "The latest systematic review reported that hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with a higher risk of severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 (6). However, patients with these comorbidities are likely treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which could upregulate the expression of ACE2 receptor in animal-based studies (7,8). Because ACE2 is used by coronaviruses as a functional receptor for their entrance into the cells (9), there is concern about the potential of an increased risk of COVID-19 positive among those with ACEI/ARB use (10). Conversely, there evidence from various acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) animal models that exogenous ACE2 supplementation can reduce inflammation and increase oxygenation (11). Epidemiological studies also observed ACEI/ARB use may reduce the risk of pneumonia in general population (12,13). These observations have led to concerns that whether ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with the risk or progress of COVID-19. In order to provide more accurate evidences on this topic, we searched the relevant literatures and conducted a meta-analysis. Thus, the aims of the present study were as follows: (1) to determine whether use of ACRI/ARB is associated with an increase in likelihood of viral infectivity; (2) to investigate whether there are differences in severity and mortality between ACRI/ARB users and non- ACRI/ARB users; (3) and, in particular, to evaluate whether ACRI/ARB exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality when compared to non-ACRI/ARB antihypertensive drug exposure. Our findings provide vital guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection.",

To provide a quantitative estimate of the association of ACEI/ARB use with critical or mortal risk in COVID-19 patients, the ORs (most adjusted, if available) and the corresponding 95% CIs were abstracted from published articles. When the ORs were not given, they were calculated from tabular data. Statistical heterogeneity of the included studies was calculated by \u03c72 test and the I2 statistic; an I2 of >50% or a P < 0.05 for the Q-statistic was considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity (15). A random-effects model of DerSimonian-Laird rather than a fixed effects model was used for comparison due to the between-study variance (16). Egger\u2019s regression test was employed to evaluate the publication bias (17). Publication bias was not formally assessed because each meta-analysis included fewer than 10 studies.

However, ACEI/ARB was widely used among these patients, which raises the concerns about the potential advantages and disadvantages of ACEI/ARB use (33). SARS-CoV-2 binds to the extracellular domain of the transmembrane ACE2 receptor to gain entry into host cells (9). While ACEI and ARB have been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression in animal studies (7,8), it is reasonable to hypothesize that hypertensive patients taking these drugs may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Contrary to this hypothesis, our analysis did not provide evidence that patients should stop or substitute the ACEI or ARB medications previously prescribed. This may be result for two reasons. First, the effects of ACEI/ARB on the level of human plasma ACE2 are inconsistent (34), and no studies evaluate their effect on lung-specific expression of ACE2 (35). To be relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effect on ACE2 would need to be present on respiratory epithelium. Second, beta blockers are identified to prevent the ACE2 activity (36), which could underestimate the risk of ACEI/ARB-associated COVID-19.",

Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV subsequently reduce ACE2 expression in host cells, resulting in activation of RAS, which in turn caused severe acute lung injury and exacerbated pneumonia progression (11). According this theory, RAS inhibitor use may improve the clinical outcomes of the patients with COVID-19. In our overall analysis, ACEI/ARB exposure is not associated with a lower risk of severity or mortality. This may be explained by the drug indication. The latest systematic review (6) has identified that COVID-19 patients with hypertension and CVD faced a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition. Several studies (20,22,25,30) included patients without hypertension and CVD in non-ACEI/ARB group, which may underestimate the protective effect of ACEI/ARB use in COVID-19 patients. Further analysis limited to studies only included patients with drug indication found a lower risk of mortality among those with ACEI/ARB use. This finding is further reinforced by a relatively lower but significant risk observed in patients with hypertension.",

The key strength of our meta-analysis lies in its large sample size and comprehensive search. With the accumulating evidence and enlarged sample size we have enhanced statistical power to provide more precise and reliable risk estimates. In our included studies, more than 19000 COVID case were included in the severity and mortality analysis. Furthermore, we conducted additional analyses to control for confounding by indication.",

Previous studies have reported that sex, age, smoking, and diabetes greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. However, these potential confounders considered in the most of included studies. Future research should report analyses stratified by possible risk factors that fully adjust for potential confounders in order to rule out alternative explanations. Second, the number of eligible high-quality studies was small, which may have influenced the accuracy of our results. Third, the measurement of ACEI/ARB exposure was through medical record review. Therefore, the method that collected the exposure information was unreliable, which may have influenced our findings. Fourth, although only mild heterogeneity was observed in severity analyses, the existence of clinical heterogeneity would be expected to lead to a degree of statistical heterogeneity in the results. The definition of COVID-19 severity and outcomes assessment were inconsistent among the included studies. Fifth, the study population of present review was mainly from hospital, which is susceptible to selection bias.",
