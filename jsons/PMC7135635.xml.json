From early October 2013, Saudi Arabia will be hosting millions of Muslims from different parts of the world who travel to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Hadj. However, since November 2012, Saudi Arabia has also hosted a new fatal viral infection: the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",
