To intervene successfully, disease surveillance systems need to provide a continuous, accurate, and near real-time overview of a population's health. Surveillance systems must be sensitive in terms of their ability to detect outbreaks and other changes in community health status over time, and they must be flexible in adapting novel diagnostic technology to changing health intelligence needs. Given the increasing pace of international travel and globalization and the threat of intentional outbreaks, surveillance activities need to extend beyond the monitoring of disease burden to include the capacity to quickly recognize unusual, unexpected, or unexplained disease patterns. Because many emerging infectious agents are zoonotic,25 it is also important to integrate veterinary disease reporting networks into systems that monitor diseases of humans, as emphasized by the One Health Initiative.26\n",

Additional enhancements to the surveillance effort include development of the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (PulseNet) as an early warning system for foodborne diseases, the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, strengthened surveillance for emerging diseases (e.g., West Nile encephalitis, seasonal and pandemic influenza), and surveillance for outbreaks that might be due to acts of bioterrorism.",

Countries were required to complete an assessment of their core surveillance and response capacities within 2 years and then have 3 years to implement the required measures for compliance. The revised IHR are much broader in scope than the preceding regulations. The IHR define a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as any extraordinary public health event (all hazards) that constitutes a public health risk to other countries through international spread, and potentially requires a coordinated international response. State parties to the IHR are required to notify WHO about events that may constitute a PHEIC, which includes mandatory reporting of four diseases (smallpox, SARS, wild-type poliovirus infections, and novel subtypes of influenza) and an assessment of all other threats using a prescribed algorithm. WHO makes the final assessment of whether an event is a PHEIC. Of the many events reported by countries to WHO since IHR implementation in June 2007, pandemic H1N1 influenza was the first PHEIC declared by the WHO Director General in May 2009.",

The best defense against these mobile and resilient pathogens is timely and reliable infectious disease intelligence obtained through global public health surveillance.32 The international community has made important strides in developing networks for detecting and reporting infectious disease events and enhancing capacity for clinical and laboratory surveillance. Continued commitment and support are needed to optimize these mechanisms to improve the timely detection of unusual disease events, strengthen the ability to share disease intelligence, and inform prevention and containment efforts.",
