            "text": "Pneumonia, an acute infection in the lung parenchyma leading to an abnormal pulmonary function, is the most common infection during hospitalization [1]. The classifications of pneumonia include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and nursing home-associated pneumonia (NHAP) [2]. CAP refers to pneumonia acquired outside of hospitals; HAP describes infections acquired in the hospital setting; VAP is a subtype of HAP that occurs when receiving mechanical ventilation; NHAP is defined as infection acquired in an extended-care facility. In the United States, an estimated 5.6 million patients are diagnosed with CAP annually, with 1.1 million requiring hospital admission. The mortality rate of CAP outpatients is in the range of 1%\u20135%, with 12% of patients requiring hospitalization, and as much as 40% of patients requiring admission to intensive care units (ICUs) [3], [4]. Although the clinical presentations are often similar, pneumonia can also be classified into typical or atypical types according to the differences in pathogens. The typical type of pneumonia is usually caused by bacteria such as streptococcus and staphylococcus, while the atypical type is caused by the influenza virus, mycoplasma, chlamydia, legionella, adenovirus, or other unidentified microorganisms [5]. Ideally, as an early and definitive diagnosis can be achieved by verifying the specific pathogens involved, subsequent treatment with specific antibiotics can improve the prognosis of pneumonia. However, a rapid and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia remains challenging.",

Depending on the various types of pathogens involved, pneumonia may be accompanied with different features. According to the clinical guidelines, the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia involves the use of chest radiography to detect the presence of pulmonary infiltrates. However, chest radiography is not sensitive enough for detecting specific pulmonary infiltrates and the early course of the disease. Up to one-third of possible pneumonia diagnoses may be missed when using chest radiography [7]. In addition, certain chronic diseases, such as congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy, can also interfere with the results. Laboratory tests, including leukocyte count, sputum Gram stain, 2 sets of blood cultures, and urine antigens, can also help provide a definitive diagnosis and guide therapeutic decision making. However, the results of these tests on patients with suspected CAP vary because of the uncertain quality of specimens and the use of antimicrobial drugs. A positive blood culture may have no correlation with the severity of the illness or outcome [6]. Such uncertainty and time-consuming limitation may obscure accurate diagnoses and delay the beginning of treatment. Therefore, innovative approaches for identifying the indicators of biological state of pneumonia are eager to be achieved.",

Although these methods are highly specific, the result is affected by the usage of antimicrobial drugs and the sensitivity is poor. The application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in species-specific genes and conserved bacterial DNA sequence-based diagnostic tests has been developed [11], [12]. In contrast to negative sputum cultures, most samples from patients infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae and receiving antibiotics can still be accurately evaluated by applying PCR [13]. Examination by using a real-time (RT) PCR technique can reduce the time consumption associated with culture methods and permit early diagnosis. In a prospective study in Denmark, a quantitative multiplex PCR method was evaluated by detecting S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF). Both the sensitivities and specificities for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae can reach 80%\u201390% in a cut-off of 105\n genomic copies/mL for clinical positivity. In a previous study where patients had taken antibiotics prior to sampling, 36% of S. pneumoniae infections and 53% of H. influenza infections could be detected using PCR, whereas only 6% and 20%, respectively, could be detected in culture. In addition, identifying the S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis in CSF can achieve 100% sensitivity and specificity [14]. Pathogens detected by PCR are not found by using the culture methods, and vice versa, suggesting that PCR can provide additional information compared to current culture methods [14], [15]. PCR results may show the existence of specific infectious pathogens, which, however, is not considered the \u201cillness\u201d of pneumonia.",

The concentration of endotoxins in BALF has exhibited a relationship with the quantity of Gram negative bacteria in VAP. An amount greater than or equal to 6 EU/mL can be used to distinguish patients with Gram-negative or -positive bacterial pneumonia (sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 87%; positive predictive value, 67%; negative predictive value, 95%). Determining the concentration of endotoxins in BALF can facilitate the diagnosis of Gram-negative pneumonia for further antibiotic therapies, although a Gram stain of BALF can provide the same information [16], [17].",

In a study of 24 patients with CAP, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were detected in most of the patients on admission and decreased significantly thereafter, and IL-6 presented as a prognostic marker in correlation with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores on admission.

CRP is synthesized in hepatocytes through the induction of IL-6, although other cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, are also involved. In healthy human adults, the concentration of CRP is lower than 3 mg/L [27], and the secretion of CRP starts from between 4 and 6 h after stimulation, doubling every 8 h, and reaching the maximum value after 36\u201350 h. In the existence of stimuli, CRP production can still be evaluated at even more than 1000-fold of the reference value. Once the stimulus is removed, the CRP value falls rapidly with a half-life of 19 h [25], [28].",

            "text": "Serum CRP has been reported in some studies regarding its role in identifying patients with pneumonia. The elevation of CRP levels is both sensitive and specific for predicting pneumonia, and its diagnostic performance is superior to white blood cell counts or erythrocyte sedimentation rates [29]. In a prospective hospital-based CAP study, serum CRP levels were elevated above 50 mg/L in all of the patients and above 100 mg/L in 75% of the patients on the day of hospital admission. Patients who had received antibiotics prior to hospital admission exhibited significantly lower CRP levels [30]. In radiologically confirmed pneumonia, the specificity of CRP at a cut-off value of 100 mg/L in predicting pneumonia can reach 91.2% [31]. Serum CRP values are significantly higher in CAP patients, compared to healthy controls and suspected CAP patients, and high CRP values are suggestive of severity in determining the appropriateness of inpatient care. In addition, serum CRP levels have been demonstrated to be greatly increased by most severe bacterial infections, but only modestly increased by viral respiratory tract infections [29], [33]. High CRP values are especially present in patients with pneumonia caused by S. pneumonia or Legionella pneumophila\n[32]. The single parameter of CRP concentration greater than 150 mg/L appears to be highly specific for a bacterial infection. Combination with other markers did not improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating patients with a bacterial or viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), compared with CRP alone [34]. By contrast, some previous studies have inferred that CRP lacks specificity for bacterial infection, and a high CRP level could be due to other inflammatory conditions [9]. The serum level of CRP may largely depend on the status of systemic inflammatory responses rather than the direct outcomes of the disease.",

However, PTX3 exhibited different features from short pentraxins in its structure, gene location, and cellular source, inducing stimuli and ligand recognition. The structure of PTX3 is related to CRP and SAP, but contains an unrelated long amino-terminal domain coupled to the carboxyl-terminal pentraxin domain [23]. The genes of short pentraxins are located on chromosome 1, whereas PTX3 is located on chromosome 3q25. Unlike CRP that is produced in the liver by the stimulation with the secondary cytokine, IL-6, PTX3 is induced by the Toll-like receptor engagement and primary cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in various cell types, particularly mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells [38], [39]. IL-6 does not induce PTX3 production. Taken together, these findings imply that the serum PTX3 level may directly reflect the severity of infections and is less affected by other inflammatory conditions.",

PTX3 levels not only correlated with clinical scores but also reflected the severity of disease, and higher levels of PTX3 were associated with an unfavorable outcome [40]. In severe leptospirosis patients, the plasma PTX3 levels were also associated with the severity and mortality of diseases, while CRP levels could not be used to differentiate the severe from the severest cases [41]. In studies on patients with meningococcal disease, high plasma concentrations of PTX3 were seen at admission and correlated to patients with shock, whereas CRP level at admission was negatively correlated. PTX3 level was not correlated with mortality or days spent in the ICU [42]. In bacteremia patients, PTX3 values on Days 1\u20134 were markedly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors and showed 72% sensitivity and 81% specificity for fatal disease at a cut-off level of 15 ng/mL. PTX3 showed a higher prognostic value compared to CRP in the prognostic stratification of bacteremia patients [43], [44].

In the process of microbial infection, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 can promote CALC-I gene expression and increase the release of PCT into circulation from parenchymal tissues, such as the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After a septic stimulus, PCT protein production of parenchymal cells can be detected after 10 h with a half-life of approximately 22\u201335 h [28], [46]. In addition, the production of PCT may also be markedly increased under noninfectious conditions such as trauma, surgery, burns, heat stroke, and rejection after transplantation [28], [47]. PCT levels are attenuated by the cytokines released in response to a viral infection. The prohormone requires further post-translational processing to form a mature type of hormone, and may demonstrate distinct biological activities. In a hamster septic model, the concentration of PCT was rapidly evaluated and peaked at 12 h after induction of sepsis. Because the exogenous PCT significantly increased the mortality rate, a prophylactic blockade of PCT attenuated the lethal effects of sepsis. The increase in circulation of PCT levels may exacerbate the mortality rate, and diminishing the production of PCT increases the survival [47]. It inferred that PCT may play a detrimental role in systemic inflammation. In addition, the changes in circulating PCT levels may represent the severity of infections and may be used as a prognostic marker. Therefore, the circulating PCT level has been examined to monitor the progression of severe sepsis, septic shock, and the response to antimicrobial therapy [48].",

Several studies have reported the value of using PCT levels in managing CAP. It has been suggested that rising PCT can facilitate early identification of the risk of mortality in critically ill patients [49]. From the results of two randomized prospective studies, in 373 CAP patients from a total of 545 patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infections, PCT presented a higher diagnostic accuracy in differentiating CAP from other diagnoses than did CRP or the total leukocyte count. The PCT levels also demonstrated higher accuracy in predicting bacteremia and the severity of CAP [50]. In a VAP cohort study with sequential measurement of PCT and CRP levels, both PCT and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with confirmed VAP, and PCT demonstrated higher accuracy. However, the PCT and CRP levels in BALF cannot help differentiate between confirmed and non-confirmed VAP [51]. In addition to discriminating the accurate diagnosis of pneumonia, PCT levels demonstrated their prognostic value in CAP patients [52], [53]. In a study where the PCT, CRP, WBC, and CRB-65 scores in 1671 CAP patients were all determined on admission and followed-up for 28 days to ascertain mortality, a similar prognostic accuracy of the CRB-65 score showed that PCT levels on admission can predict the severity and outcome of CAP. PCT levels show a higher prognostic accuracy than do those of CRP or leukocyte count, and provide independent identification of patients at low risk of death [53]. By using PCT levels, Christ-Crain et al. reduced antibiotic exposure in patients with CAP from a median of 12 to 5 days in a randomized trial investigating the guidance of antibiotic treatment duration in CAP [54]. The dynamic levels of PCT may present a guide for the choice and duration of the antibiotic therapies.",

AM is expressed in many tissues including the adrenal medulla, atrium, lung, pancreas, and small intestine [56]. In addition to its potent vasodilating activities, AM can modulate the complement activation to perform bactericidal activities [57]. In cultured vascular smooth-muscle and endothelial cells, AM production can be largely induced by LPS, TNF, and IL-1 stimulation. By contrast, AM also suppresses IL-1\u03b2-induced TNF-\u03b1 secretion and gene transcription in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts [56], [58]. The regulation of AM production may be involved in a feedback loop during inflammatory responses. The serum AM levels might reflect the severity of infections. However, AM is rapidly cleared from circulation. Determining the level of Pro-AM can alternatively represent the levels of the rapidly degraded active peptide AM [44].",

On admission, it was also significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors [59]. In a prospective observational study, Pro-AM levels were correlated with the severity of CAP and could predict the mortality on admission. Combining the PSI and Pro-AM levels increased the prognostic accuracy to predict the risk stratification of CAP patients [60]. In pediatric CAP patients, the Pro-AM level was also related to the development of complications during hospitalization [61]. Although Pro-AM level can help distinguish the severity and risk of CAP, it shows a high coverage of the concentration ranges, and the cut-off values in pneumonia still need to be evaluated.",

In microbial sepsis patients and an animal model of LPS-induced shock, TREM was upregulated in the peritoneal neutrophils [62], [63]. Silencing of TREM in vivo in a fecal peritonitis mouse model blunted the inflammatory response and increased mortality. These effects occur with an impairment of bacterial clearance that was related to marked inhibition of the neutrophil oxidative burst [64]. Raising TREM expression levels may promote neutrophil activities in eliminating microorganisms. Once the TREM binds to its ligand and is activated through the association with the adapter protein, DAP12, it can further induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and TNF-\u03b1 to induce neutrophil degranulation in response to infections [65]. TREM is highly expressed in neutrophils caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Bartonella henselae, and Aspergillus fumigatus infections. This phenomenon has not been observed in samples from patients under non-infectious inflammatory conditions [62]. This indicates that the upregulation of the membrane-bound and the soluble form (S-TREM) of TREM may be specifically involved in infectious diseases.",

By contrast, in a study that was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of S-TREM in BALF of ICU patients as a rapid diagnostic test for VAP, the S-TREM levels in BALF could not discriminate for VAP, although the confirmed VAP patients exhibited higher concentrations of S-TREM in BALF than did the unconfirmed VAP patients [67]. In another prospective cohort study, the mean S-TREM concentration was higher in confirmed VAP patients, but this finding lacks statistical significance. Patients with alveolar hemorrhage had the greatest values for S-TREM concentration, while a cut-off value for S-TREM greater than 200 pg/mL yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 42.1% and a specificity of 75.6% for definite VAP [68]. In addition to being measured in BALF, the serum levels of S-TREM were also reported with significant elevation in pneumonia, COPD, and asthma exacerbations [69]. The levels of S-TREM may correlate with an inflammation condition but appear less accurate as a sole marker for pneumonia. Therefore, S-TREM levels must be further combined with other markers for accurate evaluation.",

A research group in Taiwan applied 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify the differential levels of haptoglobin, immunoglobulin kappa chain, apolipoprotein A-I, and transthyretin in the plasma protein profiles of children with different severities of pneumococcal pneumonia [91].",

In a study aiming to compare S. pneumonia with other microbe-mediated pneumonia, the urinary metabolomic profile of pneumococcal pneumonia patients was significantly different from that of patients with viral and other bacterial forms of pneumonia [92]. The results from a metabolomic analysis of severe childhood pneumonia in Gambia also clearly distinguished severe pneumonia patients from community controls. Those identified metabolites are related to the host response to infection through antioxidant, inflammatory, and antimicrobial pathways, as well as the energy metabolism [93]. These findings indicate that NMR-based analysis of metabolites in urine may provide new information for the diagnosis and etiology of pneumonia.",

These potential biomarkers may provide different clinical values in detecting pneumonia according to their original biological features. First, identifying microorganisms and their derivatives can help ascertain the etiology of pneumonia. Second, evaluating the inflammation mediators and response proteins can provide information on the degree of immunity to combat pulmonary pathogens that cause the disease, and can facilitate pneumonia management. Finally, the circulating stress-sensing proteins that reflect the condition of illness can be useful in stratifying risks and predicting prognosis. However, due to the heterogeneity of pneumonia patients, who vary in age, sex, comorbid conditions, and the development of complications, the clinical cut-off value of these potential biomarkers must be determined further. In conclusion, the implication of these biomarkers should be considered complementary to routine clinical and laboratory features to improve decision making regarding pneumonia.",
