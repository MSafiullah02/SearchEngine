Women and children are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, so avoidance of routine hospital visits is recommended by the National Health Commission of China. However, delayed treatment of rapid and progressive newborn diseases can occur. Neonatal out-patient visits are of utmost important to those with hyperbilirubinemia. For unrecognized and accelerated severe early neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, appropriate interventions are utmost important to reduce the risks of neurological dysfunction, kernicterus, or even death. From a national survey in neonates in China in 2009, 348 cases of kernicterus were reported among 33 hospitals. An important finding of the study is that these patients presented with symptoms around ages of 5\u20136 days, and were mostly at home [6]. The characteristics of onset age of kernicterus suggest that monitoring of bilirubin level at home is a useful way to alert hospital visit and to prevent the development of extreme hyperbilirubinemia.",
