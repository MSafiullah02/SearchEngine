Furthermore, cancer patients with COVID-19 infection have an increased risk of severe sequelae, including need for intensive care, ventilation, and death 2-4 . Gynecologic oncology patients frequently require complex invasive procedures and immunosuppressing therapies.

The Northeast region of the United States, New York in particular, is the most dramatically affected. This is consistent with New York's unenviable position of being an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our survey only showed a trend towards higher urban infection risk in the Northeast, other reports show that cites are more affected and our infection rate is likely an underestimate given that it is calculated per responder to avoid the risk of double counting patients 7 .

Cancer surgeries, with the possible exception of grade 1 endometrioid uterine cancer staging, are moving forward with minimal delays. However, ovarian cancer presents a particular challenge. Ovarian debulking surgery was rated as the most concerning treatment during the pandemic. This combined with the frequent need for chemotherapy are likely why ovarian cancer was rated as the most impacted gynecologic cancer by COVID-19. Interestingly, despite concerns regarding immunosuppression from maintenance therapy, most respondents have not changed their practice patterns in either the upfront or recurrent setting. A potential explanation for this is that maintenance therapies are generally well tolerated which could delay the need for appointment-intensive interventions such as imaging, laboratory testing and chemotherapy infusion.",

COVID-19 will be part of life for the near future and cancer care decisions must reflect this reality. It is imperative as a specialty that we have systems in place to identify these patients as well as prepare for the increased surgical need. Potential strategies to limit the risk of a second surge in the gynecologic cancer population would be routine COVID-19 testing prior to surgery or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f chemotherapy, maximizing same day discharges, and keeping cancer treatment areas separated from those with a COVID-19 diagnosis.",
