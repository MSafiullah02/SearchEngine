            "text": "SARS is a novel respiratory illness, characterized by acute onset of fever, malaise, cough, and shortness of breath, which emerged in the spring of 2003. Rapid global spread of SARS-corona virus in 2003 was facilitated by international travel as illustrated by initial dissemination of the SARS outbreak from Hong Kong [13]. Although concern of transmission to fellow passengers on aircraft was raised from early on, the first documented transmission of SARS-corona virus on airplane was reported in December of 2003 [10]. In their study, three flights that carried passengers with laboratory-confirmed SARS-corona virus infection were investigated. There was strong evidence to suggest transmission of SARS-corona virus to 22 fellow passengers and crew members in one flight from Hong Kong to Beijing, which carried a symptomatic passenger. Travelers who became infected were sitting in the same row as the index case or within three rows directly in front of him (suggesting spread by aerosol and small droplets). None of the passengers in other sections of the plane acquired infection pointing against the possibility of transmission by the aircraft ventilation system. There was no evidence of transmission on flights that carried SARS-corona virus\u2013infected passengers who were asymptomatic at the time of travel. These data suggest that the primary preventive strategy to minimize risk of in-flight transmission of SARS is to prevent symptomatic SARS patients from traveling [13].",

Although screening for tuberculosis is required for immigrants and refugees, it is not required for tourists, business travelers, and students coming to the United States [15]. Patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis may travel on commercial aircrafts without being aware of their diagnosis. The cough of a patient with tuberculosis releases droplet nuclei, which become airborne and are carried by air currents to neighboring passengers until they are cleared by the aircraft ventilation system. According to some estimates, 1 of every 26,000 airline passengers may be exposed to tuberculosis [12]. Risk is still low, however, to passengers and crew on commercial aircrafts in United States [11], [12], [16].",

Index patients on all seven flights were highly infectious (symptomatic, sputum smear positive for acid-fast bacilli, and evidence of cavitary disease on chest radiograph). There was strong evidence of tuberculosis transmission on three flights [11], [12], [16]. Infection was transmitted from one flight attendant to two other crew members on one flight [16], whereas transmission from the index case to fellow passengers and flight crew was documented in another two flights [11], [12]. Risk of transmission was associated with proximity to the index cases (sitting in same section of plane) and a long duration of flight (>12 hours). There was no evidence of transmission on the other four flights despite highly infectious passengers on board, suggesting that although in-flight transmission is possible, the risk is still very low.",

At this altitude, the partial pressure of inspired oxygen (Pio\n2) drops from 150 mm Hg (sea level) to 109 mm Hg [20]. This fall in Pio\n2 results in a drop of arterial oxygen saturation (Sao\n2). In one study of healthy flight-crew members during 22 scheduled flights, mean nadir Sao\n2 fell from 97% (preflight) to 88.6% at cruising altitude [21]. Most healthy travelers can compensate for this level of hypoxemia. Patients with pre-existing cardiac and respiratory conditions, however, who are hypoxemic at sea level, can develop respiratory distress with such a drop in Sao\n2 at high altitude. Up to 10% of radio calls to ground medical staff for in-flight medical emergencies is related to respiratory problems [22]. To ensure a safe and comfortable flight for these patients, they should be evaluated for need of in-flight oxygen therapy. Recommended tests for this evaluation are summarized in\nBox 1.Box 1Recommended tests to evaluate need for in-flight oxygen therapy\n1.Ability to walk 50 yards at a normal pace or climb one flight of stairs without becoming severely short of breath. Most practical test to evaluate fitness for commercial air travel.2.Pulse oximetry at rest and during exertion (adequate in most cases). Patients with Sao\n2\n > 95% in room air on sea-level do not require oxygen on board, whereas those with Sao\n2 < 92% require it. Individual in intermediate range requires some hypoxic exposure test to determine need for oxygen.3.Arterial blood gas: single most helpful blood test because Pao\n2 at sea-level is considered the best predictor of altitude Pao\n2 and tolerance. Pao\n2 < 70 in room air at sea level is an indication for in-flight oxygen therapy.4.Hypoxia altitude simulation test: sophisticated method. Pao\n2 is determined while patient breathes mixed gases simulating the aircraft cabin environment at 8000 ft altitude (85% nitrogen and 15% oxygen). If Pao\n2 is <50 mm Hg, medical oxygen should be considered.5.Exposure to hypoxia in an altitude chamber. Ideal preflight test. Also detects potential adverse effects of gas expansion. Only available in a few centers.6.Consider departing altitude, length of flight, destination altitude, and prior history of air travel when making decision for in-flight oxygen requirement.\n\nData from Refs.

Most of the victims do not have prior history of heart disease. Ventricular fibrillation is the most common rhythm recorded in victims of sudden cardiac arrest [38], [39]. Early defibrillation is the most important predictor of success and long-term survival [40]. Chances of survival decrease by 10% for each minute defibrillation is delayed. Previously, the common practice of airlines was to continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation and divert the plane to the nearest airport. This may take 20 minutes or longer, however, even in best of circumstances. This is an unacceptable delay in view of current standards of care for sudden cardiac arrest [41]. A more logical approach is to place automated external defibrillators on board and train flight crew in their use [42]. Onboard automated external defibrillators improve chances of survival in cardiac arrest and avoid unnecessary and futile diversions for idioventricular rhythm and asystole [6], [43], [44].",

In a case control study of 160 patients, history of recent travel was four times more common in patients with venous thromboembolism compared with controls [49]. Most cases of travel-related deep venous thrombosis are asymptomatic and result in no clinical consequences. Pulmonary embolism is the most dreaded complication of travel-related deep venous thrombosis presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, or even sudden death. In a study of 61 cases of sudden death in passengers arriving at Heathrow airport between 1979 and 1982, pulmonary embolism was identified as the cause of death on autopsy in 18% of cases [52].

Most travelers are at low risk and only need to follow nonpharmacologic measures listed in\nBox 2\n[1], [2], [33], [51], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76]. Patients with additional risk factors should seek medical advice before traveling. Physicians may recommend delaying travel plans after orthopedic surgery or trauma to lower extremities. The role of pharmacologic measures (aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin) is controversial and their use should be limited to individuals at highest risk (malignancy, personal history of venous thromboembolism, recent major orthopedic surgery) [22], [65]. Single dose of low-molecular-weight heparin 2 to 4 hours before long-haul flights (>10 hours) was associated with a significant reduction in risk of traveler's thrombosis in a randomized case-control study of 300 subjects [51], [67]. Although aspirin prophylaxis has been shown to be helpful in reducing incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in high-risk medical and surgical patients, its role in reducing travel-related deep venous thrombosis has not yet been evaluated in prospective studies [68], [69]. Travelers should be cautioned against indiscriminate use of aspirin because of potential side effects of allergic reactions and gastrointestinal bleeding [2], [65].Box 2Measures to minimize risk of traveler's thrombosis\nNonpharmacologic1.Bulkhead seating if available.2.Wear properly fitted graduated-compression stockings especially designed for air travel. Stockings are available over-the-counter and are reusable. Wear these correctly to avoid compression in popliteal area. Stockings are contraindicated in patients with peripheral arterial disease because these may provoke ischemia in this patient population.3.Avoid constrictive clothing.4.Take periodic walks during the flight.5.Simple, frequent, isometric calf exercises, such as flexion and extension of foot and ankle rotation exercises.6.Change positions periodically while seated.7.Avoid leg crossing.8.Maintain adequate hydration.9.Avoid excess alcohol and caffeine-containing drinks because they may cause dehydration.10.Do not place hand-luggage where it may restrict movement of legs and feet.11.Get off plane and walk around in air terminal at refueling stops.\n\nPharmacologic (may be considered for high-risk individuals)1.Aspirin: caution in patients with peptic ulcer disease or history of gastrointestinal bleeding.2.Low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\nData from Refs.

Thirty-four young infants (mean age 3 months), 13 of who were siblings of sudden infant death syndrome victims, were exposed overnight to environments of 15% oxygen. Oxygen saturations were variable (85%\u2013100%) but of lower mean (93%) in 15% oxygen as compared with 98% in room air. In low oxygen environments, irregular breathing (with respiratory pauses of less than 20 seconds) was more common.",

Second, hypoxic environments similar to those of commercial aircraft do stimulate infants to have lower oxygen saturations and irregular breathing. The studied infants did not drop to dangerously low oxygen levels or have true apnea, and neither the decreased oxygenation nor the respiratory irregularity were associated with any sign of clinical compromise.
