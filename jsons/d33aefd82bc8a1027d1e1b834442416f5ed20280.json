Figure 1 summarizes the key statistics of COVID-19 confirmed cases, suspected cases, and deaths between January 22, 2020 and February 21, 2020, using data from China's National Health Commission (NHC). [3] As illustrated, around 20% of the reported cases were critical and severe patients and around 95% of the mortalities occurred in Hubei province. In response to the pandemic's spread, China's central government launched a national effort aimed at implementing prevention and control mechanisms and cities started to implement quarantines.",

They utilized information technology to facilitate these changes. In this paper, we seek to answer two research questions: To address these two questions, we integrated two divergent streams of research, i.e., ITenabled healthcare services and pandemic response actions. Extant literature on IT-enabled healthcare services has primarily focused on adoption and usage of electronic health records (EHRs), [4] [5] [6] [7] clinical decision support systems, [8, 9] mobile healthcare app, [10, 11] web-based platform such as patient portals, [12, 13] and remote healthcare service such as remote patient monitoring. [14] These empirical studies have investigated multi-dimensional factors that may influence the adoption and usage of IT-enabled healthcare services. Another stream of research has focused on the prevention or/and control measures of outbreak of epidemic or pandemic diseases, including the implementation of real-time outbreak and disease surveillance systems, [15] [16] [17] development of algorithms for computerized epidemic early detection systems, [18, 19] and response strategies for the public health system. [20] The response strategies include (1) standardized terminologies for patients to effectively communicate their symptoms and medical histories, (2) threat detection using healthcare data spanning time and location, and (3) response actions such as designing and disseminating guidelines, directing reminders to physicians for worrisome cases, and educating physicians in the application of these guidelines.

For example, the Peking University People's Hospital (ranked #13) reprinted a series of articles related to COVID-19 prevention such as how to wear a mask, how to wash hands, and how to self-isolate at home in February 2020. In contrast, some hospitals invited their medical experts from different departments to write original articles about COVID-19 prevention and control measures (T1-PEAO). A good example comes from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei (ranked #8). It invited medical experts from infectious disease, respiratory medicine, neurology, and many other areas to write educational articles to the public. Another type of event is popular science article related to special needs people (T1-PESN), such as chronic disease patients, seniors, pregnant women, and children. Because of the quarantine and isolation policies, many patients with special needs were unable to see their doctors for follow-up visits. Therefore, some hospitals used their websites to provide medical guidelines for this group of patients to take care of themselves at home. For instance, Fuwai Hospital (ranked #23) published a series of articles for patients with heart diseases to deal with some symptoms during the quarantine period. Lastly, as people had to stay at home due to the quarantine and isolation policies, some began to exhibit symptoms of anxiety or stress. Hospitals thus rolled out professional advice on how to stay at home healthily and happily. For instance, on January 30, 2020, West China Hospital of Sichuan University (ranked #2) published an online book for reducing the level of anxiety and shared it freely with the public.",

Our findings indicate that 16 hospitals requested all their outpatients to use online methods (e.g. hospital's mobile app, hospital's service account on social media, and official website) to make appointment (T2-OA3). Three hospitals used robots or mobile devices to support their medical processes (T2-RPA). A good example is Guangdong Provincial People's hospital (ranked #27). On January 27, 2020, the hospital welcomed two new robotic employees to help deliver medicines from the pharmacy to the nurse workstation, as well as from the nurse workstation to the isolation ward. These robots are able to take the elevator, open and close doors, avoid obstacles, and recharge themselves. The utilization of these robots reduced close contact between healthcare workers, as well as between healthcare workers and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Later, on February 10, 2020, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital added three new robots to their medical service team. These three new robots were mainly responsible for guiding patients to appropriate departments and answering questions related to COVID-19 prevention.",

Online meeting tools were used for conferencing and social media apps such as WeChat were used for creating communication groups among healthcare workers and patients. A wide variety of digitized measures were also used for security control in the hospitals (T2-DSC). For instance, almost all the hospitals asked their visitors to report health status. Some hospitals used paper-based forms, but Ruijin Hospital (ranked #4) used QR code to capture this information. Patients could scan the QR code published on the website to fill in a form on WeChat. Then they could simply present the form to the security staff when they visited the hospital. Many hospitals also used infrared thermometers to detect visitor temperatures without touching the body. Furthermore, in order to save medical protective clothing and reduce the risk of human contact, only one doctor made the rounds of isolation wards and then used WeChat to communicate with other healthcare workers outside the wards. The final event in this theme is systems integration (T2-SI). Hospitals integrated their IT-infrastructure or information systems to better support diagnosis and clinical decision-making during the outbreak of COVID-19. One example comes from Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital (ranked #29). On January 31, 2020, the hospital integrated its laboratory information systems (LIS) to support its fever department. After the LIS integration, all the outpatients with fever symptoms could complete their doctor visits only in the fever department without visiting other departments in the hospital.",

Medical training is extremely important to reduce the infection risk to healthcare workers. Training topics such as how to wear protective clothing appropriately, how to take care of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, and how to provide professional counselling advices to anxious patients are thus critical. A pattern we observed in our data was that many hospitals recorded training videos and then shared them online internally and externally (T3-OT).

            "text": "plans pertaining to COVID-19 and other diseases online with peers (T3-OTG). For instance, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (ranked #1) and West China Hospital of Sichuan University (ranked #2) both shared their guidelines for COVID-19 treatment online.Online collaboration on treating COVID-19 critical and severe patients was another trend visible in our results. Online collaboration may take various forms. One form is within-hospital online collaboration (T3-OC1). For example, Ruijin Hospital (ranked #4) implemented an online collaboration platform for doctors to diagnose patients in a distributed mode. If the fever department had a patient that needed assistance from other departments, then doctors from other departments could stay in their own offices and join the consultation meeting via online collaboration tools. The main purpose was to reduce close contact and thus mitigate the risk of infection. Another form of online collaboration was cross-hospital collaboration at the same hospital in Wuhan (T3-OC2). Since there were many medical supporting teams working at the same hospital in Wuhan, they needed a common platform for knowledge sharing, discovery, and application.The majority of online collaboration events took the form of cross-hospital online collaboration in distributed mode (T3-OC3) which involved medical professionals from multiple hospitals located in different locations. This type of online collaboration consolidated medical expertise from different areas in various hospitals. For instance, on February 10, 2020, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University (ranked #22) collaborated with 11 hospitals to discuss and share treatment plans and experiences for COVID-19. This meeting was held on the distance healthcare platform constructed by the Henan provincial government. From Figure 4, we can observe that knowledge sharing (T3-OT, T3-OTG) among medical professionals was dominant in the early stages of the one-month study window. Nevertheless, the number of online collaboration events increased gradually (T3-OC1, T3-OC2, and T3-OC3) towards the later stage. This implies that medical professionals initially focused more on knowledge sharing and later more on knowledge application and discovery. Theme 4 -Telemedicine Events in this theme relate to providing online medical services or telemedicine. Five types of events were observed, including (1) online medical consultation services for COVID-19 symptoms (T4-OMC), (2) online medical consultation services for psychological problems (T4-OMP), (3) online medical consultation services for other diseases or follow-up consultation and prescription refill (T4-OMF), (4) Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled tools for the public to conduct self-assessment (T4-PSE), and (5) joint online doctor consultation services by multiple hospitals (T4-MHJ). In our sample, 22 hospitals, almost 50%, launched their online medical consultation services quickly to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic (T1-OMC), especially the hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei. For instance, Tongji Hospital in Wuhan (ranked #8) and Union Hospital in Wuhan (ranked #12) are both affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. They launched their online medical consultation services on January 24, 2020, the day after Wuhan was locked down. This action helped serve people who had fever symptoms. Later, many patients complained that they were unable to see their specialists for follow-up visits and refill their prescriptions. To meet these needs, 19 hospitals introduced new online follow-up medical consultation services and prescription refills (T4-OMF). Some hospitals even delivered medicine to the homes of patients, such as Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (ranked #18) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (ranked #48). Seven hospitals provided online consultation services for psychological problems (T4-OMP) to the public. One example comes from West China Hospital of Sichuan University (ranked #2). On February 14, 2020, West China Hospital launched an online consultation platform for psychological intervention. The platform integrated videos, hotline, audios, online mini-games, Q&A, and self-assessment to provide recommendations for affected people. Another event in this theme is online self-assessment tools (T4-PSE). Users could use these tools to self-evaluate their probability of having COVID-19. These tools were generally supported by AI technologies. The last type of event in this theme is joint doctor consultation services by multiple hospitals (T4-MHJ). Five hospitals reported doing so. Joint doctor consultation services were typically supported by companies or organizations such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. or China Central Television (CCTV) in order to attract more experts to participate in the medical consultation services.",
