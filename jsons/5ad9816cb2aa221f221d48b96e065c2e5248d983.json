After exclusion, 79 manuscripts were included in the review based on relevance and new data. A review of the coronavirus structure and function help to inform us on the pathophysiology of coronavirus infectivity. Coronaviruses are large, single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses approximately 32KB (11) . The viral RNA genome is housed inside a nucleocapsid, which itself is contained within a viral envelope (12) . This envelope comprises three distinct proteins: a \"membrane protein\" and \"envelope protein,\" which are both directly responsible for viral assembly, as well as a \"spike protein,\" which mediates viral entry into host cells (12) . When viewed with electron microscopy, these spike proteins are surface-exposed markers that produce a recognizable \"crown-like\" appearance to the virus. The spike proteins serve a critical step in initiating human infection, as well as determining host tissue specificity and inducing host immune response (13) (14) (15) . The coronavirus spike protein is composed of two unique subunits that facilitate viral-host binding (16) (17) (18) (19) . The S1 domain of the spike protein functions in viral binding and attachment to the host cell membrane. Numerous receptors on the human cell membrane that are involved in S1 subunit binding have been identified to date, including angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins (20, 21) . The S2 domain of the spike protein is responsible for fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, allowing the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome to enter the host cell. This process involves a complex interaction between viral and host machinery, which culminates in rapid viral replication within target cells. International research efforts are currently underway aimed at using the S1 domain of the spike protein as a target for therapeutic anti-viral therapy, as well as vaccine development.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 388, "end": 392, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 499, "end": 503, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 729, "end": 733, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1046, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1056, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1163, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1168, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1173, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1178, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1485, "text": "(20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1489, "text": "21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "The involvement of SARS-CoV-2 infection within human male and female reproductive systems has yet to be fully elucidated.

No studies have yet directly examined pregnant COVID-19 patients at earlier stages of pregnancy.The evidence from the two case-control studies (involving 46 patients and 287 controls) so far shows that COVID-19 during early pregnancy is not more severe than among non-pregnant women(53,63); similar patterns of symptomatology, disease severity and outcome were seen.Nonetheless, some infected pregnant patients do develop very serious disease requiring mechanical ventilation, and most very ill COVID-19 patients are delivered soon after the disease becomes severe, whether premature or full term. At least 5 pregnant patients have required mechanical ventilation, and 2 patients have died. Full term infants born when their mothers have active COVID-19 infections have done well overall.
