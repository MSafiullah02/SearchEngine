However, it is difficult to accurately determine etiology because of limitations concerning both clinical samples and laboratory analysis. It is difficult to obtain clinical samples for microbiological examination from the lower respiratory tract: percutaneous transthoracic fine needle lung aspiration is regarded as the gold standard sample and while relatively low-risk is little practiced (Scott and Hall, 1999); bronchoalveolar lavage is generally not done only in low-income country settings; and sputum samples obtained by nebulized saline induction can be contaminated during passage through the upper respiratory tract limiting their diagnostic value. Blood culture and chest radiograph are the traditional mainstays of diagnosis but blood culture is insensitive and chest radiography poorly specific. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that etiology can be complex and involve multiple pathogens.",

Etiology studies undertaken in the 1980s in low-income settings identified Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) as the common bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in children (Shann, 1995). These studies also identified a range of viral pathogens such as respiratory syncytial (RSV) and influenza viruses, but showed that the majority of pneumonia-related deaths were due to bacterial rather than viral pneumonia, with the exception of measles. In the past, pneumonia was a common cause of death in children with measles, either directly due to measles virus (giant cell pneumonia) or more commonly due to secondary bacterial pneumonia such as due to S. pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus.",

In addition to a very high risk of pneumonia due to common bacterial pathogens, they also develop pneumonia due to uncommon Gram negative bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter, to opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is also likely that these children are more susceptible to pneumonia from nosocomial infection in settings such as overcrowded nutritional rehabilitation units, but this has not been well quantified or described. HIV-infected infants with pneumonia often have more than one potential pathogen identified such as bacteria with viruses or M. tuberculosis, or PCP with CMV infection. While tuberculosis is generally thought to be associated with chronic respiratory symptoms, in infants it can present as an acute severe pneumonia with bacterial co-infection. This is likely to be common and responsible for the initial improvement frequently observed with standard antimicrobial therapy in childhood tuberculosis.",

Early antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected infants will reduce pneumonia risk even further. While bacterial conjugate vaccines are not as protective in HIV-infected infants as HIV-uninfected infants, they still do provide some protective efficacy, and this is important given the high burden of bacterial pneumonia in HIV-infected infants. Furthermore, it may be that vaccine efficacy may be improved further if the infant is receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of immunization, but there are no data to confirm this. Finally, infants that are exposed to tuberculosis in the household setting should be screened for tuberculosis, and if well should receive preventive therapy to reduce the risk of developing tuberculosis.",

Additionally, the rates of S. pneumoniae macrolide resistance have risen substantially in several parts of the world, contributing to an increased risk of macrolide treatment failure (Daneman et al., 2006).
