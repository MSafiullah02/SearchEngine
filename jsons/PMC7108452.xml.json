            "text": "Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003 around the world, many researchers have attempted to determine the natural reservoir of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies on the possible animal source of SARS-CoV have mainly focused on the Himalyan palm civet (Paguma larvata), though other animals (e.g. the raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides) have been shown to carry coronaviruses closely related to the SARS-CoV. Of note, these related animal coronaviruses possess a 29 base-pair sequence (position 27,869\u201327,897) in the putative open reading frame (ORF) 11 (Marra et al., 2003), that is absent in most human SARS-CoV isolates (Guan et al., 2003, Song et al., 2005). A more recent study on SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from palm civets and raccoon dogs from various live markets in China identified a series of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein gene (Kan et al., 2005). The authors suggested that these SNVs marked the transmission of SARS-CoV-like viruses from these animals into humans during various phases of the SARS epidemic. Most recently, SARS-like CoV have been found in bats though the S-gene homology with SARS-CoV is low, around 80%, and it is still uncertain as to whether this is the true natural reservoir for SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005a, Poon et al., 2005b).",

This study compared local SARS-CoV S1 gene sequences collected from 137 Hong Kong SARS patients from February to April 2003, with 27 other sequences then available from GenBank, using neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. The authors concluded that the international SARS epidemics were caused by closely related SARS-CoVs. However, some strains isolated from Hong Kong in the early phase of epidemic, were distinct from the international outbreak strain, and may have represented transitory strains of SARS-CoV (Chim et al., 2004). Furthermore, analysis of SARS-CoV strains subsequently isolated from China suggested that this virus may have been circulating there, unidentified, for some time before the international epidemic occurred (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, CSMEC, 2004, Zhao et al., 2004).",

A maximum likelihood (ML) tree were then constructed using the program PAUP* v4.0b10 (Swofford, 2001) under an optimum model of evolution as selected by the program Modeltest v3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998).

This correlates well with the early phase of the SARS epidemic, as has been defined previously (CSMEC, 2004, Song et al., 2005).

Therefore, it is reassuring that this more complex and demanding ML approach, using optimal models of evolution as described here, with these complete S-gene sequences, independently supports previous NJ analysis of the epidemiology of the 2003 SARS outbreaks (e.g. the Kimura two-parameter distance method used by the CSMEC, 2004, Fig. 6). Due to the availability of more data, Fig. 2 contains more sequences spread over a longer time-frame, and the clusters appear more clearly defined, than the similar figure presented by the CSMEC (2004, Fig. 6).",

Within the S-gene region they found mutations at positions (with respect to the TOR-2): C23412T, A23473G, C23518T, C23632T, C24864T, and A24978G. Tong et al.

In this study, we did not find any of these previously reported mutations, however, there were mutations found mainly in the TC samples (T21615A and T21901A) that have not been previously reported elsewhere.

Unfortunately, we do not know on what date the GUAN_LC2/LC3/LC4/LC5 samples were taken (they are unpublished sequences that were submitted to GenBank on 19 September 2003), and it is therefore difficult to ascertain whether this SNV represents ongoing host-adaptive evolution. All of these 56 CUHK samples came from patients admitted to Hong Kong's New Territories East hospital cluster during this period. The 17/56 patients carrying this C25114T mutation may have acquired their virus via a chain of contacts infected with this particular virus, or this mutation occurred in all of these viruses independently, perhaps in response to some common, unknown selection pressure. Therefore, without a more accurate epidemic history for this particular virus, it is hard to say whether this is a founder effect or natural selection acting upon the virus towards the end of the Hong Kong 2003 SARS outbreaks.",
