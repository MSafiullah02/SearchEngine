Mathematical models of infectious diseases have been developed in order to integrate realistic aspects of disease spreading [2\u20135]. A simple and commonly studied model, introduced by Kermack and McKendrick, is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [6]. In this model, populations can be in each of three states: susceptible, infected, and recovered (removed), denoted by S, I, and R, respectively. Originally, it is assumed that susceptible individuals become infected with a rate proportional to the fraction of infected individuals in the overall population (fully mixed approximation) and infected individuals recover at a constant rate. The epidemic process presents a (percolation) transition between a phase, in which the disease outbreak reaches a finite fraction of the population, and a phase with only a limited number of infected individuals [7,8]. The model has also been investigated for population on lattices (e.g., [9\u201311]) or on networks (e.g., [12\u201314]).",

Hence the state of system at each time does not depend on the previous history of the system: it is a memoryless, so-called Markovian, process. However, real surveys show evidence of a non-Markovian spreading process [25,26] in agreement with common expectation. The epidemic processes evolution and control, in human societies, cannot be considered without any memory effect. When a disease spreads within a human population, the experience or knowledge of individuals about that disease should affect their response [5]. If people know about the history of a certain disease in the area where they live, they use different precautions, such as vaccination, when possible. Thus, some endogenous controlled suppression of the spreading is expected, although other factors can help [27\u201329]. However, knowledge about the history of a disease does not have the same influence at all times. Experience about the prevalence of a disease and precautions related to the \u201cold times\u201d are not always applicable or recommended, hence people tend to follow new strategies against the diseases. In other words, memory of the earlier times could have less effect on the present situation, as compared to more recent times. It can be expected that long-range memory effects decay in time more slowly than an exponential decay, but can typically behave like a power-law damping function.",

Furthermore, in this work we focus on long-range memory effects, which means arbitrarily long history can be included. That is in contrast to short-term memory effects, which have been extensively studied. For instance, Dodds and Watts [37] introduced a general model of contagion considering memory of past exposures to a contagious influence. The authors have argued that their model can fall into one of three universal classes, due to the behavior of fixed point curves. Also, in [38\u201340], the authors consider \u201cimplicit memory\u201d by applying asynchronous adapting in disease propagation. They show that this type of memory can lead to a first-order phase transition in outbreaks, thus hysteresis can arise in such models [40].",

Typically, the evolution of epidemiological models is described with differential equations, the derivatives being of integer order. By replacing the ordinary time derivative by a fractional derivative, a time correlation function or memory kernel appears, thereby making the state of the system dependent on all past states. Thus, it seems that such a method based on derivatives with noninteger order, as introduced by Caputo for geophysics problems [51], is a very proper formalism for such non-Markovian problems. Moreover, Caputo's formalism provides the advantage that it is not necessary to define the fractional order initial conditions, when solving such differential equations [51\u201354]. Furthermore, the time correlation function, in the definition of Caputo fractional derivative, is a power-law function, which is flexible enough to reflect the fact that the contribution of more early states is noticeably less relevant than the contribution of more recent ones on the present state of the dynamical system.",

Also in [48] the authors use fractional order differential equations for epidemic models and concentrate on the equilibrium points of the models and their asymptotic stability of differential equations of fractional order. Other variations of the SIR model with fractional derivatives have also been studied. For instance, Seo et al. introduced the SIR epidemic model with square root interaction of the susceptible and infected individuals and discussed the local stability analysis of the model [56].

The choice of the coefficient 1/\u0393(\u03b1\u22121) and exponent (\u03b1\u22122) allows us to rewrite Eqs. (2) to the form of fractional differential equations with the Caputo-type derivative. If this kernel is substituted into Eqs. (2), the right-hand side of the equations, by definition, are fractional integrals of order (\u03b1\u22121) on the interval [t0,t], denoted by t0Dt\u2212(\u03b1\u22121). Applying a fractional Caputo derivative of order \u03b1\u22121 on both sides of each Eq. (2), and using the fact the Caputo fractional derivative and fractional integral are inverse operators, the following fractional differential equations can be obtained for the SIR model:\n(4)t0cDt\u03b1S(t)=\u2212\u03b2S(t)I(t),t0cDt\u03b1I(t)=\u03b2S(t)I(t)\u2212\u03b3I(t),t0cDt\u03b1R(t)=\u03b3I(t),where t0cDt\u03b1 denotes the Caputo derivative of order \u03b1, defined for an arbitrary function y(t) as follows [51]:\n(5)t0cDt\u03b1y(t)=1\u0393(\u03b1\u22121)\u222bt0ty\u2032(\u03c4)d\u03c4(t\u2212t0)\u03b1.Hence, the fractional derivatives, when introducing a convolution integral with a power-law memory kernel, are useful to describe memory effects in dynamical systems. The decaying rate of the memory kernel (a time-correlation function) depends on \u03b1. A lower value of \u03b1 corresponds to more slowly decaying time-correlation functions (long memory). Hence, in some sense, the strength (through the \u201clength\u201d) of the memory is controlled by \u03b1. As \u03b1\u21921, the influence of memory decreases: the system tends toward a memoryless system. Note that for simplicity, we assume the same memory contributions (same value of \u03b1) for different states of S, I, and R. Obviously, more complicated functions than Eq. (3) and taking into account different \u03b1i (i=1,2,3) could be investigated in further work to take into account different time scales.",

However, in the real world an individual connects to a small fraction of people. Hence, as is well known, more realistic modeling can be studied through networks, where their topology has a significant effect on the epidemic process [70\u201372]. For homogeneous networks, each individual has the same number of connections k\u2248\u2329k\u232a and disease propagates with spreading rate \u03b2\u2329k\u232a. In this case, it is obvious that the epidemic threshold (\u03b2\u03b3)c is simply replaced by (\u03b2\u03b3)c\u2329k\u232a. It is also true for the case of fractional differential equations (4). In other words, threshold point in Fig. 1 for each value of \u03b1 is shifted to (\u03b2\u03b3)c\u2329k\u232a.",

While for a memoryless SIR model (\u03b1=1), the system reaches a stationary state after a short time (t\u224320), the stationary time is increased with decreasing the value of \u03b1. Furthermore, we obtain the size of outbreaks at a finite time. Figure 7 shows 1\u2212St, measured with accuracy 10\u22125 until t=100 for different values of \u03b1. As we can see, the epidemic threshold is always zero, as it is for Markov epidemic spreading on scale-free networks with \u03bb=3. However, the size of epidemic decreases with decreasing \u03b1. The same results are obtained for networks with 2<\u03bb<3. However, for \u03bb>3, the epidemic threshold is shifted with including the memory, similar to what is observed for the homogeneous networks.\n\n",

Here we have reported a study on the evolution of the SIR epidemic model, considering memory effects. Using the fractional calculus technique, we show that the dynamics of such a system depends on the strength of memory effects, controlled by the order of fractional derivatives \u03b1. At finite times, including memory effects, the epidemic threshold (\u03b2/\u03b3)c is shifted to higher values than those for memoryless systems, at values depending on the memory decay rate \u03b1. In the case that the model evolves on heterogeneous scale-free networks with 2<\u03bb\u22643, the threshold point is always zero. However, the fraction of individuals who are infected or recovered, is reduced if the memory \u201clength\u201d increases. Hence, memory renders the system more robust against the disease spreading. If the epidemic process evolves further in time, for a fixed memory strength, (i) the disease can infect more individuals and (ii) the epidemic threshold is shifted to smaller values and tends to the memoryless case values.",

More advanced epidemic models, based on various types of complex networks, are surely interesting subjects for further investigations, in line with investigations such as, e.g., in [30\u201334].
