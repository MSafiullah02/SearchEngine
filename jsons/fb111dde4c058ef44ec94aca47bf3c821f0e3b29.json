Putative mechanisms are acute coronary syndrome, demand ischemia, microvascular ischemic injury, cytokine dysregulation or myocarditis (2) . However, myocardial injury does not always correlate exclusively with COVID-19 and it may also reveal incidental cardiomyopathy. Thus, physician have to stay alert and a careful etiological assessment is required in these patients. As contagious risk and patient instability may preclude initial work up, reassessing the patient after the acute phase is of utmost importance.",

Hs-Troponin I and Nt-proBNP were elevated (100ng/L and 9300pg/ml) suggesting myocardial involvement. Bedside echocardiography revealed an enlarged left ventricle with impaired left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%. Patient improved on high dose diuretics and non-invasive ventilation. He was discharged 9 days later, on Bisoprolol, Furosemide and Spironolactone. One month later, LVEF improved at 40% with normal filling pressure and cardiac output. Echocardiography revealed a two layered structure of the myocardium suggesting IVNC(3). CMR confirmed the IVNC diagnosis but also revealed an acute myocarditis (figure1). Coronary-CT angiography ruledout coronary artery disease. IVNC patients have variable prognosis, ranging from prolonged asymptomatic course to severe cardiac disability. Prognosis is worse in patients hospitalized for heart failure, NYHA classes III-IV, lower LVEF and elevated LV filling pressures(4).",
