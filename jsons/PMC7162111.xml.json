The nose is the gateway to the respiratory tract and rhinitis is associated with symptoms arising from the sinuses [5], middle ear [6], the nasopharynx and lower airways [7]. Occupational rhinitis often precedes the development of occupational asthma. Both allergic rhinitis (AR) and non\u2010AR are risk factors for the development of asthma [7]. Rhinosinusitis can also be the presenting complaint of potentially severe systemic disorders such as Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis and Churg\u2013Strauss syndrome [8]. Therefore, all patients presenting with nasal symptoms require appropriate treatment based on an accurate diagnosis. Separate British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) guidelines on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis will also be published.",

Further searches were carried out by combining these search terms with allergy, asthma, immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), corticosteroid, antihistamine, anti\u2010leukotriene, ipratropium bromide, decongestant, cromoglicate, cat, house dust mite (HDM), anti\u2010IgE, child, pregnancy, lactation, surgery and aspirin. Each article was reviewed for suitability for inclusion in the guideline. The recommendations were evidence graded at the time of preparation of these guidelines. The grades of recommendation and the levels of evidence are defined as in our previous guideline on urticaria [9]. During the development of these guidelines, a web\u2010based system was used to allow consultation with all BSACI members. The draft guidelines were amended by the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) after careful consideration of all comments and suggestions. Where evidence was lacking, a consensus was reached among the experts on the committee. Conflicts of interests were recorded by the SOCC; none jeopardized unbiased guideline development.",

A number of allergens affect both the nose and the lungs [163] and allergy to HDM or cat dander is a risk factor for both asthma and rhinitis [170, 171]. Many patients with AR have increased non\u2010specific bronchial reactivity [172, 173] during seasonal [174] and perennial [175] allergen exposure. Asthma [169] and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are more common and severe in perennial compared with seasonal rhinitis [175, 176]. Patients with SAR develop seasonal increases in non\u2010specific bronchial responsiveness (BR) but not necessarily asthma symptoms, and these patients often have normal BR during the winter months [177]. BR is also increased in viral rhinitis [178, 179] and following nasal allergen challenge [180, 181]. These observations suggest that bronchial inflammation is associated with nasal inflammation, and is supported by the fact that bronchial hyper\u2010reactivity is reversed by intranasal treatment with sodium cromoglycate [182] and corticosteroids [38, 183]. Nasal allergen challenge results in eosinophil ingress not only to the nose but also to the bronchi, and vice versa [184]. Segmental bronchoprovocation with allergen in AR patients leads to significant changes in mast cell and basophil numbers in both the nasal and bronchial mucosa [185]. A systemic link has been postulated with inhaled allergen, causing a release of immature eosinophils from the bone marrow into the circulation, from where they migrate to the whole respiratory tract, not just to the site of allergen contact [186].",

The best position for administration of nose drops is with the child lying, head back; see Fig. 4b [42]. A short course of oral steroids may be required to relieve nasal congestion with systemic symptoms in SAR. Surgical referral for submucosal resection of the inferior turbinate bones may be indicated only if extensive medical treatment fails [153].\u2022For refractory rhinorrhoea, ipratropium bromide 0.03% may be helpful [120, 198].\u2022For SAR, saline nasal irrigation during the pollen season may improve symptoms and reduce antihistamine requirement [55].\u2022Leukotriene receptor antagonists may have a role if there is concomitant asthma [103].\u2022To treat underlying allergic disease, allergen immunotherapy is widely used in Europe but has yet to gain general acceptance in the United Kingdom [136, 137]. Efficacy has been demonstrated with both subcutaneous [137, 199] and SLIT [200, 201, 202, 203] but is contra\u2010indicated in children with asthma.\n",
