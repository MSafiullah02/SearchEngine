This chapter examines how these activities expose them to increased risks of infection and disease. Along with many other factors that predispose to clinical infection, recreational behavior may either expose the host to infective organisms or modify the immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infection and disease. Recreational infection can be classified by recreational activity or according to the particular infections (or systems infected, see Table 71-1\n). Inevitably there is considerable overlap with other sections of this book, such as international medicine (see Section 6) and zoonotic infection.",

In 2012, 5780 cases of presumed or confirmed arboviral disease were reported in the USA, of which the majority was West Nile virus with 5674 cases.18 West Nile virus, spread by mosquitoes, is now seen throughout the USA and Southern Europe and outdoor activities such as camping and hiking put people at increased risk of bites by these arthropod vectors. Yellow fever is a life-threatening mosquito-borne, zoonotic viral infection and the illness remains a risk for travelers and residents during outdoor activities in endemic regions of Africa and South America. In certain parts of Europe, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is regularly reported and a major risk factor is outdoor recreation (in particular, walking through long grass while wearing short trousers). The increased incidence TBE in recent years is thought to be due in part to increased time spent outdoors due to the warm weather.19 An inactivated vaccine is available.",

Microbiologic standards now exist for bathing water in Europe and North America. There is certainly a risk of infection from swimming in heavily contaminated water but the risk of minor symptomatic infection from swimming in less heavily polluted water remains contentious.27 A cohort study of swimmers in public beaches in Spain found incidence rates of gastrointestinal, cutaneous and high respiratory tract symptoms were higher in bathers, but the differences were not statistically significant. Symptoms were related to the number of total coliforms and fecal coliforms in the water.28\n",

It is estimated that on average in the UK there are 5 million recreational water users each year exclusive of bathers, and yet amongst this at-risk population there are only 2.5 cases of leptospirosis a year.29 The annual total incidence of leptospirosis in England and Wales is more than 10 times that figure; it occurs principally among agricultural workers. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection that is mainly carried by rodents; it is estimated that about 25% of the rats in UK are infected. The risk of contracting infection relates less to the overall water quality than to the density of the local rodent population. Triathlon and other forms of \u2018adventure racing\u2019 have led to outbreaks of leptospirosis.30 Sejvar et al. described the outbreak that occurred during the 2000 \u2018Eco-Challenge\u2019 event in Sabah, Borneo.31 Of 304 competing athletes, 42% met the case definition for leptospirosis. The authors suggest that taking 200 mg of doxycycline weekly during exposure may limit infection and disease (a strategy previously demonstrated to be effective by the US military).",

It was established that 95% of orienteers received scratches or wounds during the competition.

Suggestions of increased sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at these recreational events is difficult to prove and has not been backed by evidence.
