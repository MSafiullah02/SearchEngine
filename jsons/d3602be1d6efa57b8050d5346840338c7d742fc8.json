Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results on short-term strategies point to either a two-step control strategy, following failed mitigation, that begins with suppression of the reproduction number, \u211bC, below 1.0, followed by renewed mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining \u211bC at approximately 1.0, or should suppression not be feasible, the progressive lowering of the effective reproductive number, \u211bCeff \u2248 \u211bC S/N, below 1.0. The objectives of the full sequence of measures observed in a number of countries, and likely to see in the longer term, can be symbolically represented as: \u211b0 \u00e0 \u211bC<\u211b0 \u00e0 \u211bC<<1.0 \u00e0 \u211bC\u22481.0 \u00e0 \u211bCeff<1.0. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it fits into longer-term sequences of measures, including using the herd immunity concept to 'leverage' acquired immunity.",

First, the accuracy of the simulator output is untested with respect to analytical results, independent computational studies, and other SEIR platforms. The only test conducted here did verifiy that the simulated equilibrium fraction of susceptible individuals (S\u00a5) followed the predicted relation: -ln(S\u00a5/S0)= \u211b(1-S\u00a5/S0) (15) . The results presented below -even if consistent with intuition -nevertheless need to be viewed as preliminary and contingent on future testing. Second, precision in the intervals for input parameters and platform output were not always to the last decimal places, and for large numbers, such as the total community size N, a limited number of choices were available. Therefore, for example, there was no choice for exactly N=70 million, and as such the next highest option (70,420,854) was employed. The same was true for simulations with the lower population size of N=70K (70,263 was used). Moreover, the data presented below (i.e., y-axis data point readings) were in some cases closest interpolations of closely neighboring values that resulted in the simulation target. Varying the input and reading rules to neighboring values was found to have negligible effects on the trends reported, and did not change the main conclusions of this study.",

We chose 60 days because it is the approximate period that areas of China (as the first affected country), decided to enter lockdown. Table   2 support these insights, whereby suppression measures need to be increasingly strict in order to reduce the time necessary to obtain low target case numbers. regulating the infectious numbers to less than 10% of the total population requires \u211bC less than c.1. 5 , which is about a 40% reduction in the \u211b0 assumed here ( Fig. 2A) . Peak levels of hospitalization can reach c.7%-10% should mitigation measures be 20% or less effective at reducing \u211b0 (Fig. 2B) . Such levels would exceed hospital bed capacity in most countries by at least an order of magnitude (18). Reducing peak hospitalization levels well below 1% (which is still too high for many health services) would require \u211bC close to 1.0. Finally, similar to the trends in Figs. 2A,B , fatalities are sensitive to the effectiveness of prior suppression measures and community size, indicating that \u211bC needs to be reduced towards unity for smaller communities and those unable to reduce infectious cases sufficiently during suppression measures (Fig. 2C) .",

Although not explored here, numerical simulations for parameter values associated with points above the dashed line in (A) were influenced by 'herd immunity', i.e., when the proportion of the population in the susceptible class, S/N<(1.0-1.0/\u211b) (19) . Moreover, note that the result in (A) appears to contrast with the results in Steir et al. (5) , who showed higher case growth rates with city size. The discrepancy can be explained by the different units employed in each study (case growth rate in (5) vs. fraction of total population infected at some point during a fixed time interval (this study)) and how \u211b was estimated in (5) The herd immunity threshold is contingent on \u211b0. But policies that reduce transmissions resulting in \u211b < \u211b0 will also reduce the threshold. We observed that the attainment of herd immunity, whereby the rate of new infections is reduced below unity (when St/N<1.0-1.0/\u211b), did not ensure the rapid end to an outbreak ( Fig. 2A) . Indeed, 'epidemic overshoot' (20) occurs in this simple model for all \u211b>1.0. Figure 3 extends the findings in Fig. 2A (limited to 200 days) Finally, whereas mitigation measures result in fewer cases (Figs. 2, 3) , if \u211bC>1.0, then they also lengthen the course of the epidemic (Figure 4 ). An epidemic with no mitigation (example shown here is \u211b0 =3.0) is 95% complete 85 days after the 100 th case. In contrast, an outbreak coming % Infected ",

Mathematical models based on empirical data have a role to play in adapting capacities to address epidemics, both as conceptual aids and management tools. The present study explored two generic types of intervention that can contribute to reducing the impact of COVID-19 epidemics. 'Suppression measures' would be adopted by communities that either initially decided not (or did, but were unable) to mitigate the exponential increase of new cases. Suppression reduces the reproduction number below 1.0, and in so doing lowers the number of infectious cases to a manageable level. 'Mitigation measures' may either be introduced as a preventive approach, whereby communities begin to manage very early in an outbreak, gradually introduced towards the end of a suppression strategy, or for countries unable or unwilling to enforce suppression measures, the only route possible to flatten ",

We find that although herd immunity is predicted to occur when 60 to 70% of the population have been infected and become immune (based on parameters in Table 1) , if an outbreak is left unchecked, then the virus will eventually infect approximately 90% of the population ('epidemic overshoot'). According to our model, some level of overshoot always occurs for mitigation measures, but the degree depends on the intensity of such members. For example, measures that lower \u211b0 by 50% from 3.0 to 1.5 will still result in approximately 60% of the population eventually becoming infected, even though the herd immunity threshold is about 33%. (Figure 4) . Mitigation, even if less restrictive compared to suppression, has impacts on health services, society and the economy. Maintaining \u211bC\u22651.0 is therefore a short-term solution to contain an epidemic whilst preserving certain liberties.

According to our simulations, a population the approximate size of Western European nations such as France, Spain, the UK and Germany would need to reduce transmission probabilities to near zero to attain the objective, should infectious numbers be on the order of 100,000. Early interventions in populations with 1 to 100 circulating infectious individuals would still require considerable measures, with reductions in baseline \u211b0=2.5 of 25% to 60%, respectively. Given cumulative case number doubling times observed in some countries of about 3 to 5 days (17) (and therefore c. 2 weeks between each log integer on the x-axis of Figure 1), the choice of measures without knowing their true impacts on the reproduction number could have resulted in insufficient flattening of the epidemic curve and valuable time lost.

(Additional numerical experiments not presented here indicate that the observed trends apply at least in the total population range of 10 4 to 10 8 ). The second variable explored was the effectiveness of previous suppression measures; we evaluated high effectiveness (a reset to a single infectious case) and a less, but still acceptable reset to 100 infectious cases. Clearly, any subsequent mitigation measures yielding \u211bC<1.0 would result in infectious cases decreasing over time (and therefore be a successful outcome), but given the impacts of such measures on society, below we consider strategies that seek to contain a second epidemic by tuning \u211bC to between 1.0 and \u211b0.",
