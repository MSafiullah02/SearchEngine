The susceptibility of different cell lines to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 offers valuable information for future work on antiviral compounds, vaccine strain production, investigation of cellular interactors, and host responses to infection. Moreover, the results obtained in the permissive animal cells might be an indicator of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 cross-species recognition.",

VeroE6 is the standard cell line used to produce viral stocks of SARS-CoV-2 in different laboratories and to do plaque assays. 2 The noted cytopathic effects are consistent with use of this cell line in virology because of the susceptibility of VeroE6 cells to infection, lower saturation density (optimal for plaque formation), and interferon \u03b1 and interferon \u03b2 secretion deficiency. 2 The FRhK4 cell line has been studied less than has VeroE6 and, hence, further investigations to enlighten the cytopathic effects in the context of an intact innate immune response will be relevant.",

These results do not fully recapitulate the animal tropism reported so far: findings of studies of SARS-CoV-2 3 and SARS-CoV have highlighted possible infections in cats (and felines in general), ferrets, and hamsters, whereas rabbits were not investigated, dogs seemed (until now) to be poorly permissive, and pigs were not infectable. These discrepancies might derive from the kidney origin of the cells, their immortalisation, or the culturing conditions. Different bat cell lines were also assessed by Chu and colleagues, including in Rhinolophus sinicus kidney (RSK) and lung (RSL) cells. 1 Only SARS-CoV showed significant growth in RSK cell lines, although at reduced extent compared with other animal cell lines, and no replication was evident in RSL cell lines. Further studies will need to investigate the susceptibility of cell lines from Rhinolophus affinis, the bat species in which the sequence of the bat coronavirus RaTG13 (the virus phylogenetically closest to SARS-CoV-2) was identified. 4 Moreover, in bats, coronaviruses are often detected in anal swabs; therefore, animal gastrointestinal epithelial cell lines should be assessed in future studies.",

            "text": "Chu and colleague also compared various human cell lines, including pulmonary (Calu3), intestinal (Caco2), hepatic (Huh7), and neuronal (U251) cells. However, some anatomical sites or cell types (eg, cardiomyocytes) were not represented or only one cell line was used to represent a site; for example, with use of only U251 cells, the presented findings are not sufficient to draw conclusions on neuroinvasiveness, particularly since they contrast with previous research. 4 SARS-CoV-2 replication was greatest in Calu3 and Caco2 cell lines, and these anatomical sites (pulmonary and intestinal) are the ones positive for viral RNA in humans. 5 Notably, SARS-CoV-2 grew in Calu3 cells, but not in A549 cells, although both cell lines derive from lung adenocarcinoma. This finding accords with previous results in A549 cells, which were infectable only on overexpression of ACE2, 6 whereas use of Calu3 cells has been reported elsewhere. 7 SARS-CoV-2 was shown to grow faster and at a higher titre than SARS-CoV in Calu3 cells, in agreement with findings of earlier work by Chu and colleagues, 8 in which the susceptibility of ex-vivo human lung tissues to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was assessed. SARS-CoV-2, despite the higher titre, does not induce interferon secretion and causes lower upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines than does SARS-CoV. 8 These results suggest a better immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2, but a more mechanistic investigation is needed to draw conclusions.",
