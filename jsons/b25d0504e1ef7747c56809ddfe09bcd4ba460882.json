Therefore, it is crucial to determine the drug treatment plan as soon as possible to deal with the outbreak of COVID-19. 8 Corticosteroids have a good inhibitory effect on inflammatory factors and are often used as an auxiliary treatment for viral pneumonia. The main anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids is to inhibit a large number of pro-inflammatory genes that encode cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes, and receptors to address the inflammatory process and restore homeostasis. 9 However, the results of clinical studies on the role of corticosteroids remain controversial. A retrospective study showed that the vast majority of SARS patients received satisfactory results from the use of corticosteroids. 10 But in a retrospective observational study of MERS patients, the result showed that patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require",

            "text": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the result indicated that patients with severe conditions were more likely to require corticosteroids therapy. The similar results were also observed in the subgroup of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and patients with SARS-CoV infection. A study showed that the concentrations of cytokines (such as interleukin 7 [IL7], IL8, IL9, IL10 and so on) in serum in the COVID-19 patients were higher than in healthy adults. In addition, cytokines (such as IL2, IL7, IL10 and so on) concentrations in intensive care unit (ICU) patients were higher than non-ICU patients. These revealed that patients with COVID-19 were usually accompanied by increased immune factors and inflammatory responses, and the concentrations of immune factors were associated with the severity of the disease. 5 Further autopsy revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with fibrous mucinous exudate and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration dominated by lymphocytes, which were very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. 27 As we all known, corticosteroids do not directly inhibit virus replication, their main role is anti-inflammatory and suppress immune response. 28 In the early stage of inflammation, glucocorticoids reduce capillary dilation, inflammatory cell exudation, leukocyte infiltration, and phagocytosis. In the late stage, glucocorticoids can inhibit the excessive proliferation of capillaries and fibroblasts. Furthermore, by binding to their receptors, glucocorticoids inhibit nuclear transcription factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling and further inhibit the transcription and translation of inflammatory factors. 9 These explained why corticosteroids therapy was more needed in severely ill patients with coronavirus infection. Our analysis demonstrated that patients treated with corticosteroids had a higher mortality rate, and longer LOS. There might be multiple mechanisms that contributed to these outcomes. There is a study shows that glucocorticoids inhibit the production of IL-2 and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3 ) in T lymphocytes, shift T cell responses from the Th1 to the Th2 type, induce programmed cell death in a variety of different immunologically relevant cells, including immature T and B cell precursors and mature T cells. 29 Another study find that preexisting CD4 + T cells are associated with lower viral shedding and less severe disease. 30 There is evidence that the use of corticosteroids may lead to prolonged removal of viral RNA from the airways, 11 blood, 31 and feces of patients, 32 resulting in longer hospital stays, and ultimately increasing the risk of mortality. In addition, our analysis found that patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were more likely to develop bacterial infection due to immunosuppression. This could make the disease worse and lead to death. We also performed subgroup analysis, the result indicated that the mortality of neither SARS-CoV nor MERS-CoV was associated with corticosteroids therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with mortality when we excluded a study. 14 Therefore, we need to treat this result with caution.",

In a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with SARS, a total of 29 studies on corticosteroids were included, of which 25 were inconclusive, and only 4 provided conclusive data on the harms of corticosteroids. 33 In a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with influenza pneumonia, the results showed that compared with placebo, corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality, longer ICU LOS, and a higher rate of secondary infection but not mechanical ventilation days. 34 In addition, a meta-analysis included ten studies with 1137 recovered SARS patients showed that patients who received higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids were more likely to develop osteonecrosis. 35 These meta-analyses indicated that patients with coronavirus pneumonia could not benefit from corticosteroid treatment. However, there are some limitations in this meta-analysis. First, most of the included studies are retrospective cohort studies, historical control studies, etc., with a low level of evidence and a lack of randomized controlled trials with optimized design. Second, there is no uniform standard for the time and dosage of hormones used in various studies. Third, the effects of corticosteroids may be influenced by other therapeutic options, such as antiviral drugs. Finally, due to the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 situation, some studies have not been published, while other developments are not intended to be reported for reasons of confidentiality, which will lead to publication bias.",
