In 1996, following the sequence analysis of their genomes, EAV, LDV, SHFV, and PRRSV were classified as species within a new family, Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus. EAV was designated the prototype of this family. At the same time, the family Arteriviridae was classified together with the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. This order also includes two additional virus groups, the toroviruses (a genus in the Coronaviridae family) and the family Roniviridae. The arterivirus genome shares similar general organizational features and conserved replicase motifs with corona-, toro-, and ronivirus genomes, but is only about half their size. In addition, arterivirus particles are smaller than those of other nidoviruses, differ from them morphologically, and are the only ones to have an isometric nucleocapsid structure.",

ORF 1b is translated only when a \u20131 ribosomal frameshift occurs in the short ORF 1a/ORF 1b overlap region. A \u2018slippery sequence\u2019 upstream of a pseudoknot directs frameshifting and for EAV, a frameshifting efficiency of 15\u201320% has been reported. ORF 1a encodes three or four proteases that post-translationally cleave the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins at multiple sites into the mature viral nonstructural proteins (Figure 2\n). The lengths of the ORF 1a regions of the different arteriviruses vary. ORF 1b encodes major conserved domains, in particular an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a putative zinc-binding domain, an RNA helicase, and a nidovirus uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. The multiple 3\u2032-proximal ORFs (Figure 2) encode the structural proteins. There are six such ORFs in the genomes of EAV, PRRSV, and LDV, while SHFV contains nine ORFs downstream of ORF 1b. Limited sequence homology suggests that the SHFV ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3 may be duplications of ORFs 4, 5, and 6, respectively. In most cases, adjacent structural protein genes of arteriviruses are in different reading frames and overlap. Conserved transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs; Figure 3\n) are located at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic leader sequence (leader TRS) and upstream of each of the 3\u2032-proximal ORFs (body TRSs).

The proteins generated from these ORFs contain all functions required for viral RNA synthesis. Both pp1a/pp1ab contain multiple papain-like cysteine proteases and a chymotrypsin-like (or \u20183C-like\u2019) serine protease (Figure 2). The EAV papain-like cysteine proteases each cleave at a single site. The nsp4 serine protease, or main protease, cleaves at six sites in the pp1a region and at three additional sites in the ORF 1b-encoded part of pp1ab. Due to the existence of two alternative processing cascades (minor and major pathways) a variety of processing intermediates and mature proteins are generated from the C-terminal half of pp1a. In total, 13 (EAV) or 14 (PRRSV/LDV) mature proteins are (predicted to be) generated from the arterivirus replicase polyproteins. Three hydrophobic regions in pp1a are thought to be important for membrane association of the viral replication\u2013transcription complexes. With the exception of nsp1, which is partly found in the nucleus, the rest of the nonstructural proteins localize to endoplasmic reticulum-derived double-membrane structures (Figure 1(d)) in the perinuclear region (Figure 1(e)).

An exception is mRNA 2, which is bicistronic encoding GP2b and E. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is encoded by ORF 7 (ORF 9 in SHFV). Analysis of the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the PRRSV N protein suggests that arteriviruses have a unique capsid-forming domain.

Evidence for a specific saturable, but as yet unidentified receptor for LDV on a subpopulation of murine macrophages has been reported. LDV-immune complexes are also infectious and can infect macrophages via Fc receptors. Sialoadhesin (sialic acid-dependent lectin-like receptor 1), a macrophage-restricted, cell surface protein, has been shown to mediate the internalization of PRRSV by alveolar macrophages. Heparin sulphate on the cell surface and sialic acid on the virion are also thought to play a role in entry. PRRSV has been reported to enter cells via a low pH-dependent endocytic pathway. Soon after infection, both EAV and LDV particles have been observed in small vesicles that appear to be clathrin-coated. The existence of an additional level of host restriction at the endosomal membrane fusion or uncoating steps was suggested by the observation that nonsusceptible cells expressing recombinant sialoadhesin could internalize virus but rarely became productively infected.",

Either a full-length minus-strand RNA, that then serves as a template for genomic RNA synthesis, or subgenomic minus strands, that then serve as the templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis, can be produced. The subgenomic RNAs are thought to be produced by a mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis that utilizes conserved primary (TRSs) and higher-order RNA structures as signals for producing a subgenomic minus-strand template for each subgenomic mRNA. Subgenomic mRNAs are 3\u2032-coterminal and contain a common 5\u2032 leader sequence that is identical to the 5\u2032 terminus of the genomic RNA. cis-Acting regulatory signals required for arterivirus replication have been mapped to the \u223c300 nt at each end of the genome.

However, transmission of LDV from mother to the fetus via the placenta and to pups via breast milk/saliva has been documented within the first week after infection of the mother. Since LDV in mice and SHFV in patas monkeys is produced throughout the lifetime of persistently infected animals, the transfer of fluids or tissues from an infected animal to an uninfected one results in the inadvertent transfer of infection. Historically the most frequent mode of transmission of LDV among laboratory mice and SHFV from patas monkeys to macaques has been through experimental procedures such as the use of the same needle for sequential inoculation of several animals. Currently, the most frequent sources of LDV contamination are pools of other infectious agents or tumor cell lines that have been repeatedly passaged in mice, especially those first isolated in the 1950s. Such materials should be checked for the presence of LDV. Infectious agent stocks can be \u2018cured\u2019 of LDV by passage in a continuous cell line or a different animal species.

In fatally infected horses, lesions are found in subcutaneous tissues, lymph nodes, and viscera. The progression of PRRSV infection in pigs is likely to be similar to that observed with EAV.

The most common symptoms of natural EAV infections in horses are anorexia, depression, fever, conjunctivitis, edema of the limbs and genitals, rhinitis, enteritis, colitis, and necrosis of small arteries.

Although there are five naturally occurring LDH isozymes in mouse plasma, only the level of isozyme LDVV is elevated in LDV-infected mice. Studies have indicated that the increase in enzyme levels is primarily the result of a decreased rate of enzyme clearance. A subpopulation of Kupffer cells involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDH is severely diminished in mice by 24 h after LDV infection. It has been postulated that LDV replication in these cells causes their death and results in increased LDH serum levels. Splenomegaly, characterized by a greater than 30% increase in spleen weight, occurs in about 40% of the mice infected with LDV. The increase in spleen weight is observed by 24 h after infection and persists for up to a month.

Despite the lifelong presence of circulating viral immune complexes and the demonstration of some LDV antibody deposits in the kidneys of LDV-infected mice as early as 7 days after infection, these animals do not develop kidney disease.

Low levels of C1q-binding activity can only be detected between days 10 and 18 after LDV infection.

(c) An electron micrograph of EAV particles budding from smooth membranes in (or close to) the Golgi region of infected baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) cells. (d) An electron micrograph of typical double-membrane vesicles found in the cytoplasm of arterivirus-infected cells that have been implicated in replication complex formation and viral RNA synthesis. (e) Localization of selected EAV nonstructural and structural proteins in infected BHK-21 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. In contrast to all other nsps (e.g., nsp3), the N-terminal replicase subunit nsp1 only partially localizes to the perinuclear region and is partially targeted to the nucleus. The double-labeling for nsp3 and the N protein shows that a considerable part of the latter co-localizes with the viral replication complex, whereas another fraction of the N protein is targeted to the nucleus. Early in infection, double-labeling for the major glycoprotein GP5 and the M protein showed almost complete co-localization of the two proteins in the Golgi complex, in the form of the heterodimer that has been found to be critical for virus assembly. Later in infection, the M protein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. Scale = 50 nm (a, c\u2013d). (a) Reprinted from Snijder EJ and Meulenberg JM (1998) The molecular biology of arteriviruses.

            "text": "Figure 2: Arterivirus genome organization and expression are illustrated using the family prototype EAV as an example. The genomic open reading frames are indicated and the names of the corresponding proteins are given. Below the genome, the nested set of mRNAs found in infected cells is depicted, with RNA1 being identical to the viral genome and subgenomic RNAs 2\u20137 being used to express the structural protein genes located in the 3\u2032-proximal quarter of the genome. With the exception of the bicistronic mRNA2, the subgenomic mRNAs are functionally monocistronic. The EAV replicase gene organization is depicted in the polyprotein pp1ab from the replicase (pp1a is identical to the nsp1\u20138 region of pp1ab). Ribosomal frameshift (RFS) delineates the boundary between amino acids encoded in ORF 1a and ORF 1b and arrows represent sites in pp1ab that are cleaved by papain-like proteases (yellow and blue) or the main (3CL) protease (red). The proteolytic cleavage products (nsps) are numbered and the locations of various conserved domains are highlighted. These include domains with conserved Cys and His residues (C/H), putative transmembrane domains (TM), protease domains (PL1, PL2, and 3CL), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRp), helicase (HEL), and uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (N).

            "text": "Figure 3: Arterivirus RNA synthesis (using a hypothetical virus that produces four subgenomic (sg) mRNAs). Both replication (top panel) and transcription (bottom panel) are depicted. In the \u2018replication mode\u2019, the RdRp produced a full-length minus-strand RNA (antigenome) that serves as the template for synthesis of new genomic RNA. In the \u2018transcription mode\u2019, minus-strand RNA synthesis is thought to be discontinuous and regulated by transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). Body TRSs (B) in the genome would act as attenuators of minus-strand RNA synthesis. Subsequently, the nascent minus strand, with an anti-body TRS at its 3\u2032 end, would be redirected to the 5\u2032-proximal region of the genomic template by a base-pairing interaction with the leader TRS (L) that (for EAV) has been shown to reside in a leader TRS hairpin (LTH) structure. Following the addition of the anti-leader to the nascent minus strands, the sg-length minus strands would then serve as templates for sg mRNA synthesis.",
