AVN is due to impaired circulation of blood to an area of bone, causing subsequent necrosis (Assouline\u2010Dayan et al. 2002). The condition may be idiopathic or associated with various conditions such as trauma, corticosteroid usage, alcoholism, infections, blood disorders and autoimmune diseases.",

Because of the size of the outbreak, many of the infected employees were referred to three other hospitals in the city for treatment and returned to the CPAF hospital around the end of June 2003 for further recovery. At this time, the first case of AVN was found and it was decided to examine the whole group of patients on the presence of AVN, 71 individuals in total.

Images were taken of hips, knees, shoulders, ankles and wrists. Two musculoskeletal radiologists (one with more than 20 years experience and one with 5 years experience) interpreted the MRI examinations and findings were reached by consensus. Osteonecrosis was defined as a subchondral or intramedullary area demarcated by a distinct T1 hypo\u2010intense marginal rim, and encompassing medullary fat in its centre. The ARCO Classification of osteonecrosis was used to describe the condition of the hip (Gardeniers 1993). Digits in the classification refer to ARCO stage (nature of radiographic findings) and the letters refer to the subclass expressing the location of the lesion and the extension of the lesion under weight bearing dome of the acetabulum on the femoral head (A: medial; B: central; C: lateral); no quantification of abnormality is given. ARCO stages 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B are indicated as moderate, and stages 1C and 2C as severe AVN. Osteonecrosis identified in shoulder, knee, ankle and/or wrist was only classified as positive (osteonecrosis present) and negative (osteonecrosis not present).",

Eight patients required hip replacement surgery. At month 12, another two patients had developed bilateral hip AVN (both with ARCO stage 1A), bringing the percentage with AVN to 42.3%. Between month 12 and month 36 no new instances of AVN were observed. At month 36 however, a total of 10 new cases were found with bone abnormalities in other joints than the hip, and 1 new case with bilateral AVN of the hip (ARCO stage 1A). In addition, four cases with previous hip involvement had developed bone abnormalities in other joints.

In addition, a slight majority of patients (58%) is female. Age and sex distribution is a reflection of the fact that most patients were healthcare workers. About half of the patients (35/71) received a maximal dose of corticosteroids of 320 or 480 mg. Twenty\u2010nine patients received a maximal dose of 160 mg or less, but four patients received extreme high maximal doses of 560 mg or more. The average duration of treatment was 34 days, but varied widely between 1 and 63 days. The average total dose was 6000 mg, again with a wide range between 1100 and 25 000 mg. In eight cases, it was not possible to obtain the initial antibody titre against the SARS\u2010CoV. In the remaining 63 cases, the titres were positive, ranging from 1:20 to more than 1:640. The 10 patients found with AVN in other joints than the hip at the end of the observation period had generally lower treatment indicators (maximal dose, duration of treatment and total dose) than the others. This is not surprising as only individuals with relatively low doses remained to develop AVN in other joints at a later stage.",

Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed on 31 cases that developed moderate and severe AVN in the hip among the cohort of 71 surviving SARS patients. There is no statistically significant (P > 0.05) association between AVN in the hip and age and sex of the patients. The association with log antibody titre is nearly statistically significant (P = 0.06). All factors, however, related to treatment with corticosteroids show a strong association (P < 0.01). Multivariate regression analysis including all three treatment factors, log antibody titre and hospital results in a model with only the total dose (cumulative prednisolone\u2010equivalent dose) remaining statistically significant. In fact, a model only including maximum dose and duration of treatment gives a worse fit of the data (not shown). Repeating the same analysis for those having severe AVN of the hip (n = 11) gives similar results, but with larger confidence intervals. In multivariate analysis, however, maximal dose instead of total dose remains as the statistically significant factor (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.09\u20132.31; P = 0.02). Testing the risk of severe AVN of the hip (n = 11) out of those developing AVN of the hip (n = 31) did not result in a significant factor (not shown), which suggests that the degree of severity of AVN in the hip is random or because of an as yet unknown factor.",

A limitation to this study is the absence of control patients, which is inherent to the fact that the data was from an outbreak situation, which did not allow randomisation of patients receiving treatment or not.

It is known that in general the interval between corticosteroid administration and the onset of symptoms is rarely less than 6 months and may be more than 3 years (Risteli & Risteli 1993), and a median duration of 5.3 months has been reported (Koo et al. 2002).",

Our study, which is also from a hospital in Beijing, reports a prevalence of 39% shortly after the end of the SARS epidemic. In all studies the diagnosis of AVN was based on MRI. The prevalence reported in literature of AVN after corticosteroid treatment is approximately 10% (Mankin 1992; Mulliken et al. 1994). The prevalence reported in our study goes far beyond this figure, certainly when taking into account the new cases of AVN found during the whole follow\u2010up period of 3 years. It is an intriguing question, certainly in the absence of more comprehensive follow\u2010up studies of former SARS patients treated with corticosteroids, how many of these patients still suffer from AVN and the resulting disabilities.

This second group is distinguished from the first group by lower treatment indicators (lower maximal dose, shorter duration of treatment and lower total dose). In the group of 31 cases with AVN of the hip, who were all but one found in the first 12 months of observation, the AVN could be explained completely by the total (cumulative) dose of corticosteroids received. Griffith et al. found the same in Hong Kong (Griffith et al. 2005). In the other study from Hong Kong, high\u2010dose corticosteroids and an extended duration of treatment were shown to be a significant risk factor for AVN (Chan et al. 2006). In the previous study from a Beijing hospital, however, maximum daily dose was shown to be the most significant risk factor. In our study, we found the same when including only the 11 cases with serious AVN of the hip in the multivariate regression analysis.

In the case of SARS, however, a unique disease with which there was no treatment experience at all, it was felt that corticosteroids were necessary to counter the acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients to save their lives. Experience was gained in the course of the epidemic and treatment regimens adjusted accordingly. The use of corticosteroids has been debated, with conflicting opinions about steroids being the key component in the treatment of SARS (Gomersall 2004). It has remained uncertain how the aggressive use of corticosteroids during the SARS epidemic has tipped the balance. Has it saved more lives by applying corticosteroids in high doses? And, do immediate benefits in terms of saving lives weigh against the adverse effects, including AVN? Perhaps the low SARS case fatality in mainland China (about 6%), relative to that in other affected countries and areas (10\u201317%), is to some extent the result of these high\u2010dose treatments (Feng et al., 2009). It has been suggested that randomised controlled trials are performed to solve the issue of effectiveness of corticosteroids in circumstances of an acute respiratory disease. Such research protocols should be pre\u2010developed to be initiated promptly, should SARS or a comparable disease return (Gomersall et al. 2004).",
