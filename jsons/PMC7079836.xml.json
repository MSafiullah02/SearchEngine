In the USA, 19,849, 8000, 3200 and 2449 renal, liver, heart and lung transplants were performed in 2017, respectively (http://www.unos.org/donation). Over the past decades, improvement of graft survival has mainly been attributed to better prevention of acute rejection by immunosuppression therapies. However, these immunocompromised patients are more susceptible to infections caused by both conventional and opportunistic infections, and infection is now the first cause of death of SOT recipients. The diagnosis of infection is often delayed by torpid initial clinical presentation with a secondary and abrupt occurrence of shock and organ dysfunctions. In the present article, we review the main diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to SOT recipients with infections admitted to the ICU.",

            "text": "Infections represent the main cause of death within 1 year after heart or lung transplantation, accounting for 32% and 35% of deaths during this period, respectively. Although with a lesser incidence, infections remain an important cause of death and/or loss of graft survival [1]. The susceptibility of SOT recipients to infections relies on multiple factors including pre-transplant characteristics (i.e., prior immune and non-immune conditions and critical illness), type of transplanted organ, intraoperative characteristics (i.e., prolonged duration of cold ischemia, longer duration of transplant procedure and requirement of blood transfusions) and post-transplant factors (i.e., degree of immunosuppression, prophylaxis and cytomegalovirus infection). Of note, the development of cytomegalovirus infection by itself causes immunosuppression, which further increases the risk of severe bacterial and fungal infections [2, 3]. A timeline of common post-transplant infections has been proposed [4, 5]: severe infections may occur during three classical periods, namely the post-surgical phase (< 4 weeks), the period of maximum immunosuppression (1\u201312 months) and thereafter (> 12 months) [5] (Fig. 1). Increasing indications of organ transplantation are observed with higher age limits and sicker patients [6], accentuating the incidence of post-transplant infectious complications. Pre-transplant critical illness is invariably associated with a higher risk of infection [7] and correlates with the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality [8]. Approximately 6% of lung transplant recipients in the USA are supported by a ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the time of transplant [9]. Recent studies in heart transplant recipients suggest that 25% of patients had ECMO support at the time of transplant [7, 10].",

Risk factors for infection at later time points include vesico-ureteral reflux, polycystic kidney disease, increased albumin excretion and deceased donor kidneys [13]. The most common site of infection is the urinary tract, and abdominal ultrasound is always indicated to identify possible foci for source control such as perinephric abscess, fungal ball or ureteral obstruction. In liver recipients, risk factors are directly related to the allograft anatomy. Pre-transplant conditions such as primary sclerosing cholangitis predispose recipients to postoperative biliary stenosis and anastomotic strictures, both associated with higher risk of bacterial sepsis [14]. The higher the pre-transplant level of bilirubin, the higher the risk of severe infections after transplant. Of note, the Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy is more frequently associated with biliary infections than the duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis for biliary drainage [15]. Clinical presentation includes acute cholangitis, intra-hepatic or abdominal abscesses, secondary peritonitis and bacteremia. The recurrence of hepatic abscess is suggestive of hepatic artery thrombosis, while the development of peritonitis suggests the presence of biliary leakage. In case of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients undergoing liver transplantation with detectable HCV viremia, infection of the allograft within hours of organ transplantation as well as recurrent infection is almost universal. HCV recurrence may be prevented by completed direct-acting antiviral therapy before liver transplantation [16] or, if not feasible, started on the day of transplantation until 4 weeks postoperatively [17]. In heart recipients, the pre-transplant need for ventricular-assist devices, intra-balloon pumps, pacemakers and defibrillators is associated with higher risk of post-transplant mediastinitis, aortic suture infections and dehiscence [18]. In lung recipients, the denervation of the allograft is accompanied by a reduced cough reflex and impaired mucociliary clearance, which in turn increase the predisposition to severe pneumonias and sepsis.",

In heart transplant recipients, a high immunoscore was independently associated with an increased risk of severe infection within the next 3 months [37].

Accordingly, low and high ATP levels have been associated with increased risks of infection and rejection, respectively. However, studies that assessed the performance of ATP levels in identifying infection and rejection risks have been conflicting [40]. Very recently, a global immunity assay was developed to assess the IFN\u03b3 production in whole blood following stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 antibody and of innate cells with the TLR7 ligand R848. The capacity of IFN\u03b3 production was dependent on the type of immunosuppressive regimen and thus was markedly impaired in patients under anti-thymocyte globulin and higher dosing of prednisone and mycophenolate. A low IFN\u03b3 production capacity at 1, 3 and 6 months was associated with the development of further bacterial and opportunistic infections [41]. Further works are needed to characterize individual immune function and to assess the relative risk of specific etiologies of infections.",

As the etiology of ARF in SOT recipients is highly variable, appropriate treatment requires timely and accurate diagnosis, the latter being complex because of the effects of immunosuppression, which obscure the signs and symptoms of infection [49]. In some cases, an invasive diagnostic approach is needed to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes of ARF (Table 2). Infection may be suspected by laboratory and radiographic abnormalities, but the chest X-ray could be normal in as many as 10% of immunocompromised patients with pneumonia, and evidence may only be present on computed tomography. Lung ultrasound is evolving as an accurate bedside diagnostic tool in critically ill SOT recipients [50\u201352]. Flexible bronchoscopy is a useful tool in the evaluation of ARF in SOT recipients, and it should be considered early. Microbiologic sampling in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), biomarker determination in BAL and plasma (procalcitonin, \u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan) and molecular diagnostic tests are useful to drive the antimicrobial therapy in these patients [49, 51]. Additionally, lung biopsy will be needed to discard graft rejection in lung transplant recipients with overlapping clinical features. Respiratory infections heavily impact the final outcome of SOT, increasing morbidity, including chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and mortality. The emergence of MDR pathogens in post-transplantation infections puts SOT recipients at increased risk of threatening difficult-to-treat complications [50, 51].",

Efforts should be made to find the cause of infection [32], with particular attention to differential diagnoses or a surgical cause that would require surgical revisions [56].

Some authors suggest withdrawing immunosuppressive drugs to accelerate sepsis recovery [63]. However, the benefit of this strategy has not been proven yet and may expose the patient to the risk of allograft rejection [64]. Hydrocortisone should be considered in all septic SOT recipients on corticosteroids before ICU admission to avoid adrenal insufficiency [65]. Concerning the choice of fluids, crystalloids should be used as first-line, while colloids such as hydroxyethyl starches, when used in deceased organ donors, have been associated with delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients [66]. Use of vasopressors should also follow current guidelines, where norepinephrine is proposed as the drug of choice [67]. Inotropic drugs should be considered in those who fail to respond to adequate fluids and vasopressors and also have myocardial depression [67]. However, the response to vasopressors may be modified in SOT recipients. For example, some authors have suggested that sympathetic denervation in kidney transplants may increase the effect of norepinephrine on renal vascular resistance [68]. The response to inotropic drugs may also be decreased in heart transplant recipients [68].",

Voriconazole is the standard treatment for CNS aspergillosis but requires therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize therapy and avoid toxicity (optimal trough concentrations of 2\u20135 \u03bcg per ml in serum). Voriconazole has a 50% penetration coefficient in the CNS, and measurement of CSF concentrations is not necessary in routine. For patients experiencing severe adverse effects under voriconazole as primary therapy, liposomal amphotericin B is an alternative. Monitoring of the therapeutic response in patients with altered mental status should be based on serial CT or MR scans with an initial interval of 1 to 2 weeks. Neurosurgery should be consulted for any patient presenting with a suspicion of CNS aspergillosis or other mold infection. In the absence of extra-CNS involvement (i.e., a pulmonary or sinus source of infection), a definitive diagnosis requires brain biopsy, with prompt inspection of the specimen. In patients presenting with space-occupying lesions or hydrocephalus, surgical decompression [with debulking or stereotactic drainage of lesion(s)] and insertion of an extraventricular drainage catheter should be discussed, respectively.",

More than 40% of patients have a disseminated infection, including lung and cutaneous involvement. CNS involvement occurs in one-third of patients and can be asymptomatic, suggesting that systematic brain imaging is mandatory at diagnosis. Cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice, but other drugs such as linezolid, carbapenems and amikacin have been proposed [76]. The most common presentation of Toxoplasma gondii infection in SOT recipients is primary infection with (multi)-organ disease (i.e., retinochoroiditis, pneumonia, myocardial involvement) with or without neurologic features, i.e., meningitis and/or (multi)-focal brain lesions [77].

Curative treatment of CMV disease or CMV organ involvement includes the use of intravenous ganciclovir, duration depending on the clinical picture and kinetics of viral load, but for at least 2\u20133 weeks, and reduction of immunosuppression [46]. The rate of CMV disease has decreased with preventive measures (prophylaxis and preemptive treatment). Prophylaxis, routinely recommended for all transplants from CMV IgG-positive donors (D+) to CMV IgG-negative recipients (R\u2212), consists of valganciclovir or ganciclovir administration during a given period (generally 3\u201312 months, depending on the organ grafted) [46]. Preemptive treatment is based on viral load surveillance (CMV-DNA testing) and treatment when the virus load exceeds a specific threshold. However, thresholds for triggering antiviral therapy are not standardized, but range between 1500 and 4000 IU/ml [1]. This should be adapted according to organ and individual risk. CMV IgG-negative recipients (R\u2212) of organs from negative donors (D\u2212) should not receive prophylaxis or be monitored for CMV reactivation, but tested in case of clinical suspicion [46]. The best strategies (prophylaxis or preemptive treatment) depending on donor/recipient serostatus and transplant types are summarized in Table 1 [46]. Other herpesviridae (HSV, EBV) are less frequent or lead to less severe disease.",

            "text": "SOT is, like other immunosuppressive conditions, a risk factor for severe influenza disease [106]. A recent multicenter study showed that influenza pneumonia was frequent in SOT recipients [107], but its incidence might be decreased, as well as the need for ICU admission, by influenza vaccination and early antiviral therapy [107]. An influenza vaccination strategy should be adapted in SOT recipients: compared with single simple dose, high dose [108] or double dose regimens (given 5 weeks apart) [109] were associated with increased antibody response. Non-influenza respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses) may also be responsible for severe respiratory infection, especially in lung transplant recipients [110, 111], leading in some cases to chronic lung allograft dysfunction [112]. Moreover, it seems that viral-bacterial and/or fungal co-infection is more common than in immunocompetent individuals and that viral shedding is longer in SOT recipients than in immunocompetent patients [111]. Although antiviral treatments are limited and the timing of their administration not clearly defined, all SOT recipients with suspected respiratory infection should be sampled (nasopharyngeal sample or deep lung if mechanically ventilated) to test for these viruses (including influenza) by PCR. Treatment is mainly supportive, but also includes specific antiviral treatment, if available, and reduction of immunosuppression [113]. Empiric oseltamivir should be given in all respiratory infections as early as possible during the flu period in SOT recipients and continued or withdrawn according to PCR results. In case of severe influenza, lung transplant recipients and other particularly severely immunosuppressed SOT recipients (i.e., having recently received anti-rejection therapy and/or anti-thymocytes globulins) should receive a combination therapy including oral oseltamivir and baloxavir. There is no evidence that a double dose of oseltamivir is superior to a single dose; therefore, 75 mg twice daily is recommended for all patients. If oral therapy is impossible, intravenous peramivir is an option. Inhaled zanamivir has not been evaluated in patients with severe influenza and in SOT patients (in particular lung transplant recipients) and could therefore not be recommended for routine use. Intravenous zanamivir may be another alternative, in particular in case of oseltamivir-resistant influenza infections, but is only available for compassionate use. Duration of therapy should depend on therapeutic response and respiratory viral loads measured by PCR: oseltamivir can be stopped after 5 days if there is clinical improvement and virus is no longer detected, but should be continued for 10 days in all other cases, in particular for severe influenza.",

            "text": "Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment and stand out as the most important uncommon pathogens in SOT recipients. Among them, Mycobacterium avium and M. intracellulare [commonly referred as Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)] are the most common NTM species causing disease in SOT recipients [114]. Less commonly encountered NTMs include the slow-growing M. kansasii, M. haemophilum and M. marinum and the rapid-growing M. fortuitum, M. chelonae and M. abscessus. The lung is affected in > 50% of cases, with heart and lung recipients being more vulnerable (range from 0.2 to 2.8% and 0.5 to 8.0%, respectively) compared with kidney (range 0.16 to 0.38%) and liver recipients (0.04%). The median onset is \u2265 1 year post-transplantation, later than tuberculosis [114]. Chronic cough, sputum production and hemoptysis are common in lung infection, whereas disseminated disease (fever, night sweats, etc.) and cutaneous infection are rarer with MAC. Rapidly growing mycobacteria usually cause limited cutaneous disease; M. abscessus and M. chelonae may cause more severe and disseminated diseases [115]. NTM should be suspected in SOT recipients with pulmonary symptoms, particularly lung transplant recipients with chronic allograft dysfunction; all bronchoscopy specimens and all atypical skin lesions should be biopsied, stained and cultured for acid-fast bacilli. Radiology features overlap with many other entities and TB [114]. NTM-associated mortality is generally low, but large studies are scarce. Infections caused by M. abscessus have worse outcomes, particularly in lung transplant recipients, and pre-transplant colonization is considered a contra-indication to lung transplantation by some transplant centers. NTM infections in lung recipients are associated with increased mortality and poor allograft function despite control of the infection [116]. Treatment may be challenged by interactions of rifamycins and clarithromycin, both significant components of NTM treatment regimens, with the calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin [114]. As mentioned above for fungal infections, lowering of the dose of immunosuppressants may trigger IRS with all mycobacterial infections [7].",

Clinical features, severity and duration of infection may vary significantly compared with normal hosts or other groups of immunosuppressed hosts (i.e., HIV patients) [31, 117]. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), rabies virus, Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi (causing Chagas disease), Balamuthia mandrillaris, Encephalitozoon cuniculi (causing microsporidiosis), Strongyloides stercoralis, Echinococcus granulosus, Filariae spp., Schistosoma spp. and Plasmodium spp. can cause donor-derived infections [31, 117, 118]. Most of these infections can present with an aggravated or non-typical course because of immunosuppression, and mortality varies depending on the pathogen, depth of immunosuppression and rapidity of diagnosis. LCMV was transmitted to all organ transplant recipients causing death in seven of eight recipients from the same donor in one report [31]. Most of the above-mentioned pathogens cause geographically restricted infections; therefore, strict screening protocols have to be applied to the donor and/or the recipient, according to their anticipated local exposure to unusual pathogens [119].",
