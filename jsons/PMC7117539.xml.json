The death rate of the pVAX1 and PBS injected groups was 40.0% and 46.67% at 14 days post challenge, respectively. The death rate of the pVAX-F DNA vaccine immunized chickens was only 6.67%, lower than 13.33% of the inactive vaccine immunized chickens. Moreover, the clinical signs and pathological changes of the affected chickens in the inactive vaccine group were more conspicuous and severe than that of affected chickens in pVAX-F immunized group. To evaluate the level of response after challenge, the collected kidney samples were detected by RT-PCR for IBV infection. PCR results indicated that 20.0% and 26.67% of chickens vaccinated with plasmid pVAX-F and inactive vaccine were positive for the presence of virus in the kidney, respectively. All chickens immunized with either empty vector pVAX1 or PBS were positive in RT-PCR test. The group vaccinated with pVAX-F DNA vaccine had the highest rate of protection (80%) in all vaccinated groups. This suggests that the constructed multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine offers considerable resistance against a virulent IBV challenge.",

            "text": "Multi-epitope DNA vaccine, which is a newly-developed DNA vaccine based on both traditional DNA vaccine and polypeptide vaccine, was constructed by significant multi-epitope genes and separated one from another with appropriate spacers [13], [14], [15]. The essence of this technology is that short DNA sequences, encoding well-defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), antibody or helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) specific epitopes are used as immunogens, which is often capable of inducing protection against a large and complex pathogen. Compared to other vaccine strategies, several potential advantages are apparent. First, epitope-based DNA vaccine strategy shows increased \u2018safety\u2019 of an immunisation strategy that mimics antigen processing and presentation during natural infections, without actually causing disease. Secondly, it has the \u2018flexibility\u2019 in epitope selection, which allows induction and optimisation of the desired type of immunity. In addition, the epitope-based constructs appear to be capable of inducing more potent immunoreaction than whole protein vaccines. Furthermore, multiple epitopes derived from more than one antigen can be packaged into a relatively small delivery vehicle, and generate broad responses simultaneously targeting multiple Ags. Finally, epitope-based vaccines may overcome immunodominance and T cell tolerance. Therefore, this paper presented and discussed the construct of chimeric multi-epitope DNA vaccine of IBV and its immune response in chickens. The preclinical studies available to date clearly demonstrated the potential of this vaccine approach in terms of prophylaxis.",

The N protein is highly conserved, highly immunogenic. It induces cross-reactive antibodies and is the most abundant virus-derived protein produced throughout infection [11]. N protein may also induce protective immunity [20]. Moreover, epitopes had been mapped in N protein [11], [21], and one region was identified that induces a T-cell response and also protection [12].

First, the spacers between two authentic epitopes were usually designed as flexibility peptide [22] or prolease recognizing sequence [23] to eliminate interference of two consecutive epitopes. In this study we constructed the GA/GP as spacer between two epitopes which not only minimized junctional epitopes, but also simultaneously optimized for proteosome processing. Secondly, CpG motif in plasmid as well as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) can activate systemic and mucosal immune responses, induce lymphocytes and macrophages to secrete polyreactive antibodies and/or cytokines, and induce proliferation of B-cell [24], [25], [26], [27]. We inserted CpG motif in the multi-epitope chimeric gene to enhance immune response. In addition, the Kozak sequence was also constructed at the 5\u2032 terminal of chimeric gene to improve the expression according to previous study [28].",

Since CD8+ CTL are critical in the control of infectious bronchitis in poultry, and CD4+ T-cell responses may increase the proliferation, maturation and functional activity of CD8+ CTL, providing increased help for B-cells and directly producing antiviral cytokines, the abundantly increased T-lymphocytes in the pVAX-F group may provide a better efficiency of protection.",
