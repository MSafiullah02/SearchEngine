Comparisons between the Sabin strain of type 3 poliovirus, its neurovirulent parent Leon, and a neovirulent revertant isolated from a fatal vaccine associated case of poliomyelitis, suggested that a substitution at position 472 in the 5' noncoding region of the genome was an important determinant of attenuation in the P3/Sabin strain (26) . Subsequent construction of genetic recombinants between the P3/Sabin and P3/Leon strains confirmed that the substitution at position 472 was an important marker of attenuation and identified a second attenuating mutation, a mutation resulting in the substitution of phenylalanine (Sabin) for serine (Leon) at amino acid 91 of the capsid protein VP-3 (27) . Recombinants have also been used to show that mutations within the 5' noncoding region of the Sabin strain of type 1 poliovirus contribute significantly to its attenuation and that a single 10-residue stretch of amino acids in the capsid protein VP-1 is an important determinant of host range in the mouse adapted Lansing strain of type 2 poliovirus (21, 28) .",

We have, therefore, used an alternative approach, namely the characterization of variants with altered pathogenicity. mAbs have been used to select for variants of reovirus (29) and mouse hepatitis virus (30, 31) that were shown to be attenuated . Previously, we described an altered and diminished pattern of diseaese in immunocompetent SJL/J mice infected with such a variant virus (32) . This variant virus (H7A6-2) was selected with a neutralizing mAb H7 . The variant was shown to initiate less inflammatory lesions in the spinal cord and was cleared from the CNS. The observed changes in the pattern of disease may reflect how the immune system interacts with this determinant in the context of virus infection. Alternatively, modifications to structural proteins may effect the ability of the variant virus to infect oligodendrocytes and produce inflammation and concomitant demyelination.",

To determine whether the change in the H7 binding epitope altered the ability of the mAbs to neutralize variant virus, versus parental DA and GDVII viruses, neutralization assays were conducted. Binding of antibody does not necessarily reflect its ability to neutralize infectivity, mAb H7 neutralized only DA virus (Table II) . mAb H5, the negative control that has the ability to bind to DA virus as determined by ELISA did not neutralize any ofthe three virus strains. The ELISA was performed using mAb H5, H7, and H8 and cytoplasmic extracts from cells infected with either the parental DA, the GD-VII, or the variant H7A6-2 for viral antigen . Relative titer in loge mAb H8 neutralized all three viruses, DA, GD VII, and H7A6-2, indicating that mAb H8 and H7 define two different neutralizing epitopes within VP-1 . In contrast to the epitope recognized by mAb H7 that appears to be highly specific for the DA strain, the epitope recognized by mAb H8 appears to be conserved in virus strains with grossly altered pathogenicity and is therefore unlikely to represent an area on the virion surface which is important for pathogenesis . Migrational Characteristics. To determine if a portion of VP-1 from the variant virus H7A6-2 was deleted such as with coronaviruses (Parker, S., and M. J. Buchmeier, manuscript in preparation) or major changes in the migrational characteristics could be observed, the viral capsid proteins were analyzed by PAGE .

Two of the sequence changes (the replacement of a cytosine by a guanine at nucleotide 3429 and the replacement of a cytosine by a thymine at nucleotide 3666) were silent . The remaining three substitutions resulted in the change of a serine to a threonine at amino acid 2 of the capsid protein VP-1 and the change of a leucine to a tryptophan at amino acid 214 of VP-1 . Since the two wild-type DA strains cause a similar disease in SJL/J mice, it is unlikely that these changes are relevant to the pathogenesis of Theiler's virus. Comparisons of the sequence in the region of the genome encoding VP-1 in the parental DA virus strain and the variant virus H7A6-2 showed only one single nucleotide difference at position 3305 (Table IV ) . In addition these data explain why mAb H7 does not react with BeAn or GD VII (Table I) . At this position a cytosine was replaced by a thymine (Fig . 1, resulting in the replacement of a threonine (wildtype) by an isoleucine (variant) at amino acid 101 of VP-1 . Alignment of the DA virus VP-1 sequence with the atomic structure of Mengo virus (33) localized this amino acid modification in the second loop connecting the B and C strands of the 0 barrel of VP-1 (Fig. 2 , left paneo. Model building studies based on sequence alignments and the known structure of Mengo virus suggest that this loop is highly exposed on the surface of the virion (Fig. 2 , right paneo, and previous studies by others (41) have identified this loop as a potential antigenic site in the BeAn Strain of TMEV.",

The second area, nucleotides 410-520 in the 5' noncoding region of the genome, was selected because previous studies (26) had shown that mutations in the 5' noncoding region were important determinants of attenuation in poliovirus .

Therefore, it was necessary to sequence our parental strain in parallel with the variant. Sequence comparisons between our DA strain and a published DA sequence (1) revealed five nucleotide differences . This lead to two amino acid changes within VP-1 and one nucleotide difference within the 5' noncoding region . Even though these nucleotide differences exist between the DA virus of Roos and colleagues (17) and our DA wild-type virus (18) both DA viruses produce a similar disease. In contrast, the disease induced by variant virus H7A6-2 differs markedly from the pathology caused by the parental DA virus strain . The observed nucleotide differences in sequence between these two wild-type DA strains may be attributed to the high frequency of mutations within picornaviruses (42) . Alternatively, at least some of the sequence differences may be ascribed to differences in sequencing techniques. Ohara et al . (1) used complimentary DNA as a template for their sequencing experiments. Our findings were generated from sequence analysis using viral RNA as templates. In both methods, the ability to sequence is dependent on transcription enzymes that have been shown to be error prone.",

This single nucleotide change led to a change in amino acid 101 of VP-1 in which threonine (in the parent) was replaced by an isoleucine (in the variant) . No changes were found near the COOH-terminal trypsin cleavage site of VP-1, close to another neutralizing epitope (1), nor were there any sequence changes in the two other regions of the genome that were sequenced. Since this mutation is the only mutation found in VP-1, and since the mutation results in the loss of the ability of the selecting mAb H7 to bind to the variant virus, it is clear that this single mutation is responsible for neutralization escape . Consistent with the results of the binding and neutralization assays that show that the selecting mAb H7 recognizes only the parental DA strain, the mutation in the variant is located in a region of significant divergence in the known Theiler's virus sequences. Indeed, in addition to substantial sequence differences the GDVII and BeAn strains contain two additional amino acids within this loop containing the mutation (Table IV) .",

            "text": "The modified amino acid is located in the second of two loops connecting the C and D strands ofthe /3 barrel ofVP-1 . This loop (called loop II in the nonmenclature of Luo) (33) is highly exposed on the surface of the virion in a region previously identified as a potential neutralizing epitope in Theiler's virus (41) . The loop is on the periphery of a deep depression (or \"pit\") in the surface of the virion that has been proposed as a probable receptor binding site in Mengo virus (33) and in Theiler's virus (41) . This loop II region containing the observed amino acid difference in the variant virus H7A6-2 is of general importance for picornaviruses . In recombinant studies the same area determines the host range for poliovirus type 2 (28) and is important for neurovirulence ofthe Lansing strain type 2 in mice (21) . Additionally, this structure in poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 has been identified to contain a major neutralizing epitope (43) . Peptides representing amino acids 90-104 ofVP-1 inhibited neutralization of poliovirus type I by a neutralizing mAb. Antigenic poliovirus type 3 mutants resistant to neutralization by different mAbs had single point mutations clustered within this area (44, 45) . The location of the mutation in the variant is consistent either with a mechanism in which the mutation alters the immune response to the virus in such a way that the variant is more efficiently cleared, or with a mechanism in which the mutation alters the ability to bind or infect the target cells for persistent infection (oligodendrocytes?) in the CNS. The question of how a mutation that destroys a neutralizing epitope in vitro causes an enhanced clearance in vivo, leads us to favor the second mechanism (alteration of cell tropism). Indeed, a similar mechanism has been used to explain the observation that sequence alterations in an exposed loop of VP-1 alter host range in poliovirus (21, 28) . This is the first demonstration ofthe epitope being important in the TMEV pathogenesis. The epitope was defined by ELISAs and neutralization assays using mAbs and the exact sequence of the epitope was determined. We describe here a single point mutation within the structural capsid protein VP-1, which alters the pathogenicity of the variant virus. The modified amino acid on loop II of VP-1 is part of a neutralizing epitope as determined by neutralization assays . This epitope has an important in vivo function in determining pathogenesis and neurovirulence. Summary Chronic Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible mice is an animal model for human demyelinating diseases . Previously we described an altered and diminished pattern of central nervous system disease in immunocompe-tent SJL/J mice infected with a variant virus (32) . This variant virus H7A6-2 was selected with a neutralizing mAb recognizing the capsid protein VP-1 of Theiler's virus . Here we characterize the variant virus by ELISA and neutralization assays and by sequencing selected regions of the viral RNA genome and relate the alteration to disease. The variant virus contains one single point mutation within a neutralizing epitope of VP-1. This nucleotide change lead to an amino acid replacement at amino acid 101 ofVP-1, a threonine (wild type) to an isoleucine (variant) . Model building based on sequence alignments and the known structure ofthe related Mengo virus (33) indicates that the altered amino acid is located in an exposed loop on the surface ofthe virus at the periphery ofa site that has been proposed to be the receptor binding site. The results of ELISA, neutralization assay, and direct RNA sequencing provide for the first time an opportunity to precisely map an important structural determinant of neurovirulence.",
