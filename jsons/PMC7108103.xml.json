Because inclusion and exclusion criteria were often defined unclearly or not at all, the risk of bias regarding patient selection was difficult to assess. In at least 37 articles (29.6%), the index test was performed at the point of care, suggesting that index test results were interpreted without knowledge of reference standard results. In 8 of these articles, additional information was available on the clinical feasibility or logistical organization of the test.

Most rapid tests solely detect influenza viruses or RSV. This is historically understandable, because these viruses were considered the most important respiratory viruses. Furthermore, availability of antivirals for influenza renders rapid diagnostic testing of influenza of high priority. However, recent studies indicate that other respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses and hMPV, can also cause severe respiratory illness and are sometimes detected at higher frequencies than influenza and RSV [22, 23].",

For influenza, however, rapid test performance was significantly better in children, as reported elsewhere [24, 25]. Age is inversely associated with viral load, which may explain better test results in children.",
