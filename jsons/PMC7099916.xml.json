            "text": "Healthcare needs grow and healthcare services become larger, more complex and costly (Eveborn et al, 2006; Wand, 2009). Moreover, the intrinsic uncertainty of healthcare demands and outcomes dictates that healthcare policy and management should be based on the evidence of its potential to tackle these stochastic problems. It seems apparent that computer modelling should be valuable in providing evidence and insights in coping with these systems. They can be used to forecast the outcome of a change in strategy or predict and evaluate the implications of the implementation of an alternative policy (Wierzbicki, 2007). The use of modelling in healthcare is not limited to the management of activities necessary to deliver care alone. It is also used for the study of several topics related to healthcare, for example, air pollution, pharmacokinetics and food poisoning. In this paper, we aim at profiling studies that have designed, applied, described, analysed or evaluated healthcare problems with the use of simulation modelling.",

Eldabi et al (2007) reviewed the application of a diverse range of simulation techniques in healthcare settings. Brennan and Akehurst (2000) and Barrios et al (2008) considered the application of simulation in the economic evaluation of health technologies and health products as well as a proposed method for the evaluation of pharmacoecomonic models (Hay, 2004). Dexter (1999) includes a review of computer simulation and patient appointment systems. A number of reviews have focused on the applications of Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) in healthcare in general (England and Roberts, 1978), and more specifically in health clinics (Jun et al, 1999) and healthcare capacity management (Smith-Daniels et al, 1988). Hollocks (2006) gives a personal review of the use of Discrete Event Simulation in health among other fields.",

In order to achieve these objectives, we have conducted a review of 251 articles published during the period 1970\u20132007. The main objective of this review is to offer a broad and extensive picture of the role of simulation techniques in healthcare. To the best of our knowledge, objectives (1) and (2) have not been previously investigated in a single study for all four selected simulation techniques in the health sector, and objectives (3) to (6) have not been presented in a published source\u2014with the exception of England and Roberts (1978) who presented similar results for Discrete Event Simulation and System Dynamics over 30 years ago.

Journal papers included in this study have been selected based on the criteria that the papers report on the use of one or more of these simulation techniques in the healthcare settings. The choice of simulation techniques was made through interaction with experts in this area but was also backed by the review of Jahangirian et al (2009) of simulation in business and manufacturing. The latter identifies the following simulation techniques: DES, SD, ABS, MCS, Intelligent Simulation, Traffic Simulation, Distributed Simulation, Simulation Gaming, Petri-Nets and Virtual Simulation, excluding simulation for physical design. According to this study, the first five techniques were the most commonly presented/used in the selected papers for that review. Initially in our study, we also considered papers that reported on the use of Intelligent Simulation and Parallel & Distributed Simulation. However, these categories were later dropped owing to the fact that only a few relevant papers pertaining to the aforementioned categories were found in our sample study (one or two for each category). Moreover, our choice of simulation techniques is further supported by the study conducted by Fone et al (2003), wherein DES, SD and MCS are discussed as popular simulation techniques in healthcare. Those who wish to have an introduction to the aforementioned techniques can refer to Rubinstein (1981) for MCS, Robinson (1994) for DES, and Sterman (2001) for SD. ABS is the most recent of the four simulation methods used since the mid-1990s. A brief description of ABS is provided below.",

The two authors independently and critically reviewed all the abstracts of 251 papers\u2019 and read the full text when necessary. The appraisal was carried out based on certain inclusion criteria as follows: The selected papers should evidently demonstrate strong relation with the healthcare sector or have an impact on healthcare and use the chosen simulation method to describe, analyse or assess the situation. The paper should include at least one paragraph describing the applied simulation method that was used in the study. Thus, pure physics simulations and human systems simulations did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. The boundaries between health-related papers and non-health-related papers, were not always straightforward. In many papers the impact on human healthcare is provided by a less direct relationship. The reviewers took a flexible approach by including papers in which one could clearly relate the problem described with some kind of health impact. Each of the reviewers assessed all abstracts independently and compared the results were compared. In cases of discrepancies, the full text of the paper was examined and, after discussion between the reviewers, a decision was reached for the paper's inclusion or exclusion. This filtering resulted in a set of 201 relevant papers. The full text papers were collected via online or inter-library loan services.",

Twenty-two studies focused on air pollution [MC3, 10, 20, 26, 29, 40, 43, 51, 55, 79, 88, 90, 97, 102, 114, 124, 126, 132, 133, 135, 136, 140], nine on water pollution [MC21, 62, 76, 93, 95, 98, 103, 116, 127], 11 on food poisoning [MC5, 13, 34, 56, 77, 100, 111, 113, 118, 122, 125] and three on soil contamination [MC119, 128, 142]. In such health risk assessments or epidemiological studies, the exact amount of a chemical or contaminant that an individual comes into contact with over a lifetime should ideally be estimated. However, for many obvious reasons this estimation is difficult. Simulation studies can fill in data gaps regarding historical exposures by generating these data using parametric functions, which are critical to improving the power of such studies. MCS is the method most commonly used for classical probabilistic risk assessments that uses mathematical or statistical models to estimate the frequency in which an event will occur. This technique is particularly useful when a large number of algorithms are required to address various multi-pathways of exposure to humans. The use of Monte Carlo analysis has reformed the practice of exposure assessment and has greatly enhanced the quality of the risk characterisation.",

MCS can be used to determine the Probability of Target Attainment of pharmacodynamic indices by taking the inherent variation of different populations into account. In MCS, the model parameters are treated as stochastic or random variables, by using a probability density function for example, rather than fixed values. The aim of these studies is to establish a population pharmacokinetic model to study the parameters for the drug being administered through an intravenous escalating dosing regimen in healthy subjects, which could, in turn, be used for design of patient protocols with direct therapeutic benefit and maximal safety. These simulations are dependent on the assumptions in the model, including the types and number of subjects in the pharmacokinetic studies and the data used. Differences in pharmacokinetic parameters (for different patient populations) and/or data can lead to differences in the target attainment rates obtained with these simulations. Studies of these kinds usually derive their data from clinical trials.",

            "text": "MCS is extensively used to measure the number and impact of medical interventions for the prevention of disease deterioration or disease transmission. Many intervention procedures with medical treatment show substantial reductions in disease morbidity or mortality. However, their use is expensive and to some extent determined by local practice, with great variation in the rates of these procedures. The optimum level of such procedures may therefore be uncertain, and this uncertainty is a major problem for both clinicians and health service administrators. It is therefore important to have methods that model the requirements for these interventions at the population level by capturing the movement of individuals between different states based on disease and/or procedure history. Such interventions that usually involve patients or disease transmission stages use Markov processes to measure the probabilities of transmission. MCS analysis of the Markov process is the most useful model for this situation, which also allows the enumeration of events as individuals move between states [MC1, 2, 22, 22, 32, 39, 48, 57, 58, 59, 64, 66, 75, 84, 91, 94, 99]. Moreover, there are studies that seek to develop criteria that classify risk factor levels during intervention or treatment outcomes after intervention. In such studies, regression analysis is the most commonly used tool (some others are Bayesian statistics and bootstrapping) that specifies the inclusion criteria or variables. MCS is used in addition to this method to investigate the robustness of these variables or classification criteria [MC49, 74]. Subsequently, in these studies, MCS techniques evaluate the propagation of the variability of input parameters used in regression models by analysing the effects of uncertainty and the intrinsic variability of parameters.",

Certain medical conditions have a profound and growing impact on healthcare resource utilisation. In many circumstances the direct expenditures for screening or treatment (with drugs or other therapy) of these conditions have substantially increased due to the overall ageing of the population. Therefore, research in this field tries to assess the economic value of a population-based screen-and-treat strategy for diseases or medical conditions compared to alternative strategies or no intervention [MC6, 7, 9, 12, 16, 23, 25, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 46, 50, 60, 63, 65, 68, 70, 72, 73, 82, 83, 87, 89, 92, 96, 101, 108, 109, 112, 117, 120, 131, 138, 139]. Briefly, a Markov state transition model with different health states is developed to simulate the medical condition fractures or disease states as a function of demographic change and other influences allowing for a wide variety of scenarios regarding planned medication usage, drug efficacy and individual persistence with treatment. The cost-effectiveness of these alternative strategies is evaluated in an MCS-based incremental cost-utility analysis. The main outcome is usually cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. These results provide policymakers with a common metric for comparing diverse technologies and programmes. Model inputs for the simulation models are usually obtained from published literature and surveys, expert interviews and clinical trials and studies.",

With regard to communicable diseases, SD models were developed to estimate the effect of harm reduction policies for HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (such as \u2018needle-sharing and injection-frequency among drug users and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis control [SD2]) and to assess economic consequences of testing and treating pregnant women for HIV virus with different regimens to avoid prenatal transmission [SD16]. Moreover, SD was used in several studies to evaluate the long-term health impact of smoking by comparing policies such as increasing cigarette excise taxes, raising the legal smoking age to 21 [SD4] and introducing tobacco harm reduction policies [SD8, 9, 11]. They suggested that a large tax increase would have the largest and most immediate effect on smoking prevalence. Control over the cigarette content would bring a net gain in population health, although \u2018healthier\u2019 cigarettes make smoking more attractive and increase tobacco consumption. SD has also been used by health planners to gain a better understanding of diabetes population dynamics [SD7]; to model the feedback effects of reconfiguring health services [SD10] by shifting towards the primary level and bringing services \u2018closer to home\u2019; to investigate the impact of privacy legislation in the individual health insurance market and the social costs that are borne when applicants do not divulge private information about their medical conditions [SD14].",

In this regard, SD also has the potential to simulate multiple, independent key elements of an infrastructure. Innovative modelling and analysis framework based on SD could study the entire system of physical and economic infrastructures, and specifically of healthcare facilities, and propose public responses to infrastructure disruptions [SD5] and disasters [SD1], as well as to reduce the devastating health effects of such phenomena by modelling into a unified whole the relief effort of evacuations, provision of temporary shelters, restoration of electricity and communication lines, etc.",

Six are reported in the MCS category, four in DES and one in SD. However, this is not to say that the case-oriented simulation studies that have not implemented their results have gone astray. Neither should it be implied that their impact is only academic and does not reflect the real world. Looking further at the issue, one may realise that healthcare simulation studies generally have a long gestation period before they reach the ultimate decision makers in a comprehensive format. These decision makers need to decide among a plethora of similar studies, taking into consideration various other factors, and come to a conclusion of turning a specific recommendation from a study into a policy applicable in health organisations and settings. Subsequently, it is unlikely that implementation will be part of the paper.

It is, however, surprising that the oldest paper in our data set is from 1988 as our search strategy concentrated on identifying healthcare simulation papers published from 1970 onwards. One reason for this is possibly that the number of journals indexed by ISI WoS has swelled with the rising popularity of the Internet and the availability of electronic bibliographical information (this may not have been the case during 1970s\u20131980s). Furthermore, it is arguable that although simulation has been applied to manufacturing, defence, supply chains etc., for a long time, its application in the healthcare context is comparatively new. Figure 2 illustrates the historical trends of the healthcare modelling papers for each simulation technique (the only exception is ABS which has only two papers). The ascending lines show the increasing number of published papers in the field especially after the mid-1990s for all three simulation methods. This is in line with the clear increase in simulation usage in the general service sector from the 1990s onwards (Robinson, 2005). Year-to-date figures suggest that this gradual upward trend will continue. It is apparent that during the last 4 years the published papers in this field have drastically increased.

In this category studies pertaining to air and water pollution, food poisoning and soil contamination are leading in terms of published papers, and drug development and dose-response portion studies follow. Cost-benefit analyses health studies with the use of MCS are also popular. They assess the economic value of population-based screen-and-treat alternative strategies for diseases and medical conditions. Some of these studies hold the first positions in terms of research impact and are found to have the maximum average number of citations in our dataset. Moreover, it is particularly noticeable that of the 142 MCS papers, none were published in an OR journal (as defined by the Association of Business School-ABS list). One reason for this may be that MCS is extensively used by health professionals/academics who wish to publish in health-related outlets, or that OR academics have lost interest in the use of MCS and have focused in the use of other simulation techniques to tackle health problems.

A very apparent example is that all simulation techniques deal with screening strategies and cost-benefit analysis of medical interventions. Assuming that the categorisation of papers was made according to the health problem tackled and regardless of the simulation technique employed, the papers of cost-benefit analysis would be at about the same level of the health risk assessment category. However, many researchers will agree that, although the application area is the same, the extent, the level and the detail at which this is examined differs according to the technique employed. SD takes a holistic approach and thus the health problem or situation is looked at from a more global level to a greater extent. Consequently, this technique is appropriate for facilitating health policy making at the macro-level. DES and ABS examine the health problems in more detail (micro-level), taking into account the properties of individual entities, yet this restricts the extent of the system that can be modelled. Therefore, decisions can usually be reached with the use of DES and ABS only at the operational level. Monte Carlo simulation incorporates the random sampling element at aggregated level, which makes modelling of population-based diseases easy to handle. When the individual aspect is important then DES is more appropriate. Moreover, DES and SD are more suitable for modelling problems in which the time element plays a significant role, such as utilisation of health services\u2019 resources and bed/equipment capacity management. Nonetheless, looking at the categories presented in this study, one can see that health risk assessment is pertinent to MCS modelling; planning of health services is most of the times handled with the DES models (and less with SD); and training of health students and managers is prevalent in the SD approach. Unfortunately, we could not make a distinct category for ABS since the sample was so small. Moreover, a year-by-year analysis of the number of papers in each research paradigm showed that there are no chroni gaps in the identified categories, and for that reason published research in these general fields are continuous.",

This may imply that, although authors document the model, the issues they model and the model results, there are few real implementation results to report. England and Roberts (1978) implied that the reasons behind this are either inadequate models that cannot quantify the impact of the human factor, or the diversity of authority in healthcare facilities, which thwarts the simplicity of a single administrative decision to change the system. The latter problem lies mostly in the political sphere. However, governmental bodies and other national or local council/agency fund a considerable number of studies (43% in our review).",

Yet, the ease of use that is offered by COTS simulation packages allows those who are not computer programmers to develop valid simulation models. This gives the opportunity to a number of people, including some stakeholders of the systems under question to engage in modelling and quantify their problems and the impact of alternative actions. However, in this way, limitations to the models are posed not only by the data availability and the computer operating cost but also by the imagination and capabilities of the modeller and the software. Simulation software costs can be high, yet since the mid-1990s, a number of low cost COTS packages have come to the market. The latter have certainly widened access to simulation (Robinson, 2005).",

The implications of this are that there may be an unintentional bias introduced by the specific keywords search and by ISI WoS membership, which leaves out newer journals that have not yet met the \u2018duration of service\u2019 required by the ISI WoS and journals where editorial boards do not wish their journal to have an impact factor. These factors may therefore not be taken into account when basing quality on impact factors. However, the debate as to whether this is right or wrong is outside the scope of this article. We merely wish to provide an analysis of literature within the scope of journals with impact factors and therefore provide some reflection as to the \u2018health\u2019 of healthcare simulation within a potentially metric-driven world.
