Lieutenant Erik Frykberg, a general surgeon, was the chief medical officer on board the USS Iwo Jima. With limited resources and staff, Dr. Frykberg managed all 112 injured survivors. The explosion generated 346 casualties, of whom 234 immediately died. Of the 112 survivors, 96 were injured. Only 19 survivors were critical, defined by an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or greater. The 77 lightly injured survivors (ISS<15) created an overtriage rate (77/96) of 80%. Among the 112 initial survivors, there were 7 additional deaths, all among the 19 critically injured. Frykberg realized that the overall mortality of survivors (7/112 or 6.3%) did not tell the whole story. He concluded that a better gauge of the medical response in a disaster would be the \u201ccritical mortality,\u201d or those deaths occurring among the critically injured as a proportion of all critically injured. Because all 7 late deaths in the Beirut bombing occurred among those with an ISS greater than or equal to 15, the critical mortality was 7/19 or 37%, a statistic undiluted by the majority of survivors who did not have significant injury. Of note within this definition: moribund victims with nonsurvivable injuries are not counted as initial survivors.",

The explanation for this relationship is twofold. First, sorting through numerous victims to find the few critically injured takes valuable time. Second, an excess of patients who have minor injuries or no injuries prevents the DCA from functioning optimally. Predictably, radiology becomes a bottleneck; laboratory results are lost or delayed, phone lines are overloaded, medications are not properly dispensed, charts are incomplete, and staff become stressed and tired. Consequently, although individuals working in the DCAs may be under the impression that they are providing appropriate care, all of these seemingly inconsequential inadequacies conspire to increase the mortality of those patients whose lives hang in the balance and require immediate, uncompromised definitive care for survival.",

Consequently, the insidious distractions and delays that overtriage causes are not overtly obvious to those working in the ORs and ICUs and are virtually incomprehensible to others (eg, the local officials, hospital administrators, prehospital providers, and emergency physicians who are largely responsible for planning the management of the medical response upstream from DCAs).",

Because of its proximity, NYU-DH was flooded with psychologic casualties, the uninjured seeking refuge, people looking for missing colleagues, and critically injured victims brought in by bystanders as well as by ambulance. At BH, many ambulatory victims also arrived for evaluation, but the critically injured were mostly transported by emergency medical services (EMS). At BH, the overtriage rate was 80%, and the critical mortality was 28%, which was similar to the Beirut bombing. At NYU-DH, overtriage was 95%, and the critical mortality was 44%, which are the highest values reported from any disaster to date.",

Thus, prehospital protocols are designed to encourage a degree of overtriage. The intent is to capture all serious injuries while minimizing the opposite result of undertriage and having seriously injured trauma patients inappropriately treated at nontrauma centers. Frykberg recognized that in disaster scenarios the dead may vastly outnumber the injured, and only a minority of those injured are critical (10%\u201315%), so overtriage above and beyond the 50% mark was possible, with potentially deleterious consequences to the survival of the critically injured.",

As one follows the path of the victim from the scene, to field evacuation, to a casualty collection area, to transportation to a medical facility, through the diagnostic areas, and finally to transfer to a DCA, an ongoing process called triage takes place. The etymology derives from the French \u201cto sort.\u201d The decisions surrounding sorting, however, are highly situational. Initial sorting of patients attempts to identify their injury or illness and route them to appropriate care. In addition, when resources are inadequate to meet needs, triage performs a second function: rationing. Rationing is the process by which scarce resources are distributed, ideally in a prioritized manner to the most needy. Rationing is a charged topic for health care in the United States, but it is a long-recognized function of triage; however, rationing is seldom employed, because resources are rarely unavailable. Rationing decisions may occur at each of multiple points between the scene and the DCA: evacuation, first aid, transport, decontamination, admission, transfer, and treatment. If resources at each step are adequate, no rationing takes place; however, in a disaster, the closer one is to the scene when evaluating resources relative to needs, the more likely that rationing must take place.",

Thus, each resource (ventilators, monitors, nursing staff, and so forth) has its own normal, surge, and overflow capacity. For planning purposes, once a single resource of the next level must be employed, the patient should be considered as being treated within the next level's capacity. For instance, managing a critically ill patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (a surge resource) with a 1:4 nursing care ratio (overflow strategy) would be considered as using the hospital's DCA overflow capacity.",

These overflow resources are acceptable and appropriate to treat the large numbers of noncritical victims of any disaster and may be necessary even for critical victims in extreme circumstances.

The most likely disaster scenario from a hazard vulnerability analysis [48] is considered first. The process begins by identifying all the components necessary to provide care to a typical victim. Once normal resources are identified, participants identify surge and overflow resources. At each level of care (normal, surge, overflow), the care-limiting resource is identified. Participants then explore ways to expand that specific resource. The process continues by analyzing the subsequently exposed care-limiting resources. Then the exercise is repeated, assessing the next most likely scenario, and so on. When this process is completed, the group will have generated an inventory of all normal, surge, and overflow resources needed to provide each level of care in the ORs and ICUs. Within each category, a sequence of resource use is defined. For instance, the sequence of locations at Bellevue Hospital (BH) where emergency surgery can be performed (with capacity in parentheses) is as follows:surgery normally performed in ORs (15)surge to day surgery (2), then OB (3)overflow to cystoscopy suites (2), angio suites (2), PACU (12), and ICU (18)\n",

Consequently, we can now immediately increase our ICU capacity from 10 to 18 beds by simply providing additional staffing. We consider these 18 beds our initial ICU surge capacity, achieved through the dual usage of our step-down beds.

With these measures, nurse staffing is our surge capacity-limiting resource. In fact, this is often our normal capacity-limiting resource.
