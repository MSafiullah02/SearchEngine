The 95 tourist hotels are classified into two groups: 31 general tourist hotels and 64 international tourist hotels. International tourist hotels are much more upscale than general tourist hotels and general hotels, providing better quality of facilities, management and service. The first hotel stock traded in the Taiwan stock market was the stock of the Hotel Holiday Garden (international tourist hotel) in 1965. Since then, seven hotel stocks have been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and two hotel stocks are traded in the over-the-counter market.",

Nonetheless, although the financial performance of hotel firms is expected to be closely related to the expansion of inbound tourism, previous research studies have found no significant relationship between tourism expansion and stock performance of hotel firms (Chen, 2007a, Chen, 2007c). Chen (2007a) investigated the impact of some selected economic variables and inbound tourism expansion factor on the stock performance of hotel companies in Taiwan. Hotel stock returns were found to be more sensitive to general economic state variables. Inbound tourism expansion had a positive but not statistically significant effect on hotel stock performance. Similarly, inbound tourism expansion variable could not satisfactorily describe hotel stock returns in China (Chen, 2007c).",

The authors associated the negative impact of three crisis events on hotel stock performance with the decrease in the number of international tourists and thus in hotel sales earnings. This study argues that the plunge in foreign tourist arrivals caused by the three crises not only weakened hotel revenue, but also increased the perceived risk of investments in hotel stocks. Therefore, investors\u2019 perceived riskiness of cash flows from holding hotel stocks soared and led to an upward revision in the discount rate after the three crisis events. This study hypothesizes that the destructive effect of the three crisis events on hotel stock returns could be attributed both to decreased hotel sales earnings and to the increased discount rate (Hypothesis III). Similar to the test of Hypothesis II, whether these three crisis events have a significant influence on risk of hotel stock returns is examined to test the third hypothesis.",

As stated earlier, a time-varying discount rate caused by investors\u2019 changing perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows can still break the link between hotel stock performance and inbound tourism expansion. Nonetheless, as hotel sales revenue deteriorates in economic downturns, the growing inflow of foreign tourist arrivals is very good news during business cycle contraction. The good news from inbound tourism market may have a relatively stronger influence on investors\u2019 perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows holding hotel stocks in business contraction than in business expansion. Thus, while inbound tourism growth cannot significantly affect hotel stock performance as found in previous studies, it may have a strong impact on hotel stock returns during business contraction.",

Indeed, the discount rate used by stock investors reflects investors\u2019 perceived riskiness of stock cash flows from holding stocks. If investors alter their perceptions of the riskiness of a given stock's cash flows, it can cause a changing instead of constant discount rate. Thus, while inbound tourism growth is expected to have a direct influence on hotel sales, it may not significantly affect the discount rate used to discount hotel stock's cash flows, which still can break down the connection between hotel stock performance and inbound tourism expansion.",

Drakos (2004) evaluated the influence of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US on airline stocks listed on different international stock markets. The author illustrated that the risk of airline stocks has soared since September 11, 2001. By using the market model as the relevant return-generating mechanism and event study methodology to determine whether there is a significant change in risk of airline stock returns, he detected a structural break in risk of airline stock returns since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US. He asserted that the increased risk of airline stock returns reflected increased uncertainty surrounding the airline industry.",

As the three events substantially weakened hotel revenue through a sudden drop in inflows of inbound foreign visitors to Taiwan, investors\u2019 perceived riskiness of cash flows of hotel stocks accelerated, resulting in an upward revision in the discount rate. In other words, the unexpected deterioration in the international tourism development can also alter the discount rate used by hotel stock investors. Consequently, not only a sharp decline in expected corporate earnings of hotel industry but also the increased discount rate can lead to poor hotel stock performance.",

Especially, the damage of the SARS outbreak on revenue per available room is more than six times of that of the 9/21 earthquake and more than five times of that of the response to 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US. This result reflects the fact that international tourism expansion in terms of the number of total foreign visitors was the most seriously devastated by the SARS outbreak in 2003 among three unexpected crisis events. Specifically, the quarterly total foreign tourist arrival after the SARS outbreak substantially dropped by 72.48% in just one quarter, from 755,863 in the first quarter to 208,013 in the second quarter of 2003.",

The reaction of risk of hotel stock returns to the SARS outbreak is more than nine and three times of the size of the reaction to the 9/21 earthquake and 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, respectively. These findings are consistent with the anticipation that the bigger damage in the inbound tourism market development caused by crisis events, the less hotel sales revenue and the higher investors\u2019 perceived riskiness of cash flows from holding hotel stocks. To conclude, the poor performance of hotel stocks caused by the 9/21 earthquake and the 9/11 terrorist attacks is mainly due to the impact of both events on hotel sales revenue. This is consistent with the explanations in Chen (2007c) and Chen et al. (2005). In comparison, this study presents new evidence that not only decreased hotel sales revenue but also an increase in the discount rate led to the destructive effect of the SARS outbreak on hotel stock performance.",

Especially, following the valuation relationship given in Eq. (1), if stock investors make an upward revision in their forecast of firms\u2019 earnings and a downward revision in the discount rate due to good news from the inbound tourism market, hotel stock price will soar accordingly. Thus, the positive reaction of hotel stock returns to inbound tourism growth is expected to be stronger in business contraction than in business expansion.

For tourism authorities and hotel business managers, the findings do not only demonstrate the substantial influence of international tourism development on hotel performance, but also suggest that hotel revenue and profitability in Taiwan could suffer during downturns of the tourism industry or low demand for tourism.

On the other hand, they can apply the practical findings in Jang and Chen (2008) as guidelines for diversification or risk management in the Taiwanese tourism market. Jang and Chen (2008) examined how Taiwan can obtain optimal foreign tourist market mixes by minimizing variability in foreign tourist arrivals based on the financial portfolio theory.

This crisis management can help sustain the confidence level of safety and security of travelers by reducing the uncertainty in the tourism market and hence avoid a decline in foreign tourist arrivals during crisis period. Further, as Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) noted, although marketers believe that price is a critical factor in destination recovery, this may not be always true. Hotel business managers need to know that low-cost tour packages did not motivate tourists to visit the affected destination (Rittichainuwat, 2006). Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) stated that discounting may create a negative image of low-cost travel destinations and it could be hard to alter the negative image after the destination has fully recovered.
