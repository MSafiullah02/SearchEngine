Many structures are involved in the vomiting process. These include the emetic center located in the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata, the chemoreceptor trigger zone located on the floor of the fourth ventricle within the brain, and the vagal and sympathetic neurons stimulated by receptors in the abdominal viscera.2 Activation of the vomiting reflex can occur for many reasons. These include local or systemic inflammation, irritation, distention, hypertonicity, emetogenic substances including toxins and medications (eg, apomorphine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, some antineoplastic agents), and impulses that arise from the vestibular center because of motion sickness.3\n",

The diagnostic dilemma is to unveil the inciting cause, treat and correct it, while at the same time treating all secondary complications related to the vomiting. In cats, vomiting is a particularly common and complex problem. Adult cats often have different and more chronic causes of vomiting than kittens. Nonetheless, the condition remains a common reason for cats to be presented for veterinary care.5 In domestic cats, vomiting is caused by primary gastrointestinal diseases and extragastrointestinal diseases. Examples of primary disease include infectious, inflammatory, parasitic, obstructive (foreign body, trichobezoar, worm impaction), drug-related, or nutritional. Extragastrointestinal causes include endocrinopathies (eg, hyperthyroidism); metabolic disease (eg, renal failure); inflammatory diseases; and other disease processes, such as hepatopathy, pancreatitis, or neoplasia (especially alimentary lymphoma). This wide spectrum of potential causes of vomiting in cats increases the difficulty for the practitioner in making a definitive diagnosis.6\nBox 1Common causes of vomiting in dogs and cats\nAbdominal, Alimentary Disorders\u2022Infections bacterial, fungal, viral\u2022Inflammation: gastritis, enteritis, gastroenteritis, pancreatitis\u2022Neoplasia\u2022Toxicity\u2022Obstruction\u2022Ulceration\u2022Intussusception\u2022Foreign bodies\u2022Motility disorders\nMetabolic disorders\u2022Uremia\u2022Liver failure\u2022Electrolyte disorders\u2022Acid-base disorders\nSystemic Disorders\u2022Sepsis\u2022Endotoxemia\u2022Multiple organ failure\nExogenous Medications\u2022Erythromycin and other antibiotics\u2022Chemotherapy drugs\u2022Apomorphine\u2022\u03b12-Agonists: xylazine, medetomidine, dexmedetomidine\u2022Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: ketoprofen, meloxicam, carprofen\nOther Abdominal Disorders\u2022Septic peritonitis\u2022Uroperitoneo\u2022Pyometra\u2022Hemoperitoneo\u2022Dietary indiscretion\u2022Food hypersensitivity reactions\nEndocrine Disorders\u2022Diabetes mellitus (ketoacidosis)\u2022Hyperthyroidism\u2022Hypoadrenocorticism\nNervous System Disorders\u2022Encephalitis/meningitis\u2022Hydrocephalus\nToxicity\u2022Ethylene glycol\u2022Heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead)\u2022Strychnine\n",

            "text": "Diarrhea is the result of excess fecal water that may be from decreased intestinal absorption, increased intestinal secretion, or both. Most cases of diarrhea are mild and self-limiting requiring minimal diagnostic testing and symptomatic care, but for more severe cases, diagnostic testing and intensive therapy are warranted (Box 2\n). Small intestinal diarrhea typically results in a larger fecal volume and fluid, electrolyte, and protein loss, and acid-base abnormalities. Large bowel diarrhea is characterized by small volume, multiple defecations, with feces of a soft consistency, and the presence of mucus or fresh blood. Tenesmus may or may not be present. It is important to differentiate small bowel versus large bowel because it has a significant impact on the diagnostic and treatment plan. Most commonly, the duration of the diarrhea is subjectively classified as acute (<14 days) or chronic (>14 days). The mechanism of diarrhea in the feline and canine patient is divided into four subcategories and these can occur alone or in any combination: (1) secretory diarrhea, (2) osmotic diarrhea, (3) increased intestinal permeability, and (4) abnormal gastrointestinal motility.7, 8 Secretory diarrhea results when there is a disturbance to the ion pumps in the gastrointestinal epithelium caused by bacterial endotoxins. When there is compromise to the gastrointestinal mucosa from gastrointestinal mucosal erosions (eg, severe shock, toxins, hyperthermia, foreign body) or blunting of villi (eg, viral or bacterial pathogenic agents) there is fluid loss. Diarrhea can occur via any or all of these mechanisms. For example, the presence of cellular debris in the intestinal lumen contributes to osmotic diarrhea, hypomotility results in ileus and increased permeability, and endotoxins represent ion pump inhibitors resulting in secretory diarrhea. The presence of frank red blood (hematochezia) or black tarry stool (melena) should alert the clinician that there is a disruption to the integrity of the gastrointestinal epithelium and protein loss, and bacterial translocation should be anticipated. In conclusion, the gastrointestinal patient suffers from malaise and anorexia that decreases water and caloric intake, vomiting and diarrhea that results in fluid losses, and occasionally pancreatitis or peritonitis that results in redistribution of fluid and consequently leads to a negative fluid balance.9 It is imperative that these conditions and their sequelae are treated promptly and appropriately via fluid therapy to optimize a successful outcome.Box 2Common causes of diarrhea in dogs and cats\nAlimentary Disorders\u2022Food indiscretion\u2022Hypersensitivity\u2022Food allergy\u2022Food poison/toxicity\u2022Food change\u2022Excess of food\u2022Trash consumption\nMetabolic/Inflammatory disorders\u2022Stress\u2022Sepsis\u2022Inflammatory bowel disease\u2022Pancreatitis\u2022Lymphangiectasia\u2022Stress colitis\u2022Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis\u2022Hepatitis\u2022Cholangiohepatitis\u2022Chronic kidney disease\u2022Hyperthyroidism\u2022Hypoadrenocorticism\u2022Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency\nNeoplastic Disorders\u2022Carcinoma\u2022Lymphoma\u2022Intestinal stromal tumor\nMedications\u2022Laxatives\u2022Chemotherapy\u2022Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\u2022Antibiotics\nInfectious\u2022Virus: parvovirus, coronavirus, distemper, rotavirus, feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency\u2022Parasites: giardia, helminths\u2022Bacteria: Campylobacter, Clostridium, Salmonella, Escherichia coli\n\n",

An estimate of dehydration is achieved by means of the physical examination, but factors that influence accurate assessment exist, such as age and body condition. For example, the older cachexic animal has less skin elasticity and fat compared with the obese pet that has additional lubrication between tissues. Because of these variables, it is best to assess the hydration status via a skin tent over the dorsum of the neck or on the lateral thorax.11 BW seems to be the most objective marker of hydration status. Having a recent past BW is most useful in determining the degree of fluid loss. A loss of 1 mm of water is equivalent to 1 g; therefore, a loss of 1 kg suggests a loss of 1000 mm of body water.12 Animals with hyporexia and anorexia may lose approximately 0.1 to 0.3 kg BW/day/1000 kcal of energy requirements.12 An exception occurs in the case of third spacing when there is loss from the circulating volume and no appreciable loss in BW.",

Fortunately, this is typically corrected by use of adequate fluid therapy with a balanced isotonic alkalinizing crystalloid, such as lactated Ringer solution or Plasmalyte.11 It is worth mentioning that pyloric foreign bodies and gastrointestinal obstructions that are localized to the proximal duodenum can result in metabolic alkalosis. If this acid-base derangement is noted, 0.9% saline is recommended. Metabolic acidosis or normal acid-base status can also occur with this condition, which underlines the importance of obtaining laboratory diagnostic tests.",

            "text": "Isotonic crystalloids are the mainstay treatment of most gastrointestinal disorders. This kind of fluid has an osmolality similar to that of plasma and the extracellular compartment. Sodium has the largest effect on the fluid osmolality because of its having the highest concentration in the extracellular fluid compartment.11, 14 Water follows sodium. Because of this intimate relationship, the sodium concentration of the fluid is important in selecting the appropriate fluid to treat a condition. The constitution of a fluid, with buffers and electrolytes, is also a consideration in making an adequate fluid choice. In general, vomiting and diarrhea result in isotonic dehydration, and the serum sodium concentration is within the normal reference range. A replacement fluid should be chosen that is nearly physiologic in sodium concentration and osmolality: a sodium concentration of 130 mEq/L to 154 mEq/L (Table 3\n). If there is a change in the sodium concentration from the normal reference range, then an appropriate fluid should be chosen. If the deficit occurs acutely, the derangement can be corrected acutely, but if it is chronic then it must be corrected slowly over time. If the serum sodium concentration is increased, the patient has hypertonic dehydration and needs more water than salt for replacement. Examples of hypotonic fluids are 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline in 2.5% dextrose. Correction of hypernatremia should not occur any faster than 0.5 mEq/L/h to avoid central pontine myelinolysis.9 With hypotonic dehydration, the serum sodium concentration is low and the patient needs more sodium relative to water.",

Oral fluid therapy should be reserved for the euhydrated patient that is not vomiting. Electrolyte solutions should be administered at frequent intervals to provide for adequate daily requirements. Promising preliminary data indicate the benefit of oral electrolyte solutions for rehydration in pets with mild to moderate diarrhea. These are safe, effective, and more cost- and time-effective, but further studies are needed.15 Subcutaneous fluid therapy is used to treat the patient with normovolemia with mild to no evidence of dehydration. A balanced isotonic polyionic crystalloid should be chosen and the amount of fluid administered at each injection site should not exceed 20 mL/kg. The flow of the fluid is determined by the pet\u2019s comfort and is generally absorbed within 6 to 8 hours. If fluid pockets persist after this time frame, intravenous fluid (IVF) administration should be implemented to re-establish peripheral perfusion. Avoiding the subcutaneous use of acetated polyionic solutions, such as Normosol\u2013R and Plasmalyte, is recommended because these result in patient discomfort. IVF therapy should always be chosen for the dehydrated patient. IVF allows for rapid and accurate administration of volume resuscitation. Hypokalemia is a common finding in the vomiting patient and thus IVF allows for adequate and safe potassium supplementation and delivery. Intraperitoneal and intraosseous routes are not commonly used and reserved for patients in which access to IVF therapy is unsuccessful or not feasible.",

In the dog this is 80 mL/kg, in the cat this is 65 mL/kg. The choice of fluid depends on acid-base status. If the pet is acidotic, use a balanced electrolyte solution; if the pet is alkalotic, use 0.9% saline.
