            "text": "Turkey coronaviral enteritis is an acute and highly infectious disease, which has contributed to significant economic losses in the US turkey industry, particularly in Indiana and North Carolina, for the last decade [1], [2]. The clinical signs (diarrhea, decreased body weight gain, inappetence, and ruffled feathers) of the disease usually appear in turkey poults at 7\u201328 days of age. The morbidity is usually high and the mortality varies. In an epidemiological study, turkey coronavirus (TCV) was identified in 63% of poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS)-affected flocks in North Carolina (Guy and Barnes, unpublished data). The coronavirus isolated from affected turkey flocks was found to be antigenically cross-reactive with antibodies specific to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a chicken coronavirus [3].",

Although the detailed mechanisms for such protection are not clear, the protective immunity induced by the corresponding coronavirus during the primary infection is essential. Both serum IgG and fecal IgA antibody responses increased following secondary exposure with BCV. The virus-neutralizing antibody responses in serum were also increased following secondary challenge with BCV [6], [9]. The presence of high numbers of antibody-secreting cells and high lymphocyte proliferation activity was correlated with protection against subsequent challenge of TGEV [7]. Antibody responses to IBV were detected in serum, tracheal washes, and tears of chicken infected with IBV. Vaccination studies on IBV generally correlated neutralizing serum antibody responses to protection [10].",

            "text": "Turkey flocks recovered from coronaviral enteritis (bluecomb disease) may develop life-long immunity against challenge infection [11]. However, the nature of such resistance is not completely understood. Serum from recovered turkeys could neutralize the infectivity of TCV-containing intestinal contents [11], [12]. Serum antibodies to TCV were detectable by immunofluorescent antibody assays (IFA) from 9 to 160 days post-infection (PI) [13]. Antibodies to TCV in the intestine and bile were detectable by immunodiffusion test [14] or a sandwich IFA [15] up to 6 months PI. The lymphocyte proliferation responses to mitogen was reported to be enhanced in turkeys infected with TCV [16]. In addition, sequential kinetic studies of humoral and cellular immune responses of turkey poults infected with TCV isolated in our laboratory have shown that activation of specific immune responses (humoral and cellular) are associated with the decrease of TCV antigens in turkey intestines (unpublished data). However, which immunity, humoral or cellular, provides the necessary protective immunity for turkey poults against infection with TCV is not clear. Such information is critical in developing strategies for the diagnosis, control, and prevention of turkey coronaviral infection in turkey flocks.",

Heparinized blood was diluted at 1:40 and dispensed in a 96-well plate. To each well of three sequential triplicate cultures were added 100 \u03bcl of RPMI medium without mitogen or containing 40 \u03bcg/ml of concanavalin A (Con A) (Sigma). Cell cultures were incubated at 41 \u00b0C for 48 h in a humidifying air atmosphere at 5% CO2. Cultures were pulsed with 1 \u03bcCi of 3H-thymidine in 50 \u03bcl of RPMI medium per well for the final 5 h of incubation. Cells were harvested onto glass filter papers with an automatic cell harvester (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). The counts per minute (CPM) values of individual cell samples were measured in a Packard TopCount Scintillation Counter (Model B9904, Packard). The CPM values of the triplicate cultures within each sample were averaged. Stimulation index (SI) was calculated by dividing the average CPM value in mitogen-stimulated cultures by the average CPM value in unstimulated culture.",

The IFA used for detection of TCV was described previously [13]. Briefly, intestines were frozen immediately at \u221220 \u00b0C and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN). Intestinal sections were cut serially with a cryostat into 6 \u03bcm thickness pieces and fixed in absolute acetone for 10 min. Tissue sections were incubated with turkey antisera specific for TCV [2], [3] at a dilution of 1:40 in dilution buffer containing 150 mM phosphate buffer, 0.85% NaCl, 1% BSA, and 0.02% Tween-20 in a humidifying chamber at room temperature for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS buffer, intestinal sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated goat anti-turkey IgG (H+L) antibodies (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:40 in dilution buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Slides were coversliped and examined on a fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The IFA staining positive for TCV antigen appeared in the cytoplasm of enterocytes. The intensity of IFA staining was scored on a scale of 1\u20134 with 4 being the most intense staining. The distribution of area with positive staining within section was categorized into diffuse, multifocal, and focal and scored as 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The scores of intensity and area distribution were added. The final value indicated the overall amount of staining in a section, with higher value indicating more positive staining. The consistency of IFA is assured by inclusion of positive controls with intestinal sections from turkey embryos infected with TCV and negative controls with intestinal sections from normal turkey embryos in the assay.",

These data suggested that B cells were the major targets of CY in turkey poults.

Chickens treated with CY had longer persistence of IBV and, subsequently, showed increased clinical signs and more severe histopathological lesions in the kidney. High titers of humoral antibodies were correlated with the absence of virus recovery from kidney and genital tract and seemed to protect the tracheal epithelium from challenge infection. Spike protein of IBV was considered the major structural protein that induces protective humoral antibody responses.

For detection of TCV in the intestine by IFA, the time point of 10 h PI in trial 1 was not repeated in trial 2 because significant difference in the amount of staining between groups at this interval was not observed in trial 1. The difference in the amount of staining between groups at 10 h PI was not expected in trial 2 as suggested by the similar amount of staining among groups at 3 days PI in trial 1. In contrast, the time point of 9 days PI in trial 1 was changed to 14 days PI in order to examine if there were greater differences between groups treated with CsA or CY and group not treated with CsA or CY.",

The level of TCV antigen declined after 7 days PI while the virus-specific antibody responses rose markedly (Loa et al., unpublished data), suggesting the protective role of humoral immunity against TCV infection in turkey poults. Consistent with these observations, the results of the present study also revealed the declines of TCV antigens in the intestines of turkey poults not treated with CsA or CY at 9 and 14 days PI. In addition, the present study showed that suppression of humoral immunity by CY enhanced the severity of TCV infection in the intestines of turkey poults infected with TCV. In summary, significantly decreased body weight gain along with increased severity of TCV infection in turkey poults treated with CY and infected with TCV suggest that humoral immunity may provide protective immunity for turkey poults against infection with TCV.",
