By the age of 1 year, 50% to 65% of children will have been infected with this virus and by the age of 2 years, nearly 100% 23 Children aged 4 months and born close to the onset of the viral season are most prone to the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms, 24, 25 and this is likely to be due to a developmental component (e.g. airway, lung parenchyma, and/or immunologic maturation). 23 Furthermore, infant birth 4 months before the winter virus peak predicts an increased likelihood of developing childhood asthma. 24 Additional risk factors for bronchiolitis include antiviral immune responses (both innate 26 and adaptive 27 ), gender, lung size, and passive smoke exposure. 16 Several large, long-term prospective studies of children have demonstrated that RSV bronchiolitis is a significant independent risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma, at least within the first decade of life. 12, 28 A longitudinal, population-based cohort study has demonstrated that the association between RSV LRIs and both frequent (>3 episodes) and infrequent wheezing (<3 episodes) decreased markedly with age and becomes nonsignificant by the age of 13 years. 12 A decrease in the frequency of wheezing with increasing age after documented RSV infections has been observed by other investigators as well. 29, 30 These data suggest that although RSV infections contribute substantially to the risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma in early childhood, other cofactors (e.g. genetic, environmental, developmental) also contribute to the initial expression of asthma or modification of the phenotype over time.",

            "text": "Although a bronchiolitis diagnosis during infancy is associated with an approximately 2-fold increased risk of early childhood asthma, this risk differs by season of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis occurring during HRV-predominant months (spring and fall) was associated with an estimated 25% increased risk of early childhood asthma compared with RSV-predominant (winter) months. However, the proportion of associated asthma after winter season bronchiolitis is greater than HRV-predominant months because of higher rates of bronchiolitis during the RSV season. 31 Another study by Kuesel and coworkers demonstrated that although RSV was associated with more severe LRI requiring hospitalization, HRV was associated with more than three times the number of both wheezing and nonwheezing LRI in infancy. These findings support the concept that HRV is also an important cause of bronchiolitis and appears to be most indicative of the risk for developing asthma. 11 Respiratory infections can cause wheezing illnesses in children of all ages and also may influence the development and severity of asthma. Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, 1-3 chlamydia 4-7 or mycoplasma 5, [8] [9] [10] have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. Of these respiratory pathogens, viruses have been demonstrated to be epidemiologically associated with asthma in several ways ( Figure 35-1) . First, certain viruses associated with infantile wheezing have been implicated as potentially being responsible for the inception of the asthmatic phenotype. 11, 12 Second, in children with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) play a significant role in producing acute exacerbations that may result in healthcare utilization. [13] [14] [15] Furthermore, children who develop severe viral respiratory infections in the first 3 years of life are more likely to have asthma later in childhood. 3, 11, 16 Several host factors, including respiratory allergy 13, 17 and virus-induced interferon responses [18] [19] [20] modify the risk of virus-induced wheezing. Treatment of virus-induced wheezing and exacerbations of asthma can be challenging and studies evaluating current treatment strategies are reviewed. For infections with other microbial agents, attention has focused on chlamydophila and mycoplasma, 5, 7 as potential contributors to both exacerbations and the severity of chronic asthma. Finally, colonization of the upper airways in infancy with common bacterial pathogens has been associated with increased risk of subsequent asthma. We review these various associations as they pertain to both the pathogenesis and treatment of childhood asthma.",

David Strachan first noted that the risk of the development of allergies and asthma is inversely related to the number of children in the family, 43 an observation that has been duplicated in a number of subsequent studies. [44] [45] [46] This finding has led to speculation that infectious diseases, which are more likely to be transmitted in large families or daycare centers, 47, 48 could modulate the development of the immune system in a manner to reduce the chances of developing allergies. This hypothesis implies that the immune system is skewed toward a T helper cell type 2 (Th2)-like response pattern at birth. In support of this concept, there is experimental evidence to show that Th1-like interferon responses are depressed at birth 49 and are more likely to be depressed in children who develop recurrent wheezing. 20 According to this hypothesis, each viral infection would provide a stimulus for the development and/ or activation of Th1-like immune responses. The result of this repetitive stimulation would be to change the polarization of the Th system away from a Th2 overexpression and thus reduce the risk for developing allergies (Figure 35-2) .",

Prospective studies of subjects with asthma have demonstrated that up to 85% of exacerbations of wheezing or asthma in children are caused by viral infections. 15 Although many respiratory viruses can provoke acute asthma symptoms, HRVs are most often detected, especially during the spring and fall HRV seasons. In fact, the spring and fall peaks in hospitalizations because of asthma closely coincide with patterns of HRV isolation within the community. 14 HRV infections are frequently detected in children older than 2 years who present to emergency departments with acute wheezing 13 and in children hospitalized for acute asthma. 34 A newly discovered HRV species, HRV-C, is associated with asthma exacerbations in children during the fall and winter.

Of the asthmatic patients, 56% had a positive PCR for M. pneumoniae (N = 25) or C. pneumoniae (N = 7), which was mainly found in lavage fluid or biopsy samples. Only 1 of 11 control subjects had a positive PCR for Mycoplasma. A distinguishing feature between patients with positive and negative PCR results was the significantly greater number of tissue mast cells in the group of patients who were positive on PCR. Cultures for both organisms were negative in all patients, and serologic confirmation correlated poorly with PCR results. In another study by Biscardi and colleagues, 119 children, aged 2 to 15 years, with a previous history of asthma and hospitalized for a severe asthma exacerbation were tested for acute infection due to M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae determined by positive results of serologic testing. Nasopharyngeal aspirate PCR was also performed. Acute M. pneumoniae infection by positive serology was found in 20% and C. pneumoniae infection was found in 3.4% of the patients during the current exacerbation. Of 51 patients experiencing their first asthma attack, acute M. pneumoniae infection was proven in 50% of the patients and C. pneumoniae in 8.3%. Of the children experiencing their first asthma attack and infected with M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, 62% had asthma recurrences but only 27% without these infections had asthma recurrences. 9 Similar to the previous study, serologic confirmation correlated poorly with PCR results. Chronic chlamydophila infection may possibly promote ongoing airway inflammation that increases susceptibility to other exacerbating stimuli such as viruses, allergens, or both.",

In one study, roxithromycin was administered for 6 weeks to a group of adult asthmatic patients who had serologic evidence of concurrent infection with C. pneumoniae and a small but significant improvement was observed in both morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates; however, these improvements were not sustained several months after the discontinuation of therapy and no control group was included. 57 In a pediatric trial, 71 children aged 2 to 14 years with an acute episode of wheezing and 80 age-matched healthy children were studied. Sera for specific antibody levels and nasopharyngeal aspirates for the PCR detection of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were obtained on admission and after 4 to 6 weeks. All children with wheezing received a standard therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators for 5 to 7 days and 30.9% received a 10-day course of clarithromycin irrespective of serological and PCR results, on the judgement of the pediatrician in charge. During the 3-month follow-up period, among children with evidence of acute M. pneumoniae and/or C. pneumoniae infection, significantly more (69.2%) nonantibiotic-treated subjects showed recurrence of wheezing; conversely, none of the lifestyle, alterations in bacterial flora of the gut, and increased use of antibiotics. 50 Furthermore, exposure to high levels of endotoxin in the home, such as occurs in farmhouses, is associated with reduced rates of allergy and an enhanced number of interferon-producing cells in peripheral blood. 51, 52 Collectively, these studies suggest that exposure to microbes may have a greater effect than actual infections on immune development and the risk of atopy and asthma. Other epidemiologic and biologic factors that have been considered to influence the development of allergic sensitization and/or asthma are reviewed in detail in Chapters 2 and 6.",

Children who reported multiple episodes also tended to remain PCR positive for C. pneumoniae, suggesting chronic infection.

First, viral infections damage airway epithelial cells and can cause airway edema and leakage of serum proteins into the airway. These effects, together with shedding of infected cells into the airway, can lead to obstruction and wheezing. In addition, virus-induced immune responses are necessary to clear clarithromycin-treated patients showed a new episode of wheezing. 10 To date, the data are difficult to interpret because of the limited number of studies, difficulty in eradicating Chlamydia and Mycoplasma infection, and the fact that many of the macrolide antibiotics have antiinflammatory effects in addition to serving as antimicrobials. 58 If C. pneumoniae infection does indeed contribute to asthma chronicity, disease severity, and instability, what mechanisms may contribute to these effects? In this regard, some investigators have proposed that the development of C. pneumoniae-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody causes the release of mediators that lead to bronchospasm, airway inflammation, and airway reactivity. 59 Unless the organism was eradicated with antibiotic therapy, antigenic stimulation leading to specific IgE production would persist, thereby explaining the protracted course of asthma in some patients that is unresponsive to the aggressive use of bronchodilators and steroids. 59 In addition, as indicated previously, a major C. pneumoniae antigen is heat shock protein 60 (cHSP60). This protein has been implicated in the induction of deleterious immune responses in human chlamydial infections and has been found to colocalize with infiltrating macrophages in atheromatous lesions. Recently, cHSP60 was found to be a potent inducer of macrophage inflammatory responses mediated through the innate immune receptor complex TLR4-MD2 (Toll-like receptor 4). 60 These latter findings suggest that chronic asymptomatic chlamydial infections may perpetuate ongoing airway inflammatory responses through both innate and adaptive immune responses.",

Children with acute M. pneumonia have an elevated interleukin (IL)-4/interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 ratio compared with children with pneumococcal pneumonia or controls, 63 and mice experimentally infected with M. pneumoniae develop airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), which is associated with decreased production of mRNA for IFN-\u03b3. 64 In addition, asthmatic patients with M. pneumoniae infection detected by PCR have elevated levels of neurokinin 1, which responds to treatment with a macrolide antibiotic. 65 One additional mechanism implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic asthmatic symptoms is latent adenovirus infection. 55 A latent infection occurs when a virus incorporates itself into the host cell DNA and continues to periodically express viral genes.

For example, RSV infection activates signaling pathways in airway epithelial cells through the innate immune system through Tolllike receptor-4. 78 Apart from receptor activation, the development of oxidative stress during viral infections can activate epithelial cell responses. 79 Viral RNA binds to cell surface receptors (Toll-like receptor-3) 80 and intracellular proteins, such as the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase and retinoic acid-inducible gene I, to activate the innate antiviral immune response. 81 Through these pathways, viral replication stimulates the production of nitric oxide, activation of RNase L, and inhibition of protein synthesis within infected cells. In addition, innate antiviral responses induce chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells into the airway. 82 HRV-infected epithelial cells secrete RANTES and IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP)-10, which induce T cell chemotaxis. 83 Notably, IP-10 expression is augmented in asthma exacerbations caused by HRV and other viruses, and the level of IP-10 expression has been reported to differentiate between virusinduced and nonvirus-induced asthma exacerbations. 83 Finally, viral respiratory infections can induce the synthesis of many of the factors that regulate airway and alveolar development and remodeling, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide (NO), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).

Moreover, HRV appears to replicate equally well in cultured epithelial cells derived from either upper or lower airway epithelium. 70 Finally, HRV has been detected in lower airway cells and secretions by several techniques after experimental inoculation. [71] [72] [73] Titers of infectious virus in lower sputum reach or exceed those found in nasal secretions in some individuals. 73 In addition to evidence from experimental infection models, HRV is frequently detected in infants and children with lower respiratory signs and symptoms, including children hospitalized for pneumonia. 74 Collectively, these findings suggest that respiratory viruses, including HRV, are likely to cause wheezing illnesses and exacerbations of asthma mainly by infecting lower airways and causing or amplifying lower airway inflammation.",

The resultant epithelial damage can also increase the permeability of the mucosal layer, 75 which may facilitate contact of irritants and allergens with immune cells, leave neural elements exposed, and enhance viral replication in less differentiated basal epithelial cells. 76 The processes associated with viral replication trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses within the epithelial cell.

The mechanism of virus-induced airway responsiveness is likely to be multifactorial, and contributing factors are likely to include impairment in the inactivation of tachykinins, virus effects on nitric oxide production, and virus-induced changes in neural control of the airways. 121 Tachykinins, which are synthesized by sensory nerves, are potent bronchoconstrictors and vasodilators and, through these effects, have the potential to cause severe airway obstruction. Because airway epithelial cells help to regulate tachykinin levels through the production of the enzyme neutral endopeptidase, loss of this enzyme activity in epithelium that has been damaged by viral infection could lead to airway obstruction. 122 Nitric oxide can regulate both vascular and bronchial tone and can interfere with the replication of some viruses. 86 Nitric oxide synthesis is enhanced by viral infections. 123 but because of the many potential effects of nitric oxide on the lower airways, it is uncertain as to whether this is beneficial to lower airway function in asthma.",

Notably, viral infections and allergic inflammation synergistically enhanced the risk of wheezing. Furthermore, experimental inoculation with HRV is more likely to increase airway responsiveness in allergic individuals compared with nonallergic individuals. 115 Lastly, the risk of hospitalization among virus-infected individuals is increased in patients who are both sensitized and exposed to respiratory allergens. 17 These findings suggest that individuals with respiratory allergies or eosinophilic airway inflammation are at increased risk for wheezing with virus. This concept has been difficult to model using experimentally-induced colds, however, as allergen administration before inoculation did not enhance symptoms of the cold. 116, 117 Viral infections are postulated to interact with allergic inflammation leading to airway dysfunction through several mechanisms. For example, viral infections could damage the barrier function of the airway epithelium, leading to enhanced absorption of aeroallergens across the airway wall and enhanced inflammation. 118 Additionally, production of various cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6), chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CCL2, CXCL8), leukotrienes, and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1) may further up-regulate cellular recruitment, cell activation, and the ongoing inflammatory response. 119 ",

A recent meta-analysis of six trials involving 374 subjects assessed the benefit of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation. 135 A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an asthma exacerbation significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care, hospitalizations and use of short-acting \u03b2 2 agonist without an apparent increase in sideeffects. Intramuscular and oral corticosteroids are both effective. As a reflection of such information, the most recent National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma 136 recommends the addition of corticosteroids for asthma exacerbations unresponsive to bronchodilators. These guidelines suggest that the introduction of oral prednisone or prednisolone, for a short course may reduce the duration of the exacerbation and prevent hospitalization. However, only a few pediatric studies have examined whether systemic corticosteroids reduce the severity of exacerbations in children who have bronchospasm exclusively with viral infections. Brunette and colleagues 137 explored the role of early intervention with oral corticosteroid therapy in 32 children under the age of 6 years (mean age, 38.4 months) with asthma typically provoked by viral URI. During the first year of this 2-year study, acute exacerbations were treated with oral bronchodilators initially, with the addition of prednisone for more severe attacks. In the second year, oral prednisone was administered at the first sign of a URI to a group of patients whose parents and caretakers were unblinded to the treatment intervention. The group receiving prednisone during the second year experienced fewer attacks, a 65% reduction in the number of wheezing days, a 61% decrease in emergency department visits, and a 90% decrease in hospitalizations. The administration of prednisone at the first sign of URI that occur as a result of bronchiolitis has been controversial because of variations in study design, the inability to rapidly and conveniently measure pulmonary physiologic variables, the confounding of results by the inclusion of children with a history of multiple wheezing episodes (i.e. asthmatic phenotypes), and the choice of outcome measures that have been evaluated. In a Cochrane meta-analysis of this subject 126 bronchodilators were found to generate modest short-term improvements in clinical features of mild or moderately severe bronchiolitis; no differences in the rate or duration of hospitalization were noted. However, given the high costs and uncertain benefit of this therapy, the authors concluded that bronchodilators could not be recommended for routine management of first-time wheezers. Similarly, the recent American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) bronchiolitis guidelines suggest that many children with bronchiolitis do not show a response to bronchodilators. However, a carefully monitored trial of \u03b2-adrenergic medication is an option and inhaled bronchodilators could be continued if there is a documented positive clinical response to the trial using an objective means of evaluation. 127 The efficacy of therapy with either oral or parenteral corticosteroids was reviewed in a meta-analysis of studies that sought to evaluate this form of intervention. 128 A meta-analysis of 13 studies involving therapy with either oral or parenteral corticosteroids concluded that this approach demonstrated a pooled decrease in length of stay of 0.38 days. However, this decrease was not statistically significant. The review concluded: 'No benefits were found in either LOS [length of stay] or clinical score in infants and young children treated with systemic glucocorticoids as compared with placebo'. Two additional studies that evaluated inhaled corticosteroids in bronchiolitis 129, 130 showed no benefit in the course of the acute disease. Thus, the AAP bronchiolitis guidelines recommend that corticosteroid medications should not be used routinely in the management of bronchiolitis as the safety of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids in infants is still not clear and an apparent benefit has not been demonstrated. 127 For the majority of cases, supportive treatment remains the standard of care for infants with bronchiolitis.",

Connett and Lenney 143 compared the efficacy of two doses of budesonide (800 or 1600 mg twice daily) via MDI and a spacer device initiated at the onset of upper respiratory tract symptoms in preschool-aged children with recurrent wheezing with URIs. Therapy was continued for up to 7 days or until patients were asymptomatic for 24 hours. Budesonide therapy was associated with decreased symptom scores during the first week of infection. A doubleblind, placebo-controlled crossover study by Svedmyr and colleagues 144 involved the administration of budesonide (200 mg 4 times daily for 3 days, 3 times daily for 3 days, and then twice daily for 3 days) via MDI and spacer or placebo to children 3 to 10 years of age with a history of URI-associated deterioration of asthma. Although budesonide therapy had no significant impact on symptom scores, it was associated with significantly higher peak expiratory flow rates. In an emergency department-based study, Volovitz and colleagues 145 compared the effects of inhaled budesonide and oral prednisolone in children aged 6 to 16 years with acute asthma exacerbations. Patients received either budesonide 1600 mg by Turbuhaler or 2 mg/kg of oral prednisolone in the emergency department followed by a tapering dose of medication over the next 6 days. Both treatment groups had similar rates of improvement in the emergency department in terms of symptom scores and peak expiratory flow. However, over the next week, the budesonide-treated group had a more rapid improvement in asthma symptoms. Serum cortisol levels and response to corticotropin were significantly decreased in the prednisolone-treated group at the end of the week of therapy compared with the budesonide-treated group but returned to the normal range 2 weeks later. This study suggests that high-dose therapy with a potent ICS may be as effective as oral prednisolone and avoids hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Another study comparing the effects of high-dose ICSs and oral corticosteroids in children seen in an emergency department for severe, acute asthma (mean FEV 1 , <40% predicted on presentation) found oral corticosteroids to be superior in terms of improvement in lung function and hospitalization rate. 146 However, these patients were clearly in the middle of severe exacerbations, and ICSs were not used early in the course of the illness. Another recent study of 129 nonatopic preschool children with moderate-to-severe virus-induced wheezing demonstrated a 50% reduction in use of rescue oral corticosteroids during wheezing episodes when high-dose fluticasone was used intermittently at the onset of illness compared to placebo. 147 This suggests a potential benefit of inhaled corticosteroid use in nonatopic children with recurrent wheeze; however, the authors recommended further studies to be done before this treatment strategy was adopted as a small, but statistically significant decrease in height growth was observed.",

Daugbjerg and colleagues 142 conducted a double-blind, placebocontrolled trial comparing the effects of inhaled bronchodilator alone or in combination with either high-dose ICS (budesonide nebulization 0.5 mg every 4 hours until discharge) or systemic corticosteroid (prednisolone) in children younger than 18 months who were admitted to a hospital with acute wheezing. Their results demonstrated earlier discharge from the hospital in both the inhalation and systemic corticosteroid-treated groups, as well as a significantly accelerated rate of clinical improvement in the budesonide-treated group compared with the oral cortico-tory tract infection or asthma symptoms for a minimum of 7 days.

In younger children (2 to 8 years of age) with mild asthma or recurrent wheezing, only one comparison trial of continuous treatment has been published. 155 In this study, the effects of ICS (once-daily budesonide inhalation suspension 0.5 mg) were compared to LTRA (once-daily oral montelukast 4 or 5 mg). No significant between-group differences were observed for the primary outcome (time to first additional asthma medication at 52 weeks); however, other secondary outcomes such as time to first additional asthma medication was longer and exacerbation rates were lower over a period of 52 weeks for budesonide versus montelukast. Time to first severe exacerbation (requiring oral corticosteroids) was similar in both groups. This study had some significant limitations, as \u2248 30% of children did not complete the study and one third of children had adherence rates less than 80%. In addition, a significant portion of children were \u2265 5 years of age and analyses were not stratified by age, making it difficult to extrapolate conclusions to the toddler wheezing age group. Finally, the study was not stratified by atopic status. A recent trial, Acute Intervention Management Strategies (AIMS), examined the effectiveness of episodic use of a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, or placebo during respiratory tract illnesses in 238 preschool children with moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing. Intermittent budesonide and montelukast modestly improved symptom scores during respiratory tract illnesses but did not improve episodefree days (EFDs) or decrease oral corticosteroid use.

            "text": "Influenza vaccine is used as a prevention strategy to reduce virus-induced exacerbations of asthma in the winter. For RSV and HRV, which are more frequently associated with wheezing illnesses, vaccines are not available, and considering that there are well over 100 strains of HRV 35 standard vaccination techniques are not technically feasible for this virus. Although limited by high cost to treatment of high-risk groups, passive prophylaxis with neutralizing antibody to RSV can reduce the influence of more severe respiratory disease. It is encouraging that a small case-control study of premature infants treated with RSV immune globulin reported better lung function and less atopy and asthma in the treated group 7 to 10 years later. 157 In addition, in a European case-control study, infants treated with palivizumab had lower rates of recurrent wheezing compared with untreated controls. 158 Although interpretation of these studies is limited by the lack of randomization, the findings provide reason for optimism and additional preventive studies. Several antiviral agents are in development, and a number of anti-HRV compounds have been are detectable in the blood, urine, nasal secretions, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with chronic asthma. In addition, leukotrienes are released during acute asthma episodes. Volovitz and colleagues 148 demonstrated elevated levels of leukotriene C 4 (LTC 4 ) in nasopharyngeal secretions from infants with acute bronchiolitis because of RSV compared with children with upper respiratory illnesses alone. In another study, van Schaik and colleagues 149 also examined leukotriene levels in nasopharyngeal samples from infants and young children with URIs without wheezing, bronchiolitis (first-time wheezers), or acute episodes of wheezing in children with prior wheezing episodes. These investigators found elevated levels of leukotrienes in nasopharyngeal samples from both first-time and recurrent viral wheezers compared with children with nonwheezing URIs. Finally, bronchoalveolar lavage samples obtained from young children (median age, 14.9 months) with recurrent wheezing contain increased numbers of epithelial and inflammatory cells, and also increased levels of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathway mediators. 150 Interestingly, the levels of these cells and mediators were unaffected by concurrent treatment with ICSs. Studies in vitro or in animal models also suggested that leukotrienes contribute to virus-induced wheezing and asthma. For example, RSV induces 5-lipoxygenase activity in bronchial epithelial cell lines, 151 and in a rat model, treatment with a leukotriene antagonist reduces RSV-induced airway edema in rats. 152 The effect of a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in modulating virus-induced wheezing has been evaluated in clinical studies. Initially, a pilot study demonstrated a 28-day treatment course of montelukast significantly reduced lower respiratory tract symptoms in infants who were hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis. 153 However, a larger double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 979 children, aged 3 to 24 months, who had been hospitalized for a first or second episode of physician-diagnosed RSV bronchiolitis, were randomized to placebo or to montelukast at 4 or 8 mg/day for 4 weeks and 20 weeks. In this more definitive study, no significant differences were seen between montelukast and placebo groups in the percentage of symptomfree days over either treatment period. This study suggests that this class of compounds are not useful in the prevention of postbronchiolitis respiratory symptoms. Many other mediators and cytokines have been found to be augmented during viral infection. Future studies will determine whether inhibition of specific components of virus-induced inflammation, such as proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-8) or mediators (leukotrienes, bradykinin), will be able to provide safe and effective relief from virus-induced wheezing and asthma.",

Once these mechanisms are established, it may be possible to identify with greater certainty children who are at the greatest risk for wheezing with viral infections, or those children whose virus-induced wheezing is a preface to asthma. This would represent an important step forward in that preventive therapy could be focused to the groups with the greatest need. Of course, the other rationale for identifying pathogenic mechanisms of virus-induced wheeze is to identify targets for novel therapeutic strategies. Standard therapy for asthma is not satisfactory in that efficacy is low during respiratory infections, and in the case of systemic corticosteroids, side-effects can be significant. Given the close relationship between viral infections and wheezing illnesses in children, it would be attractive to apply antiviral strategies to the prevention and treatment of asthma, and both HRV and RSV are obvious targets. Unfortunately, attempts at developing an RSV vaccine have so far been unsuccessful, and vaccination to prevent HRV infection does not seem to be feasible because of the large number of serotypes. As an alternative, several types of antiviral agents are in development, and several compounds with activity against HRV have been tested in clinical trials.",

First, they may be involved in the inception of the asthmatic phenotype within the first decade of life. Second, once asthma is clinically recognized, viral infections may cause disease exacerbations in patients with both intermittent and persistent phenotypes. Third, if asthma goes into remission, it is possible that certain infections may contribute to disease relapse. Fourth, infections may contribute to disease chronicity and/or severity over time. Fifth, infections (based on their type, frequency, target organ involvement, and/or timing) may actually prevent the development of allergic sensitization and perhaps asthma as well. Finally, allergic sensitization and allergen exposures may act as important cofactors in the clinical expression of the asthmatic response to various infections.",

Virus-induced cytokines, together with unique viral products such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), are potent inducers of antiviral responses.
