The tMRCA of SARS-CoV-2 strains in China could be traced back to December 9, 2019. According to the effective population size curve reconstructed by Skyline model, this research revealed the influence of travel ban measures on the effective population size in China. Furthermore, we divided the epidemic process of SARS-CoV-2 in China into 4 stages according to the effective population size curve. With the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection method, phylogeographical reconstruction detailedly described the geographic spread behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in each stage and confirmed the importance of travel ban in blocking SARS-CoV-2 cross-regional spread. This article summarizes the influence of prevention and control measures in China, which has a positive impact on the world.",

The trend line of clinical published data illustrated that the growth period of new daily confirmed began on January 19, 2020. The data of Hubei Province dominated China's and gradually increased until Feb 6, 2020. In other regions of China expect Hubei, the declined inflection point appeared on January 1, 2020. The Ne curve ascended rapidly from December 25, 2019 to the inflection point on January 25, 2020, and then declined until February 6, 2020. Compared with clinical published data, the Ne curve estimated by the Skyline model probably provided more information. We found that the Ne of viral strain in China had expanded before Jan 2020. The inflection point of Ne curve emerged on the third day after travel ban policy implemented (25 Jan 2020), which indicated that China's control measures had curbed the growth trend expeditiously and effectively. Besides, the rapid decline of viral Ne between Jan 25 to February 6, 2020 indicated that the epidemic in China was controlled in a short time, however, the trend was not judged by clinical published data until the mid of Feb 2020.",

In stage , form January 25 to February 6, 2020, with the implementation of Level -I alert and travel ban in almost regions of China, the viral Ne decreased to a stable situation in about 10 days. In stage , the viral Ne kept at a low-level state after February 6, 2020, meanwhile, the decline of new daily confirmed number in China was also observed. The phylogeographic reconstruction MCC tree was displayed by FigTree package (Fig. 2), after an initial spread in Hubei Province, 2 lineages emerged on December 23, 2019 simultaneously, and the ancestors of those 2 lineages were traced in Hubei strains. Lineage A covered 160 strains and distributed in 12 regions of China. Lineage B contained 51 strains distributed in 4 regions of China. We identified 4 phylogenetic clusters as posterior probabilities over 0.85 in those two lineages, one of them was identified in lineage A distributed in Shanghai, and the others originated from lineage B. We noticed that cluster d contained 5 strains in Hong Kong, Beijing and Sichuan were traced in stage .
