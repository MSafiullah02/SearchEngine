I have treated with LPV/r as an antiviral agent in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19, but the disease course has not improved dramatically.4 Fortunately, the patient did not develop acute respiratory failure, but it was not clear whether it was an effect of antiviral drug.",

In this case report, it is difficult to determine that the test result is positive because the Ct value is 35.66 on day 10, the day of the antiviral treatment. If there was a virus, it would have remained a very low titer. Since LPV/r was administered during the virus titer reduction from 30.71 (day 9) to 35.66 (day 10), I think two consecutive negative results are more likely to be due to the natural history of the disease than to antiviral agents. Furthermore, the authors did not explain why Ct values are consistently detected near positive criteria from day 4 of treatment despite the continued use of antiviral agents.",

However, the authors are making a leap of logic that LPV/r administration reduces viral load. Also, the authors explain that LPV/r administration has also improved clinical symptoms. However, The fever has already been falling from the day before, and the cough lasted for few more days. Since LPV/r was given to patients on day 10, it could not be regarded as being administered in the early stages of the disease. However, the authors argue that antivirals should be given early in the disease, based on this case. For the reasons described so far, it is difficult to say that LPV/r lowers the virus level or improves symptoms or is \"recommended\" for COVID-19 treatment based on this case report alone.",
