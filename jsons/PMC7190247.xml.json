            "text": "The use of lights and sirens is well established in the emergency medical services (EMS) community. However, there are risks associated with their use. Thousands of emergency vehicle accidents occur each year because of lights and sirens usage.1\u20134 Ambulance use of lights and sirens is associated with increased risk of ambulance crashes, resulting in more severe injuries and more fatalities.2,3 Restraints provide a significant form of protection for ambulance occupants involved in an accident. However, rear compartment passengers are at the greatest risk of death or serious injury when an ambulance is involved in a crash while utilizing lights and sirens.4 Although this risk has been well communicated, practice within the EMS community remains variable. An analysis utilizing the 2016 National Emergency Medical Services Information System database found that the average use of lights and sirens was 77% in the response phase (to the patient) and average usage of 23% in the transport phase (to the receiving facility).2 Another study utilizing the 2010 National Emergency Medical Services Information System data only looked at the use of lights and sirens in the response phase to the patient, not the transport phase to the receiving hospital. This earlier dataset showed that the average use of lights and sirens in the response phase was 75.8%.5",
