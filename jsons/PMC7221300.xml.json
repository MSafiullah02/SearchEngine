Other than health care workers, anyone who are physically present or associated with health care institutions were at high risk of infection by SARS\u2010CoV. Worldwide, HCWs comprised a significant 21% of all SARS patients, but in countries such as Canada and Singapore, more than 40% of the patients were HCWs.\n10\n Performance of certain procedures, such as intubation and nebulization of SARS patients was recognized as having a significant risk of infection. However, even low\u2010exposure situations and transient exposures to infected cases posed infection risks. There were also reports of \u201csuper\u2010spreaders,\u201d who often were initially undiagnosed, and who spread the disease to clusters of HCWs.",

The patient presented with abdominal symptoms and was initially admitted to a surgery department, resulting in over 10 HCWs being infected.\n12\n In many other countries, currently thousands of HCWs have been infected, and hundreds have died, though not all have occurred because of occupational exposure.

The number of HCWs as a proportion of all cases of COVID\u201019 appears to be smaller and HCWs comprise less than 20% of cases. Several factors may have contributed to this. For example, in Singapore, there are established occupational medicine departments to protect HCWs in major Singapore government hospitals in 2020. In comparison, no such departments existed in 2003. To reduce the risk of occupational exposure to infection, personal protective equipment (PPE) have been stockpiled, HCWs are mask fitted, repeated training in infection control techniques have been given, and strict adherence to infection control protocols is mandated.

The latest guidelines from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in April 2020\n27\n recommend that masks or face coverings should be worn by the public when they go out.
