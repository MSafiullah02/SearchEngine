            "text": "The treatment of infectious diseases still remain a challenging task because of combination of factors such as an alarming increase in number of multi-drug-resistant microbial pathogens and advent of newer infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza. Despite the availability of a large number of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, the increasing clinical importance of drug-resistant microbial pathogens have lent additional urgency in microbiological and antifungal research [1], [2], [3], [4]. A potential solution to the antibiotic resistance is to design and explore innovative heterocyclic agents with novel mode of actions. In this context, thiazole derivatives have been playing a crucial role in medicinal chemistry. Thiazole nucleus constitutes an integral part of all the available penicillins, which have transformed the bacterial diseases therapy [5]. They display quite a broad spectrum of biological activities [6], which have found applications in the treatment of allergies [7], hypertension [8], inflammation [9], schizophrenia [10], microbial infections [11], [12], HIV infections [13], hypnotics [14] and pain [15]. They are also used as new inhibitors of bacterial DNA gyrase B [16]. Further, thiazoles have emerged as new class of potent antimicrobial agents, which are reported to inhibit bacteria by blocking the biosynthesis of certain bacterial lipids and/or by additional mechanisms [17], [18].",

Potent pharmacological activity of 1,3,4-oxadiazoles can be attributed to the presence of toxophoric \u2013N\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nC\u2013O\u2013 linkage which may react with the nucleophilic centers of the microbial cell [20]. Further, the widespread use of 1,3,4-oxadiazoles as a scaffold in medicinal chemistry established this moiety as a member of the privileged structures class and its derivatives have exhibited a wide range of biological activities such as antibacterial [21], antitubercular [22], vasodialatory [23], antifungal [24], cytotoxic [25], anti-inflammatory and analgesic [26], [27], hypolipidemic [28], anticancer [29] and ulcerogenic [30]. Oxadiazole derivatives have been found to possess broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and therefore are useful substructures for further molecular exploration [30]. The most prominent examples of prescribed agents featuring the 1,3,4-oxadiazoles nucleus include the antiretroviral raltegravir [31], antihypertensive nesapidil [32] and the antibiotic furamizole [33] (Fig. 1\n).",

The intermediate obtained thus, was refluxed with carbon disulfide in the presence of potassium hydroxide in ethanol (99.5%) to yield intermediate N-(4-methyl-5-(5-thioxo-4,5-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)thiazol-2-yl)acetamide (4). Mannich condensation of intermediate 4 with 36% formaldehyde and an appropriately substituted aniline derivative in ethanol (99.5%) furnished the desired compounds 5a\u2013l.

            "text": "All the synthesized compounds 5a\u2013l were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Streptococcus pyogenes MTCC 442 (Gram-positive), Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 1688 (Gram-negative) by conventional broth microdilution method using chloramphenicol as a control drug for antibacterial activity [40]. The results of the antimicrobial studies are presented in Table 1\n. In general, compounds 5a\u2013l demonstrated better antibacterial activity than antifungal activity. Compounds 5c and 5i emerged as the most effective antibacterial agents with 2- to 4-fold higher MIC (12.5\u201325 \u03bcg/mL) than the reference drug chloramphenicol. While, compounds 5b and 5h exhibited comparable antibacterial activity with the standard drug. From the results of the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds 5a\u2013l, the following structure activity relationships can be derived: the antibacterial activity was considerably affected by substitution pattern on the phenyl ring and the most active compounds contain electron withdrawing substituent at para and meta positions of the phenyl ring (p > m > o). In contrast, the presence of electron releasing groups on the phenyl ring witnessed a substantial decrease in antibacterial activity for compounds 5d\u2013f and 5k\u2013l. The role of electron withdrawing group in improving antimicrobial activity is very well supported by previous studies [41], [42]. Compounds 5c and 5i, substituted with inductively electron withdrawing fluoro and nitro groups, respectively at para position showed the highest antibacterial activity (F > NO2). It is a very well-known fact that electron withdrawing substitution such as fluoro/nitro at the para position of the aromatic ring increases the lipophilicity of molecules. This property is directly related to antimicrobial activity as it facilitates a compound to diffuse through the biological membranes and reach to its site of action. The presence of lipophilic substituent at para position of phenyl ring provided a positive influence on antibacterial activity. On the other hand, presence of the same functional groups at meta position resulted in slight decrease in the antibacterial activity (5b and 5h) but, still produced significant inhibitory action compared to the standard drug chloramphenicol (F > NO2). While, substituting the phenyl ring with fluoro and nitro group at ortho position resulted in noticeable decrease in the antibacterial activity of compounds 5a and 5g respectively. On the basis of MIC values, it may be concluded that electron withdrawing atom/group such as fluoro and nitro at the para position of phenyl ring induced a positive effect while electron donating groups such as methyl and methoxy induced a negative effect on antibacterial activity of compounds 5a\u2013l.",

The enhanced activity of compound 5f may be attributed to the presence of electron releasing group at para position. The contrasting nature of substitution pattern at para position of the phenyl ring of most active antibacterial and antifungal agents indicate that the structural requirements are different for binding of drug to bacterial or fungal targets, respectively [43].

The potent antimicrobial activity of most active compounds 5b, 5c, 5f, 5h and 5i were accompanied with relatively low level of cytotoxicity.

DMSO was used as diluents to get desired concentration of compounds to test upon standard bacterial strains. Serial dilutions were prepared in primary and secondary screening. The control tube containing no antibiotic was immediately subcultured (before inoculation) by spreading a loopful evenly over a quarter of plate of medium suitable for the growth of the test organism and put for incubation at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The tubes were then incubated overnight. The MIC of the control organism was read to check the accuracy of the compound concentrations. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the antibiotic or test sample allowing no visible growth. All the tubes showing no visible growth (same as control tube) were subcultured and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The amount of growth from the control tube before incubation (which represents the original inoculum) was compared. Subcultures might show: similar number of colonies indicating bacteriostatic; a reduced number of colonies indicating a partial or slow bactericidal activity and no growth if the whole inoculum has been killed. The test must include a second set of the same dilutions inoculated with an organism of known sensitivity. Each synthesized compound was diluted obtaining 2000 \u03bcg/mL concentration as a stock solution. In primary screening 500, 250 and 200 \u03bcg/mL concentrations of the synthesized compounds were taken. The active synthesized compounds found in this primary screening were further tested in a second set of dilution against all microorganisms. The compounds found active in primary screening were similarly diluted to obtain 100, 62.5, 50 and 25 \u03bcg/mL concentrations. The highest dilution showing at least 99% inhibition is taken as MIC.",

After 24 h, the medium was removed and cell cultures were incubated with 100 \u03bcl MTT reagent (1 mg/mL) for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C. The suspension was placed on micro vibrator for 10 min and absorbance was recorded by the ELISA reader. The experiment was performed in triplicate. Human cancer cell lines, HeLa cells were cultured in MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine and 50 \u03bcM/mL gentamicin sulphate in a CO2 incubator in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.",
