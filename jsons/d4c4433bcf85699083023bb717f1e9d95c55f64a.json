            "text": "COVID-19 first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December 2019 and spread rapidly in China. Currently, the spread of local epidemics has been basically blocked. The import of overseas epidemics has become the main form of growth in China 's new epidemic. As an important international transportation hub in China, Shanghai is one of the regions with the highest risk of imported cases abroad. Due to imported of overseas cases are affected by the international epidemic trend. The traditional infectious disease model is difficult to accurately predict the cumulative trend of cumulative cases in the Shanghai areas. It is also difficult to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the international traffic blockade. In this situation, this study takes Shanghai as an example to propose a new type of infectious disease prediction model. The model first uses the sparse graph model to analyze the international epidemic spread network to find countries and regions related to Shanghai. Next, multiple regression models were used to fit the existing COV-19 growth data in Shanghai. Finally, the model can predict the growth curve of Shanghai's epidemic without blocking traffic. The results show that the control measures taken by Shanghai are very effective. At present, more and more countries and regions will face the current situation in Shanghai. We recommend that other countries and regions learn from Shanghai 's successful experience in preventing overseas imports in order to fully prepare for epidemic prevention and control.",

Unless substantive public health interventions are implemented, overseas countries and regions that have close communications with China may cause the epidemic in China to escalate again. Among them, Shanghai, as one of China's largest international airports, is the region with the highest risk of overseas imports. Overseas case importation poses a huge threat to this city with a population of 24 million. As of 24:00 on April 2, 2020, there were 1562 confirmed cases in China, including 698 confirmed cases imported from abroad. The number of confirmed cases in Shanghai is 177, including 171 imported cases abroad. Therefore, in order to solve this problem. The Shanghai government has taken a lot of measures, including isolation observation, traffic control, and nucleic acid detection, etc. It is worth noting that from March 28th, Shanghai suspended the entry permit for non-Chinese nationals.",

Since the outbreak of Wuhan, several modeling research teams around the world have used an infection model based on the SIR or SEIR framework to estimate and predict COVID-19 [6] [7] [8] .However, the existing models are difficult to be directly applied to the prediction of overseas case trends. In this article, we propose a sparse relationship graph model for the establishment of an international epidemic spread network. After combining the regression model, we can predict the growth trend of cases in the target area. Because Shanghai, China is one of the earliest areas to take measures to block overseas spread. Therefore, this article takes Shanghai as an example, on the one hand, we want to verify the model proposed in this paper. On the other hand, we want to analyze whether the epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai are effective and whether Shanghai's measures can provide an effective reference for similar regions.",

For this study, our main focus is on nodes related to Shanghai, In the relationship network, if the model thinks that a country or region is related to Shanghai, it means that the epidemic situation in that country can affect the growth of cases in Shanghai.
