The TUNEL assay was also used to monitor the onset of apoptosis when using different m.o.i. (5, 0.5 and 0.05). A correlation was observed between the m.o.i. and the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting a direct relationship between viral infection and apoptosis.

In mock-infected cell lysates, anti-caspase 8 antibody recognized a protein of 55 kDa corresponding to the procaspase form. In addition, a polypeptide of approximately 26 kDa, which corresponds to the prodomain of caspase 8, was also detected in infected cells from 48 h p.i. (Fig. 5A)\n.

The blocking effects of Z-IETD-FMK were dose-dependent (reduction of apoptosis of 7.3% at 10 \u03bcM, 23.8% at 100 \u03bcM and 39.1% at 150 \u03bcM), while Z-LEHD-FMK could inhibit apoptosis only at the highest concentration (reduction of apoptosis of 42.2%). It should be pointed out, however, that the specificity of this compounds when they are used at high concentrations is not always guaranteed (Thornberry et al., 1997). Caspases belonging to Group III (6, 8 and 9) tolerate many different amino acids in P4 position but prefer those with larger aliphatic side chains. Their optimal peptide recognition motif is (X)E(H/T)D, being all of them quite tolerant to substitutions in P2. The only exception is caspase 9, which has a stringent specificity for H in P2 position. Thus, at 150 \u03bcM, the blocking effects of Z-LEHD-FMK may be due to a non-specific inhibition of caspase 8, whereas at low concentrations, only the optimal recognition motif may be able to inhibit caspase activation. Consistently, at 10 and 100 \u03bcM, only inhibition of caspase 8 had effective effects in reducing the percentage of apoptotic cells after infection, suggesting a relationship between astrovirus infection and caspase 8 activation.",

The effects of apoptosis on the replication of astrovirus were assayed by comparing virus production in the presence and absence of 100 \u03bcM Z-IETD-FMK and Z-LEHD-FMK at 48 h p.i. Viruses in the supernatant of infected cells were titrated using different approaches. Quantification of astrovirus progeny virions by both EIA and RT-PCR gave identical results in the absence or presence of any caspase inhibitors (Table 1)\n. Infectious titers, obtained by an integrated cell culture RT-PCR procedure (Abad et al., 2001), were consistently higher than those measured by direct end-point RT-PCR titration. This is a consequence of the lower sensitivity of the end-point RT-PCR detection technique in comparison with the infectivity assay where an in vivo amplification in cell culture provides higher sensitivity. Surprisingly, inhibition of caspase 8 activity caused a 1-log-reduction in the infectious progeny. These results suggest a role of caspase 8-derived apoptosis in the astrovirus capsid maturation process that lead to infectious virion capsids.",

They are known as the death domain superfamily, which includes death domains (DD), death effector domains (DED) and caspase recruitment domains (CARD). Each of the proteins belonging to this family interacts with other proteins through homotypic interactions and they are responsible for most of the specific recruitment events that take place during the apoptotic pathway. These domains possess remarkably similar structures consisting of six antiparallel \u03b1-helices with primarily hydrophobic core residues. The degree of similarity across the death domain superfamily can be rather low when measured by the amino acid sequence alignment alone without taking into consideration the structural information (Weber and Vincenz, 2001).",

As a result of the proteolytical processing of ORF1a polyprotein suggested by Kiang and Matsui (2002), this region would be included in the putative nonstructural protein of unknown function p38. The average percentage of amino acid identity and similarity between this region and several members of the death domain superfamily were 19.1% and 41.7%, respectively. In addition, using the 3D-SSPM web server in search of 3D structural homologies, this region showed structural homology to the death domain found in human Fas (hFasDD). An alignment of all the available astrovirus sequences from this region and hFasDD is shown in Fig. 7\n. The presence of a death domain in a nonstructural protein of ORF1a suggests a direct link between this protein and the apoptotic pathway.",

Upon electroporation of CaCo-2 cells, protein-expressing cells were labeled by immunofluorescence using antibodies against a synthetic peptide belonging to ORF1a and 8E7 monoclonal antibody for ORF2, while apoptotic nuclei were labeled by the TUNEL assay. Images of typical protein expressing cells are shown in Fig. 8\n. The percentage of protein-expressing cells that exhibited signs of apoptosis was calculated. The number of transfected cells that expressed viral proteins in each experiment was low, reflecting the previously reported inefficiency of CaCo-2 cells transfection (Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 1997). However, a significantly higher number of apoptotic cells was observed after transfection of the ORF1a construct (27.3% \u00b1 12.7%) than after transfection of the ORF2 construct (2.15% \u00b1 2.15%), confirming the presence of a proapoptotic protein in ORF1a. Additionally, although an increase of the protein expression was observed with either construct up to 5 days p.i., a proportional increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was only detected in the ORF1a-expressing cells.",

Caspases play a key role in the effector phase during apoptotic cell death and, while caspase 8 is an indicator of activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, caspase 9 is an indicator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Notwithstanding, recent experiments have demonstrated that the hierarchy of caspase activation is not always maintained to promote the amplification of weaker apoptotic signals Denecker et al., 2001, Kidd et al., 2000. It is now clear that in some types of cells, during the execution of the apoptotic extrinsic pathway, the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is not efficient enough to activate downstream effector caspases and therefore it requires amplification of the apoptotic signal by mitochondrial-mediated events. Caspase 8-mediated cleavage of a protein called Bid, which is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, directs its translocation to the mitochondria, where it induces release of cytochrome c\n(Luo et al., 1998). Like in the cases of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Eleouet et al., 2000), Sendai virus (Bitzer et al., 2002), parvovirus B19 (Sol et al., 1999) or Langat flavivirus (Prikhod'ko et al., 2002), our results, both by Western blot and specific inhibition experiments, suggest that caspase 8 pathway is involved in the apoptotic response during astrovirus infection.",

For other RNA virus such as Sindbis virus (Jan and Griffin, 1999) or reovirus (Connolly and Dermody, 2002), induction of apoptosis does not require virus replication. After transient expression experiments, our observations suggest that an apoptosis inducer may be encoded in ORF1a of astrovirus. Little is known about the biological function of the nonstructural proteins of astrovirus ORF1a, except that they contain a 3C-like serine protease motif (Matsui and Greenberg, 2001). In addition, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) has also been detected (Jiang et al., 1993) and astrovirus nonstructural proteins have been found in the nuclei of infected cells (Willcocks et al., 1999). The biological significance of this nuclear involvement in astrovirus life cycle is not fully understood. ORF1a and ORF1b are encoded in two separate reading frames, but are believed to be translated as a polyprotein. None of the proteolytic cleavage sites that are present within ORF1a have been fully characterized by N-terminal sequencing of the processed products. Between the protease motif and the nuclear localization signal, two different cleavage sites have been proposed using different approaches Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 2002a, Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 2002b, Kiang and Matsui, 2002. By computer analysis, we have identified a potential death domain motif within the nonstructural protein p38 of astrovirus, based on the proteolytic model proposed by Kiang and Matsui (2002). The prediction of coiled-coils regions close to the C terminus of ORF1a have also been recently reported in both human and animal astrovirus by Jonassen et al. (2003). Death domains are one form of the prototypical protein-interacting domains that play important roles in many of the protein\u2013protein interactions that take place both during the initial and the effector phases of apoptosis. A great degree of amino acid conservation is observed among the human astrovirus serotypes which have been sequenced at this region. The presence of a death domain would bring useful information on the role of this nonstructural protein. Further characterization of the p38 nonstructural protein in virus-infected cells and mutagenesis studies of its proapoptotic domain are under way.",

Only when using a high m.o.i. and long times p.i., around 70% of cells underwent apoptosis. Several reasons could explain why not all astrovirus-infected cells undergo apoptosis. One possibility could result from a technical problem, causing that the apoptotic stage of some infected cells would not be detectable by the TUNEL method. Another explanation could be that at a given time p.i., due to different stages of the virus replication cycle, the amount of apoptosis-inducing viral protein produced within some cells would be still too low to induce apoptosis. Even a viral apoptotic inhibitor could also be encoded in a different part of the genome. An intricate balance between both viral and cellular proapoptotic and antiapoptotic stimuli within the cell may decide whether it will die by apoptosis or not. In cell differentiating types such as CaCo-2 cells, this balance may be even more variable depending on the stage of differentiation.",

            "text": "Interestingly, in the presence of a caspase 8 specific inhibitor, there was a significant reduction in the infectivity of the virus progeny, while the titer of physical virions (estimated by EIA and RT-PCR) was not affected. These data are different from those obtained for other viruses such as Sendai virus (Bitzer et al., 1999), transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Eleouet et al., 1999) or avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (Liu et al., 2001), whose virus production was not reduced when inhibiting the apoptotic process. From our results, we conclude that apoptotic death of host cells seems necessary for efficient astrovirus particle maturation. For some viruses, it has been observed that some of their proteins undergo caspase-mediated proteolysis within the host cell Al-Molawi et al., 2003, Eleouet et al., 2000, Zhirnov et al., 1999. The astrovirus capsid processing and assembly is still controversial. Recently, different models have been proposed by different authors using different human astrovirus serotypes Bass and Qiu, 2000, Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 2002a, Geigenm\u00fcller et al., 2002b, M\u00e9ndez et al., 2002, and the action of a cellular protease has been suggested. Sequence analysis of all the available human amino acid sequences of ORF2 reveals the presence of some putative caspase cleavage sites close to the C terminus of the polyprotein. The relationship between a potential role of caspase-dependent capsid maturation and the physiological significance of apoptosis induction by human astrovirus in intestinal cells is currently being investigated.",

First, the amount of astrovirus antigen in dilutions of the supernatant medium was measured by indirect enzyme immunoassay as described by Herrmann et al. (1990). Second, the titer of astrovirus genomes was measured by end-point dilution RT-PCR, using primers A1 and A2, as previously described Guix et al., 2002, Willcocks et al., 1994. Finally, infectious titer was measured by a previously described method (Abad et al., 2001). Briefly, samples were pretreated with trypsin and 10-fold dilutions were inoculated onto CaCo-2 cells monolayers grown in 24-well plates. Trypsin was added to the p.i. medium and the presence of virus in the supernatant of each dilution was evaluated by RT-PCR using primers A1 and A2, after 6 days of incubation.",
