These infections are ubiquitous and contagious, affecting repeatedly individuals of all ages, particularly children younger than 5 years of age [World Health Organization, 2009] and many infections have unknown etiologies. The recent discovery of the human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) in 2001 [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] and of the human Bocavirus (hBoV) in 2005 [Allander et al., 2005] identified the etiological causes of several respiratory infections. hMPV is a common cause of respiratory disease in children under 5 years old and often accounts for severe clinical manifestations, including bronchiolitis or pneumonia [Foulongne et al., 2006]. hMPV is a single\u2010stranded negative RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, Pneumovirinae subfamily [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Broor et al., 2008]. Molecular analysis identified two major genotypes (A and B) with genetic lineages A1, A2 and B1, B2, respectively [van den Hoogen et al., 2004]. Lineage A2 has been recently divided into A2a and A2b sublineages [Huck et al., 2006].",

Both hMPV and hBoV infections were associated with lower respiratory tract infections. hMPV was present as a single infectious agent in 7.2% of children aged \u226412 months with bronchiolitis. The involvement of hBoV at the onset of bronchiolitis was difficult to asses due to the frequent association with other viruses, particularly RSV.

The extended persistence of hBoV in airways (up to 7 months) increased patient's chances of acquiring a co\u2010infection, explaining the high frequency of co\u2010infections with this virus [Brieu et al., 2008; Lindner et al., 2008; von Linstow et al., 2008]. The seasonal distribution of hBoV, with a peak incidence between December and January, resembled that observed for RSV, hRV, and hAdV. This suggested that the overlapping distribution of these viruses during the seasons could have facilitated hBoV co\u2010infections. The epidemiologic model of hMPV infections was distinct from many other respiratory viruses, with peak incidence rates in late spring, mostly between March and April. This observation may account for the absence of hMPV\u2010hBoV co\u2010infections.",

Guant et al. [Gaunt et al., 2006] suggested a further potential back\u2010shift to genotype B in Scotland during the winter season of 2007/2008. Unfortunately, no samples from this study were available for sequencing to confirm this hypothesis. As suggested by Herbert et al. [2005], the complex circulation pattern of hMPV may be the reason this strain can escape pre\u2010existing host immune responses, suggesting that additional molecular surveillance studies need to be carried out to confirm genotype B back shift circulation and to clarify the existence of a seasonal distribution of hMPV strains. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that both hBoV genotypes co\u2010circulated during the study period and that genotype St2 predominated. Interestingly, evidence of genetic recombination between the two hBoV strains (with a breakpoint site in the VP1/VP2 region) was found. The two mosaic sequences (identity: 100%) were identified in two different years (2007 and 2008), indicating that this variant had been circulating in the population since at least 2007. Genetic recombination has been reported to occur in Parvoviruses [Shackelton et al., 2007; Ohshima and Mochizuki, 2009] and in different hBoV species [Arthur et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2009, 2010]. To date, only Lin et al. [2009] have reported an intra\u2010species recombination event involving hBoV1, with a breakpoint located in the NS1 gene. Taken together, these data suggested that intra\u2010species recombination could occur in hBoV1 at different positions of its genome, playing a major role in the evolutionary history of this virus. Further studies will be necessary to identify breakpoint patterns in these viruses and to identify their potential association with viral spread among populations.",

Data presented in this report provided evidence for both a shift in the incidence of hMPV A2 strain infections in recent years and the occurrence of recombination events in hBoV strains. Therefore, continuous molecular surveillance is important for the detection of new viral strains as a means of detecting their spread and assessing their epidemiological impact.",
