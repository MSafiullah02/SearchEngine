            "text": "Trauma is the leading cause of death in persons aged 1\u201344 years [1] and accounts for approximately 10% of all deaths in this group [2]. Despite substantial improvements in acute trauma care over the past decades, uncontrolled haemorrhage is still responsible for approximately 50% of all trauma-related deaths within the first 48 h after hospital admission [3, 4]. Meanwhile, a new appreciation of coagulopathy in acute trauma care has evolved and the acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) is now recognized as an own entity [5\u20137]. To date, six key initiators of ATC have been ascribed: tissue trauma, shock, haemodilution, hypothermia, acidemia, and inflammation [8]. Brohi et al. [9] emphasized the role of hypoperfusion and shock for the initiation of ATC. In adult trauma patients, frequencies for ATC upon emergency room (ER) admission have been reported to range between 20 and 60% according to definition [5, 10, 11]. However, data on the incidence for coagulopathy and shock in the paediatric population with predominantly blunt injury are rare. One large report including both shock and coagulopathy measures has been published for children with mostly penetrating injury [12]. Hendrickson and colleagues have evaluated coagulopathy in a single centre cohort of 102 children with > 80% blunt injuries on ER presentation and quantified the relationship with mortality [13]. We report on the frequency of coagulopathy upon ER admission in children (\u2264 17 years) with predominantly blunt injury, subsequent on transfusion practice in cases of severe trauma haemorrhage and on outcome based upon data derived from the trauma registry of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Unfallchirurgie (German Trauma Society/TR-DGU\u00ae).",

Detailed information on demographics, injury pattern, co-morbidities, pre-hospital and early in-hospital management, time course, relevant laboratory findings, and outcome of each individual are captured. Between 2009 and 2016, over 50,000 patients from more than 400 hospitals had been entered into the database. All injuries are coded using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) [15]. Scientific data analysis is approved according to a peer-review procedure laid down in the publication guideline of TR-DGU\u00ae.",

J. Quick in 1935 and is either expressed in Quick-% (70\u2013130% = normal) or as a prothrombin time ratio (PTr) [16]. Although the international normalized ratio (INR) was introduced as a coagulation test, most German physicians and medical institutions prefer the prothrombin time in Quick (%). Thus, the TR-DGU\u00ae documents prothrombin time in Quick-%. A Quick\u2019s value of < 70% is equivalent to an INR (international normalized ratio) of approximately 1.4. Coagulopathy was distinguished via laboratory findings: Quick\u2019s value < 70% (INR > 1.4) or PTT \u2265 40 or thrombocyte count of \u2264 100,000. Demographics, injury severity, haemostatic management including volume administration and transfusions and outcome were assessed in all groups.",

Furthermore, uncontrolled haemorrhage is considered to be responsible for approximately 50% of all trauma-related in-hospital deaths within the first 48 h of admission [3, 4], but heavily shifted towards the first 2 h [24, 25] emphasizing the importance of early recognition of coagulopathy and thus prompting early goal-directed therapy.",

This is a retrospective study with all the associated shortcomings, for example, the introduction of a selection bias. Furthermore, a significant number of children had to be excluded from the present analysis, either due to missing INR and Quick\u2019s value or secondary admission. Furthermore, hypothermia has been shown to be an important trigger of coagulopathy [8, 19, 25]. Unfortunately, body temperature is only poorly documented in the TR-DGU\u00ae and, therefore, the role of hypothermia could not be substantiated in the present analysis. Additionally, the vast majority of our patients suffered from blunt trauma, as penetrating trauma is rare (less than 10%) in German trauma populations. Further prospective trials are needed to gain knowledge on the physiology and pathophysiology of severe shock and coagulopathy in paediatric trauma patients. Additional studies are required to determine if damage control resuscitation strategies improve survival in paediatric populations.",
