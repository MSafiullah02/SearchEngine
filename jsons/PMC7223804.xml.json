Standardised evaluation is essential to monitor clinical improvement or deterioration and response to treatment. The widely used Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was originally introduced as a tool to assess levels of consciousness in patients with acute head trauma, but is now used in most patients with impaired consciousness [22]. However, the GCS has several limitations. Most importantly, its reliance on verbal output confounds the assessment of consciousness in patients with aphasia, the locked-in syndrome and those who are intubated [1, 24].",

This may occur because a GCS of 3 is frequently associated with iatrogenic causes such as sedation rather than the underlying neurological condition. Indeed, in our study a GCS score of 3 was the most common result (40% of assessments) and corresponded to a wide range of FOUR scores (from 0 to 6).

In contrast to most previous reports, we went further and frequently repeated assessments which allow us to conclude that more information can be obtained with repeated FOUR scores in patients with the lowest level of consciousness, as compared to the GCS. In other words, very low FOUR scores are more informative and carry a much more sinister prognosis than very low GCS scores.",

In this study, we showed that estimation of pupillary size and constriction by visual inspection can be very different from what is measured using automated pupillometry.",

Automated pupillometry is more precise and can reveal pupillary constriction below 0.1 mm (in contrast to visual inspection), although the additional prognostic value in this study appeared relatively limited [11]. Still, whenever visual evaluation suggests that pupils appear not to constrict to light, automated pupillometry should be used to corroborate this, which would help avoiding wrong conclusions, including those related to prognosis. At the same time, it is important to be aware that automated pupillometry can occasionally miss a pupillary light reflex in very sluggish pupils [9]. Compared to visual inspection, however, automated pupillometry does provide detailed quantitative information such as the speed of pupillary constriction, the percentage change of pupillary diameters and dilation velocity [7, 14, 16, 23]. The potential of these data as surrogate markers for the assessment of sedation, evolving brainstem damage, intracranial hypertension or consciousness levels should be investigated in future studies. Moreover, automated pupillometry might be valuable when it is mandatory to confirm the absence of pupillary function such as during brain death determination prior to organ donation.",

This corroborates earlier data showing that the FOUR score performs better than the GCS for the prognostication of ICU mortality, probably because the respiratory and brainstem reflex components of the FOUR score reflect morbidity better than does the verbal part of the GCS [25] and, as stated previously, because low GCS scores are frequently iatrogenic, e.g. due to sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents.
