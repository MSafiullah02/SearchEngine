Symptoms caused by these three viruses are 32 extremely similar, including acute diarrhea, vomiting and even death in piglets. To 33 date, strict biosecurity is still the most effective disease prevention and control 34 measures, and the early detection of pathogens is the most important link. Here, we 35 developed a microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system for the first time, which 36 could detected PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV simultaneously, and had advantages of 37 rapid, simple, sensitive, high-throughput, and accurate at point-of-care settings. The 38 lowest detection limits of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip method are 10 1 copies/\u03bcL, 39 10 2 copies/\u03bcL and 10 2 copies/\u03bcL for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV, respectively. The 40 whole detection procedure can be finished rapidly in 40 min without any 41 cross-reaction with other common swine viruses. A total of 173 clinical swine fecal 42 samples characterized with diarrheal symptoms were used to evaluate the 43 performance of the newly developed system, which presented good stabilities 44 3 (C.V.s<5%) and specificities (100%), and possessed sensitivities of 92.24%, 92.19% 45 and 91.23% for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV respectively. In summary, the 46 established microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system could satisfy the demanding 47 in field diagnoses, which was suitable for promotion in remote areas due to its fast, 48 portable and cost-effective characters. 49 50",

To date, four swine 59 enteric coronaviruses have been defined, including three Alphacoronaviruses widely applied for detecting and identifying pathogens [27] [28] [29] [30] . 89 Up to now, the predominant control measures of swine diarrhea disease are the 90 rapid and accurate diagnoses of pathogens at the early stage to prevent further 91 circulations in swine. Currently, the most commonly detection methods for swine 92 enteric coronaviruses such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), PCR and 93 IHC (immunohistochemistry), all depend on laboratory diagnosis and possessed the 94 advantages of high sensitivity and accuracy, and have been widely used [31] [32] [33] [34] . 95 However\uff0c most of these diagnostic assays are complex, time-consuming, and require a 96 large of reagents and well-equipped laboratories, which limit their application in 97 remote areas. Therefore, it is urgent to develop portable POC devices with characters 98 of simple, timely, multi-target and strong pertinence, so as to detect pathogens early, showed that the developed microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system was accurate, 111 sensitive, specific and reproducible for point-of-care diagnosis, which was advantaged 112 for the early diagnosis of diarrhea in swine farms, especially in remote areas, and 113 adopting effective measures to control the spread of the diseases. The microfluidic chip made of PMMA that was used in this study was a CD-shape 132 with a diameter of 80 mm and a thickness of 2.5 mm, which was fabricated by the 133 micro-injection molding technology. To form an integrated microfluidic chip, a kind 134 of pressure-sensitive film was applied to seal the micro-channel of chip via suitable 135 pressure. The microfluidic chip comprised four independent units, each of which was 136 consisted of a sample well, a vent and eight micro reaction wells ( Figure 1A ). The 137 ball valve played a significant role throughout the process ensuring that the reaction 138 mixture diffused into the adjacent pipe and the reaction wells were filled with liquid.",

The threshold for choosing 201 the Tt was based on the fluorescence value of the negative controls of each test. Three 202 clinical samples were also conducted to determine the stability and reproducibility of 203 the developed microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system. 204 205 2.6. Microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip and qRT-PCR for the detection of clinical samples 206 A total of 173 swine clinical fecal samples characterized with diarrheal symptoms 207 were collected and detected by the developed microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system. 208 Samples being amplified in 60 min and showing the typical amplification curves were 209 considered to be positive. At the same time, the diagnostic accuracy of the 210 microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system was compared with the qRT-PCR assays, and 211 was further evaluated by generating receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs, Screening primers for three emerging and re-emerging swine coronaviruses 216 Several sets of LAMP primers were designed and screened for PEDV, PDCoV and 217 SADS-CoV, and one for each pathogen was selected respectively to conduct the 218 following experiments. The in vitro transcribed RNA of each coronavirus was used as 219 template. 220 After the temperature reached to 63.5 \u2103 for LAMP reaction, the fluorescence 221 signals were recorded for each hole every minute. Obvious S-shaped amplification 222 curves were observed on the display if successful experiments were processed. As 223 shown in Figure 2 (A-C), PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV could be amplified by the 224 candidate primers, and the primer set 3 (PEDV), 3 (PDCoV) and 4 (SADS-CoV) were 225 selected, respectively.

            "text": "Evaluation of the detection performance of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip 230 system 231 3.2.1 Specificity and sensitivity 232 To assess the specificity of the screened LAMP primers, 11 relevant swine viral 233 nucleic acid including that of CSFV, PPV, JEV, PCV2, PRRSV, PRV, SIV, FMDV, 234 SVA, RV and TGEV were applied in this study. As shown in Figure 3 (A-C) only 235 PEDV-, SADS-CoV-and PDCoV-positive samples presented obvious amplification 236 curves, and 11 other pathogens and the control water displayed negative reactions, 237 which illustrated the high specificity of the established microfluidic-RT-LAMP assay. 238 Taken together, the fluorescence curves during the amplification demonstrated that the 239 system had no cross reaction with other common swine viruses and possessed a high 240 degree of specificity. 241 After evaluating the specificity of the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system, the serially diluted plasmids carrying the highly conserved genes of PEDV, 243 PDCoV and SADS-CoV respectively were initially utilized to investigate the lowest 244 detection limits of the established microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system for each virus. F showed that the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system enabled the 246 detection of PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV within 40 min and the detection limit for 247 each of the three viruses were maintained at 10 1 copies/\u03bcL, 10 2 copies/\u03bcL and 10 2 248 copies/\u03bcL, respectively. Those detection limits of this system were competitive for the 249 application to POC diagnostic device [39-41]. The sample-to-answer time on-chip for 250 diagnosis, including nucleic acid extraction, adding reaction solution, sealing and 251 reaction, was approximately 1.5 h. On the other hand, the total volume of sample and 252 reaction buffer used for one on-chip detection hole was roughly 25 \u03bcL. Undoubtedly, 253 the new method developed here was a cost-effective and time-saving way for PEDV, 254 PDCoV, and SADS-CoV diagnosis with POC platform when compared with existing 255 methods [39-41]. In addition, the semi-logarithmic regression analysis was performed 256 using the data from the sensitivity test results of standard samples (Figure 3G-I). 257 There was a significant linear relationship between the logarithm of the plasmid 258 concentration and the Tt value for PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV with the R 2 values 259 of 0.965, 0.9827 and 0.9572, respectively, which indicated the potential quantitative 260 detection capability of this established diagnosis platform. Effective development of 261 diagnostic platform such as microfluidic chip requires ultrahigh sensitivity and 262 specificity to enable real-time analysis needed for clinical detection [42]. Based on 263 above data, the established microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip detection system is 13 competitive and competent in POC diagnosis of PEDV, PDCoV and SADSalso an important indicator for a diagnostic method [43]. For this part, 270 the high, medium and low detectable concentration standard samples were used to 271 validate the reproducibility and stability of the established microfluidic-RT-LAMP 272 chip detection system. We calculated the C.V. through dividing the standard deviation 273 (SD) by the mean of different samples at the same concentration. The results of Figure 274 4 A-C demonstrated the stability of our method. For the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip 275 detection system, the C.V. values of the standard samples of PEDV, PDCoV and 276 SADS-CoV ranged from 2.52% to 3.43%, 1.78% to 2.29% and 2.59 % to 3.75% 277 respectively with small SDs (Figure 4 G-I). All the above C.V. values were less than 278 5%, indicating the good reproducibility of each established microfluidic-RT-LAMP 279 chip method. The results were further confirmed by the clinical PEDV-, PDCoV-and 280 SADS-CoV-infected fecal samples (Figure 4D-F), which showed ideal C.V. values of 281 3.71%, 2.43% and 1.69% for each coronavirus (Figure G-I). In summary, the 282 developed CD-like microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system for the point-of-care 283 diagnosis of multiple genes of PEDV, PDCoV and SADS-CoV is promising, and can 284 be applied to the real-time qualitatively monitoring of these three coronaviruses with 285 high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity.",

The 296 coincidence rates (the proportion of the number of samples with the same test results 297 in the total number of test samples) of the detection results between the qRT-PCR and 298 the microfluidic-RT-LAMP chip system were 97.69%, 97.11% and 97.11% for PEDV, 299 PDCoV and SADS-CoV, respectively (Table 2).
