Results The weighted proportion of vapers who used e-cigarettes every day or some days ranged from 2.86% to 6.42% for US states. Statistically significant associations were observed between the weighted proportion of vapers and number of COVID-19 infected cases as well as COVID-19 deaths in the US after adjusting for the weighted proportion of smokers and other significant covariates in the GEE models. With every one percent increase in weighted proportion of vapers in each state, the number of COVID-19 infected cases increase by 0.3139 (95% CI: 0.0554 -0.5723) and the number of COVID-19 deaths increase by 0.3705 (95% CI: 0.0623 -0.6786) in log scale in each US state. Conclusions The positive associations between the proportion of vapers and the number of COVID-19 infected cases and deaths in each US state suggest an increased susceptibility of vapers to COVID-19 infections and deaths.",

COVID-19 infection presents with cough, dyspnea and fever among other systemic symptoms and can lead to pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. 3 Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), promoted as an alternative for cigarette smoking, rapidly gained popularity in recent years in the US. In 2018, the prevalence of current e-cigarette use (vaping) in US adults was 3.2%. 4 Recent studies on the associations of vaping and health symptoms/diseases have observed associations between vaping and symptoms of wheezing and self-reported Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), along with increased inflammation in bronchial epithelial cells and alterations in the pulmonary immune response to infection. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Tobacco control researchers have raised concerns that vapers may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infections and could develop more severe COVID-19 symptoms. 11 However, there is very limited evidence on the association between vaping and COVID-19",

A recent study based on 1099 COVID-19 patients found smoking history was associated with COVID-19 severity. 26 A recent systematic review on COVID-19 and smoking concludes that smoking is likely associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19. 27 However, other studies indicate that smoking might not be associated with the incidence and severity of COVID-19 28 , for example, a recent meta-analysis based on Chinese patients suggests that active smoking is not associated with severity of COVID-19. 29 It remains unclear whether nicotine has a role in the either the increased or decreased severity of illness for smokers with COVID-19. Our study did not find a significant association between the weighted proportion of smokers and the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths at state level. Due to the incomplete testing and tracking of home deaths, it is possible that a percentage of older smokers with comorbidities are dying at home from COVID-19 and therefore are not captured into the reported COVID-19 infections and death data 30, 31 Another possibility is that smokers with comorbidities are homebound and more likely to be All rights reserved.

Another limitation is that our current analysis is on state level instead of individual level. We don't know the individual status of vaping and COVID-19 infections or deaths, thus estimated coefficients of association could be different from epidemiological or clinical studies on individual subjects. Conclusions There are positive associations between the weighted proportion of vapers in each US state and the daily number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in each US state. These positive associations suggest vapers may have an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infections and deaths. Systematic assessment of vaping among patients, along with additional studies on the associations of vaping with COVID-19 infections and deaths at individual level are needed to confirm the identified positive association between vaping and COVID-19 infections and deaths.
