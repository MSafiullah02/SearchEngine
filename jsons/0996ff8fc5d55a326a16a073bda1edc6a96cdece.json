[2] Its use in humans to treat tapeworm infectionss tartedi n1 982f ollowing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has since been on the World Health Organization's essential listo fm edicines. Structurally,n iclosamide belongs to al arge group of lipophilic, weakly acidic molecules called salicylanilides( Figure 1 ). [3] Despite its wide use as an anthelminticdrug, the mechanism of action of niclosamide is yet to be completely understood. Early studies have linked niclosamide's activity to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. [4] However,o ver the last decadeo rs o, niclosamide has been shown to act on other targets such as Wnt/b-catenin, mTOR and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways (reviewed by Chen et al. [5] ), which inevitably linked niclosamide's therapeutic potentialt om any diseases that involve these important signaling cascades.T he increasing interest in niclosamide over the last decadei sr eflected in the significanti ncrease in the number of publications regarding the study of this drug ( Figure 2 ). Herein, we briefly discuss the numerous diseases niclosamide has shown promise in treating.",

            "text": "The disease that has received by far the most attention in the repurposing of niclosamide is cancer. To date, niclosamide has been shown to exhibit anticancer activitya gainst colon, [24] breast, [25] prostate, [26] glioblastoma, [27] osteosarcoma, [28] ovarian, [29] leukemia, [30] adrenocortical carcinoma, [31] lung, [32] and oral [33] cancers. [5] These observed anticancer activities have been linked to niclosamide'sa bility to damage tumor cell mitochondria, induce apoptosis, inhibitt umor cell proliferation, and inhibitv arious aberrantt umor signaling pathways including Wnt/b-catenin, mTORC1, STAT3, nuclear factor-kB( NF-kB) andN otch pathway (reviewedi nd etail by Moskaleva et al. [34] ). In addition to this broad-spectrum anticancer activity,n iclosamide was also shown to inhibit cancer stem cells, [35] which are considered an attractive and promising anticancer therapeutic target, as accumulatinge vidence has established their crucial role in cancer ChemMedChem 2018 ChemMedChem , 13,1088 ChemMedChem -1091 www.chemmedchem.org 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA, Weinheim initiation, progression, establishment, recurrence, and drug resistance. [36] Beyond its use as as ingle agent, niclosamide has been studied in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. For instance, the combination of niclosamide with cisplatin led to the inhibition of cisplatin-resistant triplenegative breast cancer [37] and exhibited synergistic effects in cisplatin-resistant lung cancerc ells. [38] Enhanced sensitivityo f chronic myeloid leukemia cells to dasatinib [39] and that of cervical cancer cells to paclitaxel [40] was also achieved when these drugs were used in combinationw ith niclosamide.S ynergistic effects with erlotinib in colon cancer, [41] head and neck cancer, [42] and in erlotinib-resistant non-smalll ung cancer cells [32] have also been described. While the combination of niclosamide with bicalutamidel ed to overcoming enzalutamideand bicalutamide-resistant prostate cancer, [43] the combination with abiraterone was found to be effective in treating advancedc astration-resistant prostatec ancer. [44] Furthermore, the use of niclosamide in conjunction with radiotherapy resulted in significant radiosensitizing effects in triple-negative breast cancer cells [45] and overcame radio-resistance in lung cancer. [46] Considerationsfor the Use of Niclosamidea sa Therapeutic Along with the interest in repurposing niclosamide for these variousd iseases, it must be noted that niclosamide's ability to influencem any signaling pathways mayw ork to its disadvantage, as it would lead to diverse side effects.A lso, the favorable safety profile of niclosamide in treating humans with tapeworm infection could be due to the fact that the site of action in this case is the gut and hence the drug is not absorbed to modulate various signalingc ascades andc ause side effects. With the newly discovered diseases for which niclosamide may have at herapeutic effect, systemic delivery maybe required and hence the safety profile of niclosamide in this case is still largely unknown. Currenta nd future in vivo studies on niclosamide will provide ac learer picture of its efficacy and toxicity, which will determine the successo ft hese repurposing initiatives.",
