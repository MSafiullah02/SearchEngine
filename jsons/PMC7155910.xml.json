Muscle relaxants are highly recommended.5 The video laryngoscope should be placed as soon as muscle relaxation is achieved, and tracheal intubation should be accomplished and confirmed as soon as possible (less than 15 to 20 s). Confirming the depth of the endotracheal tube is extremely difficult using auscultation while wearing isolation suits. It is recommended instead to observe bilateral chest expansion, ventilator breathing waveform, and respiratory parameters. End-tidal CO2 is a better indicator of successful tracheal intubation, as oxygen saturation is not always increased immediately after intubation in these patients, because the oxygen exchange is significantly impaired.",

Repeated tracheal intubation attempts could potentially increase virus spread, so a laryngeal mask should be inserted after an intubation failure. Fogging of goggles is a serious problem during rapid intubation, which can make intubation and airway management a major challenge for the care provider. Poor visibility also increases the risk for potential injury and infection. One solution to the problem of fogging may be to cover the inner side of the goggles with a layer of antifogging agent, such as transparent hand sanitizer.",

The outer layer of the protective device is removed after direct patient contact and before touching any equipment or furniture in other areas of the room; hand cleansing with disinfectant-containing alcohol is also necessary. Endotracheal intubation guided by a video laryngoscope with a disposable cover is recommended. Fiber optic intubation is feasible, but disinfection of the fibro bronchoscope system is inconvenient. The disposable cover should be removed and exchanged for a new disposable protective device after each intubation before moving to the next patient who needs intubation. The contaminated instruments must not be taken from the contaminated area to a clean area. They should be discarded or disinfected following strict guidelines. Particular care is necessary for the removal of potentially contaminated gloves, gowns, masks, and head covers; this contaminated clothing is disposed of as infectious materials.",
