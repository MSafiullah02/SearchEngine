            "text": "It is well known that the replication of RNA viruses and retroviruses proceeds without proofreading or editing of polymerase errors. Accordingly, their coding capacity is limited by the probability of generating a lethal mutation. Genome sizes range from the 3 kb of hepatitis B virus (HBV) up to the 27 to 32 kb typical of the coronaviruses. The error threshold is that mutation rate just compatible with viable replication. Chemical mutagenesis or the incorporation of ambiguous bases can displace mutation rates beyond the error threshold so resulting in the collapse of information.1, 2 Given this, many have wondered whether nature has not seized upon this singular vulnerability of RNA viruses and retroviruses to \u201cgoing over the edge.\u201d",

Multiple adenosine residues would be deaminated, resulting in inosine. As inosine base pairs as guanosine, adenosine editing generated A\u2192G hypermutants.3 Some years later another form of hypermutation cropped up among the classical retroviruses.4 Massive and monotonous substitution of G for A, involving up to 60% of G residues, was distributed across the entire 10\u2010kb HIV\u20101 genome. Although the frequency and degree of G\u2192A hypermutation are most striking for the lentiviral subgroup of retroviruses, which includes human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), elsewhere G\u2192A hypermutants have been described for only a handful of retroviruses including the \u201cother\u201d human retrovirus, human T\u2010cell leukemia virus (HTLV). The situation took a fascinating turn when Will's group sequenced a couple of subgenomic HBV DNA molecules from the serum of a single patient.5 The genomes showed signs of extensive G\u2192A substitution at a frequency typical of HIV G\u2192A hypermutants. Since then, these two hypermutants have remained the only such examples despite a burgeoning HBV database. The fact that G\u2192A hypermutation is found among viruses with obligatory reverse transcription steps, notably HBV and the primate lentiviruses, suggests a common mechanism occurring in the cytoplasm.",

Using a subtractive screen Malim's group in London showed that a single gene product, CEM15, was responsible for restricted HIV replication.6 When screened against the databases, CEM15 proved to be identical to APOBEC3G, which is part of a 7\u2010gene cluster that mapped to chromosome 22q13.7\n",

When cotransfected with human APOBEC3G, HBV DNA synthesis was strongly curtailed. Important controls showed that APOBEC3G was incorporated into the core particles yet did not affect hepatitis B c antigen (HBcAg) production. However, three findings suggest that HBV does not parallel the HIV hypermutation paradigm. Firstly, G\u2192A hypermutated HBV DNA was not found despite searching. Secondly, core\u2010associated HBV RNA was reduced more than 10\u2010fold, suggesting that the block in HBV DNA synthesis results primarily from an inhibition of viral pregenomic RNA packaging. Finally and remarkably, serine substitutions of functionally critical cysteine residues in APOBEC3G failed to abrogate the antiviral activity for HBV but did so in the HIV control\u2014so controls are useful!",

Each has a subtle sequence bias in the way it deaminates DNA. APOBEC3F shows a preference for cytidine in the context of TpC, while APOBEC3G prefers the CpC. Interestingly, the two naturally hypermutated subgenomes showed an overall bias for TpC, indicating that they were probably edited more by APOBEC3F than by APOBEC3G.5 This nicely fits with the new finding. As for HIV, the same two APOBEC3 members are involved in HBV restriction.",

Certainly the PKCa/\u03b2I / MEK / ERK pathway has been shown control basal levels of APOBEC3G mRNA in some T\u2010cell lines,18 which consequently declined when cells were treated with inhibitors or arrested in the G0 state of the cell cycle by serum starvation.

HBV has arguably been in primates for a longer period of time than has SIV\u2014the presence of HBV\u2010like viruses in gibbon and orangutan are cases in point.22, 23 The absence of HBV and SIV in the macaque lineage suggests that selection on APOBEC3G is probably unrelated to retroviruses.
