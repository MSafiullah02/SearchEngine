The stability of the analytes during the extraction process was evaluated for the following parameters; stability of extracted samples in extraction solution at 4\u00b0C for 24 h, stability of evaporated samples at 4\u00b0C for up to 72 h, and the stability in injection-ready samples in the LC autosampler at 4\u00b0C for up to 72 h. Spiked blood applied on Whatman 31 ET Chr paper was used to test different drying conditions of DBS in very high humidity conditions 27\u201332\u00b0C (88\u201392% relative humidity) and at dry conditions in a dry cabinet 20\u00b0C, 20% relative humidity. After spotting, the blood spots were left to dry for 1\u20132 h at ambient temperature and then transferred to different storage conditions. In wet tropical conditions, for example, rainy season, drying at ambient conditions is not possible and to simulate these conditions, the wet spot was directly transferred after blood spotting to a plastic bag and a desiccant was added to aid the drying process and the bag was then stored at ambient temperature. The DBS samples were left for 1\u20132 weeks in different environments and then analyzed against frozen (-80\u00b0C) reference samples.",

Identical LC methods were used for the analysis of samples from all three sample matrices (i.e., plasma, whole blood and DBS), enabling a simple and homogeneous method set up irrespective of sample matrix to be analyzed. Previously published bioanalytical methods (Table 1) show lower sensitivity and most often require a large sample volume to achieve adequate sensitivity, and they all have a longer analysis run time for each sample injection [19\u201325,28\u201331]. The simple separation method developed here results in excellent separation, using cleaner sample extraction techniques and shorter run time of 6.5 min for analysis and better sensitivity. All these advantages make this method ideal for implementation in routine drug analysis of large clinical pharmacokinetic trials.",

Chloroquine SRM transitions of m/z 320.2 > 247.2 contributed to chloroquine-D4 transition m/z 324.3 > 251.2 and resulted in inaccurate quantification data due to variations in the generated chloroquine-D4 signal. This phenomenon might occur if the isotope distribution of one compound overlay and interfere with another compound. In this case it is possible that one of the isotopes of chloroquine have a small contribution to chloroquine-D4 that will show its effect at high concentrations [46\u201349]. To prevent this mass interference, the second highest abundance transition m/z 324.3 > 146.3 was selected for chloroquine-D4. This transition had no interference with the chloroquine transition. Quantification was performed using SRM transitions of m/z 320.2 > 247.2 and 324.3 > 146.3 for chloroquine and chloroquine-D4, respectively, and 292.2 > 179.1 and 296.15 > 118.15 for desethylchloroquine and desethylchloroquine-D4, respectively. The collision energy was set to 29 V for all compounds. The developed detection method resulted in an unbiased robust method with high sensitivity. In some cases, a quantifier and a qualifier transition could increase the reliability of the results acquired. However, in this method, the reverse phase column has good retention and separation of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine, and this method also includes a sample clean-up step that further reduces the chance of interference. The quantifier\u2013qualifier transition would be required if only protein precipitation and direct injection were used, with none or very little chloroquine and desethylchloroquine separation and retention. Thus, a qualifier transition would be more beneficial to avoid false result. The quantifier and qualifier transitions should also be fairly similar in signal, and for chloroquine, the SRM signal of qualifier transition was roughly a thirdof quantifier signal. This would work for most of the calibration range except around LLOQ level where the signal would be close to undetectable.",

The recoveries differed between matrices and the extraction technique utilized. For DBS recovery, cellulose fibres in Whatman 31 ET Chr (\u03b2-anhydroglucose units with dominant hydroxyl groups) could possibly interact with chloroquine and desethylchloroquine and hence affect the extraction efficiency in the DBS method, resulting in lower recovery than whole blood and plasma methods [50]. Moreover, three extraction techniques, SPE, SLE+ and phospholipid removal were evaluated for DBS samples, of which, phospholipid removal was the simplest method to use, which also gave the best recovery. For whole blood, only SPE using a CBA column gave clean enough extracts, which also produced the highest recoveries. For plasma, both phospholipid removal and SLE+ technique give similar recoveries; however, the SLE+ gave less phospholipid residues and the evaporated sample could also be dissolved in a mobile phase-optimized solution improving the chromatographic performance.",

Postcolumn infusion did not show any signs of ion suppression/enhancement for chloroquine or desethylchloroquine and their stable isotope-labeled internal standards (Figure 2, represents a DBS-extracted sample injected during postcolumn infusion), generating a matrix factor close to one for all compounds. Minor ion suppression/enhancement was fully compensated by the stable isotope-labeled internal standards, resulting in normalized matrix effects close to one (with low variation) for both chloroquine and desethylchloroquine (Table 2). Injecting commonly used antimalarial drugs (potentially co-administered in a clinical setting) in a normal LC run did not produce any interfering peaks (data not shown) and should not have any impact on the quantification of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine. The second metabolite of chloroquine, bisdesethylchloroquine, was not included in this method as it is found in much lower concentrations and not widely used in pharmacokinetic studies. However, although we do not know the retention time of bisdesethylchloroquine, the chance of it interfering would be considered very low, as it would very likely have separated on the column. The difference of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine (which both are well separated) is an ethyl group; hence, a loss of another ethyl group as in bisdesethylchloroquine would change the retention even further.

Filter papers with similar properties to the Whatman 31 ET Chr can be used as alternative (i.e., Whatman DMPK-C, 903 Protein as well as Ahlstrom 226). The thinner and denser Whatman 3 MM Chr paper may cause blood to flow out as a noncircular and nonhomogeneous spot, especially at high hematocrit, and is therefore not recommended for the DBS quantification method. The thin paper also absorbed less blood per surface area, causing a blood volume bias when blood discs were punched out from the blood spot compared with the thicker papers. Obviously, mixing papers with different properties in a clinical trial setting will affect the quantification, resulting in incorrect concentrations and loss of accuracy and precision. The different hematocrit levels evaluated (20, 40 and 60%) might affect the physical size of the blood spot depending on the paper used and hence the amount of blood obtained in a punched disc. DBS methods for antimalarial drug studies should be able to cover studies from healthy volunteers to clinical malaria cases with anemia, and the hematocrit range will therefore be very wide. Malaria patients usually have low hematocrit and in severe malaria hematocrit below 20% can be found [51]. However, using whole blood at different hematocrit levels to create DBS and comparing it to a calibration curve with a hematocrit of 45% did not show any major impact on the quantification of chloroquine or desethylchloroquine.

Humid conditions should be avoided to prevent fungus growth, which might affect drug quantification. However, DBS samples should dry completely before long-term storage in plastic bags in the presence of a desiccant. Samples can then be stored at room temperature as long as they are kept dry.

All methods proved reliable and robust performance for the analysis of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine in whole blood, DBS and plasma patient samples from clinical trials. The whole blood method was used to analyze 1600 samples from a vivax malaria recurrence study. The DBS method was used to analyze 620 samples from children treated with chloroquine for vivax malaria and the plasma method was used to analyze 182 plasma samples from a healthy volunteer study. The selected calibration range for plasma, whole blood and DBS proved suitable for the concentration measurements of the study samples. Below is a representative graph of a pharmacokinetic concentration-time profile in plasma samples from an adult (Figure 4A) receiving a single oral dose of chloroquine (600 mg) and from a separate study, a child (Figure 4B) bodyweight 22 kg receiving oral chloroquine with a total dose of 1550 mg over 5 days and samples collected as DBS, analyzed using the developed methods. Chloroquine and desethylchloroquine gave maximum concentrations similar to previously described studies [52\u201354,56], which also reported a Cmax after 3\u20139 h and a slow elimination phase due to high volume of distribution into the body's adipose tissue giving a long terminal elimination half-life [16,52,53,57]. Chloroquine concentrations were higher than its metabolite desethylchloroquine (Figure 4A & B); however, both have the same activity against parasites [58]. Chloroquine is giving higher concentrations in DBS compared with plasma due to its ability to accumulate in red blood cell [16\u201318]. The reliability of all validated methods was confirmed by repeated analysis of some of the patient samples, known as incurred sample reanalysis [59]. For incurred sample reanalysis evaluation, patient samples were selected across the concentration profile and analyzed in a separate run [59]. Furthermore, the DBS method enabled capillary finger-prick sampling in a pediatric field study, a pharmacokinetic study that would not have been practically or ethically possible without the development of this analysis method.",

The developed methods use different sample extraction techniques to simplify the extraction procedure for each matrix. However, all methods use identical separation and detection techniques to maximize the sample throughput and allow for implementation of methods in a high-throughput routine clinical trial setting. The DBS methodology enables clinical field trials in vulnerable populations where large volumes are not ethically and/or practically possible, such as small children. Since no centrifugation or cold chain is needed, it also enables pharmacokinetic studies to be performed in rural field sites and at a lower cost. All methods were demonstrated to be robust and reliable when used for drug quantification in clinical patient samples from large pharmacokinetic clinical trials.",

These bioanalytical methods using LC\u2013MS/MS presented here, provided rugged and robust results in both method validation and clinical samples. These new methods are easy to automate, and consequently will reduce the time for processing large number of clinical pharmacokinetic samples. The sample extraction and clean-up step incorporates modern faster sample processing techniques such as, phospholipids removal 96-well plate for DBS sample, and supported liquid extraction 96-well plate for plasma sample. Moreover, clinical studies for malaria treatment are often located in rural areas where sample storage and transportation are more challenging making DBS as a sample collection technique more important. The DBS technique will not only save time and money, it is also very suitable for vulnerable populations such as small children with only a small amount of blood required for analysis.",
