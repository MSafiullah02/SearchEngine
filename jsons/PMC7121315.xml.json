These policies affect health services and health care systems, and medical managers often play a significant role in moulding these policies and implementing them effectively.Australia has an ageing population, with associated increases in chronic diseases. It also has an ageing health workforce with implications for the supply of care in the future.Historical public health interventions include public sanitation, clean water and food supplies, and immunisation programmes. Recent efforts can be seen through tobacco and seatbelt legislation.The spread of communicable diseases can overwhelm health services quickly and the management requires a structured approach with good command procedures and clear communication channels in place. Medical managers also play a critical role in ensuring best practice infection control processes developed in health services including antimicrobial stewardship programmes, increasing hand hygiene compliance rates, and encouraging staff vaccinations.There has been significant effort by governments to reduce smoking rates, mainly through taxation and legislation, and improvements are starting to be seen. Attempts to promote a safe drinking culture are still ongoing, but one of the largest challenges the health system is facing is the abuse of illicit drugs, and in particular methamphetamines recently. It will require a coordinated approach from relevant sectors to change this tide.Chronic diseases pose a significant burden to Australia and other developed countries. It requires novel ways of managing these patients, including use of risk stratification, predictive analytics, encouraging self-care and case management.Regional and rural populations have a different set of challenges compared to metropolitan populations due health conditions associated with lower socio-economic status and access to general and specialist care.The Indigenous population in Australia have much poorer health outcomes than their non-Indigenous counterparts.
