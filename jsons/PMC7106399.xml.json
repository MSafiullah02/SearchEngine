Lower respiratory tract infections\u2014an inclusive terminology for pneumonia (both typical and atypical), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014remains a global paediatric health problem. Worldwide, more than 2 million children die of pneumonia annually.5 In a recent review of child mortality from preventable causes, pneumonia ranked second, and is responsible for 21% of deaths in children under the age of 5 years in low-income countries,6 especially in Africa and Asia, where 70% of deaths occur. Aetiological studies, which have been done largely in developing countries, suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae may be the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia worldwide (figure\n),7, 8, 9 but accurate estimates of pathogen-specific attributable disease burden have been elusive.",

Children are often brought to medical attention with fever and difficulty breathing with or without cough. Tachypnoea accompanied by crackles on auscultation suggests a diagnosis of pneumonia, although crackles are often not heard in children, particularly when the child is dehydrated.10 Wheezing is often associated with viral or mycoplasma infections. The WHO developed a guideline that recommends tachypnoea as the main indicator for the clinical diagnosis of lower respiratory infection (respiratory rate >50 breaths/min in infants and >40 breaths/min in children 1 year or older).11 Although the presence of tachypnoea may be the best way to distinguish lower from upper respiratory infection, there are no uniform criteria for initiating patient work-up with, for example, a chest radiograph or blood culture. The WHO recommendation has been useful in most developing countries for initiating antibiotic treatment or hospitalisation. However, in more developed countries, where laboratory and radiological investigations are done generously, criteria for diagnosis have been less stringent. The absence of uniform and objective criteria for the diagnosis of pneumonia has implications for the determination of the true burden of childhood pneumonia.",

The potential clinical impact of this observation is yet to be fully established. However, two studies from the Netherlands and Israel have suggested, based on epidemiological evidence, that S pneumoniae might compete with S aureus in colonisation.16, 17\n",

However, mucosal IgA responses following parenteral vaccination were usually low and only detected in a proportion of vaccinees.

In 44 children, one species of bacterium was isolated from blood (six cases), lung culture (30 cases), or both (eight cases), while in eight children two species were isolated from lung or pleural aspirate, thus indicating that blood culture isolate may not always reflect the offending pathogen in the lung. In the group of children with lobar pneumonia or empyema, blood culture alone yielded a bacterial pathogen in 18 cases, while the addition of percutaneous lung aspirate or pleural aspiration increased the yield to 52 cases. In studies of lung aspirates, conventional bacterial culture techniques have been done to determine the aetiology of pneumonia. Although this technique has been revealing, the yield may be considerably enhanced by molecular methods such as nucleic acid amplification techniques. In addition, since aspirates are done only on lung consolidation that is adjacent to the chest wall, the true burden of pneumonia prevented by vaccination using lung aspirates will be underestimated. Further, alveolar consolidation on chest radiographs may only detect 37% of the pneumonia that is otherwise preventable by vaccination.38\n",

This observation generated a lot of interest because other bacterial pneumonia vaccine studies were planned and standardisation of chest radiographs for vaccine efficacy studies was pursued. An effort to standardise the interpretation of chest radiographs, specifically for the purpose of evaluating the impact of vaccines on pneumonia, was initiated by the WHO. In 1998, a group of paediatricians and radiologists was set up to develop a consensus.44 Briefly, inter-observer variability in categorising chest radiographic images was measured by comparing the readings of 20 radiologists and clinicians against a reference set of 222 radiographic films. Intra-observer variability was measured by comparing the initial readings of a randomly chosen subset of 100 radiographs with repeat readings made 1\u20134 weeks later. The standardised definitions improved agreement substantially among members of the group for the identification of radiological pneumonia. Although the report provides a valuable guideline and an excellent tool for the evaluation of radiological pneumonia as an outcome measure in paediatric bacterial pneumonia vaccine efficacy trials or for epidemiological studies, unanswered questions remain. The definition of alveolar consolidation as proposed by the group needs to be formally evaluated to establish its correlation with bacterial pneumonia. Radiological pneumonia as proposed by the group is unlikely to be of use in the clinical setting where radiographs are evaluated in the context of clinical presentation and the indications for obtaining a chest radiograph vary considerably.",

The study from South Africa30 and The Gambia35 used the standards recommended by the WHO Trialist Group for the interpretation of chest radiographs.44 However, the clinical indication for obtaining a chest radiograph in the South African study was based on individual study-physician assessment and was not standardised. When case reduction in all lower respiratory tract infection episodes was used as a benchmark for measuring the sensitivity of a standardised study endpoint of radiological pneumonia prevented by vaccination in South African HIV-uninfected children, chest radiography detected 58\u00b71% (95% CI 50\u00b73\u201365\u00b76%) of pneumococcal pneumonia that was prevented by vaccination.38 In The Gambia, the sensitivity of chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia in detecting the burden of pneumonia prevented by vaccination was 76\u00b75% (95% CI 50\u00b71\u201393\u00b72%).35 The importance of modifying the current clinical definition of lower respiratory tract infections to improve specificity for pneumococcal pneumonia was corroborated by findings in South Africa38 when, on further analysis, exclusion of children with wheezing in the absence of chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia provided the most sensitive measure of vaccine-preventable pneumonia. Using this refined definition of clinical pneumonia, the sensitivity of chest radiograph-confirmed pneumonia in diagnosing the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia preventable by vaccination was only 37\u00b75% (95% CI 31\u00b76\u201343\u00b76%).38 Despite the differences in radiological pneumonia in The Gambia compared with that observed in South Africa and the USA, the overall reduction in lower respiratory tract infections was similar between all the studies (6\u20139%).

The identification of markers of infection for discriminating between bacterial and viral pneumonia would have enormous potential for reducing the cost of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Peripheral leucocytosis and/or raised erythrocyte sedimentation rates can corroborate bacterial pneumonia but neither reliably differentiates viral from bacterial pneumonia. Similarly, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and interleukin 6 levels are raised in bacterial pneumonia, but no reliable cut-off levels have been defined for clinical use. Considerable overlap in these values has made interpretation of levels difficult.51 A hypotheses-generating study52 of data from the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial suggested that a CRP concentration of at least 120 mg/L or more and procalcitonin of at least 5 ng/mL (as adjunct markers of pneumococcal pneumonia) substantially improved the specificity of chest radiography in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. However, this improvement in specificity was achieved by sacrificing the sensitivity (13\u00b79%; 95% CI 9\u00b79\u201318\u00b76%) of this outcome in detecting the absolute burden of pneumococcal pneumonia that was prevented by vaccination.38, 52 Although the combination of acute phase reactants and radiology for diagnosis is promising, its value warrants evaluation in prospective trials. The combination may be useful for minimising sample sizes required for evaluating vaccine efficacy (ie, through improved specificity of the study outcome measure); however, poor sensitivity would preclude its use in the measurement of the absolute burden of disease prevented by vaccination. Definition of markers that are useful for distinguishing between bacterial and viral pneumonia has been handicapped by the poor sensitivity of currently available tools for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia. This has recently been corroborated by using the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine as a probe in defining the minimal contribution of pneumococcal coinfection in children hospitalised with viral-associated pneumonia and determining the sensitivity of blood cultures for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia. In the absence of immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, at least 30% of hospitalised viral-associated pneumonia was attributed to pneumococcal coinfections, albeit there being no difference in the prevalence of pneumococcal bacteraemia (3%) between vaccine and placebo recipients.53 In a study of children attending daycare centres in Israel54 there was reduction in the incidence of presumed viral lower respiratory tract infections and a reduction in antibiotic use for lower respiratory tract infections.54\n",

However, there is little doubt that bacterial polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines have made a substantial impact in the battle against invasive bacterial diseases of childhood to date. The frustration associated with the lack of refined clinical and laboratory diagnostic tools to more quantitatively define the reduction in disease burden has prompted investigators to use the vaccine as a \u201cprobe\u201d to define disease burden. The advantages and shortcomings of using this vaccine probe approach for the determination of disease burden was the subject of a recent review.57 Although the approach provides a powerful tool for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy against disease, disease reduction would only be proportional to vaccine efficacy against study-specified outcome measures, more appropriately referred to as vaccine-preventable disease. The proportion of disease prevented by vaccination will only be equal to disease burden when the vaccine has an efficacy of 100%. Since no such vaccine exists and, for licensed vaccines, efficacies vary in different populations, using this approach to define disease burden will underestimate the true disease burden. Although this strategy provides a powerful and unequivocal tool for the evaluation of reduction in all-cause morbidity and mortality, as demonstrated in The Gambia,35 the true burden of pneumococcal pneumonia remains undetermined because the vaccine impacts other forms of disease in addition to pneumonia.",

In general, early onset disease (onset within the first week of life) occurs from bacterial infection of the amniotic fluid or colonisation of the maternal genital tract. Gram-negative bacteria are the predominant pathogens during the first week of life and Gram-positive bacteria thereafter. Intrauterine pneumonia is a component of early onset disease and may result in stillbirth. There have been conflicting reports on the incidence of neonatal group B streptococcal infections in developing and developed countries. A study of the aetiology of serious bacterial infections in young infants in several developing countries suggest that group B streptococcus was uncommon.61 This study recruited infants from an outpatient setting and would have missed out on the substantial burden of early onset disease. This report contrasts with recent observation from Kenya.62\n",

A clinical distinction between early onset pneumonia and hyaline membrane disease is virtually impossible because of the similarity in radiological findings in these conditions. Blood culture yield is likely to be lower, given the smaller volume of blood specimen that is often available for culture. In one study from Brazil of 318 neonates who presented with respiratory distress within the first 72 hours of life, bacterial infection was proven by culture in 31 (9.7%) and 62 (19.5%) had radiographic changes suggestive of pneumonia.63 There are few aetiological studies of neonatal pneumonia that used lung tap for diagnosis. Two of these studies from India reported bacterial culture or bacterial antigen studies of lung aspirate and suggest that Escherichia coli and S pneumoniae are important causes of neonatal pneumonia.64, 65\n",

Several studies have demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine administered during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, and more recently with a conjugate group B streptococcal vaccine.66 Immunisation with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines has been shown to be safe and immunogenic when administered in late pregnancy68, 69, 70, 71, 72 and functional serotype-specific antibodies have been detected in breast milk several months after delivery.73, 74, 75 Provided efficacy can be demonstrated, immunising mothers during pregnancy could offer the potential benefit of protection from pneumococcal disease for the mother and for the infant and protection from more pneumococcal serotypes than is currently available in the licensed heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine during the first several months of life. In addition, for such infants it may be possible to achieve adequate immune protection with the use of fewer doses of the conjugate vaccine later in infancy. Overall, given the complexity of the pathogenesis and broad spectrum of aetiological agents, control of neonatal pneumonia would involve other general supportive health-care interventions in addition to immunisation of women before or during pregnancy.",

With these vaccines, pneumonia caused by these pathogens has been well controlled in several (mostly developed) countries where the use of either or both of these vaccines has become routine. However, the vaccines remain out of reach of children in most developing countries where substantial global burden of disease, morbidity, and mortality occur. Although the Global Alliance for Vaccine Initiative has been instrumental in making Hib conjugate vaccines available to some developing countries, lack of pathogen-specific pneumonia burden data remains a major obstacle to convincing health policy planners and political leaders of the need for such vaccines in developing countries. Even in some affluent countries, the perceived burden of disease has not provided economic justification for routine use of some of these vaccines. Although vaccine probe studies have been very informative, they are expensive, experimental, and at best only provide estimates of vaccine-preventable study-specified disease outcome. The development of better tools to determine the microbiological diagnosis of pneumonia is critical for the demonstration of disease burden. Such tools are vital for indicating both the need for vaccines and for monitoring the epidemiology of pneumonia thereafter. While the true burden of pneumonia remains unknown because of diagnostic difficulties, these vaccines provide minimum attributable rate reductions. Although the data may be incomplete because of diagnostic imprecision, the challenge is not when the data will be complete but when it is sufficient for initiating public-health decisions.",
