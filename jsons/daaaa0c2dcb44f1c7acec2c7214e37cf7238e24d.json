            "text": "This was apparent, especially during the debate of the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that the US president touted, with and without azithromycin, as a possible treatment for COVID-19. The ensuing debate was passionately based on party lines. As soon as the drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for off-label use, the debate started. Republicans said it was wise to take the drug for prevention and to prescribe it in different stages of the disease. Democrats and their media supporters and experts declared war upon the off-label-use approval and emphasized the drug's toxicity; they also warned of a shortage of the drug for the patients who need it for other conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.",

Remdesivir was better received by the media, and surprisingly, The New England Journal of Medicine published the results of a small registry of b70 patients without a control group [1] . In addition, a leak from a phase 3 clinical trial testing remdesivir bumped the stock market. So why was there differential treatment by the media and their rented pseudo experts to promote or demote these two drugs? Is it because the president promoted one drug and not the other, or is it because there is a strong pharmaceutical company behind the development of remdesivir while hydroxychloroquine is a generic, low-cost drug?",

            "text": "What was missing in this political debate over therapy was the voice of science and the professional societies in this debate, which was based on anecdotal testimonies. Perhaps the leaders were too busy sharing their expert opinions with media outlets, when everyone in front of a camera becomes royalty. The truth of the matter is that when the science is weak, false statements, even by respected individuals, play into the hand of the politicians and the media to serve their special interest and add more confusion, anxiety, and polarization. As of now, the preliminary studies of both hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir, although not conclusive, are disappointing. The FDA subsequently issued a warning against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, recommending that the drugs only be used within clinical trials or in hospital settings. The lesson hopefully learned is that there is no substitute to a well-designed and powered prospective randomized clinical trial. Until we have one to support the optimal therapy for a COVID-19, we will continue to play the guessing and intuition game and will make mistakes that may be associated with serious side effects and may cost life. Although adequate trials will take thousands of patients and time, there are no shortcuts. If you don't want to repeat history, you should not compromise the integrity of the science.",

            "text": "Meanwhile, thousands of patients are dying daily worldwide, and we are all passionate to try something that may work and eager to treat our patients now. So why not provide a myriad of experimental regimens on a compassionate basis before we know the results of the trials? What are we going to lose in prescribing these regimens to dying patients? This is an ethical dilemma and uncharted territory, which raises important challenges. What are the boundaries? How much background data are needed before we start with a new experimental drug? Which patients should get involved and at what stage of the disease? What should be the control group? Who is in control of the data and the integrity of the results? In the US, the FDA is the highest authority to address many of the above questions and to approve study designs, labeling, and indications of existing therapies and new therapies. It is the role of the FDA to give the healthcare providers the best information available on safety and efficacy, but healthcare providers should be allowed, in certain situations, to use approved drugs or devices off label for other indications, as not every indication can be tested. In situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, there should be more leverage for choice of care, as long as the risk versus benefit is adequately communicated to patients. Over the past decade, the FDA has transformed into an efficient, science-based agency that works together with industry and academia. Timelines have been drastically cut. The agency has become accessible, transparent, and efficient, but perhaps that was not enough to face the current, unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, it was the FDA that allowed the off-label use of approved drugs and new drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. As of early May, as I write this, N72 trials testing different drugs and drug combinations had been approved by FDA, and they are ongoing in the US and globally.",

Jumping from one regimen to another and changing policies on a weekly basis may not be considered adaptive, but destructive, and could cause setbacks. The transition from premarketing to postmarketing to accelerate access to novel therapies is welcome, but with that, there are principles that should be kept. The decision has to be based on scientific grounds free from political and media pressure. The FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should both champion and partner with academic institutions to gather the totality of the data from all trials and analyze it on scientific merits. We should rely on big data, not on small and anecdotal case reports. A central bank of data should be created and analyzed by the best biostatisticians in the world. This would enable physicians to provide optimal and precise care, allowing the use of novel therapies on our patients.",

If successful, this could be a precedent for approval of studies and devices on a similar fasttrack pathway for therapies for other diseases and promoting shifting studies from the premarket to the postmarket phase. In addition, it is time to provide the level of evidence for safety and efficacy for each therapy modality or device on the basis of the data available. A similar approach may be exercised toward the different tests for COVID-19, when the test gets initial approval for use but gets final approval after the makers of the test can validate its performance.",
