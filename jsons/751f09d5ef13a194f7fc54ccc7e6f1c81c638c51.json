C Five special groups established for training and examination, management and supervision, psychological support, logistical support, and reporting and publicity ensured the sustainability of prevention and control work Since December 2019, some patients with the Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) have been found in Wuhan. With the spread of the epidemic, such cases have also been found in other regions of China and abroad [1] . On January 31, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern [2] . Our hospital is a provincial-level designated hospital in Zhejiang Province, which treats critically ill patients transferred from all over the province. It is the main battlefield to fight against the epidemic in the province. COVID-19 can be transmitted from human-to-human. Nurses, as the main force in treating patients, are facing great risks and challenges on the frontline of the anti-epidemic battle, and the Nursing Department is the key department to implement prevention and control work. The Nursing Department of our hospital has taken a series of contingency management measures such as early warning, continuous promotion, and tackling difficulties in centralized rescue, and has carried out the task of massive rescue well.",

Patients attending the clinic scanned the two-dimensional code with their mobile phones for online pre-screening and triage and filled in personal information, epidemiological history, and fever-related symptoms. After submission, the system would automatically prompt patients to enter fever clinic area A (for common fever) or fever clinic area B (for suspected cases) for treatment. This process improvement is simple and convenient to operate, and is conducive to reducing the occurrence of cross infection in the hospital.",

The branch area would focus on the treatment of confirmed patients, while the main hospital area retained the fever clinic. In order to treat patients safely, orderly, and efficiently, various procedures need to be formulated and optimized; for example, the admission process for outpatients from different fever clinics, the referral process for patients from other hospitals in the province, the patient transfer process in hospital and ICU admission process, etc. The actual status in front-line work was investigated to optimize. For example, details of patient information were filled on the hospitalization application form, especially noting \"suspected\" or \"confirmed\". The one-way flow of patient admission was confirmed. After patients being released by the fever clinic, the nurse's station of the isolation ward would be notified in on time to receive the patient for treatment. Preparation of protection and isolation should be completed before the implementation of intra-hospital transfers. All documentary processes and the address list were sent to all nurse stations in the hospital.",

(2) Occupational protection levels were determined according to relevant documents [4, 5] . COVID-19 has characteristics of interpersonal transmission and cross-city transmission [10] . Healthcare professionals working in the isolation ward should wear medical protective clothing (plus disposable anti-infiltration isolation gown), medical protective mask, working cap, goggles, and double-layer latex gloves when providing airway care may come into contact with aerosol. Personnel in the fever clinic should wear work clothes, disposable anti-seepage isolation gown, medical protective mask, working cap, goggles and latex gloves. All staff that may be exposed should wear surgical masks and have good hand hygiene. (3) Critical care and nursing standards: According to the clinical guidelines for COVID-19 issued by WHO [11] on January 28 and the diagnosis and treatment protocol issued by the National Health Commission [1] , standards of early supportive treatment and monitoring, prediction and early warning of severe cases, nasal high-flow oxygen therapy for hypoxic respiratory failure, examination and protection of ventilation in the prone position, etc. were formulated.",
