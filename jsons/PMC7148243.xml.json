To make sense of the millions of available tracks (e.g., 40 million on Apple Music and 30 million on Spotify), playlists have become an essential feature of many music streaming platforms for organizing music, mediating how users experience the service. Across platforms, most playlists are manually curated and managed by a group of music curators, which consists of both \u201cregular\u201d users and expert tastemakers. To benefit from the power of human curation [15], many platforms enable users to follow these music curators to receive updates of their listening activities, e.g., to discover new tracks, albums, or playlists (as illustrated in Fig. 1(a)).",

First, music curators themselves are complex amalgamations of the playlists they create, the tracks they select, and their unique style. For example, some curators may focus on specific emotions (like happy or excited), eras (like the 80s or 90s), or situations (like workouts, parties, or road trips), while others cross boundaries (like happy 80s music, or 90s road trip). Hence the first challenge is: How can we build models that capture these stylistic differences across music curators taking both their curating coverage and individual style into consideration? To illustrate, we conduct an initial exploration of Spotify curators whose areas of interest can be inferred from their user IDs. We represent each of the music curators using the average of audio features (see Sect. 3.2 for details) for all the tracks in playlists they curate and plot the 2D t-SNE distribution in Fig. 1(b). We see that there are clear patterns of curator coverage: country music curators cluster together in the top-right, curators focusing on active music for sports and workouts cluster in the top-left, while classical and instrumental music curators dominate the lower portion. We see that curators have preferences in the coverage of music they would curate. However, coverage alone is insufficient to distinguish between curators. We must also consider individual style. Considering the playlists curated by three classical music curators (in the bottom of the figure), while all drawing from the same musical coverage area, each of them displays a unique style \u2013 one groups tracks for activities like work or study, one collects tracks featuring the same instrument, while the third groups by artists. We see that curators who curate similar types of music can have different style in deciding how tracks go with each other.",

These preferences may only be revealed through extremely sparse user feedback. For example, in a sample of Spotify playlists (see Sect. 4.1) we find that only 0.20% of all user-curator pairs have a following relationship. And for pairs without a following relationship, it may mean the user dislikes the curator or just has not known her yet. Furthermore, because anyone can be a curator on these platforms, there are many long-tail candidate curators who may be invisible to most users. Hence the second challenge is: How can we uncover the hidden taste preferences that connect users to the music curators they may prefer?",

Through experiments over a Spotify dataset, we find the proposed framework results in a 20.5% and 5.7% improvement in top-k F1 score compared to Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and Neural Personalized Ranking (NPR), and in a 24.9% and 21.4% improvement in cold start scenarios.",

Complementary to our focus on recommending curators, many researchers have explored music continuation and automated playlist generation. For example, [12] predicts the next track based on a listener\u2019s preferences and most-recently played tracks. DJ-MC [14] aims to recommend track sequences based on reinforcement learning. Groove Radio [1] generates personalized playlists based on seed artists. EFM [2] recommends both tracks and playlists through a new embedding approach. There are also efforts on training an embedding model on users\u2019 historical music playing sequences to estimate the similarity between songs for recommendation [5, 24].

For example, some classical music lovers may create playlists based on the time period (e.g., 1800 s) or for different artists. Some may focus on the particular instrument featured, while others may curate based on feelings, activities (e.g., for studying or focusing), or locations (e.g., for \u201ccoffee shop\u201d). Modeling these styles is important for accurately connecting users to their preferred curators. A purely content-based approach to model style (e.g., based on composer, time period, or audio features of the track) may face challenges in determining these subtle stylistic choices that motivate a curator.\n",

The intuition is that when users create or follow playlists, they provide implicit linkages between tracks in the same playlist. Hence, a key hypothesis is that tracks in a particular playlist are in high coherence, regardless of their underlying audio-based signature. Inspired by word2vec [17], we propose to learn a vector representation for each track from the curation-based perspective of how tracks cohere with other tracks. We can treat tracks as \u201cwords\u201d and find neighboring tracks within a window. In many music services, users can shuffle the playlists, meaning that tracks arrive in a random order. Hence, tracks within a playlist will have high coherence, regardless of their immediate order in the playlist. To simulate this shuffle activity, we randomly reorder the music tracks in each playlist to generate the shuffled track sequences (see Fig. 2(b)). Then we treat each shuffled track sequence as a \u201csentence\u201d and each music track as a \u201cword\u201d.

Relative to traditional collaborative filtering, we see that BPR\u2019s relaxed assumption of users\u2019 unobserved implicit feedback and pairwise ranking model is more effective for this task. Perhaps surprisingly, the Most Popular (MP) recommender performs slightly better than both UCF and BPR. Currently, Spotify suggests users with popular verified curators and friends on Facebook.
