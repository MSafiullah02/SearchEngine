Our experience suggests that any COVID-19 patient should be considered a priori as having a difficult airway given the severity of hypoxaemia, difficulties arising from wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and the challenging work environment. Obese patients might be at higher risk of difficult airway management 2 , and obesity seems to be both a risk factor for developing COVID-19 3 and for poorer outcome 4 . In most COVID-19 patients, tracheal intubation can be performed semi-electively, allowing time for patient assessment, team preparation and discussion of airway management strategy 3 . This includes patient positioning 2 and primary use of videolaryngoscopy given its efficacy and lower risk of contamination 3 . We believe that maximizing first-pass success is of paramount importance in COVID-19 patients to reduce the risk of respiratory and haemodynamic complications and airway team contamination. It is unclear from their description to what extent Abou-Arab and colleagues were anticipating difficulty in managing the airway and what preparatory steps were taken.",

In addition to aiding the decision about the timing of intubation 3 , this mode of respiratory support could have been used for preoxygenation, which is especially effective in hypoxaemic obese patients 2,3 . Of the two patients presented, one received high-flow nasal oxygen, the role of which is debated in COVID-19 patients,",

The likelihood of successful tracheal bougie placement with a grade IV laryngeal view is quite low, whereas the risk of airway trauma due to blind bougie insertion is significant, so that use of a bougie in such a scenario is considered contraindicated 5 . The two reported cases substantiate this concept. Other factors could have contributed to the reported airway trauma.",

This may be exacerbated by the inflamed airway mucosa in COVID-19 patients which is likely to be frail and more prone to injury. The Chinese experience quotes a 5.9% incidence of pneumothorax during intubation in COVID-19 patients, but no association with bougie use is reported 7 . The authors did not state if signs for confirming tracheal bougie placement, such as hold-up or tracheal clicks, were used. It was not clear from the report if only the bougie was inserted and withdrawn in the absence of position confirmation, or if the tracheal tube was removed after being railroaded over the bougie in the absence of tracheal placement confirmation. Such a clarification would facilitate understanding of the airway trauma mechanisms in the two reported cases, which could be associated with the tube as well rather than with the bougie alone.",

Any bougie advance past the carina carries a high risk of airway trauma 5 , hence it should not be inserted more than 8 cm past the vocal cords 5, 9 .
