H5N1 viruses could also cause disseminated infections in either naturally or experimentally infected mammalian species, i.e., tiger, leopard, and ferret [5\u201310]. However, evidence for extrapulmonary replication of H5N1 viruses in humans, in general, has been lacking at present. Some studies had found H5N1 viruses exclusively in respiratory tract (mainly in lung) [11, 12]. Other studies had found the presence of H5N1 viruses in many extrapulmonary organs, such as intestine, liver, and brain, which indicated that virus dissemination seems to occur in some humans through blood circulation or other ways [13\u201317]. In March 2006, the first case of avian influenza H5N1 virus infection was identified in Guangdong province of China. An autopsy was then conducted to detect the virus distribution and load, which, we hoped, would provide some insights into H5N1 infection and replication in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary organs.",

A chest radiograph obtained on admission showed evidence of left lower pneumonia. His condition was rapidly deteriorated, featured by consecutive high body temperature and dysfunctions of multiple systems, including respiratory system, circulatory system, central nervous system, liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal system. Chest radiograph revealed a massive consolidation shadow in both lungs on February 28, which, however, was much more severe in the left lung. Despite active treatment, the patient finally died from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicated with multiple organ failure (MOF) on March 2. None of the anti-influenza drugs, such as oseltamivir or amantadine, were used in the treatment.",

            "text": "The HA cleavage site of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses contains multiple basic amino acids, which could be hydrolyzed by a broader range of cellular proteases, so that the tissue tropism for H5N1 viruses is not restricted to the lungs, but extends to other organs, including the brain [30, 31]. A boy confirmed as H5N1 infected presented with severe diarrhea and acute encephalitis symptoms, and H5N1 virus was isolated from patient\u2019s throat, serum, feces, and the cerebrospinal fluid [32]. In addition to lung tissues, some studies had detected both positive- and negative-stranded RNA in large intestine, small intestine, and liver, suggesting the possibility of viral replication in the intestines and liver [15, 24]. Furthermore, viral gene sequences and antigen were detectable in neurons of the brain, T cells of the lymph node, and Hofbauer cells of the placenta, which was indicative of viral replication in extrapulmonary tissues [29]. The H5N1 virus obtained from the patient has multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, which has molecular characteristics of the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [33]. The viral RNA was detectable in the patient\u2019s lung and spleen in our study. These findings suggested that H5N1 viruses might be transmitted to extrapulmonary tissues, causing disseminate infection. However, viral distribution and replication vary to a certain extent from individual to individual, which might be explained by tissue tropism differences of viral strains, or that viral distribution might differ in different stages of disease progression, or that different individuals reacted differently to H5N1 viruses.",
