The initial assumption is based on two recent papers reporting the clinical experience in China, during the dramatic epidemic now becoming a pandemic [3, 4] . Both articles suggest that patients affected by COVID-19 frequently had concomitant chronic pathologies, especially hypertension and diabetes mellitus, pathologies that might be treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Fang based their intriguing theory, of an increased risk of COVID-19 infection on patients treated with ACE inhibitors, on the relationship between the ACE system, which can be influenced by anti-inflammatory medicines, and the lung epithelial cells. Following this theory, their conclusion was the most obvious: ''\u2026patients \u2026treated with ACE2-increasing drugs are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection\u2026''. None of the quoted articles reporting the clinical experience in China has assessed the previous pharmacological therapy of the patients infected by COVID-19 [3, 4] .",

I am not excluding that it might be shown in the future, when the literature will have more clear and valid scientific information, but at the moment it seems very premature.
