The cytokine storm observed in a large population of critically ill patients with COVID-19 was associated with disease severity [13] . Some patients suffered from cytokine storm progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, which was eventually followed by multiple organ failure [14] . Therefore, early identification and timely intervention for the patients with cytokine storm is of crucial importance. At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2003, glucocorticoids were widely used in patients with cytokine storm. Corticosteroids exert an antiinflammatory effect and are indicated for the treatment of respiratory distress caused by cytokine storm, however, on the other hand, they exert an immunosupresor effect and constraint the ability of an individual's immune system to clear the virus [5] . What's more, long-term use or large doses of glucocorticoids is restricted by its adverse reaction of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head. These facts suggest that the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 is inconclusive. Glycyrrhizin, however, would feature a cytokine-modulating activity not as immunosupresant as that of the glucocorticoids down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines, but leaving or even enhancing functional the rest of the immune response [15] . Therefore, with fewer side effects, glycyrrhizin are expected to be used in the early stages of the disease and can be administrated for a longer time; this approach holds promise for preventing or attenuating excessive cytokines storms in patients with COVID-19.",

Glycyrrhizin, valued for its various pharmacology effects, may emerge as a promising agent for the treatment of COVID-19 ( Figure 1 ). More importantly, some derivatives of glycyrrhizin with a much higher anti-virus activity compared to glycyrrhizin itself [4] , might also be a good option. However, there are also some crucial points that should be considered. The side effects of glycyrrhizin must pay close attention especially in elderly people with heart disease and hypertension. And it is important to know that the biological function draw from in vitro findings and animal experiments may not correspond with clinical efficacy in humans, thus the exact clinical curative effect as well as the optimal dose and course of treatment must be further assessed.",

Actually, as a broad-spectrum antiviral, interferon would function to limit the virus spread by inhibiting the replication of both DNA and RNA viruses at different stages of their replicative cycles and activating immune cell populations to clear virus infections[23].",
