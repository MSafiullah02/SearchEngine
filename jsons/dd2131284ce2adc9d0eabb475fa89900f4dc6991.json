The disease burden from ARIs is substantial and thus their prevention and treatment are a priority for public health agencies. 1 Moreover, current data regarding patterns of unnecessary antimicrobial use in adult patients showed that ARIs are among most frequent indications for antimicrobial use. 2, 3 Children and older adults are the most vulnerable groups of the population, and ARIs are the most common cause of their hospitalization worldwide. 4, 5 Older adults are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to ARIs because of coexisting chronic diseases and immune senescence. 6 Although bacteria, fungi, and parasites can cause and human rhinovirus (HRV) strains. 7 Influenza is a well-recognized cause of ARIs in adults 8, 9 but substantial adult disease is also caused by other respiratory viruses, 10 particularly RSV and HMPV. [11] [12] [13] [14] Both viruses belong to the new family Pneumoviridae within order Mononegavirales, 15 and have similar clinical features. 16, 17 The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of ARIs in children caused by RSV and HMPV in Croatia are well described. [18] [19] [20] In contrast, for adult populations in Croatia, data are limited primarily on influenza viruses due to laboratory use of direct methods (isolation, antigen detection, or molecular methods) for routine diagnosis of respiratory viruses.",

The study not only demonstrates the frequency of viral infection in general but also highlights the burden of other respiratory viruses in addition to influenza in the Croatian population. Results of this study showed that the most common virus detected in older adults admitted to the hospital with symptoms of ARIs in Croatia is Flu types A and B which is consistent with many previously published studies.8,22 However, the detection rate of influenza in this study (51 of 182; 28%) is much higher than in previously mentioned studies originated from the United States and Europe (11.6% and 9%, respectively). These results emphasize the epidemic and unpredictable nature of influenza but also potential opportunities in a country with low influenza vaccine uptake. The second, and the third most commonly detected viruses are the pneumoviruses, namely RSV and HMPV with detection frequencies of 9.3% (17 of 182) and 8.8% (16 of 182). Many studies around the globe have illustrated the importance of RSV as a cause of serious respiratory illness affecting older adults.12,23,24 The high frequency of HMPV detection in adults, revealed in this study, is not as commonly reported when compared with the other studies.22,25 However, one recent study that performed multiple imputation estimations of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with detections of specific respiratory viruses among 2259 adults hospitalized with CAP has revealed HMPV and RSV as the second, and third causative agents after Flu with detection frequencies of 3.9% and 3%, respectively.26",

Since the epidemiology of viral infections may vary world-wide, local epidemiological data on viral ARIs will best inform public health authorities to develop efficient prevention measures and strategies. Also, these data could help to promote the introduction of molecular laboratory diagnostics for respiratory viruses in routine medical care procedure in Croatia by improving public and physician awareness of noninfluenza viral disease.

Recently developed multiplex-PCR methods enable testing for many pathogens in parallel in a single analysis, and are commercially available.33 Additionally, molecular techniques, especially molecular point of care tests, have enabled very fast detection (within few hours or even minutes) of respiratory viruses and can Unfortunately, these methods are still expensive which makes them difficult to implement in daily practice. The cost of using multiplex testing for routine care is currently a subject of debate.34,35 To be cost effective for routine care, testing should lead to change in management of patients. With exception of influenza where diagnosis leads to specific infection control measures and there is antiviral therapy currently available, the effect on patient management is less clear for the diagnosis other viruses. However, there are encouraging reports that if viral diagnosis is combined with proper clinical judgment and education, more rational use of antiviral drugs and antibiotics may result from the additional information.36 The use of serum biomarkers such as procalcitonin or CRP to assess likelihood of concomitant bacterial infection may be complementary to viral testing and enhance rational antibiotic prescription.37 An additional observation that complicates etiological diagnosis is that multiple viruses may cocirculate as observed in our study where RSV, HMPV, and PIV seasons overlapped with Flu A/B season (",
