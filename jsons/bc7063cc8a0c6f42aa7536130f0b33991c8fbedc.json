In this study, between 2007 and 2014 fecal samples were collected from 97 dogs and 83 cats with diarrhea and examined to determine the prevalence of NoV and SaV infections in Japan. To detect caliciviruses, approximately 300 bases targeting the polymerase gene were amplified using RT-PCR and subjected to phylogenetic and homology analyses. Specific PCR products were obtained from four canine and nine feline samples: two canine and one feline isolate were classified as NoV, two canine isolates as SaV and the remaining eight feline isolates as vesivirus (VeV). The three NoV isolates were classified into the same clade as that of known canine and feline NoVs; their homologies (75.9-92.3%) were higher than those with human genogroup IV (GIV) NoVs (59.1-65.9%). The homology of the feline NoV isolate with previously reported feline NoV isolates was particularly high (91.7-92.3%). Regarding SaV, the two canine isolates were classified into the same clade as known canine SaVs and their homologies (72.5-86.5%) were higher than those with other mammal SaVs (20.7-58.0%). The eight feline VeV isolates were assumed to be feline calicivirus. The present study is the first report of the presence of NoV-and SaV-infected dogs and cats in Japan. The findings suggest there are species-specific circulations of NoV and SaV among dogs and cats, in Japan.",

In addition, excluding the strains isolated from Chinese dogs (Ca/HKU_Ca035F and Ca/HKU_Ca026F) whose genogroups have not yet been identified (29) , the homologies of these three isolates with known CaNoV and FeNoV (75.9-92.3%) were higher than those with GIV HuNoV (59.1-65.9%), indicating that the present three isolates form a clade with known CaNoVs and FeNoVs that differs from that of HuNoVs in the phylogenetic tree. It has been suggested that NoV has been circulating among dogs (30) ; the findings of the present study support this, as described above. However, the homologies of the two NoV isolates with known CaNoVs ranged from 77.3 to 91.8% even within the same clade, suggesting the presence of several lineages within the CaNoV genogroups, as described previously (9, 10) . Although only a small number of FeNoV strains have been characterized, the homologies observed between the present feline NoV isolate (Fe/Saitama382/2013/JP) and previous cat-and lion-derived isolates (CU081210E and Pistoia1387) were extremely high (91.7-92.3%), suggesting the presence of a unique circulation of NoV in the Felidae that differs from that in dogs.",

CaNoV, FeNoV and CaSaV may have an infection cycle in each animal species or family. However, the potential for human infection by some types of NoV and SaV in dogs and cats cannot be ruled out, because of the following observations: (i) GII NoV, which is the most prevalent human NoV, has been detected from dogs (15); (ii) GIV and GVI NoVs, which are the main genogroups in dogs and cats, have been detected in humans (9, 11) ; and (iii) antibodies against GVI NoV have been detected in human sera (17) . Although a significantly high detection rate of CaNoV in dogs with diarrhea has previously been reported (11) , epidemiologic data have been insufficient and the pathogenic potential of NoV and SaV for dogs and cats remains undetermined. In the present study, we were unable to clarify the pathogenicity of NoVs and SaVs in dogs and cats, because mixed infections with CPV-2 or FPLV, which are the most virulent causes of diarrhea in dogs and cats, were noted in all five samples in which NoV or SaV was detected. In previous studies, most dogs infected with CaNoV were approximately 2-3 months old (13, 30) . A high CaNoV prevalence has been reported in kennels (31) . All four dogs in which NoV and SaV were detected in the present study were also 2 months old and purebred, suggesting that CaNoV and CaSaV infections likely also occur in environments where puppies and kittens are ordinarily kept, such as pet shops and breeding colonies.",

No other diarrheagenic viruses were detected in one FCV-positive sample (Fe/Tokyo671/2013/JP), and only FCoV-I, which generally causes no or mild symptoms of intestinal infections when it infects alone, was detected in three samples (Fe/Yamaguchi165/2011/ JP, Fe/Saitama1650/2013/JP and Fe/Osaka210/2013/JP).

FPLV was detected in one feline sample in which NoV had been detected (Fe/ Saitama382/2013/JP) and in four of the eight feline samples in which VeV had been detected.
