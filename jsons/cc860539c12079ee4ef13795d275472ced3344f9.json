            "text": "Driven by increasing demands of assisting users to dress and match clothing properly, fashion recommendation has attracted wide attention. Its core idea is to model the compatibility among fashion items by jointly projecting embedding into a unified space. However, modeling the item compatibility in such a category-agnostic manner could barely preserve intra-class variance, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel category-aware metric learning framework, which not only learns the cross-category compatibility notions but also preserves the intra-category diversity among items. Specifically, we define a category complementary relation representing a pair of category labels, e.g., tops-bottoms. Given a pair of item embeddings, we first project them to their corresponding relation space, then model the mutual relation of a pair of categories as a relation transition vector to capture compatibility amongst fashion items. We further derive a negative sampling strategy with non-trivial instances to enable the generation of expressive and discriminative item representations. Comprehensive experimental results conducted on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority and feasibility of our proposed approach.",

The major stream of existing approaches for fashion compatibility modeling adopts metric learning techniques to extract effective fashion item representations. A typical fashion compatibility modeling strategy is to learn a latent style space, where matching item pairs stay closer than incompatible pairs. The compatibility of two given fashion items is computed by the pairwise Euclidean distance or inner product between fashion item embeddings. Nevertheless, the previous work has two main limitations that lead to sub-optimal performance. Firstly, some approaches consider fashion compatibility modeling as a single-relational task. However, this neglects the fact that people usually focus on different aspects of clothes from different categories. For example, people are more likely to focus on color and material for blouses and pants, while they may pay attention to shape and style for jeans and shoes. Moreover, using a single unified space is likely to result in incorrect similarity transitivity in fashion compatibility. For instance, if item A matches both B and C, while B and C may not be compatible, the embeddings of A, B and C will be forced to be close to each other in a single unified space, which degrades prediction performance because the compatibility essentially does not hold transitivity property. Therefore, such a category-independent approach will result in inaccurate item representations. Secondly, most existing approaches merely randomly sample negative instances from the training set. However, most of the randomly sampled triplets are trivial ones, which may fail to support the model to learn discriminative item representations.",

However, there exists one issue in the above equation: in reality, items from a specific pair of categories share diverse fashion attributes such as material, style and pattern. Therefore, it is insufficient to preserve intra-category diversity by building only a single embedding vector for each category complementary relation. To address this issue, we propose to build multiple relation-specific subspaces, i.e., M r \u2208 R k\u00d7d , r \u2208 R, where k is the number of visual feature vector dimensions. Using such category-aware projection operations is twofold. Firstly, the relation-specific subspaces provide abundant trainable parameters to preserve intra-category diversity. Secondly, it also provides capability for handling unseen items through a projection operation. Thus, we define the projected item vectors of v i and v j as,",

This proves that considering category label information is of great importance in fashion compatibility modeling, which can be helpful to avoid incorrect compatibility similarity transitivity.

Although they build category-aware mask vectors to capture different fashion characteristics among different categories, it is still not sufficient to preserve the intra-category diversity among items. With the help of our relation-specific projection spaces, our model can capture much more specific information of compatibility from different categories. The improvements on PolyvoreMaryland dataset are even much better in terms of AUC and Hit@5. This is mainly because of the different number of relations in two datasets. We define 146 category relations in the Polyvore dataset, while there are only 30 relations in the FashionVC dataset.
