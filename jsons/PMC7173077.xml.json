Canonical biomarkers include the total white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). For over ten years there has been increasing interest in the use of procalcitonin as a biomarker for discrimination of bacterial from viral infection, and to assess response to antimicrobial therapy. Meta-analyses of clinical trials indicate that procalcitonin results can reduce antimicrobial usage and improve outcomes in respiratory tract infections with similar findings in critically ill patients with presumed bacterial sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU).2, 3, 4 However, procalcitonin measurement is currently expensive and is not universally available. In contrast, the full blood count is a cheap, fast and ubiquitous laboratory investigation. Automated counters provide a differential WCC, enumerating circulating leucocytes including neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes, but these parameters are usually interpreted in isolation.",

The ready availability and low cost of such indices would make them particularly helpful in low- and middle-income countries. In these settings, patient stratification to identify those requiring higher levels of care and discrimination of bacterial/non-bacterial infection to aid antimicrobial stewardship would be especially valuable.",

We included studies reporting the following data: diagnosis of infection (compared to healthy controls, non-infectious diagnosis or alternative infection); severity of infection (any measure) and outcome of infection (any measure). Due to possible confounding effects on the ratios, we excluded studies conducted exclusively in patients with active cancer, chronic liver disease (including HBV and HCV infection), HIV or immunosuppression.

Microbial aetiology and site of infection notwithstanding, there is significant variation in the host response to infection represented in the cohorts, with septic shock accounting for between 14% and 100% of cases. Furthermore, analysis strategies differ between studies with the use of quintiles in one study compared to continuous variables in the others. Quintiles allow better differentiation of outlier values from normal and thus may be more discriminatory. It is interesting that amongst patients with sepsis, of whom 54% were diagnosed with septic shock,13 a high NLR was associated with mortality whereas in a cohort composed only of patients with septic shock the reverse was observed.16 Previous work has demonstrated more lymphocyte apoptosis in patients with septic shock compared to sepsis without shock, and this lymphocyte depletion was associated with poorer outcomes.9 Whilst this paradigm is consistent with some of the observations that have been reported, an apparent paradox exists where some studies report the converse.13, 16 Neutrophil depletion is one possible contributing factor but this warrants further investigation and highlights the importance of high-throughput clinical phenotyping.1 Sepsis syndrome includes a wide range of infectious aetiologies and heterogeneous host responses. Given the evidence we report here, and the ubiquity of full blood count data, it is likely that NLR will be a more informative parameter (compared to total WCC, neutrophil count and CRP) to include in future stratification models to identify sepsis endotypes.1\n",

Results from studies in critically ill adults with sepsis suggests a signal towards outcome may exist, but more sophisticated patient stratification and data analysis will be required to determine any utility in identifying sepsis endotypes. Longitudinal measurement during the course of infection could be informative but this hypothesis requires testing. The ability to identify influenza virus infection in patients with respiratory tract infection using LMR is potentially useful if validated, and more generally the investigation of these ratios in the discrimination of bacterial/viral/parasitic aetiologies would be valuable. Future work should focus on patient cohorts in need of new biomarkers and avoid comparisons of infected and healthy individuals.
