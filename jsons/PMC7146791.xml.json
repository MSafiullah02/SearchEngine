Since then, additional cases have been reported in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Clinical presentation and pathology in FRSCV disease closely resemble that in the noneffusive (dry) form of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in domestic cats, which is caused by a group 1 feline coronavirus (FCoV).",

Physical examination may identify intra-abdominal masses, renomegaly, and splenomegaly. Signs of central nervous system involvement include acute or progressive hind limb paresis, ataxia, seizures opisthotonus, abnormal gait, and proprioceptive deficits. Frequently noted hematologic changes include nonregenerative anemia, elevated globulins, decreased albumin, and thrombocytopenia. Urinalysis abnormalities may include green urine, proteinuria, blood, and rare bilirubin crystals. Significant radiographic signs in ferrets with FRSCV include loss of lumbar musculature, decreased peritoneal detail, presence of mid-abdominal soft tissue masses, and splenomegaly. The majority of ferret cases with systemic coronavirus disease were noted to have ultrasonographic evidence of peritonitis, abdominal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, abdominal soft tissue masses, renomegaly, and changes in the renal cortex echogenicity.",

Nodules can also be found on the surface or extending into the parenchyma of other organs, especially the liver, kidneys, spleen, and lung.

Histopathologic lesions are characterized by widespread pyogranulomatous perivasculitis and peritonitis nearly identical to the noneffusive form of FIP. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-FCoV monoclonal antibody provides a definitive diagnosis by identifying positive staining for group 1 coronavirus antigen in foci of pyogranulomatous inflammation from ferrets with suspected coronavirus disease. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays have been developed and have the potential to differentiate genotypes of ferret coronavirus.",

Upon physical examination, a 2-mm-diameter focal area of opacity was noted in the left cornea. In addition, the ferret was quiet, in poor body condition, and dehydrated. A complete blood count and plasma biochemistry revealed a severe nonregenerative anemia, azotemia, hyperproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and mild hyperphosphatemia and hyperchloremia. Urinalysis revealed hyposthenuria. Whole body radiographs showed multifocal thoracic nodular disease, splenomegaly, and renomegaly. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed bilaterally enlarged kidneys, hypoechoic liver and spleen, and a caudal abdominal hypoechoic mobile nodule.",

The presence of coronavirus in the left eye was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry.
