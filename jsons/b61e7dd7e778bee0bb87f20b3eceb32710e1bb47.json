This factor is relevant because it increases the risk of long-term social isolation after discharge and may increase the risk of suicide [4] . Appropriate mental support for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection after discharge as well as during hospitalization is necessary. In addition, further studies to explore human-to-human transmission and treatment options are needed to prevent further outbreaks and to reduce patients' fear of transmitting the virus to their loved ones.",
