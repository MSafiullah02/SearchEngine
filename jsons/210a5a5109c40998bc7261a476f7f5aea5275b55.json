Lukyanov, 2013 , published in Biokhimiya, 2013 in quaternary structures. Even lectins of shellfish and echinoderms demonstrate wide heterogeneity, being mul timeric as well as monomeric and dimeric proteins. Lectins of arthropods -organisms with active modus vivendi, are multimers with molecular mass 450 kDa and higher. Comparative analysis of plant lectins demon strates an analogous tendency: unlike lectins of terrestrial plants, which have subunit structure and specificity to mono and oligosaccharides, lectins of an older group of plants -marine algae, have the lower molecular masses, are usually monomeric, and do not exhibit affinity to monosaccharide residues. It is interesting that analogous ly to lectins of higher plants and vertebrates, lectins of invertebrates have higher affinity to \u03b2 anomeric forms of carbohydrates than to \u03b1 anomeric forms [5] .",

Study of lectins from mollusks is of significant interest because of data on their antitu mor, antiviral, and antimicrobial activity [19 21 ]. However, among lectins of Mollusca phylum, those iso lated from species having economic or medical value such as mussels or oysters are of maximal interest [22] . Most lectins that are either associated or not associated with cell membrane of hemocytes and often perform protec tive function in animals have been isolated from hemolymph of clams [23, 24] . Lectins have also been detected in plasma and various organs and tissues: diges tive gland, gonads, and soft tissues. Lectins from plasma are usually multimeric protein complexes with several sites for binding to ligands [25] . Lectins of clams are spe cific to various carbohydrates. Specificity to Gal, GalNAc, Glc, Lac, Fuc, and also to sialic acids and gly coproteins of mucin type is typical of lectins of these marine invertebrates. Such wide range of specificities of lectins of the Bivalvia family can be due to the presence of multiple isoforms of lectins specific for a particular monosaccharide or a group of monosaccharides with similar structures. For example, a heterogeneous sialo specific lectin composed of three isolectins has been found in hemolymph of the mussel Modiolus modiolus. Two of these lectins, modiolin H and modiolin E, agglu tinate human and horse erythrocytes, respectively, but only for modiolin E Ca 2+ is required for manifestation of activity [26] . Different subunits seem to be capable of binding to several monosaccharides with different affini ty. Such organization can extend the range of ligands bound by them. Moreover, lectins of clams consisting of identical subunits are able to react with various monosac charides. Lectin of the oyster Pinctada fucata is an exam ple; with maximal efficiency it binds to Gal, and it also exhibits specificity to other carbohydrates (Glc, Man, Fuc, GalN, GalNAc, ManNAc, NeuNAc) and aggluti nates various kinds of erythrocytes [27] . Lectins isolated from the clams Tegillarca granosa and Ostrea chilensis also demonstrate multispecificity [28, 29] .",

The amino acid sequence of the secretory lectin MeML was determined by molecular biological methods; this lectin is expressed by mucocytes embedding epitheli um of the mantle complex of organs and intestine and has not been detected in other tissues including hemocytes [56] . It is interesting to note that although lectins of M. edulis have been isolated from various organs and tissues and differ in specificity, in all cases Ca 2+ is required for their activity. A new multigenic family of proteins con taining a fibrinogen like domain was recently discovered in clams belonging to the Mytilus genus [57] . Two such lectins, named MytFREP1 and MytFREP2, were cloned from hemocytes of M. edulis.",

Works in this direction by Chinese investigators have been especially fruitful: they not only have determined the structures of new lectins, but also revealed their function al roles in mollusks. For example, recombinant lectin rAiCTL5 obtained after cloning of a new lectin from the scallop Argopecten irradians agglutinates gram negative bacteria, interacting with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [58] . The F type lectin (PmF lectin) has been cloned from the oyster Pinctada martensii. RT PCR and qRT PCR analy sis has revealed a significantly increased level of expres sion of mRNA lectin as a response to invasion by the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus; this indicates that PmF lectin participates in protective reactions of the animal [59] .",

Hemocytes are responsible for synthesis of lectins of hemolymph or at least are the main place of their synthe sis, since lectins initially have been membrane receptors of hemocytes [62] . A large number of lectins binding to a wide variety of carbohydrates including \u03b11 6Gal, \u03b21 4Gal, GalNAc, GlcNAc, ManN, Fuc, lactose, meli biose, raffinose, mannans, sialoconjugates, and bacterial LPS have been isolated from ascidians [63, 64] . Many researchers rationalize the wide variety of ligand speci ficities of lectins of hemolymph by the fact that lectins of ascidians have protective function in the animals, and for manifestation of this function molecular forms (structur al classes and isoforms) should be variable [64] . Protective function also results in a wide variety in molecular mass es of lectins of ascidians. High molecular weight lectins with masses 90 600 kDa in the native state have been iso lated from the ascidians Clavelina picta, Styela plicata, Botrylloides leachii, and Halocynthia roretzi [64 69 ]. Low molecular weight lectins with masses 14 69 73] . Both high and low molecular mass lectins are main ly subunit proteins [ 65 69, 73] , although monomers are also described [64, 65, 71, 73] .

In the case of collectins, the CRD is specific for Glc/Man or Gal derivatives, and ficollins have a fibrinogen like domain at the C end; this domain can interact with various carbohydrates, most often with GlcNAc. Thus, two Gal specific metal dependent lectins with molecular masses 43 and 90 kDa have been isolated from the ascidian S. plicata and characterized. Determination of amino acid content and amino acid sequence shows that these lectins are similar to collectins of higher animals [65] . Similar lectins have been isolated also from other ascidians. The ascidian H. roretzi closely related to S. plicata has four ficollin like genes encoding fibrinogen like domains and a collagen like sequence [77] . A number of genes similar to genes of ficollins and collectins have been found in the genome of the ascidian C. intestinalis [78] .

Both are Ca 2+ independent, have rather low molecular mass (9 and 14 kDa, respectively), but DTL in the native state exists as a trimeric structure, while DTL A forms high molecular weight aggregates. Beside this, DTL and DTL A have different N terminal amino acid sequences and differ in binding to erythro cytes. DTL A agglutinates both trypsinized and non trypsinized erythrocytes, while DTL only trypsinized ones. In contrast to all other known GlcNAc specific lectins, DTL has a less extended carbohydrate binding site. The hydroxyl groups at C 3 and C 4 and also the acetamide group of GlcNAc participate in binding. Similar results were obtained for DCL I from the ascidi an D. candidum. This lectin also has a small CRD that interacts only with the hydroxyl groups at C 2, C 3, and C 4 of Gal residues. In contrast to DTL, DTL A binds not only to GlcNAc, but also to GalNAc, BSM, asialo BSM, heparin, and dextran sulfate. DTL A binding to structurally different ligands suggests multispecificity of this lectin. The data on inhibition of DTL A binding to BSM and heparin indicate that this lectin probably con tains two independent sites: GlcNAc/GalNAc binding site and an additional one responsible for interaction with heparin and dextran sulfate. A number of heparin bind ing lectins have been isolated from higher animals, including humans, whereas only several such lectins have been found in marine invertebrates [82, 83] , and only one similar lectin has been isolated from ascidians [83] . In contrast to DTL A, this lectin has only one binding site for heparin, chondroitin sulfate, and LPS.",

Treatment of erythrocytes by trypsin resulted in their enhanced agglutination by lectins [6, 89, 91 95] . Most lectins are active in the pH range 6.0 9.0, and the pres ence of bivalent metal cations is not required [6, 86 89, 91] , although metal dependent lectins are also found, e.g. a thermally stable lectin from the coelomic liquid of Sipunculus nudus [95] . Molecular masses of the isolated lectins vary within the range 12 36 kDa, some of the lectins are monomers [89, 92, 93] , and in several cases they appear to be dimeric or even tetrameric proteins; this suggests the presence of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in the lectin molecule [6, 91, 95] . The destruc tion of oligomeric structure by addition of \u03b2 mercap toethanol can result in complete loss of hemagglutinating activity, as shown for the lectin from the coelomic liquid of S. nudus [95] .

Moreover, CGL and TCL decrease overexpression of TNF \u03b1 and IL 6 on stimulation of cells by LPS, thus exhibiting immunomodulating properties [133] . MTL, a lectin from a mussel, also stimulates the induced and spontaneous production of anti inflammatory cytokines TNF \u03b1 and IFN \u03b3. In a case of induction of cells by LPS, we observed some decrease in the level of anti inflamma tory cytokine IL 4, especially at low concentration of lectin; this indicates that lectin exhibits immunomodulat ing activity [50] . In the last six years several papers on cytokine like molecules of invertebrates, comparative immunology, and evolution of cytokines have been pub lished. In these papers the terms \"putative cytokine\", \"cytokine like\", etc. have been used for the first time [136] .

Some lectins therewith selectively affect only T or B lymphocytes, while others stimulate prolif eration of both groups of lymphocytes. The produced effect depends on concentrations used, valence, and/or molecule dimensions [137] . Lectin often causes a cyto toxic effect on lymphocytes on increasing above the opti mal concentration. Several new lectins exhibiting mito genic activity have been isolated from marine hydrobionts during the last 20 years.

In contrast to the antiviral preparations used in medi cine, aimed at suppression of the life cycle of HIV, lectins prevent penetration and further propagation of virus, binding to carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins of its envelope and blocking association of virion with receptor on cell membrane. In this case the highly mannose con taining N bound oligosaccharide chains act as ligands for the lectin [142 144] . A lectin exhibiting affinity to Glc, Man, and GlcNAc and a high anti HIV activity was iso lated from the red alga Griffithsia spp. in 2005 [145] . Further studies have demonstrated that this lectin, named griffithsin, is active against atypical pneumonia and other pathogenic coronaviruses [146] , hepatitis C virus [147] , and Japanese encephalitis virus [148] . This lectin does not exhibit mitogenic activity towards human mononu clear cells and does not affect production levels of the main cytokines [149, 150] , so why further development of antiviral preparations based on griffithsin is perspective. Lectin KAA 2 exhibiting antiviral activity against a wide variety of influenza strains including swine influenza virus H1N1 has been isolated from another red alga, Kappaphycus alvarezii [151] . Lectin BCA isolated from the green alga Boodlea coacta is also active against influenza viruses of A and B types and HIV [152] .",
