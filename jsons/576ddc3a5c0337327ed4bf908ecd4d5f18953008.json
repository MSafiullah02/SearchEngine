(This paper does not refer to immunocompromised patients; maybe Greene 2007 [ 52 ] or Cornely 2010 [ 58 ] could be used), a potential negative impact of delayed diagnosis (i.e., more advanced infection) on future antineoplastic treatment, and high costs of prolonged hospitalization. This has to be compared with the costs of a non-enhanced CT scan, which is around \u20ac 230 in German hospitals. After physical examination and interpretation of laboratory fi ndings, the search for an infectious focus starts with the identification of the most suspected organ system(s). The appropriate imaging technique has to be selected demanding for high sensitivity and clinically meaningful negative predictive value [ 4 ] . Exact proportions of organ involvement are diffi cult to determine and may differ from clinical and pathological fi ndings, the latter often obtained from autopsies (i.e., negative selection). Clinically, lungs are affected in 30 % of febrile neutropenic patients and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aSCT) recipients, paranasal sinuses in 3 % of neutropenic patients, and 30 % in the aSCT setting (concomitant to pneumonia), while the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, central nervous system, and kidneys are less frequently involved [ 4 ] .",

CXR has several advantages: it is quick, widely available (even on the ward), inexpensive, and associated with a low radiation dose. CXR is occasionally done on the ward to keep neutropenic patients in protective isolation, even if performed in supine position. But CXR has the crucial disadvantage of superimposition and therefore a very limited sensitivity for the detection of pneumonia (Figs. 7.2 and 7.6 ) [ 14 , 16 ] . Especially if performed in supine position, lung infl ation is worse and lateral projection is lacking, which limits image quality besides other technical issues. In patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) after SCT, digital CXR in supine position achieves a sensitivity for early detection of pneumonia of only 46 % [ 17 ] . While CXR provides relevant clinical information concerning central venous catheters (CVC), pleural effusion, and pulmonary congestion [ 17 ] , it fails to enable early detection or exclusion of pneumonia, which is a major task in immunocompromised hosts. CXR in supine position alone is therefore not recommended for the early detection of pneumonia in these patients [ 5 ] . Also, if an infi ltrate is apparent at CXR, the options for its characterization are very limited. If pneumonia is considered in these hosts, thin-section CT should be preferred at any time [ 18 ] .",

To keep it simple, HRCT is an incremental scanning technique with several respiratory breath-holds resulting in inaccuracy of repositioning of the anatomical lung position. The use of 1 mm sections and gaps in between (e.g., 10 mm) results in representative, detailed images of selected lung areas; however, the noncontiguous scanning has its limitations in nodule detection, quantifi cation, and monitoring. Volumetric techniques as used in spiral CT and MSCT, acquired without gaps, are frequently reconstructed with larger thickness (e.g., 5 mm) resulting in spatial volume effects. This results in limitations to detect infl ammatory lung disease, especially ground-glass opacifi cation [ 22 ] . Since no additional information is expected from supplemental spiral CT to HRCT, as shown in AIDS patients [ 23 ] , HRCT may be used as a diagnostic standard. In contrast, thin-section MSCT provides volumetric scanning as well as detailed images [ 24 , 25 ] . This technique also allows for an adequate monitoring of lung disease since the same anatomical position can be reidentifi ed in baseline and follow-up studies [ 24 -26 ] . While a rapid technical development in CT imaging is ongoing, the different techniques applied today are addressed as \"CT\" in this chapter.",

Thus, CT yields very useful results with good sensitivity (87 %) and negative predictive value (88 %). The early use of HRCT achieves a gain of approximately 5 days during which pneumonia may be excluded [ 17 ] .
