Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) and the neurofilament light chain (NfL) are nowadays considered as the most promising candidate biomarkers for MND [14]. Both pNfH and NfL have been extensively studied across the neurological disorders and are considered to be reliable markers of acute and chronic neuronal injury [15]. The diagnostic role of neurofilaments has already been extensively explored. Previous studies provided evidence of a better diagnostic performance and higher sensitivity and specificity of pNfH when tested in the CSF compared to serum; however, a strong correlation between serum and CSF concentration has been reported [9, 16, 17]. Furthermore, pNfH correlated with disease severity and survival parameters but no studies have so far investigated serum pNfH as an independent predictor of survival [10, 17\u201320]. On the contrary, NfLs were demonstrated as independent predictors of survival in both CSF and serum [18, 21, 22]. Currently no biochemical prognostic biomarkers for assessing neuronal damage and disease progression across MND phenotypes are been explored. There is, however, an urgent need for a biochemical prognostic biomarker for MND to facilitate the estimation of the progression rate, survival, and patient\u2019s stratification [8, 23]. Definition of subtypes of MND is required to predict disease course and to correlate the phenotypes to the serum pNfH as a disease marker.",

A further neuropsychological evaluation as recommended by the Diagnostic Criteria for the Behavioural Variant of Frontotemporal Dementia and the ALS-FTD Consensus Criteria was performed [29, 30]. MND patients were grouped in agreement with the ALS-FTD Consensus Criteria into five categories: frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (ALS-FTD); behavioral impairment (ALS-bi); cognitive impairment (ALS-ci); combined cognitive and behavioral impairment (ALS-cbi), which includes patients who fulfill criteria for both ALS-ci and ALS-bi; normal neuropsychological evaluation (ALS-motor). Only patients who underwent neuropsychological testing after publication of the ALS-FTD Consensus Criteria were considered [5].",

            "text": "Indeed, pyramidal, bulbar, and classic phenotypes exhibited higher pNfH levels compared to MND patients with a selective LMN or UMN involvement. The positive correlation between pNfH and the progression rate suggests that a faster degeneration of the motor system is one of the determinants of serum pNfH concentration, explaining the lower levels detected in slow progressive phenotypes as PUMN, PLMN, and FA. We found an inverse correlation between pNfH and MEP/cMAP suggesting that an elevated UMN burden might influence the serum pNfH concentration. Although the explanation is probably more complex, our results suggest that a rapid ongoing degeneration process of the UMN/corticospinal tract might be related to an increase of the serum pNfH concentration. However, MEP/cMAP does not selectively estimate UMN impairment and it might be influenced by both central and peripheral motor conductions; therefore, experimental neurophysiological methods such as short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) or advanced MRI investigations are needed to confirm this correlation. Consistent with this hypothesis, previous studies reported that serum NfL levels were higher in ALS patients with a widespread UMN involvement and correlated with MRI measures of corticospinal tract degeneration, while NfL were lower in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) patients [18, 35]. Notably, we observed significantly higher serum pNfH levels in C9orf72 MND patients compared to non-C9orf72 MND, in line with a previous study, which detected higher CSF pNfH levels in C9orf72 MND carriers [33]. C9orf72 MND has a faster disease progression rate and shorter survival [6], reflecting a widespread CNS neurodegeneration and more severe brain atrophy even involving extra motor areas compared to non- C9orf72 MND [34]. We investigated serum pNfH levels among the cognitive phenotypes, classified according to the Strong criteria [30]. Although MND patients with a concurrence of cognitive dysfunction and/or FTD showed higher median pNfH levels compared to MND patients with normal cognition and behavior, this difference did not reach a statistical significance, suggesting that extra-motor areas involvement may not be a major determinant of the serum pNfH concentration in MND patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm our result. In support of our data, a previous study has shown higher CSF pNfH levels in ALS-FTD compared with FTD patients without evidence of motor system involvement, suggesting that the motor system involvement is the major determinant of pNfH concentrations [33].",

            "text": "While serum and CSF pNfH concentrations were previously correlated with survival parameters in univariate analysis, our study showed that serum pNfH concentration is a negative independent prognostic factor for survival through an accurate multivariate analysis [19]. Indeed, patients with higher pNfH concentration showed a significantly shorter median survival. Serum pNfH concentration showed the highest hazard ratio compared to all the other factors influencing survival included in the Cox multivariate model. Additionally, we showed that serum pNfH concentration was also significant as independent negative factor to predict the time to reach King\u2019s stage 4, i.e., the time to reach feeding or respiratory failure, which requires specific clinical interventions. Patients in King\u2019s stages 3 and 4 showed higher serum pNfH concentration compared to patients in King\u2019s stages 1 and 2. These findings suggest that pNfH levels in serum indicate the spreading and the global rate of CNS involvement and may offer a quick and simple measure to assess and predict neuronal damage in MND. Our results extend the previous findings that both neurofilament subunits and other wet biomarkers should be thoroughly assessed to be included in future prognostic models [18, 22, 36].",

            "text": "A partial limitation to the current study is that our results concerning serum pNfH were not replicable in the CSF due to the lack of serum and CSF paired matched samples in our cohort. Although previous works showed higher sensitivity and specificity of pNfH in the CSF when tested for a diagnostic purpose, a strong correlation between serum and CSF pNfH has also been demonstrated in MND patients [16, 19, 37, 38]. However, we aimed to assess the prognostic rather than the diagnostic role of serum pNfH. Furthermore, a prognostic blood-based biomarker would be preferable to a CSF biomarker to avoid an invasive practice such as the lumbar puncture. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that further independent confirmatory investigations are required to confirm our findings and to better define prognostic reference values. Furthermore, longitudinal studies will be essential to determine whether the pNfH levels increase, decrease or stay stable over time. Unfortunately, we are currently unable to raise additional experiments in the laboratory due to the lockdown related to the COVID-19 in Italy. Future studies will be essential to assess the variance of measurement of pNfH over the disease course.",
