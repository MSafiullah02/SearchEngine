Researchers rapidly isolated a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also referred to as COVID-19) from confirmed infected pneumonia patients [1] . Attracting great attention nationally and worldwide, confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). As of 13 April 2020, confirmed cases of COVID-19 had exceeded 1,800,000 cases and 117,000 fatalities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared COVID-19 as both a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern.",

Furthermore, DH interventions enable healthcare providers to fight the global pandemic, even if they are practicing self-isolation measures or working remotely. Both Aiva [45] and Deloitte assistant [46] have created an AI-enabled patient communication solution that allows patients to request assistance, via Amazon Alexa or Google Home, without the need to press the traditional call bell button.
