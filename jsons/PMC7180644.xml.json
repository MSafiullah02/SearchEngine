We recommend that poor oral hygiene be considered a risk to COVID-19 complications, particularly in patients predisposed to altered biofilms due to diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Bacteria present in patients with severe COVID-19 are associated with the oral cavity, and improved oral hygiene may reduce the risk of complications. Whilst COVID-19 has a viral origin, it is suspected that in severe forms of the infection, bacteria plays a part, increasing the chance of complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.1",

Whilst 80% of patients with COVID-19 infections have mild symptoms, 20% progress to have a severe form of infection associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers (Interleukin 2, 6, 10) and bacteria.2,3 They also exhibit a remarkably higher neutrophil count and lower lymphocyte count than in mild patients.4 A high neutrophil count is abnormal for a viral infection, but common for a bacterial infection, suggesting that in severe cases of COVID-19, bacterial superinfection is common.",

Periodontopathic bacteria are implicated in systemic inflammation, bacteraemia, and pneumonia.6 Bacteria present in the metagenome of patients severely infected with COVID-19 included high reads for Prevotella, Staphylococcus, and Fusobacterium, all usually commensal organisms of the mouth.7 Over 80% of patients in ICU exhibited an exceptionally high bacterial load,3 and treatment has been successful with a dual regime of an antiviral and an antibiotic.8 It is clear that bacterial superinfections are common in patients suffering from a severe case of COVID-19.",
