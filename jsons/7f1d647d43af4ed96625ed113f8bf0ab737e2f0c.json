Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), together with the genetically related coronaviruses of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), is a group 3 coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus being tentatively in group 4, the other known mammalian coronaviruses being in groups 1 and 2. IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract * /the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca, usually without clinical effects. The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay. Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase. Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds. Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age. In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus. Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks may not respond with a protective immune response. Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains. IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor. Consequently, chickens may be revaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later. Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of B/50% of chickens. Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others. In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations. This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny. The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S. The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody. Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low ( B/50%) for commercial application. Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments. Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection. Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody.

Indeed, the proteins of SARS coronavirus had such low amino acid identity with those of known coronaviruses that it has been tentatively assigned to a new coronavirus group 4. The three existing coronavirus groups (Table 1) were initially devised on the basis of a lack of antigenic relationships between the species of different groups (Pedersen et al., 1978; S\u00e1nchez et al., 1990; Enjuanes et al., 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2003) . It is probable that the vast majority of the human population is susceptible to SARS coronavirus. The SARS epidemic was contained at 'only' 8460 cases by the enormous effort, and sacrifice, of a large number of individuals associated with many public authorities. So severe were the infections, in a fully susceptible population, that 808 died; doubtless a greater proportion would have died had it not been for the medical attention focussed upon them.

Also, in three experiments one of each group of 10 birds initially inoculated with the UK/6/82 virus was clearly not protected against homologous challenge. The chickens had been individually inoculated with a high dose (5 to 6 log 10 infectious virus) of the primary inoculum.

It not only depends on the antigenic relatedness of the primary infecting strain and a subsequent challenge strain, but also on the response of individual chickens; approximately 10% of chickens in some experiments failed to develop a protective immune response. Furthermore, while breeds of chicken are similar in that they are all efficiently infected by IBV, resulting in similar titres of virus, they differ in their capacity to clear the infection (Otsuki et al., 1990) . Small ( \u00c2/ 5%) differences in S1 amino acids would appear to be sometimes responsible for poor cross-protection. It should be borne in mind that while the focus has been on the relatedness of the S1 protein, other viral proteins may have a role in protective immunity; for example, the nucleocapsid protein, of which more later. Recently, we (T. Hodgson, R. Casais, B. Dove, P. Britton & D. Cavanagh, manuscript in preparation) have substituted (swapped) the spike protein gene of our Beaudette infectious clone (receiver strain) with that of the M41 strain (donor strain). Both strains are of the Massachusetts serotype and have 95.0% S1 amino acid identity. The Beaudette and M41 strains are attenuated and pathogenic for chickens, respectively. When chickens were inoculated with the donor, receiver or spike-swapped recombinant IBV and challenged with M41, the receiver strain induced almost no tracheal protection (assessed by ciliary activity) while the recombinant IBV induced protection almost as good as the donor strain. This was not due to an increased virulence of the receiver strain, as the spike-swapped recombinant was as non-pathogenic as the Beaudette receiver strain, and both replicated poorly. As the receiver strain and recombinant virus had identical proteins except for the spike protein, it would appear that the poor immunity induced by the receiver strain against the donor strain was due to some of the 5.0% of amino acid differences (27 different residues) in S1.
