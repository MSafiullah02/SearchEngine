Further, it is observed that these strains of viruses have a lower reproduction factor in tropical countries, outside the rain season. It is observed that possible inhibiting environmental factors in these epidemics are UV light (Schuit et al., 2020), temperature and humidity (Chong et al., 2020) and behavioral changes during the seasons (Gozzi et al., 2020). None of these environmental factors seems to be completely satisfactory to explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, which is very important to understand in the light of ongoing modelling efforts for the current Covid-19 pandemic.",

Further, it is good to understand better the interaction between aerosol pollen and flu-like viruses, and whether general immune responses are indeed a causal factor in reducing the spread of flu-like viruses. Finally, it still needs to be observed whether the covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) spread will be seasonal \u2013 \u201cgoing away in May\u201d \u2013 whereby the pollen factor could be studied as a directly or indirectly inhibiting factor, potentially.",
