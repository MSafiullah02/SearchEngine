Similarly to our study, they found rare detections (<1%) of influenza, RSV, and hMPV among asymptomatic controls and significantly higher detection in patients with CAP. In contrast to the relatively low prevalence of CoV among adults with CAP in our study (3.1%), CoVs were the most frequently detected viruses among patients with CAP in the study by Lieberman et al [1] (13.1%) and were significantly more common in patients with CAP than in asymptomatic controls. Differences in geography and season may account some of these differences.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 43, "end": 46, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 523, "end": 526, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The low prevalence of hRV detection from upper respiratory specimens among asymptomatic adults in our study (0.8%) is consistent with prior work, including that by Lieberman et al [1] , who detected hRV in 2% of 450 asymptomatic adults in Israel, and Jennings et al [39] , who detected hRV in 2% of 50 asymptomatic adults in New Zealand. Furthermore, Karhu et al [40] recently detected hRV from lower respiratory specimens (tracheal and bronchial aspirates) in 20% of 49 intubated adults with severe CAP in Finland. Combined, these findings of rare hRV detection in upper respiratory specimens of asymptomatic adults and detection of hRV in lower respiratory specimens of intubated adults with CAP suggest that when hRV is detected from upper respiratory swab samples in adults with CAP, it may have an etiologic role. A higher prevalence of asymptomatic hRV detection in children makes it more difficult to interpret a positive rRT-PCR test for hRV from an upper respiratory specimen in children than adults. Further study in children comparing detection of hRV in the upper and lower respiratory tracts would be helpful.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 183, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 266, "end": 270, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 363, "end": 367, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study had both strengths and limitations. Strengths include concurrent enrollment of asymptomatic controls and acutely ill patients with CAP in the same geographic regions and time periods and using identical rRT-PCR methods for viral detection. Age stratification and multivariable regression adjustment were used to account for potential confounders. Furthermore, results were presented as AFs, which helps with clinical interpretation. Limitations include pediatric enrollment during only 1 full respiratory season and adult enrollment at only 1 site and for 8 months owing to resource constraints. Inclusion of only 1 respiratory season prevented exploration of how seasonal variation in viral circulation may have affected AFs from year to year. Small numbers of viral detections in adult controls prevented further age stratification. In addition, asymptomatic controls were enrolled as a convenience sample and were not matched with case patients. Although some studies have reported persistent viral detections weeks after acute exacerbations of certain comorbid conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma [41] , matching controls to patients with CAP according to the presence of comorbid medical conditions and timing of related exacerbations was found to be impractical and would have severely hampered our enrollment efforts. Although 13% of enrolled subjects were excluded because we could not contact them to ascertain whether they developed respiratory symptoms after enrollment, those excluded were similar to subjects with completed follow-up (Supplementary Table 1 ). Enrollment of community controls who did not present to a healthcare facility would have provided another comparison group [16] but was not logistically feasible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1144, "end": 1148, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1743, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1605, "end": 1612, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, many respiratory viruses detected by rRT-PCR in patients with CAP were also detected in asymptomatic persons from the same time periods and geographic locations. Therefore, it is essential to consider background rates of asymptomatic viral detection when assessing the etiologic contribution of viruses to CAP, especially in children, who had more asymptomatic detections than adults. In our study, influenza, RSV, and hMPV were very rarely detected in asymptomatic persons of all ages compared with patients with CAP, suggesting that when they are detected in patients with CAP, these viruses were associated with disease.
