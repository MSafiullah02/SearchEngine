While addressing several concrete examples, particularly the role of digital communications in promoting extremist agendas, as recent events concerning Trumpism, Brexit, the alt-right, and 'fake news' have shattered myths regarding their positive and empowering qualities, the focus of this article is more on general claims than particular findings. Accordingly, rather than a final, definitive statement, it presents developmental suggestions and a heuristic that can, and should, be subjected to further scrutiny and debate. In the end, such preliminary efforts are significant as 'before we can pose questions of explanation, we must be aware of the character of the phenomenon we wish to explain' (Smelser, 1963: 5) .",

In many respects, Cohen and his contemporaries (Cohen and Young, 1973; Hall et al., 1978; Pearson, 1983) were the first to articulate the essential role of news-making in constructing social problems. Beyond generating surplus visibility and making otherwise marginal behaviours appear pernicious and pervasive, the media represent an independent voice . By delineating moral boundaries and circulating dire predictions about monstrous others, the histrionic tenor of reporting sensitizes audiences, culminating in hardened sentiment and unbridled punitiveness (Wright, 2015) . Moreover, coverage translates 'stereotypes into actuality', elevating the actual and perceived severity of deviance (Young, 1971: 11) . Here, identifying affronts to moral order triggers virulent hostility, further marginalizing folk devils and amplifying their deviant attachments and identities. As a control culture is institutionalized, surveillance and intervention intensify, exposing additional deviance, confirming popular stereotypes and justifying further crackdowns (Garland, 2008) .",

A particularly influential critique in these regards comes from McRobbie and Thornton (1995) . For them (1995: 560), Cohen's emphasis on mass-broadcasting and its social and institutional correlates -a univocal press, hierarchical information flows, monolithic audiences -is untenable in the context of 'multi-mediated social worlds'. 1 Specifically, it is held that the proliferation of media sources encourages exposure to alternative, if not dissenting, claims and reactions, ensuring that 'hard and fast boundaries between 'normal' and 'deviant' are less common' (McRobbie and Thornton, 1995; 572-3; cf. Tiffen, 2019) . Moreover, expanded access to media technologies -portable camcorders, personal computers, editing software and so one -broadens the remit of expression, giving rise to media sources inflected with the interests of marginalized groups (Coleman and Ross, 2010) . Able to 'produce their own media' and defended by 'niche and micromedia' (McRobbie and Thornton, 1995: 568) , folk devils are no longer powerless victims and can 'fight back' (McRobbie, 1994; cf. deYoung, 2013; Thornton, 1995) . Consequently, deviant outsiders and their supporters display greater capacity to contest and short-circuit panicked reactions, outcomes that render the success of moral crusades 'much less certain' (McRobbie and Thornton, 1995: 573) .",

With the onset of the 21st century, digital platforms not only underpin but also constitute social life in affluent societies, with individuals' identities and relations at least partly cultivated through computing infrastructures (Lupton, 2018) . Among the most significant manifestations of 'digital societies' are social media. Whether as social networking (Facebook), micro-blogging (Twitter), or photo -(Instagram) and video-sharing (YouTube) sites, social media have profoundly reconfigured the production and exchange of information. As 'many-to-many' systems of communication, they promote vernacular discourse and creativity, permitting ordinary users to produce and distribute staggering quantities of 'user-generated content' (Keane, 2013; Yar, 2014) . 2 Digital platforms are also displacing the mass media as an information source. 3 Finally, as loosely coupled networks of users, their structure not only promotes virality -the rapid and unpredictable diffusion of content -but also fosters an expansive virtual sociality (Baym, 2015; . Here, various attributes -'likes', 'retweets', hashtags (#), mentions (@) and so on -index and anchor communications, promoting awareness of others and uniting spatially dispersed users into communities of shared interest and identity (Murthy, 2013) .",

With information control representing a critical axis of power, social media are frequently depicted as an elite-challenging 'microphone for the masses' (Murthy, 2011; cf. Gerbaudo, 2018; Jenkins, 2006 . Here, the accessibility and sophistication of digital platforms is believed to empower ordinary citizens to make their own news, name issues as public concerns, and shape collective sentiment (Coleman and Ross, 2010; Turner, 2010) . With knowledge production and image-making increasingly steered by non-experts, many perceive citizen journalism as breeding accounts of reality rooted in public-mindedness rather than sensationalism or commercial considerations (Goode, 2009) . In light of such developments, noted panic scholars claim digital media are shifting 'the locus of definitional power', ensuring 'more voices are heard' (Critcher, 2017) and generating 'new possibilities for resistance' (Lindgren, 2013 (Lindgren, : 1243 . Thus, the increasingly nodal configuration of media space has attenuated moral guardians' influence, ensuring that panics are 'more likely to be blunted and scattered among competing narratives' (Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 2010: 99; cf. le Grand, 2016) .",

Alongside being blamed for moral failings -obesity, addiction, disengagement, cultural vacuity, solipsism (Baym, 2015; Thurlow, 2006; Szablewicz, 2010 ) -multi-media platforms have been linked to violent criminality.

Whether employed to advance claims that Harry Potter promotes Satanism and the occult to impressionable youth (Sternheimer, 2014) or discredit public officials and assert a link between vaccinations and autism (Erbschloe, 2018) , digital environments offer optimal arenas for uniting the conspiratorial. Given their accessibility and ease-of-use, they obviate the need for elite participation, promoting patterns of mobilization around issues where all citizens potentially emerge as crusaders (Hier, 2018) . Moreover, social media's 'mob-ocratic' tendencies can activate collective effervescence (Gerbaudo, 2018) , producing panics driven by mass collaboration. Falling into this category are online 'firestorms' (Johnen et al., 2018) , spontaneous and electric outbursts where the documentation and exposure of moral breaches -petty theft, public outbursts, drug use, sexual promiscuity, etc. -are rapidly disseminated, igniting interactive cascades of denigration (Trottier, 2018; Wright, 2017) . Such episodes often culminate in digital vigilantism: forms of extra-judicial punitiveness -ostracism, doxing, harassment, job loss, physical attacks, death threats -that emerge from below (Powell et al., 2018; Trottier, 2017) . 6 Consequently, alongside increasing the frequency and velocity of panics, online environments appear to promote heightened virulence and excoriation. While underpinned by emergent technologies, forms of digitally mediated opprobrium are inseparable from late-modern social conditions as they offer a palliative for ontological precarity and allow otherwise atomized individuals to police social boundaries (Ingraham and Reeves, 2016; cf.

On the one hand, digital platforms permit highly energized and sustained groups to sculpt public sentiment by maximizing the visibility of 'information pollution' and 'fake news' -arresting, sensational and morally tinged content designed to distort and agitate (Kalsnes, 2018) . Whether by steering communications, creating fake accounts, or exploiting digital interactions, techniques of 'attention hacking' can strategically influence engagement patterns and produce wildly disproportionate effects (Marwick and Lewis, 2017) . Ultimately, by allowing users to eliminate ambiguity and delineate moral boundaries in publicly visible ways, sites like Twitter and Facebook generate new types of agency that can rapidly propel the ideas and identities of various outsiders into prominence (Joosse, 2018). 7 With their cacophonous character making it difficult to vet the integrity of content, digital platforms have been inundated with captivating, tendentious and skewed, if not entirely spurious, communications (news stories, videos, memes, blog posts, hashtags, etc.) to distort online conversations and mobilize receptive users. An exemplary case of digitally mediated crusades appeared during the 2016 American election as dedicated members of the 'alt-right', as well as digital mercenaries employed by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russia-backed 'troll farm', devoted considerable energy and resources to shaping political communication and behaviour. Central to their efforts was the creation, sharing, liking and promotion of misinformation and provocative discourse about contentious sociocultural issues, including race relations, gun control, abortion, Islamophobia and men's rights (Bradshaw and Howard, 2017; Nagle, 2017; Singer and Brooking, 2018) . 8 Armed with an appreciation of digital platforms' value in shifting the parameters of public discourse, such actors succeeded in generating virality, obtaining mainstream press coverage, and inciting considerable outcry and anxiety (Phillips, 2018) .",

            "text": "More recently, the role of digital communication in spreading fake news and inciting panic was on full display in initial reactions to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), an infectious respiratory disease of zoonotic origin. Following its emergence in Wuhan, China in January 2020, widespread scapegoating and fear-mongering erupted across social media. In relation to the former, the virus was racialized, with numerous messages linking it to the ostensibly exotic dietary practices and unsanitary behaviour of Chinese populations, with representations depicting them as folk devils and dangerous, impure others (Yang, 2020) . 9 Reflecting a 'politics of substitution' (Jenkins, 1992) , such claims-making diverted attention from considerably more deadly (and preventable) diseases (e.g. malaria), as well as, the structural conditions -media censorship, political corruption, weakly enforced health and safety standards -underlying the emergence and rapid spread of the disease. Digital platforms were also used to circulate misinformation and dire, if not apocalyptic, predictions with various rumours -whether false reports of positive cases and contaminated Chinese imports, stories of individuals absconding from quarantine zones, or claims that the virus was a bioweapon developed by the Chinese or American governments -outpacing official information during the early stages of the outbreak (Bogle, 2020) . By contributing to a broader climate of suspicion, such communications appear to be reactivating fears of a 'yellow peril', as well as producing emergency measures (enhanced surveillance, quarantines, travel bans etc.) and everyday expressions of racism and anti-Chinese sentiment (Dingwall, 2020; Palmer, 2020; Yang, 2020) . As this example reveals, like prior epidemics (SARS, AIDS, etc.) where media coverage promoted fear and opprobrium about various outsiders (gay men, drug users, foreigners; see Muzzatti, 2005; Ungar, 2013; Watney, 1997) , digital communications also play a significant role in distorting understanding and encouraging over-reaction. The episode equally suggests, however, that social media's anonymous, horizontal structure ensures that messages travel exponentially faster, lack clear origins and feature palpable vitriol, outcomes that escalate the impetus and excess of alarm (Miller, 2020) .",

Here, fake accounts are utilized to raise awareness and bolster the credibility of favoured content. On the one hand, advances in artificial intelligence allow bots -machine-led communications tools that mimic human users and perform simple, structurally repetitive, tasks -to spread 'computational propaganda' (Bradshaw and Howard, 2017; Ferrara et al., 2016) . As social machines and artificial voices, bots automate and accelerate diffusion and engagement, creating, liking, sharing, and following content at rates vastly surpassing human capabilities. Thus, they facilitate viral engineering; expanding the momentum of certain messages and, in the process, altering information flows. To exude authority and authenticity, content is also circulated by bogus, 'sockpuppet' accounts posing as those of accredited experts (scientists, journalists, etc.) or ordinary citizens belonging to various groups (women, blue-collar workers, police officers, urban youth, etc.) and appearing to possess folk wisdom (Bastos and Mercea, 2017; Marwick and Lewis, 2017) . Whether manual or automated, techniques of media manipulation also control narratives by reducing the visibility of unwanted and objectionable content. Here, keywords and hashtags affiliated with opposing perspectives can be 'hijacked' as platforms are flooded with nonsense or negative messages to disrupt and drown out specific communications, denuding them of their salience and influence (Woolley and Howard, 2016) .",

By flooding social media with hashtags like #arsonemergency (in place of #climateemergency) and co-opting those already trending (e.g. #australiafire, #bushfireaustralia), such actors sought to publicize conspiracies that criminal elements -whether arsonists, radical environmentalists, or ISIS fighters -were responsible for the blazes and that climate change is an elite-engineered hoax and form of population control (Knaus, 2020) .",

Rather than attracting support through unifying, 'big tent' issues, dataveillance facilitates agile micro-targeted crusades. Able to cleave populations into demographic and affective types, moral guardians can precisely 'hail' subjectivities, allowing them to combine mass transmission with individual connection and overcome what has traditionally been a Hobson's choice between maximal exposure and intimate resonance. Consequently, moral contests promise to become exponentially more sophisticated, ensuring overwrought discourse reaches, motivates and energizes its intended targets. Moreover, given the expressive contours of panics, and the importance of emotions -anxiety, hostility, even hysteria -as levers of action (Walby and Spencer, 2012) , the mining, measurement and classification of affective states allows crusaders to viscerally connect with audiences and strengthen their messaging.",

As such, they are necessarily dependent upon and constituted by claims-making, with interested parties historically seeking to actuate alarm by influencing the imagery and representations of the mainstream press, arrangements disrupted by recent upheavals in media space. To illuminate the complex relationship between panics and the broader socio-technical context in which they unfold, this article has surveyed the impact of digital communications, presenting a taxonomy of social media's effects on the issues, conditions and practices that incite collective alarm. While displaying elite-challenging potential, social media are ultimately Janus-faced and contradictory. Alongside providing emergent sources of unease, they cultivate facilitating conditions and offer ideal venues for constructing social problems. Specifically, by elevating agitational discourse and promoting homophily, social media generate social friction and hostility. Moreover, as instruments of panic production, new technologies reshape the identification and construction of deviance, both permitting lay participation and allowing various parties to manipulate public communications in ways that produce outsized, imperceptible and highly efficient influence.",

            "text": "While gauging the precise effects of social media requires more rigorous scrutiny than can be provided here, the available evidence indicates that, all things considered, they inflate the incidence and severity of panics. On the one hand, various studies suggest that, as architectures of amplification, digital platforms reduce transaction costs and transform peripheral (as well as automated and artificial) voices into conspicuous claimants (Vaidhyanathan, 2018) . 13 They also appear to enhance the spread of information pollution, with scholarship revealing that, whether transmitted by algorithms or human agents, 'misinformation, polarizing, and conspiratorial content' (Howard et al., 2018: 1) not only 'diffuse[s] significantly further, faster, [and] deeper' on social media (Vosoughi et al., 2018 (Vosoughi et al., : 1146 Albright, 2017) but also, during the final days of the 2016 election, represented the most popular informational content on Facebook, leading many to speculate that it played a decisive role in Trump's victory (Waisbord, 2018) . Finally, evidence surrounding the extent to which gross distortions, extremist views and readily falsifiable conspiracies (such as the views that: climate change is a manufactured crisis, violent crime is at historic highs, undocumented migrants are overwhelmingly violent criminals, etc.) are being normalized as public idiom gives considerable cause for concern (McIntyre, 2018; Scheufele and Krause, 2019). 14 Beyond advancing understanding of the media-moral panic relationship, an important task in its own right, by initiating dialogue between theoretical expectations and empirical instances, the preceding analysis promotes conceptual refinement and renewal. Specifically, accounting for social media's effects on panic production illuminates significant mutations surrounding the interactants, functions and communicative patterns that define contemporary crusades. First, as many-to-many systems of communication, social media promote novel patterns of participation, offering ordinary persons a greater role, facilitating spontaneous outbursts driven by multitudes and introducing automated, machine-led campaigns. Additionally, in enabling new techniques of media manipulation, digital platforms contribute to the weaponization of panics. While conventional wisdom suggests that panics represent domestic affairs, oriented towards mobilizing support, acquiring power and status or manufacturing consent, the case of Russia and information warfare suggests that normative conflict may be exogenously engineered to provoke significant social and psychological disruption. Finally, in place of uniform messages and mass appeal, the combination of data-mining and behavioural profiling unleashes claims-making techniques that are inhabited and hyper-targeted.",

In particular, scholars can further refine and expand the concept's range and impact by engaging with social media's diverse and far-reaching effects on the contours of collective alarm. While it is admittedly premature to predict what new attributes media systems will assume, and there is too much contingency to suggest that future developments will follow an inexorable path, it is hoped that, by taking technological change into account, the idea of moral panic will continue to influence understandings of how fear and transgression are mobilized for varied purposes.",

Citing Donald Trump's rise as a charismatic political maverick, Joosse (2018) argues that non-traditional media are ideally suited for producing and reiterating simplistic and highly resonant moral categories, outcomes that can endow otherwise peripheral parties with significant power and influence. 8. While a full discussion exceeds the scope of this article, the alt-right encompasses an illdefined amalgam of actors (white nationalists, men's rights activists, palaeo-conservatives, nativists, etc.) united by opposition to 'identity politics', multiculturalism, and perceived 'political correctness' (Hawley, 2017; Nagle, 2017) . 9.
