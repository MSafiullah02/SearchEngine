Plant\u2010based expression platforms, in particular, offer unique advantages over traditional expression hosts in terms of cost efficiency, product safety, available expertise and facilities for culture and storage, and scalability easily adaptable to production needs (Daniell et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2003; Twyman et al., 2003; Streatfield, 2007). To date, several proteins of medical interest have been expressed successfully in plants, including a variety of antibodies, vaccine antigens, protein allergens, enzymes and enzyme inhibitors, coagulation factors, cytokines and hormones (Hiatt et al., 1989; Mason et al., 1992; Ma et al., 1995, 2003, 2005a; Ruggiero et al., 2000; Kirk and Webb, 2005; Twyman et al., 2005; Floss et al., 2007; Lienard et al., 2007).",

Despite these advances, ensuring satisfactory yield and quality of recombinant proteins often remains a difficult task. Unlike several more stable (and structurally less complex) pharmaceuticals, proteins present a natural tendency to structural heterogeneity, often giving a complex mixture of variants differing in their primary or tertiary structure (Faye et al., 2005). This natural bias of proteins, which underlines important issues of product authenticity and heterogeneity, also emphasizes the need for a correct understanding of the various post\u2010translational steps of the whole protein synthesis\u2010recovery process, from the maturation and assembly of nascent protein backbones in transgenic host cells to the extraction and purification of the protein product after biomass harvesting.",

Living cells are the theatre of numerous proteolytic processes, essential to ensure vital metabolic functions, but often a burden for the effective production of biologically active proteins (Doran, 2006; Goulet and Michaud, 2006). Proteolytic enzymes, or proteases, contribute to the overall control of metabolic and transduction pathways by directing the activation or hydrolysis of proteins implicated in key regulatory processes, or by contributing to the elimination of misfolded proteins and the selective recycling of amino acids from short\u2010lived proteins (Vierstra, 2003; Schaller, 2004). In plants, these enzymes also initiate the general recycling of proteins in senescing organs and the mobilization of amino acid constituents of seed or tuber storage proteins during germination (M\u00fcntz, 2007). Hundreds of genes code for proteins involved in proteolytic processes in plants (Rawlings et al., 2008), with, for instance, an estimate of 1900 genes in Arabidopsis directly or indirectly implicated in the hydrolysis of peptide bonds (Schaller, 2004; Smalle and Vierstra, 2004).",

Although some proteins accumulate at high levels in plant systems, other proteins apparently undergo extensive hydrolysis, with a strong negative impact on the final yield despite easily detectable mRNA transcripts. Accumulation levels below 0.01% of total soluble protein (TSP) in plant tissues have been observed for several proteins of therapeutic value, including, for instance, human serum protein C, interferon \u03b2, erythropoietin and epidermal growth factor (Daniell et al., 2001).

Depending on the number of \u2018susceptible\u2019 cleavage sites accessible to endogenous proteases for peptide bond hydrolysis, the protein may undergo complete hydrolysis directly impacting on its final yield or partial trimming, altering the activity or homogeneity of the final protein product. Although interesting yields may be obtained in terms of net protein levels, the final product may show altered integrity, structural heterogeneity and/or deficient biological activity, potentially altering its value for commercialization (Faye et al., 2005). Several strategies have been considered recently to minimize proteolysis in plant protein factories. This article summarizes these strategies, taking into account proteolysis observed in planta before harvesting, and unwanted proteolytic degradation observed ex planta during protein recovery from plant tissues and cells.",

Cellular proteases, notably, differ from one tissue to another in terms of quantity and quality (or overall substrate specificity) (Schaller, 2004), with a possible differential impact on the integrity of proteins. Historically, recombinant proteins in plants have often been expressed under the control of strong constitutive promoters, such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the maize ubiquitin 1 promoter, but several tissue\u2010/organ\u2010specific (e.g. seed\u2010specific) promoters have been isolated and are now used to express transgenes in selected tissues and organs (Potenza et al., 2004). In practice, an effective scheme for recombinant protein production should not only provide effective transcription of the transgene sequence, but also involve an accumulation site with low levels of overall proteolytic activity or with endogenous protease species showing no (or little) specific activity against accessible peptide bonds in the protein of interest.",

However, the highly active metabolism of leaf tissues, which typically exhibit high protein synthesis and turnover rates, may represent a significant hurdle to protein accumulation in vivo. In particular, increased protease levels in senescing leaves (Kato et al., 2004, 2005; Lin and Wu, 2004; Otegui et al., 2005; Parrott et al., 2005) represent a potential drawback in leaf\u2010based production systems (Stevens et al., 2000; Birch\u2010Machin et al., 2004), both in vivo before protein recovery when senescence\u2010associated amino acid recycling is initiated, and in vitro during extraction once cellular proteases have been released into the extraction medium together with the protein(s) of interest. The abundance of poorly specific proteases and phenolic compounds in green tissues (Michaud and Asselin, 1995) also leads to the problem of post\u2010harvest protein degradation and denaturation in leaves, which can make it necessary to process leaf biomass shortly after harvest, or to store this material at low temperatures until protein extraction (Schillberg et al., 2005).",

Proteins of clinical interest have been successfully expressed in seeds of several species, including major cereal crops (e.g. maize, rice, barley and wheat), soybean and safflower, under the control of either constitutive or seed\u2010specific promoters. Recombinant proteins in seeds often accumulate in storage organelles, mainly in protein bodies and protein storage vacuoles (Streatfield et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2005; Drakakaki et al., 2006). The desiccated nature of mature seeds, together with the low abundance of active proteases in seed tissues during dormancy, prevent extensive proteolysis and promote long\u2010term stability of proteins in planta (Fiedler and Conrad, 1995; Stoger et al., 2000). In a similar manner, the tubers and storage roots of some species exhibit reduced metabolic activity, and may represent an interesting solution for recombinant protein storage. Artsaenko et al. (1998), for instance, documented the long\u2010term stability of a single\u2010chain Fv antibody in potato tubers after storage for more than a year. From a technological viewpoint, storage organs also present anatomical features favourable to protein stability, such as the presence of protein and oil bodies in seeds, that may sequester proteins and minimize their exposure to proteases during extraction (Stoger et al., 2005).",

            "text": "In practice, the absence of a targeting signal in the transgene sequence prevents migration of the recombinant protein out of the cytosol following mRNA translation (Figure 1). Recombinant proteins retained in the cytosol are usually detected at very low levels despite good transgene transcription rates, giving, in several cases, accumulation rates below 0.1% of TSP (Conrad and Fiedler, 1998). Cytosolic targeting of the tomato mosaic virus antibody \u2018rAb29\u2019 in tobacco leaf cells, for instance, resulted in very weak accumulation rates, whereas the same transgene including a signal peptide for extracellular secretion produced easily detectable amounts of this protein (Schillberg et al., 1999). Similarly, retaining human growth hormone in the cytosol of N. benthamiana leaf cells led to protein levels of about 0.01% of TSP, in contrast with concentrations reaching 10% of TSP for the same protein targeted to the apoplast (Gils et al., 2005). Several factors may explain the limited suitability of the cytosol as a destination for recombinant proteins: (i) the negative redox potential of the cytosolic milieu, unfavourable to the correct folding of proteins with disulphide bonds (Goulet and Michaud, 2006); (ii) the absence of important co\u2010 and post\u2010translational modification processes, such as glycosylation, which may have a positive impact on the folding, assembly and/or structural stability of several nascent and mature proteins (Faye et al., 2005); and (iii) the effective housekeeping activity of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome proteolytic pathway in this cellular compartment (Vierstra, 1996, \n2003), involved notably in the recognition and degradation of incorrectly folded proteins. Although some recombinant proteins remain stable in the cytosol (e.g. Michaud et al., 1998; De Jaeger et al., 1999; Rajabi\u2010Memari et al., 2006; Marusic et al., 2007), alternative destinations, such as the chloroplast, the ER or the apoplast, appear to be more appropriate for most proteins.",

In practice, the addition of an N\u2010terminal signal peptide sequence to the protein\u2010encoding transgene triggers a co\u2010translational transfer of the nascent protein to the endomembrane system (Chrispeels and Faye, 1996) (Figure 1). Proteins bearing a signal peptide for cellular secretion first enter the ER via the ER protein translocation channel (Galili et al., 1998), and then migrate through this compartment and the Golgi apparatus until reaching the extracellular medium (default pathway) or the vacuole, if a vacuolar sorting signal is found in the primary sequence. Recombinant proteins entering the ER may also be retained in this compartment by simple apposition of the tetrapeptide ER retention signal (K/H)DEL (Michaud et al., 1998) or grafting of a \u03b3\u2010zein proline\u2010rich domain (Mainieri et al., 2004) at the C\u2010terminus. The (K/H)DEL motif is a common ER retrieval signal in eukaryotes, believed to redirect tagged proteins to the ER after their recognition by a (K/H)DEL receptor complex in the Golgi apparatus (Lee et al., 1993; Pagny et al., 2000). In contrast with most reticuloplasmins, cereal prolamins accumulate in the ER of seed cells without the involvement of the (K/H)DEL motif, forming high\u2010density protein bodies by a sequence\u2010specific sorting mechanism yet to be elucidated (Vitale and Pedrazzini, 2005). In practice, the retention of zein (and other prolamins) in the ER, and the concomitant formation of protein bodies, may be easily reproduced in both storage and vegetative tissues of transgenic plants (Geli et al., 1994; Coleman et al., 1996), which makes this system potentially useful for the high\u2010level accumulation of recombinant proteins in planta and their easy recovery in crude extract preparations by gradient centrifugation procedures (Torrent et al., 2006a, b).",

The ER, which constitutes a natural reservoir for some storage proteins in seed cells (Shewry and Halford, 2002), can physically accommodate high levels of recombinant protein product in planta (Wandelt et al., 1992). At the biochemical level, the low abundance of proteolytic enzymes and the presence of molecular chaperones in the ER, together with an oxidizing status favouring disulphide bond formation, make this organelle a suitable destination for several proteins susceptible to rapid turnover or showing a complex folding pathway (Nuttall et al., 2002; Faye et al., 2005). Several reports have documented the positive impact of ER retention on the production of recombinant antibodies in terms of protein stability, quality or yield (Schouten et al., 1996; Conrad and Fiedler, 1998; Stoger et al., 2002; Gomord et al., 2004). Similar tendencies have been observed for several other proteins of medical or industrial interest, including, as recent examples, human interleukin\u20104 (Ma et al., 2005b), the SARS coronavirus S protein antigen (Pogrebnyak et al., 2005), the synthetic silk\u2010like protein DR1B (Yang et al., 2005) and a recombinant phytase from Aspergillus niger (Peng et al., 2006).",

To be stable or active, a number of clinically useful proteins require late post\u2010translational modifications, such as the formation of complex glycans, the addition of a lipid moiety or the proteolytic removal of a propeptide sequence, which may occur downstream of the ER along the secretory pathway, notably in the Golgi, vacuole or apoplast (Gomord and Faye, 2004; Faye et al., 2005). Other proteins may exhibit an altered integrity or structural heterogeneity in the ER, as a result of unintended proteolytic processing by ER\u2010resident proteases (Faye et al., 2005). The ER lumen is generally considered to be a mild environment for labile, e.g. immature, proteins, but proteolytic processing events altering the structure of secreted proteins have been observed in this compartment (Bass et al., 2000; Schmitz and Herzog, 2004). For instance, the bovine plasma protein aprotinin expressed in leaves of transgenic potato showed structural heterogeneity when accumulated in the ER, presumably as a result of the sequential removal of specific amino acids at the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini by endogenous peptidases (Badri et al., 2005). A potential solution to prevent unintended proteolytic processing in the ER, or later along the secretory pathway (Sharp and Doran, 2001), is to identify and mutate susceptible amino acid sites by site\u2010directed mutagenesis, as suggested by Outchkourov et al. (2003) for the sea anemone protein equistatin, processed to several truncated forms in the secretory pathway of transgenic potato leaf cells by arginine/lysine\u2010 and asparagine\u2010specific cysteine proteases.",

The extracellular medium typically exhibits a high proteolytic content (Callis, 1995; Hellwig et al., 2004; Schiermeyer et al., 2005), but several recombinant proteins tagged for extracellular secretion have been produced successfully in plant or plant cell platforms over the last few years (Gaume et al., 2003; Sojikul et al., 2003; Streatfield et al., 2003; Wirth et al., 2004; Hellwig et al., 2004; Komarnytsky et al., 2004; Gils et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2005).

The vacuole plays several important roles in planta, including the control of cell turgor, the turnover of macromolecules, the sequestration of toxic secondary metabolites and the storage of high\u2010energy compounds in seeds or vegetative storage tissues (Marty, 1999). Recent evidence in the literature has suggested the occurrence of two distinct types of vacuole in plant cells: lytic (or vegetative) vacuoles, which present an acidic environment rich in hydrolytic enzymes; and protein storage vacuoles, which show a slightly acidic or neutral pH well adapted to protein storage (Robinson et al., 2005). Targeting to the vacuole, although not yet fully understood, is determined by small stretches of amino acids within the protein primary sequence acting as sorting signals to direct the maturing protein towards the vacuole (Neuhaus and Rogers, 1998; Mackenzie, 2005; Vitale and Hinz, 2005). In general, lytic vacuoles are not considered as a suitable destination for recombinant proteins in planta, owing to their high proteolytic content (Goulet and Michaud, 2006). By contrast, protein storage vacuoles present a milder environment compatible with protein accumulation (Stoger et al., 2005), especially in seeds, where they are most abundant (M\u00fcntz, 1998; Park et al., 2004).",

In practice, correct in situ localization of recombinant proteins bearing a sorting sequence for vacuolar targeting should be undertaken on a systematic basis, considering the species\u2010 or tissue\u2010dependent functionality of some sorting signals (Vitale and Hinz, 2005). A good example of this phenomenon has been provided for a fungal phytase expressed in rice, which was readily detected in the apoplastic environment of leaf tissues, but retained in ER protein bodies and protein storage vacuoles in the seed endosperm (Drakakaki et al., 2006). As illustrated with the silk\u2010like protein DP1B expressed in Arabidopsis (Yang et al., 2005), the impact of vacuolar targeting on the stability and yield of recombinant proteins is also tissue dependent. Although this protein was found at levels reaching 8% of TSP in seed storage vacuoles, no detectable levels of the same protein could be observed in leaf cell vacuoles. In a similar manner, targeting DP1B to the apoplast provided good yields in leaves, but poor yields in seeds (Yang et al., 2005), again stressing the need for an empirical case\u2010by\u2010case assessment of different tissue and cellular destinations for each protein expressed.",

The chloroplast stroma supports protein post\u2010translational modifications, such as multimerization and disulphide bridge formation (Daniell, 2006), making it a suitable environment for the expression of proteins not relying on complex modifications, such as glycosylation, typical of the cell secretory pathway. Several transplastomic plant lines have been engineered over the last 10 years for recombinant protein expression, providing very high yields for a number of useful proteins of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin, including somatotropin, serum albumin, anthrax protective antigen, cholera toxin B subunit and tetanus toxin fragment C (Daniell et al., 2001, 2005; Tregoning et al., 2003).",

An interesting example has been provided for the rotavirus VP6 protein, which showed high accumulation rates in chloroplasts of young tobacco leaves, but negligible rates in older leaves, despite comparable levels of mRNA transcripts (Birch\u2010Machin et al., 2004). A similar decline in older tissues was observed for a fungal xylanase (Hyunjong et al., 2006) and for the insecticidal Bt toxin Cry2Aa2 (De Cosa et al., 2001), again stressing the importance of a careful assessment of the stability of each recombinant protein in different physiological or environmental contexts. Recombinant protein degradation by chloroplast proteases might appear, however, to be a non\u2010relevant issue in terms of net production yields for some proteins expressed at very high levels (Daniell, 2006). The proteolysis\u2010labile protein human serum albumin, for instance, was found at levels reaching 11% of TSP in transplastomic tobacco lines developed using chloroplast untranslated regions in gene constructs, in sharp contrast with levels below 0.02% of TSP in lines developed using the commonly employed Shine\u2013Delgarno regulatory sequence (Fernandez\u2010San Millan et al., 2003). This dramatic increase, probably the result of an increased expression rate of the transgene, was also associated with the formation of large inclusion bodies in vivo (Fernandez\u2010San Millan et al., 2003), which presumably sequestered the recombinant protein and prevented its hydrolysis in planta, as described earlier for a number of proteins expressed in heterologous environments (Enfors, 1992).",

Site\u2010directed mutagenesis may prove to be useful, in particular, in improving the intrinsic stability of labile proteins in plant cells, as proposed previously for recombinant proteins expressed in microbial systems (Rozkov and Enfors, 2004; Macauley\u2010Patrick et al., 2005). Any recombinant protein, depending on its structural characteristics, potentially includes protease\u2010susceptible amino acid sites sterically accessible to endogenous proteases in the transgenic host organism. In theory, the identification of such susceptible sites in the polypeptide chain, together with a correct knowledge of the host proteolytic machinery, can provide useful information for the design of protein variants with improved stability in vivo (Rozkov et al., 2000). To our knowledge, this approach has not yet been applied to recombinant proteins expressed in plants, but the characterization of specific proteolytic events implicating recombinant proteins in transgenic plants (e.g. Outchkourov et al., 2003; Badri, 2006) should provide, in forthcoming years, a workable framework for the rational engineering of protein variants with improved resistance to plant proteases. The design of structurally stabilized, thermostable protein variants integrating one or several \u2018consensus\u2019 (conserved) amino acids (Lehmann et al., 2002) may also prove to be interesting in the future, considering the strong positive correlation between the improved thermostability of such mutant proteins and their resistance to proteolysis (Amin et al., 2004).",

Early studies with staphylococcal protein A and streptococcal albumin\u2010binding protein demonstrated the potential of fusion partners as promoting agents for recombinant protein accumulation in vivo (Nygren et al., 1994; Stahl et al., 1997). In plants, several studies have been published describing the positive impact of protein fusion partners on the accumulation of recombinant proteins. Examples have been provided for the marker proteins \u03b2\u2010glucuronidase and luciferase and, more recently, for the cholera toxin B subunit, which were accumulated at higher rates in transgenic potato or tobacco leaves when the regulatory protein ubiquitin was fused and transiently present at the N\u2010terminus (Garbino et al., 1995; Hondred et al., 1999; Mishra et al., 2006). More recently, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 core antigen expressed in tobacco leaves showed an accumulation level increased by more than 10\u2010fold when heavy chains of a human immunoglobulin A were fused at the C\u2010terminus (Obregon et al., 2006). In a similar manner, the accumulation rates of spider silk proteins, single\u2010chain antibody fragments, gp130 polypeptides and mammalian interleukins in transgenic tobacco lines were significantly improved when elastin\u2010like polypeptides, including repeats of the elastin motif VPGXG (valine\u2010proline\u2010glycine\u2010Xaa\u2010glycine), were fused at the C\u2010terminus (Scheller et al., 2004, 2006; Lin et al., 2006; Patel et al., 2007). Although work is still required to devise efficient procedures for the proteolytic removal of fusion partners and to understand the mechanisms by which the different fusion partners exert their stabilizing effect, these observations clearly suggest the potential of fusion protein technologies for the improvement of recombinant protein yields in plants.",

In theory, protease processes affecting recombinant protein accumulation could be contained using antisense or RNA silencing strategies implemented in transgenic host plants (Watson et al., 2005). Alternatively, recombinant protease inhibitors active against specific endogenous proteases could prove functional to modulate proteolytic activities in situ (Faye et al., 2005). Recent evidence in the literature has suggested that the ectopic expression of protease inhibitors may have a positive impact on protein levels in leaves, with negligible effects on growth and development. The broad\u2010spectrum inhibitor tomato cathepsin D inhibitor (CDI), for instance, has been shown to yield increased TSP levels (by 20%\u201335%) in leaves of transgenic potato lines accumulating this inhibitor in the cytosolic compartment (Michaud et al., 2005). Likewise, the rice cysteine protease inhibitor oryzacystatin I led to total protein levels higher than expected in tobacco leaf tissues expressing this inhibitor in the cytosol (van der Vyver et al., 2003). The design of transgenic plant lines deficient in specific protease activities could now represent a challenging but worthwhile task, which could provide mild cellular environments tailored for the expression and accumulation of fragile proteins. A convincing demonstration supporting the potential of this approach was provided by Komarnytsky et al. (2006), who successfully stabilized recombinant antibodies secreted by the roots of transgenic tobacco plants also expressing (and co\u2010secreting) a Bowman\u2013Birk trypsin inhibitor from soybean.",

Compared with animal or microbial cells, plant cells from metabolically active tissues typically show a low protein content, and the vacuole(s), which account(s) for most of the cell volume, contain(s) highly reactive compounds potentially deleterious to proteins (Michaud and Asselin, 1995). During extraction, at least some protein loss is to be expected, given the occurrence of poorly soluble material interacting non\u2010specifically with proteins in crude preparations, and the systematic release of protein denaturing agents, including phenolics and proteases, after cell disruption (Menkhaus et al., 2004; Saravanan and Rose, 2004). Although the onset of protein\u2013protease interactions specific to each protein and expression platform will generally dictate the empirical development of adapted protection strategies during protein recovery, general guidelines have been proposed over the years to prevent protein loss in plant biomass and protein extracts (Jervis and Pierpoint, 1989; Michaud and Asselin, 1995; Michaud, 1998; Menkhaus et al., 2004; Schillberg et al., 2005). In summary, these guidelines recommend: (i) the processing of biomass shortly after harvest for plant material retrieved from metabolically active tissues; and (ii) the adoption of laboratory practices preventing or at least minimizing protein loss and denaturation in crude extracts, including the processing of sample tissues at low temperatures, the addition of chelators and phenolic\u2010neutralizing compounds in the extraction buffer, the use of low\u2010molecular\u2010weight protease inhibitors active against the host plant endogenous proteases and the use of pH conditions unfavourable to proteolytic activity in crude extracts (Michaud and Asselin, 1995). Protein extraction in acidic conditions, notably, may provide a simple method of preventing unwanted degradation of proteins extracted from several plant tissues, whilst also helping to avoid contamination of crude preparations with proteolytic fragments of larger proteins when low\u2010molecular\u2010weight proteins are to be isolated (Zhang et al., 2006). For instance, studies have illustrated the usefulness of trifluoroacetic acid for the effective isolation and enrichment of bioactive polypeptides from different sources in stable and active forms (Pearce et al., 2001; Huffaker et al., 2006; Yamaguchi et al., 2006).",

Although the testing of different inhibitors is suggested given the general diversity of protease activities in plant crude extracts, small broad\u2010spectrum inhibitors, such as chymostatin and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, often constitute a good starting point for the stabilization of heterologous proteins in vitro, especially in crude extracts prepared from metabolically active tissues, such as stems or green leaves (Figure 2).",

Broad\u2010spectrum protease inhibitors, such as the serine\u2010type inhibitors tomato CDI and bovine aprotinin, appear to be well suited as such effective companion inhibitors, as illustrated by the strong stabilization of the marker protein neomycin phosphotransferase II released in leaf crude extracts of tomato CDI\u2010 and bovine aprotinin\u2010expressing potato plants (Rivard et al., 2006).

Rhizosecretion and leaf guttation represent two such processes allowing for the non\u2010destructive secretion and extraction\u2010free recovery of recombinant proteins (Komarnytsky et al., 2000; Gaume et al., 2003).

This approach is based on the ability of hairy roots to secrete proteins in hydroponic media, which can be recovered easily and used as simple source material for protein enrichment and purification (Komarnytsky et al., 2004). Interestingly, rhizosecretion, and hence recombinant protein release, can be significantly boosted by the initiation of hairy roots following treatment with Agrobacterium rhizogenes (Gaume et al., 2003), thus providing an efficient source of recombinant protein throughout the host plant's life.",

Compared with transgenic plant lines, cultured cells offer a high level of containment, and represent a useful tool for designing simple recovery and purification strategies from source media containing low levels of contaminants. However, some recombinant proteins may undergo extensive hydrolysis in culture media, owing to the secretion of proteolytic enzymes by growing cells (Lee et al., 2002; Kwon et al., 2003; Schiermeyer et al., 2005; Ganapathi et al., 2007). The extracellular concentration of human granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor, for instance, reached a maximum in tobacco cell cultures at the mid\u2010exponential phase, but then decreased rapidly in the culture medium, together with a dramatic increase in protease activity in the culture medium (Lee et al., 2002). In a similar manner, accumulation of the fibrinolytic protease \u03b11 plasminogen activator from Desmodus rotundus was dramatically hampered in the culture medium of BY\u20102 tobacco cells, presumably as a result of extensive degradation by secreted metalloproteases (Schiermeyer et al., 2005). The addition of protein\u2010stabilizing agents, such as low\u2010molecular\u2010weight protease inhibitors or polymers (e.g. gelatin, albumin, polyethylene glycol or polyvinylpyrrolidone), to the culture medium has been proposed to prevent protein loss in plant cell cultures (Bateman et al., 1997; LaCount et al., 1997; Tsoi and Doran, 2002; Schiermeyer et al., 2005; Soderquist and Lee, 2005; Ganapathi et al., 2007).
