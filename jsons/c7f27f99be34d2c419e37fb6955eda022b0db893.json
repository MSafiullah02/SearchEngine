Fluorogenic screening indicated that these analogs are micromolar or submicromolar inhibitors, both enzymes being more active against hAPN. In order to better understand the mode of the action of the most active compounds, molecular modeling was used. It confirmed that aminophosphonic portion of the enzyme is bound nearly identically in the case of all the studied compounds, whereas the difference in activity results from the placement of aromatic side chain of an inhibitor. Interestingly, both enantiomers of the individual compounds are usually bound quite similarly.",

APN mainly cleaves the neutral amino acid from N-terminus of peptides and proteins. Consequently, it plays multifunctional roles in important biological processes, including antigen processing and presentation; tumor invasion and metastasis; cell adhesion and motility; and neurotransmitter degradation [9] [10] [11] [12] . It also serves as a receptor for entry of certain coronaviruses [13, 14] . Since it was the first metallo-aminopeptidase to be biochemically and enzymatically characterized, it is perhaps the most extensively studied member in this family. Critical relevance of its activity for cancer progression caused intensive studies to be undertaken to develop new drugs directed towards this enzyme, including enzyme inhibitors and APN-targeted carrier constructs [15, 16] . As a consequence, a variety of APN inhibitors have been developed [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum and the oily residues was taken into DCM, washed twice with 80% saturated brine to remove excess of ammonium formate and finally washed with water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated. The obtained oil was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate containing 5% of ethanol) and the resulting aminophoshonate (6) was used in the next step.",

Fluorogenic substrate-Ala-AMC (l-alanine-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) was obtained from PeptaNova (Sandhausen, Germany). Both enzymes were dissolved in corresponding 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer and directly used in enzymatic analysis. The pHs of the buffers were as follows: 7.00 for hAPN and 7.20 for pAPN. Michaelis constants (Km) for the both enzymes towards Ala-AMC were determined as described in the literature [31] . Km values were 73 \u00b5M for hAPN and 90 \u00b5M for pAPN. Due to the very high polarity and low solubility of all the inhibitors in the assay buffer, they were transformed into hydrochlorides. Inhibitory constants measurements were carried out in 96-well plates, the total volume of 100 \u00b5L at 37 \u2022 C using a spectrofluorometer (SpectraMax Gemini EM fluorometer-Molecular Devices, San Jose, USA) operating at two wavelengths: excitation 355 nm and emission 460 nm. hAPN and pAPN were preincubated for 30 min in the assay buffer and further added to the wells containing appropriate concentrations of the substrate and the inhibitor. The measurement conditions in the plates were as follows: (i) eight inhibitor concentrations in the range 100-0.8 \u00b5M, (ii) substrate concentration of 50 \u00b5M for hAPN and 80 \u00b5M for pAPN and (iii) enzyme concentrations of 0.66 nM. The release of the fluorogenic leaving group of AMC was monitored for at least 15 min. The rate of enzymatic reaction was studied following the reaction progress curve, based on which velocity was calculated. Each experiment was repeated three times and standard deviation values were calculated. The type of the inhibition and inhibitory constants were calculated by using the Lineweaver-Burk, Dixon plot and Cheng-Prusoff equation: K i = IC 50 /[1 + (S/K m )] as described earlier [32] . Kinetics parameters were calculated using GrafPad Prism and Microsoft Excel computer programs.",

Bearing in mind the known instability of intermediates: phenylacetic acid chlorides, ketophosphonates and their oximes, we decided to apply the \"on-line\" process of using crude intermediates without purification (Scheme 1). Briefly, the reactions began with the conversions of phenylacetic acids into their chlorides 2 by action of thionyl chloride. Resulting chlorides were immediately reacted with triethyl phosphite yielding the corresponding ketophosphonates (compounds 3), which exist in equilibrium with tautomeric enols (compounds 4) [45] . Subsequent reaction of these mixtures with hydroxylamine resulted in mixtures of E/Z oximes 5. Reduction of the oximes, performed by using ammonium formate and zinc in molar ratio 2:1 [46] , provided two phosphonates-compounds 6 and their formylated derivatives 7 clearly seen in 31 P NMR spectra. We succeeded in the isolation and crystal structure determination of one of them; namely, diethyl 1-N-formylamino-2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethylphosphonate (compound 7d, Figure S7 ). The formation of these side products is not surprising, and it does not have an influence on the overall yield of aminophosphonic acids 1, which were obtained, after hydrolysis of the mixtures of compounds 6 and 7 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, with a satisfactory overall yield of about 30% (see representative NMR spectra, Figures S5 and S6) . Reduction of oximes is a key step in this procedure, and the alternative application of ammonium formate/10% Pd/C [47] and ammonium formate/magnesium systems failed [48] .",

Their potencies towards human enzymes are about an order in magnitude higher than for porcine enzymes. However, the pattern of structure-activity is nearly identical. Phosphonic acid analog of phenylalanine (1-amino-2-phenylethylphosphonic acid, PheP, compound 1a) was treated as prototypical compound and may be considered positive control. Its inhibitory activity towards pAPN is in a good agreement with that found in the literature (73.3 \u00b5M for racemic mixture versus 27.5 \u00b5M found for l-aminophosphonate-PheP) [25] . Ten out of the 24 phosphonic analogs of phenylalanine displayed significantly higher activity than PheP towards both enzymes. In the case of human enzyme (hAPN) three of them (compounds 1i, 1l and 1t) demonstrated submicromolar inhibitory constants. The remaining seven displayed only 2-10 fold weaker effects. Similarly potent activity was observed in the case of porcine enzyme (pAPN), for which compounds 1i, 1l and 1t acted as micromolar inhibitors. On the other hand, six inhibitors conferred weaker activity than PheP. Aromatic rings of three of them were substituted with trifluoromethyl group (compounds  1v, 1x and 1y) . In this respect, the rather high potencies of compounds 1w and 1z are somewhat surprising. The remaining four compounds were more or less equipotent with the positive control 1a. Compound 8 appeared to be a weak inhibitor of both enzymes.",

Figure 1 presents global views of the results of docking of all the 25 analogs (both isomers) of phenylalanine (compounds 1a-1z) to hAPN ( Figure 1A ) and pAPN ( Figure 1B) . These studies revealed an almost identical coordination mode of the aminophosphonate portions of all molecules to both enzymes. The phosphonate group is considered a transition-state analog of the hydrolysis of peptide bond, and its binding seems to confirm this assumption. Thus, two phosphonate oxygens are involved in zinc complexation, whereas a third oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with tyrosine (Tyr472 of pAPN and Tyr477 of hAPN). In most cases the free \u03b1-amino group shows a typical pattern of contacts with glutamate and glutamine residues (Glu350 and Glu384 of pAPN; and Glu355, Glu411 and Gln213 of hAPN). The hydrophobic S1 pocket of both aminopeptidases is responsible for recognition of N-terminal amino acids of the hydrolyzed substrates. Filling the S1 pocket with aromatic fragments of inhibitors should thus play a canonical role in inhibitory process. The molecular docking indicated that it indeed seems to be true for the human enzyme; however, in rare cases, the aromatic side-chains of the studied inhibitors interact preferably with the S1 pocket, a pocket which is naturally involved in accommodating the C-terminal side of a hydrolyzed peptide substrate. In the case of the porcine enzyme, reversal of this situation is observed, since most of the inhibitors locate their aromatic parts in the S1 pocket, which is a surprising and unexpected result. A similar effect, albeit less pronounced, was already observed earlier for interactions of phosphonic acid analogs of phenylglycine and pAPN [28] . The most important differences are seen between types and positions of the substituents in the aromatic moieties of the inhibitors, and their interactions with surrounding amino acid backbones. The nature of these interactions can significantly affect the arrangement of phenyl ring inside hydrophobic S1 and S1 pockets and determine the final potency of the respective inhibitors.",

This effect was more pronounced for the human enzyme (Figure 2A) , wherein the amino group from S isomer is coordinated by the side chain of Met354 of the S1 pocket, instead a typical contribution of the Glu411 in hydrogen binding acting as it is in the case of the R isomer. This difference should moderately affect the binding affinities of both enantiomers. In the case of porcine enzyme ( Figure 2B ) the differences in binding of the two enantiomers are significant and should reflect in their different affinities to the enzyme. This difference results from the lack of contacts of the aromatic fragment of the S isomer with the neighboring amino acids side chains, whereas the aromatic portion of the R isomer interacts with the hydrophobic S1 pocket built of Gly347, Ala348, Ala361 and Val380. The binding mode of 1-amino-2-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)ethylphosphonic acid (compound 1l, Figure 3 ) is quite similar to that of 1i. Computations predict similar binding modes of this compound to both enzymes. The differences in the geometric binding of R and S isomers could be considered minute, albeit their affinities should be different. In the case of hAPN ( Figure 3A ), additional coordination of the phosphonic moiety by Ala253 residue seems to be responsible by optimal arrangements of both isomers in the active site. In the case of the R isomer, this alanine additionally interacts with the amine portion of 1l. The aromatic portion of isomer S is coordinated by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with Phe896, while para-fluorine forms a hydrogen bond with Ser895. These interactions are anchoring this isomer in the S1 pocket and should be reflected in its stronger binding. In the case of pAPN ( Figure 3B ), alanine (Ala346) is involved in the interaction with the phosphonic group only of isomer R. This isomer is also additionally stabilized by interaction of its amine with His383, and thus should be a more effective inhibitor. Quite interestingly, the docking predicted two slightly different modes of binding of both enantiomers of 1-amino-2-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)ethylphosphonic acid (compound 1t) to hAPN ( Figure S8A ). Depending on the absolute configuration of the \u03b1-carbon of this inhibitor, the position of enzyme Phe472 is changed. This reflects with positioning of both enantiomers of the inhibitor. Thus, in the case of the R isomer, calculations predicted an interaction of Phe472 with the aromatic ring of the inhibitor, whereas in the case of the S isomer-the chlorine substituent. For isomer S, additional interactions between chlorine with Ala214 and fluorine with Ser895 contributed to slight diversification of its emplacement in hydrophobic pocket S1. It is worth noting that fluorine-Ser 895 interactions are identical for S isomers of compounds 1l and 1t, thereby explaining why this substitution is profitable.",

Once more, the phosphonic part of the molecule interacts with zinc ion and tyrosines present in the active site, whereas aromatic part of 1g is bound in the S1 pocket of hAPN ( Figure S9A ) and the S1 pocket of pAPN ( Figure S9B ). Moreover, fluorine atoms are involved in hydrogen bonds with some portions of the enzyme (Gln213 and Glu389 in the case of hAPN and Ala346 for pAPN). Thus, the pattern of binding does not explain the huge (two orders in magnitude) differences in affinities of 1t versus 1g observed experimentally. However, calculations indicate that there exists strong internal hydrogen bonding between fluorine and amine nitrogen atoms in molecule 1g ( Figure S9C ), which has to be disrupted upon binding. This might affect the energetics of the binding similarly to that reported for the influence the desolvation of peptidomimetic inhibitors, which strongly decreases their affinities towards thermolysin [52] .",

Although modeling predicts that aromatic side chains of the studied inhibitors are bound in two different hydrophobic pockets (S1 in case of hAPN and S1 for pAPN) the structure-activity relationship is similar for both enzymes. This suggests that S1 and S1 pockets are similar to each other. On the other hand, the bindings of the aromatic moieties of 1i, 1l and 1t to the S1 pocket of hAPN versus the S1 pocket of pAPN seem to explain the differences in affinities of these compounds towards both enzymes.",

The most active compounds of the series (1i, 1l and 1t) may be considered as interesting building blocks for the synthesis of novel inhibitors of aminopeptidases. Computer-aided modeling of their interactions with both enzymes have shown that their aminophosphonate fragments are uniformly bound to the active sites of both aminopeptidases, whereas binding of the aromatic portions of inhibitory molecules to the spacious hydrophobic pockets S1 and S1 is dependent of their substitution patterns and weakly dependent on the absolute molecular configuration.
