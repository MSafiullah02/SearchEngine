Zhejiang Province has the biggest number of pediatric cases (10), because of earlier and wider application of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection of clinical samples. All the ten pediatric patients, of age from 112 days to 17 years, are mild cases, and only three showed pneumonia. Based on the current data in pediatric cases, this recommendation focuses on pediatric respiratory infections caused by 2019-nCoV, not pneumonia only. To make it more helpful for first-line clinicians to judge patients' conditions, this recommendation is detailed in physical examinations, systemic symptoms, and clinical classifications, particularly in the definition of severe and critical cases. Since most pediatric cases are family clusters, a history of close contact with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV within 2 weeks prior to disease onset should be paid more attention to. Meanwhile, considering the probability of vertical mother-to-child transmission, \"newborns delivered by mothers with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection\" is also considered as one epidemiological evidence. We highlight the principles of early identification, early isolation, early diagnosis, and early treatment in managing pediatric cases. As to treatment, rational medication is highlighted for mild cases. For critical cases, more invasive technique such as ECMO support can be used if indicated.",

With further case data collection and accumulated experiences in managing pediatric cases infected by 2019-nCoV, this recommendation will be updated and improved. With stringent prevention and control strategies, we believe we can win the fight against this epidemic.",
