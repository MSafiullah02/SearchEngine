Moreover, we show that this simple epidemiological simulator can be used to assess the efficacy of the response of a government/society to an outbreak. We believe that the simplicity and accuracy of this model will greatly contribute to democratizing the availability of knowledge in societies regarding the extent of an epidemic event and the efficacy of a governmental response.",

A second differential equation states that the rate of accumulation of the infected but asymptotic population is proportional to the population of infected and symptomatic subjects (equation 2). Two additional equations relate the number of deaths and recovered patients with the number of newly infected ones (equation 3 and 4) .

We have selected these three data sets to illustrate that the evolution of the epidemic has a local flavor that mainly depends on the number of initial infected persons, the demographic density, and the set of containment measures taken by government officials and society. During the exponential phase, a straight line should be observed, and the slope of that line denotes the specific rate (\u00b5) of the epidemic spreading. Note that COVID-19 has exhibited a wide range of spreading rates in different countries (from ~0.3 to ~0.9 day -1 ). Note also that \u00b5 is related to the doubling time (t d ), often reported in population and epidemiological studies, by the equation t d =Ln 2/ \u00b5. Therefore, ranges of doubling times between 0.75 and 2.45 days are observed just among these three regional cases. Different exponential stages, perfectly distinguishable by their exhibition of different slopes, may be observed within the same time series. For instance, the outbreak in New York City ( Figure 1B ; blue symbols) was first described by an extremely high slope (\u00b5 o = 0.926 day -1 ). However, after a series of measures adopted in New York City by the federal, state, and local governments, the specific growth rate of the epidemics fell to \u00b5 = 0.308 day -1 . The last point is extremely important, since two drastically different slopes can be observed before and after a package of adequate measures within the same territory. In addition, two localities that experienced similar initial specific epidemic rates may exhibit dramatically different evolutions as a function of the initial response of government and society ( Figure 1C,D) . For instance, while the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and South Korea exhibited practically equal \u00b5 o values, the Italian outbreak has maintained the same growth rate throughout 20 days, while South Korea has set an example by effectively and rapidly lowering the specific epidemic rate to nearly 0 in just two weeks.",

Similarly, asymptomatic patients are only removed from the pool of susceptibles after full recovery. Note that, in the current version of our model, asymptomatic patients are not considered part of the population capable of transmitting COVID-19, despite recently reported evidence that suggests that asymptomatic subjects (or minimally symptomatic patients) may exhibit similar viral loads [20] to those of symptomatic patients and may be active transmitters of the disease [3,21]. The number of deceased patients was calculated as 0.023 of those infected 14 days before. This mortality percentage (case fatality rate) lies within the range reported in recent literature for COVID-19 [8,22-24]. The time lapse of 14 days between the onset of disease and death was statistically estimated by Linton et al. in a recent report [25]. The straightforward implementation of the model in Excel (Supplemental Excel File 1), using the set of parameters described before, allows the calculation of all populations (I s, X s , X as , D, R, and P s ) every hour. Note that this model enables the description of the progressive exhaustion of the epidemic, as expected by the progressive depletion of the susceptible population. Next, we discuss criteria for selection of the values of \u00b5 o based on the initial behavior of the COVID-19 Pandemic at different urban areas around the globe.",

            "text": "particular locality is straightforward and only requires (a) the calculation of the population and the surface area of the urban area, and (b) the selection of a t d value (time to doubling the name of infections). Note that our model is formulated in terms of values of the specific epidemic growth rate (\u00b5 o for the onset of the epidemic and \u00b5 for later times). However, expressing the specific epidemic rate in terms of doubling time (t d =Ln 2/\u00b5) is more practical and simpler to communicate and understand. The selection of \u00b5 o (t d ) can be easily done by fitting the prediction to the initial set of reported cases of infection. In our experience, four to five reliable data points are needed for a good fit. For instance, Figure 2 shows the predicted trend of the pandemic in New York City during the first 22 days of March, 2020. In addition, we set (Dd/Dd ref =1.90), since the population density in New York City is 1.90-fold higher than that in Madrid. A value of t d = 2.25 was also set for the first week of this simulation. Later, at day 7 (March 7), we reset the value of t d to 3.75 to reflect the modification of the slope of the local epidemic event in New York (Figure 1d), due to the implemented measures of containment. Based on this exercise, we foresee that this simple modeling tool can be used to evaluate the efficacy of containment strategies. In other words, the value of \u00b5 o required in the simulation to adapt the predicted data to the actual trend of the local epidemic provides an indicator of the local rate of spreading of the pandemic. Therefore, the differences between \u00b5 o before and after interventions provide a real-time quantitative measure of the effectiveness of that set of measures. This can be extremely useful when assessing the efficacy of control of epidemics. For example, for New York City, this simple model states that the set of containment measures adopted during the first week of March in NY City diminished the specific rate of the epidemic by increasing the doubling time of infections from a value of 2.25 to 3.75 days.",

For example, our simulations predict that, in absence of more aggressive containment measures, the peak of infections in New York City will be reached by April 10, 2010 (twenty days after the submission of this manuscript), after reaching the unprecedented value of 11,000 new cases per day, and a cumulative number of 1 \u00d7 10 6 citizens infected. We are currently following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Monterrey, the second most industrialized city in M\u00e9xico and the third most populated. Monterrey has a similar demographic density to that of Madrid (Dd/Dd ref =0.95). In addition, we set t d = 2.5, based on proper fitting to the first set of official values of COVID-19 infected announced for Monterrey by the local authorities from March 15 to March 18, 2020. Remarkably, the simulation results have accurately predicted the three subsequent actual values, as officially reported from March 19 to March 21.",
