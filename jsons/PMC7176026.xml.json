On 7 January 2020, Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative virus, which belongs to the same virus family of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that outbroke also in South China in 2002\u20132003 [2]. The 2019-nCoV spread rapidly across most regions in mainland China after 17 January 2020 and leaded to over 7000 infectious cases at the end of January (Fig. 1a). The number of the first-month cumulative cases of the 2019-CoV has exceeded the total number of the SARS cases in 2003, suggesting this novel virus has stronger infectivity than the SARS virus. Since about 23 Jan 2020, the Chinese Government has taken strong measures to prohibit the virus\u2019s transmission, such as warning citizens from going outdoors, temporarily suspending the public transport between some big cities, and even taking quarantine for the main infected city. These unprecedented measures were expected to effectively stop the virus transmission and buy necessary time to deploy medical resources to the affected area. At the same time, considering the virus having exported to other countries, including Thailand [3], Japan [4], South Korea [5] and the United States of America [6], the WHO has made decision on identifying the 2019-nCoV outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [7].\n",

Releasing the epidemic information in a timely and accurate way is extremely important for the anti-epidemic response of the public. The authentic and transparent information could have prohibited the spread of the 2019-nCoV at the early stage. The other cause is the lacking of scientific diagnostic criterion for the 2019-nCoV. Rapid developing exact testing techniques for a novel virus is very difficult. In fact, the symptoms of the 2019-nCoV are highly similar to those of flu. This aggravated the hardship of diagnosis. The last but not the least, the lacking of an epidemic warning and prediction system lost the opportunity to prohibit the epidemic spread at the initial stage.",

            "text": "Under the background of the ongoing 2019-nCoV transmission, the epidemiological survey is extremely important for stopping transmission by tracing the infectious pathways and particularly identifying the super spreaders. But, the outbreak of the 2019-CoV is just coincident with the large-scale population migration during the most important traditional Chinese festival, which exacerbated the spreading of virus and simultaneously greatly increased the difficulty of the epidemiological investigation. So, on the other hand, monitoring and predicting the evolution of the epidemic becomes extremely meaningful for the decision making against the public health crisis. Mathematical modelling has gained more attention and awareness in epidemiology and the medical sciences [8]\u2013[10]. One family of these models is the dynamical epidemic model called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model [11]. The SIR model originated from the study of the plague almost one hundred years ago [12]. Tremendous advance has been achieved in dynamical epidemic model since mid-20th century [13]. In recent decades, some realistic factors influencing the epidemic transmission were included in the classic SIR model, such as the model considering the incubation stage [14], the SEIRS model considering the population age and the population exposed to epidemic [15], and the SIS model including birth and death of the susceptible [16]. Some dynamical models were also designed for specific epidemic. For example, the dynamical models were designed to simulate spreading of HIV, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [2], [17]\u2013[19]. As the development of new methods, the complex network and machining learning were combined with the dynamical model and created a promising direction of the epidemic prediction [20], [21].",

As was mentioned in the above, the family of the SIR model has developed complex model to considering more detailed classes of individuals, such as the exposed class and the protection class [11]. In general, the more realistic the model is, the more precisive prediction the model can make. But, the model considering more realistic factors needs more data to define additional parameters. On the other hand, some effort has also been made on simplified model. For example, the well-known logistic equation was used of as the two-compartment \u201cS-I\u201d (Susceptible -Infectious) model, which can be further included some stochastic processes in the modelling of SARS [22]. The above-mentioned researches prove that the SIR-family models at different complex levels can well capture the basic mechanism of the epidemic transmission.",

The prediction intervals of the infective number and its inflection point, as well as those of the cumulative infected cases and the fading-out time of the epidemic, were presented.

After the inflection point, the number of the infected cases will decrease rapidly until the epidemic has faded out in late April to late June. On the whole, the 2019-nCoV epidemic may persist three to five months. From Fig. 3c and Table 2, the final cumulative infected case will reach about 140,000 varying in the interval of 76,000-230,000, which reflects three-fold difference between the most optimized measure and the worst one. That is to say, the above prediction intervals are strongly determined by the anti-epidemic measures and the medical-service level against the 2019nCoV.",

Although the 2019-nCoV outbreak can be traced back to late December 2019 (perhaps earlier), the systematically released epidemiological data is only available after 11 January 2020, among which the reasonability of the data before 18 January 2020 is still unconvinced. So, until the authors finished this work, the reliable data only covers no more than two weeks, which may lead to large uncertainty in the early prediction of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. But, the effort of the early prediction is still meaningful. Mathematical models of different complexities have been proved to be effective in predicting the evolution of epidemic outbreak. But, the more complex the structure of the model, the more parameters are needed to be determined. Under the condition of lacking epidemiological data, it is hard to objectively determine all the parameters. Too many unknown parameters will bring large uncertainties in the model prediction. Based on the point, this work formulated a simplified SIR model with the least parameters, i.e., the infection rate and the removal rate, to reduce the uncertainty as much as possible. The model shows good ability in hindcasting the spreading of SARS in 2003. So, we further applied this model to the 2019-nCoV.",

The predictions are supposed to be a helpful guide to the decision making in coping with the ongoing 2019-nCoV transmission in China. The strictness of the current quarantine measures and infection control precautions employed by Chinese Government is historically unprecedented. So, as predicted by this work, the control measures should pay more attention to the medical-service aspects, such as accelerating the diagnostic speed and enhancing the hospitalization capacity. If all the above efforts get the cumulative infected cases down to below about 80,000 until late February (Fig. 3c), the severity of the 2019-nCoV may be controlled at the relatively low level finally. The sensitivity of the simplified-model prediction to the parameters also emphasized the importance of the openness and transparency in releasing the data relevant to the public health. As the progressing of the 2019-nCoV, more epidemiological data will be available to verify and revise this early prediction of the 2019-nCoV.",
