Concomitantly, the emergence of novel, zoonotic pathogens is rapidly increasing as well as the bacterial resistance to antibiotics [1, 2]. In fact, several of the major health organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified infectious diseases and the increasing resistance to antibiotics as a foremost global concern [3]. The increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics threatens to make some infections untreatable and poses a major threat to modern health care as several medical procedures are dependent on effective antibiotics. Actions are needed to promote the understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which pathogens cause disease and how they modulate their host\u2019s cellular machinery to escape immune surveillance. Equally important is the development of new treatment alternatives to antibiotics [4].",

At the same time, host proteins such as immunoglobulins, proteins of the complement system and antimicrobial proteins together with cells from the host\u2019s adaptive and innate immune system, bind to bacterial surfaces and effector proteins to neutralize bacteria and prevent infection. This dynamic interplay between host and pathogen partly depends on the formation of host\u2013pathogen protein\u2013protein interactions (HP-PPIs) [5, 6]. Typically, HP-PPIs are dynamic and are under strong evolutionary pressure [7] to a point where the diversity can inundate the host immune system [8, 9]. Structural characterization of HP-PPIs has the potential to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of infection as well as to provide new targets for drug and vaccine development [10, 11]. Integrative structural biology combining information from several complementary approaches within structural biology and biological mass spectrometry has the potential to improve the characterization of HP-PPIs (see \u201cINFO BOX 1\u201d) [12].\n",

            "text": "Successful integrative structural biology approaches for the characterization of HP-PPI networks typically requires multi-tiered information. For example, large-scale mapping of binary interspecies protein\u2013protein interactions is important to outline the degree of interconnectivity between proteins within a network. Conversely, generation of multiple HP-PPI networks between different species will support comparative studies to promote generalized conclusions about pathogen-specific mechanisms [15\u201317] and common themes of interaction between different pathogen types [6, 18\u201321]. Such information will clarify whether particular bacterial proteins bind to more than one human protein to form larger host\u2013pathogen protein\u2013protein complexes (HP-PPC); or if certain human proteins are frequently targeted by several proteins from one or many bacterial pathogens [16]. Another important aspect is the knowledge of the protein\u2013protein binding site to, for example, differentiate between direct and indirect protein interactions. In this context, highly resolved information of protein binding interfaces across species-specific HP-PPI networks has the potential to uncover underlying evolutionary conserved interaction patterns that can be further exploited for the development of new therapeutic strategies [22]. Lastly, structural information of the individual protein components as well as intact interspecies protein complexes is required to determine the structural\u2013functional relationship of the interactions. The recent development and application of several mass spectrometry (MS)-based protein interaction analysis strategies [23] together with the \u2018resolution revolution\u2019 of cryoEM [24\u201326] offers new possibilities to map, characterize and functionally annotate HP-PPI networks. In this review, we highlight some recent technological developments in affinity-purification (AP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) applied together with electron cryo-tomography (cryoET) to demonstrate how these approaches have provided novel and distinct information of bacteria\u2013human HP-PPI networks (Fig. 1). We also propose how the increasing maturity of AP-MS, XL-MS, single-particle cryoEM and cryoET is likely to advance integrative structural biology and modeling approaches.",

The map is composed of over 220 high-confidence HP-PPI between streptococcal virulence factors and human plasma and saliva proteins. The results demonstrated that S. pyogenes forms a highly interconnected HP-PPI network with human proteins, which can dynamically change in different bacterial\u2013host microenvironments. Furthermore, the use of different S. pyogenes serotypes and their isogenic mutants revealed that the M1-protein, the main surface-attached virulence factor of S. pyogenes, interacts with many human proteins forming a large HP-PPC. These efforts provide relevant information for future vaccine development programs for S. pyogenes by identifying the localization of opsonizing antibodies to specific regions of the M1-protein. In another paper, Penn et al. performed an AP-MS study to identify protein interactions formed between secreted Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins and proteins from human macrophages [29]. The study generated a global map of 187 high-confidence HP-PPI from 34 secreted Mtb proteins. This enabled the identification of a specific interaction between the probable conserved lipoprotein LpqN (a secreted Mtb virulence factor) and the ubiquitin ligase CBL. The identification of the interaction between CBL and LpqN infers a host defense mechanism limiting the growth of Mtb in macrophages. In a third study, Mirrashidi et al. [17] used inclusion membrane proteins (Inc) from Chlamydia trachomatis to generate an extensive HP-PPI network composed of 354 high-confidence lnc\u2013human interactions. The study identified several proteins and pathways known to be modulated during infection and revealed cellular processes possibly modulated by C. trachomatis. Importantly, several of these HP-PPIs were found to be conserved also in viruses, such as HIV [17, 27].",

Additionally, information regarding protein interaction sites and direct and indirect protein binding within HP-PPIs provides critically important information to establish the organization and topology of the HP-PPI networks and the arising HP-PPCs [28, 39]. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) provides valuable information about the structural characteristics of a protein or protein complex (Fig. 2, and \u201cINFO BOX 3\u201d). The reactive sides of the cross-linker reagents are separated by a fixed distance. Thus, identification of cross-linked peptides provides information of the physical proximity of protein secondary structure elements, subunits and domains. This distance can then be used for molecular modelling of protein complexes [39\u201341]. Recent improvements in the chemical cross-linking reagents, mass spectrometers and database search algorithms [42] have improved the analysis of cross-linked peptides in complex biological samples such as cell lysates [43]. Advanced XL-MS techniques could also play an important role in integrative structural biology [14] as highlighted in the examples below.",

Biotin-aspartate proline-PIR n-hydroxyphthalimide (BDP-NHP) was used to crosslink A. baumannii with human cells, followed by tryptic digestion of the cross-linked proteins and subsequent MS analysis. This cross-linking experiment using human lung epithelial cells identified the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) as a virulence factor. OmpA was found to bind to a desmosomal protein providing evidence for a novel mechanism of how A. baumannii enables epithelial intrusion and cell invasion. In more recent work, Hauri et al. developed a novel XL-MS workflow termed targeted chemical cross-linking (TX-MS). TX-MS relies on a combination of chemical cross-linking, high-resolution mass spectrometry and high-accuracy protein structure modeling [39]. TX-MS was used to construct a high-resolution interspecies quaternary model of the S. pyogenes M1\u2013human protein complex identified in a previous AP-MS study [28], as discussed briefly above. The model explains how the repeat regions of the streptococcal M1-protein bind to several plasma proteins along its length to prevent phagocytosis, inhibit complement activation and to secure nutrients [49]. At the same time, the model also explains how S. pyogenes masks its conserved and vulnerable surface epitopes in the binding interfaces with human proteins [50].",

Addition of cross-linkers to proteins stabilizes their interactions in native conditions, thus providing valuable information on their dynamics and flexible regions. Moreover, covalent bond formation between interacting proteins leads to capture of weak or transient interactions thereby reducing non-specific background [43, 45]. The work using TX-MS revealed that the full structure of the M1-protein is engaged in protein interactions, as TX-MS could confidently locate protein binding interfaces within the repeat regions [39]. Interestingly, the model also proposed that some of the plasma proteins are interacting with other M1-attached human plasma proteins. This observation demonstrates that TX-MS has the capability to determine protein interaction site and the ability to distinguish between direct and indirect protein binding [39]. A highly interesting prospect of additional XL-MS studies is the comparative HP-PPI network protein binding site analysis across species. Such a comparative study could uncover underlying evolutionary conserved interaction patterns [22]. Still, it is clear that additional work is required to further address the quadratic expansion of the computational search space and the unequal fragmentation efficiency of two cross-linked peptides, which typically makes it difficult to unambiguously identify the XL-peptides in complex samples. These developments would allow to more routinely integrate XL-MS workflows in integrative structural biology approaches.",

However, even when combined with structural modeling, XL-MS and AP-MS are unable to provide high-quality, atomic resolution structural information of the individual proteins in a complex or the structure of the complete HP-PPC. For studies where high-resolution structural information is required, XL-MS can be combined with single-particle cryoEM (see \u201cINFO BOX 4\u201d) as described for several large, multicomponent human protein complexes as recently reviewed [41, 51].

Such studies show the potential for equal ones on bacteria\u2013human interspecies PPCs targeting structures at the host\u2013pathogen interface.

For example, Nans et al. [68] cultivated human cells directly on sample grids, infected them with C. trachomatis elementary bodies (EBs) released naturally from co-cultured infected cells and visualized them by cryoET. In this way, a system was developed to visualize snapshots of Chlamydial EBs under physiological conditions during early stage cell entry, including the type III secretion system (T3SS) needles in direct contact with the host plasma membrane [68]. Nans et al. also determined the structure of the T3SS in a host-free environment and in contact with host plasma membrane followed by sub-tomogram averaging, discerning several conformational differences between these two states. Nans et al., thus, revealed that the T3SS acts like a \u2018molecular syringe\u2019 during effector protein release into the host-cell cytoplasm [66]. Jasnin et al. used the same approach by cultivating epithelial kidney cells directly on the sample grids, infecting them with L. monocytogenes and visualizing the infected cells by cryoET, followed by tomogram interpretation by an automatic segmentation algorithm developed specifically for the tracking of actin filaments [70]. The work by Jasnin et al. proposed a model of actin nucleation and comet tail assembly on the bacterial surface with the bacterial ActA and the human Arp2/3 [71] being the key players, leading to simultaneous polymerization of multiple tangential actin filaments [67, 72].",

Structural molecular modeling has changed in recent years by the introduction of low-resolution modeling techniques and fragment-based movers. These techniques use segments of known protein structures to ensure that perturbations to the model simulation adhere to biochemical constraints that determines the three-dimensional structure of the protein [71] (see \u201cINFO BOX 5\u201d). This revolution and the increase of understanding it provides have supported the design of enzymes [73], the creation of new protein topologies [74] and the design of self-assembling proteins [75]. Protein\u2013protein docking and flexible-backbone protein\u2013protein docking can now be carried out routinely as long as experimental structures or high-quality homology models exist [76]. Additionally, molecular modeling in conjunction with XL-MS has allowed us to provide detailed structures of bacteria\u2013human HP-PPCs [39].",

            "text": "In this review, we have showcased different techniques involved in understanding different tiers in HP-PPI. Integrative approaches involving AP-MS, XL-MS, cryoEM and structural modelling could provide combined knowledge and valuable insights into the process of infection. AP-MS identifies interacting protein pairs; however, it fails to identify the interacting peptides and domains between proteins. AP-MS coupled with XL-MS would not only identify interacting proteins, but also stabilize transient interactions and identify amino acid pairs between the interacting proteins. Complementing AP-MS and XL-MS with single-particle cryoEM would provide additional structural information on the complete HP-PPC. Both XL-MS and single-particle cryoEM require small sample amounts and both can be applied to heterogeneous samples. For larger protein complexes, where the local resolution in cryoEM maps can vary considerably with usually highly defined core regions and more poorly resolved densities towards the edges, XL-MS can help in resolving the structure of these edges by providing the needed distance constraints between proteins or their domains [51]. However, whereas it is difficult to determine via XL-MS whether a cross-link between peptides arises from a more or less populated protein (complex) conformation, this information can be determined via single-particle cryoEM by classification particles and derived volumes during data processing [51, 98]. Other limitations of XL-MS relate to possible unequal fragmentation efficiency of two cross-linked peptides and identification of sparse networks of cross-linked distance constraints. Incorporating structural modeling approaches such as de novo modeling, comparative modeling, and protein\u2013protein docking will play an important role in overcoming these limitations. TX-MS [39] as mentioned above is a successful example of such combination, as it overcomes the aforementioned limitations and enables the structural modeling of large macromolecular assemblies with dense networks of distance constraints. The usefulness of XL-MS to structural, proteome-wide studies will further be pushed by recent developments in cross-linkers [43] and structural modeling and docking approaches [14, 39, 43]. It can further be anticipated that integrative structural approaches in medical microbiology will be beneficial for the design of novel therapeutic approaches. For example, the emerging field of structure-based design of vaccines\u2014also referred to as structural vaccinology\u2014has recently started to deliver new vaccine antigens [99]. Structural vaccinology aims at optimizing protective B-cell epitopes using a combination of X-ray, electron microscopy, mass spectrometry and computational approaches [100]. Pioneering studies have shown that HP-PPI between human proteins and bacterial proteins influences protective antibody responses [101, 102], which is of importance for rational design of cross-protective antigens [103]. Furthermore, efficient physical and structural epitope mapping abilities using for example XL-MS, HDX-MS, X-ray crystallography and more recently cryoEM for large antigens provides essential information for antigen engineering to guide vaccine design and optimization [100]. Such information in combination with human B-cell repertoire sequence analysis represents a promising way forward for investigations regarding the structural basis for epitope immunodominance and the use of such information in vaccine design [99]. Further technological developments in this area will enable us to enhance our understanding of the structural basis for HP-PPI and immunogenicity to further improve vaccine efficiency and potentially other targeted treatment strategies [104].",
