            "text": "The recent success that the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service has had in 2003 and 2004 of reversing the steadily increasing trend in Class 1 recalls is welcomed. In agreement with those statistics are the FSIS microbiological results for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef, which also showed a decrease in 2003. But there is much work to be done in food safety and much more to achieve. It is imperative that while addressing food-safety issues, we should understand the role that the environmental microbiology, public health epidemiology, aerobiology, molecular microbial ecology, occupational health, industrial processes, municipal water quality, and animal health have on food safety. Although it is a difficult task, a concerted effort by industry, academic, and governmental researchers can accomplish the goal. Here we discuss the future directions and applications in the distribution and spread of foodborne hazards, methods for microbial detection and differentiation, intervention strategies for farm pathogen reduction, targeting waste at animal production sites, considerations on antimicrobial resistance, food-safety storage and preparation strategies, food irradiation, new and emerging food-safety hazards, and quantitative microbial food-safety risk assessment. Although this does not comprise an exhaustive list of food-safety issues, these are the areas that, we think, require considerable attention by researchers. Not only we need to strive to improve food safety through new strategies, processes, and applications, but we also need to be flexible and observant to readily handle the new and emerging food-safety problems, whether they are within our borders or global. At present, the United States has one of the safest food-safety systems in place. However, although this is not a time for complacency, our research endeavors should be designed to keep pace with the food-safety needs of the future.

Foods can be contaminated with microbial pathogens and toxins at all points of the foodproduction cycle from preharvest through postharvest as well as within the home. Pathogens that can be deadly to humans are found to reside within food animals. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the outbreaks of foodborne diseases for which the etiology and transmission vehicle could be traced have resulted from foods of animal origin about 50% of the time (1) . The CDC estimates that foodborne disease causes approx 76 million illness cases in the United States each year. This results in approx 325,000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths each year. The costs in terms of overall medical expenses and lost wage-productivity are estimated to be between These FSIS results are very promising and the contamination trend appears to be in the right direction. But let us make no mistake that there is plenty to do in food safety. The recent trends shown above by FSIS are just a beginning. We definitely want to see recall rates hovering around 0%, and contamination rates at zero. Are these rates achievable? Can these rates be maintained?",

Given the multiple routes through which humans can contaminate the environment as well as be exposed to microbial pathogens, it is impossible or illogical to separate food-safety principles from the environmental quality or from the public health principles (Fig. 2) . It is also extremely critical to emphasize that to address food-safety issues holistically, a clear understanding of environmental microbiology, public health epidemiology, aerobiology, molecular microbial ecology, occupational health, industrial processes, municipal water quality, and animal health are needed (Fig. 3) . Otherwise, the solutions that are devised and the outcomes that are achieved can be seriously compromised. In the mean time however, we need to be adamant about learning more about host-pathogen interactions, distribution and spread of foodborne hazards, including handling the glut of manure buildup at animal production facilities, antimicrobial resistance involvement from prescription and on-farm abuse, and the abuse because of the incorporation of antibiotics in a myriad of household products available in the open market. We must also strive to improve and simplify verification tests, improve decontamination strategies and on-farm pathogen reduction strategies, be fully prepared to handle the new and emerging food-safety hazards, and be more analytical in addressing microbial food-safety issues. Last but not least we need to come up with a good plan to impart and implement food-safety storage and preparation strategies for the producer, retailer, food service operation, and the consumer. Some of these areas will be highlighted in this chapter. These areas as well as others have been discussed in detail in other recent publications (18, 19) .",

            "text": "The scientific community, the regulatory community, and the general public need to realize that is impossible and incorrect to cubbyhole food safety separately from environmental quality and public health. As shown in Fig. 2 , the organisms that are of concern to food safety find their origins in the environment, in farm animals, and in humans. Organisms are transmitted between humans, animals, the environment, and foods through air, water, soil, and equipment routes. Multiple disciplines and factors ultimately impact the safety and quality of foods (Fig. 3) . Although the transmission of hepatitis A infection may be decreased by vaccinating food-service workers, there are other routes of hepatitis A transmission that are extremely difficult to control. The safety in food-service operations can depend highly on the incoming food ingredients. Enteric viruses such as hepatitis A (HAV) can get into the food chain through contaminated irrigation water or wash water. In 1988, 202 cases of HAV were reported in one outbreak, and upon investigation it was traced back to commercially distributed lettuce. Contamination in the lettuce was found to be prior to local distribution (20) . In 2003, approx 555 people were infected with HAV at one restaurant, resulting in three deaths, through contaminated green onions which was traced back to contamination in the distribution system or during growing, harvesting, packing, or cooling (21) . Pathogens such as L. monocytogenes find ecological niches (to survive) within food-processing facilities in locations such as within drains and on food-handling equipment. Thus, the design, the material, and the ability to clean and disinfect the equipment have significant impacts on our ability to control this pathogen.",

Improved surveillance and tracking studies will lead to the identification of many of these pathogens that could be classified as emerging or re-emerging pathogens. Studies on the biotic and abiotic factors that influence the emergence of these pathogens will gain increased attention worldwide. The influence of global climate change on infectious disease trends will be another intensively studied area. The fate of newly identified pathogens in air, water, and soil would need to be explained to identify the environmental management strategies to control these pathogens. Improved waste-handling and waste-treatment systems for both municipal and animal wastes have to be developed to minimize or eliminate infections from pathogens such as SARS. Water treatment technologies incorporating UV disinfection, reverse osmosis, chlorine dioxide, and ozone need to be evaluated for specific applications on the farm and in postharvest processing applications.",

In 1999, the United States food industry performed as many as 144 million microbiological tests (22) . These numbers were 23% higher than what was observed in the preceding year. It must be emphasized that though the number of microbiological tests were indeed significant, only approx 26% of these tests were pathogen-specific tests. Regulatory pressures on the food industry such as the \"zero tolerance\" of pathogens like L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 have been responsible for the increase in tests to detect these organisms (23) . Even though there are commercial diagnostic assays to detect many of the key foodborne bacterial pathogens, there are no commercial kits to detect enteric viruses in food. This is an unfortunate situation given that viruses account for over 65% of known foodborne illnesses in humans. A variety of food items such as fresh produce, frosted bakery products, infected food-handlers, and shellfish are known to have transmitted viral infections to the human population (24) (25) (26) . Methods are urgently needed to process the food samples to extract the viruses out of the samples, concentrate the viruses, and ultimately detect the viruses without interference from the sample matrix. Current methods to detect enteric viruses using tissue culture are extremely time-consuming, labor intensive, and are consequently expensive. Qualitative molecular methods that provide only a cursory positive/negative result for the presence of enteric viruses in food may have only limited applicability given the potential to detect noninfectious virus particles. There have been a few reports on the detection of infectious virus particles using molecular methods. These methods need to be rigorously tested in multiple laboratories and on different types of samples to prove their ultimate utility for the food industry.",

Molecular methods will find increasing applications especially for microbial risk-assessment studies. The USDA and the FDA must deal with the issue of re-emerging organisms and have the responsibility of identifying and prioritizing the critical microbial contaminants in foods. Using indicator organisms in lieu of specific pathogens can be fraught with limitations. Although spectacular breakthroughs have been achieved in terms of biosensors for pathogen detection, much work still remains to be done with respect to the first step in detecting pathogens, namely sample processing. The processing has to be extremely efficient at recovering small numbers of organisms on food samples but also has to be amenable to downstream applications such as molecular assays (i.e., PCR, quantitative PCR, or biosensors) without any interference from the sample matrix. PCR is ideally suited for the food industry. It may provide more effective product quality monitoring and prevent costly recalls. Even though molecular methods will not totally replace the conventional microbiological assays, the future molecular methods can allow for faster, more sensitive, and more characterization capabilities. This will entail an increased awareness of QA/QC as it pertains to molecular methods and a trained workforce that can keep up with the rapidly changing technologies.",

The second way uses genotypic or other molecular methods (27) . Many of the best discriminatory methods, like pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), take days to conduct. The CDC supported PulseNet which relies on PFGE fingerprinting is considered the golden standard for epidemiological tracking. In the future, methods to differentiate bacteria strains will be developed that are rapid, reproducible, and hopefully automated. The current 16S rDNA-based fingerprinting method (termed Riboprinting), though automated and sophisticated, is still far from being as discriminatory as PFGE. It is critical to improve and devise new discriminatory tools. Methods based on multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) show promise. This method has been able to distinguish among E. coli O157:H7 isolates that appear homogeneous by PFGE (28, 29) , and distinguished between Bacillus anthracis isolates (30) (31) (32) . It is the new methodologies, such as this one, that will help us to move forward into the future with more discriminatory results and rapid response time. In the final analysis, however, it will be the regulatory and liability pressures that will ultimately dictate whether or not, and to what extent the food industry will adopt molecular methods (23).",

New additional food-safety interventions should be developed to decrease pathogen contamination during livestock and poultry production. A number of products have been developed using the strategy known as competitive exclusion (CE). Competitive exclusion is the process of using microbial cultures to out compete pathogenic bacteria. A defined culture having 29 nonpathogenic bacteria was developed that decreased the prevalence of Salmonella in chicks (33, 34) . Another CE product was developed using an undefined culture that decreased the prevalence of Salmonella in poultry (35) . Currently, a CE culture to be used in swine is under development. In vitro studies using a continuous flow culture in chemostats demonstrated that the culture designated RPCF decreased Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis, E. coli F-18, and E. coli O157:H7 within 24 h post-inoculation, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was reduced by 48 h postinoculation (36) . The RPCF culture reduced Salmonella serovar Choleraesuis colonization in early-weaned pigs (37) . The use of RPCF to protect suckling neonatal pigs against infection with enterotoxigenic E. coli resulted in significant reduction of E. coli compared to the controls (38) . During field trials, the RPCF culture reduced the disease associated with enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli in weaned pigs (39) . The RPCF culture has shown successful results in decreasing disease caused by E. coli in neonatal and weaned pigs. This disease can be fatal and the mortality rate can reach high levels (40) . Antibiotics have traditionally been used as a treatment of choice. But over time, E. coli have become more resistant to antibiotics and CE is a potential alternative treatment. When developed properly, it could become the method of choice for reducing the disease associated with enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli. More work in these and other animal species should be investigated using the CE strategy.",

Some of these strategies use heating, pelleting, chemical treatments, or a combination of treatments. The use of chlorate treatment is a very interesting strategy. The reduction of chlorate by nitrate reductase (NR) increases the death rates of E. coli and Salmonella (41) . Salmonella and E. coli possess respiratory NR activity (42) that can reduce chlorate to cytotoxic chlorite (43) , while most gastrointestinal anaerobes lack NR and are not affected (44) . Nitrate adaptation in broilers produced a higher reduction of Salmonella Typhimurium following chlorate treatment (45) . Chlorate treatment via oral gavage of weaned pigs resulted in reduced cecal concentrations of Salmonella (44) , and reduced E. coli O157:H7 in the pig gut (46) . E. coli O157:H7 in sheep can also be reduced by chlorate supplementation (47, 48) . This is an example of a unique chemical treatment that affects pathogens with little or no affect on other gastrointestinal anaerobes and is worthy of further pursuit.",

However, others believe that overprescription and abuse of antibiotics to treat human illnesses have caused the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens (57) . Antimicrobial resistance has become a highly controversial topic in both animal husbandry and clinical medicine. Even though much is known about the role of gene transfer mechanisms in the development of antibiotic resistance, it is extremely important to clearly understand the molecular mechanisms that signal the involvement of horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria. Once the mechanisms and magnitude of resistance gene transfer are clearly understood and quantified, strategies can be sought to reduce the potential for dissemination of these genes. Also, the role of host signals in the development of antibioticresistant bacteria in humans and animals warrants further study.",

The use of antimicrobials such as triclosan in hand and dish soaps, deodorant soaps, hand creams, shower gels, surgical scrubs, facial cleaners, sanitizers, coatings and gloves may very well be the suspect because of the possibility of introducing antimicrobial resistance. It was thought that triclosan was a nonspecific biocide that disrupted cell membranes, thereby leaving the bacteria unable to proliferate (59) . However, recent research has shown that triclosan acts at specific targets (60, 61) . The basis of triclosan's activity is to inhibit fatty-acid biosynthesis (62) . Triclosan is a substrate of a multidrug efflux pump in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and triclosan will select for itself as well as for multidrug-resistance in bacteria (63) . Therefore, it is quite clear that triclosan should not be in every product possible, as it is now. Especially, it should not be used in surgical scrubs. In the future, chemicals like triclosan should not find their way into consumer products; it is expected that sooner or later triclosan will be removed from the glut of products on the market that now contain it. However, there is a high-dollar commercial investment in using triclosan or chemicals like it in consumer products. This allows the tag of \"antibacterial\" to be used, which is worth a lot to the companies that manufacture these products.",

Over 40 different countries have approved the use of food irradiation. The United States has the most number of approvals for the use of irradiation on foods.

Achieving low doses of irradiation is extremely important to eliminate minor traces of microbial contamination and retain the sensory qualities of specific food items. In conjunction with low-dose irradiation capabilities, dosimeters that can measure such low doses are urgently required. There is a need to develop irradiation protocols for achieving uniform dose distribution on uniquely shaped foods, such as apples, cantaloupes, tomatoes, and heterogeneously shaped packages. Standardized protocols are needed for dosimeter placement and product presentation to the E-beam to achieve minimal min : max ratios for efficient pathogen kill. Studies are also needed to identify the irradiation dose for different food-matrix properties that can eliminate viral pathogens on fruits and vegetables that are minimally processed and are highly vulnerable to fecal contamination (74).",

In 1997, a group from Denmark published an exhaustive study on the issue (75) . Seyforth and coworkers concluded that although Salmonella Typhimurium isolated from animals and humans showed antimicrobial resistance, multiple-resistance was most often acquired outside of Denmark (75) . Then Aarestrup and Wegener stated in a review that \"There is an urgent need to implement strategies for prudent use of antibiotics in food animal production to prevent further increases in the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne human pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter and E. coli\" ( [76] , p. 639). However, their concerns immediately became reality. A variant of Salmonella Typhimurium strain DT104, resistant to quinolones, was responsible for the death of two people in 1998 (77) . This bacterium was traced back to a single Danish swine herd that had been treated with quinolones (78) . This episode clearly documents the spread of zoonotic (the transmission of infections under normal conditions from animals to humans) bacteria from animals to humans. The threat of emerging resistant pathogenic bacteria is real. We must be focused with a close watch on the potential for this to happen anywhere in the world (79).",

Observations from captive cervids provide evidence of lateral transmission of CWD, which is similar to scrapie, but the details concerning the transmission of CWD still remain to be determined. The CWD agent has been demonstrated to be in various tissues suggesting that the CWD agent may be shed through the alimentary tract, and shedding probably precedes the onset of the clinical disease in both deer and elk (85) . However, CWD is like BSE because of the long incubation periods and subtle early clinical signs. There have been no cases reported of human prion disease associated with CWD, whereas human exposure to the BSE agent has resulted in over one hundred deaths due to vCJD (85) . The prevalence of CWD has been steadily increasing, and therefore, we need to carefully assess the potential risk that CWD exposure may pose to humans. Recently, the sheep scrapie agent was used to experimentally induce spongiform encephalopathy in elk, and could not be distinguished from CWD of elk (86) .",
