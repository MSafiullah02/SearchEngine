Exposure has been shown to cause many adverse health effects including allergic, toxic, and infectious responses [1], [2], [3]. Aerosol transmission is known to play an important role in observed airborne microbial infections. Studies indicate that large scale outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were mainly the result of airborne exposure routes [4], [5]. Viruses are detected in air samples collected from hospital rooms [6], [7] and also in human breath [8], [9]. A study indicated that there was an approximately 23% possibility of influenza virus infections in people wearing surgical and N95 respiratory masks [10]. Therefore, development of efficient air control technology is important in combating inhalation-related diseases.",

However, recent research has demonstrated that some microorganisms are capable of colonizing the air filter surface in heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems (HVAC) [11], [12], [13], and the organic or inorganic materials deposited on the filter surface can contribute to microbial growth. Air filters contaminated by microorganisms lead to the release of microorganisms from the filter surface [14], and the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by microbial metabolism [11], [12]. Biologically contaminated filter could pose a significant health hazard through reaerosolizing opportunistic pathogenic or allergenic aerosols [15].

            "text": "Even though carbon nanotube filters have been extensively studied for water purification, there are only a few reports in the literature on carbon nanotube use for air purification. Viswanathan et al. [27] presented the first investigation of the use of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as high efficient, airborne particulate filter media. High filtration efficiencies were achieved from films of MWCNTs deposited onto cellulose fiber filters. The MWCNT-coated filters exhibited low pressure drops and better filter quality than cellulose filters. Park and Lee [28] constructed a metal MWCNT filter in which carbon nanotubes were grown directly on the micron-sized metallic fibers of the air filter using the thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The metal MWCNT filter had higher filtration efficiency than conventional filters without a significant decrease in pressure. Karwa and Tatarcuk [29] studied an enhancement in aerosol filtration by synthesizing carbon nanostructures including nanofibers within nickel sintered metal microfibrous matrices/filter media. Their study showed that carbon nanostructure synthesis led to significant improvement in the performance of filter media with large initial pore size because the pore diameters did not reduce significantly with synthesis. Yildiz and Bradford [30] prepared novel filters by drawing aligned CNTs sheets and embedding them between polypropylene melt-blown nonwoven fabrics using calendaring. The filters were prepared with an increasing number of CNT sheets. The filtration performance of the novel filters showed that when the number of CNTs layers increased, the filtration efficiency increased dramatically, while the pressure drop also increased. Guan and Yao [31] investigated the removal efficiencies of CNT filters for a collection of aerosolized biological and non-biological particles. In their preparation of the CNT filters, a predetermined volume of CNT suspension with a certain concentration was uniformly filtered through the membrane support. The removal efficiencies for aerosols and bacteria were shown to increase with increased loadings of CNTs regardless of membrane supports and pore size tested. Xu and Yao [32] fabricated a single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) filter with CNT solution, and investigated its anti-bacterial efficacy with CNT loading. Their results revealed that particle types and CNT loading had greater effects on anti-bacterial efficacy than other membrane types and pore sizes tested. Park et al. [33] reported that a MWCNT-deposited glass fiber filter showed increased particle filtration efficiency and antibacterial activity. In the fabrication of CNT filters, samples of glass fiber filter media were catalytically activated with iron (Fe) nanoparticles generated by the spark discharge method. The catalytically activated filter samples were placed in a thermal CVD reactor in which MWCNT fibers were vertically grown on the activated spots after acetylene (C2H2) gas was carried into the reactor.",

In addition, the durability of a CNT filter made by the CVD process can be degraded in the high temperature environment associated with the CVD process. In this paper, we suggest an aerosol process of fabricating a CNT filter at atmospheric pressure and temperature using the electro-aerodynamic deposition (EAD) method, the details of which were introduced in our previous study [34]. In the EAD method, CNTs were aerosolized, electrically charged, and injected through a nozzle, where an external electric field was applied. The charged CNTs were vertically deposited on the glass fiber filter media even at a low flow velocity. Using CNT coated filter samples, virus aerosol filtration and anti-viral tests were carried out using the aerosol number counting technique and the plaque counting method, respectively.",

After compressed air was passed through a clean air supply consisting of an oil trap, diffusion dryer, and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, the particle-free compressed air entered a Collison type atomizer (9302, TSI Inc., USA), which was filled with 9 ml of de-ionized water and 1 ml of 1% CNT solution. The aerosol flow rate was controlled by a rotameter. Dry, clean air at 3 lpm formed a high-velocity jet through an orifice in the atomizer. The pressure drop from this jet drew the CNT solution up through a tube. The solution was then broken up into droplets by the high-velocity air jet. The resultant larger droplets impinged on an impactor, while the smaller droplets made no contact and formed an aerosol that exited through an outlet. The aerosolized CNTs were passed through a diffusion dryer for water removal and a neutralizer (Soft X-ray charger 4530, HCT, Korea) to induce a Boltzmann charge distribution (Fig. 1(A)).",

When the applied voltage was less than 300 V, CNT particles would not deposit on the substrate. However, at a potential of 300 V, CNTs started to deposit on the substrate and the CNT deposition area decreased. The calculated results were in good agreement with those predicted by the following equation [34]:(8)WpW\u22450.96npeCcV3\u03c0\u03bcUdph-0.41where W is the nozzle width, U is the flow velocity at the nozzle, V is the voltage applied to the substrate, h is the distance between the nozzle and the substrate, and Wp is the radius of the coated region.",

When the charger was not operated, there were no CNTs observed on the substrate, regardless of the voltage applied (Fig. 3(a)). When charged CNTs were flowing toward the substrate where no electric field was applied, several particles were deposited as shown in Fig. 3(b), which was caused by an image force between the CNTs and the substrate (Eq. (3)). When the charged CNTs were delivered to a substrate of opposite polarity, many of them were successfully deposited on the surface (Fig. 3(c)). Fig. 3(d) shows a frontal view of the deposited CNTs. Note that the CNTs were vertically aligned. This phenomenon was due to characteristics of the charged CNTs. According to Keblinski et al. [42], CNTs have higher charge concentration on both tube ends than in the central part. Therefore, when they landed on the substrate the end of each CNT that was closer to the substrate than the other end was attracted to the substrate, resulting in the standing posture of the tubes.",

Conventionally, wet coating by solution process has been used to deposit any functional materials to a filter, followed by a drying process with heated air flow. CNT air filter also can be fabricated by CNT growth on a filter medium via CVD process [33], where a tube furnace need to be used. However, using heated air flow or tube furnace often causes deformation of filter materials. Since our methodology does not include any solution process and high temperature treatment on the filter, possible chances of filter deformation are avoided.",

CNT filters had better filtration efficiencies for aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 than medium air filters with a negligible decrease in pressure. The particle filtration efficiency was increased to 33.3% in the most penetration particle size zone (100 nm) and the antiviral efficiency of the CNT filter was 92% when the coating areal density was 1.5 \u00d7 109\n #/cm2. The susceptibility constant of virus to CNTs was 0.2 cm2/\u03bcg. These CNT filters will be useful for both filtration and inactivation of viral aerosols.",
