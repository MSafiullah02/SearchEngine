It was recognized that contraction of influenza sometimes produced beneficial effects in leukemic patients. These early observations predate the formal demonstration that influenza was, in fact, caused by a virus. In the 1950s clinical studies were initiated in which a range of human viruses was administered to cancer patients, including HBV, West Nile virus, adenovirus, and mumps virus. The clinical experience with this approach has been discussed in several excellent and extensive historic reviews [1 -3] .",

This has allowed the design of new and potentially more efficacious oncolytic viruses, and even arming the replicative oncolytic viruses with therapeutic transgenes. In parallel, there has been a continued and expanding interest in the use of nonhuman viruses for oncolytic virus therapy. There are two main reasons for this interest. The first is the absence of immunity against non-human viruses in the human population. This may provide the viral oncolytic agent a head start by allowing the therapeutic virus to be administered without the risk that the pre-existing neutralizing immunity inactivates the vector and frustrates transduction of tumor cells. The other reason is that many nonhuman viruses have not been associated with diseases in humans. In addition, recombinant DNA technology offers the prospect of overcoming limitations imposed by viral pathogenicity in humans.",

Firstly, during the preclinical phase, there are the hazards associated with handling the viruses in the preclinical evaluation program. The level of containment required for such activities is dependent on the biosafety classification of the virus that is handled. The guidelines that currently exist for such \"contained use\" activities require the use of dedicated laboratories. Such guidelines are standardized and widely adopted.",

            "text": "In clinical applications, there are two distinct categories of risks. The first and most visible is the category of risk associated with the (potential) hazard to the patient who receives the viruses as (part of the) therapy. Here the procedure for a proper assessment of the risks and (potential) benefits should not differ greatly from more conventional medical interventions. However, in addition to the patient's risk, the fact that the therapeutic agent is infectious and can potentially be shed from the patient bears the possibility of horizontal transfer of the viral therapeutic agent [4, 5] . The latter risk category in the clinical use of viruses is summarized by the term \"environmental risk\". For the use of oncolytic viruses, the environmental risk encompasses the chance and severity of undesirable effects that result from the clinical use of the therapeutic viruses on humans other than the patient (viz. any person not willfully exposed to the viral therapeutic agent, such as medical personnel, the patient's relatives, or other patients), or on susceptible animals (e.g. pet animals, livestock, poultry, or wildlife). The variety of potential environmental hazards and undesirable consequences is wide, and ranges from pathological effects (e.g. outbreaks of infectious disease on a short time scale to tumor-formation upon exposure to murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) on a long-time scale) to economic consequences (e.g. the risk of a country losing its Aujeszky's disease-free status if suid herpesvirus 1 would be shed from a patient.) The use of oncolytic viruses therefore requires containment procedures to reduce such transfer and minimize the risks associated with it. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no general guidance exists for estimating and evaluating the environmental risks associated with the clinical use of non-human viruses as therapeutic agent, for example in cancer therapy. The absence of guidelines for assessing the environmental risks seems at odds with the specific regulation that is in place for instance in xenotransplantation [6] .",

Although the authors are not aware of any examples of outbreaks of viruses as a consequence of intentional exposure of humans, recent history has provided several examples of spontaneous cross-species transfer and establishment in a new host. Examples are discussed in detail elsewhere [5] and include, for example, the recent H1N1 \"Swine Flu\" influenza A virus [9] , the SARS-corona virus [10] and in the more distant past, the HIV lentiviruses [11, 12] .",

Although there is a wide consensus on a moratorium on xenotransplantation, there seems to be no specific guidance for developing clinical strategies involving the deliberate administration of non-human viruses with a therapeutic intent. The formulation of guidelines to ensure appropriate assessment of risk to the patient and the environment may be suitable to date. Such guidelines could come either as \"points to consider\" for the investigators or as more formal regulation. In this regard it is relevant to recognize that many of the viruses that are being developed are not by definition \"genetically modified organisms\" (GMOs). Hence their use may not demand the environmental risk assessments that are part of the formal national or international (e.g. European) GMO regulations. Also, the EMEA ICH Considerations document \"Oncolytic viruses\" (EMEA/CHMP/ICH/607698/2008) does not provide guidance relating the management of environmental risks: while it advises to consider barrier contraception for the duration of the clinical trial as a standard precaution to prevent person-to-person transmission, it does not address other environmental risks.

The \"Medium\" category was used as a start point in the classification, and the assignment was scaled up or down based on factors that could strongly affect the relative environmental risk. The most important of these are included in Table 1 . None of the viruses were classified in the \"Very High\" relative environmental risk category, whereas three viruses are classified as \"High\". Furthermore, two viruses are scored as \"Negligible\". The latter concerns the Autographa californica baculovirus and the canarypox virus. Three viruses are placed in the \"High\" risk category: Maraba virus, Seneca Valley virus (SVV), and Murine Leukemia virus (MuLV). The proposed use of the viruses classified as \"High\" in the relative environmental risk scoring and a brief summary of their biosafety aspects are presented in the following sections. A more comprehensive description of all non-human viruses developed for clinical use, the research activities herewith, and a motivation for the classification has been described elsewhere [7] .",

            "text": "MuLV-based replication-competent retroviral (RCR) vectors have been shown to yield efficient gene delivery both in cell culture and in vivo. Logg and colleagues [23] described the development of the RCR vector that harbors an internal ribosome entry site-transgene (GFP) cassette positioned between the ENV gene and the LTR. This vector replicates and efficiently expresses a transgene in culture and in solid tumor models in vivo. Analyses of high molecular weight DNA harvested from the tumor, spleen, lung, kidney, liver, and heart revealed the presence of the full-length GFP transgene only in the tumor samples, and not in any of the non-tumor tissues. These data show that spread of the RCR vector appears confined to the tumor tissue. Also Tai and colleagues [24, 25] showed that transduction by (RCR) vectors is efficient, tumor-selective, and persistent. A single dose of RCR vector expressing the CD prodrug-activating gene, followed by a single cycle of a 5-FC, inhibited growth of pre-established primary gliomas in mice without apparent damage to adjacent normal brain tissue. The authors also reported efficient RCR vector-mediated transduction of malignant gliomas in immunocompetent Fisher rats [26] .",

Although MuLV is known to induce thymic T lymphoma in newborn mice, it is not pathogenic in adult mice [27] . For human studies amphotropic MuLV is required. Initial studies of amphotropic MuLV in rhesus monkeys could find no evidence of pathology in infected animals over a 3-year observation period, despite severe immune suppression at the time of infection and the administration of high doses of replication-competent MuLV [28, 29] . A subsequent study, however, revealed that amphotropic replication-competent MuLV can be oncogenic in primates. In this study 3 of 10 rhesus monkeys that received bone-marrow cells infected with replication-competent amphotropic MuLV developed T-cell lymphoma [30, 31] . These results suggest that while MuLV is potentially oncogenic in primates, the presence of a normal, functioning immune system reduces oncogenicity to a large extent.",

The use of replication-competent MuLV-derived vectors in cancer gene therapy is a novel approach. Despite the fact that MuLV is presumably inefficiently transferred horizontally in humans, the uncertainties surrounding the effects of a replication-competent amphotropic MuLV led us to cautiously classify it as \"High\" with respect to the relative environmental risk score.",

Rather than defining a set of strict goals and binding criteria, the authors suggest formulating and listing points to consider in such environmental risk assessment. Such a list could be used for defining practical procedures that facilitate the application while achieving acceptable risk levels. It will be the joint responsibility of authorities and investigators to define such procedures and to find solutions that assist research that can make oncolytic virus therapy a powerful approach for combating cancer.",
