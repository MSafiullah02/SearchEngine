At the third day, the rRT-PCR confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A day later, chloroquine was started because of that. His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis. Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 became negative. The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days.",

He had become ill on February 29, 2020, a total of 4 days after he had flown to Cali from Madrid, Spain, on March 2, 2020, where he was living since January 7, 2020. He began self-medication with acetaminophen on March 3, 2020. After his arrival at the Cali airport, he travelled by car to Buga, where he stayed until admission to our hospital. He denied contact in Spain with people presenting respiratory symptoms. At the hospital, he was strictly isolated. His close contacts were investigated by the public health authorities and were ruled out.",
