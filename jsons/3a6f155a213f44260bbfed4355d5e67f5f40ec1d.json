However, recent pandemia of SARS-CoV-2 has put these proteins at the center of attention, as this virus has been shown to exploit ACE2 protein to enter cells. Clear difference in the response of affected patients to this virus has urged researchers to find the molecular basis and pathophysiology of the cell response to this virus. Different levels of expression and function of ACE proteins, underlying disorders, consumption of certain medications and the existence of certain genomic variants within ACE genes are possible explanations for the observed difference in the response of individuals to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has its homologue, ACE2 discovered in 2000 as a ACE related caroxypeptidase not inhibited by captopril (1, 2) . ACE2 was firstly shown to be expressed in the kidneys of both the normotensive and the spontaneously hypertensive rat strains (3) . Subsequent studies demonstrated down-regulation of renal ACE2 in three different models of hypertension (4) . Moreover, circulating and cardiac levels of angiotensin II (AT-II) were shown to increase in the ACE2-null mice. ACE2 is the principal pathway for Ang-(1-7) formation from AT-II (Ang-1-8), protecting against excessive activation of AT1 receptor in the heart tissues, However, newer findings suggested that ACE2 can be an important element in the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (5) . Following these studies, ACE and ACE2 focused the attention of researchers for their contribution in diverse human disorders. Recently, the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) outbreak which has affected people all over the world has further highlighted the role of ACE2. This virus has about 80% sequence identity with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) and 96% sequence identity to a bat coronavirus. Most remarkably, SARS-COV-2 was shown to utilize the similar cell entry receptor ACE2 as SARS-CoV (6, 7). A recent study has shown that the ACE2-binding pocket for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is almost identical to this one of SARS-CoV RBD. Structural protein modeling led to identification of amino acid residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD that critical in ACE2 binding. Notably, most of these residues are either highly conserved or have comparable side chain chemical properties with the SARS-CoV RBD.",

            "text": "This similarity of the structure and amino acid sequence stimulated intensive debate on the convergent evolution of these viruses RBDs under a pressure of enhanced binding to ACE2 (8) . ACE2 has been shown to be expressed as a membrane bound protein in several human tissues such as lung, intestine, heart and kidney. The surface expression of this protein on was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f demonstrated on ciliated bronchial cells and on the lung alveolar epithelial cells but also in endothelial cells, which was stated a noticeable discovery (9) . Moreover, a recent in silico analysis of RNA-seq profiles verified expression of ACE2 in the mucosa of oral cavity (10) . Figure 1 shows the molecular mechanisms initiated after SARS-CoVs entry into the cells and the significance of ACE and ACE2 in these processes. Then, ACE converts AT-I to AT-II. Finally, ACE2 cleaves AT-II to produce AT-(1-7). AT-II can bind with AT1R to initiate inflammation and fibrosis in lung tissue. However, binding of AT-(1-7) with MasR inhibits this process. SARS-CoVs exploits ACE2 for their entrance into the cells. A transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 has a crucial role in activation of the fusion of a virus with cell membrane. Moreover, the Furin protease which is proconvertase physiologically required to activate proteins in the Golgi apparatus mediates proteolysis of the spike protein S2 subunit, an unique feature for SARS-CoV-2 (11) . ACE2 levels are decreased in SARS-CoV infected cells leading to increase in AT-II and decrease in AT- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f levels. Based on receptor effects of these proteins mediated by AT1R and MasR, these two alterations have synergic effects on induction of lung fibrosis. Moreover, AT-II has a role in degradation of ACE2 through ubiquitination (12) . SARS-CoVs also enhance expression levels of miR-200c-3p and miR-429 in the infected cells, both of them being regarded as ACE2 targeting miRNAs (13, 14) (ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme, ACEi: ACE inhibitor, AT: angiotensinogen, ARB: Angiotensin II receptor blocker).",

Moreover, injecting SARS-CoV spike into mice has led to down-regulation of ACE2, thus aggravating the lung injury (16, 17) . Consequently, ACE2 functions as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV entrance but also confers a protective mechanism against lung injury (18) . Based on these investigations, level of expression of ACE2 is an important factor in the SARS-CoV infection. Thus, comorbid conditions that influence expression of this protein might affect severity of disease.

Expression level of ACE2 has importance in severity of infection with SARS-COV-2 and the extent of lung injury(18). Most recently, human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) has been shown to inhibit growth of SARS-CoV-2 and interrupt early stages of infections with this virus(91). the abundance of genetic modifying factors in determination of ACE2 levels, it is advisable to create a risk predictive panel to determine propensity for severe infection of individual. Whole genome sequencing of the patients' samples is the best method for identification of genetic variants that determine severity of the disorder. If a few genes were recognized that have a significant impact on the variability of COVID-19 course, a genetic test for coronavirus susceptibility could be simple to make, cheap and accurate. However, much more genes could be involved in this process. Perhaps a complex regulatory pattern of genetic expression which is involved in the physiology of the lung and upper respiratory tract shape in addition to ACE2 might contribute in this disorder.Assessment of association between ACE proteins expression and human disorders has implications in health consequences after recovery from the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection.This would be a next important issue after extinguishing of the pandemia.Hypertension is reported to be the most common comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infection (92), and the ACE protein is a target for ACE-inhibitors which are used in the treatment of hypertension to ultimately decrease the amount of Ang II. Some polymorphisms in ACE gene are reported to influence the efficacy of these inhibitors among them is the homozygous ACE haplotypes which lead to faster response to ramipril(61). The expression and function of the ACE itself are affected by its polymorphisms which are associated with susceptibility to different diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus(93). Notably, polymorphisms in both ACE and ACE2 are important in the regulation of the ACE2 expression(94,95).",

Exploration of the role of these factors can lead to design of appropriate therapeutic modalities based on the personalized risks. Such personalized approach is expected to be more effective. Exploitation of the next generation sequencing methods at both genomic and transcriptomic levels would be a practical strategy in this regard. In conclusion, the observed differences in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be attributed to several genetic factors, comorbidities and administration of medical regimens that modulate expression of ACE proteins.

Accordingly, among the top 38 eQTLs in ACE2, the strongest expression positive eQTL is more prevalent in East Asian females(100). We also suggest epigenetic regulation by the potential miRNAs targeting on ACE2 transcripts. The results of the Targetscan database(www.targetscan.org) list miR-200c-3p and miR-429 among the most prominent miRNAs J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that target ACE2. Up-regulation of miR-200c-3p is induced by a viral infection which leads to the downregulation of ACE2 (13). Also, miR-421 is proved to downregulate ACE2 Interestingly, we have analyzed the well-studied I/D in ACE in Iranian patients with multiple sclerosis and reported association between this polymorphism and response to Interferon-\u03b2 treatment (71). Thus, ACE/ ACE2 polymorphisms not only can predispose individuals to diverse diseases, but also they can modulate response of patients to therapeutic options. Both activities have implications on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease course. Another research era might be the identification of the difference between ACE/ACE2 expression levels and their regulating factors, such as the mentioned eQTL and miRNAs, between patients with severe and mild symptoms in different ethnic groups to find the possible effect of ethnicity, gender and the period of the disease on the ACE/ACE2",

AT-II can bind with AT1R to initiate inflammation and fibrosis in lung tissue. However, binding of AT-(1-7) with MasR inhibits this process. SARS-CoVs exploits ACE2 for their entrance into the cells. A transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 has a crucial role in activation of the fusion of a virus with cell membrane. Moreover, the Furin protease which is proconvertase physiologically required to activate proteins in the Golgi apparatus mediates proteolysis of the spike protein S2 subunit, an unique feature for SARS-CoV-2.",
