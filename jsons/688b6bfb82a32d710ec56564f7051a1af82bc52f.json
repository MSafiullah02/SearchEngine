            "text": "Despite being similar in structure, functioning, and size, viral pathogens enjoy very different, usually well-defined ways of life. They occupy their hosts for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV), which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes (airborne, via direct physical contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to the viral load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and virulence define further aspects of pathogenic lifestyles. To survive, pathogens must infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. On these grounds, what can be said about the reproductive success of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results of the author and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens. A mathematical framework is presented that models intra-and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of numerically simulated fitness landscapes. The models involve differential and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.",

Most of the literature studies particular infections (Murillo et al. 2013; Fraser et al. 2014) and often either focuses on between- (Fraser et al. 2007) or on within-host dynamics (Alizon et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2012; Handel et al. 2014 ). However, some articles follow a more general approach, e.g., combine inter-and intra-host dynamics (Coombs et al. 2007; Luciani and Alizon 2009; Pepin et al. 2010) , discuss involved challenges (Handel and Rohani 2015; Gog et al. 2015; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2015) , or sketch a unified perspective (Grenfell et al. 2004; Lange and Ferguson 2009; Weitz et al. 2019) . Two of the last three are of particular interest here, covering the viral phylodynamics of Grenfell et al. (2004) and an epidemiological approach suggested by Lange and Ferguson (2009) . As being far from obvious, one would like to know if the two approaches lead to the same conclusions.",

In particular, we try to relate the so-called static patterns of Grenfell et al. (2004) and the infection types of Lange and Ferguson (2009) . Besides mathematical structure, a crucial part of any modeling framework is the involved parameters, which we intend to compare and re-identify for the two approaches. We expect that, eventually, this will lead to a similar classification of viruses. Hereby the focus will be on virulent ones, although we do not explicitly vary virulence in our models.

To take this into account, we study viral replication within and between hosts. Yet, when pursuing the minimalistic approach of Lange and Ferguson (2009) , we only follow one particular pathogen at a time, which-determined by its temporal load-spreads in the contact neighborhood of one infected individual. That is, we do not consider multiple infections and thus ignore the interaction between them (Alizon et al. 2013; Gulbudak and Weitz 2019; Clay and Rudolf 2019) . This may characterize our approach as rather crude and impose implicit assumptions on the modeled system such as low incidence and a homogeneous host population. Less virulent viruses are excluded by introducing a stopping condition in the within-host model, which will restrict the follow-up period to be less than 2 years. Following the methods used by Lange and Ferguson (2009) , we employ differentialand integral equations, networks, stochastic models, and numerical simulations. Based on the various parameter sets that are involved, we investigate conditions that maximize the reproductive success of the virus, formulated by a version of the basic reproduction number. The maxima are obtained by systematically testing parameter combinations, also at the boundary of the considered parameter regions.",

Epidemiological aspects such as transmission and inter-host environment are less important in their approach. This is different in the approach by Lange and Ferguson (2009) , where infectious diseases are classified into three types (cf. Fig. 2 ). Even if the classification is based on antigenic variation (being either A: medium, B: high, or C: low), epidemiological aspects such as the host-contact rate and the transmission mode are revealed to be closely related. Each infection type corresponds to a 54 Page 4 of 23 A. Lange Figure 2A in Grenfell et al. (2004) . It indicates the locations of the five static patterns (lying on a parabola) in the pathogen parameter space of Grenfell et al.

Furthermore, the figure indicates the monotonic behavior of the strength of selection (blue) and the viral abundance (red) with respect to the immune pressure (y-axis) (Color Figure Online) certain range of contact/transmission rates (A: low, B: medium, C: high). Depending on that range, each infection type shows a distinct fitness landscape (between-host reproduction) over pathogen space (Fig. 2, top row) .

Despite wellknown limitations of R 0 as a fitness measure, referring to the findings of adaptive dynamics (Mylius and Diekmann 1995; Metz et al. 2008; Dieckmann 2002 ) but also to the definition of R 0 (Diekmann et al. 1990; Grassly and Fraser 2006; Li et al. 2011) , the proposed R 0 will be sufficient for recovering the static patterns of Grenfell Lange and Ferguson (2009) .

The bottom row shows the corresponding between-host characteristics: total virus count ( v), duration of infection (D), and the initial peak load ( v\u00d7 D for the 1st peak), respectively. The maxima of these surfaces define three evolutionary strategies (or lifestyles, as we also refer to them). While having the maxima at the same location in pathogen space, the surfaces of the top and bottom rows are similar too (Color Figure Online Systematically, for all viruses represented by our pathogen parameter space, we simulate the within-host evolution and calculate the average load over time v(t). The load curve is used to define a time-dependent transmission rate, \u03b2(v(t)). Based on this rate, the between-host dynamics is simulated for a totally susceptible host-contact network. The total number of infected individuals then determines the basic reproduction number R 0 , our model for viral fitness (Color Figure Online The intra-host model involves cells for viral replication and an adaptive immune response. Via mutations, viral replication includes a stochastic element. The simulation outcome represents the load of a particular mutable virus in an average host.

A particular fraction of contacts (\u03bb, specific to the infection) transmits the virus from one to another host. To quantify the reproductive fitness of the virus, we study the transmission network only for the contact neighborhood of one initially infected host. For this neighborhood, consisting entirely of susceptibles at the beginning, we determine the changing number of susceptibles over time and calculate the basic reproduction number (2), defined similarly to an effective reproductive number suggested for time-depending transmission rates and systematically varying numbers of susceptibles (Grassly and Fraser 2006) . We do not explicitly consider intermediate hosts or vectors here, but neither we exclude them; mass-action can provide an effective description (Lange 2016) . Different from a simple mass-action model, the mathematical formalism describing a network incorporates a cliquishness parameter \u03d5, which quantifies the number of contacts between members of the considered network-neighborhood. Including a network structure is crucial. Network contacts help spreading the virus through the neighborhood and, as a consequence, effectively lower the number of susceptibles in that neighborhood. Being similar to the screening of charges in a solvent (Debye and H\u00fcckel 1923) , we refer to this phenomenon as screening effect (cf. Fig. 5) ; in ecology the effect is also known as self-shading (Messinger and Ostling 2013) . The phenomenon cannot be modeled via a modified mass-action coupling alone, yet screening seems to be necessary for obtaining type C infections [cf. Fig. 4 in Lange and Ferguson (2009) ].",

In fact, we do not know how to tackle invasion problems in such a general setting, where one would have to consider several invasions based on unknown dynamics and possibly not even at equilibrium. For now, we can only test which set of strains reproduces best in a given environment. We propose that network effects and the initial period after infection are of particular importance (Georgieva et al. 2019 ), leading to a classification similar to the one by Grenfell et al.

The dependence on the transmissibility \u03b2 is captured by a third dimension, erected over pathogen space (\u03b4, \u03c1). Numerical simulations for our (relatively large) parameter space, which cover the within-host dynamics and the transmission network, are hugely time-consuming. They restrict the parameter pairs (\u03c7 , \u03b1)-feasible to consider-to be a small number (= 6 \u00d7 4). 2 Instead of enlarging this number by increasing the computation power/time, we decided to proceed by locally extrapolating the simulation results. That is, we blur the image points of the mapping (18) by \"enlarging\" these points, so that they become colored circles. At the same time we decrease the intensity of their unique color toward outer radii. As a consequence, colors of nearby circles mix according to their red-green-blue content, and we obtain colored patches in pathogen space where the color content corresponds to a unique (\u03c7 , \u03b1)-parameter combination. The result of that extrapolation is shown in Fig. 10a .",

It is not difficult to explain how these relations, Eqs. (20), have been obtained. The infectiousness bound \u03b1 (occurring only in Eqs. 20a and b) selects between the types A and B: if low (i.e., if high loads are required for transmission), type A (i.e., FLI) is favored; if high (i.e., if low viral loads are sufficient), type B (i.e., STI) is favored. According to (19), both these types are favored by rather low transmissibility \u03b2. Cross-immunity \u03c7 (scaled blue; cf. Fig. 9a ) favors two patches in pathogen space (cf. Fig. 10a ). The one with high transmissibility \u03b2 corresponds to type C (i.e., ChD), the other we do not really know. It might represent vector-born infections (Lange and Ferguson 2009 ), but it is not type C. Fortunately, this does not matter as in Fig. 11a the blue color is switched off at low transmissibility \u03b2 (cf. Eq. 20c). If \u03b1, \u03c7 are kept fixed, as in Sect. 4.1, only the transmissibility selects the infection type in (20): A for low-, C for high-, and hence, B for medium \u03b2-values.",

(iv) and (v) would involve elongated time scales, possibly multiple generations of hosts where co-evolution becomes important (Levin 1996; Rehermann 2009 ). In fact, (iv) has recently been investigated in the limiting case of vanishing thresholds (v 0 = 0) by Viljoen et al. (2018) , which resulted in a smaller variety of infection types. When including virulence (v) or other interaction with the host-environment, one must reconsider the fitness definition via R 0 (Dieckmann 2002) and possibly also investigate coexisting strains and re-infection of partially immune hosts (Georgieva et al. 2019) . Not only to support (iii), the models would have to be more realistic, especially at the intra-host and transmission level, regarding the involved microbiological processes. But also at the inter-host level, one may try to employ dynamical and more structured networks to improve our understanding of viral lifestyles and evolution.",
