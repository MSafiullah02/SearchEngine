            "text": "The Eukaryotic EndoU ribonuclease family is a novel protein class which includes several enzymes that share significant sequence homology with the founding member XendoU (Snijder et al., 2003, Renzi et al., 2006). This family includes several proteins from a variety of organisms that range from viruses to humans. For example, Xenopus XendoU is a uridylate-specific, divalent cation-dependent enzyme that produces molecules with 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate ends, a unique characteristic of this particular class of RNases involved in generating U16 and U86 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) through the cleavage of pre-mRNAs encoded within introns (Laneve et al., 2003, Gioia et al., 2005, Renzi et al., 2006). The human Endou, known as PP11, has been recently characterized as a member of the XendoU family. Despite its annotated function as a putative serine protease, human Endou has endoribonuclease activity with placental tissue specificity. The dysregulated expression of PP11 in tumor tissues suggests that it may be associated with carcinogenesis (Inaba et al., 1980). Recent studies also demonstrate that both Xenopus XendoU and human Endou play important roles in cellular processes, including the regulation of ER structure, RNA degradation and cell survival (Schwarz and Blower, 2014, Poe et al., 2014). Nsp15 (NendoU), a viral ortholog of XendoU, is unique to the nidovirus family of ssRNA viruses, which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Laneve et al., 2003, Bhardwaj et al., 2004, Gioia et al., 2005). Nsp15 is a component of the replicase\u2013transcriptase complex that plays important roles in virus replication and transcription (Ivanov et al., 2004). Like XendoU, Nsp15 has endoribonuclease activity which can cleave RNA, either upstream or downstream of uridylates, at GUU or GU to produce molecules with 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate ends (Ivanov et al., 2004). NendoU has also been postulated to suppress host immune responses (Ricagno et al., 2006) and facilitate apoptosis in cells expressing the mitochondrial antiviral signaling adapter protein that induces host antiviral responses (Lei et al., 2009).",

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has become a powerful vertebrate model system for the in vivo study of gene expression. However, the molecular implications of endonuclease, polyU-specific C (endouC) are not well known. Nor has the spatiotemporal pattern of the endouC gene been reported. Therefore, in the present work, a phylogenic tree of EndouC among known vertebrate species was elucidated. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of endouC in zebrafish embryos at different developmental stages was also analyzed.",

When the deduced amino acid residues of EndouA/-B/-C were aligned with the counterpart of other vertebrates, a highly conserved XendoU domain was identified at residues 28\u2013290 (Fig. 1\n). This result supported the conclusion proposed by Laneve et al. (2003) and Renzi et al. (2006) who demonstrated that Endou family proteins have a highly conserved XendoU domain (residues 131\u2013285) with homologs from eukaryotes. Moreover, this XendoU domain was speculated to have endoribonucleolytic activity (Renzi et al., 2006). Using Singal-blast software, we found that all human three Endou isoforms, mouse two Endou isoforms, and zebrafish EndouA and EndouC contain a signal peptide at N-terminus, while Xenopus Xendou, chicken Endou and zebrafish EndouB did not (Fig. 1). Interestingly, three zebrafish Endou proteins lacked the Somatomedin B (SMB) and SMB-like domain otherwise conserved among vertebrate Endou proteins (Fig. 1).",
