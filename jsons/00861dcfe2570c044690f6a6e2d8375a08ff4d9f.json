For this reason, whole blood assay approaches have been favored as they appear to be superior to cellular assays in predicting efficacy of drug exposures. For example, the efficacious doses of several COX inhibitors produce total in vivo plasma concentrations that are greater than the whole blood COX-2 IC 80 .

In one study, an ID 50 oral meloxicam dose of 1.36 mg/kg/day (two doses, q8 h) was determined against zymosan that was used to induce inflammatory markers in the peritoneum (Engelhardt, 1996) . Single-dose ED 50 values for intraperitoneal (IP) meloxicam in mice have also been reported for writhing induced by acetic acid (2.6-6.5 mg/kg) (Santos et al., 1998; Miranda et al., 2006) . If only modest differences (\u22642-fold) in plasma concentrations related to dosing route and formulation are assumed, s.c. meloxicam in these dose ranges is expected to inhibit COX-2 as the whole blood IC 50 (230-250 nM) would be achieved for approximately 12 h at only 1.6 mg/kg s.c. (Fig 2A) . While we acknowledge some important assumptions in this retrospective analysis, it is proposed that known effective meloxicam doses for mice are reflective of a correlation between our observed plasma drug exposures and published whole blood inhibition constants. Pharmacokinetic simulation further suggests that to maintain analgesia, more than one dose per 24 h may be required (Fig. 2) . It should be noted that these projections may only apply to the formulation studied here. The alternative of giving a higher dose once a day would lead to high C max values that may be tolerated for acute treatment, but may also contribute to increased risk of adverse events. Simulation of the top reported s.c. dose of 20 mg/kg suggests the time above the whole blood IC 50 would be extended to~18 h assuming that the absorption rate remains unchanged at such a high dose (Leach et al., 2012) . Subcutaneous doses of 3 and 20 mg/kg delivered q12 h are estimated to cover the IC 50 (12 h/dose) and IC 80 (11 h/dose), respectively (Fig. 2B) . Alternatively, the development of new formulations that modestly delay absorption without affecting the onset of action could allow for daily dosing.

Admittedly, our conclusions weigh heavily on the use of human whole blood COX-2 inhibition, although COX-2 is a highly conserved enzyme across species. As a wide range of s.c. meloxicam doses are currently used in practice, we propose researchers consider modifying their preferred meloxicam dosing to q12 h if the increase in animal handling is tolerated. It is anticipated that any s.c. inflammatory response from a short-term increased dosing frequency would be minimal as no pathologic lesions were noted in the skin with daily s.c. administration over a 3-day period. While an efficacy endpoint was not included in our studies, these findings have highlighted a potential deficiency in the way meloxicam analgesia is provided to mice.
