Recommendation system, which aims at addressing this problem by providing personalized items to each user, has become an indispensable element of many web applications. Recently, top-N recommendation based on implicit feedback has attracted much research interest since implicit feedback is much more abundant and easier to collect in practice [10]. Among the various recommendation methods, collaborative filtering (CF) stands out to show good performance, with the assumption that similar users tend to share similar preferences [11, 17]. However, the performance of CF models are often hindered by the data sparsity and cold-start issues [3].",

It assumes that people tend to spread their interests to their social connections and focuses on combing social information with user-item interactions for better item recommendations [19]. In conventional social recommenders [8, 12], social relations are typically modeled as an ensemble term or a regularization based on the matrix factorization (MF). There also exists hybrid models which collectively factorize the user-item interaction matrix and trust matrix [4]. Recently, researchers also designed more advanced neural models for social recommendation and showed state-of-the-art performance [1, 2, 18]. E.g., [1] models both aspect-level and friend-level differences for social recommendation by attention mechanism and memory network. Although the above models are effective, we argue that they have three common limitations: Firstly, they typically incorporate all social relations into user preference modeling, ignoring the fact that users may have totally opposite tastes on specific items. Secondly, they often learn a single vectorized representation for each user, which is insufficient to reveal user\u2019s complex interests to both items and friends. Finally, none of them have fully considered the neighborhood information in both domains.\n",

As users involve in two heterogeneous graphs, we model the user-item interactions and social relations simultaneously instead of directly incorporating social information into user embeddings. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1, we propose to model the two kinds of relations as interaction vector (e.g., \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\varvec{r}_{11}$$\\end{document}) and social vector (e.g., \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\varvec{s}_{12}$$\\end{document}) respectively. Then in the metric space, each user can be regarded as being translated to both mulitple item-aware points by the interaction vectors or to multiple social-aware points by the social vectors, which results in a much finer-grained model. In addition, from the perspective of CF, each user-item pair can be seen as being related by their respective neighboring items and users. Analogously, two users in the social domain are also connected by their neighboring friends. Therefore, we model the two kinds of relation vectors by neighborhood interactions, in which neighborhood-based representations in the two domains are generated by two carefully designed dual GATs [16]. Then they are fed into two corresponding MLPs to model the complex interactions between two neighborhoods as relation vectors. Finally, the two relation modeling parts are incorporated into a joint model to mutually enhance each other.",

[5] further extends MF to a neural architecture to model the implicit feedback as complex nonlinear user-item interactions.

[22] extends BPR with the assumption that users tend to rank items consumed by their friends over those unobserved. [4] collectively factorizes the rating matrix and trust matrix to share the same user latent vectors. However, the above MF-based methods could only capture linear information encoded in social network, so several recent studies proposed to learn more complex features using deep neural networks [1, 2, 18]. Authors in [2] designed a NSCR model based on NCF [5] to model the social relations as a graph regularization. To learn non-linear features of each user from social relations, [18] presented a deep model which substitutes the user latent modelling part of PMF with DNN. A newly proposed method SAMN [1] leveraged attention-based memory network to model both aspect-level and friend-level differences for social recommendation.\n",

In addition, all with neural architectures, SAMN and our model significantly outperform NeuMF and LRML.LRML consistently show superior performances to all other non-social methods as it also adopts the idea of translating users to multiple item-aware representations.

In order to validate whether our proposed RML-DGATs model could mitigate the cold-start issue, we conduct experiments on different sparsity levels of user groups. Firstly, similar to [21], users are categorized into four groups according to the number of interacted items they have in the training set (i.e. <6, 6\u201320, 21\u201335, >35) and we term users in the first group as cold-start users. Then we take LRML as a baseline for its competitive performance as a non-social model. Results of the two methods on the two datasets w.r.t. NDCG@10 are shown in Fig. 4 (Results on HR@10 show similar trends). Compared with LRML, RML-DGATs achieves much better performance in all cases. Generally speaking, the sparser the training instances are, the more improvement will it obtain. For example, the relative improvements of our model on the four user groups are 6.32%, 4.15%, 3.76% and 2.43% respectively on Ciao. The rationale behind is that social information could work as the complement to user-item interactions and provide evidence to users\u2019 preferences. For users in the cold-start group which lack sufficient interactions, they will ask for more social relations to make up for the deficiency. In addition, Epinions achieves 3.71% of relative improvement in cold-start scenario, which is obviously smaller than on Ciao, this could be attributed to that interactions and social relations in Epinions are both much sparser than Ciao.\n",

In addition, RML-SGATs performs better than RML-IGATs on the two metrics. The rationale behind may be that social connections does not necessary guarantee similar preferences while user\u2019s consumed items typically conform to her tastes. Therefore, considering the different contributions of social neighbors will bring more benefits. Furthermore, although all with two dual GATs, DGATs performs poorly than both RML-IGATs and RML-SGATs. This is not surprising since DGATs ignores the constructions of two relation vectors which could translate each user to both multiple item-aware and social-aware representations.
