Rapid laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV is the key to successful containment and prevention of the spread. Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT, e.g., real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction [real-time RT-qPCR]), virus isolation, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and serological methods (e.g., antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and immunofluorescence assay [IFA] ) have been developed and used for MERS-CoV diagnosis [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . While the \"gold standard\" for MERS-CoV diagnosis is NAAT of the upper region of the envelope gene (up-E) or the nucleocapsid (N) gene as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), antigen capture ELISA assay for MERS-CoV can also be informative when NAAT is not available or when the serological assay is used to confirm the findings and aid treatment decision [2, 3] .",

To avoid crosscontamination from amplicons in NAATs, the workflow usually requires four separate physical locations: (1) sample preparation (lysis, extraction of nucleic acids, and reverse transcription), (2) NAAT master mix preparation, (3) template addition, and (4) amplification and analysis. Though technologies like real-time RT-qPCR simplify the workflow, such requirements limit the assay to be performed in regional laboratories designed or designated for this application. Antigen capture ELISA, on the other hand, can be performed on open bench in a single location after virus inactivation, allowing it to be performed in even the most minimally designed facility.",

For more stringent testing and faster turnaround, it calls for a real-time PCR thermal cycler (e.g., Roche's LightCycler systems or Bio-Rad Touch detection systems) which requires a fair amount of initial investment and limits the assay from being performed in remote or less developed locations. In contrast, antigen capture ELISA and other serological methods can be performed with much simpler equipment.

For rapid on-site diagnosis of MERS-CoV, we have previously reported the adaptation of the antigen capture ELISA in the format of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). This assay can yield results in under half an hour, requires minimal equipment, training, and can be stored at room temperature, thus allowing it to be performed in the field [12] . This LFIA is also able to detect MERS-CoV-like viruses (e.g., Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5) and is useful for the research to understand the evolutional history of MERS-CoV [13, 14] .",

The capture antibody is coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate before the assay. Then following sample processing, the lysate is incubated in the wells of the microtiter plate. If the sample contains peptides from MERS-CoV (specifically nucleocapsid protein), they will bind with the coated antibody and be \"captured\" onto the microtiter plate. Even minute amount of viral peptide can be retained in the well if the capture antibody has a high affinity to the peptide and was coated at high concentration. Unbonded proteins are then washed away before the addition of the second, \"detection\" antibody. The secondary MAb also recognizes the MERS-CoV NP, presumably binds to a distinct epitope, and is conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for detection. The combination of two MAbs in an ELISA assay offers increased sensitivity for MERS-CoV NP. On the other hand, this \"sandwich\" approach also allows improved specificity for the MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein by combining the specificities of the two MAbs, allowing it to differentiate and identify MERS-CoV spiked sample from other samples from healthy and patients who contracted various respiratory tract infections, as previously demonstrated [3] . In this assay the nucleocapsid protein was selected as the target for generating antibodies to detect MERS-CoV. According to previous experience when working with SARS-CoV, we observed that the NP is a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed structural protein, and a more preferable target than the spike (S) protein [16, 17] . Working with the hypothesis that the NP protein of MERS-CoV might also be a desirable target when developing an antigen capture ELISA for it, we have shown that the assay offers high specificity and sensitivity, as mentioned above. The steps related to the cloning and purification of (His) 6 -tagged recombinant NP (rNP) of MERS-CoV for the generation of anti-MERS-CoV-rNP MAbs will not be described, as there are commercially available antibodies readily available for purchase. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP) system was used for the colorimetric visualization at the final stage of the assay. Commercial ELISA kits may utilize other detection methods; optimization may be needed. For readers who would like to generate their own HRP conjugated detection antibody, there are also kits available.",

The accuracy and reproducibility of the assay can be affected, as the peptides from fungus or other microorganisms may compete with the target antigen. Prepare fresh solutions periodically (~1 month); autoclave or filter sterilize the buffers if available. If contaminations are a common occurrence, the addition of 0.05% sodium azide (NaN 3 ) as a preservative is an option.",
