This approach makes it possible to compare models and configurations, however it also decouples the explanation from the evaluation. With the adoption of neural re-ranking models, where the scoring process is arguably more complex than traditional retrieval methods, the divide between result score and the reasoning behind it becomes even stronger. Because neural models learn based on data, they are more likely to evade our intuition about how their components should behave. Having a thorough understanding of neural re-ranking models is important for anybody who wants to analyze or deploy these models [6, 7].",

We cluster the queries using their term representations taken from the neural model. Users can explore each query result in more detail: We show the internal partial scores and content of the returned documents with different highlighting modes to surface the inner workings of a neural re-ranking model.

In the cluster header we display a manually assigned summary title, the median result of the queries, and median difference to the initial BM25 ranking, as this is the basis for the re-ranking. Each query is displayed with the rank of the first relevant document, the difference to BM25, and the query text. The controls at the top allow to sort the queries and clusters \u2013 including a random option to discover new queries.

First, users can choose a minimum cosine similarity that a term pair must exceed to be colored, which is a simple way of exploring the semantic similarity of the word representations.
