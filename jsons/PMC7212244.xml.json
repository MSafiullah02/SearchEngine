According to Facebook\u2019s 2019 annual report,4 the company had revenue of $70.7 billion and earned $18.5 billion. Despite all the bad press about Facebook in the wake of the 2016 Russian election interference scandal, daily active users still increased by nine percent to 1.66 billion by the end of 2019. The number of employees at Facebook surged as well in 2019, with the company reporting 44,942 workers at the end of 2019, an increase of 26 percent in a single year. Overall, the company estimated that on average about 2.5 billion people used Facebook at least every month by end of 2019, an increase of eight percent in a single year. The company describes itself in the press release in this way: \u201cFounded in 2004, Facebook\u2019s mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People use Facebook\u2019s apps and technologies to connect with friends and family, find communities and grow businesses.\u201d The self-description highlights the deliberate self-deception: While Facebook does provide the services listed, it also furnishes an excellent way to spread malicious disinformation and propaganda to both domestic and foreign audiences.",

And it\u2019s working. In the five years ended on December 31, 2019 (before the global financial shock from COVID-19), Facebook stock increased in value by about 163 percent, while the NASDAQ index was up about 87 percent over the same period.5 Allowing free access to the platform keeps revenue up and costs down.",

The real problem is that the users are not the financial priority of Facebook or almost any social media site. Rather, the advertisers are the key customers being served by the platform. In addition, the investors (in the form of shareholders) also rank far above the users in terms of company priorities. Almost any move made to protect the platform and its users from being used in digital war would adversely affect service to the advertisers and the shareholders.",

Although Facebook is slightly harder to join than Twitter, it\u2019s still relatively easy to create fake accounts.6 Changing a system in which artificial intelligence is overwhelmingly used to detect fake accounts would be expensive and cumbersome, but still possible (not least by having better AI). But there is a deeper problem. As the value of social media companies is based to a large degree on the number of users, it is not in the interest of the companies (or their shareholders) in either identifying fake accounts or in discouraging them in general. While social media companies may publicly condemn fake accounts and occasionally purge some, in reality fake accounts prop up their business model.",

            "text": "Content moderation is a more complex issue for social media companies. On the one hand, better content moderation would make a more pleasant experience for a user seeking to avoid extreme speech, pornography, trolling, or what could be considered culturally inappropriate elements of the public sphere (or inappropriate for a particular age or group). Social media companies do moderate their content to screen out child pornography, extreme violence, etc., although even this is quite difficult. Yet, emotionally charged subject matter drives engagement (Celis et al. 2019). This dovetails with the need to attract consumers to the site so that they can be marketed to advertisers. Thus, a quiet, calm public sphere is not the best for their business model. It\u2019s true that it would be much more expensive for social media companies to moderate either content or users in a more forceful and efficient way. But as with fake users, outrageous content also helps the bottom line. So it\u2019s a lose\u2013lose for social media companies to police their users and their content, as it would be far more costly and actually might reduce engagement. So their reluctance to do so is more than financial or logistical. Moderation works directly against their core economic interests as companies.7",

If we stick to a dialogue that compares the benefits of social media to the problems of social media, we are unlikely to drive change. However, if citizens and policymakers alike can be made aware of the critical role of U.S. social media companies in supporting information operations by foreign states, then change is more likely. This means making the central role of information warfare in modern conflict much more visible and compelling. This will take a significant shift in thinking for citizens, democratic leaders, and social media companies alike: In the American laissez-faire freedom of speech model, it is assumed that misinformation and even disinformation are just part of the marketplace of ideas. However, this is a misconception in a world in which information is deployed into highly engaged, yet highly segregated, communities of voters who are essentially walled off from fact-based journalism and information. In the United States, Russia and other foreign entities are able to deploy weapons of mass persuasion directly on vulnerable citizens, with both the vulnerabilities and the deployment system provided to a large degree by social media companies. This vulnerability also came into clearer view during the coronavirus epidemic, as propaganda released for financial and political gain added to the global \u2018infodemic.\u2019",

It is added to the first four dimensions of land, sea, air, and space. Information warfare is, of course, not a new phenomenon but it is radically changed and augmented by the digital sphere. In particular, the advent and wide adoption of social media around the globe gave a unique and unprecedented opportunity for countries to carry out information operations on the citizens of other states. The design of social media allows foreign influence operations to identify key groups, infiltrate them, and manipulate them. In 2016, Russians were particularly interested in using wedge issues as ways to polarize and manipulate U.S. citizens and could be effective at doing this with Trump supporters via social media (Jamieson 2018).",

With social media in its current state, this type of activity cannot be detected or curtailed in a reasonable way because it is embedded in the very nature of social media. It is so easy to pose as another, to gain trust, to polarize, and even convince people to change behavior that American corporations such as Facebook create a low-cost weapon for foreign enemies. Thus, American corporate ingenuity and business logic created a weapon that is deployed against Americans themselves.",

In point of fact, user activity is harvested and sold to advertisers, so users are working for the social media companies in exchange for access. Few users, however, either realize or are particularly perturbed by that tradeoff. We could compare this to the rise of the automobile as a mode of transport. Initially, cars were seen as independent luxury items and there were few rules to govern their use. The early automobile age was accompanied by chaos and a high rate of accidents. Over time, governments took over regulation of the roads and\u2014to a large degree\u2014of car safety through the introduction of seat belts, anti-locking brakes, airbags, and other features. Yet, almost 40,000 Americans die in car accidents every year and tens of thousands more are injured.8 So Americans do accept trade-offs. But there has never been a national discussion about the security tradeoffs in social media. What is the level of safety that is necessary? How can we start a national conversation about this? Why is it a mistake to leave this in the hands of companies? How can we maintain a robust online sphere, but keep it much safer? Are citizens willing to pay for this, either directly or through government support?",

Regulating social media is enormously difficult and that\u2019s just in the United States, which has the advantage of being the headquarters of large Western social media companies. Much of this is due to excessive cyber-optimism in the United States, in particular as an echo of the origins of the internet as a research and educational tool outside of the commercial realm. Although that aspect of the internet has been long overshadowed by the commercial web, there is no comprehensive set of laws to specifically regulate the internet. Nor is there any public consensus on social media regulation, although just over half of Americans now believe that major tech companies should be more heavily regulated.9 But according to the Pew Research Center, Republicans feel that tech companies might already interfere with content too much: 85 percent of Republicans suspect that tech companies censor political viewpoints.",

Prior to 9/11, the idea that U.S. citizens would go through body and luggage searches for all domestic flights would have been laughable. Yet, Americans and visitors now go through searches not only at airports, but in a wide range of other public spaces. While this is framed as a defense against foreign attacks, Americans face significant threats from domestic terrorism. Here is a silver lining to how illuminating the capabilities of social media as a tool for foreign actors to wage disinformation war against U.S. citizens is useful. American democracy also faces significant online domestic threats, from anti-vaxxers to hate groups to disinformation attacks on political opponents. Politically, though, there is no will to frame social media as a key part of that problem; rather, the general narrative is that disinformation is an unfortunate side effect of the social media we cannot live without.",

The threat of social media is much less visible and woven not only into the generally opaque nature of social media as people pose, pretend, and market themselves.

As the coronavirus pandemic has led to heightened awareness of both the importance and vulnerability of trustworthy information, this could be a watershed moment in understanding and valuing the communication ecosystem. YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki said that the virus had been \u201can acceleration of our digital lives\u201d and noted that it caused the platform to speed up changes to direct users to authoritative information.10 It is particularly relevant to consider how YouTube addressed health disinformation in the coronavirus pandemic, in that a study by the Oxford Internet Institute found that the platform had emerged as a \u201cmajor purveyor of health and wellbeing information\u201d (Marchal et al. 2020, p. 1).

All it will take is some relatively unified political leadership that can highlight this threat and Americans may indeed be ready for significant changes to the current social media model. Just as Americans pay a security tax for every airline flight, they may be willing to endorse a model of social media that is forced to take responsibility for its users and content. This will likely mean much more stringent government regulation and a change from Section 230.
