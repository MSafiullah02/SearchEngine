The dynamics of the infected population are modeled by a nonlinear infection-agedependent partial differential equation, which is coupled with an ordinary differential equation that describes the dynamics of the susceptible population. Theoretical results about global existence and uniqueness of positive solutions are proved. We also present two practical applications of our model: (1) we assess public health guidelines about emergency preparedness and response in the event of a smallpox bioterrorist attack; (2) we simulate the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan and estimate the number of cases avoided by contact tracing. Our model can be applied as a rational basis for decision makers to guide interventions and deploy public health resources in future epidemics.",

These pulses are caused by the choice of the initial infection-age distribution function in Fig. 3b . The majority of the index cases are in an early disease age, and thus they will become infectious and symptomatic in the same time period. As a consequence, symptomatic cases and generations of new cases will appear as pulses; hence daily traced contacts will appear as pulses, since the tracing rate depends on the isolation rate of symptomatic cases. (2) the effective ring vaccination strategy does not require a large number of people to be traced everyday, and is more efficient in controlling the outbreak compared to the mass vaccination (red curves), which requires vaccination of a large number of people everyday; (3) the ineffective ring vaccination has similar results in controlling the outbreak as the mass vaccination (red curves), even though it consumes less vaccine stockpiles in total; it requires extremely heavy daily contact tracing load at times; (4) compared with the case of no vaccination (black curves), mass vaccination and ineffective ring vaccination prevent hundreds of cases from happening; (5) further simulations show that, for higher R sym values, non-vaccination could control the spread of smallpox as well as mass vaccination and ineffective ring vaccination, while in .

Our simulation results point out that with a limited amount of vaccine stockpiles and healthcare workers, ring vaccination is more efficient in preventing the disease from spreading than mass vaccination. With the initial condition in Fig.  3b , there are not many people in the vaccination queue at the beginning of the outbreak.

Therefore, our model would also be helpful in estimating important parameters and predicting transmission dynamics with evolving data during an outbreak. A great difference between the two applications we present in the paper is, contact tracing applied to control SARS in Taiwan, 2003 is not as effective as ring vaccination strategy in eradicating smallpox. The theoretical reason is that we have different settings of contact tracing parameters CT , \u03b7 I , and \u03b7 S in the two applications. In reality, our settings are quite reasonable due to facts such as the severity of symptoms, availability of vaccines (since vaccination is an important way to create herd immunity), and readiness of the public health officials with the preparedness and containment plans.",

The HIV infection has an extremely long asymptomatic period and many HIV-positive people are unaware of their infection with the virus. Thus, an active infected individual would spread the disease without even being aware of the infection, which makes the control and detection of HIV very difficult. Even though we might have an HIV vaccine available in the future, with possible serious side-effects, it might be too limited and costly to be available to everyone at the beginning. So the deployment of a limited amount of vaccine will be a serious issue. Then, because of the prolonged asymptomatic stage of HIV infection, the effects of certain intervention strategies would depend even more on the age of infection. Our model will be an advantageous starting point for such investigation.",

Then by Lemma 87, T \u03c6 = \u221e, hence there is a positive global solution to (4.1).Proof (Proof of Theorem 43) Let T > 0, we assume that u \u2208 C [0, T ] ; L 1 + satisfies (4.1) for t \u2208 [0, T ], then u satisfies the following conditions:We will show that l \u2208 C [0, T ] ; L 1 + as obtained from (4.2), satisfies (2.4) with the aging function G in (P.1) and the birth function F in (P.2). For the first condition in (2.4), we have the following estimation:Estimate I 1 and I 2 separately:With the assumption on function \u00b5, we can find constants C 1 , C 2 > 0 such that:Since i is obtained from (4.2), we have:Then by the differential equation of S(t) in (2.1), we have:Integrate on both sides with respect to t of the above inequality,Hence one of the conclusion is proved:Moreover, it can be derived from the differential equation system (2.1) that: i (t) L 1 dt similarly as we did in the beginning of this proof and get \u221e 0 I (t) dt < \u221e, which implies the conclusion lim t\u2192\u221e I (t) = 0.",
