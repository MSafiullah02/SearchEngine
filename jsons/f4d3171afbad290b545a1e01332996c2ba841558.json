Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan (China), more than 70 thousand patients were affected. The disease resulted in 1,870 deaths by February 18, 2020, according to the National Health Commission of People\u2032s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn). The number of patients diagnosed and death is still on the rise. Unfortunately thus far, no proven effective treatment is available for patients contracted this emerging infection. Experience in the management of coronavirus epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has limited applicability for treating COVID-19. The Chinese health care teams have been fully engaged at the frontline to deal with this COVID-19 epidemic. They are also actively conducting many scientific studies on the pathogenesis of the diseases caused by this virus, mode of transmission, clinical profiles, management, and disease prevention.",

The first anti-viral clinical trial with Lopinavir/Ritonavir has already reached the targeted sample size of 160 cases. The data on the outcome of the treatment are currently being analyzed and re-sults are expected to be revealed soon. The anti-coronavirus activity of Lopinavir/Ritonavir has already been found from SARS clinical cases in the past (Chan et al., 2003) . There are ongoing clinical trials on the use of Remdesivir with an ambitious targeted sample size of 760 patients. Remdesivir, an adenosine analog, when incorporated into nascent viral RNA chains, results in premature termination of viral replications. This has been found to be a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV . As shown in Table  S1 and Table S2 in supporting information, there are a large number of anti-viral agents being used in the registered clinical trials in China. Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine is highly expected to be a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro . It is worth noting that this novice way of using old drugs for treating coronavirus may prove to be a quick way to find an effective treatment.",

If all 125 trials are performed as planned, a total of 19,749 subjects are required to conduct such trials. As suggested in a recent commentary in Nature, a master plan guiding the protocol and standards of research design in patient recruitment, randomization and measurements of outcomes will be required. When there is a standardized protocol, then one can pool knowledge gained from the different trials for comparison of the effectiveness of various approaches (Maxmen, 2020) . However, the cost of all those 125 registered trials is enormous. Thus, every effort should be made to avoid repetition of the same clinical trials. We advocate the establishment of a national system of sharing data and keeping database for analysis in order to share knowledge for the advancement of effective treatment and to avoid wasting of national financial and human resources.",

For example, in the design of Remdesirvir trials (NCT04252664, NCT04257656), the placebo was used with the exclusion of any other experimental treatment. The very strict requirements of using a placebo may cause harm to the patients under study for sacrificing the potential best patient care. This is pertinent when clinical trials are undertaken among critically ill patients in ICU as there is a need to divide the cohort equally between study and control groups when placebo or other comparators is used. Potential risk of intervention investigated should be fully evaluated and minimized. Therefore, we recommend that the Institution Review Board (IRB) from different institutions should scrutinize the protocols submitted for clinical trials very carefully before approving. To date, many of the protocols posted have not yet received local IRB approval. We also recommend the establishment of a national IRB by the National Health Commission during the epidemic crisis to review effectively these ethical issues.",
