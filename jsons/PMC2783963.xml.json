The first domain in enteroviruses forms a cloverleaf (CL) structure [8] that carries signals to control both translation and RNA replication (Fig. 1A, B) [9]. The PV CL (88 nt) contains four stem loops (SL-A to SL-D), which is followed by a spacer region (nt 89\u2013123) located between the cloverleaf and the IRES (Fig. 1A). The second domain of the enteroviral 5\u2032 NTR is the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that promotes translation.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have shown that the formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, consisting of cloverleaf RNA, cellular protein PCBP and viral protein 3CDpro, is required for viral RNA replication and virus proliferation [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Protein PCBP2, with its KH1 domain, was shown to bind to stem loop B of the cloverleaf [13], [15], [16]. The primary PCBP2 binding sites on the CL are located on 3C residues in the loop of SL-B (nt 23\u201325) and on two Cs (C94 and C95) in the spacer region [15], [17]. The other partner in the formation of the CL RNP complex is proteinase and RNA binding protein 3CDpro for PV [12], [14], [18] or 3Cpro for rhinoviruses [19]. PV proteins 3Cpro/3CDpro interact with a tetra loop (UGCG) in SL-D of PV (Fig. 1B) but do not bind to the HRV14 CL, which contains only 3 nt (UAU) [20]. Interestingly, the formation of another RNP complex that included CL RNA, and viral proteins 3AB and 3CDpro, was also shown to be important for PV RNA replication [12], [14]. Herold and Andino [21] have proposed a model in which the PV genome circularizes prior to minus-strand RNA synthesis by way of an interaction between cellular poly(A) binding protein with the poly(A) tail of PV RNA on the one hand and PCBP2/3CDpro/CL on the other. This model was based on an observation that PABP physically interacts with PCBP2, 3CDpro and the poly(A) tail both in vivo and in vitro.",

[22] have shown that the duplex structure of SL-A in the PV CL (Fig. 1B) was required for minus-strand but not for plus-strand RNA synthesis. On the other hand altering the primary sequence at the 5\u2032-terminal end of SL-A resulted in a striking reduction of plus-strand RNA synthesis. These results suggested that the 3\u2032-terminal end of minus-strands is required for the initiation of plus-strand RNA synthesis. The specific binding of cellular proteins (p36 and p38) and of viral protein 2CATPase to the 3\u2032-end of minus-strand PV RNA has also been reported [23], [24], [25].",

In PV the poly(A) tail is a part of the overall 3\u2032-terminal structure with poly(A) hybridized to sequences in stem X, just upstream from the termination codon (Fig. 1B). The predicted structures were confirmed by enzymatic and chemical probing [28], [29].

This type of cre was first discovered by McKnight and Lemon [39] in the VP1 coding sequence of HRV14 and was shown to be required for RNA replication [40]. Since then similar cres have been identified in the 2CATPase coding domains of PV (Fig. 1B) [41] and CVB3 [42]. In rhinoviruses the corresponding cre elements are found in the 2A ORF of species A rhinoviruses [43], the VP1 ORF of species B rhinoviruses (Fig. 1C) [39], the VP2 ORF of species C rhinoviruses [44]. The precise function of the cre (oriI) is to template the linkage of two UMPs to VPg, to yield VPgpU and VPgpUpU, the primers for both plus and minus-strand RNA synthesis [45], [46], [47]. According to current models of PV RNA replication the VPgpUpU made on the oriI is used for the initiation of both plus and minus-strand RNA synthesis [34], [37].",

Within this motif, the A5 residue templates the linkage of both UMPs to VPg by a \u201cslide back mechanism\u201d in a reaction catalyzed by RNA polymerase 3Dpol and stimulated by viral proteinase 3CDpro\n[37], [45], [46], [47], [49]. Based on biochemical studies Pathak et al. [50] proposed a model for the assembly of the PV VPg uridylylation RNP complex. According to this model the first step is the binding of a 3CDpro dimer to the upper part of the oriI stem, which is unwound. In the next step 3Dpol associates with the complex via an interaction between the back of the thumb subdomain of 3Dpol and a convex surface formed by the top of the subunits of the 3Cpro dimer [51].",

This RNA element potently inhibits the activity of a cellular protein, RNase L, a latent endoribonucloease in an interferon-regulated, dsRNA-activated pathway. The RNA structure consists of 4 stem loops and of these stem loops 1 and 4 is important for function. These are involved in a putative \u201ckissing loop\u201d interaction [54]. Interestingly, RNase L activity was activated late during the course of PV replication in HeLa cells as virus assembly neared completion. This activity did not diminish virus production; rather, it was associated with larger plaques and increased cell-to-cell spread. Han et al. [53] suggested the possibility that RNase L, which is activated late in infection and is proapoptotic, facilitates cythopathic effect and virus release at the end of the PV growth cycle. We have included this RNA structure in our discussion although currently its exact function in the PV life cycle is not known. It is possible, however, that a biological function for it will be discovered in the future but only under certain conditions, such as in different cell lines.",

First, their 5\u2032-terminal RNA elements have a less-defined structure than the corresponding enteroviral CL [55]. Second, the 5\u2032 NTRs contain a long poly(C) tract of about 130 nt in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (Fig. 2A) and 150\u2013250 nt in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (Fig. 2B). EMCV genomic RNA contains a 5\u2032-terminal hairpin (84 nt), linked to two pseudoknots (Pk, Fig. 2A) [56], which are connected to the poly(C) tract, followed by the IRES. In FMDV the 5\u2032 NTR (> 1300 nt) begins with a very large (360-bp) stem loop structure (S fragment) [7], then the poly(C) tract, three to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots of unknown function [57], the cre element [38] and finally the IRES (Fig. 2B). The S fragment is predicted to function in RNA replication although direct evidence for this is lacking. Interestingly, Serrano et al. [58] have identified an interaction in vitro between the 3\u2032 NTR-poly(A) tail and the S fragment (Fig. 2B).",

In Aichi virus the first 115 nt of the 5\u2032 NTR are predicted to form three stem loops (SL-A to SL-C) and a pseudoknot [73]. Disruption of these RNA elements impaired minus-strand RNA synthesis while the stem of SL-A was found to be important for plus-strand RNA synthesis. Nagashima et al. [74] have observed a specific binding of viral protein 3ABC to the 5\u2032 NTR of Aichi virus and this binding was required for minus-strand RNA synthesis. Recent studies by Sasaki and Taniguchi [75] indicated that a 7-nt long segment (UCCCACU and its complementary sequence) in the stem of SL-A of Aichi virus has an important role in encapsidation. The 5\u2032 NTR of Porcine kobuvirus (S-1-HUN) is 576-nt long and is predicted to form seven stem loops [72]. The first three of these stem loops are similar to those of Aichi virus. A polypyrimidine tract is located between nt 459 and 465, within a predicted IRES element (nt 284\u2013576), which has a strong sequence similarity to that of Porcine teschovirus and belongs to the type IV hepaci/pestivirus IRES group (Figs. 4A and 5E\n). The 3\u2032 NTR of Porcine kobuvirus is 167 nucleotides long and is predicted to form three stem loops (Fig. 4A) [72]. Using bioinformatics analysis methods Simmonds et al.

Closer analyses of the 5\u2032 NTR RNA of Porcine teschovirus-1 (PTV-1) led to the unexpected discovery that in structure and function the IRES of this virus is more related to the IRES of hepatitis C virus (HCV) than to the types I\u2013III IRESes discussed above (Fig. 5E) [90]. As can be seen, the PTV-1 IRES (Fig. 5E) consists only of two major stem loop domains (domains II and III), forming a pseudoknot at the base of domain III, and it is only 290-nt long (between the base of domain II and the initiating AUG at nt 412) [91]. The small size, the architecture and genetic properties resemble the IRES of HCV. Indeed, it now appears that HCV-related IRES elements are found in genomes of many genera of picornaviruses [78]. The HCV-like IRES elements of picornaviruses are designated as type IV IRESes. For a more detailed discussion of the HCV IRES, see the section on Flaviviridae. A recent report by Reuter et al. [72] shows the putative IRES element (nt 284\u2013576) of Porcine kobuvirus (Fig. 5D), which has a 74% sequence similarity to the IRES of Porcine teschovirus (Fig. 5E). The predicted structure of this IRES element (nt 122\u2013411) is also that of type IV IRESes, similar to those of hepaci- and pestiviruses.",

The AUG codon in type II IRES elements is the initiating codon (in aphthoviruses, a downstream codon may also be used) whereas in type I IRESes, the motif is upstream of the initiating codon and its AUG codon is, therefore, cryptic. Genetic analyses have shown that the integrity of the motif is essential for IRES function. Eliminating Yn or shortening or enlarging Xm, etc., have resulted in severe deficiencies in translation of PV RNA; the same is true for the EMCV type II IRES [93], [94], [95], [96]. It has been speculated that the YnXmAUG motif may constitute the \u201clanding pad\u201d for the small ribosomal subunit but direct evidence for this hypothesis is still lacking. In contrast to enteroviruses and EMCV, Pilipenko et al [97] reported that the YnXmAUG motif in Theiler's virus, another species of the genus Cardiovirus, is dispensable for translation in vitro and for replication of the virus in tissue culture [97]. These authors found, however, that elimination of the motif strongly influenced the pathogenesis of Theiler's virus in mice. Meanwhile, available evidence has clearly indicated that IRES elements do not function by the same mechanism in recruiting the ribosomal subunits, followed by selecting the initiating AUG codon. Indeed, the HCV-related type IV IRESes of picornaviruses, discussed above, lack the YnXmAUG motif altogether.",

On the other hand, the overall function of IRES elements \u2013 internal initiation of translation \u2013 is the same, regardless of the underlying mechanism. Would an exchange of these different IRES elements between different picornaviruses yield viable viruses? The answer is yes. This was surprising since it was originally expected that these genetic elements that are huge in relation to the small viral genomes would contribute to functions other than translational control. Many IRES chimeras were analyzed using PV as the backbone. They included the exchange of the PV IRES with other type I IRESes such as CVB3 [98], HRV2 and HRV14 [99], with type II IRESes such as EMCV [100], and even with the IRES of HCV [101], a virus belonging to a different family. In HeLa cells at 37 \u00b0C, these chimeric viruses replicated with wt kinetics, an observation suggesting that surrounding sequences did not influence the function of the IRES elements. Chimeras, however, may express interesting phenotypes, for example host range phenotypes, when assayed under different conditions. For example, PV carrying the HRV2 IRES [\u201cPV(RIPO)\u201d] is highly attenuated in cells of neuronal origin [99], [102].",

Using chimeric subgenomic replicons of HCV, Kim et al.

Surprisingly, nearly all research publications up to the time of writing this review, and also most review articles, reproduce domain IIa with the wrong, pre-2001 secondary structure. The downstream boundary of the HCV IRES extends unexpectedly into the core-coding region [101], [115], [116], [117]. In the HCV core-coding region, adjacent to the 5\u2032 NTR, there is evidence for both phylogenetically conserved RNA structures and an overlapping reading frame (ARF) in the 1+ frame, the latter encoding a putative polypeptide of approximately 124 aa [118]. Antibodies to polypeptides from this reading frame have been found in HCV infected patients, but the significance of its expression remains unclear [119], [120], [121], [122]. Two RNA stem loop structures SL-V and SL-VI have been predicted to exist in the region containing the ARF and were confirmed by enzymatic structure probing (Fig. 6A) [120]. This region was found to be dispensable for the replication of the subgenomic HCV replicon in cell culture [122]. It was proposed that these stem loops might be involved in the stimulation of HCV IRES function by reducing inhibitory interactions between the 5\u2032 NTR and the core region [116], [123]. Using a chimpanzee model McMullan et al. [122] have also demonstrated that the ARF protein was not essential for HCV genotype 1a H77 RNA replication. However, the ARF region contains a functionally important RNA element (SL-VI) whose role remains unknown.",

Using a mutational analysis it was observed that SL47 and SL87 (corresponding to SL-V and S-VI, respectively) [122] are important RNA elements contributing to HCV genome translation and replication both in cell culture and in vivo but SL248 and SL443 have no function.

            "text": "Several independent groups have predicted the existence of extensive RNA secondary structure within the C-terminal NS5B encoding region of HCV, just upstream from the 3\u2032 NTR, suggesting the possibility that these have a function in vivo\n[120], [127], [128], [129], [130]. The C-terminal coding region (nt 9126\u20139374) of NS5B contains four highly conserved and stable stem loops (SL-IV to SL-VII) (Fig. 6A) [131]. A mutational analysis of these stem loops, in the context of the subgenomic HCV replicon, revealed that SL-V (nt 9262\u20139311) and SL-VI (nt 9215\u20139260) are essential for RNA replication in Huh-7 cells while the integrity of SL-IV (nt 9318\u20139355) and SL-VII (9129\u20139189) is less important. In vitro gel shift and filter-binding assays have shown that purified RNA polymerase NS5B specifically binds to SL-V. A similar study by You et al. [132] has also identified SL-V, designated as 5BSL3.2, as an essential cis-acting RNA for the replication of the HCV replicon in tissue culture. This hairpin is about 50 nt in length and consists of an 8-bp lower helix, a 6-bp upper helix, a 12-nt terminal loop and an 8-nt long internal loop. Primary sequences in the loops and RNA structure of the upper helix were found to be important for function. Interestingly, this RNA stem loop could be functionally moved to the 3\u2032 NTR, albeit with a reduction in replication efficiency. This same hairpin 5BSL3.2 was found to be involved in a \u201ckissing\u201d interaction between the upper loop and the loop of another hairpin SL2, located in the 3\u2032 NTR (Fig. 6A) [133]. The importance of this tertiary RNA structure was confirmed by the rescue of RNA replication by compensating changes in both stem loops. Recent studies with the HCV cell culture system (HCVcc), using fully infectious HCV, demonstrated that both the \u201ckissing\u201d loop interaction and the length and composition of the poly(U/UC) tract were critical important for the replication in the genotype 2a HCVcc context [134]. A model was proposed in which one or more trans acting factors interact with the highly conserved X tail to aid the formation of the \u201ckissing\u201d loop interaction. Using various bioinformatics methods to detect phylogenetically conserved RNA secondary structures, Diviney et al. [135] have predicted an additional long range interaction between the bulge loop of 5SBL3.2 (also known as SL9266) and an unpaired sequence located about 200 nucleotides upstream (around nt 9100) in the NS5B coding sequence. Mutational analyses of the two interacting sequences provided genetic support for this interaction. Fig. 6 illustrates the proposed structure of this pseudoknot with long-range interactions of SL9266 with 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 sequences. Despite extensive studies in several laboratories the precise role of this stem loop structure (SL9266) in HCV RNA replication remains unknown.",

The remaining region, with variable sequences, is predicted to form two less-stable stem loop structures (SLII, SLIII), designated as 3\u2032V [142] (Fig. 6B). Studies with subgenomic BVDV replicon RNAs indicated that the 3\u2032-terminal SLI and part of the single-stranded region between SLI and SLII were essential for RNA replication [141]. The same results were obtained in the context of an infectious full-length BVDV cDNA clone [143]. The deletion of both SLII and SLIII were also found to result in a lethal growth phenotype [143]. However, deletions of either SLII or SLIII did not have a significant effect on viral replication. Interestingly, using a replicon system, Isken et al. [142] observed that the proper conformation of 3\u2032V is required for accurate termination of translation at the stop codon of the viral ORF and this is essential for efficient RNA replication. However, this observation could not be confirmed in the context of the full length BVDV genome [143]. The binding of the so-called NFAR proteins both to the 3\u2032V domain and to the 5\u2032 NTR was observed suggesting the possibility of an interaction between the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-terminii of the viral RNA [144].",

The predicted secondary structures all contain a large stem loop (SLA) (\u223c 70 nt), which for DENV was proposed to function as the promoter for negative strand RNA synthesis (Fig. 6C) [147], [148]. Two helical regions were identified in DENV SLA, a side stem loop, a top loop and an U bulge as critical for RNA replication [147]. A conserved oligo(U) track present downstream of SLA was found to modulate RNA synthesis in transfected cells [147]. A smaller hairpin (SLB) is located at or near the translation initiation codon. This RNA element contains a 16 nt long stretch, called the 5\u2032 upstream AUG region (5\u2032UAR), which is complementary to a sequence in the 3\u2032 NTR (3\u2032UAR). This pair of complementary sequences was named cyclization sequence 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 UAR and the importance of this long-range interaction was shown to be essential for RNA replication of both DENV and WNV [149], [150], [151]. Additional complementary sequences have been identified between the coding sequence of protein C (5\u2032CS) and a sequence just upstream of the 3\u2032SL in the 3\u2032 NTR (3\u2032CS). The requirement for complementarity between 5\u2032CS and 3\u2032CS for RNA replication was demonstrated for KUNV, DENV and WNV [150], [152], [153]. Long range interactions between the ends of flavivirus RNA were confirmed by visualization of individual molecules using atomic force microscopy [150].",

Domain II contains moderately conserved sequences and two stem loops (A2 and A3), including a dumbbell structure with a conserved sequence motif (CS2) [105], [157]. Deletions of A2 or A3 resulted in reduced RNA replication [150]. The most conserved domain (III) of the 3\u2032 NTR includes a stable stem loop at the terminus (3\u2032SL), whose structure was confirmed by biochemical probing and which is absolutely required for RNA replication [150], [158]. Upstream of the 3\u2032SL there is the conserved cyclization sequence (CS1 or 3\u2032CS) (Fig. 6C) [150].",

In groups 1 and 2 coronaviruses the 5\u2032 NTR ranges in size from 210 nt [MHV, hCoV and BCoV] to 314 nt [transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)]. The minimal 5\u2032 cis-replicating element for RNA replication usually extends into the replicase ORF. In the case of group 3 coronaviruses such as IBV the 5\u2032 NTR (528 nt) appears to contain the entire cis-acting RNA element. The 5\u2032-genomic region of BCoV contains at least 6 stem loop structures, numbered SL-I to SL-VI in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, whose structures were confirmed by enzymatic probing (Fig. 9) [195], [196], [197], [198], [199]. Stem loops I and II were found to be essential for RNA replication. SL II contains a \u201ctranscription regulating sequence\u201d (TRS), which is involved in the transcription of SG RNAs. SL-III and SL-IV were identified as cis-acting elements for DI RNA replication. In these stem loops the structure of the stem rather than the primary sequences are important RNA replication. SL-IV contains the start codon for the replicase ORF in the downstream arm of its stem. The binding of purified nsp1, the N-terminal ORF 1a protein, to SLIII and its flanking sequences was also demonstrated [195]. A recent study suggests that the base of SL-I mediates a long range interaction between the 5\u2032 NTR and the 3\u2032 NTR that is an essential step in the transcription of SG RNAs but is not required for genomic minus-strand synthesis [200].",

This sequence contains two stem loops (SL V and SL VI) whose structures were confirmed by RNase probing. SL VI maps within the nsp1 coding region (ORF 1a) found in all naturally occurring DI particles (Fig. 9) [196]. Mutational analyses have indicated that SLVI is required for DI RNA replication and is likely to be also involved in the replication of the full-length viral genome [201]. Recently, SLV was also identified as a cis-acting RNA element [195]. In SLV the overall higher-order structure and the integrity of the lower stem contributed to optimal RNA replication. Two cellular proteins were found to bind SLV and SLVI in vitro but the biological relevance of these interactions is not yet proven [195].",

For MHV the domain required for RNA replication not only encompassed the 3\u2032 NTR but also ran into the adjacent N ORF [202]. In contrast the required cis-acting signals for coronaviruses groups 1 and 2 did not contain any of the N coding sequences [203]. The 3\u2032 NTR of MHV and BoCV upstream end contains a bulged stem loop [204] and a pseudoknot (Fig. 9) [205]. The bulged stem loop and the pseudoknot overlap and they cannot form simultaneously. This has led to a proposal that these structures are part of a molecular switch that regulates different steps of replication. The pseudoknot is followed by a variable region containing nt 46\u2013156 from the 3\u2032-end of MHV RNA (HVR), within which a highly conserved octanucleotide (GGAAGAGC) is located. Interestingly, the MHV HVR is required for DI RNA replication but not for the replication of full length genomic RNA [206], [207]. However, the HVR has a significant role in pathogenesis [207]. The very 3\u2032-end of the genome (\u223c 55 nt) is required for MHV minus-strand RNA synthesis, as determined by DI RNA analysis, in conjunction with a poly(A) tail of 5\u201310 nt [205], [208], [209]. Recently, a direct interaction was demonstrated between loop 1 of the pseudoknot and the extreme 3\u2032 end of the MHV genome (Fig. 9) [210]. In the same study an interaction between the pseudoknot and gene 1a replicase products nsp8 and nsp9 was also reported.",

Mutational analyses have confirmed that the \u201ckissing interaction\u201d was required for replication but the ability of the two loops to base pair and not their sequence was functionally relevant.",

Interestingly, caliciviruses use a novel protein-directed translation initiation, which relies on the interaction of eIF4E and VPg-linked to the RNA [228].

These RNA structures are involved in the complex process of RNA replication and in some cases also in promoting the initiation of translation. The virus families differ from each other greatly in the total number of functional RNA structures in their genomes and also in the lengths of their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NTRs. For example some viral RNAs contain large IRES elements in their 5\u2032 NTRs that are required for the translation of the polyprotein while other viruses with shorter 5\u2032 NTRs use cap-dependent translation. In general, where the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 NTRs are too short to include all of the required functional elements, the RNA structures extend into the downstream or upstream coding sequences, respectively. In some viral genomes functional structural elements are also located in the coding sequences far away from the genomic ends that are not an extension of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NTRs. These \u201cinternal\u201d cis-acting RNA structures are involved in a variety of processes such as ribosomal frameshifting, RNA replication or encapsidation. Although the functional importance of many of these structures have been confirmed by genetic and biochemical studies their precise roles are not yet fully understood.",

Interestingly, there was remarkable variability between genera of each family that exhibited this characteristic. GORS were not associated with translation or replication strategies of the various genera but they were strikingly correlated with the ability of each genus to persist in their natural host. The mechanism that underlines the association between GORS and host persistence is not yet understood. Davis et al. [64] suggested the possibility that the role of GORS is in the modulation of innate intracellular defense mechanisms, and the acquired immune system triggered by dsRNA. GORS may delay or prevent interferon induction early in viral infection or replication.",
