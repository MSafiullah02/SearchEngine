Since most endemic and emerging human pathogens utilise non\u2010human animal species at some stage in their transmission cycles (e.g. reservoir and intermediate hosts and vector species) (Taylor et al. 2001, Woolhouse and Gowtage\u2010Sequeria 2005), biogeographers and community ecologists are increasingly involved in this pursuit. Their contributions have yielded a range of novel and complementary insights on the spatial and temporal patterns of infectious disease occurrence, emergence and burden, their underlying ecological processes, and their surveillance and management (Guernier et al. 2004, Smith et al. 2007, Peterson 2008, 2014, Reperant 2010, Johnson et al. 2015, Murray et al. 2015, Stephens et al. 2016b).",

For infectious diseases, this history stretches as far back as to the time of the debate between contagionists and anticontagionists, when experts disagreed about the very existence of infectious disease\u2010causing agents; for example, several \u2018spot maps\u2019 in the context of yellow fever in the US were developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries to identify patterns and attempt to infer environmental causes for the disease, well before Pasteur and Koch's eventual and definitive development of the \u2018germ theory of disease\u2019 in the late 1800s (Howe 1989, Jones 1990, Lederberg 2000).",

Although many global health metrics, such as life expectancy and childhood mortality, have nevertheless continued to improve, researchers from a range of disciplines are increasingly forecasting a collision between ongoing improvements in human health and a range of large\u2010scale and accelerating global change processes, particularly those relating to environmental factors and declining environmental quality (Foley et al. 2005, MEA 2005, Raudsepp\u2010Hearne et al. 2010, Suk and Semenza 2011, Costanza et al. 2014, Watts et al. 2015, Whitmee et al. 2015).",

Given that this type of multi\u2010scale, multi\u2010disciplinary complexity is commonplace in biogeography, and much precedence exists from the study of parasitism, plant and animal diseases and global change ecology, there has never been a better time for biogeographers and ecologists to contribute their knowledge, theory and methods to public and global health.

Analogous to its utility for understanding wildlife distributions, biodiversity patterns and improving conservation management, biogeography has the potential to improve our understanding of infectious disease distributions, describe and explain patterns and processes underlying pathogen diversity (\u2018pathodiversity\u2019) and contribute to infectious disease forecasting, risk management and threat abatement. Through the analysis of historical disease, host and/or vector occurrence and co\u2010occurrence patterns, biogeographic approaches could even yield some of the earliest, and in some cases the only, insights into poorly known, burgeoning and future infectious disease risks (Murray et al. 2015).",

Better understanding of pathogeography among ecologists and improved biogeographic knowledge among veterinary and medical scientists and public health managers should help improve disease surveillance, combat the global burden of human infectious diseases, and improve environmental management.

This can in turn be represented as a presence (i.e. in a human host or a specific geographic unit) or some measure of relative abundance either within single hosts (e.g. the infection load, particularly for macroparasites, such as helminths), within a defined geographic area (e.g. density), time period (incidence) or within the host population (e.g. prevalence). It might also be represented to reflect the process of transmission itself (e.g. \u2018force of infection\u2019). With some information on the average impact of infections in humans, public health practitioners often also describe spatial and temporal patterns of disease in terms of \u2018burden\u2019, with various available measures that broadly seek to capture the loss of healthy life (e.g. death and disability) attributable to the presence of certain diseases within a population (e.g. disability adjusted life years, DALYs) (Murray et al. 2013). Conversely, the absence of disease is of equal interest for pattern and process analysis, but harder to obtain given the sampling difficulties of asserting freedom from disease (Cameron 2012). Furthermore, occurrence records (and its derivatives) will generally be a subset of actual occurrences, because in most cases they will be heavily influenced by observation effort. Given the diversity of health studies, all of these epidemiological metrics could be potentially relevant for pathogeographic analysis.",

When applied to pathogens, hosts and/or reservoirs and vectors, SDM is useful for understanding risk factors conditioning the distributions, emergence or the accumulation of new outbreaks of disease. In SDMs, the available information on the presence or the incidence of disease is linked to a diverse set of environmental variables and allows the evaluation of the degree to which certain environments are favourable for the occurrence of disease, even in areas where it has not been detected before. In the absence of, or in combination with, local\u2010scale data suitable for mechanistic models, SDMs can take advantage of the large geographic scale to explore macroecological processes that are able to explain and predict the occurrence of disease. This can reveal emergent patterns and processes not perceptible at the local scale (Brown 1995), and can help lay a foundation for hypothesis testing or provide a geographic context for further studies on the ground (Allen et al. 2017).",

Suitability is an idiosyncratic way of ranking local sites according to their capacity to hold the species or pathogen that is not directly related to the probability of occurrence (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000, Royle et al. 2012). In contrast, favourability values can be obtained from probability and prevalence (here defined as the proportion of presences in the set of observations) (Real et al. 2006). Probability and suitability are biased in their outputs when working with samples differing in prevalence, which is not the case with favourability (Acevedo and Real 2012). This quality of favourability enables direct comparison and combination when several species are involved in the analytical design; for example, when using models for deriving indices based on multiple species (Estrada et al. 2008), and for the study of biogeographical relationships between species (Real et al. 2009, Acevedo et al. 2010), including relationships between pathogen and host complexes (Olivero et al. 2017a).",

Modelling the distribution of biotic interactions is a relatively recent advance in macroecology and biogeography (Kissling et al. 2012, Wisz et al. 2013, Ovaskainen et al. 2016) and could similarly provide a further way forward for the analysis of pathogens with zoonotic cycles based on joint distributions and multispecies assemblages. Other methods of representing potential interactions at a community level (e.g. network modeling) or inferring potential hosts/vectors and host/vector ranges from geographic co\u2010occurrence are similarly being developed alongside (or in some cases integrated with) niche modeling approaches to yield novel insights on the spatial distribution of some infectious diseases (Stephens et al. 2009, 2016a).",

However, with the exception of using host distributions as a simple proxy for the potential distributions of pathogens (Daszak et al. 2012), the distribution of reservoir species has only recently been used as an explanatory variable, together with other environmental descriptors, to define a pathogen distribution model (e.g. compare Peterson et al.

Olivero et al. (2017a) thus addressed the mapping of favourable areas for the Ebola virus in the wild by combining two biogeographical approaches: SDM and chorotype analysis. Mammalian chorotypes in Africa were employed as surrogates of the types of distributions shown by reservoirs and any wildlife species implicated in the virus spillover cycle. Olivero et al. (2017a) found that a model based on a number of diversity patterns, each one associated with a different mammalian chorotype, defined favourable areas for the presence of Ebola virus with higher accuracy than did a model based on environmental variables alone (i.e. climate, forest type), concluding that mammalian biogeography contributes significantly to explaining the distribution of Ebola virus in Africa. In addition, vegetation was identified as a factor placing clear limits to the presence of the virus. Favourable areas for Ebola virus were thus determined from information provided by both models (Fig. 2).",

(2015) show that human infectious disease assemblages exhibit biogeographic regionalisation reminiscent of zoogeographic patterns, particularly for zoonotic (Fig. 7A, B), vector\u2010borne and parasitic diseases, and that mammalian assemblage similarity is consistently among the strongest predictors of human infectious disease assemblage similarity among countries (Fig. 7C). Such an effect is very likely predictive of as\u2010yet undescribed patterns of microbial diversity, such as the geographic structure recently demonstrated among novel coronaviruses detected in wild bat hosts (Anthony et al. 2017). In addition to this dominant explanatory effect of biodiversity, other factors, including environmental (climate, land area, population size), social (human connectivity, health expenditure, observation effort) and epidemiological characteristics (e.g. pathogen type, transmission mode) also affect infectious disease \u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010diversity patterns (Fig. 7C). The strongest \u03b2\u2010diversity patterns, for example, can be observed in zoonotic, vector\u2010borne and parasitic infectious diseases, likely due to a more dominant role of environmental factors and persistence of historical dispersal barriers limiting their geographic distributions, while patterns of human\u2010specific diseases are far more homogenous at the global scale (Smith et al. 2007, Dunn et al. 2010, Just et al. 2014, Murray et al. 2015, Jean et al. 2016) (see also Box 3 Fig. panel D).",

Nestedness occurs where species assemblages are subsets of the biotas at more diverse sites (Wright and Reeves 1992, Ulrich and Gotelli 2007), and indicates a non\u2010random process arising from any factor that promotes the orderly disaggregation of assemblages (Gaston et al. 2000). The latitudinal gradient of human infectious diseases exhibits such a pattern, with disease assemblages occurring at higher latitudes being subsets of those occurring closer to the equator (Fig. 6C) (Guernier et al. 2004). In contrast, turnover indicates the replacement of some species by others as a consequence of environmental sorting or spatial and historical constraints (Qian et al. 2005, Baselga 2010). In the only assessment of nestedness vs turnover undertaken so far for human infectious diseases that we are aware of, both nestedness and turnover appear to contribute to overall differences in infectious disease assemblages among countries at a global scale, with the relative contribution varying between major epidemiological classes (Murray et al. 2015). For example, nestedness dominates differences in human\u2010specific diseases, whereas turnover dominates differences in zoonotic and vector\u2010borne diseases.",
