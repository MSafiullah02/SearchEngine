Many of these avian influenza virus infections have occurred in children, and unlike seasonal influenza, the most severe disease and highest death rates have occurred in children and young adults.

Influenza is an important respiratory pathogen in young children, with the greatest morbidity and rates of hospitalization in young infants [4, 5] . Several features of the biology of the influenza virus allow novel viruses to emerge into the human population, causing pandemics such as the 1918 \"Spanish flu\" pandemic. In recent years, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) have crossed the species barrier and caused human infections with very high mortality. Of major concern to pediatricians is the fact that severe disease has occurred even in previously healthy children, a phenomenon quite distinct from seasonal influenza. HPAI viruses have the potential to cause a pandemic of virulent influenza that would have far greater effects on children than either seasonal influenza or historical pandemics.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 144, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 145, "end": 148, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 149, "end": 152, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 299, "end": 301, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Influenza viruses are enveloped viruses, containing a segmented RNA genome, and are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza viruses are divided into three types: A, B, and C. Types A and B cause most human influenza in annual winter epidemics. Influenza A viruses are further divided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. The WHO nomenclature for classification of influenza strains is as follows: Type (A, B, or C)/Geographic origin/Isolate #/Year of isolation/subtype (HA and NA); e.g. A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2). There are 16 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes; HA 1, 2, and 3, and NA 1 and 2 typically circulate in humans. HA is the viral protein that binds to sialic acid on host cells and is a major determinant of species tropism. The HA proteins of the types that usually circulate in humans (H1, H2 and H3) preferentially bind to the particular sialic acid moieties present on human respiratory epithelial cells. Conversely, HA in viruses that circulate in birds bind with far greater affinity to sialic acid moieties present in avian cells. The other HA and NA subtypes primarily circulate in migratory shore birds, with a few subtypes occurring naturally in horses. This provides a reservoir of novel influenza HA and NA subtypes in nature to which humans have no pre-existing immunity. The mechanisms of influenza virus replication allow for two additional sources of viral mutation, to evade host immunity or introduce completely novel subtypes. The influenza virus genome consists of segmented, single-stranded RNA molecules. The RNA polymerase enzyme that copies the genome to produce progeny virions is error-prone and, unlike DNA polymerases, has no inherent proofreading activity to correct mistakes. This leads to point mutations and progressive variation in protein sequences called 'antigenic drift'. Furthermore, viruses with segmented genomes can exchange or reassort genome segments when two different viruses infect the same cell. Reassortment leads to a complete change of the HA or NA proteins. If the new type has not circulated in humans recently, there is no pre-existing immunity in the population. The encoding of HA and NA by separate RNA molecules facilitates the reassortment of these genes in animals simultaneously infected by two different subtypes. For example, H3N1 virus has been recovered from pigs simultaneously infected with swine flu virus (H1N1) and the Hong King virus (H3N2) [6]. This abrupt change of a major immune target is called 'antigenic shift' and is a major source of pandemic strains of influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influenza virus"}, {"text": "Pandemic influenza is defined as virulent human influenza that causes a global outbreak, or pandemic, of serious illness. There are three requirements for a pandemic: (1) novel HA or NA types (thus no pre-existing immunity in population); (2) a highly virulent strain of influenza virus; and (3) easy human-to-human spread. A worldwide influenza pandemic occurred in 1918. At least 21 million people (possibly 50-100 million) worldwide died from the \u201aSpanish flu' -the most devastating plague in human history. Many of the deaths were in healthy young adults and two-thirds occurred during a 4-month period [7, 8] . The propensity for high mortality in previously healthy young adults was a very unusual feature of the 1918 influenza virus. Routine seasonal influenza viruses cause the highest mortality in the very young (< 6 months of age) and the elderly (> 65 years old). The increased virulence of the 1918 virus in healthy young persons has been hypothesized to be due to a \"cytokine storm\", but the biological mechanisms are not known. This has disturbing parallels to the mortality pattern exhibited by the recent H5N1 avian influenza viruses (see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 607, "end": 610, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 611, "end": 613, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pandemic influenza"}, {"text": "Two pandemics of influenza have swept the world since the \"Spanish flu\" of 1918 (H1N1): the \"Asian\" flu pandemic of 1957 (H2N2) and the \"Hong Kong\" flu pandemic of 1968 (H3N2). These pandemics were milder, with an estimated 2 million deaths in 1957 and 1 million deaths in 1968. These data suggest that flu pandemics occur when the virus acquires a new HA and/or NA. The pandemic of 1957 probably infected more people than 1918. However, the availability of antibiotics to treat the secondary infections that are the usual cause of death resulted in a much lower death rate.

Phylogenetic analysis of the genomic sequence data suggests that the 1918 virus was derived from an avian-like influenza virus a short time (perhaps a few years) before the start of the pandemic, but the origin is still not known. This virus has been recreated in a highly secure biocontainment facility at the CDC using the technique of reverse engineering [15] . Studies of this recreated 1918 virus in mice suggested that the HA and NA from the 1918 strain are major determinants of virulence [15] . The contribution of other genes to virulence has not been completely determined [12, [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, this work suggests that a reassortant human influenza virus containing only an HA and/or NA gene from a highly virulent strain could cause severe disease and high mortality similar to that caused by the 1918 virus.

There have been over 200 cases of human disease due to H5N1 influenza to date, with an overall 57% mortality (Tab. 1). Most of the deaths have been in previously healthy young adults and children, suggesting that H5N1 possesses significantly greater virulence than usual seasonal influenza. Again, for H5N1, virtually all cases have occurred in those with close contacts to poultry, with only a few likely cases of person-to-person transmission [24] [25] [26] . Viral determinants of virulence of the H5N1 strain have been established in birds and mice, and include a polybasic HA cleavage site (containing multiple basic amino acids) and point mutations in HA and the RNA polymerase [27] . Influenza HA must be cleaved by host proteases to be active, and normally is cleaved only by enzymes present in the respiratory tract. HPAI viruses have a polybasic HA cleavage site that is cleaved by enzymes present in many cells, thus allowing spread beyond the respiratory tract. The polybasic cleavage site also determines virulence in ferrets and cats [28] [29] [30] [31] .

The reported case series from Thailand showed a nonsignificant trend towards better outcome with earlier oseltamivir treatment [41] . The major limitations to the use of neuraminidase inhibitors is likely to be unavailability due to limited production capacity, and prohibitive price for under-resourced countries. The manufacturing process for oseltamivir is complex and time consuming. Although the manufacturing capacity of oseltamivir has recently quadrupled, it will take a decade to produce enough oseltamivir to treat 20% of the world's population.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 608, "end": 612, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 707, "end": 711, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 712, "end": 715, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 910, "end": 914, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 915, "end": 918, "text": "52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1773, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1774, "end": 1777, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2054, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment"}, {"text": "The majority of H5N1-related human deaths have been due to severe pneumonia, multiorgan system dysfunction and shock resulting directly from the virus, and thus cannot be prevented with antibiotics.

Recombinant viral-vectored vaccines encoding influenza HA have been constructed from fowlpox and vaccinia viruses [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . These vaccines have shown efficacy in chickens against both low-and high-pathogenicity strains. However, safety concerns makes translation of these results to human trials difficult. Traditional influenza vaccines grown in eggs and chemically inactivated ('killed' vaccine) have been the mainstay of preventive strategies in commercial poultry [60, 61] . This is essentially the same method used to produce human influenza vaccines. Recent studies have reported the use of reverse engineering to produce vaccine strains in cultured cells that bear modified genes to attenuate virulence [62, 63] . The reverse engineering technique is very promising in that it allows vaccines to be 'tailor-made' to respond to variation in field strain HA or NA proteins, and the potential to modify virus genes to alter virulence or replication characteristics [62, [64] [65] [66] [67] . However, major limitations of both traditional and reverse-engineering approaches are: (a) the requirement to develop vaccine seed strains that replicate to high titers in embryonated eggs; (b) the necessity for vaccine production in eggs, where one egg yields approximately one dose; and (c) the purification required for egg-produced vaccine and concerns regarding poultry-associated infectious agents, such as Salmonella. Recent studies of cell-culture produced influenza vaccines may alleviate some of these obstacles [62, [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 232, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 233, "end": 237, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 238, "end": 242, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 243, "end": 247, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 599, "end": 603, "text": "[60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 604, "end": 607, "text": "61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 841, "end": 845, "text": "[62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 846, "end": 849, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1104, "text": "[62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1109, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1114, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1119, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1124, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1653, "text": "[62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1654, "end": 1658, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1663, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1668, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1669, "end": 1673, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1678, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vaccines"}, {"text": "Clinical trials have been conducted with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine produced using a combination of traditional and reverse-engineering methods [73] .
