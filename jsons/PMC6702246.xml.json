The PI did not perform an independent physical exam but some findings were evident on visual inspection during the ultrasound (tachypnea, work of breathing, diaphoresis, abdominal distention, etc.), so the PI was not overall blinded to the clinical findings. Ultrasound findings were communicated to the treating team, after which the treating team reassessed post-ultrasound presumed diagnoses, ranked their confidence in the leading diagnosis. Follow-up was done to obtain diagnosis at discharge for the enrolled participants. The hospital diagnosis at discharge was used as the standard for comparison in determining the accuracy of the pre- and post-ultrasound diagnoses. The lead sonographer received dedicated ultrasound training over a 3-year period, was enrolled in an ultrasound fellowship and had passed an ultrasound observed structured clinical skills assessment prior to leading this study. Another ultrasound-fellowship trained investigator for quality assurance purposes reviewed random samples of 5% studies and there was no discordance with interpretation. A SonoSite M-Turbo\u00ae ultrasound machine (FUJIFILM SonoSite, Inc, Bothell, WA) was utilized to scan patients, and ultrasound clips were saved on a flash drive and then stored on an external hard disk. We used REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a web-based electronic capture to enter and store the data [16].",
