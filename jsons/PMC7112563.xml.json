After penetration into the cytoplasm, the genome migrates to the nucleus where it undergoes the processes of gene expression and replication. In productive infection, HCMV gene expression is a temporally coordinated and regulated cascade of transcriptional events that lead to the synthesis of three classes of viral proteins designated as immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L). Transcription of the L genes occurs after genome replication. HCMV gene transcription and genome replication are catalyzed by the cellular RNA polymerase II and by the viral DNA polymerase, respectively. The latter enzyme is the target of most licensed anti-HCMV drugs.",

This review will examine the early events of HCMV replication as targets for the development of novel anti-HCMV therapies. The processes of HCMV attachment, entry, and IE genes expression will be described. A special emphasis will be placed on molecules that inhibit these processes, discussing their mechanism of action, their therapeutical potential, and their drawbacks.",

            "text": "HCMV infections occur in all geographic locations and socioeconomic groups, although high population density and low sanitary conditions increase the risk of being infected (Cannon et al., 2010). HCMV can be transmitted via saliva, sexual activity, placental transfer, breastfeeding, blood transfusion, and solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After primary infection, HCMV establishes a lifelong latent infection that can periodically reactivate with shedding of infectious virus in body fluids (i.e., urine, saliva, tears, milk, semen, and cervical secretions) for months to years. In healthy individuals, HCMV infections are efficiently controlled by host immune responses and usually run asymptomatically, except for some cases of mononucleosis-like syndrome. Other rare complications of primary HCMV infections in immunocompetent individuals include arthralgia and arthritis, ulcerative colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, aseptic meningitis, and myocarditis (Gandhi & Khanna, 2004). By contrast, HCMV is responsible of severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals like those with untreated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive agents. Retinitis is the primary manifestation of HCMV infection in AIDS patients with low CD4+ T-cell counts, while transplant recipients are at great risk of developing pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease or to suffer an acute graft rejection (Gandhi and Khanna, 2004, Steininger et al., 2006, Buyck et al., 2010). In addition, HCMV is the most common cause of congenital infections. In HCMV-seronegative pregnant women, HCMV can be transmitted from mother to fetus in approximately 32% of cases. About 12.7% of infected newborns manifest symptoms at birth or during the first year of life. These include birth defects and developmental disabilities, such as microcephaly, hearing loss, vision loss, and mental retardation (Dollard et al., 2007, Kenneson and Cannon, 2007).",

To date, a very few antiviral drugs have been developed and employed for either prophylactic or pre-emptive therapies and for direct treatment of HCMV disease. Five compounds are currently licensed to treat established HCMV infections: ganciclovir (GCV), its oral prodrug valganciclovir (VGCV), foscarnet (FOS), cidofovir (CDV), and fomivirsen. High-dose acyclovir (ACV), and more recently valaciclovir (VACV), have also been used for prophylaxis against HCMV in transplant recipients, while they are not recommended for treatment of active HCMV disease. No antiviral agent has been approved as yet for the treatment of congenital HCMV infections. With the exception of fomivirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide that is directed against the HCMV Major Immediate-Early (MIE) gene locus (see Section 4.4.2 for a description of fomivirsen), all the other compounds target, either directly or indirectly, the viral DNA polymerase (Yeh & Coen, 2004).",

            "text": "Ganciclovir [9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine; Fig. 1\n] was the first antiviral agent approved for treatment of HCMV infections, and remains the first-line choice for the treatment of HCMV diseases (Markham and Faulds, 1994, Razonable and Emery, 2004). GCV is an acyclic nucleoside analog of 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine and is a prodrug. In HCMV-infected cells, GCV undergoes a first step of phosphorylation by the viral UL97 protein kinase and is then converted by cellular kinases to the active triphosphate form (GCV-TP) (Littler et al., 1992, Sullivan et al., 1992). GCV-TP interacts with the catalytic subunit (UL54) of the viral DNA polymerase and inhibits DNA synthesis by competing with the natural nucleoside triphosphate dGTP and acting as a chain terminator. GCV inhibits the viral polymerase more potently than the cellular DNA polymerase \u03b1. Mutations conferring resistance to GCV have been mapped to both UL54 (DNA polymerase) and UL97 (protein kinase) genes. The mutations associated with resistance to GCV generally map in the conserved subdomains of UL54, and can confer cross-resistance to CDV, or less commonly to FOS (Gilbert & Boivin, 2005). Before the introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy, the emergence of resistant strains was a major concern in AIDS patients who received a prolonged maintenance therapy (Erice et al., 1989, Lurain et al., 1994, Baldanti et al., 1995, Baldanti et al., 1998). Currently, drug-resistance still represents an important problem in transplant recipients (Lurain & Chou, 2010). The side effects of GCV include hematologic abnormalities (primarily neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) and, based on preclinical toxicologic studies, probable long-term reproductive toxicity (Faulds and Heel, 1990, Markham and Faulds, 1994). GCV is currently available as an intravenous formulation (Cytovene IV\u00ae, Roche) and as a sustained-release intraocular implant (Vitrasert\u00ae, Baush & Lomb) approved for the treatment of HCMV retinitis. A GCV oral formulation (250 and 500 mg capsules; Cytovene\u00ae, Roche) received approval in 1994 for treatment of HCMV retinitis, but only as maintenance therapy. Although the oral formulation represented an important advance in treatment options for maintenance and prophylactic therapies, the low bioavailability (approximately 5%) and the high pill burden from the t.i.d. (three times a day) regimen posed severe limitations. In fact, oral GCV is no longer marketed.",

FOS is a pyrophosphate analog that inhibits the viral DNA polymerase (Chrisp and Clissold, 1991, Wagstaff and Bryson, 1994). Differently from GCV and CDV, it does not require prior activation by virus-encoded or cellular enzymes. It binds to the pyrophosphate binding site and blocks the cleavage of the pyrophosphate group from the terminal nucleoside triphosphate added to the growing DNA chain. Point mutations conferring resistance to FOS have been mapped in UL54 gene. Moreover, cross-resistance has been observed between GCV and FOS in several laboratory and clinical isolates. FOS is available as Foscavir\u00ae (AstraZeneca), the trisodium salt of phosphonoformic acid, which is administered intravenously. FOS is considered a second-line therapy; however, it is the drug of choice for patients failing GCV therapy due to viral resistance, or for those who cannot be treated with GCV due to dose-limiting neutropenia or leucopenia (Razonable & Emery, 2004). Due to its potential nephrotoxicity, its administration requires slow infusion, extensive prehydration, and frequent monitoring of serum creatinine levels (Naesens & De Clercq, 2001).",

It has a mechanism of action similar to that of GCV, but, being an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, is not dependent on activation by a virus-encoded enzyme for activity. It is converted by cellular kinases to the diphosphoryl form, which then acts as an inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase, causing premature chain termination in viral DNA synthesis (De Clercq & Holy, 2005). CDV was approved in 1996 for treatment of HCMV retinitis in AIDS patients. CDV is available only as an intravenous formulation (Vistide\u00ae, Gilead), because its oral bioavailability is very low (less than 5%). One of its advantages compared with GCV and FOS is its long intracellular half-life (Aduma et al., 1995); as such, good efficacy can be achieved with infrequent dosing. The major limitation of CDV is its severe renal toxicity, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance (Lea & Bryson, 1996); in fact, it requires coadministration of probenecid and prehydratation to reduce the nephrotoxic effects. Neutropenia is another side-effect that can be associated with CDV, and it was also shown to be both carcinogenic and teratogenic in preclinical toxicological studies (Lea & Bryson, 1996). For all these reasons, CDV remains a second-line therapy. The potential of CDV prodrugs to avoid renal tubular uptake and concentration is under evaluation.",

Like GCV, ACV is a prodrug that is phosphorylated by UL97 and subsequently by cellular kinases to the triphosphate form, the active form that promotes chain termination of the growing viral DNA. ACV is a less efficient substrate than GCV; in addition, ACV-TP displays a shorter half-life compared to GCV-TP in infected cells, resulting in lower intracellular levels of the active drug. Probably for these reasons, ACV exhibits a lower in vitro potency compared to GCV in HCMV-infected cells. Like for GCV, drug resistance arises from mutations in UL54 or UL97 genes. Valaciclovir (Valtrex\u00ae, GlaxoSmithKline; Fig. 1) is the l-valyl ester of ACV (Lowance et al., 1999) and presents higher bioavailability (55% compared to 6\u201310% of oral ACV) (Perry & Faulds, 1996). Both ACV and VACV lack sufficient potency to be used for treatment of active HCMV disease. Their primary use in transplant patients has been for suppression of HSV reactivation, but prophylactic treatment with these drugs can also reduce the occurrence of HCMV infection and diseases in solid organ transplant recipients. In particular, VACV has been approved in several countries for prophylaxis of HCMV infections in renal or heart transplant recipients.",

In addition, the currently approved systemic drugs have an unfavorable safety profile, with severe acute and long-term toxicities. Of special concern for a pediatric population is long-term reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity. The emergence of drug-resistant viral strains also poses an increasing problem for disease management. Since most of the approved anti-HCMV compounds share a similar mechanism of action, targeting the viral DNA polymerase, mutant viruses resistant to one drug can sometime be resistant to others, although this is not a rule. Finally, the safety and efficacy of the currently available drugs in the treatment of congenital HCMV infection are still the subject of some debate despite the results from randomized controlled trials (see for example Kimberlin et al., 2003). Thus, there is still a strong need to identify new targets for anti-HCMV chemotherapy and to develop novel antiviral compounds and treatment strategies.",

More recently, a new class of semi-synthetic polysaccharides emerged as potent inhibitors of viral attachment, i.e., the sulfated derivatives of E. coli K5 capsular polysaccharide. As they are active against three sexually transmitted viruses, namely human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus, and herpes simplex virus types-1 and -2 (HSV-1 and -2), they are promising candidates as ingredients in topical microbicides (Vicenzi et al., 2003, Lembo et al., 2008, Pinna et al., 2008, Rusnati et al., 2009). The capsular K5 polysaccharide from E. coli has the same structure as the heparin/HS biosynthetic precursor, the N-acetyl-heparosan. This observation represented the starting point for the synthesis of K5 derivatives by chemical or enzymatic methods. Indeed, the addition of sulfate groups at the N- or O-position of the sugars led to the synthesis of chemically defined compounds with different degrees of sulfation and charge distribution (Rusnati et al., 2005). Unlike heparin and other sulfated polysaccharides, they are devoid of anticoagulant activity and can be tailored in structure and molecular weight to closely mimic cell surface HS and to obtain a good toxicological profile. Very recently, a panel of K5 derivatives was tested against HCMV and some of them proved active (Mercorelli et al., 2010). The most active compound, K5-N,OS(H), higly sulfated at both the N- and O-positions, was able to potently inhibit the replication of laboratory HCMV strains, of clinical viral isolates, and of virus strains resistant to the anti-HCMV drugs currently used for therapy. Moreover, K5-N,OS(H) inhibited the cell-to-cell spread of the virus.",

            "text": "Taken as a group, sulfated polysaccharides have emerged as broad spectrum antiviral compounds and some of them entered in clinical trials as active ingredients of topical microbicides for the prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV (Rusnati et al., 2009). However, they appear less attractive to treat systemic infections like those sustained by HCMV. A major undesired effect associated with the use of many sulfated polysaccharides in vivo is their anticoagulant activity. However, a number of compounds that have minimal or no effect on plasma coagulation could be selected, including fucoidan, galactan, spirulan, xylomannan, heteroglycan, and K5 derivatives (Hayashi et al., 1996a, Ghosh et al., 2004, Rusnati et al., 2005, Adhikari et al., 2006, Chattopadhyay et al., 2007\nMandal et al., 2008, Chattopadhyay et al., 2008). Among these, fucoidan, spirulan, and K5 derivatives are active against HCMV (Table 1). Another factor that limits the use of sulfated polysaccharides in vivo is poor bioavailability (Flexner et al., 1991), although some of them can be adsorbed after oral administration (Ghosh et al., 2009). The only sulfated polysaccharide that showed anti-HCMV activity in humans is the semi-synthetic compound curdlan sulfate, a potent anti-HIV inhibitor in vitro (Gordon et al., 1994). In a 21-day intravenous tolerance study in HIV- and HCMV-infected individuals, 12 out of 21 patients tested were HCMV-negative at the end of 21 days and curdlan sulfate was well tolerated (Gordon et al., 1997).",

            "text": "Two peptide-derivatized dendrimers, named SB105 and SB105_A10, were recently reported as potent inhibitors of HCMV attachment (Luganini et al., 2010). They consist of a lysine peptidyl branching core and four covalently attached surface peptide functional units, containing clusters of basic amino acids that bind to the negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups of HS. Indeed, SB105 and its derivative SB105_A10, in which the C-terminal glutamine residue of the functional ASLRVRIKKQ group was removed, could bind heparin immobilized on a BIAcore sensor chip, a \u201ccell-free\u201d model that resembles interaction with cell surface HS (Donalisio et al., 2010). Moreover, binding of SB105 and SB105_A10 to cell surface was prevented by soluble heparin as well as by pretreatment with heparinase I or heparitinase I (Luganini et al., 2010), indicating the ability of these dendrimers to bind cellular HS. This mode of action allows SB105 and SB105_A10 to prevent attachment by several HCMV strains (including GCV-resistant clinical isolates) to both primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Indeed, pretreatment of HELF cells with SB105 and SB105_A10 produced a significant inhibition of HCMV AD169 replication (EC50: 0.22 and 0.29 \u03bcM, respectively). This effect is neither virus strain specific nor cell type specific since it was also observed in HELFs infected with the clinical isolate AL-1 (EC50: 0.23 \u03bcM for SB105 and 0.25 \u03bcM for SB105_A10) and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells infected with the endotheliotropic VR1814 strain (EC50: 0.24 and 0.34 \u03bcM, respectively).",

SB105 and SB105_A10 are attractive molecules due to their small size (nanometric), their ability to display multiple copies of active surface groups (multivalency), and their high anti -HCMV potency. Moreover, as they target a cellular component, the emergence of HCMV resistant strains could be less likely. However, a possible drawback of their mode of action is the induction of undesired cellular signaling cascades or the alteration of cellular responses. As HS interact with a variety of extracellular ligands and participate in many events during cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (Perrimon and Bernfield, 2000, Tumova et al., 2000), this issue should be throughly addressed in preclinical studies before candidating SB105 and SB105_A10 as antiviral molecules for the prevention and/or control of HCMV infections.",

            "text": "It was proposed that the activity of LF occurs at the level of virus attachment and entry, since preincubation of target cells with LF is essential, while the protective effect decreases if LF is added after infection (Harmsen et al., 1995, Beljaars et al., 2004). The N-terminal portion of the protein, called lactoferricin, is required for antiviral activity and contains a stretch of positively charged amino acids that bind to HSPGs (van Berkel et al., 1997, Swart et al., 1999, Andersen et al., 2001). Moreover, addition of positive charges to LF through amination increases its anti-HCMV effects, whereas negatively charged acylated derivatives of LF are devoid of this activity (Swart et al., 1999, Beljaars et al., 2004). Finally, preincubation of LF with heparin mutually blocks each other's antiviral activity (Andersen et al., 2001). Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the anti-HCMV activity of LF requires a specific distribution of positive and negative charges within the molecule, and suggest that at least part of the antiviral activity may be accomplished by preventing the virus from docking onto the cell surface HSPGs and entry into the cell. However, the mechanism of action of LF against HCMV remains to be fully elucidated.",

By contrast, combination with ACV or FOS resulted in antagonism, whereas neither synergy nor antagonism was observed when LF was combined with GCV. Although the mechanism of these interactions remains to be elucidated, a combination therapy consisting of LF with CDV deserves further investigation in vivo. The anti-HCMV activity of LF was studied in vivo in rat cytomegalovirus models with and without immune suppression (Beljaars et al., 2004). A moderate antiviral effect was observed that might be explained by a suboptimal dosage regimen of LF or by the presence of antibodies against LF. The latter factor is unlikely to play a role in humans treated with human LF. An earlier study demonstrated the ability of LF to inhibit murine cytomegalovirus replication in vivo by stimulating the activity of natural killer cells (Shimizu et al., 1996). By contrast, the study by Beljaars and colleagues indicated that the contribution of the immunomodulatory activity of LF to the overall antiviral activity is less important as compared to the direct inhibitory effects on HCMV attachment and entry (Beljaars et al., 2004).",

They are widespread in nature, being fruits, tea, and soybean the most important dietary source for humans. All these compounds possess a marked antioxidant effect (Heim et al., 2002). Beside this property, many reports proposed additional biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, vasculoprotective, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects (Formica and Regelson, 1995, Cushnie and Lamb, 2005, Friedman, 2007, Rathee et al., 2009, Androutsopoulos et al., 2010). Indeed, different flavonoids inhibit replication of a wide array of viruses in vitro, including HSV, poliovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Sindbis virus, parainfluenza virus, pseudorabies virus, Rous sarcoma virus, SARS coronavirus, influenza virus, and HIV (Amoros et al., 1992, Hayashi et al., 1997, Lin et al., 1999, Mitrocotsa et al., 2000, Robin et al., 2001, Akula et al., 2002, Chiang et al., 2003, Wei et al., 2004, Yi et al., 2004, Cos et al., 2008). These observations, along with the fact that various flavonoids affect cellular signaling pathways that are required for HCMV replication, e.g. those in which phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinases are involved, stimulated the search of flavonoids endowed with anti-HCMV activity. A study by Evers et al. (2005) identified nine flavonoids that block the replication of the HCMV strain Towne. Among these, baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone) was the most potent inhibitor (EC50: 1.2 \u03bcM). This compound was originally isolated from the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis, an herb widely used in Chinese traditional medicine for treatment of chronic hepatitis, allergy, thrombotic stroke, and inflammatory diseases (Shang et al., 2010). Several studies confirmed a potent anti-inflammatory effect of baicalein (Sekiya and Okuda, 1982, Huang et al., 1994, Chen et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2005). As far as the anti-HCMV activity, it was demonstrated that baicalein acts prior to IE protein expression. Its primary mechanism of action is to inhibit HCMV entry by blocking EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, a cellular function required for HCMV penetration (Wang et al., 2003, Chan et al., 2009). Safety and efficacy issues remain to be addressed in vivo (see also next section).",

            "text": "Resveratrol (3,5,4\u2032-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a natural compound produced by several plants in response to bacterial or fungal infections or other stresses. It is found in the skin of red grapes, in red wine, in plums, and in peanuts, which represent primary dietary sources of resveratrol for humans. Moreover, it can be produced by chemical synthesis (Farina et al., 2006) or by an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Trantas et al., 2009). Many studies reported a beneficial effect of resveratrol in the prevention or in slowing the progression of inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer (Baur & Sinclair, 2006). It was also shown that resveratrol inhibits infection by several viruses in vitro including HSV-1 and -2, varicella-zoster virus, SARS coronavirus, and influenza virus (Docherty et al., 1999, Palamara et al., 2005, Docherty et al., 2006, Li et al., 2006). Moreover, it was active in combination therapy against HIV (Heredia et al., 2000). In vivo studies in mice showed that topical administration of resveratrol inhibits HSV replication in the vagina and limits extra-vaginal disease (Docherty et al., 2004, Docherty et al., 2005). The anti-HCMV activity of resveratrol was initially documented in 2002 and then confirmed in 2004 during a screening of a panel of stilbenes and related compounds (Atreides et al., 2002, Evers et al., 2004). The latter study reported an EC50 of 1.7 \u03bcM for resveratrol against the HCMV strain Towne, with a selectivity index of at least 50. The other stilbenes or stilbene-like compounds examinated lacked of antiviral activity suggesting that the phenolic hydroxyl groups of resveratrol are required for such activity. Investigation of its mode of action revealed that resveratrol acts within the first 4 h of infection and prevents IE genes expression. It was found that resveratrol blocks a number of cellular events triggered by HCMV early after infection (Evers et al., 2004). These include EGFR phosphorylation, PI3K signaling and the activation of the transcription factors Sp1 and Nuclear Factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) (Johnson et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2003). In light of these findings, the authors proposed that the primary mechanism of action of resveratrol against HCMV is to block EGFR activation, thus preventing virus entry. The efficacy of resveratrol as an anti-HCMV agent remains to be investigated in vivo. Its pharmacokinetics and short half-life and the fact that it is extensively metabolized in the body may require a high intake of resveratrol to achieve antiviral activity (Baur & Sinclair, 2006). Like some anticancer drugs (e.g., etoposide and doxorubicin), resveratrol and flavonoids (including baicalein) inhibit the activity of cellular DNA topoisomerase, raising concerns about their carcinogenic potential for the fetus, which has insufficient detoxification systems (Jo et al., 2006, Leone et al., 2010). Indeed, high intake of polyphenol/flavonoid compounds during pregnancy is suspected to increase the risk of infant and early childhood leukemia by causing site-specific DNA cleavage in the MLL gene (Ross, 2000, Strick et al., 2000, Paolini et al., 2003, Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn-Khosrovani et al., 2007, Azarova et al., 2010). These safety issues discourage the development of polyphenols as drugs for the treatment of HCMV infection in pregnant women.",

CFI02 emerged as a potent and selective inhibitor of HCMV. At a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3, its EC50 against the HCMV AD169 strain was 0.04 \u03bcM (determined with an automated assay), while its EC90 was 0.12 \u03bcM in yield reduction assays. At MOI of 1 or 3, the EC90 increased only 1.5- and 2.5-fold, respectively. In addition, CFI02 prevented cell-to-cell spread of HCMV. In a cytotoxicity assay, the 50% cytotoxic concentration of CFI02 was >50 \u03bcM. Thus, its selectivity index is >2000. Of interest, the antiviral activity of CFI02 is very specific: neither HSV, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, nor the closely related beta-herpesviruses murine CMV, simian CMV, and rat CMV are inhibited by CFI02. Mechanism-of-action studies revealed that CFI02 acts within the first 2 h of the HCMV replication cycle and remains effective when added after attachment. CFI02 prevents cytoplasm-to-nucleus transport of virions and viral IE/E gene expression. Its inhibitory effect can be reversed with polyethylene glycol, a chemical mediator of membrane fusion. Moreover, mutant viruses resistant to CFI02 bear mutations in gB that are sufficient to confer resistance. Taken together, these findings indicated that CFI02 prevents HCMV entry by inhibiting gB-mediated virion envelope fusion with the cell plasma membrane.",

            "text": "The successful development of the HIV entry inhibitor Enfuvirtide for clinical use encouraged the rational design of peptides as inhibitors of HCMV entry. Enfuvirtide is a synthetic peptide of 36-amino acids corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat segment of the HIV fusion protein gp41 (Kilby et al., 1998). The heptad repeat motif consists of a seven-amino-acid pattern in which hydrophobic side chains occur at the first and fourth position. This structural motif is the basis of a common mode of helix association in proteins, namely the \u03b1-helical coiled-coil (Lupas, 1996). A heptad repeat motif was also identified in a region of HCMV gB and gH glycoproteins and it was proposed to play a role in HCMV fusion mechanisms (Lopper & Compton, 2004). In support to this hypothesis, it was demonstrated that peptides corresponding to these regions prevent entry of a variety of clinical and laboratory HCMV strains in a specific manner (Lopper & Compton, 2004). These findings validated the heptad repeat motif as a target for the development of HCMV entry inhibitors, although the peptides displayed a low potency compared to that of Enfuvirtide. Thus, alternative strategies were explored to disrupt coiled-coil interactions. A promising line of research was opened by the rational development of \u03b2-amino-acid oligomers (\u03b2-peptides) designed to inhibit gB-mediated HCMV entry (English et al., 2005). These peptides display a secondary structure called 12-helix that mimicks putative \u03b1-helical segments within the gB glycoprotein. Some \u03b2-peptides were identified as highly specific inhibitors of HCMV entry that probably act by altering the viral fusion machinery (English et al., 2005). The intrinsic advantages of \u03b2-peptides with respect to the gB-derived \u03b1-peptides are a higher antiviral potency and resistance to proteolytic degradation. Further studies are however required to determine their therapeutical potential.",

            "text": "CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) are synthetic, single-stranded DNA fragments that contain unmethylated cytosine\u2013guanosine (CpG) dinucleotides (Krieg, 2006). CpG dinucleotides are relatively common in viral and bacterial genomes and are recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern by Toll-like receptor 9. Therefore, either genomes containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides or CpG ODNs trigger an immunomodulatory cascade that results in the secretion of a variety of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines and in the activation of innate and adaptative immune responses. These properties stimulated the development of CpG ODNs as vaccine adjuvants and suggested their potential for protecting against viral infections in a non-specific manner (Ashkar et al., 2003, Dong et al., 2003, Schlaepfer et al., 2004, Wong et al., 2005, Kamstrup et al., 2006, Krieg, 2006, Jiang et al., 2011). CpG ODNs belong to three different classes, i.e., A, B, and C, on the basis of distinct structural and biological features. Very recently, Luganini and colleagues reported that the prototype B class CpG 2006 and other related ODNs display a potent and selective anti-HCMV activity (EC50: 0.02 \u03bcM against HCMV AD169) (Luganini et al., 2008a). Studies with mutant versions of CpG 2006 revealed that its activity is independent from the presence of CpG dinucleotides but requires a phosphorothioate backbone. Interestingly, CpG 2006 exerts its antiviral activity by blocking virus entry with a mechanism that does not involve the activation of Toll-like Receptor 9 pathway (Luganini et al., 2008a). This novel mode of action of CpG 2006 may represent a starting point for the development of anti-HCMV strategies based on phosphorothioate-modified ODNs. Importantly, a number of studies carried out on rodents and humans revealed a good safety profile of CpG ODNs (Krieg, 2006).",

            "text": "Passive immunization with HCMV hyperimmune globulin is a feasible strategy for the prophylaxis of HCMV infections and to prevent symptomatic HCMV diseases. Currently, three preparations of intravenous immunoglobulin enriched for antibodies against HCMV are available on the market: Cytogam (CSL Behring), Cytotect (Biotests AG), and a preparation produced by the Australian Red Cross blood service. These products contain high titers of neutralizing antibodies that prevent HCMV entry into endothelial and epithelial cells (Cui et al., 2008). A number of studies and clinical trials support the use of HCMV hyperimmune globulin for the prophylaxis of HCMV diseases in solid organ transplant recipients, either alone or in combination with GCV (Snydman, 2001, Valantine et al., 2001, Bonaros et al., 2008). By contrast, their use in hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is still controversial (Raanani et al., 2008). Passive immunization with CMV hyperimmune globulin has also been studied for the in utero treatment and prevention of congenital HCMV infections. Preclinical studies were based mostly on the guinea pig model of cytomegalovirus infection because the guinea pig CMV crosses the placenta causing infection to the fetus like HCMV in humans. Moreover, the guinea pig and human placenta are similar (Schleiss, 2008). Improved perinatal outcomes after treatment of congenital guinea pig CMV infection were observed, paving the way to clinical trials in humans (Griffith et al., 1985, Bratcher et al., 1995). When administered to pregnant women with a primary CMV infection, HCMV hyperimmune globulin has shown promising results for both the treatment and the prevention of fetal infection (Adler & Nigro, 2009). However, randomized, blinded, controlled trials are needed to assess the benefits of passive immunization with HCMV hyperimmune globulin in HCMV congenital infections.",

Both groups utilized immortalized B cells from HCMV-immune donors as a source of antibodies. Immunoglobulins produced by these B cells are expected to be highly relevant for the body's defense against HCMV, and therefore provide a favorable starting point for generation of highly protective mAbs. Funaro and colleagues developed an innovative technology and exploited it to generate a panel of mAbs that neutralize HCMV infection of fibroblasts or endothelial cells with a potency about 20-fold higher than that of commercially available HCMV hyperimmune globulins (Funaro et al., 2008). The most active mAbs showed a strong binding to the gB or the gH viral glycoproteins. The VH and VL variable regions of the most promising candidate mAb were cloned, sequenced, and used to generate a recombinant IgG that displayed a neutralizing activity similar to that of the parental mAb. Macagno and colleagues were able to generate extremely potent mAbs that neutralize HCMV infection in endothelial, epithelial, and myeloid cells with EC90 values in the low pM range (Macagno et al., 2010). Most of them bind to conformational epitopes made up by the gH/gL/UL128-131A complex. In conclusion, human natural or recombinant mAbs are promising candidates for passive immunotherapy endowed with higher potency than that of hyperimmune immunoglobulins and devoid of the risk of unwanted transmission of infectious pathogens associated with the use of plasma derivatives. Moreover, they are expected to avoid some of the side effects of humanized and mouse mAbs, including immunogenicity, a rapid removal from the blood, and systemic inflammatory effects.",

The tegument proteins that most likely are involved in genome-containing capsid transport to the nucleus are pUL48, pUL47, and perhaps pp150/UL32.

The viral tegument protein pp150 and the complex formed by pUL47/pUL48 proteins are involved in the transport of viral capsid at the nuclear membrane (Bechtel & Shenk, 2002); however, their definite cellular binding partner(s) has not been identified yet. A recent study on HSV-1 reported that plus/minus directed microtubule motors bind to viral capsids using different tegument proteins, including also the HCMV pUL48 ortholog pUL36 (Radtke et al., 2010). Furthermore, the disruption of cellular microtubule network caused by the drug nocodazole prevents viral IE gene expression (Ogawa-Goto et al., 2003), thus highlighting the potential of this process as a target of novel antiviral drugs. Once the viral capsids reach the nuclear membrane, they are supposed to dock at the nuclear pore complex and then to release the viral genome into the nucleus. Again, the events and the players involved in these processes are still poorly characterized. For HSV-1, two capsid-associated tegument proteins, i.e., pUL25 and pUL36, were recently shown to play a role in facilitating the nuclear translocation of viral genome. In fact, pUL25 was found to interact with two cellular nucleoporins (Pasdeloup et al., 2009); in addition, proteolytic cleavage of pUL36 at the nuclear membrane was shown to be required for efficient release of viral DNA into the nucleus (Jovasevic et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The nuclear translocation of HCMV genome is not sufficient to induce the onset of lytic replication. In fact, there is compelling experimental evidence that the tegument protein pp71/UL82 has to localize into the nucleus of HCMV-infected cells to efficiently promote viral IE gene expression (Penkert & Kalejta, 2010). After entry into the nucleus, HCMV genome is \u201cattacked\u201d by components of an intrinsic cellular antiviral defense in order to reach viral genome silencing (Tavalai & Stamminger, 2008). The effectors of this antiviral defense are primarily chromatin remodeling enzymes (Woodhall et al., 2006, Cuevas-Bennett and Shenk, 2008, Nitzsche et al., 2008) and proteins generally found as constituents of Nuclear Bodies. Thanks to the activities of these proteins, and in particular to the activity of the transcriptional corepressor Daxx, immediately after entry the incoming HCMV genome could be assimilated to transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. However, the pp71 protein counteracts Daxx-mediated Major Immediate-Early Promoter (MIEP) repression first by displacing Daxx from its corepressor ATRX (Lukashchuk et al., 2008), by inducing its SUMOylation (Hwang & Kalejta, 2009), and eventually by targeting it to proteasomal degradation via an ubiquitin-independent pathway (Hwang & Kalejta, 2007). By these mechanisms, pp71 is therefore able to efficiently contrast the inhibition of IE gene expression mediated by Daxx. The pp71 protein also targets Rb family members to degradation, thus contributing to G0/G1 progression of virus-infected cells (Kalejta & Shenk, 2003).",

It consists of the MIE locus UL122\u2013123, which encodes the IE1-72 and IE2-86 proteins. Their expression is regulated by an upstream rightward located, enhancer-containing promoter, i.e., the MIEP. Relative to the transcription start site at nucleotide +1, the MIEP spans bases up to \u221239, while the enhancer extends up to base \u2212750. The enhancer is in turn divided into two portions: the proximal enhancer (from base \u221239 to base \u2212300) and the distal enhancer (from base \u2212300 to base \u2212550). In addition, a unique region is located between bases \u2212350 and \u2212750. The two components of MIE enhancer are not equivalent; in fact, the deletion of the distal portion of the enhancer is tolerated at high MOI and recombinant viruses lacking of this region still replicate, albeit slowly, showing a small-plaque phenotype (Meier and Pruessner, 2000, Meier et al., 2002). In contrast, the deletion of the proximal enhancer results in non-viable viruses, indicating that this region is absolutely required for virus replication (Isomura et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Like eukaryotic enhancers, the MIE enhancer of HCMV contains a high number of repeated, cis-acting binding sites for cellular transcription factors (TFs) that, once bound, attract RNA polymerase II and other components of the basal transcription machinery to permit MIE gene expression. The number and the distribution of these binding sites vary in the CMVs, thus reflecting a possible example of adaptation throughout co-evolution with different hosts to reach the most efficient viral replication (for a review see Stinski & Isomura, 2008). In keeping with this hypothesis, the enhancers of murine CMV and HCMV are not interchangeable (Isomura & Stinski, 2003). The HCMV MIE enhancer contains TF binding sites in common with other CMVs, e.g., sites for NF-\u043aB, CREB/ATF, AP-1, and Sp1 (Hunninghake et al., 1989, Liu and Stinski, 1992, Keller et al., 2003), as well binding sites unique for HCMV, e.g., sites for retinoic acid receptor, Elk-1, Serum Response Factor, CRE-Binding Protein, and \u03b3-interferon-activated sites (Angulo and Ghazal, 1995, Netterwald et al., 2005). However, the minimal enhancer sequence for efficient MIE gene expression has been identified in two Sp1/Sp3 binding sites (GC boxes) located at bases \u221255 and \u221275, based on the observation that mutations of these sites impair MIE gene transcription (Isomura et al., 2005). The MIE enhancer of HCMV is flanked by two divergent viral promoters, i.e., the MIEP (discussed below) and the UL127 gene promoter. The unique region of MIEP acts like an insulator element since it contains binding sites for cellular repressors (Chao et al., 2004, Lashmit et al., 2004) and provides negative regulation of UL127 promoter, thus blocking the influence of MIE enhancer on transcription from UL127. Also the MIE enhancer is subjected to negative regulation leading to repression of MIE gene expression, which could be an option from a therapeutical point of view. In fact, the MIE region of HCMV has a key role in virus reactivation from latency; of note is the fact that IE proteins are not expressed in non-permissive cells and during latency, reflecting their role in acute infection as well as in reactivation.",

The TATA box serves as a recognition site for the basal transcription machinery assembly, since basal TFs are recruited at the promoter by TATA box-binding protein (TBP), which interacts with the other TFs and ultimately promotes the binding of RNA polymerase II to MIEP. HCMV requires both promoter and enhancer to efficiently induce MIE gene transcription; an enhancerless recombinant HCMV is in fact not able to replicate (Isomura et al., 2004).

            "text": "The pivotal role played by MIEP functions and MIE gene expression for the progression of productive infection makes them attractive targets for novel antiviral strategies. A proof-of-principle for the feasibility of this approach is provided by the sole approved anti-HCMV drug that blocks MIE gene expression, i.e., fomivirsen. Fomivirsen (ISIS 2922; Fig. 1), marketed as Vitravene\u00ae (Novartis Ophtalmics), is an antisense ODN composed of 21 phosphorothioate-linked nucleotides (5\u2032-GCGTTTGCTCTTCTTCTTGCG-3\u2032), which was identified in a screening of oligonucleotides complementary to the mRNA of HCMV MIE transcriptional unit (Azad et al., 1993). This ODN is able to hybridize with IE2 mRNA, thus blocking the expression of the IE2-86 protein. This was initially supposed to be the unique mechanism of antiviral action of fomivirsen, however other (sequence-unrelated) effects on the expression of other viral genes, e.g., UL123, have been reported (Azad et al., 1993). Furthermore, in a fomivirsen-resistant virus no mutation in the IE2 gene region complementary to fomivirsen was detected (Mulamba et al., 1998). Therefore, beside IE2-86 expression, other viral functions might be affected by this antiviral compound, such as adsorption and entry, targets of other antiviral ODNs (Shogan et al., 2006, Luganini et al., 2008a). Fomivirsen/Vitravene\u00ae has been approved by Food and Drug Administration only for ophtalmic use and in U.S. is recommended for the treatment of HCMV-induced retinitis in AIDS patients. It has been withdrawn from the European market for commercial reasons; however, it remains still available for European patients when needed. Fomivirsen/Vitravene\u00ae is typically administered as an intravitreal injection of 330 \u03bcg/0.5 ml in two doses every two weeks, but it is not recommended for patients who have been treated with CDV, because this may increase one of fomivirsen typical side effects, i.e., eye inflammation. In addition, other ocular or systemic side-effects have been reported for fomivirsen, which restrict its use only to topical administration. In general, antisense ODNs and small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) represent a promising class of antiviral agents; however, they suffer from several drawbacks, such as need of repeated administration, poor bioavailability, low stability in fluids, and inefficient uptake, thus limiting their clinical applications (for a review see Fattal & Bochot, 2008). For these reasons, in the past years many efforts have been spent to extend the use of antisense ODNs and siRNAs as systemic drugs and to improve their pharmacokinetics and cell uptake by exploiting nanoparticulate delivery systems. These approaches include association with cationic polymers and polymeric nanocapsules (Fattal and Bochot, 2008, de Martimprey et al., 2009). As an example of successful application of these strategies, it was reported that the use of albumin nanoparticles for the combined delivery of GCV and a phosphodiester analog of fomivirsen significatly improved the effectiveness of these drugs (Irache et al., 2005).",

            "text": "In addition to fomivirsen, a series of other compounds have been reported to exert a repressive effect on HCMV MIEP activation or to inhibit MIE gene expression (Table 3\n); however, for many of these the exact mechanism of action remains yet to be elucidated. For example, it is known that trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), triggers MIEP reactivation (Ferguson et al., 2011); therefore, one may speculate that inhibitors of histone acetylases or histone methyltransferases could exert anti-HCMV activity by silencing the MIEP. Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of cellular signaling pathways important for MIEP activation results in impairment of virus replication (Johnson et al., 2001). In this context, there is compelling evidence that drugs able to perturb the cellular PI3K/Akt signaling pathway or NF-\u03baB activation have also a significant impact on MIEP activation. The PI3K protein belongs to the class of cellular tyrosine kinases and is activated by different mitogenic stimuli. Its activation triggers a phosphorylation cascade together with other cellular kinases, including Akt. Infection with HCMV strongly up-regulates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Johnson et al., 2001); PI3K-dependent activation of Akt and p70S6K leads eventually to NF-\u03baB activation, a transcription factor important for inducing MIE gene expression. In line with this, the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin (Fig. 6\n) were reported to inhibit both MIE gene expression and viral DNA synthesis by preventing NF-\u03baB activation and, possibly, the phosphorylation of other cellular proteins required for efficient virus replication. Also other inhibitors of kinases, acting both upstream and downstream PI3K in cell signaling, were reported to have anti-HCMV activity. For example, worthy of note is artesunate (Fig. 6). This compound was initially identified as an anti-malaria agent and is currently used for treatment of Plasmodium spp. infections (Rosenthal, 2008). Later, artesunate was discovered to inhibit HCMV-induced transactivation activities of both NF-\u03baB and Sp1, necessary for the activation of MIEP (Efferth et al., 2002). Studies to elucidate the mechanism of the anti-HCMV activity of artesunate indicated that it blocks the activation of two effectors of PI3K pathway, i.e., Akt and p70S6K. Further work is needed to fully understand the antiviral mechanism of this drug, which could represent an alternative option for treatment of HCMV infections. In fact, artesunate has shown a good bioavailability profile and lack of significant toxicity in clinical anti-malaria studies (Hien et al., 1992a, Hien et al., 1992b, Nosten, 1994).",

It inhibits MIEP activity and MIE gene expression in a panel of different cell lines, but the exact mechanism of the anti-HCMV activity of Sorafenib has not yet been established. Nevertheless, there are indications suggesting that the inhibition of the cellular kinase Raf could be involved, although a role for Raf in MIE gene expression has not been described previously (Michaelis et al., 2011). Raf is a cell signaling effector acting before the mitogen-activated kinases MEK and ERK/MAPK, but it has also been involved in the NF-\u03baB activation pathway (Wellbrock et al., 2004). Further studies will be necessary to establish whether Sorafenib might represent a novel anti-HCMV drug, in particular for cancer patients who are at risk of HCMV reactivation as prospected in (Michaelis et al., 2011).",

This is the case of geldanamycin (Fig. 6), which is an Hsp90 inhibitor that interferes with HCMV replication (Basha et al., 2005). The inhibition of molecular chaperone Hsp90 leads to the inactivation of its client proteins, including Akt and other kinases involved in PI3K signaling. Another example is represented by proteasome inhibitors, in particular MG132 (Fig. 6), which have shown the ability to block HCMV replication (Prosch et al., 2003). The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is one of the most important activators of MIEP and it is found in an inactive cytoplasmatic complex with its repressor I\u03baB. The activation of diverse kinases in response to extracellular stimuli leads to phosphorylation of the latter and to its proteasomal degradation via an ubiquitin-dependent pathway, resulting in the activation of NF-\u03baB. Therefore, the anti-HCMV activity reported for MG132 might be mainly due to the cytosolic accumulation of I\u03baB caused by lack of proteasomal degradation. The failed release of NF-\u03baB blocks its nuclear translocation and abrogates IE gene expression. Proteasome inhibitors, however, have demonstrated also other inhibitory effects on HCMV processes (Kaspari et al., 2008).",

Furthermore, although most of the compounds reported in Table 3 can inhibit HCMV replication at concentrations that are clinically relevant, none of them has a selectivity index comparable to that of GCV. Perturbing cellular pathways and/or functions might be not a feasible strategy, since nonspecific adverse effects cannot be excluded. Therefore, accurate studies are needed to establish whether these inhibitors could be useful in clinical anti-HCMV settings.",

            "text": "The ability of IE2-86 to repress its own promoter is essential for virus replication. IE2-86 forms homodimers and binds directly to a DNA sequence in the MIEP, i.e. crs, located between the TATA box and the transcription start site. This regulatory element consists of a 14-bp sequence of a GC dinucleotide flanked by two A/T rich regions (Waheed et al., 1998). The binding of IE2-86 to crs physically blocks the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and thus prevents the assembly of the pre-initiation complex and subsequent MIE gene expression. Mutations in both crs and IE2-86 able to impair the DNA\u2013protein interaction have a lethal effect in virus replication (Petrik et al., 2007, Isomura et al., 2008). However, it seems that the crs might have a dual role during HCMV replication. In fact, it has been reported that in the first phases of HCMV replication an unknown cellular protein of about 150 kDa interacts with crs, and that this interaction results in increase of MIE gene expression (Isomura et al., 2008). Then, with the progression of virus replication, IE2-86 is abundantly expressed and becomes able to compete with this cellular protein for crs binding, thus exerting a repressive effect on its own promoter. Furthermore, IE2-86 is able to interact with repressive chromatin remodelling enzymes such as HDAC-1 and HDAC-2 (Reeves et al., 2006, Park et al., 2007). The recruitment of these proteins by IE2-86 causes the deacetylation of histones at MIEP and modifications in the chromatin status of the promoter leading to silencing of MIE genes.",

            "text": "One of the most striking features of IE2-86 is its ability to function both as a transactivator of gene expression and as a repressor. IE2-86 is the major transactivator of viral E genes and the IE1-72 protein enhances this activity (Nevels et al., 2004). The transactivation properties of IE2-86 mainly rely on protein\u2013protein interactions. In fact, IE2-86 interacts with several components of the basal transcription machinery, including TBP, TFIIB, and TAFII130-TAF4 (Caswell et al., 1993), showing by itself TAF-like functions (Lukac et al., 1994, Lukac et al., 1997). Furthermore, both IE2-86 and IE1-72 attract histone acetylases to permit the activation of viral E promoters (Bryant et al., 2000, Nevels et al., 2004). However, there are also evidences of a direct binding of IE2-86 to DNA sequences in E promoters required for efficient promoter activation (Schwartz et al., 1994, Scully et al., 1995). The transactivating functions of IE2-86 are essential for the progression of HCMV lytic replication cycle, since point mutations that affect the ability of IE2-86 either to bind E promoters (Petrik et al., 2007) or to interact with basal transcription factors (Harris et al., 2010) abrogate HCMV replication. Furthermore, although RNA polymerase II and TBP are recruited at viral E promoters in the absence of IE2-86, the latter remains essential to achieve E genes expression (Petrik et al., 2007). IE2-86 also acts as a repressor of key cellular regulators, e.g., the tumor suppressor Rb (Hagemeier et al., 1994). Through the interaction with Rb, IE2-86 induces the activation of E2F-responsive genes whose products are responsible of G1/S progression in HCMV-infected cells, thus providing a way to bypass the cellular quiescence.",

            "text": "During the past years, many efforts have been aimed at identifying whether a transactivation domain in IE2-86 could be separated from a domain responsible of autoregulation. A definitive answer has to be found yet. A core domain was initially identified in IE2-86C-terminus from amino acid 450 to 452 that was apparently required for all functions (Asmar et al., 2004). A more recent study, which characterized the effects of two double mutations in IE2-86, i.e., P535A/Y537A and H446A/H452A, shed further light on this aspect (Petrik et al., 2007). In fact, the authors showed that a P535A/Y537A mutant is still able to autoregulate the MIEP even though it is not competent for transactivation, suggesting that IE2-86 likely uses two independent mechanisms for crs binding and for activation of viral E promoters. Very recently, an analysis of the effects of point mutations in IE2-86 between amino acids 435 and 545 was performed to assess the impact of single aa changes on IE2-86 transactivating activity both in vitro and in the context of viral replication (Harris et al., 2010). This study evidenced that residue Y544 is essential for UL54 promoter activation while P535 is not; in contrast, mutation of either P535 or Y544 inhibits UL112\u2013113 promoter transactivation. Thus, the possibility that IE2-86 might use distinct mechanisms to activate different responsive promoters was suggested. Nevertheless, the identification of IE2-86 residues essential for autoregulatory/transactivating functions merits further investigation, because the comprehension at a molecular level of the mechanism(s) of action of this protein could provide a route for developing IE2-86 inhibitors.",

            "text": "Recently, a class of compounds, namely 6-aminoquinolones, has emerged as novel antiviral compounds that act by blocking viral transactivating functions (Parolin et al., 2003). More recently, a 6-aminoquinolone\u2014termed WC5 (Fig. 6)\u2014that potently and selectively inhibits HCMV replication (EC50: 0.9 \u03bcM) was identified (Mercorelli et al., 2009). A remarkable feature of WC5 is that it specifically inhibits HCMV replication, exhibiting a selectivity index (~500) more favorable than that of GCV, while it has no significant activity against other human herpesviruses (Mercorelli et al., 2009). Importantly, WC5 was also potently active against clinical strains of HCMV recovered from infected patients, as well as against virus strains resistant to drugs currently used for anti-HCMV therapy, e.g., GCV, FOS, and CDV. For these reasons, WC5 was considered as a promising lead for the development of novel anti-HCMV drugs. Further studies performed to elucidate the mode of action of WC5 demonstrated that it acts by a mechanism different from all of the licensed anti-HCMV drugs (Loregian et al., 2010). In fact, WC5 does not inhibit either HCMV DNA polymerase activity or IE gene expression, but interferes with the transactivation activity of IE2-86 protein. By exploiting a cell-based assay developed to identify IE2-86 inhibitors (Luganini et al., 2008b), it was demonstrated that WC5 is able to inhibit the IE2-86-mediated transactivation of viral E genes, thus blocking E and L gene expression (Loregian et al., 2010). Importantly, WC5 acts synergistically with GCV against HCMV replication, while the cytotoxic effect of the two compounds in combination is additive (Loregian et al., 2010). These findings open the possibility of a combination therapy with similar synergistic effects in vivo that could provide a means to treat HCMV infection while reducing drug toxicity and the outcome of drug-resistant mutants.",

Deeper investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of IE2-86 transactivating activity at molecular level and to verify whether in the antiviral activity of WC5 other functions/activities of IE2-86 might be involved, whose inhibition could contribute to the block of virus replication in WC5-treated cells.",

Thus, there is strong hope that at least a few of the compounds described here, or their derivatives, will reach the marketplace and help to improve the treatment options for this area of high unmet medical need. To do this, they should circumvent the toxicity, bioavailability, resistance, and efficacy issues associated with the current anti-HCMV drugs. Moreover, the availability of compounds targeting other viral events beside genome replication could allow the design of more active therapeutic protocols based on the combined use of multiple anti-HCMV drugs, like the highly active antiretroviral therapy that has changed the lives of HIV-infected patients. Research efforts to dissect further the molecular interactions and mechanisms involved in the first events of HCMV life cycle are clearly necessary to identify other novel drug targets and to develop new inhibitors against these targets.",

HCMV entry in permissive host cell (1) occurs either via fusion with the plasma membrane (in fibroblasts) or via receptor-mediated endocytosis (in epithelial and endothelial cells). Once in the cytoplasm, viral tegument disassembly occurs (2). Some viral tegument proteins, like pUL47/pUL48 and maybe ppUL32, are engaged in the transport of virus capsids through the cytoplasm and in intranuclear translocation of viral genome via nuclear pores (3); other tegument proteins, such as pp71, are able to localize autonomously into the nucleus. After intranuclear delivery, HCMV genome quickly becomes associated with Nuclear Bodies (NBs) components, in particular Daxx, and with chromatin remodeling enzymes (ChREs) (4) in a process that would lead to the Major Immediate-Early Promoter (MIEP) silencing without the counteracting effect of pp71. The pp71 protein, in fact, causes the degradation of Daxx and blocks MIEP silencing, thus activating MIE gene expression (5). After expression of MIE genes (6), IE2-86 acts as a repressor of its own promoter in concert with histone deacetylases (HDACs) by binding to crs (7). Furthermore, it acts as a transactivator of viral and cellular promoters to induce viral early (E) gene expression (8) and modulate the cell-cycle progression of infected cell (9).
