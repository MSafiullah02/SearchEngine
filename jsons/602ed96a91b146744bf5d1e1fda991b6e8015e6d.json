Exams are acquired with automated tube current and tube voltage modulation systems.

As the authors stated, the presence of two radiology technologists (RTs) represents the best solution for the CT scanning of COVID-19 patients: one RT with PPE sets up the patient positioning on the scanner table, whereas a second one, without PPE, operates the machine console. In the case of non-enhanced CT, a RT alone, wearing PPE, comes into contact with the patient; if patients do not cooperate, the RT will make use of the support of the healthcare assistant (HA) carrying the patient, already protected with PPE. In the case of contrast-enhanced CT, the medical radiologist wears PPE for direct assistance to the patient and to inject the contrast medium.",

In this time, a specifically trained HA, protected with PPE, removes the disposable sheet and cleans contact surfaces with a cloth soaked with alcohol-based disinfectants. The dedicated HA staff, on duty throughout the day, is also committed to assisting in dressing healthcare workers with PPE.",
