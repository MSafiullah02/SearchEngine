            "text": "The clinical outlook for patients with HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Type 1) has improved dramatically as an increasingly effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) options have become readily available (Maschke et al. 2000; Sacktor et al. 2002; Gray et al. 2003; McArthur et al. 2003). Paradoxically, however, increased survival rates resulting from therapy usage have resulted in an undesirable increase in the prevalence of minor neurocognitive impairment collectively referred to as NeuroHIV. Complications of the central nervous system (CNS) represent a substantial health burden in HIV-1 infected individuals because of the privileged immune status of the brain coupled with the limited accessibility of some ART regimens to penetrate the CNS (Ellis et al. 2007). Despite ART-mediated near complete suppression of virus replication, NeuroHIV still exists in almost 40% of infected patients (Simioni et al. 2010). Viral protein transactivator of transcription (Tat) that was first identified as a neurotoxin by Nath et al. (Nath et al. 1996) has been shown to exert diverse cytotoxic effects including, but not limited to, eliciting of neuroexcitatory responses (Haughey et al. 1999; Nath et al. 2000; Buscemi et al. 2007; Hui et al. 2012a, b) as well as induction of dendritic/synaptic degeneration (Kim et al. 2008; Fitting et al. 2010; Mocchetti et al. 2012). Even in virally suppressed individuals that are on cART, mounting evidence implicates the presence of Tat in the lymph nodes and CNS compartments (Cowley et al. 2011). Viral Tat through its ability to exert excitotoxicity and inflammation is a contributor of CNS dysfunction (Gabuzda et al. 1986) by exerting toxicity in most cell types of the CNS including, but not limited to, the glia and the pyramidal hippocampal and cortical neurons (Aksenov et al. 2006). Studies have also demonstrated that exogenous Tat injections in the rodent brain cause a multitude of neuropathological (Bansal et al. 2000) and behavioral abnormalities mimicking aspects of NeuroHIV (Rappaport et al. 1999; Bruce-Keller et al. 2003).",

Release kinetics of EVs, including their number, size distribution as well as their cargo, has been reported to be altered during various pathologies (Piccin et al. 2007; Shi et al. 2014) including cancer (Rabinowits et al. 2009; Taylor and Gercel-Taylor 2011), neurological diseases (Gupta and Pulliam 2014) and viral infections (Bhattarai et al. 2013; Narayanan et al. 2013). Elegant studies have also demonstrated that HIV-infected cells release EVs containing HIV proteins (Gag and Nef) and RNA (the trans-activation response element [TAR]) (Booth et al. 2006; Campbell et al. 2008; Shelton et al. 2012; Narayanan et al. 2013; Rahimian and He 2016b; Sami Saribas et al. 2017) and that these viral components can be transferred to neighboring/distant cells leading to functional impairment of the recipient cells. Moreover, despite cART treatment, EVs from HIV-1-infected primary cells and patient biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid continue to express viral products (DeMarino et al. 2018), thereby underpinning the role of EVs in neurocognitive and immunological dysfunction in the era of cART.",

Using bioinformatics and cellular analyses EV-miR-7 was found to target neuronal NLGN2. Interestingly, treatment of neuronal cells with the neurotropic factor platelet-derived growth factor-CC (PDGF-CC) was found to restore EV-miR-7-mediated synaptic injury. These findings thus suggest that PDGF-CC treatment could be considered as a neuroprotective strategy against Tat-EV-mediated alterations of synaptic densities.",

MiR-7 has been shown to play an important role in mediating neuronal homeostasis (Choi et al. 2015; Kleaveland et al. 2018). Based on the fact that there is disruption of neuronal plasticity in the brains of SIV-infected rhesus macaques and HIV-infected humans, we thus sought to assess the expression of miR-7 in the brain regions (BG and frontal cortices-FC) of SIV+/HIV+ subjects by qPCR. As shown in Figs. 1b and c, there was upregulated expression of miR-7 in the BG and FC of SIV+/HIV+ subjects compared with the uninfected controls. Upregulation of miR-7 in the BG of SIV-infected RMs was also validated by in situ hybridization (ISH), wherein we found its expression primarily in the GFAP positive astrocytes (Fig. 1d), compared with the uninfected controls. Additionally, as expected, there was also increased expression of GFAP in astrocytes in the brains of SIV-infected macaques compared with those from uninfected controls (Witwer et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2014).",

            "text": "HIV-1 protein Tat has been previously reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) (Johnson et al., 2013; Steiner et al., 2015). Action of Tat involves its ability to cause both excitotoxicity & neuroinflammation in various CNS cells including the astrocytes (Aksenov et al. 2006), ultimately resulting in CNS dysfunction (Gabuzda et al. 1986). We thus sought to examine whether exposure of human primary astrocytes to HIV-1 Tat (as a surrogate of HIV-1 infection) could lead to upregulation of miR-7. As shown in Fig. 2a, HIV Tat (100 ng/ml) significantly upregulated the expression of miR-7 in human primary astrocytes. Of note, the upregulation (~3 fold) of miR-7 by Tat protein in vitro is much lower than that observed in brain tissues (~6 fold). This could be due to the addictive effect of Tat and Tat-ADEVs in vivo &/or due to cooperative changes in various CNS cells in vivo. Next, we sought to examine whether the Tat-stimulated astrocytes also upregulated the expression of miR-7 in EVs. To this end, we first isolated EVs from the conditioned media of human astrocyte A172 cells as well as rat and human primary astrocytes using the differential ultracentrifugation procedure previously reported by us (Yang et al. 2018; Hu et al. 2012, 2013), followed by characterization of ADEVs, using standard methodologies including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), western blotting for exosomal markers and nanosight analyses. As shown in Fig. 2b, TEM images showed spherical-shaped EVs ranging in size from 40 to 100 nm in diameter. Additionally, immunoblotting of the ADEV lysates also revealed the presence of exosomal markers CD63 and Tsg101 (Fig. 2c). ADEVs were also validated by ZetaView revealing a reasonable yield of EVs of the expected size [~100 nm; Fig. 2d]. In addition, we also sought to assess the expression of miR-7 in both control and HIV-1 Tat ADEVs by qPCR. Intriguingly, elevated miR-7 expression was also detected in ADEVs purified from conditioned media of astrocytes exposed to Tat protein (Fig. 2e). The next step was to examine whether the miR-7 released in the EVs from Tat-stimulated astrocytes could actually be taken up by primary rat hippocampal neurons. For this EVs isolated from the conditioned media of control astrocytes were first loaded with Texas Red RNA followed by exposure of primary rat hippocampal neurons (PRHNs) to labeled EVs. As shown in Fig. 2f, Texas Red labeling was detectable in neurons exposed to labeled ADEVs, thereby suggesting the uptake of ADEVs by neurons. In keeping with this data, PRHNs exposed to Tat-ADEVs isolated from rat primary astrocytes also demonstrated increased expression of cellular miR-7 compared with the neurons exposed to control-ADEVs or neurons not exposed to EVs (Fig. 2g).",

The next step, therefore, was to determine whether the transferred miR-7, once inside the neurons, could directly bind to the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of the target mRNA and inhibit its translation. For this HEK293 cells were transfected with an NLGN2\u20133\u2032UTR luciferase reporter construct, wherein luciferase expression was regulated by the NLGN2 3\u2032UTR, a miR-7 potential binding element (Fig. 3a). We next sought to determine whether overexpressing miR-7 could downregulate luciferase activity in cells transdfected with the NLGN2\u20133\u2019UTR-luciferase constructs. For this, we first determined the transfection efficiency of HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3b and c, transfection of miR-7 resulted in >1000- fold increase in miR-7 without affecting cell viability. Co-transfection of HEK293 cells with both miR-7 and NLGN2\u20133\u2019UTR-luciferase constructs resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity, thereby suggesting preferential binding of miR-7 with the 3\u2032UTR of NLGN2. As a negative control, cells were also co-transfected with a construct containing mutations in the miR-7-binding region of the NLGN2 3\u2032UTR, and as expected, in cells transfected with the NLGN2 3\u2032UTR mutant, miR-7 failed to downregulate luciferase activity (Fig. 3d). To validate the specificity of miR-7, we next exposed PRHNs to ADEVs isolated from rat primary astrocytes loaded with either control miRNA or miR-7 oligos, followed by assessing the expression of NLGN2 by western blotting. In PRHNs exposed to miR-7 loaded ADEVs, NLGN2 expression was downregulated compared with cells exposed to control ADEVs (Fig. 3e). Intriguingly, neurons exposed to HIV Tat-ADEVs (A172 astrocytes) also demonstrated significant inhibition of NLGN2 expression compared with neurons exposed to control-ADEVs (Fig. 3f).",

PRHNs (20d in vitro (DIV20) were exposed to EVs isolated from conditioned media of Tat-stimulated rat primary astrocytes for 24 h. PRHNs were then subjected to synaptic density assessment by confocal microscopy imaging for both inhibitory (GAD65) and excitatory (vGlut1) synapses by immunostaining, followed by quantification. Intriguingly, neurons exposed to Tat-ADEVs demonstrated significant synaptic injury (increased loss of both inhibitory and excitatory synapses), compared with neurons exposed to control-ADEVs (Fig. 4a and b), with no change in cell viability (Fig. 4c). Decreased expression of PSD95 in PRHNs exposed to Tat-ADEVs was further validated by western blotting (Fig. 4d). Next, to determine the role of miR-7, PRHNs were exposed to ADEVs loaded with either control miR or miR-7 oligos followed by monitoring the expression of inhibitory synapse marker by immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, neurons exposed to miR-7 loaded ADEVs demonstrated a significant reduction of inhibitory synapses compared to neurons exposed to control-ADEVs. To further confirm that NLGN2 was the critical component in the Tat-ADEV-mediated synaptic loss, PRHNs were transfected with either NLGN2 overexpression construct or a control vector, followed by exposure to either control or Tat ADEVs for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4g and h, Tat-ADEVs failed to decrease excitatory synapses in NLGN2 overexpressing neurons.",

We thus rationalized that exposure of neurons to PDGF-CC could lead to protection against ADEV-miR-7-mediated impairment of synaptic alterations. To verify this, PRHNs were pre-treated with PDGF-CC (20 ng/ml) (Han et al. 2007; Donovan et al. 2013) for 24 h followed by exposure of treated cells to ADEVs loaded with either control or miR-7 oligos. Twenty four hours later neurons were fixed and immunostained for synaptic markers followed by imaging by confocal microscopy to assess synaptic densities. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, in the presence of PDGF-CC there was restoration of EV-miR-7-mediated decrease of inhibitory synapses. To examine the functional alterations induced by Tat-ADEVs followed by rescue with PDGF-CC, we also recorded frequencies of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) as well as miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in PRHNs (DIV 19\u201321) exposed to either control-ADEVs or Tat-ADEVs or PDGF-CC or Tat-ADEVs plus PDGF-CC. As shown in Figs. 5c\u2013f there was a decrease in the frequency of both mEPSCs and mIPSCs in PRHNs treated with Tat-ADEVs. In addition, and consistent with the data shown in Fig. 5a and b, pre-treatment of PRHNs with PDGF-CC rescued the expression of both PSD95 and NLGN2 in the presence of either Tat-ADEVs (Fig. 5g and h) or ADEV-miR-7 (Fig. 5i and j).",

For example, Dickens et al. have demonstrated that ADEVs from IL-1\u03b2 stimulated astrocytes can rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the peripheral circulation and the liver, leading, in turn, to the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression via suppression of PPAR\u03b1, ultimately promoting the transmigration of leukocytes into the CNS (Dickens et al. 2017). Furthermore, ADEVs released from IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 stimulated astrocytes are found to be enriched with miRNAs, including, but not limited to, miR-125a-5p and miR-16-5p, which upon uptake by the neurons can downregulate neuronal NTKR3, ultimately resulting in reduction of dendritic growth, dendritic complexity, reduced spike rates and burst activity (Chaudhuri et al. 2018). We have previously reported that HIV-1 Tat mediates the induction and release of miR-9 in ADEVs, which upon uptake by the microglia, result in enhanced migration of these latter cells (Yang et al. 2018). Herein, we expand our findings and demonstrate that exposure of astrocytes to HIV Tat resulted in increased expression and release of several miRNAs in the EV cargo, specifically the brain-enriched miR-7, which upon uptake by the hippocampal neurons, resulted in the loss of inhibitory synapses.",

            "text": "Synapses play a critical role in establishing and maintaining neural circuits thereby permitting targeted information transfer throughout the brain. A large portfolio of synaptic adhesion/organizing proteins (SAPs) exists in the mammalian brain that are involved in synapse development and maintenance. SAPs play critical roles in cell adhesion and in organizing protein interaction networks. Members of the NLGNs family of SAPs that are present on the postsynaptic membrane are vital regulators of synaptic structure, function, and remodeling (Sudhof 2008; Li et al. 2017; Stogsdill et al. 2017) in the central neurons. SAPs maintain a tightrope balance of excitatory/inhibitory synapses in the brain (Durieux et al. 2016). Dysfunction of SAPs such as NLGNs is associated with several CNS diseases, including autism and epilepsy (Lionel et al. 2013; Nakanishi et al. 2017). While impairments in excitatory and inhibitory synapse balance are a hallmark of various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and have been implicated in CNS complications associated with HIV infection and opiate abuse (Kim et al. 2008; Fitting et al. 2013; Fitting et al. 2014; Hahn et al. 2015; Gangwar et al. 2017; Xiao et al. 2017), the role of SAPs in the context of HIV-1 infection remains elusive. Interesting emerging studies have implicated astrocytes, one of the most abundant cell types in the CNS, as regulators of NLGNs (Rudenko 2017). Previous findings by others (Rahimian and He 2016a; Dickens et al. 2017) and us (Hu et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2018) have demonstrated that EVs released from astrocytes are conduits for delivering cargo to donor cells, culminating into a broad spectrum of functional changes in the recipient cells. In the current study, we found that the expression of NLGN2 was significantly reduced in the archival brain tissues of HIV/SIV-infected subjects compared with uninfected controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat-mediated release of astrocytic EV-miR-7 downregulated neuronal NLGN2, which could be a functional link between the NLGN2 and cognitive dysfunction associated with HIV-1.",

            "text": "In the CNS, neuronal homeostasis is a delicate balance between neurotrophic vs. neurotoxic factors. Various factors such as BDNF, FGF, and GDNF have been implicated in neuronal protection against neurotoxins (Alzheimer and Werner 2002; Almeida et al. 2005; Deierborg et al. 2008; Colafrancesco and Villoslada 2011). Elegant studies have suggested downregulation of BDNF following HIV-1 infection (Bachis and Mocchetti 2005; Mocchetti et al. 2007; Nosheny et al. 2007; Avdoshina et al. 2011; Bachis et al. 2012). Findings from our lab have identified yet another factor, PDGF that plays a crucial role in reversing neuronal toxicity mediated by HIV-1 Tat and gp120 (Yao et al. 2009). We previously demonstrated that treatment of morphine-exposed neurons with PDGF-BB ameliorated morphine-mediated synaptic alterations in hippocampal neurons through inhibition of ER stress and autophagy pathways, which leads to the preservation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Cai et al. 2016). Our current data suggest that pre-treatment of Tat-ADEV-exposed neurons with PDGF-CC ameliorated Tat-ADEV-mediated synaptic loss in the hippocampal neurons. We also demonstrated that pre-treatment of PRHNs with PDGF-CC rescued downregulated expression of both PSD95 and NLGN2 in Tat-ADEVs-stimulated PRHNs, thereby underpinning the role of PDGF-CC as a neuroprotective agent for HIV-1 Tat and opiate-mediated synaptodendritic injury.",
