These generally use real-time RT-PCR amplification. For positive diagnosis of a MERS-CoV infection, amplification and detection of two different genomic targets is required, or sequencing that confirms a single target amplicon (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/). Culturing MERS-CoV from respiratory tract, blood, urine, or stool samples remains an option, although virus culturing is cumbersome, hazardous, and requires experienced staff to interpret cytopathic effects in host cells. Serological assays for detection of specific neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies are not ideal for early diagnosis and containment of the spread of the outbreaks. Therefore, RT-PCR based diagnostics still remains to be the most common detection method (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007, Chan et al., 2015).",

To detect MERS-CoV in a respiratory panel targeting Influenza A (InfA), Influenza B (InfB), Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV, we included SAMRS nucleotides (Fig. 1C) in the up-front PCR\u2019s primers (Hoshika et al., 2010). SAMRS nucleotides are designed not to interact with each other. Thus, SAMRS oligonucleotides added to a multiplexed nucleic acid targeted assays cannot create primer-dimer artifacts. Combined with AEGIS technology, SAMRS gives cleaner and more robust responses in assays (Yang et al., 2013, Glushakova et al., 2015a, Glushakova et al., 2015b). Here, the combination of three innovations allowed us to successfully detect 50 viral RNA copies of MERS-CoV in authentic samples obtained from NIAID in Frederick, MD.",

The \u201cantisense\u201d amplicon served as a negative control. As seen in Fig. 3B and D, both beacons successfully detect \u201csense\u201d amplicons in 1-plexed, 2-plexed and 6-plexed assays.",

It is also notable that total fluorescence intensity was higher by 1.6-fold when the MERS-CoV amplicon was used as a target rather than a synthetic RNA simulant. This showed that in addition to being complementary to the beacon loop, the amplicon from the MERS-CoV genome had an additional nucleotide complementary to the first (standard) nucleotide in the stem (Figs. 2 D and 3 E).

Thermal profiles were recorded after separately incubating these with both standard and AEGIS MBs and camera images are also taken at room temperature for visualization. For standard MB, incubation with 2-fold excess of the 6mer failed to open the beacon, while 8mer DNA target exhibited slight increase in fluorescence. This was consistent with the design strategy that intramolecular binding constant between the stem sequences is far greater than the intermolecular interaction between one arm of the stem and short DNA targets (6mer or 8mer). On the other hand, in the presence of the 10mer and 12mer targets, stem and part of the loop of the MB hybridized to the target, disrupted the hairpin structure, and increased the background fluorescence by 24% and 62%, respectively (Fig. 4\nA). In contrast, AEGIS-containing MB was not opened by any of the stem targets tested except with the 12mer target where only slight increase in fluorescence is observed (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that AEGIS-modified molecular beacons are superior to standard beacons in terms of resistance to stem invasion and overall NESA efficiency.",
