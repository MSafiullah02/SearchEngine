Patients were assessed clinically and with chest radiography at recruitment to ensure the absence of other significant respiratory disease. Patients were observed for this study from April 2001 to July 2002. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the East London and City Health Authority Research Ethics committee; all patients gave written informed consent.

However, when they perceived an increase over their normal, stable condition in symptoms (major and minor, see below), they noted the corresponding symptom letter on their diary card. Therefore, the patients recorded symptom letters if a symptom was perceived as worse, eg, dyspnea, or of new onset, eg, a sore throat (as the latter is not usually present).",

The analysis of group data was initially adjusted for repeated measures by selecting the first exacerbation sampled per patient (n = 39) to assess the changes in measured indexes from baseline to exacerbation. These observed changes were comparable to the larger data set of 56 exacerbations (in 39 patients), which was therefore used to compare individual exacerbation characteristics and etiologies, as in previous studies.5 Multivariate analysis was performed using a multiple linear regression analysis.

These findings suggest that changes in bacterial load may play a role in the heightened levels of airway inflammation characteristic of exacerbations. However, evidence for an association between changes in bacterial load and indexes of exacerbation severity does not prove causality; it is possible that changes in airway bacterial load may simply be a secondary phenomenon to other causes of inflammation. Indeed, the findings of this study show that the key changes in symptoms and lung function at exacerbation were observed when the synergistic effects of viral and bacterial infection were found. In vitro and intervention studies are required to differentiate the exact contribution of a particular pathogen or pathogens to the inflammatory and pathophysiologic changes at exacerbation.",

These findings compliment previous work19 of the role that strain changes of particular bacterial species play in the etiology of exacerbations. This has identified the role that a new antigenic stimulus to the airway immune system plays in the pathogenesis of an exacerbation. It is feasible that acquisition of a new bacterial strain or type may not only provide a direct antigenic stimulus but also overcome the established host/pathogen balance allowing bacterial proliferation, and thus a further inflammatory stimulus due to greater bacterial numbers. To date, studies to determine the possible interactions between viral infection and bacterial strain changes have not been performed; these may provide information on the complex mechanisms that result in triggering exacerbations.",

In our cohort of influenza-vaccinated patients, we have previously demonstrated that HRV is the most commonly isolated virus at exacerbation.5 Rhinovirus can be isolated from lower airway samples6 and is associated with greater levels of inflammation than nonviral infections.6 Similarly, we have shown that colds, a marker of putative viral infections,6 are associated with more severe exacerbations. In this study, systemic inflammation (serum IL-6), exacerbation symptoms, and lung function changes were all more severe when evidence for both bacterial and viral infection was present. It is possible that this effect may have been due to the separate additional inflammatory stimuli of two separate pathogens in the airway; however, this explanation is not supported by the multivariate analysis that indicated a synergistic effect on lung function in addition to the individual effects of each pathogen type. Furthermore, these exacerbations were associated with higher bacterial loads than when both pathogens were not present, which may suggest a synergistic interactive effect of viral infection which allows greater proliferation of airway bacteria. Viral infection therefore may impact on exacerbation severity indirectly by increasing bacterial load in addition to the direct effects of viral infection itself, eg, heightened inflammation or airway hyperresponsiveness, independent of other pathogens. While HRV is the most common virus identified at exacerbation5 and hence the target of investigation in this study, a number of other respiratory viruses have been identified in the airway during these events, for example coronavirus.5\n7 The role of these other viral pathogens and atypical bacteria at exacerbation remains uncertain24\n25 and requires investigation.",

The role of bacterial infection and therefore potential bacterial-viral interaction is likely to vary with disease severity and therefore prevalence of bacterial colonization.10\n18 Indeed, we have shown that the degree of airway and systemic inflammatory response at exacerbation was related to baseline disease severity. This suggests that the severity of inflammatory response may progress with disease severity, which is in agreement with the findings of a longitudinal analysis31 of exacerbations. Further studies are required to determine if these findings can be extrapolated to COPD patients with milder disease. Indeed, the observed heterogeneity of exacerbations is likely to be further modulated by the relative frequency of particular pathogens and hence may show seasonality; this may explain differences in associated cytokine responses found in studies2 of comparable sample size. Similarly, differences in the technique of sampling, spontaneous or induced sputum, may affect the observed results. However, we have previously demonstrated the two techniques are comparable in assessing lower airway inflammation.13 Therapy must also be considered important when considering factors modulating inflammatory responses. The patients sampled for this study were all receiving inhaled steroids both at baseline and when sampled at exacerbation. It is possible that the inflammatory responses observed at exacerbation were modified by effects of this treatment.32 A statistical analysis of this effect was not feasible due to the ubiquity of inhaled steroid use in this patient group. Therefore, the modulating influences on the nature of exacerbations are numerous. It is probable that any individual factor plays a contributing rather than a definitive role in determining the nature and severity of a particular exacerbation, and furthermore that potential interactions between these factors further modulate the characteristics of these events.",
