However, there are some difficulties in understanding the functions of these unknown proteins due to very poor sequence homology with proteins available in the Protein Data Bank.",

The proteins with a sufficiently high 3D score were used as templates to construct 3D models of ORF3 using the MODELLER program [4]. The quality of 3D models was evaluated by ProQ program [5] and the best model was used for further analyses. Specifically, in order to get possible information about the function of ORF3, VAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vastsearch.html), DALI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/) and CE [6] programs were employed to search the structure neighbors of ORF3 protein. The structural comparison was performed by LGA [7]. Finally, NCI program [8] was used to identify non-canonical interactions in protein structures. The visualization of 3D structure was generated by PROTEINEXPLORER (http://www.proteinexplorer.org).",

Using 1LVL, 3GRS and 1GES_A as templates the corresponding 3D models for ORF3 were generated and the quality of protein model was evaluated by the ProQ program with two measurements. The results are listed below: 1LVL (ProQ-LG=2.826, ProQ-MX=0.249), 3GRS (ProQ-LG=1.498, ProQ-MX=0.146), 1GES (ProQ-LG=1.601, ProQ-MX=0.14). This means all 3D models of ORF3 based on above templates are \u2018correct model\u2019, 1LVL is almost \u2018good model\u2019 (the cutoff value of two protein quality measurements is: ProQ-LG>1.5 or ProQ-MX>0.1 for correct model, and ProQ-LG>3 or ProQ-MX>0.5 for good model). So we take the 3D model built on template 1LVL as the 3D model of ORF3. The alignment between ORF3 and 1LVL and secondary structure are shown in Table 1\n. Fig. 1\nshows the 3D model of ORF3 built on template 1LVL, which consists of 5 \u03b1 helices and 6 \u03b2 sheets. Three trans-membrane regions (34\u201356, 77\u201399, and 103\u2013125) predicted by Marra et al. [1] correspond to three helices regions in the alignment: 43\u201358, 71\u201398, and 103\u2013129. The additional two helices regions are also existed in the structure: 3\u201312 and 138\u2013147.",

The above three templates (1LVL, 3GRS and 1GES), which belong a FAD/NAD-linked reductase family, lead us to the speculation that ORF3 may be a protein related to FAD/NAD-binding. This seems consistent with the speculation that ORF3 may encode a protein related to ATP-binding [1], because FAD/NAD is generally used as an oxidant to yield ATP [9].",

The superpositions between these enzymes and ORF3 are shown in Fig. 2\n. It can be seen from the revised structure alignment (Fig. 3\n) that there are a number of similar structural patterns showing conservative residues (bold representation). In particular, among them are partially conserved FAD-bind motif (marked as \u2018#\u2019) and NAD-binding motif (marked as \u2018$\u2019) [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].

Among these interactions, Phe43 forms two N\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 bonds in a sandwich fashion: one donates to Tyr206, and one donated by Tyr160, as existed in human rac1 [15] and SARS-CoV main protease [16]. These non-canonical bindings fix the big helix Phe43 locate to the two loops Tyr160 and Tyr206 locate, hence stabilizes the structure of ORF3 protein (Fig. 4\n). These results can be used for rational design of mutagenesis experiments and analysis of conservation of interactions at functional sites.
