            "text": "In this paper, we collect and study Twitter communications to understand the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in the United States during the early days of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that COVID-19 gripped the nation during this time as is evidenced by the significant number of trending hashtags. With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. The communications reveal the ensuing panic buying and the unavailability of some essential goods, in particular toilet paper. We also observe users express their frustration in their communications as the virus spread continued. We methodically collect a total of 530,206 tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related hashtags. We then group the hashtags into six main categories, namely 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all the hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group. Our preliminary study presents a succinct and aggregated picture of people's response to the pandemic and lays the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and behavioral analysis.",

Additionally, with ever-increasing mobility of humans and goods, it is only prudent to assume that such epidemics are likely to occur in the future.

Calls for closures started off with schools (e.g., #closenycschools), then moved on to bars and restaurants (e.g., #barsshut), and finally to entire cities and states (e.g., #lockdownusa). While these calls were initially mainly confined to the Seattle, Bay Area, and NY regions (e.g., #seattleshutdown, #shutdownnyc), they later expanded to include other parts of the country (e.g., #shutdownflorida, #vegasshutdown). Alongside, panic buying and hoarding escalated with essential items particularly toilet paper becoming unavailable in stores (e.g., #panicbuying, #toiletpapercrisis). \u2022 We observe increased calls for social distancing, quarantining, and working from home to limit the spread of the disease (e.g., #socialdistancingnow, #workfromhome). To slow the exponential increase in the number of infections, people also rallied for flattening the curve and staying at home for extended periods (e.g., #flattenthecurve). The challenges of working from home also surface in communications (e.g., #stayhomechallenge). With the passage of time, we see an increased fluctuation in emotions with some people expressing their anger at individuals flouting social distancing calls (e.g., #covidiots), while others rallying people to fight the disease (e.g., #fightback) and to save workers (e.g., #saveworkers). \u2022 We group the hashtags into six main categories, namely 1)",

General COVID: In this category, we group hashtags related to COVID related messages as it is the most discussed topic in conversations. This grouping is done by accumulating hashtags related to COVID-19. 2. Quarantine: Calls for social distancing and quarantines flooded Twitter during this outbreak.

First, we identify and present the most commonly used words across all the hashtags. To construct the first group of common words across all hashtags, we remove the words that are same or similar to the hashtags mentioned in Table 2 as those words are redundant and tend to also be high in frequency. We also remove the names of places and governors such as New York, Massachusetts and Andrew Cuomo. After filtering out these words, we then rank the words based on their occurrence in multiple groups and their combined frequency across all the groups. We observe words such as family, health, death, life, work, help, thank, need, time, love, crisis. In Table 4 , we present some notable example tweets containing the common words. While one may think that health refers to the virus-related health issues, we notice that many people also refer to mental health in their tweets as a possible consequence to social distancing and anxiety caused by the virus. We also observe the usage of words such as death and crisis to indicate the seriousness of the situation. Supporting workers and showing gratitude toward them is another common tweet pattern that is worth mentioning. We plan to use these observations to guide our future exploration and fine-grained analysis. Death. We must act very fast. First, we take care of the health care and emergency workers.

To do this, we remove the common words calculated in the above step from each group. From the obtained list of words after the filtering, we then select the top 10 words. Due to lack of space, we only present results for four hashtag groups. Figure 3 gives us the uniquely identifying and semantically meaningful words in each hashtag group. In the General COVID group, we find words such as impact, response, resource, doctor. Similarly, for School Closures, we find words such as teacher, schedule, educator, book, class. The Panic Buying top words mostly resonates the shortages experienced by people during this time such as roll and tissue (referring to toilet paper), hoard, bidet (as an alternative to toilet paper), wipe, and water.

            "text": "In this paper, we studied Twitter communications in the United States during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. As the disease continued to spread, we observed that calls for closures of schools, bars, cities and entire states as well as social distancing and quarantining quickly gained fervor. Alongside, we observed an increase in panic buying and lack of availability of essential items, in particular toilet paper. We also conducted a linguistic word-usage analysis and distinguished between words that are common to multiple hashtag groups and words that uniquely and semantically identify each hashtag group. In addition to words that represent the group, our analysis unearths many words related to emotion in the tweets. Also, our qualitative analysis reveals that the words are used in multiple different contexts, which is worth delving further into. The research presented in this paper is preliminary and its primary aim is to quantitatively outline the socio-economic distress already caused by COVID-19 so that we as a society can learn from this experience and be better prepared if COVID-19 (or maybe another pandemic) were to (re)emerge in the future. At the time of writing this paper, the infection spread has still not reached its peak in the United States. Therefore, we plan to keep collecting data to understand and investigate the socio-economic and political impact of COVID-19. We plan to expand on our current research by performing topic modeling and expanding our linguistic analysis to unearth the main topics being discussed in the tweets. We also plan to conduct sentiment analysis to understand the extent of positive and negative sentiments in the tweets.",
