Twelve MCGs (i-xii) were identified among 459 S. rolfsii isolates. MCG iii was the most prevalent group in all countries except Italy. MCG i, the most abundant group (64AE7% of isolates) was identified in Portugal and Spain. The remaining MCGs were restricted to various regions within one country (ii, vi, ix) or different countries (v), or to specific localities (iv, vii, viii, x, xi, xii). MCGs iv, vii and x each comprised one isolate. Fields extensively sampled in southern Spain were infected with one to three MCGs. Plant species differed in susceptibility to MCG tester isolates with a MCG by species interaction. Cluster analyses allowed selection into five MCG groupings and grouped plant species into species-groups 1 (broccoli, chickpea, sunflower, tomato) and 2 (cotton, pepper, sugar beet, watermelon). MCG groupings 1 (i, ix), 2 (ii, iii, vi, viii) and 5 (x, xii) were moderately virulent to species-group 1 and mildly virulent to species-group 2. MCG groupings 3 (iv, v, xi) and 4 (vii) were mildly virulent to both species-groups. Across MCG groups, species were rated highly susceptible (chickpea, sunflower), susceptible (cotton, pepper, tomato, watermelon), moderately resistant (broccoli, melon, sugar beet) and resistant (corn, wheat). Establishing the MCG population structure and virulence variability among S. rolfsii isolates should help in the management of sclerotium root rot diseases.",

The host range of S. rolfsii comprises over 500 plant species, mostly dicotyledons, but also some monocotyledons (Harlton et al., 1995; Okabe et al., 1998; Cilliers et al., 2000) . The main disease symptoms caused by this pathogen include crown and root rot, stem canker or damping-off. The resulting disease is referred to as southern blight, southern stem rot, or sclerotium root rot (Aycock, 1966; Punja, 1985) . S. rolfsii produces abundant coarse, white mycelia on infected host tissues and forms sclerotia (Punja, 1985) . The fungus overwinters in soil by means of sclerotia, as well as by mycelia in infected plants or infested plant debris (Punja, 1985) . It can form a sexual stage, but this rarely occurs in nature and its role in the life cycle of the fungus is unknown (Nalim et al., 1995) .",

Characterization of fungal populations into mycelial compatibility groups (MCGs) has been widely used for indirectly assessing the genetic variability among isolates of fungal plant pathogens (Leslie, 1993) . MCGs play an important role both in defining field populations of fungi and facilitating genetic exchange in fungal species. This is particularly relevant for fungi for which sexual reproduction has a minimal impact on the disease cycle (Kohn et al., 1991; Leslie, 1993) because MCGs help to preserve the identity of genetically dissimilar mycelia and restrict the exchange of cytoplasm, genetic material and extrachromosomal elements (Caten, 1972) . Mycelial incompatibility results in separate and distinct gene pools, which may differ in ecological, physiological and pathological traits. Mycelial compatibility studies have been used to estimate genetic variability or relatedness within many fungal species of the Basidiomycota such as Sclerotium cepivorum (Earnshaw et al., 2000) and Rhizoctonia solani (Carling et al., 2002; Ciampi et al., 2008) , as well as ascomycetes such as Fusarium spp. (Puhalla, 1985; Elias et al., 1993; Chulze et al., 2000; Bayraktar et al., 2010) , Cryphonectria spp. (van Heerden & Wingfield, 2001) , Verticillium dahliae (Korolev et al., 2000; Collado-Romero et al., 2006) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Kohn et al., 1991) .",

The variability of mycelial compatibility among S. rolfsii populations occurring in particular geographic regions or specific crops has also been demonstrated. Studies in Brazil (Almeida et al., 2001) , India (Sarma et al., 2002) and South Africa (Cilliers et al., 2002) indicated that a considerable genetic variability existed among S. rolfsii isolates from various hosts and localities without clear correlation between the MCG to which they belonged and their host source or geographic origin (Almeida et al., 2001; Sarma et al., 2002) , although a certain relationship between MCGs and host source of isolates was suggested for S. rolfsii populations in South Africa (Cilliers et al., 2002) .

            "text": "Control of sclerotium root rot diseases is difficult because of the extensive mycelial growth, persistence in soil, genetic variability of populations and wide host range of S. rolfsii. In sugar beet, no resistant cultivars are available and attempts to control the disease with fungicides or biological control agents have been unsuccessful (Lal et al., 1997) . However, a degree of resistance to S. rolfsii was found in some cultivars of cowpea (Fery & Dukes, 2002) , alfalfa (Pratt & Rowe, 2002) , peanut (Branch & Brenneman, 1999) , pepper, sweet potato (Dukes et al., 1983) and chickpea (Akram et al., 2008) . Reports from California and India indicate that the pathogen inoculum density can be effectively reduced by rotations of sugar beet with crops that are slightly susceptible to S. rolfsii, such as alfalfa, asparagus, barley, corn and wheat (Schneider & Whitney, 1996) . This same strategy was also effective with rotations of susceptible carrot with sweet potato or buckwheat (Jenkins & Averre, 1986) and peanut with bahiagrass, corn, cotton (Johnson et al., 1999) or wheat (Minton et al., 1991) . Knowledge about the genetic and virulence diversity in local populations of S. rolfsii associated with different crops is a key component for the management of sclerotium root rot diseases, particularly through the use of host resistance and crop rotation in a given region. In addition, knowledge of the host range of S. rolfsii populations present in a given area is essential for recommending suitable crops as an alternative to sugar beet production. Unfortunately, information of that nature is lacking in areas of Mediterranean-type climate. Furthermore, the sugar beet production area in the Mediterranean Basin has steadily decreased in Italy, Portugal and southern Spain during the last few years, being replaced by vegetable crops that can be potentially affected by sclerotium root rot.",

Then, small plugs from the inner colony were transferred to modified Patterson's medium (MPM) in new plates (90-mm diameter) and incubated for 5 days in the same conditions. This MPM allows improved assessment of mycelial interactions among S. rolfsii isolates (E. Remesal & J. A. Navas-Cort\u00e9s, unpublished results) . Mycelial discs from the edges of actively growing MPM colonies of isolates were paired on MPM plates. Three isolates were paired on a 90-mmdiameter plate by placing discs 50 mm apart and incubating at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C in the dark. There were four replicated plates per pairing. All isolates were paired with themselves to ensure self-compatibility. All pairings were repeated twice. Pairings were examined macroscopically after 5 and 10 days of incubation for the presence of an antagonism zone in the region of mycelial contact (Punja & Grogan, 1983) and the presence of a coloured red line in the reaction zone between the colonies ( Fig. 1a,b) . Mycelial compatibility reactions showed no antagonism and were distinguished by merging colonies with no detectable coloured red line between the interacting colonies ( Fig. 1c) . MCGs were identified based on data from compatible reactions among tested isolates. Because of the high number of S. rolfsii isolates and difficulty of pairing them in all possible combinations, MCGs were defined first at field plot level, pairing isolates from a plot in all possible combinations. Then, one tester isolate was arbitrarily selected from each of the identified MCGs for further analyses. Representative tester isolates from all the identified MCGs in each field plot were paired in all possible combinations (Nalim et al., 1995) .",

For inoculation, two selected oat seeds heavily and homogenously colonized with mycelia of an isolate were buried at a depth of 0AE5 cm and a distance of 0AE5-1 cm from the plant stem. Plants in pots with non-infested seeds served as controls. Plants were incubated in a walk-in growth chamber adjusted to 28 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with a 14-h photoperiod of fluorescent light of 360 lE m )2 s )1 and 60-90% relative humidity for 18 days. Plants were watered as needed to maintain field capacity and fertilized weekly with 100 mL 0AE1% hydro-sol fertilizer solution (Haifa Chemicals, Ltd, 20-5-32 N-P-K + micronutrients). tion. S. rolfsii isolates were classified in terms of virulence based on the disease incidence (DI) that they induced: highly virulent (DI \u2021 66%), moderately virulent (66 < DI \u2021 33%), mildly virulent (33 < DI > 0%) and non-pathogenic (DI = 0%). Similarly, plant species were classified according to DI values as: highly susceptible (DI \u2021 66%), susceptible (66 < DI \u2021 33%), moderately resistant (33 < DI > 0%) or resistant (DI = 0%). The number of dead plants per treatment was used for statistical analyses. Data were analysed with the GENMOD procedure using the binomial distribution and the logit as link function in SAS (version 9AE2, SAS Institute Inc.) (Agresti, 2002) . Least squares means were computed for all response variables to allow multiple comparisons between \u2044 among treatments by using the SAS macro MULT (https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/bioinformatik/beratung/ toolsmacros/sasmacros/mult.sas) (Piepho, 2004) . Linear single-degree-of-freedom contrasts were computed to test the effect of selected experimental treatment combinations. The stability of disease reactions in the plantspecies by MCG combination was explored by cluster analyses of the number of dead plants to identify associated groupings of MCGs and plant species in two separate analyses. To find functional groupings of correlated MCGs or plant species, respectively, an agglomerative clustering based on the Spearman correlation matrix was performed among MCGs and among plant species using the Ward clustering method. For MCGs, the optimum number of clusters was estimated on the basis of the average silhouette width according to the Mantel statistic. Thus, the number of clusters in which the within-group mean intensity of the link of the objects (MCG) to their groups was highest (i.e. with the largest average silhouette width) indicated the optimum cluster number. A new dendrogram was then produced representing the identified groupings of MCGs (Borcard et al., 2011) . All calculations for cluster analyses were made using R version 2AE13AE0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, http://www.R-project.org/) with the CLUSTER (Maechler et al., 2005) and VEGAN (Oksanen et al., 2011) packages.",

In this analysis, four to seven cluster groupings could be appropriate according to the silhouettes' mean width. This allowed selection of five functional MCG groupings among the 12 MCGs of the study which included: MCG grouping 1 (MCGs i and ix), MCG grouping 2 (MCGs ii, iii, vi and viii), MCG grouping 3 (MCGs iv, v and xi), MCG grouping 4 (MCG vii) and MCG grouping 5 (MCGs x and xii) (Fig. 5a) . Similarly, plant species could be grouped into two plant species (SP) groups, namely SP group 1 (chickpea, broccoli, sunflower and tomato) and SP group 2 (cotton, pepper, sugar beet and watermelon) according to the two-first-order cluster groups identified in the cluster analysis (Fig. 5b) . Thereafter, a new analysis was performed using MCG groupings and SP groups as independent variables, which indicated significant effects of both factors (P \u00a3 0AE0495), as well as of their interaction (P = 0AE0012) ( Table 2 ). This interaction was the result of disease incidence induced by isolates of MCG groupings 1, 2 and 5 being higher (P \u00a3 0AE0319) on SP group 1 than on SP group 2, whereas isolates of MCG groupings 3 and 4 induced similar disease incidence (P \u2021 0AE0902) on SP groups 1 and 2 (Table 2) . Additionally, a separate analysis was performed for each SP group to further assess the effects of MCG groupings on disease incidence induced by S. rolfsii isolates on the plant species included in each SP group. Results indicated no significant (P \u2021 0AE05) MCG-grouping by plant-species interaction for the two SP groups (Table 3) . Overall, for SP group 1, disease reaction to inoculation was significantly influenced both by the MCG grouping and plant species (P < 0AE0001) but not by their interaction (P = 0AE2026) ( Table 3) . DI was highest (P < 0AE05) for isolates of MCG groupings 1, 2 and 5, which showed moderate virulence, and decreased significantly (P < 0AE05) for MCG groupings 3 and 4, which were mildly virulent (Fig. 6a) . Among plant species, DI was highest (P < 0AE05) on chickpea, which was categorized as highly susceptible, decreased significantly (P < 0AE05) on sunflower, which was categorized as susceptible, and was least (P < 0AE05) on tomato and broccoli, which were considered moderately resistant with no significant differences (P \u2021 0AE05) between these two species (Fig. 6a) . No significant differences (P = 0AE0681) occurred among MCG groupings on SP group 2 (Table 3 ; Fig. 6b ). Across plant species in SP group 2, disease incidence was highest (P < 0AE05) on cotton and pepper, which showed susceptible reactions, and decreased significantly (P < 0AE05) to a moderately susceptible reaction on sugar beet. DI on watermelon was intermediate between those occurring on the three species of SP group 2 and did not differ significantly (P \u2021 0AE05) from any of them (Fig. 6b) .",

            "text": "There was little variation in the disease reaction induced on sunflower, tomato and watermelon by S. rolfsii isolates belonging to the same MCG (Fig. 7) . Thus, likelihood analyses showed no significant differences (P \u2021 0AE5350) among S. rolfsii isolates belonging to either MCG iii, v, vi or xii (Table 4) . Moreover, disease reactions induced by isolates of each of these four MCGs were not significantly different (P \u2021 0AE05) from those in experiments I and II. An exception to this occurred for isolates of MCG i, which showed significant differences between each other (P < 0AE0001) (Table 4, Fig. 7) . In any case, of the 12 MCG i isolates tested, only the disease reaction induced by isolate Sr033 differed significantly (P = 0AE0068) from that induced by the MCG i type isolate Sr078 (Fig. 7) . Comparison of the disease reaction induced by this isolate with those induced by the rest of the MCG i isolates indicated that Sr033 was more virulent to all three plant species (Fig. 7) . For all five MCGs tested, there were no significant (P \u2021 0AE4638) isolate by plant-species interactions (Table 4) . terranean-type climate were characterized by means of MCG analysis and pathogenicity to 11 economically important plant species cultivated in those regions. It was demonstrated that differences in virulence occur among isolates from certain locations and that these differences can be associated with genetic diversity based on MCGs of isolates. In addition, variation at field level was assessed by intensive sampling of plots at several locations in southern Spain. A system of mycelial incompatibility was previously demonstrated to occur among field isolates of S. rolfsii and was used to designate MCGs (Punja & Grogan, 1983) . This study was able to identify up to 12 MCGs among 459 S. rolfsii isolates originating from a wide geographic range but a single host crop. This is apparently novel work in S. rolfsii because previously published work has involved S. rolfsii isolates from: (i) widely distant geographic areas and diverse host sources (Punja & Grogan, 1983; Harlton et al., 1995; Punja & Sun, 2001) ; (ii) a restricted region and diverse hosts (Cilliers et al., 2000 (Cilliers et al., , 2002 Almeida et al., 2001; Sarma et al., 2002) ; and (iii) a single region and host plant (Nalim et al., 1995; Okabe & Matsumoto, 2000; Adandonon et al., 2005) . Two abundant and prevalent MCGs (MCGs i and iii) were found. Some other MCGs were: (a) less prevalent but present in various regions of different countries (MCG v) or regions within a country (MCGs ii, vi and ix); (b) restricted to specific localities (MCGs viii, xi and xii); or (c) single-isolate member groups (MCGs iv, vii and x).",

            "text": "In southern Spain, S. rolfsii was reported infecting sugar beet crops in some localities in C\u00f3 rdoba and Seville provinces in the centre of Andalusia in the early 1940s (Benlloch, 1943) . By 1944, the pathogen had also been reported in C\u00e1 ceres province in the Extremadura region of southwest Spain, close to the Portuguese border (Dom\u00ednguez Garc\u00eda-Tejero, 1951) . Interestingly, this coincided with when the crop sowing date was brought forward from spring to early winter (Morillo-Velarde et al., 2003) , which appears more favourable for disease development (Aycock, 1966; Punja, 1985) . In autumn sowings, several important changes were implemented in the husbandry of sugar beet, which included complete mechanization of harvesting using heavy equipment. Thus, movement of equipment across fields, together with transportation of harvested roots from fields to distant processing factories, may have facilitated dispersal of the pathogen in soil particles and could be responsible for the rapid spread of MCGs i and iii through Andalusia (Fig. 2) . On the other hand, sugar beet has been extensively grown in Portugal since the late 1990s (FAOSTAT, 2010) , and sclerotium root rot was of great concern in the major growing areas of central and southern Portugal in 2003, at which time a disease prevalence of 21% of fields Sclerotium rolfsii isolates representative of mycelial compatibility groups (MCGs) grouped into five MCG groupings (x-axis) and eight plant species (y-axis) grouped into species-group (SP) 1 (a) and SP group 2 (b). Plant species: Br, broccoli; Ck, chickpea; Ct, cotton; Pp, pepper; Sb, sugar beet; Sf, sunflower; To, tomato; and Wm, watermelon. For each SP group, MCG groupings or plant species followed by a different letter showed significant differences on the least squares means at P < 0AE05. MCG groupings with an asterisk indicate a significantly higher least squares mean for disease incidence induced on SP group 1, compared to that on SP group 2 at P < 0AE05.",

In Chile, sugar beet has been grown since the early 1950s and S. rolfsii was first reported in the central regions affecting diverse crops in 1981 (Esterio & Auger, 1982) and on sugar beet in the Metropolitan region and V region in 1983 (Acu\u00f1 a, 1985) . Thereafter, the pathogen spread to the southern regions reaching the VIII region in 1999 (R. Paillalef-Monnrad, IANSAGRO, Chile, personal communication). MCG iii was the most prevalent group in the current study, being present in two of four, three of eight and all five locations sampled in Chile, Spain and Portugal, respectively. This suggests that MCG iii may have been spread extensively within and among cultivated areas by cultural practices, vehicle movements, planting material, containers, etc. The existence of S. rolfsii isolates of the same MCG in different distant countries was also reported by Harlton et al. (1995) , who identified MCG 8 in the USA (Alabama, California and Maryland) and Pakistan; and MCG 1 in the USA (California, Georgia and North Carolina) and Mexico. Similarly, Kull et al.

            "text": "The present results are also consistent with those of other authors, suggesting a correlation between MCG and geographical source of isolates, as S. rolfsii isolates originating from the same locality tended to form a distinct MCG (Punja & Grogan, 1983; Harlton et al., 1995; Cilliers et al., 2000 Cilliers et al., , 2002 Punja & Sun, 2001; Sarma et al., 2002) . In fact, three of the 12 MCGs identified (MCGs ii, vi and ix) were found only at two close localities and six were present at a single locality. This was the case of MCG iv, which was identified exclusively in Bari (Italy), MCGs vii, viii, x and xii, which were present in each of four different localities in Chile, and MCG xi, which was identified only in Huelva (Spain) (Fig. 2) . In a comparable study, Nalim et al. (1995) found that a rather small number of MCGs existed within single peanut fields in Texas. Localization of unique S. sclerotiorum MCGs was also observed in vegetable-growing regions in New Zealand (Carpenter et al., 1999) and on winter canola in Ontario, Canada (Kohn et al., 1991) . Explanations for unique low-frequency MCGs in a sampling area may include recent MCG introductions or random mutation events. The emergence of new genotypes localized in single fields may be an indication of MCGs or clones becoming adapted to specific field microclimates or hosts, and are less likely to be the result of genetic exchange and recombination (Ben-Yephet & Bitton, 1985; Hambleton Figure 7 Two-way plot showing results of likelihood analyses of disease reaction estimated by the number of dead plants of sunflower (Sf), tomato (To) and watermelon (Wm) (x-axis) to infection by 23 Sclerotium rolfsii isolates representative of five of the more prevalent mycelial compatibility groups (MCG) (y-axis) identified in this study. Isolates tested included 12 isolates for MCG i, four isolates for MCG iii, three for MCG v, and two for each of MCG vi and MCG xii. The type isolate for each MCG is underlined. For each MCG, isolates followed by a different letter showed significant differences in the least squares means at P < 0AE05. Isolates with an asterisk indicate significantly different least squares means from that of the type isolate at P < 0AE05. , 2002) . The existence of single-member MCGs was also reported with variable frequency in different geographic areas and \u2044 or host sources (Punja & Grogan, 1983; Harlton et al., 1995; Nalim et al., 1995; Cilliers et al., 2000; Okabe & Matsumoto, 2000; Almeida et al., 2001; Punja & Sun, 2001; Sarma et al., 2002) . The population of the pathogen in Chile was particularly diverse. The area sampled for the study in that country was similar in size to that in southern Spain. However, MCGs identified in Chile accounted for half of the 12 MCGs identified in the study, of which five were found only in this country. Moreover, a single location in Chile could contain up to three different MCGs, as occurred in Linares (MCGs viii, ix and xii) and Chill\u00e1 n (MCGs iii, ix and x). The existence of considerable genetic variability among S. rolfsii isolates was also reported in Brazil, where 13 compatibility groups were identified using 30 isolates from 14 states and 11 hosts (Almeida et al., 2001) .",

In these fields, three, two and one MCGs were identified in one, five and two fields, respectively. MCG i was always present, being unique and predominant in two and four fields, respectively (Figs 2 and 3) . Interestingly, the number of MCGs in a field was not related to the number of S. rolfsii isolates sampled in it. Thus, for a similar sampled area the number of isolates ranged from 28 to 80, the field harbouring three MCGs being represented by 31 isolates. These results do not fully agree with those reported by Nalim et al. (1995) , who studied four peanut fields in Texas and found one, three and five MCGs in one, two and one field, respectively. However, none of the MCGs reported by Nalim et al. (1995) were prevalent across fields, as only one MCG was present in two fields, while the others were specific to each field. In contrast, the results of the present study are closer to those of Okabe & Matsumoto (2000) in peanut fields in Japan. These authors analysed seven peanut fields and identified four MCGs, with up to three MCGs occurring in a single field and one MCG being dominant in most of the fields sampled. In similar studies on S. sclerotiorum, Kohn et al. (1991) found much higher variability within two canola fields in Ontario, Canada, where they identified 26 and six MCGs from 30 and 33 isolates, respectively, with two MCGs being predominant in one field, and only one MCG being common to the two fields. Similar results were described for the MCG population structure of S. sclerotiorum on soyabean in Argentina and Illinois (USA) (Kull et al., 2004) . The present observations and those of Nalim et al. (1995) and Okabe & Matsumoto (2000) are coherent with a 'founder effect' and may reflect the mode of reproduction of S. rolfsii, which does not produce conidia and spreads by mycelial growth. Whilst S. rolfsii does have a perfect stage, its role in nature is not fully understood. In contrast, sexual reproduction in S. sclerotiorum and a greater selection for specific MCGs in populations of this fungus com-pared with that in S. rolfsii may account for the smaller number of S. rolfsii MCGs found per field in this study. Thus, in the six sugar beet fields in southern Spain comprising more than one S. rolfsii MCG, the MCGs appeared scattered within distinct disease foci with no discernible spatial pattern. This agrees with reports on S. rolfsii in peanut fields in Texas (Nalim et al., 1995) or S. sclerotiorum on soyabean in Illinois (Kull et al., 2004) .",

To some extent, these results agree with those of Flores- Moctezuma et al. (2006) who evaluated the reactions of 12 plant species to a set of 20 non-MCG-typed S. rolfsii isolates collected from different agricultural and ecological areas in Mexico. These authors found that gooseberry, lentil, pumpkin, radish and tomato were susceptible to all tested isolates, whereas the degree of susceptibility of the remaining seven species varied widely with the isolate. In the present study, sugar beet cv. Markus was susceptible, moderately susceptible and resistant to isolates from one, eight and three MCGs, respectively. Similarly, Sharma et al. (1991) found that only one of five S. rolfsii isolates from different sugar beet-growing areas in northwest India was highly virulent to sugar beet in artificial inoculations.",

            "text": "The results of this study have important implications for the management of sclerotium root rot of sugar beet in Mediterranean-type climates, particularly in relation to crop rotation and choice of appropriate crops for use in infested soils previously cropped to sugar beet. Crop rotations are essential to maintain crop productivity and reduce the build-up of soilborne plant pathogens and diseases, which can devastate crops grown in multiple consecutive years (Cook, 2000) . Generally, the degree of control is based on the level of susceptibility or resistance of crops involved and the sequences of cropping. In the present study, monocotyledonous species (wheat and corn) were resistant to all MCGs tested and thus are suitable for rotation with susceptible crops. These results agree with those of Boyle (1967) , who indicated a reduction in the incidence of sclerotium root rot in peanut fields following a monocotyledonous crop, as well as with those of Minton et al. (1991) , who reported that disease incidence in a wheat-peanut rotation was lower than that in a fallow-peanut rotation. Similarly, disease incidence was the lowest in peanut following 2 years of bahiagrass, intermediate following 2 years of corn or cotton, and highest in continuous peanut (Johnson et al., 1999) . Nevertheless, results of this present study suggest that S. rolfsii isolates in any of the identified MCGs were able to cause different levels of plant mortality in at least six of the nine susceptible plant species tested. This, together with the occurrence of up to three different MCGs within a field plot or locality differing in pathogenic and virulence profiles, make it difficult to recommend crop rotation as a sole control measure. It would be of interest to evaluate the risk of occurrence of severe epidemics on a given crop based on the prevalence of a given MCG of the pathogen. This would be of importance for southern Spain and Portugal, where vegetable crops such as carrots, peppers, tomato, etc. are becoming alternative crops for sugar beet as a result of the sugar beet production area being drastically reduced or nearly eliminated, respectively. Consequently, sclerotium root rot diseases can become an important threat for vegetable crop production in these areas, as was recently reported for pepper fields in southern Spain (Remesal et al., 2010) .",
