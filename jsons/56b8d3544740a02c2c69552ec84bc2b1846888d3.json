This kind of teaching model emphasizes on the training of student's math skills, spatial imagination, logical thinking skills, neglecting the training of their mathematical application ability and mathematical awareness, such as the ability of finding out actual mathematical problem, refining the problem, the use of mathematical language and mathematical model to describe the problem [3] , using mathematical tools to solve practical problems. Under this circumstance, the students get no idea of the origin of mathematical concepts and the use of Mathematics. They learn Mathematics just because they have to learn, without any interest and enthusiasm, some of them even fear of it and dislike it. So we integrate the knowledge of Mathematics and the case study of Mathematic Modeling in our Mathematics classes, we also carry the teaching idea as the main point to design Advanced Mathematics Teaching Quality Evaluation System.

So it's necessary for the mathematics teachers to have a better understanding of the background of the mathematician's achievements and their way of thinking. Seeing through the appearance to perceive the essence, we can get more instructive conclusion and inspire a new spark of idea. Getting rid of the contingency and mystery of creativity in mathematics teaching. Most teachers only teach mechanically, neglecting the development process from the appearance to essence, which usually confuses the students in the study \"unfathomable\" mathematics: it seems that scientists have been able to achieve great success just because of their so-called \"special mind\", with God on their preference. As everyone knows, the birth of any theoretical system is a process of evolution: from the emotional to the rational perception, from immaturity to maturity. It is wise to provide them some knowledge of the branch of mathematics formation and the history of birth for basic theory and basic concepts, which is helpful for students to form a good knowledge structure and get rid of the contingency and mystery of creativity in mathematics teaching.",

The vitality of mathematics lies in solving all kinds of problems from real life effectively. How to convert the practical problem to mathematical model is a test to the students' abilities of solving problems creatively, which is also a important task of mathematical teaching. So mathematical modeling idea should be permeated in the process of teaching. Student should be instructed that when confronted with practical problems, they should try to find proper model in the lessons which have been taught before and then study the problems with the properties of model or problem-solving thinking. For example, the theory about the nature of continuous function on the closed interval is strong. After introducing theory, the model of the chair stability can be introduced that how to balance a chair on undulating ground. In the process of explaining derivative applications, some practical problems can be introduces such as instantaneous speed, marginal revenue and so on. In some parts of differential equation chapters, epidemic model can be inserted. Combining the SARS virus in 2003, using differential equation model can analysis the variation of the number of infected person. Thus, the applications of mathematical modeling methods to solve practical problems can make boring mathematical problems more specific, which will increase the students' curiosity and improve students' application of mathematical skills as well.",
