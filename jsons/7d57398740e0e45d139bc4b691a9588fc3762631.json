Correspondingly, the cited references provide optimally-robust procedures to deal with each type of outliers separately, but in case of IO-robustness does not say much about the implementation. We discuss this in more detail in this paper. Most importantly, we define a hybrid filter combining AO-and IO-optimal ones, which is able to treat both types of outliers simultaneously, albeit with a certain delay. We check our filters at a reference state space model, and compare the results with those obtained by the ACM filter Masreliez and Martin (1977) , Martin (1979) and non-parametric, repeated-median based filters Fried et al. (2006 ), Fried et al. (2007 .",

For consistency with literature, we stick to this distinction, but rather use these terms in a wider sense: IO's stand for general endogenous outliers entering the state equation, hence with propagated distortion, also covering level shifts or linear trends which would not be included in the original definition. Similarly wide-sense AO's denote general exogenous outliers which do not propagate, like substitutive outliers or SO's as defined in equations (18) Different and competing goals induced by AO's and IO's. Due to their different nature, as a rule, a different reaction in the presence of IO's and AO's is required. As AO's are exogenous, we would like to ignore them as far as possible, damping their effect, while when there are IO's, something has happened in the system, so the usual goal will be to detect these structural changes as fast as possible.",
