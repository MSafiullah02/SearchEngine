In order to manage the extent of this pandemic, there is a need to develop, disseminate and implement infection prevention and control strategies in both healthcare settings and the community. Early on in the outbreak, there were general recommendations to frequently wash hands to reduce the spread of infection. With the current, relentless global scale of COVID-19, international compliance with handwashing frequency and technique is more important than ever.",

In addition to needing to remember all six steps of the technique and needing to wash hands for the required duration of time, there can be a lack of awareness regarding the importance of handwashing technique on reducing the microbial burden on hands. This lack of awareness may not be surprising, as most hand hygiene promotion campaigns focus on indications for action (\"when to clean hands\") rather than on technique (\"how to clean hands\") [2] . Thus, continuing to promote correct handwashing technique is currently of utmost importance to the world population, especially given the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on older adults, and emerging evidence of asymptomatic shedding [3, 4] .",

In the context of the 3/6 evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the near-ubiquitous melody of Brother John provided an opportunity for international, interdisciplinary collaboration to translate and rapidly disseminate the musical mnemonic globally. On 19 th March, drawing on our combined network of music neuroscience researchers, music education specialists and healthcare professionals, we invited approximately 40 international colleagues to create a new version of the handwashing song that a) included all six WHO handwashing steps; b) worked musically in the new language; and c) had been checked by a healthcare professional for accuracy. Each translator was also invited to submit an audio or video file of the translated song. We Brother John is an ideal tune to use in this context: it is widely known across cultures; the melody involves very simple, repeating patterns; the vocal range centres around a small interval of a sixth (e.g. middle C to A), which is easy to sing even by non-musically trained individuals; and the duration, when sung at a steady tempo, is between 20 and 25 seconds. Singing is a highly sequential, structured activity and has been used throughout history to remember text or coordinate movement, from ballads and religious scriptures to work songs and children's action songs. Experimentally, music has been shown to facilitate verbal and motor learning in a variety of contexts, likely using neural resources shared between music, language and motor networks [6] [7] [8] . In practice, we have observed that, once the handwashing song becomes highly familiar through repetition and rehearsal, a missed step is immediately noticed, leading to important self-correcting behavior.",

In launching these translated songs during a pandemic that underlines our global interconnectedness, and to highlight 2020 World Hand Hygiene Day on 5 th May, we have made these songs available at www.CleanHandsSaveLives.org/hand-washing-song/, hoping this mnemonic will inspire individuals to take matters into their own hands and reduce their risk of acquiring or spreading COVID-19.
