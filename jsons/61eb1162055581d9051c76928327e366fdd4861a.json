Clinical presentations associated with COVID-19 are variable in severity, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care (2, 3) . In symptomatic individuals, COVID-19 typically manifests as an influenza-like respiratory illness, with fever, cough, dyspnea, and malaise/myalgias (4) . Atypical presentations, however, are frequent and include extrapulmonary involvement such as gastrointestinal symptoms, multi-organ failure (liver, kidneys, heart), and neurologic manifestations (5-7) ( Figure 1 ). Recently, there has been increasing recognition of neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19, prompting this review of treatment strategies for the management of delirium in these patients.",

We have seen that some patients are admitted with confusion and agitation as their presenting symptom, in the absence of respiratory symptoms or other signs of infection. In addition to significant agitation and attentional impairment, exams have been notable in varying degrees for myoclonus, rigidity, alogia, and abulia (15) . As such, we have tailored our exams to specifically evaluate for catatonia and akinetic mutism. We also focus our chart review on ruling out alternative causes of delirium and potential neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 (i.e. stroke, seizure).",

The severity of systemic illness (and the associated metabolic derangements and inflammatory cascades) in some COVID-19 patients is likely sufficient to cause the toxicmetabolic encephalopathy often seen in hospitalized patients. However, some features of SARS-CoV-2 and specifically the presentation of patients with severe confusional states in the absence of respiratory symptoms or other organ failure, have raised questions about possible alternative mechanisms of CNS injury. Cases of SARS-CoV-2-associated encephalitis (16) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been recently described (17) . Anosmia and ageusia may be early features of SARS-CoV-2 infection (18) , implying direct invasion of the olfactory bulb. These revelations have led several investigators to propose multiple potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may induce mental status changes in its victims, including infectious spread to the CNS by retrograde transport or hematogenous spread, dysregulation of cytokine activation leading to CNS inflammation, induction of cell-mediated CNS inflammation, post-infectious autoimmune reactions via molecular mimicry, and hypoxemic/thrombotic neuronal injury (5, 19) . Some authors have also hypothesized that hematogenous spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the periventricular system may lead a clinical picture of akinetic mutism even in the absence of a lesion detected on neuroimaging (15) .",

More recent data also suggests specific utility in COVID-19, perhaps due to its sleep-regulating, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective factors (21) (22) (23) . In theory, the age-related decline in melatonin levels may be one factor contributing to increased delirium risk and worse COVID-19 outcomes among elderly patients. Melatonin exerts its soporific effects through circadian entrainment and may also offer neuroprotection via increased BDNF expression and attenuation of N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated glutamate excitotoxicity, as well as the prevention of kainic acid-induced neuronal lesions, glutathione depletion, and reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptotic nerve cell death (24) (25) (26) . It also has a relatively good safety profile. We recommend considering the addition of melatonin in all COVID-19 patients. It is worth noting, however, that for patients with severe immunocompromise, the immunosuppressive effects of melatonin may be detrimental. Though speculative, it is possible that there is heterogeneity in the COVID-19 patients who develop ARDS -those who do not mount enough of an immune response, and those whose overactive immune response leads to cytokine storm. Melatonin might be particularly useful in the latter group.",

Nonetheless, for COVID-19 patients with severe agitation, the use of lorazepam in combination with antipsychotic agents may allow for greater sedation and lower the risk of EPS. This is especially true for patients who have been on prolonged high dose benzodiazepine drips in the ICU setting and may experience withdrawal if tapered too quickly. Recommendations for the management of delirium in the United Kingdom have also commented on the potential utility of benzodiazepines in COVID-19 delirium (61) .

A recent meta-regression analysis demonstrated strong evidence that vitamin C shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients, particularly severely ill patients who required mechanical ventilation for more than ten hours, and it is currently being studied as a COVID-19 intervention (62, 63) . Low levels of Vitamin D have been correlated with risk of delirium (64, 65) , and omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced patient-days with delirium and mechanical ventilation (66) . Indeed, vitamin C, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids have all been shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and may work synergistically against the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 and specifically against the neuro-inflammation associated with its delirium (67) (68) (69) .",

It remains unclear whether these patients are suffering from catatonia, which may be related to underlying psychiatric illness, delirium, or the infection itself, or a related phenomenon, such as akinetic mutism, which may have features overlapping with catatonia. For patients exhibiting alogia, abulia, immobility and withdrawal, consultation-liaison psychiatrists should consider using dopamine agonists and avoiding antipsychotics. Amantadine has been recommended as a third line agent in catatonia and is also the treatment of choice for akinetic mutism (59, 72) . Benzodiazepines may also be useful in this setting, despite the potential to worsen delirium.",

Many patients admitted with COVID-19 will likely receive this medication. Remdesivir is metabolized by CYP450 2C8, 2D6, and 3A4, and could potentially interact with psychiatric medications; blood levels of remdesivir may decrease when administered with CYP450 inducers such as phenobarbital and carbamazepine (73). Consultation-psychiatrists are strongly encouraged to perform an interaction check when selecting pharmacologic agents for delirium in patients receiving remdesivir. Of note, we performed a Lexicomp interaction check for all medications reviewed in this article with remdesivir and found no significant interactions.",

Our recommendations take into account anecdotal observations that some patients with COVID-19 delirium appear to have increased rates of myoclonus, rigidity, alogia, and abulia, suggesting a dopamine depletion state or catatonia-spectrum condition. When there are no absolute contraindications to any particular class of medication, we preferentially use alpha-2 agonists and low potency antipsychotics to manage behavioral disturbance. We nonetheless recommend a thoughtful, individualized, step-based approach to management.",

Objective measures such as MRI, EEG and cerebrospinal fluid studies would be particularly useful in understanding the neurobiology of the condition but are currently limited by the necessity of minimizing staff exposure to COVID-19. We expect that as more cases are identified and treated, our understanding of the pathophysiology will improve, and recommendations for managing delirium may evolve.",
