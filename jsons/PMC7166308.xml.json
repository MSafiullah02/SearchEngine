This pneumonia is a newly recognized illness that has spread rapidly across the country and around the world. A few days after the initial outbreak, Chinese scientists managed to identify a novel coronavirus [1], which was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is classified as a \u00df CoV of group 2B and has at least similarity in genetic sequence to severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1). SARS is a zoonosis caused by SARS-CoV-1, which first appeared in China in 2002 and spread to 29 countries in 2003, causing a global outbreak with 8903 cases [2].",

The previous studies reported only the epidemiological findings, the clinical presentation, and the clinical outcomes. However, more specific information identifying critically ill patients remains unknown. Recently, cardiac injury has been reported to be associated with mortality [5]. The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is substantial [6]. Older patients with comorbidities and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are at increased risk of death [6]. Therefore, studying the association of acute cardiac injury with the mortality in COVID-19 is essential and justified for prevention and preparation in the hospitals facing these global pandemics.",
