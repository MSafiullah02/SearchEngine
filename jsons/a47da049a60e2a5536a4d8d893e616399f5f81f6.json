During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, health care workers accounted for 21% of victims worldwide, and 43% of SARS patients in Toronto were health care workers. 1 This was likely multifactorial, including a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), unrecognized cases, and inadequate PPE used. 1, 2 This risk was greatest to nurses working in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units. 2 Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are interventions that can cause airborne infectious particles to be propelled into the air. Due to their small size and potential to be suspended in the air for prolonged periods, additional precautions are required for health care workers who are exposed to AGMPs.",
