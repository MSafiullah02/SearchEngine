Significance was defined as P<0.05 after multiplying P by 125 study-wide comparisons. Of 2,864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care after a median of 4.5 days, with 56 requiring inpatient readmission. The most common reason for return was respiratory distress (50%). Compared to patients who did not return, among those who returned there was a higher proportion of COPD (6.8% vs 2.9%) and hypertension (36% vs 22.1%). Patients who returned also had a shorter median length of stay (LOS) during index hospitalization (4.5 [2.9,9.1] vs. 6.7 [3.5, 11.5] days; P adjusted =0.006), and were less likely to have required intensive care on index hospitalization (5.8% vs 19%; P adjusted =0.001). A trend towards association between absence of in-hospital anticoagulation on index admission and return to hospital was also observed (20.9% vs 30.9%, P adjusted =0.064). On readmission, rates of intensive care and death were 5.8% and 3.6%, respectively. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

            "text": "We included patients at least 18 years old with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted and subsequently discharged alive from five MSHS hospitals. Data were collected from electronic health records (EHR). Patients were excluded if discharge occurred after April 12, 2020 to ensure all patients had at least a 14-day observation for possible readmission. A COVID-related hospital admission included any inpatient encounter with detected SARS-CoV-2 from an order within the first 48 hours of the encounter, including time spent in the emergency department, or within 48-hours of an antecedent lab diagnosis-only visit to an outpatient setting. Given the vast amount of information contained in the EHR, variables were chosen in this analysis based on a combination of both their prevalence per patient across the dataset, relevance to COVID based on previous literature and empirical evidence, and appropriate goals of this study. This variable selection, culling, and cleanup was performed through exhaustive manual inspection by clinicians. Labs with >80% missingness were subsequently excluded, resulting in an a priori set of 125 variables for comparison of the primary endpoint. Of these 125 variables (all of which are accounted for through multiple hypothesis testing), 66 are shown in Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1 to highlight pertinent positive and negative findings most salient to results interpretation. Patients were excluded if they were still hospitalized, discharged < 14 days prior to the data freeze on April 26th, 2020, returned <12 hours after discharge, or died during the index admission. Variables collected included demographics, vitals and laboratory measurements on time of discharge from index hospitalization, disease diagnoses, comorbidities, procedures during hospitalization (including intubation and non-invasive O 2 oxygen support), ICU course, and outcomes (death or hospital discharge). Comorbidities were extracted using International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9/10 billing codes for atrial fibrillation (AF), asthma, coronary artery disease (CAD), cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes (DM), heart failure (HF), and hypertension (HTN). History and physical exam findings were extracted from the initial note with a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm cross-validated against findings extracted manually by medical students. Chest X-rays were screened for infiltrates from the corresponding report by the radiologist using an NLP algorithm similarly cross-validated against findings extracted manually by medical students.

Age, sex, and race/ethnicity were not different in patients returning to the hospital compared to those who did not return, however there was a higher prevalence of hypertension and COPD. Second, the most common cause for returning to hospital was respiratory distress accounting for half of all symptoms on return. Finally, returning patients had shorter LOS on index hospitalization with notably a lower frequency of ICU care and inpatient anticoagulation.

Thus, generalizability may be limited due to a possible temporal bias, necessitating extension of current studies to longer time periods. Third, readmission over a 30-day horizon may permit comparative analyses with readmission rates for other diseases to inform impact on systems-level operations. Finally, the number of readmissions may have been underreported due to presentation to hospitals outside of the Mount Sinai Health system that could not be tracked via EHR.",
