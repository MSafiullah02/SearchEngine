            "text": "The RNA world hypothesis provides a conceptual framework for the early development of life on earth in which RNA functions both as a molecule capable of propagating genetic information and as a catalyst. The capacity of RNA to transmit genetic information is exemplified by the RNA viruses, which can have genomes up to 30 kb in length consisting entirely of RNA (Lai and Cavanagh 1997). Ribozymes generated by in vitro directed RNA sequence evolution (Ellington and Szostak 1990; Tuerk and Gold 1990) and natural ribozymes such as self-splicing introns (Cech et al. 1981; Kruger et al. 1982) are important examples of catalytic RNAs that serve as paradigms for the catalytic role of RNA in a prebiotic world. RNA molecules with RNA polymerase activity have been evolved in the laboratory (Johnston et al. 2001; Attwater et al. 2013), and a pair of RNA ligase ribozymes have been shown to cross-replicate each other by ligation in an exponential manner (Lincoln and Joyce 2009). Although RNA-catalyzed RNA replication is likely to have been important for primitive cells in the RNA world, it is also possible that non-enzymatic RNA replication may have played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the emergence of the first cells. Since at this stage neither RNA-catalyzed nor purely chemically driven RNA replication have been demonstrated, it is reasonable to consider routes to the assembly of protocells based on either mode of RNA replication. In either case, replicating RNAs must be compartmentalized to allow for the evolution of functional RNAs that confer a selective advantage to the protocell within which they reside.",

Compartmentalization of genomic RNA molecules without (or with only rare) exchange between protocells is essential for any protocell model as it would allow RNA sequences with desirable properties, such as catalytic ribozymes, to be segregated from other RNAs and to selectively replicate and evolve over time (Szostak et al. 2001; Szabo et al. 2002). Phospholipids are the major building blocks in modern cell membranes, however phospholipid membranes are largely impermeable to charged molecules (Chen and Walde 2010) and are therefore problematic as the basis of protocell compartmentalization. However, membranes composed of fatty acids and related single chain amphiphiles are permeable to small polar and even charged molecules, and have additional properties that are favorable for protocell growth and division (Budin and Szostak 2011). Nevertheless, the simplicity of membrane free protocell models is intriguing and makes such systems worth further exploration.",

            "text": "Droplets formed by phase separation in an aqueous environment, such as aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) and charge-complex coacervates, have been proposed as model protocells (Oparin 1953; Fox 1976; Liebl et al. 1984; Koga et al. 2011; Keating 2012; Mann 2012, 2013). Both ATPSs (Albertsson 1971; Walter et al. 1985; Zaslavsky 1995) and coacervates (Dufrenoy and Reed 1946; Oparin et al. 1961) have long been known to lead to the partitioning of specific molecules into different phases in an overall aqueous environment. In biotechnological applications, ATPSs composed of dextran and polyethylene glycol (PEG) are commonly used to partition whole bacterial cells (Stendahl et al. 1977), cellular organelles (Albertsson 1958), and macromolecules (Hatti-kaul 2001); RNA, for example, partitions into the more polar dextran-rich phase (Zaslavsky 1992). Some properties of ATPSs and coacervates could have been advantageous in the development of early cells. Their ability to concentrate primitive reactants and catalysts, such as ribozymes, could increase reaction rates without requiring a lipid-based boundary (Strulson et al. 2012). Both ATPSs and coacervates also function as compartments in vitro (Williams et al. 2012; Strulson et al. 2012) and in the case of a dextran/PEG ATPS, within a phospholipid vesicle (Helfrich et al. 2002; Long et al. 2005). Coacervate droplets are particularly attractive due to the simplicity of their components, e.g. mononucleotides and small polypeptides, both of which could have been produced in a prebiotic environment (Leman et al. 2004; Powner et al. 2009).",

In a 25 % DEAE-dextran/25 % PEG (w/v) system (yielding \u2248 55 % DEAE-dextran-rich phase by volume), RNA partitioned strongly into the DEAE-dextran-rich phase due to the positive charge of the DEAE-dextran and the more polar nature of that phase; the degree of partitioning was so great that the RNA concentration in the PEG-rich phase was below our detection limit (Table S1). Conversely, in a 16 % dextran-sulfate/10 % PEG (w/v) system (\u224860 % dextran-sulfate-rich phase by volume), RNA partitioned strongly into the PEG-rich phase, presumably due to charge repulsion from the anionic dextran-sulfate. Droplets in the DEAE-dextran/PEG system coalesced more slowly than droplets in the dextran/PEG or dextran-sulfate/PEG system (Fig. S3), most likely due to the high viscosity of DEAE-dextran.

Ten minutes after photobleaching a sample, the external solution had fully recovered in fluorescence intensity due to the diffusion of RNA from adjacent non-bleached sample regions. However, the vesicles did not regain any detectable internal fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2, Movie S5). As expected, fatty acid vesicles, despite being more permeable to charged species than phospholipid vesicles, did not exhibit measurable permeability for RNA oligomers. The rate of RNA exchange across a fatty acid vesicle membrane was several orders of magnitude slower than the rate of RNA exchange across the boundaries of ATPS or coacervate droplets.

Although our FRAP measurements report only on the entry of RNA oligomers into ATPS or coacervate droplets, at steady state, the rate of efflux of RNA from droplets must equal the rate of influx. Our data therefore imply that RNA molecules do not remain localized within any droplet for longer than a period of seconds, and rapidly exchange between droplets via the surrounding bulk phase. Although a larger RNA such as a ribozyme would diffuse more slowly in solution due to its greater mass, our data indicates that longer RNAs will not reside in a droplet for a significantly longer time before diffusing out of the droplet. Fast RNA exchange coupled with the observed rapid coalescence of droplets suggests that ATPS and coacervate droplets would not confer the stable compartmentalization necessary for multiple generations of RNA selection and replication to occur, which would need to be on the order of many hours, if not days (Deck et al. 2011; Adamala and Szostak 2013b). If a given RNA molecule only resides in a particular droplet for a short period of time before exchanging into a different droplet, the products of any functional activity of that RNA (such as the catalytic production of a useful metabolite) would be spread across many droplets, and furthermore would not be heritable. In essence, the rapid exchange of RNA molecules between droplets is equivalent to a lack of compartmentalization in a time-averaged sense. Darwinian evolution requires compartmentalization so that mutations that improve function can lead to a selective advantage for the mutant genomic molecule. As the capacity for Darwinian evolution is a basic requirement for any protocell model, it is clear that unmodified ATPS and coacervate droplets are unsuitable protocell models.",

Many RNA affinity purification techniques rely on covalent attachments to a matrix such as sepharose (Allerson et al. 2003) or agarose beads (Caputi et al. 1999) and such a system could serve to slow RNA exchange. The coacervate system we studied was composed of a simple polypeptide (pLys) and a simple mononucleotide (ATP). RNA-protein (Lee et al. 1977; Drygin 1998; Baskerville and Bartel 2002) or RNA-nucleotide (Fl\u00fcgel and Wells 1972; Fl\u00fcgel et al. 1973) covalent interactions produced by photo-crosslinking could be good starting points to develop a system in which RNA becomes covalently linked to a matrix within coacervate droplets in a prebiotically plausible manner. Alternatively, utilizing a poly(Arg) matrix could result in tightly bound RNA that is unable to diffuse away from the droplet due to the electrostatic interactions between the arginine side-chains and the RNA backbone (Knight and Landweber 1998). Other immobilization techniques that take advantage of the ability of RNA to form base-pairs could also serve to slow RNA exchange.",

Focusing on the potential usefulness of these systems for sub-compartmentalization within protocells may be a productive direction for future research (Hyman and Brangwynne 2011). Fatty acid and phospholipid vesicle systems compatible with dextran/PEG ATPSs have been developed (Helfrich et al. 2002; Long et al. 2005; Dominak et al. 2010; this study), and it may be possible to develop similar vesicle systems that are compatible with the ATP/pLys coacervate system. This might be achieved by using net-neutral zwitterionic phospholipids or non-ionic amphiphiles as membrane forming molecules, as they would not interact strongly with the coacervate components, thus avoiding precipitation. Such a system would be similar to cellular organelle-based compartmentalization. In a prebiotic setting, a lipid-based membrane could encapsulate all components, and selective chemical partitioning into the two phases could provide an early protocell with the ability to partition compounds internally and accelerate reactions within the protocell, including for example the assembly of RNA complexes and ribozyme catalysis (Strulson et al. 2012). Thus, understanding how ATPSs and coacervates interact and combine with fatty acid and phospholipid vesicles may lead to a greater understanding of the possibilities for the development of early cells in an RNA world.",

All samples were prepared in 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes at room temperature. Due to the viscosity of the DEAE-dextran/PEG sample, pipet tips that were cut roughly 1 cm from the tip were used for that sample. To each sample, 5\u2032-6-FAM-labeled RNA (5\u2032- CCAGUCAGUCUACGC-3\u2032 or 5\u2032-CAUCUAGUUACCUCUAGGAUCUCAUGAUGCCUGAAGCGUAGACUGACUGG-3\u2032) from a 100 \u03bcM stock solution in nuclease-free water was added to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM RNA. Each solution was vortexed for 30 s. For applications that required the two phases to be separated, the sample tube was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Each phase was then pipetted into separate tubes. Transmittance measurements were performed using a GE Healthcare (formerly Amersham) Ultrospec 3,100 pro UV-Visible spectrometer (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). RNA phase-specific partitioning measurements were performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) Nanodrop 2000c Spectrophotometer. For confocal microscopy, DEAE-dextran/PEG and ATP/pLys samples also contained the GODCAT system (Glucose Oxidase-Catalase) to reduce photobleaching (Hentrich and Surrey 2010), and included 2 % w/v D-(+)-glucose, 0.5 mg/mL catalase, 1 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 143 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. A 6\u20138 \u03bcL droplet (6 \u03bcL for dextran/PEG, dextran-sulfate/PEG samples, and ATP/pLys samples, and 8 \u03bcL for DEAE-dextran/PEG samples) for each sample was applied to each glass slide (25x75mm) and a cover slip (18x18mm, No. 1) was applied. The slide was allowed to sit at room temperature until the droplet applied was completely spread across the entire cover slip area, and then the cover slip was sealed using Valap (1:1:1 vaseline, lanolin, paraffin wax) to avoid evaporation. Samples were covered with aluminum foil to reduce photobleaching by stray light until imaging.",

The solution was vigorously vortexed and visually inspected to verify that it contained only one phase. Subsequently, 3 \u03bcL of oleic acid were added to the solution and after another vigorous vortexing, the solution was tumbled over night on a rotating wheel (6 rpm) to allow vesicle formation. The next day, the vesicles were purified from unencapsulated dye and RNA using a short 1 cm Sepharose 4B gel filtration column and 1 mM oleic acid in 200 mM bicine (adjusted to pH 8.5 with NaOH) as a running buffer. 6 \u03bcL of gel-filtered vesicles were spread out (to around 1 cm2) on a 25x75 mm microscope slide and the droplet was allowed to evaporate for 6 min at room temperature.

Alternatively, a 3 \u03bcL droplet was placed on a slide and a coverslip was placed immediately on top of it. In this case, the coverslip was not sealed, but only fixed in the corners with Valap, and evaporation was allowed to occur through the edges over several hours.

After selection of the droplet to be analyzed, a time zero image was acquired, and then a circular or square region was photobleached at high power using an Argon laser at 488 nm (or a solid state laser for the Nikon system). Each photobleaching region was chosen to be as small as possible while still containing a single, whole droplet to minimize collateral photobleaching of neighboring droplets. The fluorescence intensity (either 493 nm to 543 nm on the Leica system, 505 nm to 530 nm on the Zeiss system, or 500 nm to 550 nm on the Nikon system) was then measured over time to track the fluorescence recovery of 5\u2032-6-FAM-labeled RNA molecules within the droplet of interest.",
