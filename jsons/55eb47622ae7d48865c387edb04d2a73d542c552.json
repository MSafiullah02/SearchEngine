A small short term increase in relative humidity even in the absence of transport of humid air from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal has been observed. The relative humidity levels were found to be exceeding the ambient levels during night and lying below the ambient levels during morning hours, indicating an increase in the survival rates of viruses responsible for the transmission of viral infections, as well as triggering immune-mediated illnesses such as asthma during Diwali.",

Also, the influence of meteorological parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity (RH) and mixing height on the distribution, dispersion and over all life time of atmospheric pollutants emitted during Diwali has been widely studied. However, except for Saha et al., 2014 , very little study has been reported on the possible causes for the observed changes in meteorological parameters during Diwali.",

At higher temperatures, air expands and can therefore hold more water vapour, resulting in a decrease in RH (Shaman and Kohn, 2009) . Although RH exhibits high natural variability throughout the year, any short term enhancement in humidity levels coupled with high level of pollutants during Diwali might prove to be fatal for a large number of elderly people and children with respiratory ailments. Therefore the influence of pollutants emitted during Diwali on meteorological parameters such as air temperature and relative humidity (RH) and in turn the effect of short term change in environmental parameters on the survival of viruses responsible for the transmission of viral infections such as common cold, as well as triggering immune-mediated illnesses such as asthma has been examined in this paper over a period of 13 years at three cities in India namely; Ahmedabad, New Delhi and Kolkata.",

The ignition of fireworks can be explained by the reaction 6KNO 3 \u00feC 7 H 4 O\u00fe 2S-K 2 CO 3 \u00feK 2 SO 4 \u00feK 2 S\u00fe4CO 2 \u00fe2CO\u00fe 2H 2 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jastp O \u00fe3N 2, in which CO 2 and H 2 O are produced as end products. The heat emitted by the ignition of fireworks excites the electrons in the metal atom to higher energy levels. These excited states are unstable, so the electron quickly returns to its ground state, emitting excess energy as light (Khaiwal et al., 2003) . A significant proportion of this emitted light has a wavelength below 240 nm (Attri et al., 2001; Reader and Corliss; 1982-83) . The radiative energy of these emissions is sufficient to dissociate organic molecules (molecules containing C, H and O) present in the air, enabling the reaction",

Airborne infection involves the production of an infectious organism in one host to its transmission to a secondary host. Tang (2009) has observed that environmental exposure is a common hazard for these infectious organisms during their journey between hosts as temperature, humidity and sunlight (ultraviolet light) can act to inactivate these free-floating organisms. As temperature affects the state of viral proteins (including enzymes) and the virus genome (RNA or DNA), virus survival decreases with increase in temperature.",

Generally, viruses with lipid envelopes (respiratory viruses such as influenza, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses) tend to survive longer at 20-30% RH (Harper, 1961; Schaffer et al., 1976; Ijaz et al., 1985) . Conversely, non-lipid enveloped viruses (such as respiratory adenoviruses and rhinoviruses) tend to survive longer at 70-90% RH (Karim et al., 1985; Arundel et al., 1986; Cox, 1989 Cox, , 1998 . Although the findings from all studies are not consistent, there seems to be some general indication that minimal survival for both lipid enveloped and non-lipid-enveloped viruses occurs at an intermediate RH of 40-70% (Arundel et al., 1986; Tang, 2009) .

New Delhi (28.57\u00b0N; 77.12\u00b0E), the capital of India, lies on the flood plains of the river Yamuna on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It covers an area of 1484 km 2 and has a population of around 27 million residents. It is a densely populated, cosmopolitan city and has one of the highest living standards in India. Diwali or Deepawali, also known as the \"Festival of Lights\" is one of the oldest, and most popular cultural and religious festival, which is celebrated throughout India every year during October/November with fervour and gaiety. In north India (New Delhi), Diwali signifies Lord Ram's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana and his coronation as king; in Gujarat (Ahmedabad), Diwali signifies worship of goddess Lakshmi and marks the beginning of New Year, while in West Bengal (Kolkata), it is associated with the worship of goddess Kali. The celebrations include lighting of lamps, candles and bursting of fireworks. The festive fever starts a few days prior to Diwali with people igniting fireworks, shopping for the celebrations and visiting each other and reaches a crescendo on the day of Diwali.",

Similarly, the daily maximum temperature (\u00b0C) was averaged over the entire month to represent the background (normal) temperature, while the maximum temperature (\u00b0C) on the Diwali day was used to represent the effect of Diwali. Further, the diurnal variation of RH before and after Diwali (72 days to 77 days) were averaged and compared with the averaged diurnal variation of RH a day prior to, on the Diwali day and a day after Diwali for any abnormal variations in RH levels at these three cities.",

The years during which the back trajectories indicated transport of humid air from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal (such as the years , 2004 , 2006 , 2008 and 2010 the years 2006 and 2011 at New Delhi and the years 2003 , 2004 at Kolkata) have been omitted from this study as these humid air parcels might be responsible for the observed high RH levels.

One such back trajectory at each of these three cities is presented as an example in Fig. 2 .

The sulphate and suspended particulate matter released into the atmosphere during the ignition of fireworks contribute to the high levels of SO 2 and PM 10 (\u03bcg/m 3 ) observed during Diwali compared to the background levels (Fig. 3) . It is further observed from Fig. 4 , that the SO 2 and PM 10 levels are high during the years 2007, 2010 and 2012 under study at New Delhi. The observed short term increase in RH may be because, these sulphate and suspended particulate matter reduce solar irradiation from reaching the earth's surface thereby reducing the earth's surface temperature and increasing relative humidity.",

However it was observed that the RH levels during Diwali was 89% (higher than the background level by around 15%) at midnight (00:00 h IST), continued to increase thereafter, reaching a maximum of 94% around 02:00-06:00 h IST decreased sharply thereafter to 51% around 17:00 in the evening and increased thereafter to 94% at night. Similar diurnal pattern of RH was observed during Diwali for the years 2000, 2003, 2004, [2007] [2008] [2009] [2010] [2011] , although the magnitude of difference between background and Diwali RH levels varied from one year to another. The RH levels continued to remain high till morning hours at all stations for all years because the hydrocarbons released into the air by enhanced traffic continued to react with molecular oxygen in presence of the UV radiations emitted from the firecrackers and weak sunlight to produce water vapour to its maximum potential. The local noontime surface UV Irradiance at 305 nm, 310 nm, 324 nm and 380 nm averaged over these three cities (Fig. 7) indicates that although the surface UV Irradiance during Diwali (8 Nov., 9 Nov., and 10 Nov., 2007) is low (by 13.04%, 9.09%, 3.83% and 3.25% less respectively compared to the background levels), it does not differ significantly from the background levels. This indicates that the chemistry of NO x -VOC is active during Diwali noon time. Therefore, as the day progressed, photo-chemical production of ozone through the standard OH-CO-NO and NO x -CO-HC reactions (Crutzen, 1974) , resulted in a decrease in RH levels. This is validated by the observations of Attri et al. (2001) that during the festival period the ozone concentration peaked at around noon The RH levels at Ahmedabad, New Delhi and Kolkata were found to be exceeding the ambient RH levels (40-70%) during night, while the RH level at Ahmedabad was found to be lower than the ambient RH level during morning hours (Fig. 6) , indicating an increase in the survival rates of viruses responsible for the transmission of viral infections, as well as triggering immunemediated illnesses such as asthma during Diwali. The percentage of cases involving respiratory disorders reported during Diwali out of total number of cases reported during the entire year at Government Civil Hospital, Sola in Ahmedabad is shown in Fig. 8 . The sudden spurt in respiratory infection cases reported during Diwali may be a possible consequence of an increase in the survival rates of viruses responsible for the transmission of viral infections due to change in temperature and RH levels.",

It is concluded that the toxic pollutants emitted due to the ignition of fire works during Diwali are not only fatal for a large number of elderly people and children with respiratory ailments who inhale the polluted air directly, but they also influence the meteorological parameters such as temperature and relative humidity, which in turn control the survival rate of viruses responsible for the transmission of viral infections resulting in a sudden spike in respiratory infection cases reported during Diwali. However, as the causes of outbreaks of viral infections are quite complex and do not have a simple relationship with change in temperature or RH; it is difficult to differentiate the magnitude of respiratory ailments caused directly by inhaling the pollutants from that caused indirectly by increase in survival rate of viruses due to change in temperature and RH.",
