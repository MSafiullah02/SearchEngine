Here, we develop a method for estimating such extrinsic and intrinsic factors from a single series of event-occurrence times. The analysis is performed using a model that combines the inhomogeneous Poisson process and the Hawkes process, which represent exogenous fluctuations and endogenous chain-reaction mechanisms, respectively. The model is fit to a given dataset by minimizing the free energy, for which statistical physics and a path-integral method are utilized. Because the process of event occurrence is stochastic, parameter estimation is inevitably accompanied by errors, and it can ultimately occur that exogenous and endogenous factors cannot be captured even with the best estimator. We obtained four regimes categorized according to whether respective factors are detected. By applying the analytical method to real time series of debate in a social-networking service, we have observed that the estimated exogenous and endogenous factors are close to the first comments and the follow-up comments, respectively. This method is general and applicable to a variety of data, and we have provided an application program, by which anyone can analyze any series of event times.",

Generally, event occurrence is subject not only to such intrinsic self-excitation mechanisms, but also environmental changes that take place independently of events that have occurred in a system. For instance, contagious diseases may spread from one individual to another, but the occurrence rate may also be subject to environmental factors such as temperature change [24] . When considering how to facilitate or attenuate occurrence activity, we need to know the potential contributions of endogenous and exogenous factors [25] [26] [27] . When the government reviews possible intervention in the economy, it must be able to project the degree of the uncontrollable chain reaction causing economic fluctuations such as falling stock prices, and hopefully to calculate the possible impact of external intervention.",

The estimation errors can be assessed by applying the decoder to synthetic data generated by simulating the inhomogeneous Hawkes process and comparing the estimated and original parameters. It may occur that exogenous fluctuation and/or endogenous self-excitation are not captured, even by a Hawkes decoder that can represent the original process. Using a path-integral method, we construct phase diagrams in which the results are categorized into four qualitatively different regimes according to whether or not their respective factors are detected. Then, we apply the Hawkes decoder to a time series of debate in a social-networking service (SNS) to estimate the relative contributions of exogenous and endogenous factors. We also examine the model's capability of predicting the amount of follow-up comments induced by first comments in the SNS. We also provide an application program, by which anyone can analyze any sequence of event times.",

To do this, we estimated the reproduction ratio \u03b1 and the timescale of the self-excitation kernel \u03c4 s by fitting the Hawkes decoder to the data of the preceding one week. With the series of events generated by this procedure, we constructed a time histogram of the occurrence rate with a bin size of 30 min. By repeating this procedure 1,000 times for the same \u03bd(t), we obtained 1,000 different time histograms, with which we can obtain the distribution of the number of comments. Figure 7 (c) depicts two examples of commenting activity for 1 week, with the distribution of occurrence rates \u03bb(t) predicted from the first comments. The rate of all comments that have occurred in practice is plotted on the distribution, exhibiting good predictive performance.",
