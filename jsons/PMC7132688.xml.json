The following terms were utilized as key word searches: infection control, infection prevention, hospital, readiness, disaster plan, mass casualties, bioterrorism, pandemic, and emergency management. Only English language articles in peer-reviewed journals were utilized. An Internet search was also conducted in December 2008 using the same search terms as above to identify existing book chapters, reports from response agencies, published standards and guidelines, and other relevant materials related to the development of hospital emergency management plans to address biologic MCEs that were outside the peer-reviewed literature. Inclusion criteria included articles, planning documents, and published reports that addressed infection prevention issues that need to be included in a Plan. Articles that address community, public health, or personal preparedness were excluded. Also excluded were articles that only addressed noninfection prevention emergency management issues, such as developing policies and procedures for incorporating National Incident Management System (NIMS) terminology into the hospital emergency management plan. US- and non-US-based articles and documents/reports were included in the analysis.",

One aspect of surge capacity is assessing on-hand resources and calculating how much might be needed during an MCE. For biologic MCEs, this could include the need for equipment and supplies that would last up to 8 weeks (the estimated wave of a pandemic). These estimates should also take into account that other health care facilities will be placing strains on the supply system during this period and may not be able to meet normal supply needs. Examples of resources that need to be assessed include intravenous pumps, ventilators, anti-infective therapy, vaccination, diagnostic testing materials, linens, respiratory protection, gowns, gloves, eye protection, hand hygiene products, laboratory supplies, isolation rooms/areas, and morgue beds. The need for extra hospital personnel will likely be greater during a biologic MCE compared with other disasters because staff may be less willing or able to work during a biologic event.10, 11 Some factors that may influence health care workers' willingness and ability to work during a biologic MCE include personal illness or quarantine, family obligations, and fear of exposure or illness.10, 11 In addition, worker fatigue may be greater during a biologic MCE because of wearing PPE for extended periods of time or because of psychologic stress.

For example, most national organizations recommend stockpiling of anti-infective therapy, vaccines, and personal protective equipment, but guidelines for how much of a stockpile are needed have not been developed. Researchers agree that surge capacity is needed for all types of mass casualty events, but the exact amount/number of surge beds that need to be available for any given facility has not been outlined.11, 16, 18 The number of airborne infection isolation rooms or negative-pressure surge capacity needed by a hospital and the most effective indicators for syndromic surveillance have also not yet been determined. Most researchers state that biologic scenarios should be used in hospital disaster exercises to evaluate hospital preparedness, and the Joint Commission requires hosting disaster exercises at least twice a year,9 but the frequency with which biologic scenarios must be used in these drills has not been established. Indicators for hospital emergency management preparedness vary by the researcher8, 10, 14, 15 and by the organization.3, 5, 11, 16, 17 Until some of these research questions are answered, IPs and their hospital emergency management planning committees are left on their own to determine what is best for their facility given their resources and limitations.
