Despite the sustained efforts from the community, most approaches ignore the psychological relevance of temporal characteristics of suicidal behaviour. Moreover, there has been limited explorations in the space of homophily networks to identify collusive depressive users. We hypothesize that the contextual information embedded in social media engagement and historical activities of users can lead to substantial improvements in automated identification of suicidal ideation. We look beyond linguistic cues into temporal signals throughout this work, with the help of a publicly available dataset given by [14] of 34,306 tweets on suicidality detection.",

[1] tried to link users' psychological features such as personality traits including personalities, sentiment and emotion for cyberbulling and trolling.

Temporal GCN provides a substantial gain over text in prediction confidence due to the user interactions. Additionally, it is interesting to observe the ability of the GCN model to better represent historical suicidal signals in comparison to naive historical and textual features to a sufficient degree. Empirically, temporal features help suppress false positives induced by text classifiers that try to overfit on the presence of anecdotal suicidal phrases such as \"kill me...hahaha !! \" that may be considered as noise in non-suicidal text. The most optimal weights for temporal signal modeling Text + Builtup + Episodic + Surprise were derived to be 0.52, 0.04, 0.04 and 0.32 through cross-validation experiments. Figure 1 elucidates the impact of including psychological contextual cues on a small sample of connected users from the test dataset. It is evident from the historic trends of Users B and C that they follow a nearly episodic nature with scattered surprises. Analysing the trend plots for Users A and D reveals an inverse build-up thereby demonstrating that there can be either a positive or negative build-up in the suicidal intent of users. All these aspects when captured by our model has led to a statistically significant increase in the model's performance.",
