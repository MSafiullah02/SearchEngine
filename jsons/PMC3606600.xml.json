The 2009 pandemic thus highlighted a further factor which must be considered when determining which public health intervention strategies to recommend, namely the severity of symptoms arising from a given emergent influenza strain. The mild symptoms of H1N1 2009 resulted in a reluctance of public health authorities to use rigorous social distancing interventions due to their disruptive effects, even though modelling has previously suggested that they could be highly effective in reducing the illness attack rate [4-13].",

Comparing simulations with and without interventions in place allowed us to analyse the effect which a range of interventions have on reducing the attack rate and on the health of each individual in the modelled community. Epidemic outcome data produced by the simulation model were used to determine health outcomes involving hospitalisation, ICU treatment, and death. In turn, these healthcare outcomes, together with productivity losses due to removal from the workforce, were used to estimate the overall cost of interventions. Figure 1 provides an overview of this analysis methodology, showing each of the processes that make up the methodology, their input parameters and the resulting data generated by the process.",

The community is also of a size where public health interventions could be uniformly implemented based on local information. The model captures explicit person-to-person contact with the contact network describing population mobility occurring between households, schools, workplaces and the wider community as shown in Figure 2. The virus spreads through the community due to this mobility, as transmission occurs between individuals when they are co-located, possibly following a move from one location to another. For example, an infectious child moves from household to school on a given day, and infects two further children; they return to households 2 and 3 and, following virus incubation, become infectious and may infect other household members in their households. Note that these households may be geographically separate, but are connected via contact of children at school.",

The simulation algorithm captures the state of the whole population twice per day, a daytime point-in-time snapshot and an evening snapshot, with individuals (possibly) moving locations between successive day or night periods, such as household to school or workplace for the day phase, returning to home for the night period. Individuals come into contact with other individuals on a one-to-one basis in each location, with possible influenza transmission then occurring. Individuals in each household and contact hub make contacts within a close-contact mixing group, taken to be the entire household or a subset of larger hubs, and also make additional non hub-based random community contacts.

The infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals was also assumed to be 0.5 and this applies to all infected individuals after the latent period but before onset of symptoms. The infection profile of a symptomatic individual was assumed to last for 6 days as follows: a 0.5 day latent period (with Inf(Ii) set to 0) was followed by 1 day asymptomatic and infectious, where Inf(Ii) is set to 0.5; then 2 days at peak infectiousness (with Inf(Ii) set to 1.0); followed by 2.5 days reduced infectiousness (with Inf(Ii)set to 0.5). For an infected but asymptomatic individual the whole infectious period (of 5.5 days) was at the reduced level of infectiousness with Inf(Ii) set to 0.5. This infectivity profile is a simplification of the infectivity distribution found in a study of viral shedding [30]. As reported below in the results section for the unmitigated no intervention scenario, these assumptions regarding the duration of latent and infectious periods lead to a mean generation time (serial interval) of 2.47 days which is consistent with that estimated for H1N1 2009 influenza [26,31,32].",

When no antiviral intervention was administrated the values of both AVEi and AVEs were assumed to be 0, indicating no reduction in infectiousness or susceptibility. However, when antiviral treatment was being applied to the infectious individual the value of AVEi was set at 0.66, capturing a reduction in infectiousness by a factor of 66% [35]. Similarly, when the susceptible individual was undergoing antiviral prophylaxis the value of AVEs was set to 0.85 indicating a reduction in susceptibility by a factor of 85% [35]. This estimate is higher than most previous modelling studies [6,36,37], which assume an AVEs of 30%. This common assumption appears to stem from an estimate made in [38] based on 1998\u20131999 trial data. Our higher value is based on a more comprehensive estimation process reported in [35], which also incorporated data from an additional study performed in 2000\u20132001 [39].

Note that these school closure policies were only activated after the community-wide diagnosed case threshold was reached; cases occurring in schools before this time did not result in school closure.

Similarly Sander et al. found that the addition of continuous school closure to an extended antiviral strategy also increased total costs, including pandemics with a 5% CFR. In contrast, we found that adding continuous school closure to an extended prophylaxis strategy reduced total costs where the CFR was 0.25% or greater (i.e. category 2 and above), for a pandemic with R0 = 1.8.",

Like the other two studies mentioned above, the study of Smith et al. did not include future productivity losses due to death.

In the likely situation where the severity of an emerging pandemic is initially unknown (but is suspected to be greater than that of seasonal influenza), the results indicate that the most appropriate intervention strategy is to instigate school closure and community contact reduction, combined with antiviral drug treatment and household prophylaxis, as soon as transmission has been confirmed in the community. If severity is determined to be low, public health authorities may consider relaxing social distancing measures. In the case of a category 1 pandemic (CFR approximately 0.1%), little is lost by the early imposition and subsequent relaxation of social distancing interventions: results indicate that even if schools are closed for 8 weeks while severity is being determined, the total cost of the pandemic is lower than if no interventions had been enacted. If severity is determined to be high, extending the duration of social distancing interventions results in both net savings to society and reduction in mortality.",
