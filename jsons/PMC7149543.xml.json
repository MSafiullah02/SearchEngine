            "text": "Globally, 80% of wastewater is discharged untreated into the world's waterways (Opec, 2018). Failure to treat effluents constitutes a serious threat to the environment, the climate, and human health, but this can also be considered a waste of resources. According to the goals of sustainable development and a circular economy, the wastewater shall be considered primarily as a source of water, then energy, organics, metals, and other resources. Consequently, sewage sludge is recognized as a source of renewable energy and material recovery (Christodoulou and Stamatelatou, 2016). Thus, no longer considered a \u201cwaste,\u201d it became a byproduct to be posttreated in order to be recycled into nature as energy, matter, or both. Sewage sludge is a reservoir of organic matter and nutrients, so it constitutes a potential substrate for a variety of possible reuse scenarios. Therefore, all potentially applied strategies shall fulfill the requirements of ecoinnovation. Thus, they shall lead to an important reduction of the negative environmental impacts by decreasing the consumption of natural resources or the release of harmful substances (Rorat and Kacprzak, 2017). Consequently, contemporary trends in organic waste treatment follow the sustainable development strategy in terms of environmental, economic, and social impacts. The composition of sewage sludge is highly variable and may depend on many various factors such as the seasons, the technology applied in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the specificity of the source area of the influent, etc. On average, dewatered sewage sludge contains 50%\u201370% organic matter and 30%\u201350% mineral components (including 1%\u20134% of inorganic carbon), 3.4%\u20134.0% nitrogen (N), 0.5%\u20132.5% phosphorus (P), and significant amounts of other nutrients, including micronutrients that could be recovered. For instance, extractable resources such as phosphorus (P) are predicted to become scarce or exhausted in the next 50\u2013100 years, thus P recovery from wastewater is becoming an increasingly viable alternative (Connor et al., 2017). Nevertheless, a relatively low content of lignin and cellulose makes the organic matter easy to decompose. Hence, it degrades fast and can cause a sharp peak in the nitrate and pollutant concentration in the soil if applied without pretreatment. The biggest challenge, though, is seen in the contaminants, (1) organic (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), adsorbable organohalogens (AOX), pesticides, surfactants, hormones, pharmaceuticals) and (2) inorganic (metals and their nanoparticles), and (3) pathogenic species of living organisms for example, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic helminths (see review by Fijalkowski et al., 2017).",

After thickening, sludge stabilization is usually performed. It is crucial for the further applications and aims primarily to reduce the potential risks by lowering the number of pathogens in organic matters. Two types of stabilization of liquid sewage sludge shall be distinguished:1)Chemical stabilization by the addition of lime to alter the value of the pH to > 11; eliminates the microbiological risk.2)Biological stabilization, meaning anaerobic or aerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion is a process of treating the secondary sludge from the biological wastewater treatment process as activated sludge or trickling filters; anaerobic digestion can be conducted in low (< 10%) as well as medium (15%\u201320%) and high 22%\u201340% solid anaerobic digestion systems; this technology is described in detail in the next section.\n",

            "text": "At first recognized mainly as a process of the stabilization of sewage sludge with the main aim of pathogen bacteria removal, now anaerobic digestion (AD) is often considered as a technically mature and cost-effective process that converts sludge into biogas (Cao and Paw\u0142owski, 2012). The produced biogas can be used for the self-purposes of WWTPs that are characterized by a high demand for electricity, up to 0.78 kWh per m3 of treated wastewater (Cano et al., 2015). Ideally, the process of anaerobic digestion shall fulfill this high demand. In order to increase efficiency and thus biogas yields, it was proposed to introduce the other ingredients in the so-called codigestion. For instance, Grosser (2018) used grease trap sludge and an organic fraction of municipal waste as cosubstrates in the process, which enhanced the efficiency of sewage sludge anaerobic digestion. Similarly, other organic wastes have been tested with success, for example, food waste, cheese whey, and olive mill wastewater (Maragkaki et al., 2018). Thus, codigestion of sewage sludge can be understood as a method of management of different organic wastes. Nevertheless, it cannot be fully seen as a final disposal of sludge, as it generates another byproduct, digested sludge (digestate), that still contains a high quantity of nutrients and contaminants and must be treated. It was proven that the utilization of digestates may replace or reduce the use of mineral fertilizer in agronomic plant production, as it is rich in plant-available nutrients (ammonium, phosphate, and potassium) (Sogn et al., 2018). Yet, in-land use as a biofertilizer is possible only if the product can be qualified according to applicable norms, usually regulated by soil protection legislation, fertilizer, or waste legislation. Otherwise, other options shall be considered. Lately, Peng et al. (2018) proposed using the digestate in landfill bioreactors in order to remove the nitrogen of old landfill leachate. Digestate was also successfully applied with other organic wastes as the organic fraction of municipal wastes, sawdust, and green wastes in the process of vermicomposting (Rorat et al., 2017). As the chemical composition of digestate corresponds to the composition of the used substrates, the long-term effects of its introduction to the soil shall be studied in order to appreciate the impact on soil functions (soil biodiversity and microbial cycles). The existing studies focus mainly on the fertilizer properties of the digestates produced from different substrates. According to Nkoa (2014), the most common risks associated with the application of digestate in land are related to:a)Risks of atmospheric pollution (ammonia emission and fallout, nitrous oxide emission).b)Risks of nutrient pollution (excess nitrogen and phosphorus).c)Risk of soil contamination (chemical/biological contamination).\n",

            "text": "Composting as a method of biological decomposition of biowastes in the presence of oxygen contributes powerfully to the recycling and conservation of several macro- and micronutrients from sewage sludge in the soil. Its alternative, vermicomposting, is a modern, inexpensive, and eco-friendly biotechnology in which earthworms are employed as natural bioreactors in order to decompose the organic matter (Suleiman et al., 2017). Their metabolic activity and cooperation with microorganisms lead to a 40%\u201360% reduction of volume, an increase of bioavailability of nutrients to plants, a reduction in the C/N ratio, and a decrease of the availability of some dangerous contaminants such as metals (Rorat et al., 2015). Although composting can be considered highly beneficial and a low cost sewage-to-matter strategy that allows recycling organic nutrients into the ecosystem, it still causes some important problems from an environmental point of view. Due to the rapid degradation of nitrogenous organic matter, important nitrogen losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be noted (S\u00e1nchez-Monedero et al., 2010). Those effects can be partially reduced by the introduction of different bulking agents, for example, agricultural wastes and alkaline amendments such as lime, zeolite, and bentonite. Recently, biochar has also been considered an efficient agent causing a reduction of greenhouse gases, ammonia, and extractable ammonia emissions (Mali\u0144ska et al., 2014; Awasthi et al., 2016). Although these effects can be partially eliminated, researchers are concerned about the input of potentially toxic metal elements and therefore their possible accumulation for several in the soil horizon (Fang et al., 2017). The same type of risk is related to the presence of other chemical compounds and pharmaceuticals as well as some pathogens that can survive the process.",

Generally, the most famous technologies are incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, and plasma gasification. Combustion and/or incineration are considered the most attractive disposal methods for sewage sludge in Europe (EC, 2008), as they replace potentially dangerous landfilling and agricultural strategies. This also allows largely reducing the volume of sewage sludge to destroy the microbiological danger, minimize the odors, and simultaneously recover the renewable energy. Three main variants of this process are used: incineration in dedicated plants, coincineration with municipal solid wastes, and incineration in cement kilns. The environmental cost related to those systems is mostly related to the high energy consumption and production of harmful gaseous emissions (i.e., dioxins and furans) (Garrido-Baserba et al., 2015). Moreover, the ashes coming from the process can be considered a concentrated pollutant that accumulates chemical contaminants. The interesting alternative for ash disposal is a cement replacement. After incineration, sewage sludge is still rich in silica, alumina, calcium oxide, and iron oxide, so it can be used in the production of building materials. Moreover, in this form, metals are stabilized and solidified, so the potential risk is reduced (Samolada and Zabaniotou, 2014).",

Basically, the process converts the organic matter into bioenergy (oil/gas) with a byproduct in the form of so-called biochar. Thus, pyrolysis allows yielding a major bio-oil fraction potentially useful as a fuel or as a source of chemical products. Generally, pyrolysis and similar processes of combustion of sewage sludge are regarded as endothermic. Nevertheless, Atienza-Mart\u00ednez et al. (2018) have shown lately that the necessity of pretreatment of this substrate (dehydration) moves it more to the exothermic processes, although it is still the most cost-consuming throughout the scenario. Thus, improvement of the steps allowing water removal is crucial for the future potential of the process. Independently, numerous studies have shown many advantages of using biochar for environmental management. For instance, it can be applied for soil improvement, to improve the efficiency of the resources, for remediation and/or protection of lands, and future greenhouse gas mitigation (Joseph and Lehmann, 2015). In general, biochar can thus be defined as a solid, carbon-rich material obtained in the process of zero or low oxygen pyrolysis from different C-based feedstocks, which, applied to the soils, sustainably sequesters carbon and thus improves soil quality in the long term (Verheijen et al., 2010).",

Moreover, Fri\u0161t\u00e1k and Soja (2015) recognized that the addition of biochar produced from wood chips and garden residues into the sewage sludge and its application as soil amendments have increased the content of available forms of phosphorus. The positive effects of the addition of sewage sludge-derived biochar were also observed during the process of vermicomposting of sewage sludge, where it significantly reduced the bioavailability of Cd and Zn for Eisenia fetida earthworms (Mali\u0144ska et al., 2017).",

Concerns relate to potential trophic transfers (via cultivated plants) and possible contamination of groundwater. PTE is a common general term that includes metal elements, formerly known as \u201cheavy metals\u201d or \u201cmetal trace elements.\u201d They are naturally present in soils and the current concerns come more from anthropogenic soil contamination by these elements through the use of fertilizers (including sludge, slurries, and manures), pesticides, and poor waste management. They classically comprise the following metals and metalloids: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn). Potential environmental risks associated with these PTEs in the context of sludge land applications have been extensively studied and environmental guidelines and regulations defined. For several OCs, such a regulatory framework exists as for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and several persistent organic pollutants (POPs, such as PCBs, dioxins, and related compounds (PCDD/F)). The list and limit values for concentrations of metal elements and OCs that should restrict the use of sewage sludge in agriculture have been updated recently in Europe (EC, 2000). They have suggested the regulation of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS; extensively used as surfactants), Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NP(E)), halogenated organic compounds (i.e., adsorbable organic halides (AOX)), PAH, PCBs, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzo-furans (PCDD/F). Studies on sludge contaminants started in the 1970s. Most of the chemicals we use in our everyday lives and those with industrial applications are likely to end their lifecycle in biosolids, not to mention byproducts of human activities. We could only exclude highly volatile products and those that are rapidly degraded. In addition to the OCs in urban wastewaters, surface run-off of atmospheric-deposited environmental contaminants onto artificialized areas (concreted and paved, consequently impervious) contribute to the accumulation in sewage sludge of lipophilic compounds that tend to adsorb to solid particles. This situation is like that of sediments in aquatic ecosystems. It is the nonpolar and some persistent compounds that could represent an environmental risk with sludge recycling. One of the most concrete examples may be that of surfactants such as LAS (little worrying, even considering present uses but above all realized risk assessments, (Schowanek et al., 2007)) and more worrisome fluorosurfactants such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (Smith, 2009).",

In 1996, Wilson et al. (1996) proposed a list of 300 products to prioritize in sludge research work and surveys (priority organic pollutants on environmental agency and country lists and compounds identified in sludge worldwide). This number is close to the one (332) from (Drescher-Kaden et al., 1992) on toxic or suspected toxic OC residues in German sludge, based on a review of the literature on more than 900 articles. Harrison et al. (2006) reported 516 OCs for which concentration data were available in the peer-reviewed literature and official government reports. More recently, Eriksson et al. (2008) concluded after a literature review that 541 OCs could potentially be present in sewage sludge due to their use in construction materials, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products. However, some OC concentrations are not sufficiently characterized in such matrices as sludge and biosolids because their analyses are confined on regulated or identified contaminants on priority lists that represent only a small fraction of the present OCs (Harrison et al., 2006). These authors highlight the lack of knowledge for OCs as nitrosamines with high environmental risks while the knowledge is more comprehensive for some families such as pesticides, PAHs, and PCBs. Thus, a global vision of the contaminants present in the sludge is possible for some as metals, PCB, PAH ... Besides, the concentrations for these compounds in sludge tend to decrease. As an illustration of sludge contaminations around the world, we propose Table 2, Table 3\n. Such an overall worldwide inventory could also be made for PCBs and PCDD/Fs, but it would not be possible for most other TrOCs.",

Others pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Serratia, Enterobacter, or Proteus have also been identified (Korzeniewska, 2011). All these bacteria may cause various infections such as urinary tract infections (E. coli), pneumonia (Klebsiella and Enterobacter), blood infections (Enterobacteriaceae), and gastrointestinal infections (E. coli, Salmonella).

            "text": "Legislative pressure forces all countries to respect the common waste management hierarchy with prevention, reuse, recycling, and recovery the most preferable pathways while landfilling and disposal should be strictly limited (Rorat and Kacprzak, 2017). Authorities, communities, wastewater industries should therefore apply environmental assessments as decision-making tools, in addition to the economic and technical evaluation of each proposed solution. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool that allows quantifying the environmental impact/cost of particular options for management of sewage sludge in order to choose the best suitable option for each stakeholder. The result of an LCA shall be understood to be an environmental profile of total and single lifecycle stages considering the use of resources, human health, and ecologic consequences; it does not show any economic or social factors (Cherubini et al., 2009). For instance, the impacts related to wastewater treatment could concern mainly: (1) energy consumption at different stages (global warming), (2) the presence of PTEs (toxicity) and (3) the content of chemical oxygen demand (COD), N and P (eutrophication) (Feijoo et al., 2018). In the case of sewage sludge, most studies examine environmental aspects related to sludge application through fuel requirements (transport on agricultural land), introduction of metals into soils, the reduced use of mineral fertilizers, greenhouse gas emissions, carbon storage, and nutrient leaching (Yoshida et al., 2013). Generally, land application is a contributor to global warming, eutrophication, and acidification while toxicity was considered to be related to the presence of Zn and Cu, according to (Yoshida et al., 2018). Lundin et al. (2004) have compared four different options for final disposal of sewage sludge: agricultural application, coincineration with waste, incineration combined with phosphorus recovery, and fractionation with phosphorus recovery. In most aspects, the agricultural land disposal was recognized as the least preferable from an environmental point of view while other options have good potential of sustainability. Lately, Turunen et al. (2018) have developed a multiattribute value theory (MAVT)-based decision support tool (DST) in order to supply the simple scoring method to count the environmental risks of particular scenarios. The constructed value tree helped to select pyrolysis above the other tested alternatives of composting and incineration.",
