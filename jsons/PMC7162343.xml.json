After the often\u2010frenetic medical interventions prior to a patient's death, \u201cthe autopsy pathologist represents a slowing down of thinking, which is exactly what it should be,\u201d Dr. Wiles says. However, the specter of a public health threat could speed up that timeline and spur a limited autopsy protocol that more quickly tests for the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens.",

Liron Pantanowitz, MD, professor of pathology and biomedical informatics and director of cytopathology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Shadyside Hospital in Pennsylvania, doubts whether cytopathologists will play a meaningful role. \u201cMost of the pathogens are viruses that, unfortunately, don't declare themselves with pathognomonic cytologic fi ndings,\u201d he says.",

Around the world, he adds, cytopathologists are likely to encounter more abscesses as bacterial infections stop responding to standard therapies.",

For example, after the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak in Toronto, a postmortem tissue examination of 20 patients documented a diffuse alveolar damage pattern associated with lung injury, as well as signs of an aspergillosis fungal infection in the lungs of 2 patients.1\n",

When researchers realized the PCP pathology was linked to HIV in many cases, she says, they reviewed other PCP\u2010related cases and found signs of the virus. \u201cSo, those cases of PCP helped resolve other unexplained events in the past,\u201d Dr. Auger says.\n\n",

Dr. Koenig has developed some of these protocols for frontline responders and hospital personnel, including a triage screening approach she calls \u201cvital sign zero.\u201d2 Before assessing a patient's traditional vital signs, she says, the approach asks providers to pause and ask whether the scene has been secured from the threat of passing on an infectious disease. Beyond asking symptomatic patients to use specifi c entrances, the preparations could involve donning personal protective equipment and establishing isolation zones around patients believed to be contagious.",

If you're seeing something unusual, then law enforcement would need to be alerted too. For example, we should never see a smallpox patient.\u201d",

However, vaccine development takes time and money, and requires a more sustainable investment than typically is available. \u201cWe have funding at the federal level that can be activated after certain types of disasters, such as hurricanes or earthquakes. But we don't really have a good pot of money that's set aside for the emerging infectious disease scenario,\u201d Dr. Koenig says. Being more prepared, she says, may mean adopting an \u201call\u2010hazard\u201d approach that promotes education, training, and consistent funding to help the medical community respond to next big threat, whatever it is and wherever it emerges.",
