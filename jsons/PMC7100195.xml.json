Almost all taxes collected in these countries, as well as international loans granted by the International Monetary Fund under strict conditions, are used to postpone paying off debts acquired in the past in less good times, often under non-democratic and corrupt governments. Debt increases because of abusive interest rates imposed unilaterally by the international financial community.

Approximately US$1.8 trillion of speculative, non-productive capital is currently in circulation in the world (5). This capital has no nation and, therefore, no responsibility for people or to countries. The world must control it both nationally and internationally to diminish its pernicious effects, both globally and locally. John Williamson, an economist, coined the expression \u2018\u2018Washington Consensus\u2019\u2019 to name the set of recommendations for Latin America regarding economic reforms. These define the conceptual basis of the globalization process as we understand it today. Despite his previous positions Williamson now recognizes, in his recent book, the imperative to control capital flow in the so-called emerging markets (6).",

European Union per capita military expenditures are US$358.00 and the per capita expenditures on foreign aid US$61.
