By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the datafitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the fourphase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.",

Coronaviruses can cause illnesses that range from the common cold to much more severe illnesses like SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19. 2 The outbreak of COVID-19 originated from the four admitted patients with pneumonia who had been working in Wuhan Huanan seafood wholesale market, doing business in live poultry, aquatic products, and some wild animals. The now-closed market being a common factor in infections encouraged the belief that the infection may be linked with certain animals. The species that harbored the SARS-CoV-2 was probably bat, containing 96% identical at the whole-genome level. 4 The COVID-19 may include signs of fever, cough, shortness of breath and general breathing difficulties, organ failures or even death, posing a severe threat to the whole society. The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on 30 January 2020. 5 The global epidemic seemed to be spreading at an alarming rate, causing 79 824 accumulative laboratory-confirmed infections with 2870 deaths as of 29 February 2020 in China 6 and 6009 outside China, 7 so it deserved priority attention and intensive research. Chinese health authorities stated that it was likely to transmit from person to person even before any actual signs appeared, which made it especially difficult to prevent and control. 8 However, Chinese government have attached extremely great importance and taken a range of prompt public health measures in response to the epidemic, starting by the strict exit screening measures in Wuhan on 23 January and followed by extensive medical support in Wuhan, individual going out under protective equipment (masks), school postponement, cancellation of mass gatherings, spontaneous isolated population, and so on.",

R 0 value is usually applied to reflect the potential and severity of infectious diseases. The larger R 0 is, the stronger the transmission power will be. If R 0 is less than 1, it means that the disease will gradually die out. 14 Despite all of the results of the nCoV, the epidemic kept in a constant state of change, especially after the rigorous measures have been taken by Chinese government, so it calls for more comprehensive research such as updated R 0 estimates, more appropriate index under the circumstances of intervention such as effective reproductive number (R), methodological improvements, and effect evaluation of control measures to reflect the dynamic and progress of it.

The model simulation was based on the hypotheses: (a) the whole population was susceptible; (b) unprotected contact between the susceptible and the infectious would lead to infection; (c) the susceptible and the infectious were homogenous in the population; (d) the epidemic originated from one single case; (e) no intervention was taken in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic; (f) the patient would be quarantined in the hospital once confirmed; and (g) deterministic dynamic model was employed.

The result showed that decreased frequency of exposure (K) was associated with slower rate of decline in susceptible population and slower rate of increase in infected population, indicating the possible effectiveness of intervention measures. The parameters that could have impact on the model result contained frequency of exposure (k), probability of infection per exposure ( 0 \u03b2 ), and average recovery time (T i ). Frequency of exposure (k) could be controlled by isolation; infection per exposure ( 0 \u03b2 ) could be adjusted by wearing protective suit and average recovery time (T i ) could be shortened by the treatment strategy. To specify the most sensitive factors in intervention, we also conducted sensitivity analysis, proving that the change of T i had stronger impact on the infected population than quarantine and protective measures, so it was urgent to explore effective treatment options. After the epidemic outbreak, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research to screen out clinical drugs and develop vaccines. The treatment plan at this stage focused on antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, symptomatic treatment of",

In this way, we established the link between R and R 0 according to the reported case data and analyzed the trend by Dickey-Fuller Test, which showed a rise from 20 to 30 January, a decline from 31 January to 11 February, a short rebound on 12 February and another continuous decline from 13 to 29 February.The rise was partly due to the onset after incubation period.The rebound was caused by inducing clinical diagnosis in the fourth phase of government measures.

In contrast to a single R 0 , we attempted to take into account the dynamic changes of R values on different scenarios of the epidemic. This study also established the link between R values and the effect of government measures. Besides, we adopted sensitivity analysis to identify the most effective factor in containing the epidemic. In addition, the estimate of transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 was calculated by simulation followed by data fitting, which could be helpful in enhancing the accuracy and precision of the prediction.

The actual number of infected patients was not exactly the same as the reported cases on that day, and there may be some missing reports and undetected cases. Since the actual number of infected and suspected patients was not observable, there must be some unavoidable discrepancy between the confirmed patients and actual number of infection, which lead to the inevitable deviation of the estimation. Though we adopted the model in the addition of latency, it did not account for the infectiousness during incubation period, so it may reduce the accuracy as a consequence. The travel of people flow between different regions was not well considered, especially the migration after the Spring Festival-back to work and back to school. Sensitivity analysis suggested that effective drug therapy could have great influence on the intervention result, it would have been more comprehensive if the study could have included the effect of antiviral treatment.
