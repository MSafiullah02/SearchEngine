His medications included an antihypertensive medication and a proton-pump inhibitor. He was a lifelong non-smoker and worked as a dentist. He had no family history of ILD. His physical exam was significant for dry inspiratory crackles at both bases and normal resting oxygen saturation. His pulmonary function was abnormal with a forced vital capacity of 57% predicted and a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of 67% predicted.

Although most patients with IPF experience a steady decline in lung function over time, some will decline quickly, while others seem stable for many years. Increasingly, we recognize that some patients may also have a more unpredictable course [2] . These patients experience periods of relative stability followed by acute episodes of worsening in their respiratory status [3] . Episodes of acute respiratory decline in IPF can be secondary to complications such as infection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or heart failure [3, 4] . Such episodes of acute respiratory deterioration have been termed AEx of IPF when the cause for the acute worsening cannot be identified. Acute exacerbations likely comprise almost 50% of these acute respiratory events, and the clinical characteristics and prognosis are indistinguishable from acute exacerbations of known cause. This chapter will focus on AEx of IPF.",

Other risk factors associated with an increased risk for the development of AEx include higher body mass index [15] and younger age [18] .

            "text": "Infection has also been suggested as a cause of AEx of IPF. Data in support of this hypothesis include animal studies [43] as well as some human studies [44, 45] . In one case series, 75.7% of 37 AEx cases occurred between December and May [24] , lending further support to occult infection as a cause of AEx. However, in a prospective study of AEx of IPF (n = 47), acute viral infection, as determined by the most current genomics-based methodologies, was found in only 9% of this cohort [46] . While some cases may well have been missed (i.e., the virus had come and gone by the time testing was obtained), these data suggest that there are many cases of AEx that are not primarily due to occult viral infection. More recently, there are data describing a difference in the microbiome of IPF patients who are experiencing an AEx compared to stable patients. In a study of 20 AEx and 14 stable IPF patients matched for age, sex, smoking history, and baseline lung function, BAL bacterial burden was increased in AEx patients compared to stable patients [47] .",

Other definitions that have been described are generally similar; however, they often include a reduction in PaO 2 as one of their criteria as well as bilateral chest x-ray abnormalities (instead of a HRCT scan) [6, 75] . While the IPFNet criteria have helped to standardize the definition of AEx of IPF, satisfaction of all criteria was quite difficult to achieve in many clinical settings. In addition, there was increasing evidence to suggest that the constraints of an \"idiopathic\" label and a set time interval of 30 days were unnecessarily restrictive and arbitrary. As a result, a new, international working group came together to propose a new conceptual framework for acute respiratory deterioration in IPF [76] .

As with any set of criteria, fundamental assumptions made in the development of criteria, whether it is for clinical or research purposes, should be reassessed periodically in order to incorporate the emerging data and knowledge in the field. This reassessment of the diagnostic criteria for AEx of IPF simplifies the requirement to exclude certain triggers of respiratory deterioration, such as aspiration and infection. Instead, it recognizes that distinguishing between triggered and so-called idiopathic acute exacerbations of IPF has little clinical or biological support. The hope is that these criteria will provide an improved framework for studying the etiology, pathobiology, and clinical management of AEx of IPF.

In a retrospective analysis of the placebo arms of the three IPFNet studies, patients who were on antiacid therapy had a lower incidence (0%) of AEx of IPF compared to those who were not on antiacid therapy (8%) during the trial period [77] . Some novel therapies have suggested a reduction in AEx in clinical trials; these include warfarin [78] , pirfenidone [79] , and nintedanib [11] . Unfortunately, both warfarin and pirfenidone have subsequently been shown to have no impact on the rate of AEx, suggesting that the initial observations may be inaccurate [80, 81] . The two follow-up and parallel phase-3 clinical trials using nintedanib had mixed results in regard to prevention of AEx [10] . Interestingly, a secondary data analysis from three IPF clinical trials suggested that pirfenidone was associated with a lower risk of respiratory-related hospitalization compared to placebo, but not allcause or non-respiratory-related hospitalization [82] . In addition, those hospitalized for any reason had lower risk of death if they were on pirfenidone. While these events were not specific for AEx of IPF, these data suggest that pirfenidone may have an impact on the risk and severity of respiratory deterioration, including AEx, in IPF.",

Perhaps we should be more critical of the use of corticosteroids to treat AEx of IPF. There are two distinct viewpoints regarding the role of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF. The first viewpoint is that AEx of IPF is histopathologically similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by DAD and acute lung injury [84] and should, therefore, be treated similarly to ARDS. In the ARDS literature, the mortality benefit of corticosteroids is unclear [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . In one study, increased mortality was observed in ARDS patients treated with delayed corticosteroids (after 14 days) [90] . If we were to follow the ARDS paradigm, most clinicians would not use corticosteroids in the treatment of AEx of IPF. A second viewpoint for the role of corticosteroids in IPF is that some patients with AEx of IPF have organizing pneumonia on biopsy [74] . Organizing pneumonia is generally thought to be steroid responsive, and it may be that the pathobiology is different enough between ARDS and AEx of IPF to warrant continued use of corticosteroids. There remains equipoise on the efficacy of corticosteroids in AEx of IPF, and this treatment intervention should be studied more carefully [66] .",

Supportive care for respiratory failure almost always requires higher oxygen supplementation and consideration of additional means of ventilatory support including mechanical ventilation (see discussion below) and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Yokoyama et al. described the outcomes of patients with AEx of IPF treated with NIPPV to avoid intubation in acute respiratory failure [94] . In this retrospective case series of 11 patients, 6 patients failed a NIPPV trial and subsequently succumbed to respiratory failure. The other five patients survived more than 3 months after the onset of their AEx. However, the use of ventilatory support in AEx (both mechanical ventilation and NIPPV) has never been studied in a randomized controlled trial.",

We propose that the prevention and treatment of AEx of IPF must focus on both disease-specific (e.g., anti-fibrotic therapies) and nondisease-specific (e.g., vaccination, prevention of stress) areas. The next decade will hopefully answer many of the unresolved questions concerning AEx of IPF.",
