Although the affected areas appear to be non-focal, these areas might behave like non-recruitable collapsed lung tissue. This finding might have implications for the way these patients are ventilated.",

Within the personalised group, patients with focal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) received low PEEP with prone positioning, and patients with non-focal ARDS received recruitment manoeuvres and high PEEP. There was no difference between the control group and the personalised group in 90-day mortality, the primary endpoint of the study. However, misclassification of patients as having focal or non-focal ARDS was observed in as many as 85 (21%) of 400 patients. In subgroup analyses, an alarmingly higher mortality was found in patients who were misclassified with focal ARDS than in patients who were correctly classified with focal ARDS.",

Thus, the difference between focal and non-focal ARDS might be a matter of recruitability rather than morphology.",
