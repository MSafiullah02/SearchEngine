Because virus has unique biological characteristics and pathogenesis, there are no effective treatment methods for viral diseases [2]. The virus disease has become one of the most serious threatens to human or animal health. Vaccination is the most common preventive method, but some infectious diseases are still difficult to control because the efficacies of some vaccines are severely decreased when a virus circulation does not have a good match with vaccine strains due to antigenic drift or inaccurate epidemiological predictions [3], or some vaccines with inferior quality, improper conservation and transportation problems [4]. A few chemical drugs have been used, but their clinical effects are not satisfied and there are obvious negative effects such as drug residues, drug tolerance, high recurrence rate, environmental pollution and so on [5]. Therefore, it becomes so urgent to study and develop new-type antiviral drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity, which will be an important topic to many scholars [6].",

Some CHMs or their extracts such as astragalus polysaccharides injection, extract of indigowoad root have been developed into antibacterial and antiviral agents [8]. On one hand, CHMs possess many biological activities, such as adjusting immunologic function, inhibiting viral processes (adsorption, transcription, replication and release) and so on, which showed reliable biological functions with little side effects and low toxicity. On the other hand, many researches demonstrated that CHMs possess many antiviral active materials. And many active materials had not been discovered yet [9]. Moreover, new virus or strains of virus emerge continually. So, antiviral compound screened from CHMs became a hotspot for many investigators.",

Up to now, the control of this disease is mainly by vaccination of ND vaccine. Although the strict immune program has been taken in the farms, the disease is still hard to control. Though some Chinese veterinary herbal medical preparations, such as injection of honeysuckle flower-baical skullcap root-forsythia suspense, and injection of astragalus polysaccharides have become one of principal weapons in veterinary clinical therapy and play an important role in clinical epidemic prevention. But these preparations have not displayed satisfactory clinical effects on this disease.

In present experiment, the antiviral effects of nine flavone ingredients prescriptions based on the above-mentioned four flavones ingredients were compared by determination of the effect on cellular infectivity of NDV. Then 3 better prescriptions were chosen and their protective effects of ND by artificial challenge were observed. The purpose of this experiment is to observe the antiviral action of these flavone ingredients prescriptions, search for optimal combination of flavone ingredients, select out the best prescription and offer theoretical evidences for development of new-type antiviral drugs.",

All groups were keeping at 37  \u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator. When the NDV control group appeared obviously cytopathic effect (72 h), the CEF livingness was measured by the MTT colorimetric assay [15]. 30 \u03bcL of MTT was added into each well, re-incubated for another 4 h. The plates were centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed carefully and 100 \u03bcL of DMSO was added into each well to dissolve the formazan crystals [16], [17]. The plates were shaken for 5 min to dissolve the crystals completely. The cellular optical absorbance at a wave length of 570 nm (A570 value) in each well was measured by microliter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Model RT-6000, Leidu Bioscience Corporation, Shenzhen City). The virus inhibitory rate was calculated based on the formula [18]: Virus inhibitory rate = (\u0100\ndrug+virus\n \u2212 \n\u0100\nvirus\ncontrol)/(\u0100\ncell\ncontrol\n \u2212 \n\u0100\nvirus\ncontrol) \u00d7 100%. In order to compare antiviral activity among different ingredients easily, especially between signal flavones and prescriptions, the score based on virus inhibitory rate was analyzed. Drug with the highest virus inhibitory rate was scored 13 (13 kinds drugs in all), next 12, analogized one by one, the lowest scored 1, and then the score was ranked. The A570 values and virus inhibitory rate and the score were considered as the indicator of antiviral activity.",

In three drug-adding modes, the prescriptions of EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF, EF-BSRF and EF-WDFF-BSRF presented at the top five of the highest virus inhibitory rate. Furthermore, their total scores located the highest three of the score rank. Moreover, the A570 values of prescriptions of EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF (pre-, post-, simultaneous-adding), EF-BSRF (pre-, simultaneous-adding) and EF-WDFF-BSRF (post-, simultaneous-adding) were not only significantly larger than those of the corresponding virus control group (p\n < 0.05), but also significantly larger than those of the corresponding cell control group (p\n < 0.05). These results suggested that the prescriptions of EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF, EF-BSRF and EF-WDFF-BSRF possessed the best antiviral effect to inhibit the cellular infectivity of NDV in vitro than the other prescriptions and flavone ingredients. Thus, the three prescriptions of EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF, EF-BSRF and EF-WDFF-BSRF were chosen as the objective medicines in the vivo experiment.",

Humoral immunity mediated by B lymphocytes is one of the main factors to resist infectious diseases as an important specific immune response. The peripheral antibody level in poultry is the marker reflecting humoral immune function in bird species [21], and plays an important role in the host's defense against infectious diseases. If the antibody titer is higher, the infection degree of chicken to NDV will be less serious [22]. The results of immune protection test showed that on days 14, 21 and 28 after the first vaccination and day 12 after challenge (D\n40), the antibody titers in three flavone prescriptions groups, especially in ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF group were significantly higher than those in VC group and BC group. This confirmed that the three flavone prescriptions could accelerate the antibody production in vaccinated and challenged chickens, the efficacy of ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF was stronger than those of the other two prescriptions. The results were consistent with that of antiviral effect of prescriptions in vitro, which confirmed that three flavone prescriptions, especially ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF had the best efficacy in enhancing humoral immunity thus improving the immune effect of ND vaccine.",

The result showed that in ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF group, the mortality and mortality were the lowest; the protective rate was the highest, which proved that ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF possessed best immunity protective effect from infection of ND, and the results in vitro and in vivo were consistent.",

EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF possessed the highest virus inhibitory rate in nine prescriptions, just 150%. The highest virus inhibitory rate of WDFF-BSRF was lower than any other, which indicated that there was a mutual inhibition between WDFF and BSRF.

It also demonstrated that anti-NDV modes of Chinese herbal flavone ingredients and their prescriptions were multi-link. Yan and Tan [24] also confirmed that the antiviral effects of Chinese herbal flavone ingredients were related to directly killing virus, inhibiting the procedures of virus replication, or activating and strengthening the immunity. Therefore, they could exert antiviral efficacy in different ways. Generally speaking, it is complicated mechanisms between the compatibility of the traditional Chinese herbal medicine and its bioactivities (synergistic effect or mutual inhibition), which needs further study. Compatibility Theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription is valuable reference for this purpose.",
