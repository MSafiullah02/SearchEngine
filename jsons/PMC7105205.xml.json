These pathways are highly coordinated and regulated to ensure proper localization and allocation of proteins, cell wall components, and other vital materials for proper growth and development (Roberts, 1994; Miller et al., 1997; F\u00fcrthauer and Gonz\u00e1lez-Gait\u00e1n, 2009).",

Tip growth requires high levels of tip-focused endomembrane trafficking to deposit lipids, proteins, and cell wall materials to facilitate rapid growth (Hepler et al., 2001). Pollen tubes must form an elongating tube that travels from the surface of the stigma to deliver the sperm to the ovule (Lord, 2000). This rapid tip growth is facilitated by the coordination of the actin cytoskeleton and a highly active secretory system (Hepler et al., 2001).",

            "text": "Within the Ras superfamily of proteins, the Rab family of small GTPases is evolutionarily conserved and regulates the budding, transport, and fusion of vesicles from intracellular donor compartments to target compartments, thus mediating intracellular trafficking (Stenmark and Olkkonen, 2001; Nielsen et al., 2008; Ebine et al., 2011). When bound to GDP, RABs are inactive; however, when bound to GTP, they are activated and interact with downstream effector proteins (Stenmark and Olkkonen, 2001). Although many RAB proteins are found in yeast, plants, and mammals, of the three, RAB2 is found only in mammals and plants (Rutherford and Moore, 2002). The Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog RAB B1 and the mammalian RAB2 are involved with vesicle maturation of the anterograde trafficking pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi stacks and localizes primarily in the Golgi (Rutherford and Moore, 2002). In Nicotiana tobaccum (tobacco), RAB2 is found predominantly in pollen grains, pollen tubes, and root hairs, probably due to the high secretory demands of the two cell types. Transcripts are detected in floral buds and lateral roots, though this might be due to their presence in pollen and root hairs (Cheung et al., 2002). When fused to GFP, RAB2 is observed in Golgi stacks that are highly active within the germinating pollen grain as well as the elongating tube (Cheung et al., 2002). This localization can be exploited to study endomembrane trafficking in a developing pollen tube. Because the ER and Golgi are major components along the secretory pathway, it can be inferred that, if agents such as bioactive small molecules perturb this pathway, global secretion will be significantly impaired, allowing the effect of the small molecules to be identified by microscopy.",

Since endomembrane trafficking is a physical phenomenon that can be observed by microscopy, it can be quantified and subjected to statistical analysis. Indeed, our ability to quantify distribution, sizes, and rates of endomembrane compartments in many organisms and tissue types has been growing over the past two decades (Pyke and Leech, 1991; Derksen et al., 1995; Logan et al., 2003; Rink et al., 2005; Pochynyuk et al., 2007; Ketelaar et al., 2008; Sparkes et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2010; Collinet et al., 2010; Salomon et al., 2010). Earlier studies used various methods to quantify trafficking that were limited by the available technology. Initial investigations utilized transmission electron microscopy and manual measurement of organelles. This was used to infer growth rates based on mathematical models (Ketelaar et al., 2008) or by calculating organelle distribution (Derksen et al., 1995). Although informative, these studies observed frozen or fixed tissue rather than live cells, which provide a more accurate depiction of cellular processes.",

Live imaging in combination with image analysis gave a more comprehensive description of organelle size and distribution (Pochynyuk et al., 2007). Nevertheless, these approaches used still frame images\u2014snapshots in time that omit any temporal dynamics. To account for this, video data can capture movements and morphological changes of cellular compartments in real time while simultaneously measuring several features in animal cells (Collinet et al., 2010) and endomembrane trafficking in plant pathogen-infected leaf epidermal cells (Salomon et al., 2010). To visualize and quantify video images from cells displaying rapid growth and highly dynamic trafficking, we used germinating pollen as a model system. Our present study combines quantitative video analysis with bioactive chemicals to rapidly and controllably perturb trafficking, permitting the quantitative and comparative description of compounds affecting intracellular trafficking in pollen grains.",

            "text": "There are several challenges to be overcome in understanding endomembrane trafficking in the sporophyte and gametophyte. Classical genetic approaches are limited by functional gene redundancy because mutation of a single gene can result in a lack of phenotype due to compensation. Alternatively, when an essential gene is mutated, embryo lethality can result. These obstacles can be circumvented by a chemical genomics approach that uses small molecules to temporarily modulate protein function. Small molecules often bind to proteins, transiently inhibiting proper function. This marriage of synthetic chemistry and biology coupled with the grand scale of genomics is a powerful approach that produces large amounts of useful phenotypic data prior to genetics (Hicks and Raikhel, 2012). However, the powers of chemical biology and genetics are both limited by an inability to accurately quantify trafficking processes to obtain objective descriptors to compare the dynamics in the presence of different inhibitors or mutations. For example, due to the high-throughput nature of chemical screening, data analysis should be quantitative and automatable to accommodate large image data sets.",

Because of their rapid growth and ease at which vesicle movement is visualized, Nicotiana tobaccum (tobacco) pollen was an ideal model system in which to perform this screen. Compounds were screened for those that inhibited germination or altered tube morphology, both of which are dependent upon proper tip-focused vesicle trafficking. In a developing pollen tube, vesicle traffic follows a distinct reverse fountain flow in which cargo moves towards the growing tip on the sides of the tube and cargo moving from the tip moves down the center of the tube (Pierson and Cresti, 1992). Several small molecules were found that disrupted this distinct trafficking pattern.",

A small molecule was considered to be bioactive if pollen grains did not germinate or there were defects in tube morphology such as isodiametric tip growth. In this current study, the 360 compounds were serially diluted to 25\u201350 and 10\u201320 \u00b5M, depending on the molecular weight of the compound, to determine the minimal effective concentrations and to uncover possible latent phenotypes (Figure 1\n).

Compared to untreated controls, disruptions in the localization of RAB2:GFP were manifested as agglomerations (Figure 3\n) which we termed \u2018RAB2 bodies\u2019. The bodies were presumed to be derived from Golgi stacks and ER. RAEs 6 and 7 elicited similar phenotypes, suggesting a similar mode of action and structure. Structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) analysis indicated that both RAEs 6 and 7 have a nitro group along with a nitrile group next to a double bond.

RAEs 1, 2, and 5 could be targeting proteins that have a minor role in regulating the localization of RAB2:GFP and therefore only cause a minor defect, whereas RAEs 6, 7, and 8 may be targeting proteins that play a major role in regulation of RAB2:GFP localization and endomembrane trafficking, thereby causing a dramatic defect. Alternatively, RAEs 1, 2, and 5 may effect trafficking via reversible target binding, whereas RAEs 6, 7, and 8 could bind irreversibly to their target(s), resulting in stronger phenotypes.",

            "text": "Interestingly, RAEs 6 and 7, two of the more potent compounds, have a nitrile and nitro group in common. The nitrile group can undergo a nucleophilic reaction that is facilitated by the nitro group to irreversibly bind with proteins (Beck, 1978; Habibi et al., 2012). Likewise, RAE 8 contains a functional group containing N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM is a Michael acceptor, which adds nucleophiles such as the thiols in cysteine residues and is a commonly used cysteine modifier (Crankshaw and Grant, 2001) which could lead to irreversible target binding. This could very well be the case with RAE8. In fact, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor adaptor protein receptors (SNAREs) are, by definition, sensitive to NEM, suggesting that the target of RAE 8 might conceivably be a specific SNARE (S\u00f6llner et al., 1993). Because RAE 8 is predicted to be an irreversible inhibitor, Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) would be a promising approach for target identification. However, it is beyond our scope to develop an image analysis approach to quantify endomembrane dynamics. Although it is intriguing to consider the reversibility and targets of RAEs, this is beyond our goal of developing a technically robust video-imaging tool to quantify trafficking.",

This method has the ability to streamline chemical genetic screens and aid in experimental design. It is important to note that other automatic or semi-automatic image acquisition modalities can be used as well as freely available image analysis software. When analyzing data, the limitations of scale are determined by the resolution of the image and the frame rate at which the video data were collected, not necessarily the image analysis software. One advantage of our approach to classifying small molecules is the difference score. This will help facilitate the classification of compounds into meaningful clusters based on bioactivity as a quantitative measure of vesicle dynamics (Drakakaki et al., 2011). Though each feature value was given equal weight, one could increase the weight of any given feature, tailoring this score to any application. However, the difference index can only take into account phenotypes that can be quantified and the number of features measured determines the usefulness and flexibility. In addition, the score is highly dependent on the control phenotype and can only describe changes in preexisting conditions. It is not helpful in describing new phenotypes that were not represented in the control condition.",
