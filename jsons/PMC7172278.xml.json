            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a large, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome approximately 28 kb in size, and is taxonomically classified as a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae [1,2]. PEDV has been recognized in veterinary medicine since the early 1970s in Europe and subsequently identified in many other swine-breeding regions of the world [3]. PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality in nursing piglets [4]. PED outbreaks have been reported in many swine-raising countries, including Europe and Asia [[5], [6], [7]]. With the widespread use of inactivated or attenuated bivalent vaccines for PEDV in China, the nationwide spread of PED was controlled until 2010; however, since December 2010, there has been a remarkable increase (>50%) in PED observed on many pig farms in China [8]. A high morbidity rate of between 90% and 100% among neonatal piglets was observed, with a mortality rate of 70%\u2013100% on affected pig farms, resulting in a huge economic loss in the pig farming industry [9,10]. In 2013, PED emerged in swine in the USA [11] and spread rapidly across the country, resulting in the substantial economic losses. And then, one PEDV strain called the S INDEL was identified by sequence analyses in US swine in 2014, which had insertions and deletions (INDEL) in the spike gene and formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster compared to U.S. PEDV prototype strains [12,13], and has also been detected in South Korea, Germany, Belgium, France, Portugal, Japan, Italy and Austria [14,15].",

Prior to 2016, only two types of PCVs were known to infect pigs around the world: PCV1 and PCV2 [17]. Although PCV1 is non-pathogenic to pigs, PCV2 is pathogenic and has been associated with a number of diseases affecting pigs worldwide [18,19]. In 2016, a novel PCV, called PCV3, was identified in the USA using metagenomic sequencing technology and a genetic evolution analysis [20]. Subsequently, PCV3 was reported to be widely distributed throughtout China in commercial pig farms from 14 provinces [[21], [22], [23], [24]]. Recently, PCV3 was confirmed in Poland, South Korea, Brazil, Italy, and the UK [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29]], indicating that PCV3 is spreading globally. Moreover, previous studies have detected PCV3 in samples obtained from piglets with diarrhea [[30], [31], [32]], suggesting that PCV3 may have a potential association with swine diarrhea.",

Twenty-nine of 66 samples were positive for PEDV via duplex qPCR, 11 samples were positive for PCV3, and 18 samples were positive for both PEDV and PCV3, which were in accordance with those of the single qPCR assay (Table 2\n). The singular infection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 43.94% (29/66) and 16.67% (11/66), respectively, and the co-infection rate of PEDV and PCV3 was 27.27% (18/66). The detection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 71.21% (47/66) and 43.94% (29/66), which are similar to those of Zhou's PEDV qPCR method or Chen's PCV3 qPCR method, respectively. Besides, the singular infection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 42.42% (28/66) and 15.15% (10/66) using conventional PCR, respectively, and the rate of PEDV and PCV3 co-infection was 24.24% (16/66). The detection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 66.67% (44/66) and 39.39% (26/66). These results demonstrated that duplex qPCR is applicable for the differential diagnosis of PEDV and PCV3 in field samples, with high sensitivity and specificity.",

            "text": "Since the late 1980s, PED has existed throughout China, resulting in huge economic losses to the pig industry [8,43]. As a novel swine virus, PCV3 was reported to be widely circulating throughout the USA, China, South Korea, Poland, Brazil, Italy, and the UK. Previous studies have shown that PCV3 may be linked to diseased pigs with PDNS, reproductive failure, cardiac and multi-systemic inflammation, skin diseases, and porcine respiratory disease complex [20,22,44,45]. However, two additional studies have detected PCV3 in samples obtained from piglets affected with diarrhea. Wang et al. reported that out of 145 archived tissue samples collected from diseased pigs with diarrhea, PMWS, reproductive disorders, respiratory disorders, and PDNS for the detection of PCV3, the PCV3 DNA detection rate was 60.87% (28/46), 20% (12/60), 10% (2/20), 0% (0/16), and 66.67% (2/3), respectively [30]. Moreover, the results showed that the PCV3 detection rate in diarrhea samples was higher than that in the other sample types. Another study analyzed 35 diarrheal weaned pig samples and 35 non-diarrheal weaned pig samples for the presence of PCV3, and found that the rate of PCV3 positivity in the diarrheal samples was 17.14% (6/35), significantly higher than that of the non-diarrhea samples (2.86%, 1/35) [31]. These findings suggest that PCV3 may have a potential association with diarrhea. According to these findings, it is likely that a single PCV3 infection or PEDV and PCV3 co-infection could cause diarrhea in pig populations; however, the virus has not been isolated from these populations and studies investigating pathogenesis using the isolated virus have not been conducted. Thus, a rapid and reliable diagnostic assay is required for the simultaneous detection of PEDV and PCV3 in clinical samples for epidemiological and clinical studies, as well as the development of effective control strategies for PEDV and PCV3 infections.",

Similarly, immunohistochemical detection, PCR, and qPCR have all been developed for the detection of PCV3 [20,33,34,37]. However, ELISAs and immunohistochemistry are time-consuming techniques with a relatively low specificity and sensitivity. Thus, they cannot be used to estimate the amount of viral DNA/cDNA copies, which can be an important factor for viral diagnosis via correlations with viremia or clinical signs. On the other hand, qPCR has been widely used as a diagnostic method for its apparent advantages over conventional PCR due to its high sensitivity and specificity, allowing for high-throughput screening and the quantification of viral loads using small volumes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a SYBR Green I-based duplex qPCR assay for the simultaneous detection of PEDV and PCV3.",

In this study, the 163-bp PEDV ORF1 gene or 136-bp PCV3 rep gene was successfully amplified using the single qPCR assay with PEDV- or PCV3-specific primers. Furthermore, the duplex qPCR assay with two sets of PEDV- and PCV3-specific primers simultaneously detected PEDV and PCV3 DNA in a single reaction tube, with similar sensitivity to the corresponding single qPCR assay (Fig. 2). The LOD of the duplex qPCR assay was 34.6 copies/\u03bcL for PEDV, which is comparable to those of previously reported qPCR assays [35,54]. The LOD of the duplex qPCR assay was 61.2 copies/\u03bcL for PCV3, which is a little higher than that of previously reported Taqman-based qPCR assays [37,55]. These data were 100 times more sensitive than those of conventional PCR. These results indicate the duplex qPCR assay had good sensitivity to detect PEDV and PCV3 in clinical samples.",

In this study, the total DNA and RNA were extracted from clinical samples using a commercially available kit (Beijing Zoman Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). For a sample infected with DNA virus and RNA virus, the conventional nucleic acid extraction method is usually to extract separately, which is time-consuming. In this method, virus genome DNA/RNA nucleic acid extraction kit can be used to extract virus DNA and RNA from samples at the same time, and save time on the basis of cost saving. However, the efficiency of this kit extract RNA and DNA simultaneously may slightly affect the sensitivity of the assay. The nucleic acid content is a little lower than that of separate extraction, but it does not affect the amplification. In this study, we found the sensitivity of PCV3 amplification increased by approximately 1\u20133 Cq value, whereas the sensitivity of PEDV amplification was not different compared with conventional fluorescence quantitative PCR. Chumakov studies suggest that in the reverse transcriptase stage, reverse transcriptase can lead to the production of primer dimers, which may be the result of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity [56]. The reason may be that DNA nucleic acid participates in the first 45 \u00b0C 5 min reaction in one-step duplex reaction procedure, which reduces the activity of some DNA. However, the positive rate can be determined by melting peak. Although there was no dimer in two-step RT-PCR, the two-step method must be avoided in clinical virus detection, because it not only increases the workload and prolongs the detection time, but also greatly increases the probability of cross-contamination. Anyhow, the establishment of this method can provide a reference for the establishment of multiple DNA and RNA methods for other pathogens.",

In contrast, some samples that were negative for PEDV or PCV3 using the conventional PCR assay were found to be positive with the qPCR assay. Furthermore, these samples that were positive for PEDV or PCV3 in the qPCR assay but negative in the conventional PCR assay were confirmed to be positive by DNA sequencing. These results suggest that the conventional PCR assay does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect PEDV or PCV3 in samples with low viral loads, whereas the duplex qPCR assay is better suited to detect low levels of virus and perform a quantitative analysis of the viral load. In addition, the detection rates using duplex qPCR were 71.21% (47/66) for PEDV, which is in accordance with previous studies that reported detection rates of 61.10%\u201378.49% in China [8]. In this study, the PEDV primers target a 163bp sequence in ORF1. Since coronaviruses generate a set of subgenomic RNAs (coding structural and accessory genes) during the replication in the cells, the sensitivity of this assay may be lower than assays targeting other viral genes, such as M and N protein. However, in this study the positivity of PEDV was confirmed in clinical samples using a published method (by Zhou et al.), and the detection rate for PEDV was similar to that of Zhou's PEDV qPCR method. The result suggested that compared with M or N genes, primers designed in ORF1 region may affect the sensitivity of the test, but PEDV primers designed in highly conservative region will not have a significant impact on the positive rate of clinical samples. Moreover, the detection rate for PCV3 using duplex qPCR was 43.94% (29/66), lower than that reported in diarrheal samples by Wang et al. [30], but higher than that reported in diarrheal weaned pigs by Zhai et al. [31]. This further supports the high sensitivity and specificity of duplex qPCR, and its applicability for the differential diagnosis of PEDV and PCV3 in field samples. This showed that the newly developed duplex qPCR assay for clinical diagnosis has a significant advantage, as PEDV and PCV3 can be amplified simultaneously in a single reaction mixture. Again, it is efficient, simple, quick to detect PEDV and PCV3 nucleic acid, and reduces the cost of diagnosis.",

At present, many suspected cases of DNA virus and RNA virus mixed infection or RNA viruses mixed infection often appear in clinical samples. When it is uncertain which virus is causing the infection, one-step method can be used to diagnose the infection or both simultaneously, so as to achieve the dual purpose of diagnosis and differentiation. In addition, compared with conventional methods, this method is faster and more convenient, and can generally complete the whole detection process, and the results were consistent with those by using a single method, which showed that the stability of the method was better. The model can be extended to the differential diagnosis of other mixed infections with viruses, which has a positive significance in promoting the application of multiple technologies in veterinary medicine.",

In the present study, PCV3 and PEDV nucleic acids were detected in intestinal tissue and fecal samples of piglets suffering from diarrhea using duplex qPCR. These results demonstrated that both singular and co-infections with PEDV and PCV3 exist in the pig population in China. These findings suggest that PCV3 might have a potentially pathogenic association with diarrhea at the tested pig farms; however, there is not enough data to directly confirm that PEDV and PCV3 are relevant in the context of swine diarrhea. Thus, further investigations should be conducted to ascertain the role of PCV3 in pigs affected with diarrhea and monitor the epidemic status of PCV3.",
