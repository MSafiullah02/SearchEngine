The rationale for the research objective was derived from Nooteboom [19, 20] and Tornatzky and Klein\u2019s [21] work on SMMEs underpinned by Roger\u2019s diffusion of innovations theory [22]. Building on the diffusion of innovation theory [22], Nooteboom [19, 20] identified the first stage of the SMME adoption process as awareness; adequate knowledge about the innovation to be adopted. While awareness is generally a given for large firms and technology-oriented SMMEs, it is a key barrier for technology-following and non-technological SMMEs with regard to readiness for adoption [19, 20, 23].",

Firstly, the findings suggest that smart manufacturing research on SMMEs is limited in low-income countries and also not contextualized to context specific demands such as sector and or industry specific challenges and preconditions. These includes smart manufacturing technology applications and how they relate or can be applied in SMME context. Secondly, the findings suggest that the issues of SMME awareness, relative advantage and complexity of smart manufacturing DT innovation have received very little research attention. This is critical for readiness/adoption in relation to technology-following SMMEs [20]. Lastly, SMME characteristics (lack of skills, expertise and resources) are incompatible with smart manufacturing. This renders technology-following SMMEs not ready for the adoption of smart manufacturing.",
