A total of n=12,817 responses were considered valid with responses from 12 featured countries and five WHO regions. Female gender, pre-existing psychiatric condition, and prior exposure to trauma were identified as notable risk factors, whereas optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends like usual, positive prediction about COVID-19, and daily exercise predicted fewer psychological symptoms. These results could aid in dynamic optimization of mental health services during and following COVID-19 pandemic.",

A concerted effort was made to ensure maximum participation from the countries that had the highest number of cases and >100 daily new cases (as reported on www.worldometers.info) as of March 29 th , 2020. These countries included USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, Iran, Turkey, and Switzerland. China 7 was not included in this list (from here on referred to as the featured countries) due to the number of daily new cases being <100 during the data collection period. In addition to the most severely affected countries, a concerted effort was made to include two countries each from the 11 th -20 th (Canada and Poland), and a country each from the 20 th -30 th (Bosnia and Herzegovina), and 30 th -40 th (Pakistan) most affected countries in the featured list. For the featured countries, national coordinators also reached out to at least 10 social media influencers and requested their voluntary help with the diffusion of the survey. The overall number of responses obtained via social media influencers was primarily a reflection of those from Pakistan, Spain, Switzerland, and USA. The data collection procedures were repeated at least thrice during the data collection period (March 29 th -April 14 th , 2020) with the aim to ensure participation of at least 250 participants each from the list of featured countries. This aim was achieved in all the featured countries with the exception of the UK, which was subsequently excluded from the featured list. For the non-featured countries, where the number of responses was less than 250 per country, the responses were grouped together based on the WHO regions (African Region AFRO, Region of the Americas PAHO, South East Asia Region SEARO, European Region EURO, East Mediterranean Region EMRO, and Western Pacific Region WMRO).

These studies reported PTSD, anxiety, distress, anger, and confusion as major sequelae of the epidemic and quarantine measures. 35,41-43 It has previously been reported, however, that very few studies investigated specific risk or protective factors 7 for these mental health disturbances. One notable study showed longer quarantine duration, boredom, financial instability, stigma, inadequate resources and information deficit to exacerbate the negative psychological impact from the SARS outbreak. In noteworthy contrast to our work, the study was performed several months after the epidemic had occurred. 44 Identification of specific risk and resilience factors is an essential first step for developing strategies to mitigate the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 at a regional and global level. For example, selective vulnerability of females indicated in this study warrants further investigation for both the contributing factors and the resulting implications of such increased risk. These include social factors such as increased reporting of domestic violence in relation to COVID-19 45 , possible caregiver stress, and the impact of changes in roles and responsibilities secondary to the current health .

Furthermore, increased risk of psychological perturbations in individuals with pre-existing psychiatric conditions and/or trauma exposure necessitates the initiation and/or expansion of mental health support systems available remotely. 40 Emerging evidence now supports the efficacy of web-and social-media based interventions in promoting mental health of masses focusing on paradigms based on mindfulness, positive psychology, and exercise. 46-48 Such interventions could be developed at the governmental and institutional levels and delivered to the masses via main-stream and social media. Indeed, media outlets could also play a major role in promoting optimism and a positive attitude towards COVID-19 resolution, both of which were identified in our study as important resilience factors. One example of media positivity could be reporting on 'number of active cases' rather than 'number of new cases', as this would also portray 'number of recoveries'. It is of notable possibility that this method could not only serve to reduce psychological distress and hopelessness, but could also provide a more accurate estimate of the burden on health systems. Furthermore, the association between remote working with increased psychological symptoms calls for optimization of the work-fromhome settings and a greater emphasis on the general well-being of employees. This is further corroborated by the observation that participant satisfaction with the employerresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with reduced psychological symptoms in this study. Finally, the association of suicidal ideation with both pre-existing psychiatric condition and previous trauma exposure merits awareness efforts to inform the public about these risks. Such a finding could also warrant targeted interventions by mental health entities to mitigate the risk of suicide in these vulnerable populations.",

In addition, healthcare professionals reported significantly lower BDI scores, suggesting this status to have a protective effect against depression (mean-coefficient: -0.09, 95 % CI: [-0.12, -0.06]). The logistic regression analyses performed after classifying SRQ, IES, and BDI scores into categorical cut-offs confirmed the primary results from the linear regression models (Supplementary Item S5). An individual with pre-existing psychiatric condition that worsened during COVID-19 showed 7-times higher odds of being depressed (OR: 7.10, 95% CI: [6.03, 8.35]), 1.6 times higher odds of having PTSD (OR:1.60, 95% CI: [1.38,1.84]) and twice higher odds of having general psychological disturbance (OR: 2.64, 95% CI: [1.99,3.48]). As expected, individuals with previous trauma exposure exhibited greater ORs than their counterpart for these conditions according to BDI (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: [1.46, 1.76]) and SRQ (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: [2.08, 3.30]). Still, an optimistic attitude and the opportunity to share concerns with family/friends like usual served as a protective factor for general psychological disturbance according to SRQ (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: [0.43, 0.62] and OR: 0.19, 95% CI: [0.15, 0.23] and depression according to BDI (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: [0.20, 0.26] and OR: 0.39, 95% CI: [0.33, 0.45] respectively. For the ease of understanding, the association of participant-related predictors with categorical classifications for general psychological disturbance (SRQ), PTSD (IES), and depression (BDI) are indicated through box-plots in Main Item 5. Owning a pet, preexisting psychiatric condition, previous exposure to trauma, considering oneself an introvert, and working remotely from home were associated with decreased %age of responses in the unaffected ('normal') category based on SRQ, IES, as well as BDI, suggesting these as risk factors. Contrastingly, a majority of responses from health professionals landed in the unaffected ('normal') category for BDI, indicating that working",

The only study with a larger sample size 40 employed a single scale for screening psychological disturbances. The administered measures in our study allowed for simultaneous screening of multiple psychiatric co-morbidities and the findings can provide invaluable insight to global health systems. The availability of the questionnaire in 11 different languages is a notable and unprecedented effort to provide the study as much generalizability as possible. Similarly, the 12 countries included in the featured list are not only representative of the different brackets of most severely affected countries globally, but also represent different economic strata. Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and USA are classified as high-income economies according to the World Bank Atlas, whereas, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey are middle or lower-income countries. 51 Furthermore, the timing of this study is an important strength as the data was collected from March 29 th -April 14 th , 2020. This timing coincides with the peak of COVID-19 pandemic in North America and Europe-a time period when almost one-half of the world remained in complete lock-down. 4 Finally, while cultural and linguistic factors are known to possibly impact psychological outcome measures when translations are utilized, the significant correlation between SRQ, IES, and BDI scores in this study cross-validates the assessment of psychological symptoms and confirms that COVID-19 pandemic is globally affecting the overall mental health of individuals.",

The third considerable limitation is the use of self-reporting scales rather than clinical verification. However, the anonymous nature of the survey and widespread social distancing measures preclude such verification. Additionally, it is not possible to adjust for the confounding effect of non-COVID-19-related individual crisis situations on participant responses. We tried to reduce this effect by formatting survey questions in such a way that would prompt participants to consider their mental state over the preceding week, rather than current mood. Another consideration is limited responses from the WHO African region AFRO, which necessitated exclusion of this very important region from the analysis. It is our hope that similar studies will be conducted in Africa in the future. Finally, a longitudinal assessment of the evolution of psychological symptoms in response to COVID-19 pandemic is imperative and indeed the subject of an ongoing investigation by our group.Utilizing the 'feedback' feature in our online questionnaire, several participants expressed that participation in the survey helped them focus on their mental health. Furthermore, a number of participants reported eating more than usual for comfort or out of boredom.This feedback could aid in efforts to develop mental health screens specific to COVID-19 pandemic. 52",

All figures were produced using the packages ggplot2 (Wickham et al., 2016) and CGPfunctions (Powell, 2020).Non-adjusted analysis for SRQ, IES, and BDI scores Mean scores with standard deviations were calculated for SRQ, IES and BDI scores from all valid responses (n=12,817) and compared across all of the following categorical predictors via Kruskal-Wallis tests with the Chi-square function. The categorical predictors included gender, residential status, education level, employment status, being a medical professional, working remotely from home, satisfaction with employer, satisfaction with the state (government), home-isolation status, interaction with family and friends, social media usage, ability to share concerns with a mental health professional, ability to share concerns with family and friends, prior exposure to a human crisis situation, previous exposure to trauma, level of extroversion, prediction about COVID-19 resolution and one's self-determined role in the pandemic.Multiple Regression Models for SRQ, IES, and BDIMultiple linear and logistic regression models were built for SRQ, IES, and BDI using mean scores and cut-offs for respective categorical classification.For linear regression, generalized linear models with the glm function were devised using the lme4 package(Bates et al., 2015). The three univariate linear regression models, one each for SRQ, IES, and BDI, were fitted and corrected for multiple comparisons followed by glm function analyses. Following the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the p-value threshold was set to 0.017. For each linear regression model, 'age' was entered as a continuous independent predictor whereas all aforementioned predictors were entered as categorical fixed effects. Poisson family and log link function were used to model BDI and SRQ factors. In order to choose the best model (based on Akaike information criterion; AIC or Bayesian information criterion; BIC) from the set of predictors, stepwise model selection was performed from the MASS package(Venables et al., 2002).",
