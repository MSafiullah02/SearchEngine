            "text": "Simulation is rapidly permeating into every sphere of medical education, including teaching, assessment, and research.1 Publications about SBME have grown exponentially over the past 10 years.1, 2 In addition, the quality of the studies published on SBME has consistently increased, as illustrated by a series of reviews published by Issenberg, McGaghie and colleagues.3, 4, 5 This impressive body of evidence now includes original studies, narrative and systematic reviews, opinion and position papers in different clinical domains, as well as a fewer number of publications specifically related to critical care medicine. These studies combined with the research findings in other clinical areas demonstrate the relevance of SBME for critical care health professionals.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 In the presence of such an extensive literature, it seemed superfluous to undertake another systematic review on the topic of simulation in critical care medicine. However, this abundance of information on SBME can be overwhelming for critical care educators who attempt, in the midst of many other professional responsibilities, to design, implement, and evaluate sound educational innovations or curricula for their trainees. The focus of this review on SBME is therefore to summarize the evidence relevant for frontline educators in critical care medicine. The authors briefly examine 5 practical questions aimed at better understanding the nature of SBME, its theoretic and proven benefits, its delivery, as well as the challenges posed by SBME. The term SBME is used broadly to include education of all health care professionals. Although SBME has traditionally been predominantly focused on physicians, simulation studies are increasingly directed toward other health care professionals, such as nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians.12, 13, 14\n",

            "text": "SBME has shown promising results in many areas relevant for critical care educators. Specific examples related to technical and nontechnical skills, system issues, and assessment tools are presented in Box 2\n. When appropriate, the Kirkpatrick's level of learning outcomes measured by individual studies is indicated. Simulation is also being increasingly considered in 2 other educational domains: high-stakes assessment and mass casualty training. Simulation-based assessment is not a new phenomenon and has been incorporated in licensure and certification examination at the undergraduate and postgraduate level for many years.52 More recently, simulation has also been used in regulatory programs for practicing physicians in the fields of anesthesia, internal medicine, and family medicine.52 In addition to part-task trainers and simulated patients, full-body manikin simulators are now increasingly used for high-stakes assessment.53 As the caveats of simulation-based assessment are better understood and slowly overcome (eg, psychometric properties and technological limitations),53 simulation will likely play an important role in high-stakes assessment in critical care. Finally, SBME has been shown to be useful for mass casualty training54 and may represent a useful tool for health care professional training in response to specific threats, such as the recent Ebola epidemic.55\nBox 2Selected evidence supporting a role for SBME in different domains relevant to critical care\nTechnical skillsProceduresCentral line insertion (KL 1\u20134)46, 64, 65, 66, 67\nAirway management and endotracheal intubation (KL 2, 3, 4)68, 69, 70, 71\nBronchoscopy (KL 2\u20133)72, 73\nCricothyroidotomy (KL 2)74\nThoracocentesis (KL 2)75\nParacentesis (KL 2)76\nUltrasonography skills, including echocardiography (KL 1, 2)77, 78\n\nTask-related technical skillsNeurocritical skills (KL 1)79\nACLS skills (KL 1\u20134)14, 80, 81, 82, 83\nTask management of critical care crises (KL 1, 2)84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89\nTask management of patients with trauma (KL 1, 2)84, 90\nKnowledge and skills in respiratory mechanics, mechanical ventilation, and circulation (KL 3)91\n\n\nNontechnical skills/teamworkCrisis resource management skills (KL 1, 2)40, 92, 93, 94, 95\nTeam behaviors during ATLS (KL 2)90, 96\nTeam crisis responses, including outcomes of simulated patient and communication (KL 2)97\nInterprofessional team responses of undergraduate students (KL 1)98\nMET performance (KL 2, 4)99\nTeamwork during postcardiac surgery pediatric cardiac arrest (KL 1)100\n\nSystem-based processesInterphysician variability in ICU admission of patients with end-stage cancer101\nNursing hand-offs of patients in ICU102\nDiscrepancies between institutional or departmental policies and clinical practice related to obstetric emergencies103\nInfectious disease challenges during SARS cardiac arrests104\n\nAssessment tools: validation studiesTeamworkMayo High Performance Teamwork scale for CRM skills105\nSelf-assessment tool of teamwork in critical care106\nClinical Teamwork Scale107\nCrisis management behavior performance markers108\nTEAM109\n\nIndividual nontechnical skillsAnesthesia nontechnical skills system110\nOttawa Global Rating Scale for nontechnical skills111, 112\nFamily Conference OSCE for professionalism and communication skills113\nChecklist for professionalism during ethical dilemma114\n\nIndividual technical or mixed skillsInterdisciplinary management of septic shock115\nIntegrated Procedural Performance Instrument for technical and communication skills116\nScenario-specific performance checklist for pediatric scenarios,117 undergraduates,118 and acute care scenarios119, 120\nIPETT for emergency technical and nontechnical skills121\nComparison between written examination, simulation-based, and oral viva examinations for procedural skills122\n\n\n\nAbbreviations: ACLS, Advanced Cardiac Life Support; ATLS, Advanced Trauma Life Support; CRM, crisis resource management; ICU, intensive care unit; IPETT, Imperial Pediatric Emergency Training Toolkit; KL, Kirkpatrick's level; MET, medical emergency team; OSCE, Objective Structured Clinical Examination; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; TEAM, Team Emergency Assessment Measure.",

Most of these studies have compared SBME with other types of educational interventions such as video training, case-based or problem-based discussions, and traditional teaching. Limitations in the methodological rigor of many studies supporting the role of SBME, as well as inconsistencies regarding its efficacy when compared with other learning strategies, call for thoughtful reflection as to when simulation should, or should not, be used for critical care instruction. In this regard, another type of literature on SBME, described in the following section, helps to further inform the judicious use of SBME in critical care medicine.",

For example, Springer and colleagues61 concluded that multiple 30-min simulation sessions held over 3 consecutive days were more effective than one 90-min session to improve resident knowledge regarding recognition and management of septic shock. Ali and colleagues62 reported that both students and instructors perceived the use of mechanical simulators and of simulated patients as equally satisfactory for ATLS training. Such studies can contribute to the improvement of SBME by increasing its efficacy or reducing its costs. However, there are still a large number of unanswered questions regarding the best ways to optimize the use of SBME. This is an area that requires further high-quality research.",

            "text": "First, the authors feel the need to address the aspects of health care professional training that SBME will not address. Clinical training is challenging in part because of the lack of availability of dedicated clinical teachers (who struggle to fulfill other professional responsibilities) and motivated trainees (overwhelming workload, working hours limitation, etc.). Health care resources are globally limited. The lack of time and scarcity of human and financial resources identified as barriers for clinical learning also apply to SBME. Clinically competent, properly trained simulation instructors are a rarity in most institutions. Training faculty to fulfill these responsibilities is time and resource consuming. Furthermore, the authors do not share the enthusiasm of others regarding the potential to add hours of SBME to the working hours of medical trainees. The educational value of any training completed beyond 80 hours of clinical work is questionable. Although the mistakes committed in a simulated environment will not harm any patient, tired trainees are unlikely to efficiently learn and to positively process their simulation experience. Furthermore, the time and energy invested in SBME necessarily redirect part of the energy and resources from clinical-based training toward SBME. Such unilateral shift could potentially represent additional impediments to the improvement of clinical-based learning, still recognized, even among the strongest proponents of SBME, as a core component of health care education. The authors believe that clinical-based learning and SBME can inform and complement each other in many aspects of training. In their opinion, recent calls for better curricular integration of SBME are an encouraging step in the right direction. SBME is not a panacea that will fix all the medical education problems, and clinical-based training should continue to be a high priority for medical educators and researchers.",

            "text": "The second challenge faced by SBME is the significant gap between the theoretic understanding of how SBME should be delivered and the way it is currently delivered in most institutions. With the exception of a few programs led by groups of committed and trained educators, SBME is frequently delivered in an ad hoc and unsystematic manner, separate from the broader curriculum. Box 4\nsuggests an approach to SBME based on general principles of curriculum development.63 Far from wanting to blame educators, their intention is rather to highlight how difficult it can be for an educational intervention to present most of the features of effective SBME. In an attempt to be pragmatic about the implementation of SBME, educators must often select one of 2 features on which to focus their time and energy. The real benefits of SBME as currently applied may therefore be less than the ones presented in the literature.Box 4Development and curricular integration of SBME\n1.Identification of an educational problemWhich educational need is not adequately addressed by the current curriculum?How is this problem currently addressed?Could SBME help address this problem?\n2.Targeted need assessmentWhich learners should be targeted for this program/activity?What are the learners' specific needs?Is a simulated learning environment appropriate to address these needs?\n3.Goals and objectivesWhat are the general goals of this program/activity?What are the measurable objectives that will be achieved?\n4.Educational strategiesWhich simulation modality is the most appropriate to achieve these goals?Which instructional method will be the most helpful?How should the simulation activity/program be presented (timing, duration, feedback, etc.)?\n5.ImplementationWhich kind of support/resources will be required?Which barriers to implementation can be expected?\n6.Evaluation and feedbackHow will feedback be obtained from individual learners?How will this activity be assessed at the program level?\n\n",

The authors have many reasons to be optimistic about SBME: the role of SBME is expanding (identification of gaps in clinical training and practice; undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing education; formative and high-stakes assessment), the quality of evidence to support its use is increasing, and the strategies to implement SBME effectively and efficiently are better understood. There seems to be a consensus in the literature that SBME has an important role to play in the improvement of the safety of the care delivered in health care institutions; patient outcomes can be affected by our educational choices. These conclusions likely apply to the critical care environment in which patient outcomes critically depend on timely, complex, and highly coordinated care. However, significant research is still needed to further explore the advantages and limitations of SBME for specific clinical activities completed in particular clinical contexts. Such efforts should be coordinated with larger educational initiatives aimed at providing the best and most comprehensive educational experience for the critical care trainees.",
