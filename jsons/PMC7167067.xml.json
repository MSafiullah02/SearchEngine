            "text": "Phagocytosis plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immunity by facilitating the removal and killing of pathogens while priming the adaptive immune response. Phagocytosis is a receptor\u2010mediated event. Direct or indirect (opsonin\u2010mediated) recognition of the target particle by receptors on the surface of professional phagocytes triggers signaling events that mediate actin\u2010dependent particle internalization. Receptors able to mediate phagocytosis are structurally diverse and include a variety of receptor families [1, 2], such as Fc\u03b3Rs (Fc\u03b3RI, \u2010IIa, \u2010IIc, and \u2010IIIa), integrins (such as CR3, CR4, \u03b15\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, and LFA\u20101) [3, 4, 5\u20136], scavenger receptors (such as scavenger receptor I, CD36, MARCO) [7, 8\u20139], C\u2010type lectin receptors (such as Dectin\u20101, dendritic cell\u2010cell\u2010specific intercellular adhesion molecule\u20103\u2010grabbing nonintegrin, mannose receptor), glycoproteins (such as CD44) [10], and adhesion molecules (such as carcinoembryonic antigen\u2010related cell adhesion molecule 3) [11]. This list has expanded in the last years, and it is expected to continue growing, as the receptors involved in certain phagocytic processes have not been defined yet.",

            "text": "Membrane peptidases are a multifunctional group of ectoenzymes involved in several processes, including growth, differentiation, activation, cell\u2013cell interactions, and trafficking. Interestingly, their participation in such processes is not always dependent on their peptidase activity [12]. Aminopeptidase N/CD13 is a transmembrane ectoenzyme expressed in several tissues. Among hematopoietic cells, CD13 expression is restricted to stem cells and most developmental stages of myeloid cells, to such an extent that CD13 has been considered a myelomonocytic marker [13]. CD13 cleaves N\u2010terminal neutral amino acids of small peptides, and its substrates and functions vary according to the tissue where it is expressed. However, additional functions, independent of its enzymatic activity, have been attributed to CD13 [14]. Inhibition of CD13 enzymatic activity by pharmacological inhibitors, active\u2010site mutations or inhibitory antibodies, is evidence that at least 3 types of functions of CD13 do not require its enzymatic activity: 1) as a viral receptor [15, 16\u201317], 2) as an adhesion molecule [18, 19\u201320], and 3) as a signaling molecule [20, 21, 22\u201323]. Interestingly, all of these functions rely on CD13 cross\u2010linking on the plasma membrane by antibodies or viral ligands, which presumably leads to signal transduction.",

            "text": "Structurally, CD13 is a heavily glycosylated type II membrane protein with a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain of 8 aa. Despite having a very short cytoplasmic region, CD13 cross\u2010linking by antibodies or viral ligands induces intracellular signals, such as intracellular Ca2+ increases; activation of Src, PI3K, FAK, and the Ras/MAPK pathway; cytokine secretion [20, 23, 24]; and CD13 association to actin fibers [20, 25]. Given that the short intracellular domain of CD13 contains no classic signaling motifs, it has been proposed that CD13 might require an auxiliary protein to transduce signals. In line with this, CD13 coimmunoprecipitates with the adaptor molecules Grb2/Sos in U\u2010937 monocytes [18], providing a possible link between CD13 aggregation and MAPK signaling. Furthermore, a recent report showed that CD13 is constitutively associated to the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 and that upon CD13 aggregation, \u03b1\u2010actinin is recruited into the complex, linking membrane\u2010bound CD13 to the cytoskeleton [20]. However, that same study showed that upon aggregation, CD13 is phosphorylated on the Tyr6 of its cytoplasmic domain in a Src\u2010dependent manner and that this phosphorylation is required for ERK and FAK activation, as well as for CD13\u2010mediated adhesion [20]. This observation emphasizes that despite being very short, the cytoplasmic region of CD13 participates directly in cellular signaling.",

            "text": "We [18, 19] and others [20, 26] have shown that antibody\u2010induced CD13 aggregation mediates monocyte\u2010monocyte and monocyte\u2010endothelial cell adhesion in vitro and in vivo in a tyrosine kinase\u2010dependent manner. Phagocytosis shares biochemical mechanisms with adhesion, spreading, and migration, as all of these processes require coordinated cytoskeletal reorganization. Indeed, there are several examples of membrane molecules that work as cell adhesion molecules and phagocytic receptors, including CR3 [27, 28], CD44 [10, 29], CD36 [30], and \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin [5], among others [31]. The first suggestion that CD13 was possibly involved in phagocytosis dates back to 1996, when a positive correlation between CD13 expression and phagocytosis of microspheres was observed in hMDMs [32]. We have reported previously that CD13 cross\u2010linking by antibodies during phagocytosis of zymosan particles or heat\u2010killed Escherichia coli led to a more efficient uptake in macrophages and dendritic cells [33]. Furthermore, an increase in Fc\u03b3RI\u2010mediated phagocytosis was also observed in monocytes and macrophages when particles interacted simultaneously with CD13 and Fc\u03b3RI compared with the phagocytosis of particles interacting with Fc\u03b3RI alone. Likewise, the cocross\u2010linking of CD13 with Fc\u03b3RI by specifc mAb increases the pSyk level and duration compared with cross\u2010linking Fc\u03b3RI alone [34]. These results suggest that CD13 aggregation can trigger signaling pathways required for phagocytosis. Finally, some data in our previous works also suggested that besides acting as a positive modulator of phagocytosis, CD13 might function as a phagocytic receptor in U\u2010937 [34] and dendritic cells [33], although this was not studied thoroughly. In this paper, we examined whether CD13 can function as a primary phagocytic receptor. We found that CD13 is a competent phagocytic receptor capable of mediating phagocytosis of large particles independently of other phagocytic receptors, the signaling pathway required for phagocytosis through CD13 involves Syk and PI3K, and finally, that CD13 cross\u2010linking induces ROS production.",

Erythrocytes loaded with CFSE and labeled with biotin\u2010streptavidin, were coated with biotin\u2010F(ab)\u20322 fragments of goat anti\u2010mouse IgG (EBS\u2010Fab). These EBS\u2010Fabs would only interact with molecules on the cell surface with bound Fab fragments of specific murine mAb. As the specificity of the system is based on antibodies, and several cells used in this work express Fc\u03b3Rs, we used Fab fragments to exclude any possible contribution of Fc\u03b3Rs to the phagocytosis (\nFig. 1A\n). Cells were preincubated on ice with Fab fragments of anti\u2010CD13 mAb452 (Fab452), Fab fragments of anti\u2010Fc\u03b3RI mAb32.2 (Fab32.2) as positive control, an isotype control antibody (murine IgG1), or no treatment (basal phagocytosis). Cells were washed, mixed with EBS\u2010Fab, and incubated at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C for the time periods indicated. After incubation, noninternalized erythrocytes were lysed by hypotonic shock. The percentage of cells with internalized erythrocytes (CFSE\u2010positive cells) was determined by flow cytometry after quenching any extracellular fluorescence by use of Trypan blue. We found that the binding of EBS\u2010Fab to the cells through CD13 induced its efficient internalization by the human monocytic cell line THP\u20101 (mean 28.5%) compared with isotype\u2010matched control antibody (mean 2.5%) or no treatment (mean 3.6%; Fig. 1B and C; n = 25).

When we compared the PI (PI = % CFSE\u2010positive cells multiplied by mean fluorescence intensity), we obtained similar results to those from comparing the positive cell percentage, as the mean PI of internalization through Fc\u03b3RI is slightly higher than the mean PI through CD13, both in THP\u20101 cells (Supplemental Fig. 1A) and in macrophages (Supplemental Fig. 1B). Hence, in this system, although phagocytosis through the canonic phagocytic receptor Fc\u03b3RI is higher, phagocytosis through CD13 is fully competent, reaching levels of >80% of Fc\u03b3RI\u2010mediated phagocytosis. To ascertain further that cell\u2010associated fluorescence truly represents CD13\u2010mediated internalization of EBS\u2010Fabs, we verified particle uptake by light (not shown) and confocal microscopy. Typical confocal microscopic images of the internalization of EBS\u2010Fab through CD13 in THP\u20101 and MDMs are shown in Figs. 1E and 2D, respectively. The number of internalized particles/cell was similar after internalization through CD13 or Fc\u03b3RI in THP\u20101 cells and MDMs, in line with the comparison between PIs. Importantly, particles visualized inside of the cells after internalization through CD13 or Fc\u03b3RI are of similar size, both in THP\u20101 cells (Fig. 1E) and in MDMs (Fig. 2D). Phagocytosed particles are \u223c4 \u00b5m in size, which rules out other forms of internalization, such as caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis [characterized by small (50\u201380 nm) vesicles) or clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis (characterized by 100 nm vesicles)]. Altogether, these data indicate that CD13 is capable of mediating phagocytosis of large (\u22654 \u00b5m) particles.",

The increase in phagocytosis through Fc\u03b3RI in L2 cells compared with control cells is not statistically significant and might be explained by the fact that Fc\u03b3RI expression is higher in L2 cells. These results are in line with recent work in murine CD13 null animals [35], which showed that lack of CD13 does not affect Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis. However, it is important to stress that although the absence of CD13 does not impair phagocytosis through Fc\u03b3Rs, cross\u2010linking of CD13 positively regulates phagocytosis through Fc\u03b3Rs, as we reported previously [34].",

            "text": "Actin dynamics for phagocytosis are regulated by signaling pathways activated downstream of ligated phagocytic receptors. The best\u2010understood signaling pathways during phagocytosis are those triggered by the opsonic receptors Fc\u03b3Rs and CR3. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk becomes activated by phosphorylation upon Fc\u03b3R or CR3 cross\u2010linking by antibodies or ligand\u2010bearing particles [1]. Several studies have demonstrated that Syk is required for Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis, but the role of Syk in CR3\u2010mediated phagocytosis has been somewhat controversial, as CR3 phagocytosis is normal in Syk\u2010deficient macrophages [36] but is severely impaired by transfer of Syk\u2010siRNA or dominant\u2010negative Syk into macrophage\u2010like, differentiated HL\u201060 cells [37]. In the case of the \u03b2\u2010glucan receptor Dectin\u20101, it has been shown that although Dectin\u20101 activates Syk, phagocytosis through Dectin\u20101 is independent of Syk in macrophages but dependent on Syk in fibroblasts, suggesting that Dectin\u20101\u2010mediated phagocytosis involves novel signaling kinases as well as Syk [38, 39]. Therefore, it seems that Syk activation is not indispensable for all types of phagocytic receptors, even though they are able to activate Syk upon ligation. To investigate whether CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis is dependent on Syk activation, we used the pharmacological inhibitor of Syk, piceatannol. We preincubated THP\u20101 cells or hMDMs in the presence of 50 \u03bcM piceatannol or DMSO as vehicle control and measured phagocytosis of EBS\u2010Fabs. Treatment of cells with piceatannol completely abolished phagocytosis mediated through CD13 in hMDMs (\nFig. 5A\n; mean DMSO 24.7% vs. piceatannol 6.0%, n = 5) and in THP\u20101 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2A; mean DMSO 25.3% vs. piceatannol 6.3%, n = 8). As shown in Fig. 5A (and Supplemental Fig. 2A), treatment of cells with Fab452 and piceatannol resulted in CFSE\u2010positive cell percentages similar to background phagocytosis (No Fab; dotted line), both in hMDMs and THP\u20101 cells. Phagocytosis, through Fc\u03b3RI, as anticipated, was also abolished by treatment of cells with piceatannol in hMDMs and THP\u20101 cells (Fig. 5A and Supplemental Fig. 2A). To be fully certain about the role of Syk in CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis, we used a second, more specific Syk inhibitor, BAY, reported to have >600\u2010fold selectivity for Syk than against other kinases, as piceatannol, although used extensively as a Syk inhibitor, has only \u223c10\u2010fold selectivity for Syk over other kinases involved in phagocytosis, including PI3K and Src kinases [40, 41]. We preincubated hMDMs in medium with 1 or 10 \u00b5M BAY or DMSO as vehicle control and measured phagocytosis of EBS\u2010Fabs. As shown in Fig. 5B, CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis was reduced by 35% in the cells treated with BAY (mean DMSO 30.2% vs. BAY 10 \u00b5M 19.9% or BAY 1 \u00b5M 19.4%, n = 7). The partial inhibition of phagocytosis through CD13 was not a result of incomplete Syk inhibition, as phagocytosis through Fc\u03b3RI was abolished completely at both BAY concentrations used (Fig. 5B; mean DMSO 35.6% vs. BAY 10 \u00b5M 2.2% or BAY 1 \u00b5M 3.3%, n = 7). Thus, activation of Syk contributes to, but is not essential for, CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis.

Phosphorylation of Syk, following CD13 aggregation, was statistically different from nonstimulated cells (secondary Fabs only) and also from cells stimulated by Fc\u03b3RI aggregation for 45 seconds (Fig. 5D; n = 5). Interestingly, we observed that CD13 aggregation induces stronger Syk phosphorylation than Fc\u03b3RI aggregation when analyzed shortly after ligation (45 seconds), suggesting that pSyk\u2010induced by CD13 or Fc\u03b3RI cross\u2010linking follows different kinetics. Indeed, in preliminary experiments to determine the optimal time\u2010point to measure Syk activation after CD13 cross\u2010linking, we found that CD13 aggregation induces a rapid phosphorylation of Syk that peaks at 40 seconds and starts to drop soon after. In contrast, Fc\u03b3RI\u2010induced phosphorylation of Syk peaks after 60 seconds of receptor aggregation, and the phosphorylation is maintained for several minutes [42]. Together, these data indicate that CD13 aggregation induces phosphorylation of Syk and that CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis in macrophages is partially dependent on Syk activation.",

During Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis, PI3K activation lies downstream of Syk, and its activation is essential for phagocytosis. As we observed that CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis is partially dependent on Syk and that CD13 cross\u2010linking induces Syk activation, we next examined the requirement of PI3K during CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis. THP\u20101 cells or hMDMs were preincubated with the PI3K inhibitor LY, and phagocytosis was measured. Treatment of cells with LY resulted in a strong impairment of CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis in hMDMs (Fig. 5E; mean DMSO 27.4% vs. LY 7.1%, n = 5) and in THP\u20101 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2B; mean DMSO 25.3% vs. LY 5.6%, n = 9). As reported extensively, phagocytosis through Fc\u03b3RI was inhibited completely in the presence of LY, both in human macrophages (Fig. 5E; mean DMSO 31.6% vs. LY 6.6%) and in THP\u20101 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2B; mean DMSO 29.3% vs. LY 2.7%).

To further confirm the role of CD13 as a primary phagocytic receptor, we expressed CD13 in the epithelial cell line HEK293. These cells lack the expression of most phagocytic receptors and CD13. With the use of a lentiviral delivery system, we infected HEK293 cells with a vector to express hCD13 and RFP under separate promoters. As control, we excised hCD13 from the vector, leaving only the RFP construct. After selection and cloning, we obtained clones with high (clone A6) and medium (clone A4) hCD13 expression (\nFig. 7A\n). Cells infected with RFP virus (clone M6) did not express hCD13 (Fig. 7A). As HEK293 cells grow as monolayers that attach to the plastic surface, and we noted that repeated washing disrupts the monolayers and affects cell viability, we modified the construction of phagocytic preys so that they carried the specific Fab [Fab anti\u2010CD13 (EFab452) or Fab anti\u2010Fc\u03b3RI (EFab32.2) or no Fab (Ec; Supplemental Fig. 3)]. With the use of this modified construction of the phagocytic prey, the cell monolayer is not subjected to repeated washing steps before incubation with the particles. We verified phagocytosis of these modified phagocytic preys in THP\u20101 cells by cytometry (Fig. 7B; n = 4) and confocal microscopy (not shown), obtaining similar results to those found with the use of the original construction of phagocytic preys. HEK293 hCD13high (A6) and HEK293 hCD13med (A4) clones are capable of internalizing Fab452\u2010opsonized but not Fab32.2\u2010opsonized phagocytic preys (Fig. 7C; n = 5). HEK293 hCD13neg (M6) cells did not internalize any phagocytic prey. It is interesting to note that the extent of internalization of phagocytic preys correlated with the level of hCD13 expression, as HEK293 hCD13high cells (A6) are more competent internalizing erythrocytes (28%) than HEK293 hCD13med (A4;15%). Cytometry results were confirmed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7D, we observed internalized erythrocytes in A6 cells only when they were opsonized with Fab anti\u2010CD13 (lower left panels) but no internalization when erythrocytes were opsonized with anti\u2010Fc\u03b3RI (lower right panels). The upper panels in Fig. 7D show the same conditions for M6 cells. Importantly, this experiment allowed us to rule out the contribution of Fc\u03b3Rs and other major phagocytic receptors in phagocytosis mediated by CD13, as HEK293 cells lack expression of Fc\u03b3Rs, CR3 [44, 45\u201346], and most scavenger receptors [47, 48]. These results further support the role of CD13 as a receptor capable of inducing internalization, independently of other phagocytic receptors. Altogether, these data provide strong evidence that CD13 aggregation by interaction with particles mediates phagocytosis and that CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis is independent of Fc\u03b3Rs.",

As J774 cells express murine CD13 [49] and murine Fc\u03b3Rs, we first verified that the Fabs used for the phagocytosis assay did not bind to murine cells. Neither the Fab452 nor the Fab32.2 recognized molecules on the murine cells.

R3 cells internalize erythrocytes very efficiently (Fig. 8C) compared with internalization by hCD13high HEK293 cells (Fig. 7D), which might be explained by the fact that whereas J774 are professional phagocytes, HEK293 cells are not so.",

In the present work, we provide strong evidence that CD13 can act as a primary phagocytic receptor even in the absence of other major phagocytic receptors. CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis depends on actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and on PI3K activity and is only partially dependent on Syk activity.

The reported forms of CD13\u2010mediated endocytosis are caveolae\u2010mediated endocytosis [25, 55] and clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis [50, 56]. Therefore, it seems that CD13 can mediate different mechanisms of internalization, where the nature of the ligand and the cell type dictate the path of endocytosis. In this regard, CD13 is similar to other phagocytic receptors capable of mediating different forms of internalization, depending on the size of the ligand\u2010bearing entity, such as Fc\u03b3Rs, mannose receptor, Dectin\u20101, and scavenger receptors.",

            "text": "The natural ligand(s) of CD13, capable of inducing its aggregation and the phagocytosis of large particles in vivo, are currently unknown. Both exogenous and endogenous polyvalent ligands for CD13 have been identified. Human CMV [17, 57] and an important subgroup of coronaviruses [15, 58], including the HCoV\u2010229E [52], are exogenous polyvalent ligands for CD13 identified to date. The binding of HCoV\u2010229E to human fibroblasts results in CD13 clustering, and more importantly, CD13 aggregation induced by HCoV\u2010229E mirrors the consequences of antibody\u2010induced CD13 aggregation regarding adhesion [19] and CD13 distribution on the cell membrane [25]. As for endogenous ligands, several lines of evidence suggest that galectin\u20103 might constitute an endogenous ligand for CD13. Yang et al. [59] used a human cDNA phage display biopanning method to identify proteins interacting with CD13 and found that 70% of the isolated clones encoded galectin\u20103, which suggests that galectin\u20103 is a likely endogenous ligand of CD13. Furthermore, in a study that uses affinity chromatography to identify ligands of galectin\u20103 in seminal fluid, CD13 was found to be 1 of the 9 proteins identified [60]. Moreover, galectin\u20103 coimmunoprecipitates with CD13 in resting U\u2010937 cells [61], and CD13 and galectin\u20103 colocalize in HUVECs after addition of exogenous galectin\u20103 [59]. All of these data suggest that galectin\u20103 is an endogenous ligand of CD13 in vivo. Galectin\u20103 is a \u03b2\u2010galactoside\u2010binding lectin, constitutively expressed and secreted by various cell types, including macrophages [62]. Galectin\u20103 expression is highly up\u2010regulated during monocyte\u2010to\u2010macrophage differentiation [63] and during various infectious processes [64, 65\u201366], and galectin\u20103 is present in considerable amounts in the extracellular space at inflammatory sites [62, 65]. Extracellular galectin\u20103 can function in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to mediate cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013ECM interactions [67, 68] and monocyte and macrophage migration [69] and promotes cellular responses, such as respiratory burst [63, 70] and phagocytosis [65, 71, 72]. Importantly, galectin\u20103 binds to surface glycans of bacteria [73, 74], protista [75, 76], fungi [77, 78], and parasites [72]. Thus, the potential role of galectin\u20103 as a pattern recognition receptor has become an area of intense attention. Galectin\u20103 can oligomerize, forming multivalent molecules capable of interacting with several ligands at a time and of cross\u2010linking cell\u2010surface glycoproteins [79]. Therefore, it is enticing to propose that galectin\u20103 might be functioning as an opsonin mediating the interaction of pathogens with CD13 and phagocytosis in vivo. In a recent paper, a role for galectin\u20103 as an opsonin enhancing the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages has been proposed [71], raising the possibility that the galectin\u20103\u2013CD13 pair is functional in pathogenic and stressful settings. Further studies are needed to determine whether galectin\u20103 can act as an opsonin to promote CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis in vivo.",

Indeed, we were able to show that in hMDMs, cross\u2010linking of CD13 with antibodies results in a rapid phosphorylation of Syk that peaks at 45 seconds and decreases rapidly. This fast phosphorylation/dephosphorylation kinetics could account for differences between these results and our previous studies, where we were unable to detect pSyk from 3 to 20 minutes after CD13 cross\u2010linking in U\u2010937 cells, assayed by immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting. Possibly, our inability to detect pSyk in our previous studies was related to differences in detection timing, cell type, and technique used [34]. The results in this paper show that CD13 aggregation induces rapid pSyk and that phagocytosis through CD13 likely involves activation of Syk as well as other early kinases that are necessary for the recruitment and activation of downstream signaling.",

However, it was recently shown that in the U\u2010937 monocytic cell line, CD13 cross\u2010linking by antibodies induced phosphorylation of several proteins, including FAK, ERK, and remarkably, the phosphorylation of CD13 on its cytoplasmic tail in a Src\u2010dependent manner. The pharmacological inhibition of Src\u2010, ERK\u2010, or FAK\u2010abrogated, CD13\u2010dependent adhesion and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD13 was found to be essential for Src, ERK, and FAK activation and for CD13\u2010mediated adhesion [20]. This study identified the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic part of CD13 as a crucial event in CD13\u2010mediated intracellular signaling, and it is possible that this phosphorylation event is in some way related to the activation of Syk observed by us after CD13 aggregation. This same study reported that anti\u2010CD13 antibody\u2010induced adhesion does not depend on Syk activation, as treatment of U\u2010937 with piceatannol (10 \u00b5M) did not impair adhesion [20]. These results are in agreement with our results that use the Syk inhibitor, BAY, where we found that CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis is impaired but able to proceed in the absence of Syk activation. The partial effect of Syk inhibition by BAY on CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis could suggest that other kinases, not inhibited by BAY but inhibited by piceatannol, participate along with Syk in CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis. The identity of the other kinases involved in CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis is currently unknown. However, given that CD13 aggregation recruits and activates FAK [20], it seems plausible that FAK might be responsible for PI3K recruitment and activation during CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis, as has been observed in signaling by CR3 and other integrins.",

It has been shown previously that CD13 cross\u2010linking by antibodies induces actin rearrangements leading to adhesion [19, 20]. Fc\u03b3R\u2010 and CR3\u2010mediated phagocytosis are accompanied by the local recruitment of \u03b1\u2010actinin [80], a protein that can bundle actin filaments. In this way, \u03b1\u2010actinin links the force generated by the actin network to the bound particle.

We demonstrated that the expression of CD13 on nonphagocytic HEK293 cells is sufficient to enable them to phagocytose through CD13. Moreover, as these cells do not express Fc\u03b3Rs (nor most phagocytic receptors), these data further support the notion that CD13 is a bona fide phagocytic receptor. It has been shown that CD13 and Fc\u03b3RI coredistribute on the cell membrane after the cross\u2010linking of either one of them in monocytes and macrophages [34]. Therefore, one concerning possibility existed: that particle\u2010induced CD13 aggregation during phagocytosis would also aggregate Fc\u03b3RI, and the observed CD13\u2010mediated internalization of particles resulted from the signaling triggered by aggregation of Fc\u03b3RI, making CD13\u2010induced phagocytosis dependent on Fc\u03b3RI. As HEK293 cells do not express Fc\u03b3Rs, it is clear that CD13 does not depend on Fc\u03b3RI to mediate phagocytosis, as HEK293 cells expressing hCD13 internalize erythrocytes through CD13 very efficiently. These data show that CD13 is a primary phagocytic receptor, capable of acting independently of other phagocytic receptors. However, it is extremely difficult to rule out completely the possibility that other unknown cosignaling molecules expressed on HEK293 can be participating in CD13\u2010mediated phagocytosis. Under physiologic conditions, several types of receptors are activated in parallel, and multiple signaling cascades are triggered concomitantly. Hence, it is possible that in more natural settings, where CD13 is expressed on the cell membrane along with other phagocytic receptors sharing common signaling pathways with CD13, phagocytosis, through CD13, might be regulated by other receptors engaged by the phagocytic prey, just like we have shown that CD13 modulates phagocytosis by other receptors [33, 34]. CD13\u2010deficient THP\u20101 cells or bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages from CD13\u2010deficient mice [35] showed no alteration in phagocytosis through Fc\u03b3Rs, demonstrating that although CD13 aggregation enhances phagocytosis through Fc\u03b3Rs, this phagocytosis is not dependent on CD13. Likewise, phagocytosis through CD13 is not dependent on Fc\u03b3RI, although it might be enhanced by the coaggregation of Fc\u03b3RI.",
