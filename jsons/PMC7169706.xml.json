This fact has likely increased the ability to diagnose infectious pneumonia and probably has led to the identification of a high number of cases with co\u2010pathogens as compared to conventional microbiological studies (ie, viral culture or antigen testing only available for some CARVs). Currently, there is a lack of studies analyzing in detail the incidence, characteristics, and consequences of co\u2010infective pathogens in the LRT in the setting of CARVs LRTD after allo\u2010HSCT. Some studies have reported that the presence of co\u2010infective agents at the time of CARVs LRTD may increase overall mortality.5, 7, 8, 9, 10 However, it is still unknown to what extent such increase in mortality could only be attributed to the co\u2010infection by itself or by the aggressiveness of the concurrent co\u2010infective pathogens. To elucidate this issue, clinical outcome comparisons between CARVs LRTD co\u2010infection, CARVs LRTD mono\u2010infection and other mono\u2010infections (ie, bacterial pneumonia mono\u2010infection) are suitable to better establish the putative effect of each microbiological co\u2010pathogen in the outcome.",

Technical methodologies have been previously reported in detail elsewhere.15 The Luminex xTAG RVP Fast v1 assay can detect adenoviruses (ADVs); human bocavirus (HBoV); human coronavirus (CoV) types 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43; influenza A virus (InfA) A/H1N1, InfA/H3N2, and other InfA viruses (non\u2010subtypificable); influenza B virus (InfB); human metapneumovirus (HMPV) A and B; human parainfluenza virus (HPiV) 1, 2, 3, and 4A\u20104B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A\u2010B; and enterovirus/rhinovirus (EvRh). The CLART\u00ae PneumoVir DNA array assay differs from the Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay in that it detects influenza C virus but does not allow the detection of the alphacoronavirus NL63 virus and the betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. The CLART\u00ae PneumoVir is able to discriminate between rhinovirus and enterovirus genus, and it permits the identification of the new influenza A/H1N1v.

A preemptive antiviral therapy approach was used at HCUV to prevent CMV end\u2010organ disease.19 Patients were preemptively treated with oral valganciclovir, i.v. ganciclovir, or i.v. foscarnet upon detection of CMV DNA levels exceeding 1500 IU/mL or a CMV DNA doubling time \u22642 days, as previously reported.19, 20 In turn, a universal prophylaxis strategy was used at HLF until December 2016.21 Briefly, HLA\u2010matched related allo\u2010HSCT recipients were given oral valganciclovir (900 mg/d, three times a week) through day 90 after transplantation.

Interestingly, we observed a trend to poorer outcome of recipients with CARVs LRTD and bacterial co\u2010infections compared to those with bacterial pneumonia mono\u2010infection.

In contrast, we were not able to provide evidence of the clinical usefulness of neither, the ISI score nor the adapted Basel Immunodeficiency grading score, in predicting mortality in multivariate analysis in our pooled CARVs LRTD cohort. Although the ISI, originally designed for RSV, has been validated in influenza virus,32 it is likely that co\u2010infections, not included in the ISI, have hampered its ability to predict outcome in our series. In fact, none of the variables included in the ISI were statistically significant in our uni\u2010 and multivariate model reflecting the weakness of this model in our cohort. This fact suggests that validation of the ISI in other CARVs is warranted before its routine application for therapeutic decision\u2010making. Regarding the Basel Immunodefciency grading score, the fact that we did not include immunoglobulin levelsin the score may have hampered our ability to assess its true value and further validation would be required.12, 13\n",

            "text": "Regarding the analysis of RFs for co\u2010infections during CARVs LRTD our decision of limiting this analysis to bacterial co\u2010infection was justified by 3 main reasons. First, our study showed that bacterial co\u2010infection had a significant negative effect on clinical outcome in contrast to respiratory virus and IA co\u2010infections. Second, there is an increased evidence in the mechanism whereby viral infections enhance and aggravate bacterial co\u2010infection, the former favoring the growth of bacterial agents by multiple factors, including local destruction of antibacterial barriers at epithelial surfaces, suppression of antibacterial immunity, and induction of apoptosis in immune cells.10, 33, 34, 35 Third, RFs for respiratory virus co\u2010infection are expected to be different from those affecting bacterial co\u2010infection since respiratory virus transmission depend upon epidemiologic situation such as the recipients house\u2010hold contacts, contact with children, vaccination status, which has not been captured in our data base. Thus, we identified 2 conditions related with higher incidence of bacterial co\u2010infection; corticosteroids \u22651 mg/kg/d, and CMV DNAemia\u2010RAT. While corticosteroids are a well\u2010recognized RF of profound immunosuppression and then may contribute to bacterial infection in allo\u2010HSCT, this is the first time that CMV DNAemia\u2010RAT was identified as a risk factor for bacterial pneumonia co\u2010infection during CARVs LRTD. CMV is a highly pro\u2010inflammatory and immunosuppressive virus36 and as such it may act synergistically with respiratory virus favoring bacterial growth in the respiratory tract. In addition, CMV readily infects macrophages in vivo, impairing their ability to recognize and eliminate bacteria by phagocytosis.37 Another contributing factor for such observation could be the development of neutropenia\u2010related anti\u2010CMV therapy. Further studies are warranted to confirm such findings since the use of antibiotics in allo\u2010HSCT recipients with CARVs at risk of progression to the LRT with concurrent CMV DNAemia\u2010RAT and/or under corticosteroids therapy may be clinically useful to prevent bacterial pneumonia. Last but not least, we reported that fungal co\u2010infection did not show a negative effect on survival in our cohort. It is likely that the introduction of effective anti\u2010mold drugs from 2007 has overcome the historical bad prognosis of such a complication even in the context of CARV LRTD co\u2010infection.38\n",

In addition, when multiple viruses were detected we were not able to differentiate between infection, shedding, or resolved infection with continued detection. To overcome this limitation, we critically reviewed the radiological patterns at the time of BAL as well as the presence of upper and lower respiratory symptoms ensuring a high degree of CARVs\u2010related cases. Moreover, all BAL samples were homogenously and prospectively tested for CARVs, fungal, and bacterial agents, avoiding the inclusion of cases with PCR retrospectively tested in frozen BAL samples, and this fact should be considered as strength. Regarding the inclusion of several types of CARVs LRTD, that may differ in their pathogenicity, several comparative studies analyzing mortality among different CARVs LRTD showed similar mortality rates7, 8, 39 and could justify our pooled cohort analysis for mortality. In fact, we did not observe significant differences on mortality among the different respiratory viruses in our series, either with or without co\u2010infections. In addition, our data shows an overall mortality rate (35%) comparable among CARVs and in line with several reports,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 39 emphasizing that any CARVs LRTD are still a common life\u2010threatening complication after allo\u2010HSCT.",
