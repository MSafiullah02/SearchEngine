For older people (defined as adults 65 years or older), self-isolation presents particular challenges for physical activity, mental health, and social relationships [2]; continued regulated social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. In this population, physical activity is associated with a greater than 22% reduction in mortality [3]. The implications of social distancing could have unintended adverse mental and physical health outcomes by advancing social isolation, loneliness, and sedentary lifestyles [4].",

As such, governments throughout Europe have implemented various degrees of containment measures to enact social distancing and limit exposure of populations to casual contact to slow the spread of the disease [6]. In Western democracies such as the United Kingdom, governments are finding it challenging to ensure people stay at home during the lockdown and do not exploit the daily exercise and essential shopping rules, especially as the weather starts to improve [6]. Such violations reduce the effectiveness of lockdown measures. There is no practical way of monitoring the status of people with minor symptoms, especially those who are unable to get tested. These patients are not considered in the national statistics and cause the overall patient numbers to be underestimated, making evidence-based policy making unreliable. These circumstances prevent health systems from having accurate information on inbound case numbers, which makes managing case volume challenging and often results in resource overloads.",

Based on data from COVID-19 cases in China, approximately 16% of people aged 60 years or older who become infected are expected to need hospital care [7]. Case fatality rates for people 60 years or older are estimated (from international cases) to be 4.5%, compared to 1.4% for those younger than 60 years [8]. In 2015, 32.1% of the European population was aged 65 and older [9]. Although public health strategies to slow the spread of the disease may prove useful, they also introduce a burden of social isolation at home and in the hospital. Even before COVID-19, older people\u2014particularly those who spend the majority of their time alone\u2014were at a higher risk of social isolation [10,11]. Social isolation\u2014having few social interactions\u2014has been linked to an increased risk for a range of physical and mental health problems, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, dementia, and depression [11]. Loneliness, the subjective perception of inadequate social connection, has also been independently associated with depressive symptoms [2,10,12]. The current limitations on social contact exacerbate the vulnerability of older people to social isolation, loneliness, and the associated mental and physical effects on well-being.",

The challenge with each of these approaches is, although they may be useful in establishing baseline contact, they are generic approaches that are not customized to the nature of the current problem. Additionally, systems often have a limited theoretical basis in evidence-based health behavior change frameworks. Many families are attempting to use social media platforms (eg, Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Zoom) to connect with older members of their families [14]. However, these platforms were not designed to address the needs of older users in both application and user experience, and have limited functions. Prevention of social isolation can be achieved through one-on-one communication, group interactions, and structural interventions; although the sustainability of intervention is a crucial factor in long-term effectiveness [11].",

Design standards that would promote interoperability necessary to integrate patient-facing and hospital-wise care systems are still emerging [17].

Effective interventions can be developed by evaluating which of these components need to be changed and how to achieve a target behavior [20]. The BCW framework also links these behavioral components with various intervention strategies (eg, persuasion, education) so that intervention types can be chosen concerning the behavioral components to be changed [20]. This framework will be used as a basis for evaluating what is preventing individuals from engaging in digital social interactions, physical activity, and symptom reporting so that the interventions incorporated in the mobile app will target those aspects specifically. The behavior change techniques (BCT) taxonomy will also be used to provide a clear description of the specific techniques being used in the app [21]. The clarity that this taxonomy provides will enable easy and rapid evaluation and adaptation of the BCTs used in the app in response to interim data so that the app will use the most effective BCTs in this context.",

It is challenging for academic institutions and funders to react responsively, particularly in medicine, because systems are designed to follow structures that ensure safety and evidence-based practice, which by their very design are methodical and time intensive. Despite these institutional barriers, however, the international clinical, academic, and industrial community have responded with speed during this crisis. The key lessons learned will be long-term enablement of what has worked for agile solution delivery and how we can embed these practices in care delivery in the future.",
