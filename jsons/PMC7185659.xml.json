Currently, no coherent action is taken to address the problem. In 2002, the University Medical Center, Utrecht, founded the Strategic Council on Antibiotic resistance in Europe (SCORE) to ascertain the current situation and provide a roadmap to curb antibiotic resistance in Europe. To achieve those goals, SCORE organized several symposia attended by European experts on antibiotic resistance, including microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and pharmaceutical industry scientists. These meetings, a questionnaire on antibiotic resistance, a continuous flow of comments and suggestions via e-mail, publicly available reports and literature have been summarized in a widely supported and consensus-based report (Verhoef et al., 2004). This review is based on the SCORE report, recent information from literature and data from major European surveillance networks. In contrast to reports on antibiotic resistance which generally cover a single topic in the field, this review aims to demonstrate the complexity of resistance; identify the main factors involved; propose adequate measures to contain resistance on a European scale.",

This has been a miscalculation. Today, infectious diseases are back in the spotlight and antimicrobial resistance increasingly hampers successful therapy. In the case of bacterial infections, problems are being encountered with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), multiresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, multiresistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, intrinsically multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii, and multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae, including extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-positive strains (ESBL). In spite of a great geographical variation in resistance levels, antibiotic resistance is clearly rising in major human pathogens (Fig. 1\n). A resistance level of 10% against an empirically used antibiotic has been proposed as a guide to switch therapy (Gemmell et al., 2006, Noone, 1978). Therefore, extrapolation of the antibiotic resistance trends in Fig. 1 predicts that empirical therapy against these pathogens becomes problematic in the near future.",

            "text": "\nS. aureus is a common human pathogen by virtue of being part of the normal skin flora. One of the greatest concerns with regard to antibiotic resistance is MRSA. The first MRSA emerged shortly after the introduction of \u03b2-lactamase-stable penicillins, such as methicillin, in the early 1960s. However, it was in the late 1970s that series of epidemic MRSA strains evolved and have since spread throughout hospitals in the world. In the 1990s, community-associated (CA) MRSA emerged, which has now rapidly spread both in the hospitals and the community as documented by molecular epidemiological studies involving pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (Kollef and Micek, 2006, Zetola et al., 2005). PFGE is a suitable tool to investigate MRSA outbreaks because of its high discriminatory power (Robinson and Enright, 2004). CA MRSA strains are a threat to healthy individuals too as they typically carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidine toxin, which is associated with necrotising pneumonia (Genestier et al., 2005). The complete genome sequence of an epidemic CA MRSA clone, USA300, which is a major source of community-acquired infections in the USA, Canada, and Europe, revealed the presence of an additional virulence element, named arginine catabolic mobile element that encodes an arginine deiminase pathway and an oligopeptide permease system that could contribute to the fitness of that clone (Diep et al., 2006).",

Five types of SCCmec have been described. SCCmec I, II and III are associated with HA MRSA, whereas SCCmec type IV and V are mainly found in CA MRSA. Since SCCmec IV and V do not contain any resistance genes except for mecA, CA MRSA are less multi-resistant than HA MRSA (Hanssen and Ericson Sollid, 2006). Remarkably, in the US strains USA 400 (Sequence Type 1) and USA 300 (Sequence Type 8) are the most predominant CA MRSA, whereas in Australia and Europe mainly Sequence Type 30 and Type 80 are found, respectively (Chambers, 2005, Vandenesch et al., 2003).",

Given the documented treatment failures with penicillin (although rare), macrolides and quinolones, cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are recommended for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia (Peterson, 2006).

Recently, resistance against daptomycin was reported (Long et al., 2005). Increasing numbers of severely ill patients in combination with increased use of these agents may fuel the clinical importance of multi-resistant enterococci. Enterococcus faecium is considered less pathogenic and is less frequently isolated than Enterococcus faecalis, but is nevertheless a growing clinical problem because of its potential to develop resistance against multiple antibiotics including linezolid (Bonora et al., 2006).

However, based on the estimates presented above, the annual cost of MRSA bacteraemia alone would already exceed the total European Union budget for antimicrobial resistance research from 1999 to 2002 (European Commission, 2003). Even worse, extrapolation of current, rising trends in antimicrobial resistance suggests that the real problems are still ahead of us. The worst case scenario, i.e. the emergence of fully antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms leading to a situation similar to the pre-antimicrobial era, would have an enormous impact on human suffering and large financial consequences, even if it concerns only a fraction of the common microorganisms within the hospitals or the community.

Despite many difficulties, much can be gained by combining efforts to institute broad surveillance networks. However, initiating new surveillance programs is costly.

Consequently, the modification of antibiotic consumption may be an important way to influence the incidence and prevalence of resistant bacteria. Since the emergence of resistance is intrinsically linked to the use of antibiotics, complete prevention of resistance is impossible. As defined by the Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance, \u2018prudent use of antibiotics encourages maximal therapeutic impact while minimizing toxicity and the development of resistance\u2019 (2001). Prudent use, therefore, does not simply imply reduction in antibiotic consumption, but prevention of misuse and overuse. In this way, the life span of a single antibiotic can be extended, allowing more time for the development of new antibiotics and the implementation of other approaches to combat antimicrobial resistance. Prudent use of antibiotics may be especially important when resistance levels are still low, as the decline in resistance after treatment cessation is much slower than its emergence. The persistence of resistance may depend on the fitness cost of resistance and on the linkage of multiple resistance genes on mobile elements (Andersson, 2003).",

The general public and farmers, who are often large-scale users of antimicrobial agents, politicians and healthcare workers, often have limited knowledge about the extent of the antibiotic-resistance problem and are generally not fully aware of the problems associated with antibiotic use. Medical microbiologists and infectious disease specialists play a central role in this education. However, even though the Union of European Medical Specialists has drawn up a Training Record & Training Program for candidates to be trained in medical microbiology and the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) organizes courses for trainees from all over Europe, the training of these specialists is not harmonized within the EU (Grundmann and Goossens, 2005). This lack of harmonization has led to different opinions about the problem of antibiotic resistance. Harmonization can be achieved by providing scientific evidence. Therefore, monitoring of antibiotic consumption in combination with surveillance is necessary to acquire more insight into the complex interaction between antibiotic use and resistance. The data obtained should also be used for feedback to the prescribers to influence behaviour and to increase public awareness. Computer-assisted decision support programs for antimicrobial prescription may aid the physician in accurate antibiotic prescription. In combination with local surveillance data on antimicrobial susceptibility, programs can be tailor made to advice on empiric drug use on a local level. Promising results have been reported on stabilizing or reducing antibiotic resistance with such decision support programs (Burke and Pestotnik, 1999, Sintchenko et al., 2005).",

An economic concept that deals with future societal costs of antibiotic use, is the \u201cper dose annual loss\u201d. This loss can be regarded as a virtual price tag, expressing the future societal costs for each single antibiotic prescription. The cost for society is due to increased antimicrobial resistance, which may lead to the use of more expensive antibiotics, increased hospitalisation, morbidity and mortality. This virtual price tag depends on the relation between antibiotic use and resistance, and the annual impact of resistance (Phelps, 1989). An antibiotic price tag may provide an indication for the magnitude of the resistance problem in relation to antibiotic use, and provides a handle to measure the cost-effectiveness of measures to promote prudent use of antibiotics.",

In 2004, the Dutch Working Party on Infection Prevention issued a guideline for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of highly resistant pathogens. The guideline provides a specific definition for highly resistant microorganisms, which are human pathogens that have the potential to spread in the hospital and have acquired antimicrobial resistance hampering (empirical) therapy. Depending on the class of highly resistant microorganism, specific isolation measures, active surveillance and contact tracing is conducted (Kluytmans-Vandenbergh et al., 2005).

Countries that use this policy, The Netherlands and Scandinavia, have a low MRSA prevalence, which is an indication for the success of this approach (Wertheim et al., 2004). But this policy is costly and there is little evidence about the necessity and efficacy of its individual components. Mathematical models suggest that a subset of measures may suffice to control MRSA prevalence in low-endemic settings. The models indicate that in a high-endemic setting appropriate measures can reduce MRSA levels (Bootsma et al., 2006, Pan et al., 2005). A serious threat to the feasibility of this policy is the emergence of MRSA in the community, as this may have huge consequences for the capacity of a hospital to screen and isolate patients in order to maintain the search and destroy strategy. Nevertheless, a search-and-destroy strategy should be considered for new pathogen-resistance combinations, such as VRSA.",

Large pharmaceutical companies are moving away from the field of antibiotic development (Shlaes, 2003). There are several reasons for this worrisome phenomenon. The development of a new antibiotic costs about \u20ac500 million, takes 10\u201315 years and yields a product that is used for brief periods against targets that are prone to develop resistance. In addition, new drugs face restricting policies towards their use. How can incentives be improved for companies to reinvest in antibiotic development? Several measures can be considered, such as a faster registration process for new \u201clast-resort antibiotics\u201d (Abraham, 2002), patent extension, joined non-profit research platforms (Nathan, 2004), subsidies and tax-incentives (Nathan and Goldberg, 2005).

These targets may comprise essential genes, for which loss of function is lethal for the bacterium, and accessory genes, such as virulence genes. Using structural biology and combinatorial chemistry, libraries of lead compounds can be generated and examined on their interaction with the bacterial target. In theory, this genomics-based approach allows the rational design of antibiotics against novel, broad-spectrum targets to reduce the probability of emerging resistance (Chalker and Lunsford, 2002). In practice, however, translating lead compounds into novel drugs has had limited success so far. The technology is still at its infancy and to date not a single marketed antibacterial agent has been discovered by this approach. Major bottlenecks are generating sufficient variants of a lead compound and predicting and improving efficacy and toxicity (Hughes, 2003). Another limitation of the genomics-based approach is that it yields protein targets only, whereas some of the most important classes of antibiotics such as glycopeptides act on non-protein targets.",

In 1999, the Council of the European Union issued a statement that antimicrobial resistance requires a cohesive approach at a European level (Bronzwaer et al., 2004). Since Europe shares the consequences of antimicrobial resistance, it should also share the efforts to contain the problem. Given the global dimensions and the complexity of the problem, a concerted approach is needed. Hence the subsidiarity principle, which states that action is required only when the European approach is proven superior to the national approach, warrants implementation of a strong European policy against antibiotic resistance.",

Surveillance actions are to strengthen surveillance networks at the European level for both antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption data. Prevention actions include educational campaigns, infection prevention programs (in particular vaccination) and reduction of antibiotic self-medication. The research actions should encourage the development of new antimicrobial agents, alternative treatments (vaccines) and rapid and reliable diagnostic tests. Finally, the EU seeks international co-operation, especially with the WHO, to promote rational use of antibiotics (Bronzwaer et al., 2004).

However, the public awareness remains low, as is the European budget to address this complex issue. The \u2018guestimates\u2019 on the surplus economic costs of MRSA bacteremia suggest that these annual costs alone already exceed the total European Union budget for antimicrobial resistance research for 1999\u20132002 (European Commission, 2003). Sufficient political resolve to implement effective counter-measures is crucial to tackle the resistance problem. An important prerequisite is to increase the public awareness of the resistance problem and to put it higher on European and national political agendas. This is hampered by the lack of quantitative data on the impact of resistance on public health. Hence, the first priority is to obtain these data (Fig. 3\n). Although new classes of antibiotics are definitely needed, economic and scientific obstacles may hamper their development for the next 15 years. Thus, the focus should be on measures that prolong the life of current (and new) antibiotics. For these intervention strategies, research is needed that can be translated into evidence-based guidelines to be implemented by the EU. Finally, much more fundamental knowledge is required to understand the spread and fitness of resistant bacteria at a genetic level. Based on these arguments, the essential areas of research can be prioritized as follows:(a)Determine the burden of resistance in terms of mortality and economic impact.(b)Determine the most effective infection-prevention and antibiotic-use measures to curb resistance.(c)Develop improved technologies and/or alternative strategies to acquire new classes of antibiotics, and alternatives like immune-enhancing compounds.(d)Examine fitness (resistance and virulence genes) and spread (clonal, horizontal transfer) of resistant microbes among different resistance reservoirs including hospitals, the community, and the veterinary sector.\n",

Whereas medical experts seem willing to tackle the problem (Verhoef et al., 2004), political willingness to provide the incentives and necessary legislation is crucial to curb resistance. A more thorough understanding on the societal impact of antibiotic resistance, both in clinical and economic terms, is essential to set the priorities.

Only a very limited number of (broad-spectrum) targets may exist. A \u2018compound-based\u2019 approach aims at identifying new lead compounds by means of screening compound libraries or human, bacterial or phage peptides with functional in vitro assays. In principle, small molecules are better drug candidates than, for example peptides. Thus, the resulting targets, small molecules and peptides have to be translated into (non-protein) lead compounds.

Antibiotic development implies the need for better technologies in order to develop new antibiotics and alternative strategies. Antibiotic use refers to prudent use in the hospitals, restricted use in the community (i.e. better compliance with the prohibition of over-the-counter sales of antibiotics), and therapeutic use only in the veterinary sector. Standardized evidence-based guidelines and education programs for healthcare professionals and the public are needed to implement intervention measures. Well-designed standardized surveillance programs are needed to study the cost-effectiveness of intervention measures in the hospital, the community, and other resistance reservoirs such as the veterinary sector. Resistance levels, in turn, should be linked to relevant outcome parameters like mortality, morbidity, economic costs of resistance, and cost-effectiveness of intervention measures. Finally, resistance dynamics should be analysed in relation to intervention measures using mathematical modelling, and the spread and mechanisms of resistance should be addressed by coupling resistance data to the genetic background of the strains.",
