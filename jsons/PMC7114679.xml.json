            "text": "Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped viruses associated mainly with enteric and respiratory diseases in mammals and birds. The round and sometimes pleomorphic coronavirion, 80 to 120 nm in diameter, contains a linear, positive-strand RNA molecule, which is complexed with the highly basic nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) to form a helical capsid found within the viral envelope. The coronavirus membranes contain at least three viral proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins. The S glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to specific cell receptors and fusion between the envelope and plasma membrane and it is the main inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies. The E protein plays an important role in viral envelope assembly, but it is not essential for virus propagation. The M protein, the most abundant structural component, is a type III glycoprotein consisting of a short amino-terminal ectodomain, a triple-spanning transmembrane domain, and a long carboxyl-terminal inner domain. Some coronaviruses possess an additional structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), closely related to the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein of influenza C virus.10\n",

The 5\u2032-most two thirds of the genome comprise the replicase gene, which consists of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and 1b. Located downstream of ORF1b are up to 11 ORFs that code for the 4 common structural proteins and a variable set of accessory proteins. Number, nucleotide sequence, and order of these additional genes can vary remarkably among different coronaviruses. The function of the accessory proteins is in most cases unknown. Albeit not essential for virus replication, they play an important role in virus\u2013host interactions because they are generally maintained during natural infection, and their loss\u2014either through spontaneous mutation or reversed genetics\u2014results in reduced virulence.10\n",

CCoV was included in phylogroup 1, together with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) type I and type II, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV-229E) and NL63 (HCoV-NL63).10 Subsequently, a ferret coronavirus11 and viruses identified in bats12 were proposed as tentative members of this group. Recently, the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses accepted the proposal of the Coronavirus Study Group to revise the family Coronaviridae to include the corona- and toroviruses as subfamilies (Corona- and Torovirinae) and to convert the coronavirus phylogroups 1, 2, and 3 into genera (Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively).1 The new taxonomy is based upon rooted phylogeny and quantitative pairwise sequence comparison and includes a clear definition of coronavirus species demarcation in accordance with that used in other virus families. Given their close genetic relatedness (>96% amino acid identity in the key replicase 1ab domains), TGEV, CCoV, and FCoV are now considered not as separate viruses but rather as host range variants of the same species, Alphacoronavirus-1.",

Serologic and virologic investigations demonstrated that CCoV is widespread in the dog population, and the virus is highly prevalent in kennels and animal shelters.5 Enteric CCoV infection is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality. The virus is shed at high titers in the feces and transmitted via the fecal\u2013oral route. CCoV infection is generally restricted to the alimentary tract, leading to the onset of clinical signs typical of gastroenteritis including loss of appetite, vomiting, fluid diarrhea, dehydration, and, only very rarely, death.5 Although, in general, CCoV does not cause systemic disease, the virus has been isolated from several tissues (tonsils, lungs, and liver) of experimentally infected pups.20 Fatal disease commonly occurs as a consequence of mixed infections of CCoV with canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2),21, 22 with canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1)23 or with canine distemper virus (CDV).24\n",

In contrast, methods based on nucleic acid amplification are highly sensitive, even in the presence of low amounts of viral RNA. Several RT-PCR assays have been developed to detect CCoV in fecal specimens,46, 47, 48 the majority of which can be easily conducted on RNA extract from internal organs.",

According to this scenario, dogs vaccinated with enteric CCoV may acquire subclinical infections with pantropic CCoV resulting in lymphopenia that may represent a predisposing factor for opportunistic pathogens and for a more severe disease induced by \u201ctrue\u201d pathogens (CPV, CAdV, CDV, and others).",

To date, two genotypes of CCoV have been described, CCoV-I and CCoV-II, with the latter including two different subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb. Usually, CCoV causes mild to severe diarrhea in pups, whereas fatal infections have been associated mainly with concurrent infections by other canine pathogens. However, a few years ago, an outbreak of fatal, systemic disease caused by a highly virulent CCoV-II strain (CB/05) was reported. To date, pantropic CCoV outbreaks have occurred in different parts of Europe, with clinical presentations and post mortem findings similar to those observed in the first outbreak. The pantropic CCoV-induced disease was also reproduced under experimental conditions, although the most prominent finding was a severe, long-lasting lymphopenia (mainly associated to a dramatic reduction of CD4+ cells), rather than the death of the infected pups. Lacking any specific vaccine against this emerging pathogen of dogs, further studies should carefully evaluate (1) the worldwide distribution of the virus in dog populations and (2) the efficacy of existing vaccines, based on enteric CCoV, against pantropic viruses.",
