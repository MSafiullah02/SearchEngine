The SH ectodomain is only weakly immunogenic [4, 9]. In infected cells, SH protein accumulates mostly in lipid rafts of the Golgi and of the endoplasmic reticulum [3]. It is a viroporin, forming a transmembrane pentameric ring that functions as a channel for cations and small molecules [10, 11]. HRSV SH protein blocks or delays apoptosis through inhibition of the TNF-\u03b1 signalling pathway [12] but the mechanism is still not fully elucidated.",

Following our previous analysis of HVR2 sequences of strains detected within a limited geographical area (the Zagreb region) and limited time frame (March 2011 to March 2014) [16], the goal of this study was to investigate whether virus variability and inter-genotype differences observed for HVR2 are also present in the SH gene. Within this pool of viruses, rapid and significant genetic changes have occurred in HVR2 [16]. The subset of strains analysed in this research belong to 3 HRSV A (NA1, ON1 and GA5) and 2 HRSV B genotypes (BA9 and BA10) and it included all the genotypes that were detected in Zagreb, 03/2011\u201303/2014.

In group B, a deletion of an adenosine in poly A tail was observed (position 4626\u20134630 in reference to the consensus sequence B1).

Deletion of 2 nts at the beginning of the SH-G intergenic region in GA5 strains, preceded by 6 adenosines1 was found in 100% of our GA5 strains and only in GA5 genotype (and therefore could be classified as genotype specific). Our viral pool contained only 3 GA5 strains, identical in both HVR2 and SHseg and all collected in February 2014. Therefore we searched for other HRSV sequences that possess AAAAAAGTCA at the end of SH 3\u2019 UTR and beginning of SH-G intergenic region in NCBI database. Fourteen sequences were retrieved and all belong to genotype GA5 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).",

E.g. in analyses based on HVR2, ON1 and NA1 strains are placed on different branches, even when one copy of the duplicated segment is excluded from the analysis [23]. Still, basing molecular epidemiology studies only on HVR2 may be quite misleading. In our pool of HRSV strains, over 20% of them would be incorrectly assumed to be identical to another strain if only the HVR2 region was analysed. An alternative HRSV genotyping scheme has recently been proposed [24], based on the complete G protein ectodomainwhich is twice longer than HVR2. Although this would increase the discrimination between strains, it is still focused solely on one protein gene. The G gene is non-representative of the HRSV genome, as it is marked by elevated substitution rates (attributed to relaxed selective constraints [25]) and a flip-flop substitution pattern [26]. Broadening the target genome sequence to SH (whose length in our analysis was 401\u2013411 nts in group A, 412 or 413 in group B) or only to SH 5\u2019 UTR (in our analysis, this was a region of 83 or 84 nts in group A, 85 in group B) would provide better insight into the interrelation between molecular epidemiology and molecular and evolutionary dynamics.",

Although group A and group B strains diverged approximately 350 years ago [27], the majority of amino acids which differ from the consensus in group A have the same identity as corresponding amino acids in group B strains. This indicates that the variability of the SH protein is not only low, but is also restricted. Based on the fact that HVR2 has the highest evolutionary rates, we concentrated on strains possessing the same HVR2 nucleotide sequences, but still differing in their SH protein sequences. Those are the strains most likely to be highly similar and therefore we hypothesized that the observed differences could be a result of selective pressure. Out of 4 sets of strains with differences in the SH ectodomain, in 3 sets the differences were in SH protein region 49\u201351. In fact, besides S35F the only amino acid differences observed in group A strains which differed from the group B consensus, were located within 49\u201351 region. In our viral pool, which was very limited both geographically and temporally, 6.7% of group A strains and 51.3% of group B strains possessed mutation in region 49\u201351.",

Besides finding T49I variability (as observed by us), P and A at position 49 were also reported among group B strains. Chen et al. [29] detected variability in the same region in American HRSV strains from 1998 to 1999 [29]. In group A, the most common amino acid at position 49 was V (the same as in our analysis), but I was also observed.

The deletion was found only in this strain that caused a bronchiolitis in a 2-month-old child. The deletion was confirmed by 3 independent RNA isolations and preparations of DNA for sequencing. During the same HRSV epidemic, strain RSV3234\u201312 (from November 2012) was detected in a sample from a 4-month-old child with bronchiolitis. The two strains are identical in the SH, G an F genes, except for the fact that RSV3234\u201312 does not possess this deletion in the SH gene. Other genomic regions were not sequenced. In group A strains, H51 (which is missing from RSV5\u201313) is a crucial residue in the regulation of SH ion channel activity [30]. Together with H22, H51 plays a key role in the opening and closing mechanism of the SH pentameric pore, since they are located in strategic places within the chains, close to the N- and C-termini [30, 31]. An alternative amino acid at position 51 (Y, a non-basic amino acid) has been reported before, in a Brazilian GA5 strain from 2004 [28], but so far there were no reports of the deletion observed in RSV5\u201313. In vitro experiments regarding the functionality of the SH protein from RSV5\u201313 or modelling studies that would compare its structure to other HRSV SH proteins have not been performed.",
