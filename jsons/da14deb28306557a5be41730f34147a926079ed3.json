Methods: A stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19 was utilised. It was populated with data for the case study island nation of New Zealand (NZ) along with relevant parameters sourced from the NZ and international literature. This included a testing level for symptomatic cases of 7,800 tests per million people per week. Results: It was estimated to take between 27 and 33 days of no new detected cases for there to be a 95% probability of epidemic extinction. This was for effective reproduction numbers (Re) in the range of 0.50 to 1.0, which encompass such controls as case isolation (the shorter durations relate to low Re values). For a 99% probability of epidemic extinction, the equivalent time period was 37 to 44 days. In scenarios with lower levels of symptomatic cases seeking medical attention and lower levels of testing, the time period was up to 53 to 91 days (95% level).",

It could also permit quarantine-free travel with other COVID-19 free nations, as envisaged by the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand in terms of a trans-Tasman \"bubble\". 3 Similarly, the leaders of Austria, Greece, Israel, Norway, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand \"agreed that as each begins to ease restrictions they could capitalise on low infection rates by creating tourism safe zones\". 4 We selected New Zealand as a case study island nation as it has an elimination goal, 1 has good border controls and is making steady progress towards elimination with occasional days in May 2020 with no new cases reported. 5 Some work has already been done on the elimination topic in New Zealand, with a modelling group 6 reporting that a \"90 day period at Level 4 [intensive lock-down restrictions] leads to containment to very low levels by the end of the 90 day period\". \"This scenario leads to elimination in approximately 50% of stochastic realisations\". Another study 7 estimated the probability that regions within New Zealand might have achieved elimination, with the District Health Board region with the highest number of days free of notified cases (Wairarapa at 16 days as of 18 April 2020) having a 92% probability of having eliminated the pandemic virus. However, none of this work has defined time periods for differing levels of probability for elimination being achieved at a whole country level. Estimating these periods was therefore the aim of this simulation study.",

The level of testing of symptomatic cases in primary care and for respiratory cases being tested when hospitalised (both at 95% coverage with test sensitivity of 89% 11 ), was as per a fairly optimal surveillance system conducting 7,800 tests per million people per week (slightly less than the level in New Zealand as per mid-May 2020 at 8, 190 tests per million people per week 12 ).

Starting the simulations with 100 or 1000 initially infected cases instead of 10, made no meaningful difference ( Figure 2 ). This was expected because while there are 1000 or 100 infected individuals in the population, the frequency of very short case-free intervals of up to a few days at most are very frequent whereas long case free intervals of weeks are virtually impossible. Only after the number of cases has dropped to very low numbers, case-free periods of weeks may occasionally occur despite ongoing transmission. Also only for such long case-free periods is there an ambiguity whether extinction has occurred or not, whereas nobody would assume that extinction has occurred if no cases have been reported for two or three days. .

Figure 2 : Probability that pandemic virus extinction has occurred according to different numbers of initial cases and testing proportions. The chart shows extinction probabilities if no new COVID-19 cases have been detected for a given number of days (effective reproduction number Re=0.8; 10,000 simulations each scenario). The three black curves on the left (nearly undistinguishable) give the results obtained when starting the simulations with 10 (solid), 100 (dotted) or 1,000 (dashed) infections, respectively. The dark grey curve shows the result when only 30% of COVID-19 patients seek medical attention and only 60% of them are tested (Scenario 1). The light grey curve on the right shows the result when only 20% seek medical attention and only 30% of them are tested (Scenario 2).",

A 28 day period for elimination has also been proposed for the Australian setting. 2 Nevertheless, it is possible that the 99% level of probability provides a better safety margin (ie, the 37 to 44 day period we have estimated).

In each simulation, the sum of all the rates that change the current state of the system is calculated as \uf028 \uf029 is chosen, and the first transition in the order whose cumulative rate is larger than 2 r is performed. If, for example, the event is an infection, one individual is removed from the group of susceptible individuals and added to the group of latent individuals of stage 1.
