In the European Union, there are between 40,000 and 220,000 annual deaths attributable to influenza. However, mortality is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the disease burden, since influenza also causes a decrease in functional status and increased dependency in the elderly [1]. Estimating the burden of disease caused by influenza is difficult because many cases do not require medical care, or no confirmatory laboratory tests are widely performed to all influenza like illness\u2019 cases [2, 3].",

SHLCIC was defined as a severe case of laboratory-confirmed influenza due to the influenza virus (A, A (H1N1)pdm09, B, C) that required hospitalization because of pneumonia, septic shock, multiorgan failure or any other severe condition, including ICU admission or who developed clinical signs during hospitalization for other reasons. Influenza diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or culture of nasopharyngeal swabs. Respiratory tract samples were processed within 24 h of receipt at the laboratory. A 300 \u03bcL aliquot was taken for total nucleic acids extraction and eluted in 25 \u03bcL of RNase-free elution buffer using the automatic QIAsymphony system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Subsequently, two specific one-step multiplex real-time PCR was carried out using the Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR Systems (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), were used for typing A/B influenza virus and subtyping influenza A virus [8, 9].",

Predominant influenza type/subtype circulating each season, influenza vaccination policies and coverage, influenza vaccine strain match/mismatch and vaccine effectiveness significantly influence the % of hospitalised influenza cases and CFRs in all age groups, including older age groups. However, the high percentage of hospitalizations (45.2%) and mortality (17.5%) in the \u2265 65 years age group, especially in people aged > 80 years, where mortality is higher (33.3%), reflect the consequences of increased life expectancy. Early administration of antiviral treatment has proven to diminish length of stay. Healthcare providers should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible, before 48 h from onset of symptoms is the recommendation, [11] unfortunately this is not feasible. Yet if treated as soon as patient is admitted to the hospital facility and influenza is confirmed, shorter length of stay and prompt recovery can be attained [12, 13].",
