There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19.

EIDD-1931 has a variety of antiviral activities against numerous causal agents of deleterious viral infectious diseases, including influenza, chikungunya, Ebola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and coronavirus-associated diseases (Agostini et al., 2019; Painter et al., 2019; Reynard et al., 2015; Toots et al., 2019) . As a ribonucleotide analog, EIDD-1931 shares similar mechanisms of action with remdesivir and exerts antiviral effects by mimicking a ribonucleotide, thereby mistakenly being incorporated into viral RNA, leading to lethal mutagenesis during virion RNA synthesis and inhibiting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus during viral replication (Fig. 2) Sheahan et al., 2020) . The study suggested that EIDD-1931 robustly blocked the replication of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 in cell assays.

Unfortunately, ACE2 is also a functional receptor of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) and SARS-CoV-2 . The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binds to the host ACE2 receptor and then enters target cells (Fig. 2) . Critically, SARS-CoV-2 shows higher affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Moreover, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a site that can be recognized and activated by a host enzyme called furin, which is highly expressed in the lungs (Coutard et al., 2020) . These findings might provide strong evidence for the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the pivotal role of widely distributed ACE2 in the entry and replication of viruses, blocking S protein binding to ACE2 might offer some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 163, "text": "(Li et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 370, "end": 390, "text": "(Wrapp et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 554, "end": 576, "text": "(Coutard et al., 2020)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 299, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 850, "end": 858, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "Spike Protein-Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Blockers"}, {"text": "A study using a murine model of SARS showed that SARS-CoV S protein binding to ACE2 led to RAS downregulation and consequently contributed to severe lung injury .

Clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety of rhACE2 application (Haschke et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2017) . A recent in vitro study demonstrated that the fusion protein of rhACE2 with an Fc fragment shows high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 . Additionally, the findings from a newly online published report in Cell were strongly supportive of potential efficacy of rhACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Monteil et al., 2020) . The study showed that clinical-grade human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) displayed potently inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures and in engineered replicas of human blood vessels and kidneys in a dose-dependent manner. The researchers found that before infecting cells, SARS-CoV-2 co-incubated with hrsACE2, rather than mouse recombinant soluble ACE2, demonstrated dropped activity to infect cells. In the organoid level, administration of hrsACE2 significantly blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in both engineered human blood vessels and kidneys without observed toxicity. However, note that this study focused on the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still unclear whether hrsACE2 can play a role in the later infection process.

Despite the long history of administering corticosteroids, their therapeutic effectiveness and safety remains controversial. Several clinical trials and meta-analyses have indicated that corticosteroids are associated with increased mortality, a tendency for requiring mechanical ventilation therapy, and relatively longer hospitalizations for SARS, MERS, and H1N1 infections (Arabi et al., 2018; Han et al., 2011; Stockman et al., 2006) .
