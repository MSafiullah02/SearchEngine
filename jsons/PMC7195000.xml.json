Common symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to those of SARS-CoV infection and include respiratory signs, cough, fever, dyspnea and breathing issues. In complicated cases, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), renal failure and death are observed [1].",

Activation of RhoA GTPase and its downstream effector, Rho kinase (ROCK), contributes to a burst in inflammatory features, immune cell migration, apoptosis, coagulation, contraction, and cell adhesion in pulmonary endothelial cells, leading to endothelium barrier dysfunction and edema as hallmarks of lung injury. Importantly, Rho kinase inhibitors such as fasudil, could significantly attenuate lung injury in different in vivo and in vitro models of ALI. Furthermore, excellent anti-fibrotic effects of Rho kinase inhibitors were shown in models of pulmonary fibrosis [3].",

ACE2 is widely expressed in alveolar epithelial cells and makes angiotensin II which is a negative regulator of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system, inactive. Since ACE2 opposes the actions of angiotensin II, it exerts beneficial effects against diseases such as lung injury, hypertension and cardiac remodeling. Envelope spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates its attachment and fusion into the human cells through binding ACE2 with super-affinity and efficiency. In a mice model, it was documented that SARS-CoV suppresses ACE2 protein by binding via its spike protein, producing severe lung injury. Also, recombinant ACE2 protein protected mice in a model of acid aspiration or sepsis-induced ALI. Accordingly, considering ACE2 as a potential therapeutic target in severe acute respiratory syndrome of COVID-19 was strongly suggested [4,5,6].",

It should be noted that although several other agents are also able to inhibit virus cell entry, Rho kinase inhibitors can suppress pathways involved in lung tissue destruction.
