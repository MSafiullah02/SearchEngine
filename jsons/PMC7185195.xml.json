These fields are predominantly of low frequency (60 Hz in the USA, 50 Hz in Europe and Japan) and generally of low intensity. Electric fields exist when there is electric potential in a line, while magnetic fields exist only when there is current flow (1). Since both electric and magnetic fields often occur together and are interactive, these fields have often been referred to as electric and magnetic fields, or EMFs. Trees, walls and other objects shield electric fields while magnetic fields usually penetrate non-ferrous material. Thus, most residential exposure is to magnetic fields. Recent research has focused on potential adverse health effects of exposure to magnetic fields. Most homes have magnetic field intensities of <2 mG or 0.2 \u03bcT, although some areas in homes may exceed this. In some industries, mean workplace magnetic field exposure may exceed 10 mG (2).",

Further concern was raised by a report of a modest increase in breast cancer in women with magnetic field exposure (5). Even a small effect of EMF on the incidence of breast cancer in women has potential major health implications. The suggestion that magnetic field exposure may depress nocturnal melatonin levels (6) provided a plausible mechanism for magnetic fields to increase breast cancer rates.",

Other reports from a laboratory in Hannover, Germany suggested that 50 Hz magnetic fields may promote 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary gland cancer in female rats (10\u201316). In an attempt to confirm whether magnetic fields could promote breast cancer in rats, we used a DMBA initiation/promotion model in Sprague\u2013Dawley rats with magnetic field exposure similar to conditions used in studies from the Hannover laboratory. We used repeated administration of the initiating chemical with four weekly doses of 5 mg DMBA (total 20 mg DMBA/rat) followed by 13 weeks of magnetic field promotion to test potential promoting effects of these fields on breast cancer. When this regimen caused >90% tumors in the exposure and control groups, a second study using a lower dose of DMBA (8 mg total) following the same repeated administration of the initiating chemical was conducted. We also added the American power line frequency (60 Hz) in addition to 50 Hz for the magnetic field exposures.",

Pairs of coils were stacked one above the other; the bottom coils produced horizontal magnetic fields in one direction while the top coils produced magnetic fields opposite to that of the lower coils. This arrangement helped minimize stray fields. The wires in the coils were embedded in plastic to minimize coil vibration and hum and the plastic cases of the coils could be cleaned without danger of harming the electrical hardware.",

On day 1 of the study, four groups of 100 female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were administered 5 mg DMBA dissolved in 1 ml of sesame oil by gavage. Three additional weekly doses of 5 mg DMBA were administered by gavage. Of the four groups administered DMBA, one group received no magnetic field exposure and served as a DMBA control group. Three groups of rats administered DMBA were exposed to magnetic fields at intensities/frequencies of 1 G, 50 Hz, 5 G, 50 Hz or 1 G, 60 Hz for 18.5 h/day, 7 days/week for 13 weeks. An additional 100 female rats were administered 1 ml of sesame oil on day 1 of the study and three additional doses in succeeding weeks. These rats received no magnetic field exposure and served as a vehicle control group. In a second 13 week study, three groups of 100 female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were administered 2 mg DMBA dissolved in 1 ml of sesame oil by gavage. Three additional weekly doses of 2 mg DMBA were administered by gavage in corn oil. Of the three groups administered DMBA, one group received no magnetic field exposure, one group 1 G, 50 Hz and one group 5 G, 50 Hz magnetic field exposures. Rats were weighed prior to study start, weekly thereafter and again at necropsy. The rats were palpated weekly; masses were located by specific mammary gland (L1\u2013L6 and R1\u2013R6). Two individuals each palpated half of the rats, alternating groups of rats each week. Size was determined by comparing the palpated masses with wooden spheres of defined diameters. When there was a discrepancy between the previous week in number or size of the masses, then both individuals palpated the animal and resolved the discrepancy. At the time of necropsy, the clinical observations were available to the pathologist; additional masses were found at necropsy. The skin and mammary glands were removed and placed on a light box to visualize the tumors. Masses were measured in two directions and collected in formalin. The mammary glands, lung, liver, kidney and all masses were fixed in formalin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined histologically in study 1. In study 2, the mammary glands and all masses were examined histologically. Each gross lesion was uniquely identified and followed through processing; histological diagnoses were correlated with each gross lesion identified in the mammary gland. The measurements at necropsy were used to calculate the area of the mammary gland carcinomas for each group.",

Some studies also reported no difference in the incidence of tumors with magnetic field exposure (10), but one of the studies involved small numbers of animals at low field intensities (13). The positive effects reported were often an earlier onset of tumors (11,16,23) or an increase in tumor size (10,11,14). However, in some studies there was no increase in tumor size (16,23). We found no indication for earlier onset of tumors, but in the second 13 week study there was a small but insignificant increase in tumor size (controls, 1.9 cm2; 1 G, 50 Hz, 2.0 cm2; 5 G, 50 Hz, 2.2 cm2). However, when the data are expressed as carcinoma area/animal there is a small decrease (controls, 1.9 cm2; 1 G, 50 Hz, 1.8 cm2; 5 G, 50 Hz, 1.7 cm2). Further, there was no tendency for an increase in tumor size in the first 13 week study (2.2, 2.4, 2.0 and 2.1 cm2 for the control, 5 G, 50 Hz, 5 G, 50 Hz and 1 G, 60 Hz groups, respectively). Thus, our interpretation is that these studies do not provide evidence that magnetic field exposure increases tumor size. Finally, the palpation data do not suggest that there is an earlier onset of tumors.",

We and previous studies used Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, but the sources of the strain of rats were quite different (Exertal, Germany and Raleigh, NC), rodent feed varied and our study also had a shorter daily exposure duration (18.5 h/day, 7 days/week), whereas exposures in the Hannover studies were for 24 h/day. The reported promotional effects of magnetic fields on breast cancer in the rat are subtle and not always consistent (10\u201315). Further, a seasonal influence on DMBA-induced breast cancer in their model (24) has been reported. Thus, it may not be easy to replicate subtle changes that have some seasonal variation.",
