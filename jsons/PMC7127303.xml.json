The most-cited national survey was undertaken in twelve regions of China in 1982 (n=38,136) (Twelve Region Psychiatric Epidemiological Study Work Group, 1986), and repeated with almost identical case ascertainment strategies in seven regions in 1993 (n=19,223). In the 1982 survey, the point and lifetime prevalence of affective disorder was 0.037% and 0.076% (Zhao et al., 1986); in the 1993 survey, the point and lifetime prevalence of affective disorder was 0.052% and 0.083%, and no evidence of an increase was found in the prevalence of affective disorders (Wang et al., 1998).",

These were well-designed, population-based surveys that used structured psychiatric interviews. They have indeed found higher rates of depression in China, though the comparability to older studies is limited. For example, Shen et al. (2006) reported a psychiatric epidemiological survey in Beijing and Shanghai (the two largest metropolitan cities in China). They interviewed 5201 subjects (2633 in Beijing and 2568 in Shanghai respectively) using a multistage household probability sampling method, and all subjects were also assessed with a Chinese version of the World Health Organization World Mental Health WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO MH-CIDI). They found that the 12-month prevalence of any DSM-IV mental disorder in metropolitan China was 7.0%, with major depressive disorder (2.0%) being the most common. These studies suggest that, although it is not as common as that in Western populations, depression in the Chinese population is still a relatively common mental disorder which deserves more attention.",

They reported the adjusted one-month prevalence of a major depressive episode (MDE) was 1.55% and 2.60% for men and women, respectively. Another study, conducted in Beijing in 2003 involved a much larger sample (N=5926 adults) and also used the WHO MH-CIDI (version 1.0). They reported the time-point prevalence rate of depressive disorder was 3.31% while the life-time prevalence rate was 6.87%. Unfortunately, the study was interrupted and forced to end prematurely due to the unexpected outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing in 2003. 15.69% of the target respondents did not complete the interview (Ma et al., 2007). The impact of the outbreak on the results is unknown, and given the large number of incomplete interviews, the data may not generalize to the greater Beijing population.",

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Beijing has increased from 34,892 RMBs per capita in 2003 (Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, 2003) to 75,943 RMBs per capita (The dollar-RMB exchange rate is 6.12) in 2010 (Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics and NBS Survey Office in Beijing, 2010). The process of urbanization has gone faster and 86.2% of Beijing\u05f3s current population are urban dwellers (Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, 2014). Given that socioeconomic development and mental health status of the population are inter-related, some even speculate that modern environments may cause an epidemic of mental illness (Lee et al., 2007, Hidaka, 2012). To address the mental health issues related to this new socioeconomic reality, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of China (now part of the newly established National Health and Family Planning Commission), the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security and the China Disabled Persons Federation have worked closely to formulate China\u05f3s mental health work plan (2002\u20132010). This has started to have a positive impact in the field of mental health care in China and more targeted efforts are expected, pending the data regarding prevalence, public attitude and mental health resources obtained from well-designed studies.",

This study was part of a large-scale cross-sectional epidemiologic study on mental disorders, and the calculation of sample size was based on the relative low prevalence of schizophrenia. According to the survey data of mental disorders in 1991 in Beijing, the lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia was 0.721% (Guo et al., 1994). The sample size of this survey was determined to be 16,562 using the sample size formula (\u03b1=0.01, U=1.645, \u03b4=0.15P). Taking into account the possibility that some would refuse or be unable to participate, we increased the sample size by 20%, resulting in a total of 19,874 residents to be identified. The household was the basic sampling unit in this survey. The average number of residents in each urban household was 2.4, and in each rural household was 2.6. Therefore, 9185 households were to be selected in order to reach 19,874 potential respondents.",

However, few large-scale epidemiological studies have utilized the SCID as a diagnostic tool on a global scale.

In fact, so far only large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in China (Phillips et al., 2009) have used the SCID as an assessment tool. Two major differences between those by Phillips et al. (2009) and the current one are worth pointing out: First, the studies by Phillips et al. (2009) involved a two-stage screening process. In the first stage all subjects were screened with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and classified into three risk strata for mental disorder, and in the second-stage all high-risk respondents and a random selection of moderate or low risk respondents were assigned to complete the diagnostic assessment using the SCID. Second, only less than one third (28%) of the study subjects completed the assessment with the SCID. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first large-scale representative community epidemiological survey in which all respondents were screened using a one-stage investigation method with the SCID performed by mental health professionals. These are the most notable strengths of this study.",

On the other hand, our rates are lower than the survey conducted in the Zhejiang province, a relatively developed province in east China (4.3% point prevalence) (Shi et al., 2005). The results of the current study are lower than those reported by Ma et al. (2007), in which they estimated the point and life-time prevalence of ICD-10 depressive disorder to be 3.31% and 6.87%, respectively (Ma et al., 2007). As mentioned in the introduction, the study by Ma et al. (2007) used a different assessment tool (WHO MH-CIDI) and diagnostic criteria. In addition, the 2003 study was different from the current one in the following ways: (1) the 2003 study included MDD and other depressive disorders, such as dysthymia disorder and the depressive episodes of bipolar disorder, while the current study focused on MDD only; (2) the 2003 study focused specifically on depressive disorders, while this study was a part of a comprehensive study that focused on all types of mental disorders; (3) the sampling design of the survey in 2003 was to select the respondents whose date of birth was the closet to the investigation time in every selected household (Ma et al., 2007), while the sampling unit of the current study was the household unit with assessments performed on all of the family members who met the criteria in each selected household.",

However, a number of speculations about the low rates of depression in Chinese have been proposed. (1) Biological factors: several previous studies indicated that the prevalence of depression among the Chinese living on mainland China is not only lower as compared to western populations, but the prevalence of depression among Chinese people living in America is also significantly lower than other ethnic groups (Gonzalez et al., 2010); (2) Cultural factors: some believe that the traditional Chinese social and cultural factors and values may play protective roles. For example, Tan (2014) reported the life-time prevalence of MDD in immigrant Chinese women was 8.5% vs 33.1% in US-born Chinese American women, suggesting the collectivist culture might play a protective role. (3) The instrument used in this study was translated from the English language, and some descriptions of emotions may be difficult to understand. It has been suggested in a previous study that the SCID could be less sensitive to the means of expressing emotion in the Chinese population. As a result, the prevalence of depression NOS is relative higher and the prevalence of MDD is relative low (Shi et al., 2005). (4) The stigmatization of the mentally ill in Chinese society is relatively prevalent. Some tend to somatize psychological problems, and those with a mental disorder may be reluctant to endorse symptoms. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that some people with lifetime MDD fail to report their history of depression in cross-sectional studies (Patten et al., 2011). This can lead to an underestimation of MDD in a population-based epidemiological study (Kessler et al., 2010b).",

Although there were no statistical significances in sex, age, and location of residence between respondents and individuals who failed to participate, it is unclear how this missing segment of the population may have impacted the results. It is possible that those people with depression might have been more reluctant to participate than non-depressed residents, leading to an under-estimation of the actual prevalence.",
