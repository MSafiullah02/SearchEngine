The two bovine noroviruses, Bo/Newbury2/76/UK and Bo/Jena/80/DE, represent two distinct genetic clusters in the newly described genogroup III. In the present study, Jena-like polymerase sequences were identified for the first time in the UK, but one of these, Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK, was a chimeric virus. Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK had a Jena-like polymerase gene but Newbury2-like capsid and ORF3 genes by comparison of their genome organization, nucleotide, and amino acid identities and phylogenetic analyses. The present study is one of few studies to clearly demonstrate the existence of chimeric genomes in the Norovirus genus and the first, to our knowledge, to identify a chimeric genome in genogroup III. It provides additional support that genomic recombination is part of the natural evolution of noroviruses and is relevant to the diagnosis and immunological control of norovirus diarrhea outbreaks.

The noroviruses have positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes that range from 7.2 to 7.7 kb, which are organized into three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for the nonstructural proteins (ORF1), a capsid protein (ORF2) and the ORF3 protein (Jiang et al., 1993; Lambden et al., 1993) . Genomic analyses of the bovine enteric caliciviruses (BoCVs) showed that they formed a third norovirus genogroup distinct from genogroups I and II to which the human noroviruses belong (Ando et al., 2000; Dastjerdi et al., 1999; Liu et al., 1999; Oliver et al., 2003) . In contrast to the human genogroup I and II noroviruses (reviewed by Green et al., 2001) , the extent of genomic and antigenic diversity among the BoCVs is not well characterized. The two human norovirus genogroups each contain at least seven genetic clusters (Ando et al., 2000; Green et al., 2001) . Ando et al. (2000) proposed two genetic clusters of BoCVs based on limited analysis of short regions of the capsid genes from two BoCVs. This suggestion was confirmed by Oliver et al. (2003) by phylogenetic analyses of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), capsid, and ORF3 genes of three additional viruses from the UK. The two clusters were represented by viruses similar to Bo/Newbury2/76/UK, identified in the UK in 1976, and a single virus from Germany, Bo/Jena/80/ DE, identified in 1980. In addition to phylogenetic analyses, Oliver et al. (2003) identified differences between the two genogroup III clusters. The complete capsid (ORF2) proteins of four Newbury2-like viruses were predicted to be 522 amino acids long, 3 amino acids longer than the capsid protein of Bo/Jena/80/DE. The third ORF of the Newbury2like viruses was predicted to be 282 amino acids long, 59 amino acids longer than Bo/Jena/80/DE, from an initiation codon 209 nucleotides upstream of the ORF2 termination codon. Other differences, such as insertions and deletions in the capsid and ORF3 genes and differences in the lengths of the 3V nontranslated regions, were also observed between the two genetic clusters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 229, "text": "(Anon, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 230, "end": 251, "text": "Bridger et al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 252, "end": 275, "text": "Dastjerdi et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 276, "end": 300, "text": "Fankhauser et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 301, "end": 318, "text": "Liu et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 319, "end": 337, "text": "Mead et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 338, "end": 358, "text": "Oliver et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 359, "end": 381, "text": "Reynolds et al., 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 382, "end": 402, "text": "Smiley et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 403, "end": 429, "text": "van der Poel et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 430, "end": 454, "text": "Woode and Bridger, 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 707, "end": 727, "text": "(Jiang et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 728, "end": 749, "text": "Lambden et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 937, "end": 956, "text": "(Ando et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 957, "end": 980, "text": "Dastjerdi et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 981, "end": 998, "text": "Liu et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1019, "text": "Oliver et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1110, "text": "Green et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1301, "text": "(Ando et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1321, "text": "Green et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1342, "text": "Ando et al.

Katayama et al. (2002) confirmed genomic recombination between genogroup II noroviruses and also provided the first evidence for chimeric genomes in norovirus genogroup I. In both these studies with the three human noroviruses, the point of recombination was at the ORF1-2 overlap, the same region identified for the bovine genogroup III Bo/Thirsk10/ 00/UK virus. Additional studies support the existence of human noroviruses with chimeric genomes (Hardy et al., 1997; Lochridge and Hardy, 2003; Vinje et al., 2000) . However, in contrast to Jiang et al. (1999a) , Katayama et al. (2002) , and the present study, a contiguous cDNA of the polymerase and complete capsid genes was not used, but regions from the RdRp, capsid, and ORF3 genes were amplified independently. These could be generated from the genes of different viruses, rather than from a single virus, if a mixed population of viruses was present in the original fecal sample. Mixed populations have been described with human diarrhea samples (Gray et al., 1997) . This led to conclude that their data did not strictly show that noroviruses with chimeric genomes were identified. Hardy et al. (1997) predicted that further chimeric viruses would be identified and this has proved to be true.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 268, "text": "(Jiang et al., 1999a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 269, "end": 291, "text": "Katayama et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 473, "end": 494, "text": "(Jiang et al., 1999a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 955, "end": 977, "text": "Katayama et al.

This observation was endorsed by recent surveillance data from the CDC, which showed that only 41% of human norovirus outbreaks typed using the capsid gene were associated with the same genetic cluster when the RdRp gene was used for typing (Anon, 2003) . If chimeric BoCVs are not rare, diagnostic methods need to be used that take this into account. Vaccination is used to control calf diarrhea caused by bovine rotaviruses and coronaviruses (Crouch et al., 2001) . It is possible that a calicivirus component might be incorporated into these vaccines.
