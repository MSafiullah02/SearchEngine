The number of samples submitted for analysis each day exceeded testing capacity, resulting in a backlog of specimens that was only cleared after high-throughput testing platforms were put into production. Figure 1A) , while data based on date of result best fit an exponential (y = 3.0699e 0.2355x , R\u00b2 = 0.99, Figure 1B ). On day 31 (04/12/2020), the actual case number was 696, which was in alignment with the quadratic model (630 cases, Figure 1 ) but not the exponential based on date of results (4,547 cases, Figure 1B ). It is not unusual that data used to generate prediction models are based on date of results, as was the case in New Mexico and other states (3, 4) . As a result, models based on date of result rather than date of collection may lead to overestimates of future case numbers. Our quadratic model ( Figure 1A ) has maintained R 2 >0.99 on each day additional data are added, reinforcing the strength of the model and its projections.",
