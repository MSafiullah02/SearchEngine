            "text": "The implementation of effective prevention strategies has significantly reduced the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation (allo-HSCT)1; nevertheless, this clinical entity persists as a major clinical problem owing to poor survival, despite timely initiation of targeted antiviral therapy.1, 2 Currently, diagnosis of CMV pneumonia still remains a challenge. Proven CMV pneumonia can only be diagnosed using virological, histopathological or immunochemistry methods on biopsied lung tissue1; this specimen type, however, is rarely obtained due to potential life-threatening complications. Traditionally, culture-based bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) testing has been the mainstay for suggesting CMV involvement ex vivo,3 although detection of viable CMV in BAL fluids only points to a probable causality.4 Moreover, conventional virological procedures have been largely abandoned in most laboratories. Qualitative detection of CMV DNA in lung specimens by nucleic acid testing assays does not allow diagnosis of CMV pneumonia, since it may be present in the absence of probable or proven disease (pulmonary CMV shedding).5, 6, 7 Recent studies suggested that quantitation of CMV DNA in BAL fluids may permit discrimination between these two conditions9\n\u2013\n11; specifically, a cut-off CMV DNA level >500 IU/ml was proposed to serve that purpose, this displaying a positive predictive value of roughly 50% for probable CMV pneumonia using current prevalence rates.10 Nevertheless, validation of diagnostic viral load threshold across centers using different real-time PCR assays for CMV DNA quantitation and procedures for BAL obtention seems of paramount relevance. This task is hampered by the very low incidence of CMV pneumonia nowadays (<2%)3, 12 and the difficulty in establishing an incontrovertible diagnosis, even when lung tissue specimens are available for testing.13, 14, 15\n\u2013\n16 Exploratory studies gathering information on the range of CMV DNA loads measured in BAL specimens from allo-HSCT patients with pneumonia in whom CMV causality is unlikely or can be reasonably ruled out may provide useful information and are thus warranted. Here, we report on our experience on this matter.",

Unrelated allo-HSCT recipients were treated with oral valganciclovir (900 mg/day) through day 180 after transplantation. At this center, plasma CMV DNA load was quantified using the CMV R-GENE\u00ae (Biomerieux, L'Etoile, Paris, France),23 which displays a limit of detection of 150 IU/ml, prior DNA extraction using the Virus/Pathogens Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) on the QIAsymphony DSP platform (Qiagen). Plasma CMV DNA monitoring was performed once a week within the first 100 days, fortnightly from day 100 to day 180, and every 2\u20134 weeks thereafter through day 365 after transplantation. Detection of any level of CMV DNA in plasma prompted the administration of antiviral therapy with (val)ganciclovir or foscarnet at the doses specified above. Anti-CMV therapy was given at the physician discretion when patients with CMV DNA detected in BAL specimens had concurrent CMV DNAemia with CMV DNA levels below the threshold for preemptive antiviral therapy.",

Moreover, no cut-off value for CMV DNA load in BAL fluid specimens discriminating between CMV pneumonia and pulmonary CMV DNA shedding in allo-HSCT recipients has been established at the present time.4 The assessment of the performance of quantitative CMV DNA PCR testing for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia faces several difficulties including: (i) the low incidence of this clinical event, (ii) the lack of a normalized procedure for CMV DNA PCR testing on BAL fluids, (iii) the non-negligible possibility of miscategorization of pneumonia cases as either being causally linked or unrelated to CMV when using BAL fluid specimens, or even lung tissue material, for CMV diagnosis,8 (iv) the persistence of a large variability of CMV DNA loads provided by different real-time PCR assays,31, 32\n\u2013\n33 despite their calibration to the WHO International Standard for CMV DNA24 and, as already mentioned, (v) the relegation of virological procedures for CMV detection in clinical specimens. Inevitably, all these drawbacks were encountered in this study, so that we aimed not to establish a diagnostic cut-off, but rather to assess the range of CMV DNA loads quantifiable in BAL fluid specimens from patients in whom the causal involvement of CMV was highly unlikely or could be reasonably discarded; this, having in mind that we surely incurred CMV pneumonia infradiagnosis. Nevertheless, we perceived this limitation as not being an insoslayable obstacle to our purpose as: (i) CMV is unlikely to be the etiological agent of more than 10% of pneumonia cases among allo-HSCT recipients who undergo routine bronchoscopy,10 and (ii) survival of patients with CMV pneumonia who do not undergo specific anti-CMV treatment with appropriate doses of (val)ganciclovir or foscarnet is highly unlikely, provided the high rate of CMV pneumonia-associated mortality.4 We retrospectively reviewed clinical and microbiological data from patients who underwent routine quantitative CMV PCR testing on BAL fluid specimens at two transplant centers in our city. We deliberately chose not to include archived BAL specimens in our series because of the lack of data on the impact of cryopreservation on CMV DNA load quantitation in this sample type.",

Interestingly, median CMV DNA loads were comparable irrespective of the nature and the number of co-detected microorganisms (at both participating centers), and were overall higher in the presence of concurrent DNAemia. As for the latter observation, in agreement with Boeckh et al.,10 we found this not to be due to pulmonary hemorrhage (not shown). Overall, CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens processed at HLF were of greater magnitude than those analyzed at HCU. Since CMV DNA loads produced by the Argene PCR assay are slightly lower than those measured by the Abbott PCR assay (not shown), differences in the net state of immunosuppression of patients at the time of BAL sampling across centers, as reflected by the immunodeficiency score index (higher for HLF patients), may account for this observation.

Tan et al.,8 in contrast, found CMV DNA levels in BAL fluid samples to have a limited value to distinguish between CMV and non-CMV pneumonia cases. It is pertinent to mention here that the above threshold is between one and two log10 lower than those tentatively proposed for diagnosing CMV pneumonia in lung transplant recipients.34, 35, 36, 37\n\u2013\n38 Interestingly, control patients with non-CMV pneumonia in the Boeckh study10 showed a median CMV DNA load of 0 log10 IU/ml (IQR, 0\u20131.6 IU/mL), with CMV DNA levels between 100 and 500 IU/ml in roughly 64% of cases and >500 IU/ml in 36% of them. Here, the opposite was true, with nearly 60% of BAL fluid samples from patients with non-proven CMV pneumonia having CMV viral loads >500 IU/ml, of which 75% had >1000 IU/ml. It is worth highlighting that these figures were comparable at both participating centers, despite the above-referred differences in CMV DNA loads provided by PCR assays used at each center. To gauge the potential relevance of these data, it must be taken into consideration that in nearly 70% of pneumonia episodes in our cohort, BAL sampling was performed while patients were under anti-CMV therapy (>3 days), whereas in the aforementioned study,10 only 24% of patients with CMV pneumonia and 35% of patients with non-CMV pneumonia had been treated with antivirals for at least two days. Despite this fact, higher CMV DNA loads in BAL fluid specimens were quantified in the current study, likely reflecting major differences regarding the DNAemia cut-off triggering the inception of antiviral therapy between these studies (much higher in the current cohort). In fact, in this series, the median CMV DNA load in BAL was significantly higher in patients who were under antiviral therapy than in non-treated patients.",

The relative scarce number of pneumonia cases in which BAL specimens had CMV DNA loads >500 IU/ml did not allow to investigate whether this apparent effect exhibited a dose-response pattern. Again, this finding must be interpreted cautiously, as in order to avoid overfitting, Cox models were not adjusted to a number of factors that may have had an impact on mortality (i.e., adequacy of antimicrobial treatment, severity of pneumonia, among others). The limited size of the current cohort also precluded any meaningful statistical analysis evaluating the impact of CMV DNA load in BAL at each center, separately. Further studies are urgently needed to validate this observation, since this subset of patients may benefit from short courses of anti-CMV therapy.10\n",

Nevertheless, this study has several strengths, including the inclusion of consecutive specimens, the use of fresh BAL fluid specimens and highly-sensitive real-time PCR assays for CMV DNA load quantitation, and the performance of a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of specimens for the presence of RVs pathogens using molecular assays.",
