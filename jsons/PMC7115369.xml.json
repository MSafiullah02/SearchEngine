It is estimated that approximately 15% of HCV-infected individuals eliminate the virus spontaneously, whereas 25% develop a mild form of the disease and 60% progress to the chronic form. Fibrosis is the principal complication of chronic hepatitis C, which increases both morbidity and mortality because of complications such as cirrhosis or hepatocarcinoma.",

Three MASPs have been described: MASP-1, -2, and -3. MASP-2 plays the predominant functional role in the activation of the lectin pathway [6], whereas MASP-2 forms complexes with the pattern recognition molecules MBL and ficolins (H-ficolin, L-ficolin, or M-ficolin) and is activated when one of these proteins recognizes micro-organisms leading to the subsequent cleavage of C4 and C2, thus initiating complement cascade activation [7], [8]. HCV encodes two highly glycosylated envelope proteins, E1 and E2, which are potential targets for interaction with MBL and ficolins [9].",

The MASP-2 protein is composed of six modules and a linker region: an N-terminal CUB domain (CUB1) followed by epidermal growth factor (EGF)\u2013like domain of Ca2+ binding type, a second CUB domain (CUB-2), 2 contiguous complement control protein modules (CCP1 and CCP2), a short linker, and finally, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease (SP) domain. The interaction with MBL and L-ficolin is determined by N-terminal CUB1-EGF moiety but is strengthened by the presence of the CUB2 module [11]. Two complement control protein (CCP) molecules and the SP domain perform the catalytic activity of the entire molecule and CCP2 retains the essential role in C4 cleavage [12].",

Although the complement cascade activation in the presence of the p.D371Y variant (c.1111 G > T) was not analyzed in the present study, we speculate that in individuals homozygous for this polymorphism, MASP-2 may be less functional. It is possible that the amino acid change in this position causes modification in the catalytic region of the enzyme, altering the substrate specificity. Although the conversion of aspartic acid to tyrosine in p.D371Y (c.1111 G > T) can be accommodated in the molecule without disturbing its overall structure, it is possible that this variation has a functional effect in response to HCV infection.
