The 1999 investigation focused on exploring the possible causal link between KD and Chlamydia pneumoniae and the details of the investigation and case-control design are described by Schrag et al. [4]. After the 1999 investigation was completed, the pharyngeal swab samples were stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Pharyngeal swab samples were available for analysis from 10 patients with KD and from 6 control subjects. The patients, who had onset of KD between 9 February and 20 March 1999, had a median age of 3.6 years (range, 0.6\u20138.6 years). The patients met the epidemiologic case definition for KD: they had fever lasting for \u2a7e5 days and had at least 4 of the 5 clinical features of KD [4]. The median age for the control subjects was 3.3 years (range, 1.3\u20138.3 years). Pharyngeal swab samples were obtained within 10 days of the onset of illness in 6 of the patients with KD and on days 11, 15, 16, and 37 after the onset of illness in the remaining 4 patients",

Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 \u03bcL of the pharyngeal swab samples by use of the automated NucliSens Extractor (bioM\u00e9rieux). Twenty-five-microliter reactions containing 5 \u03bcL of the extracted nucleic acid were prepared with the 1-step Access RT-PCR System (Promega). The first primer set used for amplification was an HCoV-NH/HCoV-NL63\u2013specific primer described by Esper et al. [1] that had the following modification: a single nucleotide degeneracy was introduced into the sense-strand primer, 5\u2032-GCGCTATGAGGGTGGTTGYAAC-3\u2032, to accommodate a sequence variation among published sequences of HCoV-NH/HCoV-NL63 strains (the underlining indicates the modification). The amplification program consisted of a reverse-transcription (RT) step of 45 min at 45\u00b0C and 2 min at 94\u00b0C, to denature the reverse transcriptase; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C; and 10 min at 72\u00b0C, for final amplicon extension. The second RT\u2013polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set had broadly reactive primers designed to target highly conserved regions of the HCoV RNA polymerase gene: sense-strand primer 5\u2032-GGTTGGGATTATCCTAARTGTGA-3\u2032 and antisense strand primer 5\u2032-TATAACACACAACACCYTCATCA-3\u2032. Amplification reactions were performed as described above, and the following program settings were used: an RT step of 45 min at 45\u00b0C and 2 min at 94\u00b0C, to denature the reverse transcriptase; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 54\u00b0C, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C; and 5 min at 72\u00b0C, for final amplicon extension",

Assays were performed using standard viral nucleic acid extracts (HCoV 229E and OC43) and nuclease-free water for positive and negative controls, respectively.
