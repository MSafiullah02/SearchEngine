Sometimes these samples have bronchial mucosa and cartilage if a branch point, such as a minor carina, is sampled directly (Fig. 3\n). Many types of pulmonary infections can be diagnosed using fine needle aspiration and cytologic evaluation.28, 29, 30, 31 Fine needle aspiration is an especially useful technique, because respiratory secretions (eg, sputum, bronchial washings, brushings, bronchoalveolar lavage) are often limited by the need to differentiate true pathogens from contaminant organisms. Nevertheless, these diagnostic tools are complementary and both remain excellent options in the diagnosis of localized or diffuse pulmonary infection. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy has proven effective in assessing pulmonary nodules accurately with low complication rates. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy uses computer guidance to enable bronchoscopic access to pulmonary lesions (Fig. 4\n).32, 33\n",

Besides the morphologic features of the microorganism, important cytologic clues to the diagnosis include the accompanying cellular response and the presence and character of any necrotic debris. Anaerobic pulmonary infections, typically in the form of a lung abscess, can also be approached in this way or with transthoracic needle aspiration (Fig. 8\n).48\n",

Video-assisted thoracic surgery has become the standard approach for most surgical biopsies. Mortality is low and length of hospital stay and recovery are improved over those with the standard thoracotomy.52 When the same thoracic access ports are used, ipsilateral lymph nodes that may contain disease or abnormalities can be biopsied simultaneously. Before a wedge lung biopsy is performed, consultation among the radiologist, chest physician, and thoracic surgeon is essential to identify ideal locations for biopsy.",

In the 2005 guidelines from the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) for HAP and VAP, an additional category, HCAP, was proposed to the existing paradigm.23 These patients share risk factors for DRP with those susceptible to HAP and VAP, including exposure to P aeruginosa, extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and MRSA. Included in the new classification are patients hospitalized within the past 90 days; those receiving chemotherapy, wound care, or intravenous antibiotics; residents of nursing homes or long-term facilities; and patients undergoing hemodialysis. For these patients, the guidelines recommend a more aggressive empiric antibiotic regimen, including an antipseudomonal \u03b2-lactam plus either an aminoglycoside or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone, plus an agent active against MRSA if risk factors for MRSA are present (Table 4\n).",
