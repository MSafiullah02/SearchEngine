The authors noted that the first cases of flu in Philadelphia were reported on September 17, 1918; however, they were downplayed, and officials allowed large public gatherings, notably a parade in support of the war effort on September 28th. In fact, Philadelphia did not implement social distancing measures until October 3rd, which was when disease spread was already overwhelming medical and health resources. St. Louis authorities, by contrast, implemented measures designed to promote social distancing within 2 days of the first civilian flu cases in the city on October 5, 1918 (Hatchett et al., 2007) .",

Jurisdictions asked for retired health care professionals and individuals currently enrolled in public health, nursing, or medical school to complete a survey to determine volunteer eligibility. In other cases, non-nursing staff, upon completion of required training, were authorized to perform tasks otherwise limited to the scope of practice of a licensed or registered nurse-though these individuals were to remain under the supervision of a nurse. Others issued a temporary registration to an applicant as a certified nurse aide, regardless of whether the applicant demonstrated that he or she had successfully completed the examination requirements. The temporary registration would be valid for 28 days and could be renewed by the relevant state authority until the termination of the state of emergency. In some U.S. territories, hiring, overtime, and procurement were authorized by executive order, as was the suspension of any regulations that prevent, hinder, or delay the response to a public health emergency. Some boards of nursing in non-NLC states updated their policies to expedite the processing of reciprocal license applications for nurses that were licensed in another jurisdiction. These updated policies would allow those applications to be processed as efficiently as possible-in at least one jurisdiction, within 1 business day. Other states, such as California, Massahusetts, and Michigan, reserved the ability to renew a license regardless of the number of continued education hours completed or to recognize hours worked in response to COVID-19 as hours toward continued education (e.g., Newsom, 2020; Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 2020; Whitmer, 2020) .",

Public health proclamations or other forms of emergency state legislation suspended state restrictions that practitioners cannot practice with an inactive or lapsed license, though this provision was usually extended only to practitioners whose licenses had lapsed within a certain time frame, such as the past 5 years. These exceptions were also usually limited to the treatment of those affected by the public health disaster and lasted solely throughout the duration of the proclamation or state of emergency. In addition to interstate reciprocity and authorizing inactive practitioners, some NLC jurisdictions expanded the scope of practice for health care practitioners and issued temporary permits for LPNs, RNs, and advanced practice RNs who had active, unencumbered licenses in any other U.S. jurisdiction and who were entering into the state in question to respond to the declared emergency.",
