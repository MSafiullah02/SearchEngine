            "text": "The issue of data protection in research is becoming of pivotal importance, in particular in the last months with the pandemic emergency of COVID-19. Studying the development of the outbreak on affected populations under a scientific and statistic perspective is necessary to understand the trend of contagion, the effectiveness of social distancing measures, the most vulnerable people who are the target of the virus, etc. This has posed several questions in terms of privacy and data protection. 2 Medical researchers and even data scientists might use health data of patients for secondary purposes, different from the original purpose of the mere provision of healthcare services. In addition, researchers might analyse telcom data, such as location data, 3 of patients (or just of citizens of mostly affected area) to understand their movements and the spread of the virus. 4 Also, beyond research, these data have high potentials for further purposes (state surveillance on infected people, the enforcement of social distancing rules, etc.), and related high risks for fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects (discrimination, stigmatization, unnecessary state surveillance and related chilling effect, profiling for manipulative purposes, etc.). 5 Accordingly, the application of privacy and data protection rules to research has reached higher attention in media and in the academic arena, although the topic seemed to be not adequately discussed in literature so far, unless few but relevant exceptions in the last few months. 6 This is why the need to further analyse this topic is even more pressing today.

The notion of research is now explicitly mentioned as an exception to the prohibition of processing of special categories of personal data (Article 9(j)), but also as an exception to the purpose limitation principle (Article 5(1)(b), to the storage limitation principle (Article 5(1)(e) and as a possible derogation from some rights (right to access, rectification, restriction and objection). These exceptions, however, are counterbalanced by a specific article about safeguards to be adopted in case of research purposes (Article 89). As also the preamble reveals, the GDPR recognises and encourages the development of scientific research 7 (and this is why it provides specific exemptions to the general limits of data protection principles and rights), but with alternative suitable measures that need to be respected. Such measures may include specific transparency safeguards, simplified exercise of data protection rights, security measures and an attentive analysis of the impact of research on data subjects. In other words, one of the most relevant principles that researchers should take into account is accountability (see Ben Wagner in this special issue). Notions like data protection by design and DPIA becomes thus central. In general terms, we can affirm that there is a sui generis protection for the processing of personal data for research purposes. 8",

The EDPB has already been very critical to the large use of consent in data processing for research purposes, in particular in case of medical trials. 14 Research subjects are often in a situation of power asymmetry (patients, employees, asylum seekers, etc.) that generates decisional vulnerability. 15 Such vulnerability does not allow them to give a really free consent according to Article 7 GDPR. This is in line with large part of legal literature in the field of data protection that recommends limiting the use of -consent\u2016 as a legal basis due to its fallacy and the difficulty to reach a really informed and free consent. 16 However, the EDPS seems to generally accept the use of consent in the research field, although at some specific conditions. 17 The problem of using alternative legal bases are at least two.",

As we affirmed above, the risks (e.g. for data of people tested positive to COVID-19) of secondary purposes with significantly adverse effects on individuals (and on democracy in general) might be relevant. The principle of purpose limitation in research might be limited, but relevant safeguards (Article 89) should be implemented: e.g., pseudonymization, transparency and personalized safeguards for vulnerable individuals (see Denise Amram in this special issue).
