            "text": "The neonatal diarrhoea complex is one of the main causes of calf morbidity and mortality causing major economic losses in many dairy and beef herds. Diarrhoea in calves is considered a multifactorial disease. Several environmental, managemental, nutritional and physiological factors may occur either alone or in synergy with the different infectious agents such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium sp., bovine group A rotavirus, calicivirus, torovirus and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (Snodgrass et al., 1986, Duckmanton et al., 1998, Naciri et al., 1999, Van Der Poel et al., 2000). This emphasizes the difficulties in investigating and diagnosing the infectious aetiology of calf diarrhoea. Diarrhoea caused by BCoV is clinically important and the virus also infects the respiratory tract of cattle and has been associated with winter dysentery in adult cattle (Clark, 1993, Saif, 1990).",

The genome of coronaviruses is the largest among the RNA viruses, 26\u201330 kb long, and encodes a nested set of multiple subgenomic mRNAs during infection (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The virion contains five major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the transmembrane protein (M), the hemaglutinin esterase protein (HE), the spike protein (S) and the small membrane protein (E). The N protein is a phosphoprotein of 50\u201360 kd that interacts with genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid and may play a role in replication of viral RNA (Lapps et al., 1987, Clark, 1993).",

            "text": "Electron microscopy (EM) may be used for the direct detection of BCoV in faecal samples (Collins et al., 1987, Bulgin et al., 1989). However, due to the common presence of pleomorphic membranous structures similar to the coronavirus it may be difficult to recognize BCoV by EM (Saif, 1990). Virus isolation in human rectal adenocarcinoma (HRT-18) cells is rarely used as a means of diagnosis because BCoV is difficult to isolate. Furthermore, virus isolation is a laborious method and requires a long time to obtain conclusive results (Dea et al., 1980, Tahir et al., 1995, Kapil et al., 1996). The haemagglutination (HA) test, performed directly with the faecal samples must be carefully interpreted since the faeces contain non-specific haemagglutinins providing false-positive results. The presence of colostral IgG1 and local IgA in faeces may also interfere with the HA results. The haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test is performed concurrently to improve the specificity of the HA test. Besides, another disadvantage of the HA/HI test is the need to maintain mouse colonies as sources of the fresh erythrocytes that are required for this diagnostic test (Sato et al., 1977, Kapil et al., 1999). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are probably the most widely used diagnostic test for BCoV although this test lacks sensitivity (Sato and Akashi, 1993, Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995, Schoenthaler and Kapil, 1999, Silva et al., 1999).",

Studies that describe the development of RT-PCR for BCoV detection from naturally infected diarrhoeic calves are still sporadic. Besides, there are no comparative studies on the ability of different primer sets to detect BCoV in clinical samples. Also, faeces remains the most difficult clinical sample for nucleic acid extraction and amplification due to the presence of PCR inhibitors that may yield false negative results (Monteiro et al., 1997). The use of an internal control in the PCR reaction has been most commonly applied to monitor and evaluate these failures, but this approach has not been used in assays for BCoV detection (Beld et al., 2004, Dingle et al., 2004, Hoorfar et al., 2004).",

Also of importance is the target region of BCoV RNA to be amplified. We chose the N gene because it is highly conserved among BCoV strains. It was concluded that the N protein is the most abundant antigen in coronavirus-infected cells because its RNA template is the smallest and it has the most abundant sgRNA (subgenomic RNA) during transcription (Hiscox et al., 2001). This indicates that there is more available RNA for the N gene than for the other BCoV protein genes.

We tested the primers designed by Tsunemtitsu et al. (1999) (RT-PCR) to compare the efficiency of the amplification in frozen and fresh samples from naturally infected calves. Although it was efficient for amplification of the positive control (Kakegawa strain), the same was not noted for clinical samples.

No absolute rules could be established to predict the ability of a primer pair to faithfully amplify a specific gene. However, the difference in detection rate may be the result of primer design.

            "text": "An adequate viral RNA extraction method is very important for molecular diagnosis. Four RNA extraction methods (TRIzol\u2122, phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, guanidinium isothiocyanate, and a combination of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and silica/guanidinium isothiocyanate) were tested and compared for BCoV detection in faecal samples. SN-PCR detection rates after RNA extraction using the combination of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and silica/guanidinium isothiocyanate methods were better than after other RNA extraction protocols (data not shown). The combination of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and silica/guanidinium isothiocyanate methods was performed according to Barreiros et al. (2004) with slight modifications. Faecal samples remain the most difficult specimens for nucleic acid extraction and amplification due the presence of inhibitors (Monteiro et al., 1997). Guanidinium isothiocyanate alone or in combination with phenol\u2013chloroform inactivates ribonucleases and therefore improves the stability of the extracted RNA genome (Romero, 1999). Van der Hoek et al. (1995), Hale et al. (1996), Rassol et al. (2002), Paula et al. (2003) also demonstrated that the guanidinium isothiocyanate method successfully removed inhibitors from faecal samples.",

However, the real frequency of the BCoV in neonatal calf diarrhoea outbreaks depends of the diagnostic technique. Cho et al. (2001) showed that nested PCR was 5000 times more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA. Therefore, the applicability of a sensitive technique such as PCR is fundamental to not underestimating the real prevalence of BCoV. Cho et al. (2001) also described a second round of amplification with the same primers described by Tsunemtitsu et al. (1999). However, this primer pair was tested only in fresh samples from experimentally infected calves and without an internal control.",

Differences in the ability to amplify and the characteristics of the PCR systems available for BCoV detection in clinical samples should be considered before use a test in future epidemiological studies. The rate of 24% positive diarrhoeic faecal samples confirms that the BCoV is an important etiological agent of neonatal diarrhoea in dairy and beef Brazilian cattle herds. The availability of a sensitive and specific diagnostic technique such as the SN-PCR described in this work will make it possible to undertake larger epidemiological studies of BCoV involved in the neonatal calf diarrhoea aetiology.",
