Five years ago and exactly 10 years after the SARS epidemic, the emergence of the novel influenza A (H7N9) virus caught the attention of the entire world. If, on the one hand, these epidemics raised questions on the fragmented and ineffective public health system in China, on the other hand, eyebrows were raised on Chinese Government's efforts to curb the flow of information.[1]",

In fact, realizing this with regard to disasters, the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction called upon national governments to continue to develop \u201cpeople-centered\u201d disaster risk and emergency management mechanisms.[2] The framework assumes significance in case of emergencies with cascading effects. Public health emergencies have an adverse cascading effect on not just our health systems but also the general public as well. Therefore, effective communication is the key.",

It becomes incumbent on the Government to keep the public informed about the emergency as well as the emergency response mounted to tackle it. Information on the emergency and its effect can be communicated through some simple means such as through the schools or community meetings or via the mass media such as radio, newspapers, and television. In wake of wide reach of social media, this can also be used for effective information dissemination.[3] However, the most important aspect of this information dissemination is that the information should be simple and clear.[3] This will not only help allay fears but will also convey important public health message regarding preventive, promotive, and curative aspect of public health emergency under question.",

Using this top-down approach in public health emergency may not work. The command and control approach to public health emergency has given way to a more flexible multi-stakeholders approach. This multi-stakeholders' approach places a greater faith on the members of the general public to effectively manage and exchange information. However, this \u201cshared responsibility\u201d does not mean that all members of the public are involved in the information flow, but it means to identify roles played by the members of the public in dissemination of information. These multiple stakeholders help effectively quell rumors, misinformation, and disinformation.[4] In addition, the presence of these multiple stakeholders helps public health researchers and policymakers with an independent pool of information for future use and reference. Critical collation of this information serves a long way in the effective management of public health emergencies. The article by Qiu W et al., will probably lead the way in identifying the communication problems for emergency management in infections disease epidemic.[5]",
