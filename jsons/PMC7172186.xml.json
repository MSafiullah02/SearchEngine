Diagnosis of hRSV infection in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) secretions is currently achieved by cell culture (CC) (Falsey et al., 2002, Johnston and Siegel, 1990, Malley et al., 1998), by the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay (Fong et al., 2000, Halstead et al., 1990, Landry and Ferguson, 2000, Rovida et al., 2005) or by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Falsey et al., 2003, Freymuth et al., 1995, Paton et al., 1992, Perkins et al., 2005). However, the sole presence of hRSV in NPA is not per se indicative of the etiologic involvement of the virus in the current episode of ARTI.",

In 63 hRSV-infected infants, hRSV RNA was quantified upon admission and, whenever possible, upon discharge, and at subsequent medical visits, as reported below. Overall, 49 infants had a single hRSV infection. In addition, 14 infants with multiple simultaneous (coinfections) or sequential (within 30 days) infections in the respiratory tract (including hRSV) were examined prospectively in order to identify the virus responsible for the current ARTI episode.",

Nucleic acids from NPAs were extracted using MINI MAG and NucliSens\u00ae Magnetic Extraction Reagents (BioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France). Degenerated primers AB1 and AB2 targeting the gene F, as reported elsewhere (Coiras et al., 2003) were used to amplify both hRSV subgroups A and B. Using the same primer set, a plasmid containing the PCR product of the reference hRSV Long strain (subgroup A) cloned in TA-Cloning (Invitrogen) was serially diluted in the range of 105 to 100 input copies to construct external reference standards. In addition, an internal RNA control was used, consisting of a predetermined amount of a synthetic heterologous RNA sequence (Armored RNA\u00ae, Ebola Virus, subtype Zaire, Ambion RNA Diagnostic, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Armored RNA\u00ae was extracted in parallel with clinical samples and plasmid serial dilutions, and a fixed amount of the extracted RNA (100 copies) was added to both RT-PCR reaction mixtures (samples and plasmids) containing, besides the primer pair hRSV AB1 (10 \u03bcM) and hRSV AB2 (10 \u03bcM), Ebola-specific primers ArmEBOFor (10 \u03bcM) and ArmEBORev (10 \u03bcM) (Sanchez et al., 1999). The thermal profile was: 10 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 2 min and 68 \u00b0C for 1 min + 3 s/cycle; then, 40 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, and 68 \u00b0C for 1 min + 3 s/cycle. Amplicons were visualized in 3% agarose gel, and quantified densitometrically. By using the Quantity One Programme software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), external standards normalized with the internal control allowed construction of a standard curve, from which the RNA copy number of test samples was derived. The sensitivity of the assay was 10 DNA copies/10 \u03bcl for both subgroups A and B. Quantitative hRSV results were expressed as RNA copy number/ml NPA following data multiplication by 100.",
