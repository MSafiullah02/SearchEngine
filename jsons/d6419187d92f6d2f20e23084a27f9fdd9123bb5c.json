At present, the prevalence of community transmission in Singapore remains low, and the risk of transmission in the local asymptomatic population without relevant travel history is correspondingly low.",

Endonasal AGPs theoretically present a higher risk of viral exposure than intubation due to the aggressive disruption of potentially virus-containing mucosa. The duration of exposure for these procedures is also longer than during intubation. Common high-risk AGPs in neurosurgery include endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery as well as anterior skull base procedures with the potential to breach the paranasal sinuses. Viral shedding has been found to be higher in the upper respiratory tract and, once aerosolized, virus particles remain airborne for more than 3 hours. 3,4 A high rate of infection has been reported among ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons performing upper airway procedures. 5 Endonasal surgery with the use of power tools should mandate the use of adequate protection due to potentially prolonged exposure to a high viral load. Neurosurgery and ENT departments across the nation have jointly developed advisories for these AGPs, in consultation with the Infec-tious Disease and Anesthesia Departments, and the hospitals' Surgical Division Committee.",

This was based on reports from Wuhan, China, that there was a high infection rate among ENT surgeons, and that the use of PAPRs anecdotally reduced the rate of transmission. A caveat was that the reports were not specific about whether the transmissions occurred during the actual surgery or during other perioperative phases (e.g., intubation, extubation, postop-EDITORIAL Endonasal neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: the Singapore perspective erative period). Our local consensus from Infectious Disease input is that for AGPs, even in COVID-19-positive patients, a properly fitted, molded, and handled N95 mask; eye protection (goggles/full face shield); and standard PPE (gown and gloves) should be adequate. 6, 7 Nevertheless, because there is uncertainty over the exact mechanisms of virus transmission, degree of aerosolization, amount of viral load exposure, and lack of data on appropriate PPE in endonasal AGPs, a more cautious stance was adopted in which the entire surgical and anesthetic team would don PAPRs during the surgery, with the exception of the circulating nurse and operating theater attendant. Intraoperatively, the use of power instruments is avoided as much as is feasible without compromising the surgical exposure-using rongeurs and chisels instead. We also avoid the use of nasal packing or pledgets, which will need to be removed in the postoperative phase, because removal may induce coughing or gagging.",

The safety of operating surgeons should be placed at the highest priority, although current resource limitation (or potential for such in the future) should also be taken into consideration to achieve a balance. Where possible, elective endonasal surgeries that are aerosol-generating should be deferred. For patients who do require urgent surgery, they should be assumed to be COVID-19-positive until proven otherwise, and managed accordingly. In accordance with this, the minimum PPE worn should be an N95 mask with goggles and standard PPE, but we recommend the use of PAPRs (where feasible and available) for the surgical team due to their closest proximity to the patient (Figs. 1 and   2 ). This is to mitigate the low but possible risk of operating on asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patients, which will increase as community prevalence increases, and in the absence of preoperative COVID-19 testing. For procedures in which headlight and loupes are required, alternative models of the PAPR such as the CleanSpace HALO may be used.",

One percent of blood specimens in a Chinese series contained detectable viral RNA. 8 These considerations have wider implications for the rest of neurosurgery Editorial and other surgical specialties. Given finite resources, extensive testing and/or use of PPE will not be practical. All elective procedures should be postponed to minimize this theoretical risk as much as possible. Power drills should be irrigated more meticulously to minimize aerosolization.",
