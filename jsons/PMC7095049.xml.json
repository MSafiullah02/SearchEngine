In 2003, the genome sequence of the Ames strain was published by a team led by the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville, Maryland2.",

The T5000 works by using a mass spectrometer to measure the total mass of a sample, along with a breakdown of the number of each of the four nucleotides in the sample. The type of microbe can be identified and the nucleotides compared to known isolates, thereby specifically linking one sample to another. It has been used for emerging pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza3. ",
