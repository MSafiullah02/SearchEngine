In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs for many important human viral pathogens, the identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that are able to neutralize viruses offers the possibility for effective pre-and/or post-exposure therapeutic modalities. Such hmAbs may also help in our understanding of the virus entry process, the mechanisms of virus neutralization, and in the eventual development of specific entry inhibitors, vaccines, and research tools. The majority of the more recently developed antiviral hmAbs have come from the use of antibody phage-display technologies using both na\u00efve and immune libraries. Many of these agents are also enveloped viruses possessing important neutralizing determinants within their membrane-anchored envelope glycoproteins, and the use of recombinant, soluble versions of these viral glycoproteins is often critical in the isolation and development of antiviral hmAbs. This chapter will detail several methods that have been successfully employed to produce, purify, and characterize soluble and secreted versions of several viral envelope glycoproteins which have been successfully used as antigens to capture and isolate human phage-displayed monoclonal antibodies.",

Rather, it has been the development of vaccines that has been the mainstay of prevention and intervention strategies for combating human and animal viral diseases. There are presently 15 viral vaccines approved for human use, excluding various subtypes, and the majority of these are live-attenuated formulations (reviewed in (1)). In general terms, these liveattenuated viral vaccines are highly effective because they elicit a balanced immune response in the recipient host, stimulating both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. However, for many viruses, especially those that have associated highly pathogenic characteristics as with Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4) restricted agents or retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the use of live-attenuated vaccines is not feasible.",

            "text": "A number of studies have demonstrated the importance of neutralizing antibodies in the protection or recovery from viral infections (2, 3) . Indeed, as obligate intracellular parasites, viruses pose significant challenges for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics. Neutralizing polyclonal antibodies have a long history of being effective against some viruses and more recently, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have also shown success. The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is currently the only mAb against a viral disease approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been widely used as a prophylactic measure against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in neonates and immune-compromised individuals and is more cost-effective and efficacious than the original polyclonal product (4) . Most recently, the anti-RSV palivizumab has been improved, and motavizumab has been shown to potently inhibit viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in a cotton rat model (5) . Virus-neutralizing antibodies can also be administered passively to acutely infected individuals and be highly efficacious. The mechanism of passively administered antibody therapy can be viewed as that of an antiviral drug: suppressing infection and permitting the host to mount an effective immune response (6) . Today, passively administered antibody is routinely used as an effective antiviral therapy or prophylactic for hepatitis B, varicella-zoster, rabies virus, measles virus, and others (reviewed in (2) ). In most cases their use is a first-line therapy as a post-exposure measure or in circumstances where vaccination is not possible. However, serum polyclonal antibody preparations have associated problems related to toxicity and potential allergic reactions, as well as lot-to-lot variation and uncertain dosing regimes (7) .",

            "text": "The major advances in furthering the development of specific mAbs has been through the use of bacterial phage-display platforms with combinatorial antibody libraries (8, 9) . Further, these phage libraries can be prepared to encode human antibodies as Fabs which contain the light-chain and the first two domains of the heavy-chain or single-chain variable domain fragments (scFvs) containing the variable domains of the light and heavy chains, and this technology has been complemented by innovative affinity maturation strategies to improve antibody binding (reviewed in (10) ). These techniques in human phage-display antibody platforms have facilitated the rapid identification and isolation of specific human mAbs, eliminating the immunization, hybridoma development, and humanization processes. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral drugs, the identification and characterization of new human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that are able to neutralize viruses offers the possibility for effective preand post-exposure therapeutic modalities. Such antibodies may also help in our understanding of the virus entry process and its underlying mechanisms, the viral neutralization mechanisms, and in the eventual development of specific entry inhibitors, vaccines, and research tools. There have been many recent examples of the development and isolation of hmAbs using phage-display methodologies reactive against important human viral pathogens including HIV-1 (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , the paramyxoviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) (17) , and the human SARS coronavirus (18) .",

All known viral envelope glycoproteins are homo-or heterooligomers in their mature and functional forms (20) and multimeric proteins, like these, generally interact over large areas which often translate into important structural differences between monomeric subunits and the mature oligomer. This feature can also impart significant differences in antigenic structure which has been shown for a number of proteins such as the trimeric influenza HA glycoprotein (21) and HIV-1 gp120/gp41 (22) . In addition, some viruses pose significant additional challenges such as antigenic variation of their structural proteins that are important neutralization determinants. Perhaps the best-characterized example of this particular problem is with primary HIV-1 isolates that exist across the many varied HIV-1 subtypes (23) . In efforts to circumvent this issue, further improvements and enhancements in the techniques of phage-displayed antibody library panning have been developed in order to better select for broadly reactive mAbs or for mAbs reactive to particular subunits of a multi-subunit viral glycoprotein such as sequential antigen panning (SAP) and competitive antigen panning (CAP) methodologies (14, 15) .",

In addition, recombinant viral glycoprotein production and affinity purification from stable HeV and NiV soluble F glycoprotein (sF)-secreting 293T cell lines will be detailed. Additional purification and oligomeric analyses methods are also detailed, including size-exclusion gel filtration, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation analysis, and Blue Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) analysis. The design and construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding HIV-1 gp140 and HeV and NiV sG as well as the characterization of the recombinant, soluble, and secreted viral glycoproteins have been detailed elsewhere (24, 40) . In this section for the purposes of additional illustration there will be an emphasis on the production and purification of soluble and secreted forms of the HeV and NiV F glycoprotein, including the analysis of oligomeric characteristics as well as the generation of stable cell lines secreting recombinant sF. 3 3.

Figure 2 .1 show the diagram of the construct of our sF GCN. The vector employed was a promoter-modified pcDNA 3.1 Hygro (\u00fe). The enhanced CMV promoter was imported from phCMV 1 vector that allows high expression level of the human and mouse codon-optimized sF. The Hygromycin selection marker allows the selection of transfected 293T cell which is resistant to the commonly used Geneticin antibiotic. Replacing the C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domain of F is the trimeric GCN4 motif (41, 42) that allows stabilization of the protein trimeric structure (26, 43) and hence enhances the expression and secretion of the protein. This is followed by the 15-amino-acid S-peptide that facilitates purification and immunodetection of the sF by S-protein agarose and anti-S-peptide antibody. A factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) is also engineered upstream to the S-peptide tag allowing removal of the tag by enzymatic digestion. Standard cloning procedures were employed to construct the plasmid.",

Aspirate media from each flask, wash the cells once with sterile PBS, and add 3 ml of trypsin-EDTA per flask.
