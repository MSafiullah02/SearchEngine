The elucidation of the molecular structures of pathogens and the tremendous progress made in immunology as well as developments in proteomics and bioinformatics have led to the identification of protective antigens and ways to deliver them. Together with technological advances, this has caused a move from empirical vaccine development to more rational approaches. A major goal of modern vaccine technology is to fulfill all requirements of the ideal vaccine as summarized in Fig. 22.1, by expressing antigen epitopes (= the smallest molecular structures recognized by the immune system) and/or isolating those antigens that confer an effective immune response and eliminating structures that cause deleterious effects. Thus, better-defined products can be obtained, resulting in improved safety. In addition, modern methodologies may provide simpler production processes for selected vaccine components.\n",

This is effectuated by administration of antigenic components that consist of, are derived from, or are related to the pathogen. The success of vaccination relies on the induction of a protective immune response and a long-lasting immunological memory. Vaccination is also referred to as active immunization, because the host\u2019s immune system is activated to respond to the \u201cinfection\u201d through humoral and cellular immune responses, resulting in adaptive immunity against the particular pathogen. The immune response is generally highly specific: it discriminates not only between pathogen species but often also between different strains within one species (e.g., strains of meningococci, poliovirus, influenza virus). Albeit sometimes a hurdle for vaccine developers, this high specificity of the immune system allows an almost perfect balance between response to foreign antigens and tolerance with respect to self-antigens. Apart from active immunization, administration of specific antibodies can be utilized for short-lived immunological protection of the host. This is termed passive immunization (Fig. 22.2).\n",

Phagocytic cells sense conserved microbial structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). They do this via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface (for bacterial PAMPs) or in the cytoplasm (for viral PAMPs). Examples of PRRs are toll-like receptors (TLRs), scavenger receptors, and C-type lectins (Table 22.2). TLRs consist of a family of receptors, with each member recognizing different patterns of pathogens (Kawai and Akira 2010). TLRs can be found on many cells including macrophages and DCs. DCs can also engulf materials from their extracellular environment by a receptor-independent process called pinocytosis.\n",

Besides antigen-specific binding via their antigen receptors, lymphocytes require co-stimulatory signals via interaction of accessory and co-stimulatory molecules between lymphocytes and APCs. This cell-cell interaction is essential for proper stimulation of lymphocytes, and without those accessory signals, antigen-specific T cells may become anergic. Lymphocytes receiving the appropriate signals for activation will clonally expand and generate multiple progenitors all recognizing the same antigen. Clonal expansion is a typical feature of the adaptive immune system, which will be discussed in more detail below.",

It comprises B and T lymphocytes both bearing antigen-specific receptors. The adaptive immune system can be divided into humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (see Fig. 22.4 and Table 22.3). The humoral response results in antibody formation (but contains cell-mediated events, see Fig. 22.4, panels a, b); CMI results in the generation of cytotoxic cells (see Fig. 22.4, panels a, c). The action of antibodies and T cells is dependent on accessory factors, some of which are mentioned in Table 22.3. In general, after infection with a pathogen or a protective vaccine, both humoral and cellular responses are generated. This indicates that both are needed for efficient protection. The balance between humoral and cellular responses, however, can differ widely between pathogens and is dependent on how the pathogen is presented to the adaptive immune system by APCs. This may have consequences for the design of a particular vaccine (see \u201cVaccine Design in Relation with the Immune Response\u201d).\n\n",

An antibody belongs to one of four different immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, IgA, or IgE) (cf. 10.1007/978-1-4614-6486-0_7). Upon immunization, B cells expressing specific antibodies on their cell surface (representing a fifth immunoglobulin class, IgD) bind intact antigen and are activated. The surface-bound antibodies bind specific epitopes of the pathogen, and in close cooperation with T-helper cells (Th-cells), the B cell becomes activated eventually resulting in massive clonal proliferation. The proliferated B cells are called plasma cells and excrete large amounts of soluble antibodies (Fig. 22.4 panel b). Antibodies are able to prevent infection or disease by several mechanisms:Binding of antibody covers the antigen with Fc (constant fragment), the \u201crear end\u201d of immunoglobulins. Phagocytic cells, like macrophages, express surface receptors for Fc. This allows targeting of the opsonized (antibody-coated) antigen to these cells, followed by enhanced phagocytosis.Immune complexes (i.e., antibodies bound to target antigens) can activate complement, a system of proteins which then becomes cytolytic to bacteria, enveloped viruses, or infected cells.Phagocytic cells may express receptors for complement factors associated with immune complexes. Binding of these activated complement factors enhances phagocytosis.Viruses can be neutralized by antibodies through binding at or near receptor binding sites on the virus surface. This may prevent binding to and entry into the host cell.\n",

Therefore, vaccines should be formulated in such a way that the appropriate Th response will be triggered. This can be done by presenting the antigen in its native format, as is the case for the classical vaccines, or by adding adjuvants that stimulate the desired response (see below).",

Parenteral immunization usually induces systemic immunity. However, mucosal (e.g., oral, intranasal, or intravaginal) immunization may be preferred, because it may induce both mucosal and systemic immunity. Mucosal surfaces are the common entrance of many pathogens, and the induction of a mucosal secretory IgA response may prevent the attachment and entry of pathogens into the host. For example, antibodies against cholera need to be in the gut lumen to inhibit adherence to and colonization of the intestinal wall. Also, orally administered Salmonella typhi not only invades the mucosal lining of the gut but also infects cells of the phagocytic system throughout the body, thereby stimulating the production of both secretory and systemic antibodies, as well as CMI. Additional advantages of mucosal immunization are the ease of administration and the avoidance of systemic side effects (Holmgren and Czerkinsky 2005; Czerkinsky and Holmgren 2012). Up to now, however, successful mucosal immunization has only been achieved with a limited number of oral vaccines (e.g., oral polio, cholera, typhoid fever, and rotavirus vaccines) and a nasal influenza vaccine (FluMist). Most of these vaccines are based on attenuated (see later) versions of the pathogens for which the route of administration is the same as the natural route of infection.",

It has been demonstrated that the products of genes coding for viral envelope proteins can be correctly processed and inserted into the plasma membrane of infected cells. Problems related with the side effects or immunogenicity of vaccinia virus may be circumvented by the use of attenuated strains or poxviruses with a nonhuman natural host.\n",

A number of clinical trials with human adenovirus vectors (HAd5) expressing antigens of Ebola virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as vaccines against these diseases are currently in progress or have been terminated (Nayak and Herzog 2010). In a double-blind, phase II clinical trial to study the effectiveness of a Had5-based vaccine against HIV-1 infection, 3,000 HIV-1 seronegative volunteers were either given the Ad5 vaccine or a placebo. Strikingly, there seemed to be an increased HIV-1 infection rate in the group that had received the Ad5 vaccine (Buchbinder et al. 2008).",

An accurate way of identifying epitopes is to elucidate the crystal structure of antigen-antibody complexes. This is difficult and time consuming, and although crystallography can reveal molecular interactions with unsurpassed detail, the molecular complex likely is much more dynamic in solution. Once the epitope is identified, synthesizing it as a functional peptide has proven to be difficult. The peptides need to be conformationally restrained.

Studies with peptide-based cancer vaccines have shown that these should contain both CD8 and CD4 epitopes in order to elicit a protective immune response. Furthermore, minimal peptides that can be externally loaded on MHC molecules of cells have been shown to induce less robust responses than longer peptides that require intracellular processing after uptake by DCs. Another point to consider is the variable repertoire of MHC molecules in a patient population, implying that a T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine should contain several T-cell epitopes. Following these concepts, clinical trials with overlapping long peptide vaccines have shown promising results in the immunotherapy of patients with HPV-induced malignancies (Melief and van der Burg 2008).",

Besides the synthetic long peptide-based approach already described above, there are several strategies to boost such a tumor-specific CTL response. Vaccines can be prepared from the patient\u2019s tumor itself by mixing irradiated tumor cells or cell extracts with bacterial adjuvants such as BCG to enhance their immunogenicity. Alternatively, heat shock proteins isolated from a patient\u2019s tumor that contain associated tumor antigens can be used as a tumor-specific vaccine. In combination with adjuvants, these heat shock proteins can be very potent in stimulating CTL responses against tumor cells as has been demonstrated in several clinical trials (Liu et al. 2002). Another approach is to genetically alter tumor cells in order to make them more immunogenic. Transfection of tumor cells with the gene encoding the co-stimulatory molecule B7 has resulted in direct activation of tumor-specific CTLs by the transformed tumor cells (Garnett et al. 2006). Similar results can be achieved by transforming tumor cells with gene encoding cytokines (e.g., GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12).",

In order to activate the host immune system against these substances, they need to be conjugated to proteins, such as ovalbumin or diphtheria toxin. This approach has been effective in animal models. Late and mid-stage clinical studies, however, have shown disappointing results.

Animal models are poorly predictive, and even immunological parameters in humans, like the induction of pathogen-neutralizing antibody responses, are not fully predictive. As a result, vaccine efficacy has to be measured in terms of reduction of disease. This is sometimes very difficult because symptoms of a disease can be caused by more than one pathogen (e.g., influenza-like illness). To measure protection, one has to detect the influenza virus in the group with influenza-like illness. In addition, to measure reduction of disease, the groups in the trial need to be very large because it is unknown who will get the disease. Sometimes tens of thousands of people are included in phase 3 trials.",

Which pharmaceutical and immunological conditions have to be fulfilled when formulating combination vaccines?\nAnswersThe characteristics of the ideal vaccine are listed in Fig. 22.1.Antibodies are able to neutralize antigens by at least four mechanisms:Fc-mediated phagocytosisComplement activation resulting in cytolytic activityComplement-mediated phagocytosisCompetitive binding on sites that are crucial for the biological activity of the antigen\nT cells are able to distinguish exogenous from endogenous antigens by the type of self-antigen (MHC antigen) that is associated with processed antigen on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell. Processed antigen binds to MHC molecules, resulting in a cell surface located antigen/MHC complex. The complex is recognized by the T-cell receptor/CD4 or CD8 complex. A cell infected with a virus presents partially degraded viral antigen (i.e., endogenous antigen) complexed with class I MHC. The complex is recognized by CD8-positive T cells, resulting in the induction of cytotoxic T cells. Professional antigen-presenting cells like macrophages phagocytose exogenous antigen and present it in conjunction with class II MHC. CD4-positive T cells bind to the MHC-antigen complex. Subsequent B-cell or macrophage activation leads to antibody or inflammatory responses, respectively.Classical vaccines consist of either live attenuated vaccines or nonliving vaccines. For nonliving vaccines, we discern three generations. The first generation comprises suspensions of inactivated, pathogenic organisms. Second-generation vaccines contain purified components, varying from whole organisms or extracts of organisms to purified single components. Third-generation vaccines are either well-defined mixtures of purified components or protective components formulated in an immunogenic presentation form. Examples of these categories are given in Table 22.4.The first problem concerns the low immunogenicity of plain peptide vaccines. The immunogenicity can be improved by constructing multiple antigen peptides or by chemical coupling of peptides to carrier proteins. Alternatively, peptide epitopes can be incorporated into carrier proteins through genetic fusion of the peptide DNA with that of the carrier protein. The second problem of peptide antigens is that their conformation does not necessarily correspond to that of the epitope in the native protein, which in case of B-cell epitopes may lead to poor immune responses or responses to irrelevant peptide conformations. Solutions to this problem are sought in constraining the conformation of the synthetic peptide by chemical cyclization methods.The advantages and disadvantages of nucleic acid vaccines are listed in Table 22.6. An advantage of RNA is that there is no risk of incorporation into host DNA. On the other hand, RNA is less stable than DNA.The three production stages are (a) cultivation of cells and/or virus, (b) purification of the desired components, and (c) formulation of the vaccine.Examples of combination vaccines include diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis(\u2212polio) vaccines and measles-mumps-rubella(\u2212varicella) vaccines. Prerequisites for combining vaccine components are:Pharmaceutical compatibility of vaccine components and additivesCompatibility of immunization schedulesNo interference between immune responses to individual components\n\n",

Upon subcutaneous or intramuscular administration, the vaccine components are taken up by phagocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in the peripheral tissue and express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have taken up antigens become activated and start migrating towards nearby lymph nodes. Inside the lymph nodes, the antigen processed by the APCs is presented to lymphocytes, which, when recognizing the antigen and receiving the appropriate co-stimulatory signals, become activated. These antigen-specific B and T lymphocytes clonally expand to produce multiple progenitors recognizing the same antigen. In addition, memory B and T cells are formed that provide long-term (sometimes lifelong) protection against infection with the pathogen.",

An antigen-presenting cell (APC), e.g., a dendritic cell, phagocytozes exogenous antigens (bacteria or soluble antigens) and degrades them partially. Antigen fragments are presented by MHC class II molecules to a CD4-positive Th-cell; the MHC-antigen complex on the APC is recognized by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD4 molecules on the Th-cell. The APC-Th-cell interaction leads to activation of the Th-cell. The activated Th-cell produces cytokines, resulting in the activation of macrophages (Th1 help), B cells (Th2 help; panel b), or cytotoxic T cells (panel c). (b) Antibody production. The presence of antigen and Th2-type cytokines causes proliferation and differentiation of B cells. Only B cells specific for the antigen become activated. The B cells, now called plasma cells, produce and secrete large amounts of antibody. Some B cells differentiate into memory cells. (c) Activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs recognize nonself antigens expressed by MHC class I molecules on the surface of virally infected cells or tumor cells. Cytolytic proteins are produced by the CTL upon interaction with the target cell.",
