            "text": "1. Further detail on assembly and screening of \"NITD parasite box\". In previous work we have screened several large compound libraries against blood stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites and identified a number of novel active scaffolds and successfully advanced two new antimalarial drug candidates to the clinic 36 . Our P. falciparum phenotypic screening efforts identified multiple new targets including the ATP-dependent sodium channel PfATP4 9 , phosphatidylinositol-4-OH-kinase 12 , and lysyl-tRNA synthetase 37 . While Cryptosporidium is an early branching member of the Apicomplexa and exhibits phylogenetic divergence from other members of the phylum, several druggable targets are conserved 38,39 . To explore functional conservation of targets and pathways across parasites and to identify lead candidates against Cryptosporidium, we have assembled a \"NITD parasite box\" and screened it against C. parvum as described in the Supplementary Table 1. The \"NITD parasite box\" is a diversity set of 6220 non-cytotoxic (HepG2 SI > 20) and non-reactive compounds identified in a variety of antiparasitic drug discovery projects among them P. falciparum phenotypic screening hits and compounds from 11 diverse scaffolds both active and inactive hits against P. falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei that inhibit the growth/viability of C. parvum in HCT-8 cells. During the screening the average infection rate of HCT-8 cells was 69% and the average z-factor of 0.74 compared to uninfected controls. We have observed a positive correlation between two replicates with an r 2 of the regression 0.831. The scatter plot of 6220 compounds with mean % inhibition is shown Fig 1a. We identified 154 new chemical entities (NCEs) that inhibited C. parvum infection by more than 3x SD from the mean of DMSO-treated controls, resulting in a 2.5 % hit rate. These 154 hits represented multiple compounds from Pf phenotypic screening hits and a few scaffolds active against PfPI(4)K, PfKRS etc. None of the Trypanosoma active hits showed activity against C. parvum. In this manuscript we focused our efforts on the pyrazolopyridine scaffold.",

Upon development of joint infection, calf N108 was removed from PK sampling. Calf N109 exited the study prior to the cessation of fecal oocyst shedding. There were no significant differences in fecal oocyst shedding (two-tailed P = 0.9), fecal consistency score (two-tailed P = 0.6), or dehydration score (two-tailed P = 0.8) between KDU731-treated calves that developed a co-morbidity and those that did not. All calves were in excellent post mortem state with adequate amounts of abdominal adipose tissue except for the typical cryptosporidiosis condition. There is no evidence of toxicity in association with treatment in the skeletal muscle (diaphragm, tongue), lymphoid tissue (ileocecal lymph node, spleen), liver, kidney and heart.",

These mutants showed a copy number variation and in some cases point-mutations in the molecular target (PfPI4K H1484Y and PfPI4K S1320L). To evaluate the role of homologous CpPI(4)K residues (CpPI4K-H1037Y and CpPI4K-S871L) in interactions with pyrazolopyridines, we engineered mutant forms of the CpPI4K enzyme. KDU731 inhibited CpPI4K-H1037Y and CpPI4K-S871L enzymes with an IC 50 of 11 \u00b1 1.9 nM and 8.5 \u00b1 0.2 nM respectively, compared to 13.7 \u00b1 6.5 nM for the wild type CpPI(4)K in the same experiment.

Though GI exposure is good enough for efficacy, ideally we need systemic exposure to demonstrate safety. KDU731 in solid dispersion (SD) significantly enhanced systemic exposure in rats compared to suspension formulation (Extended Data Table 3 ). Hence, SD formulation was used to demonstrate in vivo safety in 2 weeks rat toxicology studies with KDU731. All rats were monitored for changes in body weight, food consumption and organs weight; and clinical and histopathological analyses were undertaken. All rats tolerated oral administration of KDU731 (30 and 100 mg/kg) daily for 14 days with no mortality and no drugrelated changes food consumption or body weight gain were observed. Toxicokinetic studies revealed that no accumulation of KDU731 was observed after repeated administration for 14 days. No significant differences in hematology parameters were observed between the KDU731 treated and control groups with the exception of a minor increase in red blood cells (RBC) count. A slight elevation in cholesterol and phosphate ions and a decrease in glucose levels were observed in 100 mg/kg KDU731 treated group. No other significant changes in the blood chemistry parameters were observed. Overall, clinical chemistry and hematology findings at 100 mg/kg were minor and monitorable. Minimal to slight pathological changes were detected in both the vehicle and high-dose groups, and no obvious pathological changes directly related to the test agent were found. Overall, under the study conditions KDU731 at 30 mg/kg/day is considered as the NOEL (no observable effect level).",
