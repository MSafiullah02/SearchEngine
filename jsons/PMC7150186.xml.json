It is well known as part of the common flora on the skin and mucous membranes of mammals and approximately 20%\u201330% of humans are persistently colonized with S. aureus, mainly by mostly susceptible human-adapted isolates. In contrast, colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is rare, predominantly transient and associated with prior contact to the health care system. Additionally, in recent years, community and livestock-associated S. aureus clones contributed to colonization in humans, latter especially in those working in close contact to farm animals.",

A considerable percentage of colonizing S. aureus isolates is equipped with enterotoxin genes. Humans carrying enterotoxigenic isolates represent a contamination source when handling food, thus generating a continuous risk of S. aureus food intoxication. While the majority of pathogens causing foodborne diseases infect humans (including workers in the food industry) and lead to symptomatic disease, staphylococci are resident skin inhabitants, putatively constituting a part of the skin microbiome. As such they largely remain unrecognized, until they become visible during the course of outbreak investigations related to epidemiologically linked cases of staphylococcal disease such as SFP (Todd et al., 2008).",

However, because of the widespread occurrence of enterotoxigenic strains as human colonizers and the often transient nature of colonization the source of contamination cannot always be identified unambiguously. Therefore, compliance with hygiene measures is the most important requirement to prevent food contamination by both, human colonization and environmental S. aureus reservoirs.\n",

In the US prevalences around 30% were documented (Kuehnert et al., 2006, Mainous et al., 2006, Gorwitz et al., 2008). Similar rates were found among the healthy Japanese population (Uemura et al., 2004), whereas the nasal carriage rate in a Chinese study was reported to be only 23% (Ma et al., 2011). For South and South East Asia quite variable carriage rates have been found, ranging from below 10% to more than 50% (Saxena and Panhotra, 2003, Anwar et al., 2004, Erdenizmenli et al., 2004, Lu et al., 2005, Choi et al., 2006, Severin et al., 2008, Chatterjee et al., 2009). For Australia a nasal colonization rate around 30% has been reported (Vlack et al., 2006, Munckhof et al., 2008). Recent reports from Africa also showed variable colonization rates ranging from around 10% to 30% (Adesida et al., 2007, Ben Slama et al., 2011; Ateba Ngoa et al., 2012, Omuse et al., 2012, Ouedraogo et al., 2016). In South America rather high carriage rates between 30% and 60% were reported (Hamdan-Partida et al., 2010, Ruimy et al., 2010). In several studies nasal carriage was associated with male sex and younger age (Skramm et al., 2011, Gorwitz et al., 2008, Holtfreter et al., 2016); however, in general, several different factors contribute to S. aureus carriage including those associated with the host, the pathogen itself, and the environment (Mulcahy and McLoughlin, 2016, Kluytmans et al., 1997).",

Depending on geographic region and study design 0%\u201335% of individuals are colonized with MRSA. For nine countries in Central Europe den Heijer et al. (2013) reported low MRSA prevalence in the healthy community from 0.0% (Sweden) to 2.1% (Belgium). Other studies from Europe showed similar colonization rates (Sakwinska et al., 2009, Lozano et al., 2011, Mehraj et al., 2014, Holtfreter et al., 2016). Similar or slightly elevated carriage rates were also reported in studies from Australia and several Asian countries (Munckhof et al., 2008, Chatterjee et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2013). Significantly higher rates were recorded in Southern European countries and the United States (up to 35%, Tavares et al., 2013, Champion et al., 2014). MRSA carriage rates are usually higher in children (Creech et al., 2005, Braga et al., 2014, Rodriguez et al., 2014); additionally, certain risk factors related to contact to health care institutions increase the probability of MRSA, particularly HA-MRSA carriage; these include contact to HA-MRSA positive patients, antibiotic therapy, hospitalization, or even contact with the health care system either as visitor or employee (Hardy et al., 2004, Coia et al., 2006). HA-MRSA, frequently exhibit multidrug-resistant phenotypes.",

CA-MRSA colonize individuals independent of risk factors mentioned before; they cause a growing number of uncomplicated to severe skin and soft tissue infections but can also lead to serious invasive infections such as necrotizing pneumonia or fasciitis. Although CA-MRSA are still rare in the general population in Europe (Sangvik et al., 2011, Lozano et al., 2011, Sakwinska et al., 2009, Monecke et al., 2009, Ruimy et al., 2009), they represent a major threat to human health in the United States, where they became endemic by now (Seybold et al., 2006, Maree et al., 2007). However, elevated rates of CA-MRSA colonization were also reported from Southern Europe and the Middle East [11.4% (Tavares et al., 2013)]. The reason for the increased virulence potential of CA-MRSA is still controversially discussed; the frequent occurrence of Panton\u2013Valentine leukocidin (PVL) in CA-MRSA strains is supposed to be a contributing factor but others are under discussion (Voyich et al., 2006, Labandeira-Rey et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2007). Most probably, the acquisition of new virulence and fitness determinants together with an altered gene expression of common virulence genes and alterations in protein sequence that increase fitness are involved (Thurlow et al., 2012). CA-MRSA are usually only resistant to few antibiotics.",

Within these CCs several lineages evolved independently over time at different geographic locations.

(2007) who investigated more than 200 S. aureus isolates from nasal colonization and from bacteremia cases for the presence of superantigen genes including enterotoxin genes in dependence of clonal lineage. Although they observed remarkably variable virulence profiles within each S. aureus CC, each lineage was characterized by a typical repertoire of superantigen toxin genes. For example, the egc-cluster enterotoxins, which cluster on the S. aureus genomic island vSA\u03b2, were present in all CC5, CC22, and CC45 isolates but completely absent from CC8, CC12, CC15, and CC395. Moreover, an egc variant was almost exclusively linked to the CC30 background. Other enterotoxin genes with very strong linkage to certain CCs were sec-sel, and sed-sej-ser, they are colocalized on the pathogenicity island SaPI3 and were detected mainly in CC45 isolates, whereas the plasmid-borne enterotoxin genes sed-sej-ser were usually found in CC8. Enterotoxins with a broader distribution were the phage-borne sea, which was occasionally detected in CC8, -30, -45, and -395, and seb, on SaPI, which was infrequently found in CC5, -8, -12, -25, and -45. Similar gene distributions were also described by van Trijp et al. (2010) for strains from carriers with autologous invasive infection and by Monecke et al. (2011) for an S. aureus collection encompassing strains from a variety of different clonal lineages. Similar to MSSA and HA-MRSA lineages, common CA-MRSA harbor a lineage specific repertoire of enterotoxin genes; additionally, CA-MRSA lineages frequently harbor the genes for PVL (Diep et al., 2006, Tenover et al., 2006, El Garch et al., 2009, Shukla et al., 2010, Monecke et al., 2011, Portillo et al., 2013, Shore et al., 2014).",

Interestingly, the same group found no overlap in clonal lineages and virulence gene pattern for SFP isolates and isolates obtained from milk or pork, suggesting that pork or bovine mastitis milk do not represent the most common sources of SFP (Johler et al., 2011, Baumgartner et al., 2014).

Many of the studies cited previously in this chapter could link high carriage rates to a lack of personal and kitchen hygiene. Especially in developing countries training in food hygiene and safety often was shown to be insufficient.\u2022The real incidence of SFP is probably underestimated, which is due to several reasons, including unreported minor outbreaks, improper sample collection, and laboratory examination (Argudin et al., 2010).\n",

Another SFP outbreak reported recently was caused by an enterotoxin A and I producing strain, which was introduced most likely by a food handler (Gallina et al., 2013). Similarly, Wei et al. were able to trace back enterotoxigenic outbreak strains carrying sea and seb, respectively, to the hand lesion of a food handler in a cafeteria (Wei and Chiou, 2002). However, in a large percentage of outbreaks the initial source of contamination remains unknown. This might be due to the fact that carriage is often transient and might not be detected at the time of epidemiological investigations, which take place sometime after contamination of food.",

            "text": "Two Dutch studies documented an increased nasal MRSA carriage rate (3.2%\u20135.6%) in pig slaughterhouse workers in The Netherlands (Van Cleef et al., 2010, Gilbert et al., 2012). Colonization was predominantly due to LA-MRSA of CC398, which is the predominant LA-MRSA lineage among Dutch pigs. The colonization rates reported were significantly higher than the general population prevalence in The Netherlands (Wertheim et al., 2004), although they were much lower than reported from pig farmers or veterinarians with daily exposure to livestock (Cuny et al., 2009). Working with live pigs was shown to be the most important risk factor for colonization, although environmental contamination might also have played a role in the acquisition of MRSA. Mulders et al. (2010) found very similar results for the poultry food chain in The Netherlands. However, in contrast to the studies previously mentioned, LA-MRSA of the poultry-associated ST9 were frequently obtained from animals and workers in addition to CC398. LA-MRSA CC398 and ST9 were also isolated from broiler chickens and abattoir workers in Germany (Wendlandt et al., 2013a). Normanno et al. (2015) found nasal MRSA carriage in \u223c9% of abattoir workers screened in two industrial abattoirs in Southern Italy; MRSA strains isolated were more heterogeneous, but reflected the MRSA population isolated from slaughtered pigs during the same study, and included LA-MRSA isolates from CC398, CC1, and CC8.",

            "text": "\nGilbert et al. (2012) demonstrated that occupational exposure to MRSA decreased along the slaughter line, accompanied by a reduced risk of carriage for workers employed. However, on the other hand high MRSA contamination levels of retail meat were reported from several geographic regions (de Boer et al., 2009, Kluytmans, 2010, Wendlandt et al., 2013b, Tenhagen et al., 2014, Kraushaar and Fetsch, 2014, Fetsch et al., 2017). To determine to what extent butchers and other food handlers exposed to raw meat are at increased risk of colonization with S. aureus and MRSA, several studies were conducted focusing on these individuals. Boost et al. (2013) investigated nasal colonization in 300 pork butchers at traditional \u201cwet markets\u201d throughout Hong Kong, dealing with fresh meat as well as carcasses, which may increase the risk of contamination, especially if protective clothing is not worn. They found an MRSA colonization rate of 5.6% in butchers, consisting of 2.3% of individuals colonized by non-LA-MRSA and 3.3% by LA-MRSA, which was considerably higher than in the general population in Hong Kong. The majority of LA-MRSA belonged to CC9, which was previously reported from pig carcasses in Hong Kong (Guardabassi et al., 2009, Ho et al., 2012), suggesting cross-contamination from carcasses to fresh meat and workers. In contrast, de Jonge et al. (2010) found no MRSA among 95 employees working in the Dutch cold meat processing industry and in institutional kitchens, although 31 participants (33%) were colonized with MSSA. Boost et al. attributed this difference to the higher level of automation associated with improved hygiene standards in the Dutch meat processing industry in comparison to the traditional butchering process at Hong Kong wet markets.",

Overall 22.8% of food handlers were colonized, but colonization rate was significantly higher in workers handling raw meat (30%), indicating an increased risk for colonization depending on regular exposition to raw meat. However, colonization rate was still in a range previously reported for the general public in Hong Kong and elsewhere (Zhang et al., 2011). A diverse range of clonal lineages was detected among MSSA isolates, also including clonal lineages previously associated with livestock (ST5, ST1, ST9, ST130, ST97, ST398); however, the majority of isolates belonged to clonal lineages common in human nasal colonization. Only five out of 99 S. aureus isolates were MRSA resulting in an MRSA colonization rate of 1.2%, which is comparable to the local MRSA colonization rate previously reported (Zhang et al., 2011); all MRSA isolates belonged to clonal lineage CC45, which represents the predominant HA-MRSA in Hong Kong (Ho et al., 2009, Gruteke et al., 2015) and was not previously associated with livestock indicating human rather than animal origin.",

(2015b) conducted a longitudinal study of nasal colonization and hand contamination of food handlers with S. aureus starting in 2002 and lasting until 2011. Within this time frame hygiene measures were strictly implemented in 2003 in Hong Kong because of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The study started in 2002 with samples from 619 food handlers at 15 catering establishments, including supermarkets, canteens, and centralized kitchens serving hospitals and sporting facilities. Fourteen of these premises were revisited in 2003 and a further 527 samples were taken; 499 participants were sampled at both occasions. In 2011, 434 food handlers were sampled from six large catering establishments, similar to those mentioned above. In 2002 the authors found a nasal carriage rate of 35% and a hand contamination rate of 41%; in 2003 both, nasal and hand colonization rates were significantly reduced to 24% and 12%, respectively. In 2011 the nasal carriage rate remained stable (23%), whereas the hand contamination rate was further reduced to 4%. Most hand contamination was attributable to nasal isolates of persistently colonized (co-) workers who had presumably contaminated the environment (Ho et al., 2015c). Handling of cooked and raw meat was shown to increase the risk for colonization, as already previously anticipated (Ho et al., 2014). MRSA carriage was found in 1.2% in 2011 compared with 0.6% and 0.8% in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Spa-typing of isolates revealed a high diversity with isolates of clonal lineages ST188, CC15, and CC30 predominating and indicated a certain strain dynamic over time. Although MRSA isolates were diverse in 2002 and 2003, they were dominated by isolates of t1081/CC45, which was also the most common HA-MRSA in Hong Kong (Gruteke et al., 2015, Ho et al., 2009). Typing also enabled to estimate the rate of persistent carriers (18%). The considerable decrease in colonization rates, which was mainly due to a reduction of transient carriers, was attributed to the enhanced hygiene practices implemented during the SARS epidemic. These included, for example, the mandatory use of gloves and masks and the increased emphasis on hand hygiene in food handlers. Carriage rates were similar to those reported from the general population over the same time span (O'Donoghue and Boost, 2004, Zhang et al., 2011). Isolates originating from the study were subsequently analyzed for the presence of enterotoxin genes sea to sej, sek to ser and selu, ses, and set (Ho et al., 2015a). Enterotoxin and enterotoxin-like genes were detected in 83%, 82%, and 80% of isolates, respectively. They were more often detected in isolates of persistent carriers, with sea, seb, and sem found to be statistically associated with persistent carriage. The most common enterotoxin genes were those associated with the egc-cluster; however, of the classical enterotoxin genes, sea and see were most prevalent. In contrast to other studies (Holtfreter et al., 2007) no association was found between clonal lineage and the presence of enterotoxin determinants.",

(1996) screened 500 restaurant workers in 100 restaurants of Kuwait City and found an S. aureus nasal carriage rate of 26.6%, which was low in comparison to the general public and the hospital population in the same region; they also looked for the strains ability of enterotoxin A\u2013D production and found that 86.6% of isolates were able to produce either one or a combination of several toxins, with enterotoxin A and B being most prevalent. In a later study Udo et al. (2009) characterized 200 isolates obtained from nasal, skin, stool, and throat swaps from 250 food handlers working in 50 different restaurants in Kuwait City. Workers were sampled during mandatory screening or in context of outbreak associated epidemiological investigations. The authors found a much higher colonization rate (53.2%) than in the previous study; further (molecular) characterization revealed highly diverse strains and 92.5% of isolates expressing antibacterial resistance; two-third were unsusceptible to at least two different bacterial agents, and 23% were multidrug resistant, including one MRSA isolate. 71% of isolates were positive for enterotoxin genes (sea to sei), with sei being the most prevalent gene, and almost two-third of enterotoxigenic isolates carried more than one enterotoxin gene. Additionally, the authors found genes for PVL in 9% of the isolates, including the MRSA isolate indicating the presence of CA-MRSA.",

For instance, employees working at the beginning of the food chain are at increased risk for carrying MRSA, especially if they are handling living animal. MRSA carriage in these individuals is mostly associated with LA-MRSA lineages present in the respective animal population. However, LA-MRSA carriage rate is significantly lower in food industry workers in comparison to farmers, veterinarians, etc. Nevertheless, it implies a certain risk for endogenous MRSA infections and for spreading LA-MRSA to the worker\u2019s household members. Data on MRSA and MSSA carriage in butchers are controversial. The probability of MRSA colonization seems to be associated with the degree of automation within the slaughter process as increased automation also implies improved hygiene standards. MRSA lineages found in these individuals mostly include LA-MRSA, however, colonization with CA-MRSA was also reported. Carriage is most probably associated with insufficient hygiene measures during handling of raw meat and in personal hygiene. Additionally, a few studies also report a slightly increased risk for MSSA colonization.",

It is anticipated that persistently colonized individuals contaminate their hands as well as the environment and serve as the source for hand contamination of noncarriers. Unfortunately, most studies did not include comparable typing data for carriage isolates. However, existing typing data together with resistance and enterotoxin gene profiles indicate that MSSA carriage in food handling individuals is highly diverse and is due to the same clonal lineages as in the general population within a given geographic region. However, this implies that food handlers might also be colonized with CA-MRSA strains, which can be spread via the food chain because of improper personal and process hygiene. As a consequence, compliance with hygiene measures is the most important prerequisite to prevent food contamination by both, human and environmental S. aureus reservoirs.",
