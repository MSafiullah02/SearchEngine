Several studies have identified common characteristics of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, including epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and treatment data [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been classified as the b-coronavirus 2b lineage and has characteristics typical of the coronavirus family 6 . A recent study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to another coronavirus carried by bats, leading to speculation that the novel virus may be hosted in bats 7 . Current evidence suggests that wild animals illegally traded in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market were the likely culprit of the spread of the virus among humans 8 .",

It has been reported that COVID-19 infections are clustered within groups of individuals in close contact in places such as supermarkets, public transportation, and hospitals 10 . Patients with severe fractures often require hospitalization and surgical treatment, making this population susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Thus, the question arises concerning the best medical practices for patients who have both fracture and COVID-19 infection at the time of presentation. There is an urgent need to determine whether patients with fracture who are affected by COVID-19 have a higher risk of mortality because of the infection. The purpose of the present retrospective study was to analyze the clinical data for 10 hospitalized patients with both a fracture and COVID-19 infection and to identify the most appropriate management strategy.",

At the same time, most patients with hip fracture are older, many are in relatively poor physical condition, and many have underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease 15, 16 . Such patients generally are advised to undergo surgical treatment as soon as possible. This approach not only promotes fracture-healing and facilitates recovery of mobility but also reduces various complications, such as the onset of pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis 17 . If surgical treatment is not possible, these patients must remain in bed for 8 to 12 weeks, and, because of pain and the use of traction, most have to lie flat without being able to roll over, let alone stand. The stress associated with the fracture and surgical treatment can trigger a series of oxidative stress responses and excessive inflammation 18 . These reactions upregulate the expression of a series of inflammatory factors and decrease the immunity of the patients, increasing the likelihood of pneumonia 19 . Postoperative pulmonary complications have been reported to occur in 4.9% of patients after the surgical treatment of a hip fracture 20 . Wong et al. reported the case of an 81-year-old woman with an intertrochanteric fracture and SARS who died 7 days after surgery 21 . In the present study, 1 patient (Case 7) died 11 days after surgery and 3 patients (Cases 3, 6, and 9) died 8 days after admission without surgery being performed. Considering the high mortality of patients with COVID-19, surgical treatment for patients with both a fracture and COVID-19 should be carefully planned in advance. Furthermore, particular attention should be given to such patients after the surgical treatment of the fracture because of possibility of rapid deterioration of their condition.",

Laboratory tests suggested that lymphopenia was more likely to occur in patients with a fracture. Additionally, compared with the data in published articles on COVID-19, the median neutrophil count and D-dimer were higher than the upper normal limits of the corresponding indicators, which could represent the special laboratory characteristics of fractures in patients with COVID-19 (see Appendix Table II) . qRT-PCR demonstrated that 3 patients (Cases 1, 2, and 5) were negative The present study documented that patients with a fracture may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. Seven of the 10 patients had a nosocomial infection. It is therefore essential to adopt strict infection-control measures. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmitted directly by contact or by aerosol. Doctors, nurses, patients, and families should be wearing protective devices such as an N95 respirator and goggles.",

First, nonoperative treatment should be considered for older patients with fractures, such as distal radial fractures, in endemic areas. Second, strict infection-control measures should be implemented for patients with fractures, particularly those undergoing surgical treatment. Third, patients with a fracture and COVID-19 pneumonia should be given more intensive surveillance and treatment. Fourth, surgical treatment for patients with a fracture and COVID-19 pneumonia should be performed in a negative-pressure operating room.",
