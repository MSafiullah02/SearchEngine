T lymphocytes, B cells and NK cells would be used for detecting serum samples collected from 34 SFTS cases and 20 healthy donors. We found that CD3? and CD4? T lymphocytes were significantly diminished in SFTS compared to normal control. In contrast, the percentage of NK cells was elevated. Further analysis revealed that the number of CD3? and CD4? T lymphocytes showed that there was a more robust pattern of depression in acute phase and severe SFTS infection compared to the patients in recovery phase and mild SFTS infection. But NK cells were significantly increased in acute phase and severe SFTS. They reverted to the near normal levels in convalescent phase. Additionally, the levels of CD3? and CD4? T lymphocytes progressively decreased in death group when compared with the survival group, but the level of B cells was higher. The damages of immune system were obvious, and the immune dysfunction might be partly responsible for disease progression of patients with SFTSV infection.",

Some authors had found that SFTS patients were at least partly immune-mediated, which might play an important role in determining the severity and clinical outcome [10] . Lymphocyte played an important role in the induction of cellular immunity in organism. Dysfunction of lymphocyte subsets caused immunofunction abnormality, which made disease deteriorate progressively and protractedly. Lymphocytes could stimulate the organism to produce immune response against viral antigens when organism was infected with SFTSV. It is clear that many viruses encode specific gene products that antagonize the immune response in recent years [11, 12] . Therefore, figuring out how SFTSV interacts with the host immune system is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of SFTS. Until recently, immunofunction and lymphocyte subpopulation studies with respects to SFTSV infection are insufficient. We analyzed T-cell subgroups and their possible roles in SFTS disease.",

Serum samples from 20 healthy volunteers (who neither suffer from any disease nor take medicine in recent weeks) were normal control, and we divided SFTS patients into different groups based on consistent clinical features. The serum samples of the acute phase of the patients were collected in an initial week, and after 2 weeks, they were in recovery phase.

The analysis showed that the expression levels of CD3? and CD4? in the convalescent phase increased to the near normal levels (Fig. 2a) . But the level of NK cells in the convalescent phase decreased compared to that in the acute phase. In contrast, when the condition of SFTS patients progressed from mildness to severity, the contents of CD3? and CD4? diminished gradually. And an impressive level elevation of NK cell was presented in severe SFTS patients (Fig. 2b) . These dynamic analyses indicated that the immunofunction that back to physiological range was associated with the recovery and the mild state of SFTS disease.",

The characteristics were more obvious for patients in acute phase and severe SFTS than that in recovery phase and mild SFTS. Those physiological balance of laboratory parameters was substantially altered in acute phase and returned to physiological ranges during the recovery phase. It had been shown that innate immune responses determined the pathogenesis of SFTS, as well as high level of viral replication [10] . The amount of lymphocyte and its subsets was stable relatively in peripheral blood and tissue. And lymphocyte produced moderate immune response, which could eliminate foreign antigen without injuring intracorporal organism. But the balance was broken when SFTSV invaded and the amount of lymphocytic subpopulations changed. Our study showed that the expression level of lymphocyte subsets was abnormal in the peripheral blood of SFTS, especially in acute phase and severe SFTS patients.",

The leukocyte count in SFTS was less than 4 9 10 9 /L, and the average level was 2.86 \u00b1 1.56 9 10 9 /L. While the proportion of lymphocytes was decreased in acute and severe SFTS patients, together with these data, we found that activated T cells played a crucial role in the pathophysiology of SFTS since the main proportions of lymphocytes in peripheral blood were changed. The total number of T cells in SFTS patients decreased significantly and the decline in the number of CD3? T lymphocytes prompted that the number of active cells was insufficient to participate in cellular immune response, and then, the cellular immune function was low in SFTS patients. The expression of CD4? on T cells was obviously reduced in SFTS, which made the function of immune globulin downgrade. At the same time, we also found that the percentage of NK cells was significantly high. It was well known that NK cells were classified as lymphocytes on the basis of their morphology, expression of lymphoid markers and common origin. NK cells had been shown in humans and mice to participate in the early control against virus infection [15] . NK cells could kill virally infected or transformed cells [16] . Therefore, NK cells were highly important for the pathogenesis of SFTS disease progression.",

In acute phase, the leukocyte count was less than 4 9 10 9 /L, and it gradually returned to normal level in convalescence phase, while the leukocyte count was 2-4 9 10 9 /L in mild SFTS patients, and it was less than 2 9 10 9 /L in severe SFTSV infection. The percentages of CD3? and CD4? were significantly lower in the acute phase and severe SFTSV infection than those in recovery phase and mild SFTSV infection. The balance of immunocytes was broken and lymphocytopenia took place due to the effects of multiple stimuli. Li et al. [17] found that CD4? T lymphocytes had a sharp decline in the research of severe acute respiratory syndromes (ARDS), which resulted in the damage of cellular immune function. CD4? T lymphocytes could induce the virus specificity cytotoxic T cell forming specific polyclone immunity and assist B cell to produce neutralizing antibody, which made key roles in incubation period and acute phase when virus infected. We presumed that the reasons for the reduction of CD3? and CD4? T cells in acute and severe SFTS were as follows: firstly, T lymphocytes which struggled with SFTSV avoided fierce injuries to the organism; secondly, complicated immune made T lymphocytes damage and weakened the ability of immune response in the urgent condition of disease [18] . In contrast to T cells, we found that the count of NK cells was showed to increase, and the differences were statistically significant in acute and severe cases. NK cells, as components of innate immune defense, could directly induce the death of virus-infected cells in the absence of specific immunization, such as cellular immune. NK cells possessed immunoregulatory functions since they secreted cytokines such as IFN-c, TNF-a, IL-10 and G-CSF. These inflammatory cytokines and chemokines played roles in the pathogenesis of virus infection, and the levels of them were related to the severity of the illness [19, 20] . Simultaneously, NK cells might exacerbate the disease by releasing multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines or damaging the affected tissues through direct cytotoxicity [21] . It had been found that the level of IFN-c increased in fatal SFTS cases [20] , and IFN-c could induce apoptosis of lymphocytes [22] . This might be one of the possible mechanisms of lymphocytopenia in SFTS patients due to direct and indirect attack of SFTSV. Therefore, we inferred that NK cells educed main roles against SFTSV infection when cellular immune function was weakened obviously. However, the indicators would rise again obviously during the recovery phase, which prompted that it was temporary for the cell immunosuppression resulting from SFTSV infection.",

Moreover, as the SFTS disease developed, the level of T leukocyte count was progressively diminished, and there was a more significant decline in the expression of CD3? and CD4? T cells. Th1 was the positive cell in CD4? T lymphocytes, and SFTSV triggered the immune system mechanisms mainly by stimulating the Th1 cells to produce immune responses against the viruses [21] . Deng et al . [21] had demonstrated that SFTSV activated mainly Th1 immune response against viral invasion. The decline of CD4? T lymphocytes caused the suppression of immunofunction, which might aggravate the patient's condition. At the same time, we found that the percentage of B cells in death cases was significantly higher than that in the survival cases. It might indicate that humoral immunity could be activated when patient's condition was extremely serious, and then, humoral immunity produced antibody to develop the neutralization and enhance the phagocytosis. The immunofunction was extremely low in severe SFTS that increased the risk of secondary infection. However, the difference in the lymphocyte subgroups might not be helpful to judge the prognosis of death and survival owing to higher variations and lower case numbers.",
