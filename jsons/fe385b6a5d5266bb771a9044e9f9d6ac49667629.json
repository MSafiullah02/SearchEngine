The most common reported symptoms were fatigue, myalgia, fever, cough, and chills. The median duration of symptoms before swab collection was 4 days; 9 participants (36%) had had symptoms for less than 2 days at time of swab collection. Coinfection with another respiratory virus was present in 4 cases (16%).",

            "text": "The first Covid-19 case detected through the Seattle Flu Study, in a specimen collected on February 24, 2020, was the first documented U.S. case of community transmission at the time. 3 These results initiated assessment of the spread of the virus in the Seattle region, which in turn accelerated public health efforts to mitigate the emerging pandemic. 4 As the Covid-19 pandemic progresses, widespread implementation of simple methods that are scalable and require minimal interaction for collection of samples from persons who may not seek clinical care is critical for early detection of community cases. Looking beyond the current crisis, we envision ubiquitous, community-based sampling for respiratory illnesses as essential infrastructure for early detection and mitigation of future pandemics. Panel A shows SARS-CoV-2 tests over time, further stratified according to age group; detection of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results over time and as a percentage of the total number of tests run; and Covid-19-positive case counts over time. Panel B shows cycle threshold values from a laboratory-developed multiplex quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) assay as a function of days elapsed from swab collection to freezing or nucleic acid extraction for virus detection, shown separately for SARS-CoV-2, other respiratory viruses, and RNase P, a human cellular marker. The horizontal line in each box represents the median, the lower and upper boundaries of the boxes the interquartile range, and the ends of the vertical lines 1.5 times the interquartile range. Individual points represent outliers (>1.5 times the interquartile range). ",
