The animals are native to the Atlantic coastal forests in northeastern Brazil, but the supply for research comes from National Primate Research Centers, pharmaceutical companies, and breeding facilities [1]. It is small in size with adults weighing 350\u2013400 g. The lifespan of marmosets is relatively compact compared to other nonhuman primates (NHPs), with animals reaching maturity by 18\u201324 months of age, producing offspring by three years of age and reaching old age by 8 years of age [2]. The compressed lifespan of the marmoset is attractive in scientific research because the number of marmosets available for research can be scaled up quickly when the need arises and then naturally reduced when large numbers of animals are not needed [1, 3\u2022\u2022].",

Because of the high morbidity they induce and the lack of approved vaccines and therapies, many of these viruses can only be handled safely using Biosafety level 4 practices. Disease severity, imported cases of disease from patients that traveled to endemic areas, and the potential use of this agent as a biological weapon underscore the need to understand its viral pathogenesis as well as to develop intervention strategies [13, 14, 15, 16]. The unique characteristics of the marmoset make it especially suited for high biocontainment research. In particular, the small size of the animal as opposed to larger NHP species makes husbandry less cumbersome and time-consuming thus using these monkeys at high containment is safer and less expensive than using larger NHP counterparts. In addition, current small animal models for some hemorrhagic fever diseases require the use of rodent-adapted viruses, which have been shown not to be especially predictive of efficacy in NHPs. The marmoset has the advantage that it is susceptible to infection with wild-type viruses, which is desirable for testing vaccines and therapeutics.",

Following an incubation period of 7\u201318 days, the disease is marked by a gradual onset of symptoms including fever, weakness and malaise. As the disease progresses, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain are often observed.

Histological analysis of tissue from infected animals identified lesions comparable to those described in human cases of fatal Lassa fever, and included hepatic and adrenal necrosis, lymphoid depletion, and interstitial nephritis [7\u2022, 10].

Early clinical symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, nausea, and mild hemorrhaging (petechiae), usually in skin or mucosal tissues [27, 28]. The initial targets, such as macrophages, recruit additional sentinel cells, through the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, leading to disseminated viral infection.

EBOV Zaire, Sudan and Bundibugyo, as well as MARV, are responsible for sporadic, highly lethal outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever in both humans and apes in sub-Saharan Africa, with mortality rates sometimes approaching 90% [34]. Although the primary animal host for the filoviruses is still somewhat unclear, as with other tropical viral diseases, bats have been strongly implicated as a possible reservoir [35, 36]. However, the description of EBOV Reston in pigs in Asia [37] serves as a warning about the potential ease with which these viruses may arise and spread in diverse species and populations. No FDA-approved vaccines or specific treatments are currently available for filoviruses, although recent advances in vaccine development are promising.",

Marmosets do not develop a petechial rash when infected with either MARV or EBOV and in this respect appear to be more similar to the African green monkey model of filovirus infection [38, 46]. Further evidence that the marmoset mimics human disease is that microscopic examination of tissue from EBOV-infected animals showed widespread fibrin deposition that is a hallmark of coagulation abnormalities [40, 45, 48]. EBOV infection of the marmoset caused a severe disseminated viral infection characterized principally by microthrombosis in multiple organs (disseminated intravasculature coagulation). MARV-infected animals displayed moderate fibrin deposition in the spleen. These findings are similar to those seen in human infection and in the macaque [40, 43\u2022, 45, 48]. Interestingly, signs of coagulopathy characteristic of primate infections are observed variably in rodent models [38, 49, 50].",

Older people were more often associated with increased SARS pathogenicity and death resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome [59, 60]. Intratracheal inoculation of marmosets with cell culture supernatant containing SARS-CoV develops disease with features similar to human disease [11\u2022]. Mononuclear cell interstitial pneumonitis, accompanied by multinucleated syncytial cells, edema, and bronchiolitis, was observed in most SARS-infected animals while alveolar macrophages and type-1 pneumocytes appeared to be the site of viral antigen localization. Furthermore, pulmonary tissue extracts obtained at necropsy as well as tracheobronchial lymph node and myocardium had detectable levels of viral RNA. Hepatic inflammation was observed in most animals, predominantly as a multifocal lymphocytic hepatitis accompanied by necrosis of individual hepatocytes [11\u2022].

Marmosets, because they are NHPs, provide distinct advantages over rodent species including an immunological repertoire that more closely resembles humans.

The \u2018animal rule\u2019 will allow approval provided that satisfactory efficacy data are generated in two animal models. In the case of viral hemorrhagic fever, the marmoset offers advantages over rodent species as an alternative small animal model. With regard to filovirus research, in addition to needing rodent adapted virus, mouse and guinea pig filovirus models have not been good predictors of efficacy in higher species. The marmoset model provides the advantages of a small animal model in high containment coupled with the immunological repertoire of an NHP and susceptibility to wild type, non-adapted viruses. Undoubtedly, increased use of marmoset models will accelerate pre-clinical development of vaccines and therapeutics to high consequence pathogens.",
