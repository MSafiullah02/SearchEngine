Six distinct categories can be constructed, the first four being originally described by Gel and Coombs (Types I\u2013IV reactions) (Coombs and Gell, 1975), and the last two (Types V and VI) being added by the author. These six categories include:1.Type I diseases mediated by homocytotropic antibodies and typified by immediate-type hypersensitivity, i.e., allergies;2.Type II diseases mediated by auto- or allo-reactive antibodies;3.Type III diseases mediated by immune complex deposition and characterized by vasculitis;4.Type IV diseases mediated by cell-mediated immune reactions and manifested by plasmacytic/lymphocytic infiltrates;5.Type V diseases manifested by gammopathies; and6.Type VI diseases manifested by immunodeficiency and opportunistic-type infections.\n",

Type I (allergic) diseases are associated with the IgE system, which is one of the primary defenses against parasite attacks. Type II (auto- and allo-antibody reactions) involve the formation of antibodies that react against self-antigens. Type III reactions involve the deposition and clearance of immune complexes, which are essential features of normal immune responses. Type IV diseases involve cellular immunity, which is the most important immune defense against pathogens or pathogenic states involving cells. Type V diseases involve excessive production of immunoglobulins or parts of immunoglobulins, while Type VI diseases occur when something impedes normal immune defense mechanisms, either innate or adaptive.",

About 60% of dogs are now purebred, and purebreeding always involves inbreeding. Because of the great diversity of immune mechanisms, and hence the genetic complexity of its development and regulation, it is understandable how inbreeding can result in a spectrum of disorders ranging from dysregulation of the immune system and autoimmunity at one extreme to cancers at the other. Although it may be oversimplistic, the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is thought to be controlled by the interplay of environmental and heritable factors; the latter involving genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Campbell and Milner, 1993).",

Allergens can be parts of parasites, such as house dust mites or cockroaches. Conditions which allow an excessive build-up of these insects in the environment will also increase the exposure level to their allergens.

Genetically predisposed dogs developed higher levels of specific IgE when exposed to pollen extracts several days following canine distemper immunization (Frick and Brooks, 1983). Enhanced production of cytotropic antibodies to non-parasite antigens may also result from disuse of normal IgE mediated immunity. Heavily parasitized people may have less problems with nuisance type allergies (Buckley et al., 1985), indicating that an IgE immune system engaged in normal parasite defenses is less likely to react to peripheral or related antigens.",

This is easily done when drugs are the offenders, because alternative products are usually available that are not allergenic. However, vaccines, which are the most common cause of such reactions, are more problematic for veterinarians. Many veterinarians believe that booster vaccinations are absolutely essential and are unwilling to forego their use even when they have previously evoked an allergic reaction. If systemic allergic reactions to vaccination are life-threatening (i.e., anaphylactic shock), the risk of subsequent immunizations will far out-weigh the negligible benefits provided by booster vaccinations. The chances of an older and well-vaccinated dog getting potentially fatal infections like canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, parvovirus enteritis, leptospirosis or rabies are extremely low, and the other vaccinatable diseases, such as kennel cough, parinfluenza, Lyme borreliosis, and coronavirus enteritis are of limited clinical relevance in the general dog population. Even concern about the legal requirement for rabies boosters should not override common sense; a waiver can usually be obtained for rabies vaccinations when the use of such vaccine is life threatening. If systemic allergic reactions to vaccines are severe, but not life threatening (hives, angioneurotic edema), pretreat the animal 1 h before immunization with antihistamine and prednisolone. Give 1/10th the vaccine dose; if no adverse reaction is seen in 10\u201320 min, administer the remainder. Changing brands or types of vaccine will seldom prevent the problem, because most vaccines contain similar offending allergens. However, leptospirosis bacterin is the worst offender and the least essential vaccine, and can easily be left out of the vaccination regimen.",

The cough is easily elicited upon tracheal compression, and is often evoked by exercise, drinking of water, excitement, or pulling on the leash.

Following allergic stimulation of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa, the mucosal cells secrete a thick and tenacious type of mucus.

It has been said that autoantigens are not so abundant that they induce clonal deletion or anergy, but not so rare as to escape recognition entirely (Janeway and Travers, 1996). Corato et al. (1997)concluded that normal dogs had auto-erythrocyte reactive lymphocytes, but that these lymphocytes must be primed in individuals with AIHA or a heritable susceptibility to the disease. Therefore, the capacity to generate self-reactive immunity appears to be suppressed by the normal immune system. The T-cell system is particularly involved in down-regulating autoantibody production by B-cells, and when antibodies against a particular self-antigen are generated, some aspect of T-cell regulation must have failed. Normal T-cell regulatory function can be influenced by a number of conditions, including microbial (especially viral) infections, vaccines (McAnulty and Rudd, 1985), diseases of the lymphoreticular system such as lymphosarcoma, certain drugs, genetic weaknesses resulting in instabilities in self/non-self-recognition, and unrecognized factors.",

Indeed, many body proteins are antigenic but are not recognized as such because they are sequestered from the host's immune system (Streilein, 1993). There is also evidence that natural autoantibodies exist to deeply sequestered red cell membrane proteins (e.g., spectrin) in dogs (Barker and Elson, 1993; Barker et al., 1991), and that these antibodies may help in the destruction of aged and worn red cells. Thyroglobulin is immunogenic if it is injected into other areas of the body, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are often secondarily associated with primary destructive diseases of the thyroid gland in dog and humans. Following myocardial infarction or hepatic necrosis in humans, antibodies to cardiac muscle, microsomes, and other cellular constituents appear transiently in the serum. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) often appear in the serum of dogs with aural hematomas, and these antibodies probably result form the extravasation and destruction of blood cells (and thus release of sequestered nuclear antigens) into the ear tissues. In these examples, the autoantibodies may be markers of disease (as in hypothyroidism in dogs) and of no clinical significance. The autoantibodies cannot react with antigens that are sequestered deep within the cells. In other cases, however, autoantibodies that are generated in this manner may actually have a pathogenic effect. Brucella canis infection often localizes in the testicles of dogs and can induce an autoantibody reaction to sperm and infertility (George and Carmichael, 1984; Serikawa et al., 1984).",

This flamboyant leukocyte response is a `slop-over' from the intense erythropoiesis and may be mistaken for granulocytic leukemia in some cases. In order of prevalence, Coomb's reactivity is usually associated with IgG, IgG and IgM, or IgM autoantibodies (Day, 1996a, Day, 1996b, Day, 1996c); the Coomb's antibodies are warm-reactive in most cases. Cold agglutinins, when present, are of the IgM class and detectable at 4\u00b0C. Autoantibodies in dogs with subacute IHA have been associated with glycophorins similar to those found in the human rhesus complex, unknown surface peptides, and possibly to membrane associated phospholipid (Barker et al., 1991; Barker and Elson, 1995).",

The anemia develops over weeks or months and presenting clinical signs are lethargy, fatigue, and pallor. Unlike subacute IHA, the anemia is unresponsive, almost always Coomb's antibody negative, and systemic signs such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and icterus are not apparent. This form of IHA is probably associated with autoantibodies that react with surface antigens present on red cells that are late in differentiation, but not yet released into the circulation. This explains the absence of Coomb's antibody positivity and spherocytosis. An indirect Coomb's test is sometimes positive when the animal's red cells are treated with bromelin, ficin or trypsin and then incubated with its serum. Such treatment may expose more deeply situated antigens not present on circulating mature red cells but that were arrayed on the surface at an earlier stage of differentiation. As expected, the bone marrow shows either a hyper- or normal-responsive erythroid series. Multiple incompatibilities are sometimes seen on cross-match even though the animal may never have been transfused before. Chronic IHA has to be differentiated from congenital red blood cell enzyme deficiencies (heritable spherocytosis) associated with erythrocyte phosphofructokinase (American Cocker spaniel; English Springer spaniel) and erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (Basenji) deficiencies (Giger and Noble, 1991; Giger et al., 1992).",

The anemia is totally unresponsive, while WBC and platelet counts are normal. The Coomb's test is negative, spherocytes are absent, and like chronic AIHA, compatible donors are sometimes difficult to find. The reason for this higher than normal incidence of allo-reacting antibodies is unknown. The diagnostic tip-off is the existence of a marrow aplasia that involves only one cell-line.

Anemia, often responsive, accompanies cases that have either IHA or excessive blood loss. Platelets in the blood are often large and bizarre shaped. Megakaryocytes in bone marrow are normal in numbers or increased in 90% or more of cases. Although megakaryocytes may be present in normal or increased numbers, they often appear immature, fragmented, or fragile. Megakaryocytes are severely decreased or even absent in <10% of cases; such a finding is suggestive of a `pure megakaryocytic aplasia'. Clotting tests, including PT, PTT, ACT, and FDPs are normal. Anti-platelet antibodies, as determined by platelet factor-3 release test are present in 70% or less of the cases. A fluorescent antibody test for antiplatelet antibodies can be done on bone marrow smears, providing megakaryocytes are present; it is about 40% sensitive (Kristensen et al., 1994a, Kristensen et al., 1994b). An indirect platelet immunoflourescence test appears to have a higher sensitivity (70%) (Kristensen et al., 1994a, Kristensen et al., 1994b). Adaptation of the latter test to flow cytometry did not improve the sensitivity. Using sensitive binding tests, platelet bound antibodies were found in over 90% of affected dogs and serum anti-platelet antibodies in 34% (Lewis and Meyers, 1996; Lewis et al., 1995). Because of the relative insensitivities of anti-platelet antibody tests the diagnosis of ITP is usually made on clinical appearance and response to therapy. Care must be taken to rule out secondary causes of ITP or of thrombocytopenia.",

Like the human disease, affected dogs usually manifest because of the anemia, and thrombocytopenia is detected during the clinical work-up, or vice versa. Many dogs with Evan's syndrome will also be leukopenic, suggesting a broad-based attack on the bone marrow. The various cytopenias may occur simultaneously, manifest variably during the same attack, or appear to one degree or another upon subsequent attacks. Care must be taken not to diagnose Evan's syndrome in dogs with immune- or non-immune-mediated blood loss and consumptive thrombocytopenias. For example, many dogs with peracute IHA will have an associated DIC and consumptive thrombocytopenia. The same is true for dogs with severe babesiosis or haemobartonellosis. Dogs with Evan's syndrome are less likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy alone, and are more difficult to get into remission with combination immunosuppressive drug therapy, as is the case with the human disease (Matthew et al., 1997). Relapses may occur at varying times after cessation of treatment. Glucocorticoid and cyclosporine therapy is indicated in difficult-to-treat cases in humans (Emilia et al., 1996; Rackoff and Manno, 1994), and has proved useful in dogs. Leflunomide may prove to be of significant benefit to dogs with refractory disease (Gregory et al., 1998).",

The greatest risk is to DEA 1.1 and 1.2 negative dogs that have been previously transfused with blood from DEA 1.1 and 1.2 positive donors; these dogs will develop severe reactions to subsequent transfusions with DEA 1.1 and 1.2 positive blood. Sensitization need not involve previous transfusion; a surprising number of dogs with IHA, and no previous transfusion history, will also possess alloantibodies against a range of red cell surface antigens, and these alloantibodies can be clinically significant. The precise red cell antigens involved in such animals have yet to be determined.",

The indirect Coomb's test involves preincubating donor RBCs with recipient serum for an hour or so and washing and resuspending them in saline before adding the Coomb's reagent.

Complement is bound to the complexes, and this in turn can lead to the influx of polymorphonuclear cells and localized inflammation. This reaction is localized around blood vessels, hence vasculitis is one of the hallmarks of SLE. If the vascular reaction occurs in glomeruli, glomerulonephritis is the result. Vasculitis in synovial blood vessels results in synovitis; meningeal vessels-meningitis; retinal vessels-uveitis; serosal vessels-peritonitis or pleuritis; spinal cord vessels-transverse myelopathies; cardiac vessels-myocarditis; pericardial blood vessels-pancreatitis; GI tract-colic and ulcers, etc. Immune complexes in the skin are usually found around small dermal vessels and in the basal lamina. Deposition of immune complexes in the skin does not always cause lesions by itself, but is potentiated by exposure to solar radiation. Lesions on the extremities (face, hands, ears, bridge of nose, etc.) are therefore, the most striking.",

SLE is associated with a state of immunologic hyper responsiveness, mainly in the B-cell system. There is a deficiency of T-suppressor lymphocytes and an increase in antibody levels to many common antigens, especially of viral origin. Individuals with SLE also have a greater than normal propensity to make autoantibodies, especially to RBCs, platelets, and leukocyte antigens. Antibodies to coagulation proteins (circulating anticoagulants) develop in 10\u201315% of humans with SLE and have been reported in a dog (Stone et al., 1994). Anti-coagulants are against phospholipids and intrinsic clotting factors such as factor VIII. These antibodies can cause thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications in some people and dogs. Humans with SLE also frequently develop false positive serologic tests for syphilis. This is due to the development of cross-reacting antibodies to phospholipids that are present in many organs and on the syphilis spirochete. Some dogs with SLE will produce antibodies to heat shock proteins (Bell et al., 1995). About 30% of the humans with SLE develop rheumatoid factors, as do a similar proportion of dogs with SLE (Chabanne et al., 1993). Rheumatoid factors are antibodies (IgM) that react with immune complexed or denatured IgG. Lymphocytotoxic antibodies are also detected in the serum of some human and canine patients.",

The disease occurs most commonly in purebreds with long nose confirmation, but especially in Collies and Shetland sheepdogs. The disease is considered to be a focal form of SLE, with deposition of immune complexes in the basement membrane. Nuclear antigens have been extracted from the lesions of at least one dog with discoid lupus, suggesting that they help make up the immune complexes (White et al., 1992). Disease of the basement membrane renders the skin more susceptible to the effects of solar radiation, which are focused most intensely on the nasal planum and on to the nose. The result is a low grade inflammation of the nasal planum with depigmentation. Constant licking of the lesions can lead to additional damage to the nose. Increased numbers of epidermal langerhan cells expressing MHC class II have been seen in dogs with discoid lupus, but not with pemphigus foliaceous (Day, 1996a, Day, 1996b, Day, 1996c). Antinuclear antibodies are usually not found in the circulation, but have been observed on occasion (Iwasaki et al., 1995b).

A non-erosive polyarthritis has been observed in subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) in man and dogs, and indeed the entire syndrome of SBE can mimic SLE. Two dogs described by Bennett (1986)best document this point. Chronic bacterial endocarditis can lead to continuous low-grade damage to parenchymal organs, high levels of circulating immune complexes, and a heightened responsiveness of the hosts immune system. In man and animals this may result in the production of numerous autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factors. Antinuclear antibodies result from chronic nucleoprotein release and heightened immunologic responsiveness, and rheumatoid factors are made in response to persistent immune-complex production. This phenomenon is important, because if such animals are mistakenly diagnosed as having SLE or rheumatoid arthritis, they will be treated with immunosuppressive drugs, with potentially serious consequences.",

In favor of the latter etiology, CCL reconstruction is often curative by itself in these dogs. Significantly increased levels of serum anti-native collagen type II antibody, as assessed by ELISA, have also been measured in dogs with diverse joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, infective arthritis, primary DJD and CCL rupture (Bari et al., 1989). In favor of the cruciate disease being secondary to some immune disorder:1.proper immunosuppressive drug therapy early in the course of the disease often renders affected animals sound;2.the subset of dogs with this form of CCL rupture are different from the older, sedentary, overweight spayed female dogs that develop classical ligament degeneration;3.breeds of dogs that suffer from this disorder tend to be the same breeds that are afflicted by other immunologic diseases; and4.inflammation can sometimes be detected in joints other than the affected stifles.\nRegardless of the ultimate cause, it would be prudent to treat atypical cases of CCL rupture with inflammatory synovial fluids medically as early in the disease course as possible, and to augment or substitute medical treatment with surgery in more advanced cases or in animals that fail to respond medically. Medical treatment would be the same as for other immunologic arthritides.",

Joint fluids contain large numbers of non-degenerative neutrophils. The first sign of the allergic reaction tends to occur from 10 to 21 days after drug treatment is initiated for some other condition. This is the time period during which sensitization occurs. Alternatively, drug reactions may occur within hours of administering a drug that had been used safely in the past. Affected dogs become acutely febrile, stiff and sore, and develop a generalized rash. The rash can take several forms, but individual lesions on the skin are clearly of a vascular origin with hemorrhagic blistering, focal necrosis with hemorrhage, severe focal petechiation, etc. Additional features may include lymphadenopathy, polymyositis, anemia, glomerulonephritis, focal retinitis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is readily apparent, providing the clinician is astute enough to connect drug treatment with the onset of an acute vasculitis syndrome involving primarily skin and joints. This linkage may be missed, especially if it is assumed that the condition at hand is merely an extension of the condition for which the treatment was prescribed. There is a rapid resolution of signs upon discontinuation of drug treatment, although whirlpool baths and glucocorticoids may be required to speed the healing of the skin lesions.",

(1997)described 49 cases of a rapidly progressive and highly fatal glomerulonephritis in dogs; affected animals were younger (5.6 \u00b1 2.6 years) than other dogs with idiopathic glomerulonephritis (7.1 \u00b1 3.6 years) and Labrador and Golden retrievers were five times or more over represented. The glomerular disease was mainly membranoproliferative and was associated with subendothelial IgG, IgM and C3 deposition. Although this disease has been linked to Lyme borreliosis exposure and vaccination, silver stains failed to show a strong relationship between spirochetes in the kidneys and lesions development.",

Glomerular changes can be classified in most cases by conventional light microscopy and the pattern of immune complex deposition determined by immunofluorescene or immunoperoxidase staining. All of the WHO human categories of glomerular disease have been observed in dogs, i.e., focal, diffuse mesangial proliferative, diffuse endocapillary proliferative, mesangiocapillary, diffuse crescentic, diffuse sclerosing, amyloid, and unclassifiable (Macdougall et al., 1986). Immune complexes consist of IgG, IgM (Minkus et al., 1994), IgA (Harris et al., 1993; Miyauchi et al., 1992), or combinations of the three, and complement. IgG and C3 are more apt to be associated with dense deposits, while IgA and IgM are observed in animals with dense or minimal deposits (Koeman et al., 1987). Membranous and mesangial proliferative changes vary in severity, and in exceptional cases, lesions are unapparent upon light microscopic examination and may even be minimal when viewed by electron microscopy (Vilafranca et al., 1993). These latter dogs have a condition analogous to `minimal change disease' of humans.",

There is some debate on whether dogs with GN should be treated conservatively with low protein diet and blood pressure control (Lulich et al., 1996), or vigorously with the addition of immunosuppressive drugs. Conservative therapy is often favored because of the relatively high incidence (about 20%) of spontaneous remission (Biewenga and Gruys, 1986), and to the poor response and side-effects of prolonged immunosuppressive drug therapy. Cyclosporine treatment was found to offer no improvement over non-treated animals in treatment of glomerulonephritis and was associated with a number of side-effects (Vaden et al., 1995). There is no question that some dogs, especially younger animals with minimal glomerular changes and acute onset nephrotic syndrome, will self-cure after several months of conservative treatment (diet change with or without glucocorticoids). However, the disease in other dogs will not self-cure and vigorous treatment will slow the course of renal disease. Glucocorticoids alone are usually not effective, and combination therapy with glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine is required. Unfortunately, most dogs with glomerulonephritis present late in their disease course when treatment is minimally effective. The mean survival of one large group of dogs with glomerular disease (glomerulonephritis and renal amyloidosis) was 28 days (Cook and Cowgill, 1996).",

Because a single NK cell can recognize a wide spectrum of abnormal cells, NK cell immunity is not antigen specific. Therefore, NK cell activity is considered to be an integral part of innate, rather than adaptive, immunity. Most in vitro assay procedures for NK cell activity involve killing of tumor cell targets. NK cells recognize foreign or altered cells during their wanderings through the body; the same cell being capable of recognizing a wide range of abnormal cells. NK cells touch membranes of abnormal cells and kill them by releasing specific lymphokines. NK cell-mediated killing can be enhanced by antibodies specific for abnormal surface antigens on malignant or antigenically altered cells, a process known as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This is an example of how a more primitive form of immunity can be upgraded by the subsequent evolution of antigen specific humoral immunity. T-cells, which evolved for cell-mediated immunity, were also used later for control and regulation of B-cell immunity.",

Other cytokines induce a clonal expansion of a subpopulation of T-cells that bear the identical antigen receptor. Some of these proliferating T-cells become antigen-specific effector or killer cells. T-effector cells can recognize and kill the abnormal cells by bringing themselves into intimate contact and releasing cytotoxic lymphokines. Because macrophages are a favorite reservoir for microbial growth or ingest organisms as part of their phagocytic function, they are an important target for T-cell responses. T-effector cells can either kill infected macrophages directly, activate surrounding macrophages to assist in direct cell killing, or `instruct' the macrophage to activate itself and to destroy any microbes that it might contain.

Cartilage is undermined by subchondral inflammation and overlain by a pannus of granulation tissue emanating from points of synovial attachment. The net effect is a progressive destruction of cartilage starting at the joint margins; this ultimately leads to joint instability, subluxation, and luxation. The synovial membrane undergoes a characteristic villus hyperplasia with dense infiltrates of plasma cells and lymphocytes. Lymphocytes in the infiltrate, in the human disease, result from an almost clonal expansion of selected CD4+ T-cells which are autoreactive and lack functionally important CD28 surface markers (Martens et al., 1997). However, the role of these cells in the pathogenesis or etiology of human RA is unknown (Breedveld, 1998).

They are detectable, therefore, in many diseases where chronic immune complexing is occurring. Although of definite value in the diagnosis of human rheumatoid arthritis, the value of rheumatoid factor tests in canine rheumatoid arthritis is less certain. Some veterinary researchers have been able to detect rheumatoid factors in a majority of affected dogs, but in only a small proportion of normal dogs and animals with other conditions (Halliwell et al., 1989; Bennett and Kirkham, 1987). In one study, however, rheumatoid factors were detected at comparatively low titer and in only about one quarter of the cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis (Pedersen et al., 1976b). Recent studies have also confirmed that rheumatoid factors are present at only low titer and in only about one-fourth of dogs with rheumatoid arthritis; they are also present at similar titer and incidence in unclassified polyarthritis, heartworm disease, pyometra, leishmaniasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Chabanne et al., 1993; Nielsen, 1992). Antinuclear antibodies are sometimes detected in dogs with rheumatoid arthritis, but not as frequently as in SLE.",

The synovial membrane is edematous and hyperemic in the early course of the disease, and may be covered with a fine layer of fibrin. The synovial fluid is cloudy and yellowish, and often contains fibrin tags. In later stages, a lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrate is seen in the synovial lining. Peripheral lymph nodes are enlarged and hyperactive. Pannus formation and marginal subchondral erosions are seen to a limited extent. Destruction of articular cartilage occurs in some joints but often is not associated with pannus formation.

Thyroid atrophy may not be a separate entity, but rather an end stage of the thyroiditis; 8/8 hypothyroid dogs in one study had lymphocytic thyroiditis on biopsy (Nachreiner et al., 1998). Thyroiditis was also shown to progress to severe atrophy in a study of hypothyroid Beagles (Benjamin et al., 1996). As in humans, hypothyroidism underlies a significant proportion of other immune disorders in dogs, and is seen overwhelmingly in purebreds.

Neurologic disorders (Jaggy et al., 1994a, Jaggy et al., 1994b; Jaggy and Oliver, 1994) and reproductive failure (Johnson, 1994) have also been associated with hypothyroidism in dogs. The diagnosis of thyroiditis and hypothyroidism should take into account clinical signs, breed predisposition, and evidence of decreased levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), increased levels of TSH, and the presence of antibodies to T3, T4 and thyoglobulin. Some clinical researchers feel that post-TSH stimulation levels of T4 are the single most diagnostic test (Jaggy and Oliver, 1994). The presence of autoantibodies to T3 and T4 cause serum T3 and T4 concentrations to appear falsely high; however, free T4 is non-detectable when measured with a dialysis assay (Kemppainen et al., 1996). Comparative studies of several tests demonstrated that both serum free T4 and TSH concentrations should be used in reaching a diagnosis; although free T4 tests were highly sensitive, greater specificity was obtained by combining the two assays (Peterson et al., 1997). The TSH test, although very specific, lacks sensitivity; about one-fourth of hypothyroid dogs will have values in the normal reference range. Antibody assays for thyroglobulin have also been found to be very sensitive and specific in diagnosing dogs with lymphocytic thyroiditis, when compared to antibody tests for T3 and/or T4 (Nachreiner et al., 1998).",

The perianal abnormalities have been associated with histological evidence of colitis as well (Harkin et al., 1996). Perianal lesions vary greatly, even in the same dog, in degrees of fibrosis, severity of inflammatory response and depth of sinus tracts (Killingsworth et al., 1988). Lesions tend to be in the zona cutanea, and hidradenitis with formation of epithelial-lined sinus tracts is apparent in over one-half of the biopsies examined. In another study dealing with anatomic predisposition, the only predisposing cause between German shepherds and other non-affected breeds was in the greater number of apocrine sweat glands in the zona cuneata (Budsberg et al., 1985). Secondary bacterial infection, with a number of different bacteria, is inevitably present (Killingsworth et al., 1988).",

The underlying immunologic basis appears to be a cell-mediated immune attack against melanotic tissues (Nakamura et al., 1996; Norose and Yano, 1996; Okada et al., 1996; Rao, 1997), possibly through reaction to the MART-1/Melan-A (Sugita et al., 1996). A VKH-like syndrome has been described in Akita dogs (Reusch et al., 1994a, Reusch et al., 1994b; Teifke et al., 1998) and in Huskies, Malamutes, Samoyeds and Chows. Although the lesions of the canine disease bear a superficial resemblance to VKH of people, it remains to be proven that the syndrome in dogs is the same. The eyes are much less likely to be involved in dogs than the skin, while the opposite is true in man. CNS signs are also not seen in dogs with VKH-like disease, but this may be due to the absence of melanocytes in the meninges of dogs compared to people. To further confuse the issue, many of these same breeds may have skin disease that superficially resembles VKH, but on closer examination and testing, the lesions are actually caused by pemphigus foliaceous. Human VKH can be strongly linked to certain HLA-types (-DR1 and -DR4); the exact predisposing HLA types differing somewhat according to the race under study (Arellanes-Garcia et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 1998; Islam et al., 1994; Shindo et al., 1994; Weisz et al., 1995).

It is not surprising that CDV and human measles virus are closely related members of the genus Morbillavirus. The lesions of old dog encephalitis are more glial proliferative, diffuse, and spare the cerebellum, while lesions of classic CDV encephalomyelitis tend to be focal, necrotizing, and more concentrated in the cerebellum, brain stem and spine (Vandevelde et al., 1980).",

Dogs with delayed-onset CDV encephalitis, unlike animals with acute demyelinating CDV encephalomyelitis, have high levels of CDV antibodies in their cerebral spinal fluid, indicating an active local immune response (Johnson et al., 1988). These antibodies have been shown to be directed solely to the M protein of CDV in 2/5 cases, which is the pattern observed in the homologous measles virus-induced SPE of humans; the remaining dogs demonstrated antibodies to nucleocapsid and phosoprotein antigens as well (Rima et al., 1987).",

Chronic active hepatitis occurs most commonly in Doberman pinschers and is characterized by inflammation and scar tissue formation around branches of small hepatic veins and apoptosis of hepatocytes in zone 3 (Thornburg, 1998). The inflammatory reaction consists predominantly of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, indicating a type IV immune reaction. The exact etiology of this condition is unknown, but the strong breed predisposition tends to support autoimmunity. However, autoimmunity was suspected to be the cause of virtually all chronic active hepatitis in people before hepatitis B, C, D and G virus infections and a number of therapeutic drugs were a demonstrated as causal agents (Desmet, 1997).",

The cilia of the mucous membranes, especially those of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts, act as brooms to trap and sweep out foreign material.

Certain breeds of dogs flattened faces and protruding eyes may have problems with tear drainage, causing excessive wetness around the eyes and bacterial overgrowth. A similar situation occurs in animals with congenital blockage of the lacrimal ducts.

Dogs that have hair growing down their ear canals are even more prone to infection than dogs that do not. Substances secreted onto the skin and mucous membranes by the various glands have an important non-specific microbial function.

The most common heritable deficiency of this type in man and animals involves IgA. About 1 : 500 people lack IgA. Absolute deficiencies of IgA are common in Chinese Shar peis, while partial deficiencies are common in German shepherd dogs (Day and Penhale, 1988a). The disorder has also been observed in other breeds, such as the Beagle. IgA deficiencies are manifested by increased incidence of skin and respiratory infections (Felsburg et al., 1985). Individuals with IgA deficiencies often have more problems with allergies, probably because the IgE system is called upon to compensate for the lack of IgA-mediated immunity. Several bloodlines in a colony of English cocker spaniels were reported to have relative IgA deficiency, a high incidence of ANA, Coomb's antibodies, SLE, hypothyroidism and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (Day, 1996a, Day, 1996b, Day, 1996c). Attempts to link aspergillosis in German shepherd dogs to their variable IgA deficiency have been negative (Day and Penhale, 1988a).",

The classical form of this SCIDs is the `boy in the glass bubble', associated with adenine deaminase deficiency. A similar disease, but with a different genetic basis, occurs in Basset hounds. Affected Bassett hounds often develop canine distemper at 10\u201316 weeks of age, when their maternal immunity wane. The source of the distemper virus is from their live virus vaccines. Animals that do not develop distemper, will usually fail to thrive and die by 5\u20136 months of age. SCID, associated with a X-linked defect in interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor function, was described in a family of Cardigan Welsch corgis (Deschenes et al., 1994; Jezyk et al., 1989; Pullen et al., 1997). The defect is caused by a single nucleotide insertion in the \u03b3 chain of the canine IL-2 receptor (Somberg et al., 1995). The same defect has been observed in a subset of people with SCIDS (Henthorn et al., 1994). Clinical features include failure to thrive, hypogammaglobulinemia, absent T-cell mitogen responses, and thymic dysplasia and lymphoid hypoplasia (Snyder et al., 1993; Somberg et al., 1996). Dogs raised in conventional environments usually die of environmental or vaccine-virus associated infections by five months of age. Dogs with the defect can be maintained indefinitely in gnotobiotic environments, although the incidence of leukemias may be increased (Felsburg et al., 1994).",

A certain subset of young (Medleau and Willemse, 1995), and occasionally aged (Duclos et al., 1994), dogs appear to be more susceptible to systemic demodectic mange. Great Danes and Doberman pinchers are more susceptible to cryptococcal infections than other breeds (Malik et al., 1995). Labrador and Golden retrievers are 5\u20136 times more susceptible to a type of glomerulonephritis that has been putatively associated with Borrelia burgdorferi infection (Dambach et al., 1997). Neospora caninum infection, in both neonatal and adult forms, is almost always observed in purebred dogs (Barber and Trees, 1996; Cuddon et al., 1992; Flagstad et al., 1995; Jacobson and Jardine, 1993; Poli et al., 1998; Pumarola et al., 1996). Dogs with selective immunodeficiencies have normal immune responses to other infectious agents, normal complement and Ig levels, and will even respond favorably if treated properly for the problem infection (Day et al., 1985).",

            "text": "An intriguing syndrome manifested by acute fever, gastrointestinal signs, and malaise has been observed in Weimeraner puppies (Couto et al., 1989). These initial signs, which vary in severity, are often followed by mild to severe hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD) (Woodard, 1982). In some animals, recurrent disease signs involving the alimentary tract, joints, skin, peripheral lymph nodes, central nervous system and conjunctiva persist through adolescence (Day et al., 1997). The condition has been reportedly associated with variable decreases in one or more immunoglobulin isotopes (Couto et al., 1989; Day et al., 1997) and possible neutrophil functional abnormalities (Couto et al., 1989; Hansen et al., 1995). Although most breeders feel that the condition is triggered by vaccination (Dodds, 1999), some puppies have developed the condition even when not vaccinated. The condition appears to fall in the category of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) of humans. CVID is a heterogenous syndrome (Spickett et al., 1997), characterized by humoral immunodeficiency involving one or more immunoglobulin isotypes, recurrent bacterial infections and a variety of other immunologic abnormalities (Eibl and Wolf, 1995; Eisenstein and Sneller, 1994). Affected humans show various defects in T-cell regulation of B-cells, B-cell activation, or of cytokine responses. However, there are notable differences in the Weimaraner syndrome from CVID in people:1.The disease occurs solely in puppies, whereas CVID can be seen in infants, children and adults;2.CVID is rarely self-limiting, whereas many affected dogs appear to outgrow the condition; and3.affected dogs respond dramatically to steroid therapy, while humans are treated with \u03b3 globulin to compensate for the antibody deficiencies.\nIf inappropriately treated, many affected Weimaraner puppies will die or be euthanitized. Glucocorticoid treatment is highly effective in breaking the febrile response, resolving systemic signs, and hastening the resolution of the HOD. Unfortunately, many veterinarians will not use this treatment, because they mistakenly view the condition purely as an immunodeficiency.",

In contract, congenital phagocyte anomalies are usually associated with a decrease in the function of the phagocytes. In either case, the net effect is a diminished phagocytic capacity.

Anticancer drug therapy often leads to profound cytopenias during the induction stages of treatment, putting them at grave risk for infection. Autoimmune and drug induced neutropenias of immune origin are often manifested by fevers and sepsis. Ninety percent of dogs necropsied for acute parvovirus infection had recoverable E. coli in their lungs and liver (Turk et al., 1990); secondary infections with Candida albicans (Rodraiguez et al., 1998), Clostridium perfringens (Turk et al., 1992), Edwardsiella tarda (Van Assche, 1991) have also been described. These secondary infections occur because of both profound neutropenia and the effacement of the intestinal barrier. Anti-neoplastic drug therapy, aplastic anemias, and myeloid tumors may all be associated with severe neutropenias and secondary infections in dogs. Diabetes mellitus in humans and dogs is associated with defects in neutrophil function, and diabetic dogs have a greatly increased incidence of bacterial cystitis (Kirsch, 1998).

The antigens on dog cells that define allogeneic differences are found on many cell types. In grafts, alloantigens are rich in passenger host lymphocytes and on graft endothelium. Leukocytes, being particularly rich in histocompatibility antigens and easy to collect from the blood, were the tissue of choice for early researchers. These early researchers used alloantibodies and mixed-lymphocyte reactions to define histocompatibility differences between individuals. Antigens that define histocompatibility differences are coded for by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and are called dog leukocyte (DL) antigens. The genes of the MHC are found on a single chromosome. The first group of DL antigens that have been defined are called A, hence the term DLA antigens. Current designations of genes and alleles of the MHC in the dog are increasingly derived from actual DNA sequence.",

It usually occurs over a period of 7\u201314 days when histocompatibility differences are great, or it can take several weeks when histocompatibility differences are weak. It begins as soon as the graft is vascularized in the donor. Donor lymphocytes (present in the graft at time of donation) and the graft endothelium express significant surface concentrations of histocompatibility antigens. Donor or passenger lymphocytes contain the highest level of alloantigens on their surfaces, while normal resting donor endothelium has a much lower amount. Recipient T-lymphocytes surveying the tissues rapidly detect these differences and bind to the surfaces of these cell types. What follows is essentially a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction targeted against donor lymphocytes (passenger lymphocytes) and the graft endothelium. The latter tissue is the essential target of the response, although passenger lymphocytes may play an important primary sensitizing role. Activated lymphocytes specific for the alloantigens of the graft began to bind in low numbers to the graft endothelium and release their cytokines. One effect of the cytokines is to cause the graft endothelium to become activated, which upregulates the surface expression of the alloantigens. This increase in surface alloantigen expression makes the graft endothelium much more vulnerable to attack by immune lymphocytes. As more and more activated T-cells bind to the endothelium, the mass of cytokine release causes eventual death of the endothelium. With the death of the endothelium, thrombosis occurs and the graft dies.",

Alkylating agents act against many arms of the immune response. They inhibit normal primary and secondary responses as well as delayed hypersensitivity reactions. They prolong the survival of organ grafts, decrease the production of interferon, diminish antigen trapping in lymph nodes, and inhibit local inflammatory responses. Alkylating agents act on lymphoid cells by killing slowly proliferating antigen reactive cells as well as rapidly proliferating specifically stimulated cells.

In these diseases of humans, chlorambucil has been shown to be much more effective than cyclophosphamide and has fewer side effects. The impression in animals has been that it is less effective than cyclophosphamide as an immunosuppressive agent, but that the decrease in efficacy is compensated for by its lesser toxicity. This drug will probably see increasing usage in veterinary medicine for the treatment of immunologic diseases as clinicians learn to use it to treat more conditions. Chlorambucil is given at a dosage of about 1 mg/15 kg (0.07 mg/kg) PO, once daily, for animals in the 15- to 30-kg weight range. Smaller dogs should receive about 0.08 mg/kg and larger dogs about 0.06 mg/kg PO once daily. After remission is achieved, the drug should be administered at the previously mentioned dosage once every other day.",

A sterile hemorrhagic cystitis is a common side effect of chronic cyclophosphamide therapy. For this reason, cyclophosphamide should not be used for periods longer than three to four months. If cytotoxic drug therapy is required after this period of time, chlorambucil or azathioprine should be substituted for cyclophosphamide. Neither of these drugs induces sterile hemorrhagic cystitis.

For optimum effect, they must be given during the stage of immune response in which cells are rapidly dividing. The thiopurines have been useful in preventing allograft rejection and have a particularly strong inhibitory effect on the expression of delayed hypersensitivity. They also have a potent inhibitory effect on the non-specific inflammatory response, which may be due in part to inhibition of the influx of mononuclear cells into the site.

It has made it possible to transplant dogs, which are notorious for the violence of their rejection responses, even with prednisone and cyclosporine A treatment (Lirtzman et al., 1996). Leflunomide has also shown great promise in the treatment of immune diseases in dogs (Gregory et al., 1998). One of the metabolites of Leflunomide, trifluromethylaniline (TFMA), is highly gastroenterotoxic for dogs. Therefore, the dose and dosage regimen must be closely followed. The drug is teratogenic in rats, so long-term use may lead to an increase in certain neoplasms. The dose for dogs is \u22482\u20136 mg/kg/day per os until a serum trough level of 30 ug/ml is achieved.",

Danazol is thought to work by decreasing the density of Fc receptors on macrophages. Fc receptors bind the Fc portion of platelet bound immunoglobulin and facilitate the macrophage-mediated destruction of the antibody coated platelets. About 20% of the human cases of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia refractory to standard therapy will respond to Danazol within 4\u20138 weeks, and it has been advocated for use in dogs for this purpose (Miller, 1997). It has also been used to treat a dog with an Evan's-like syndrome (Holloway et al., 1990).",

Human immune globulin was also given to 13 of 37 dogs with IHA that had failed to respond to glucocorticoids after seven days; the addition of the globulin appeared beneficial in 10/13 of these animals (Kellerman and Bruyette, 1997).

Its use should be limited to the following situations: (1) when a satisfactory remission cannot be obtained with single or combination drug therapy alone; (2) when an animal is showing toxicity to the chronic drug therapy needed to maintain remission and either the drugs need to be eliminated altogether or their dosage needs to be decreased. Mixed results have been described for splenectomy in dogs. In one study of IHA, ITP and Evan's syndrome, splenectomy was found to reduce, but not eliminate, the need for immunosuppressive drugs in 8/9 dogs (Feldman et al., 1985). In another study of dogs with ITP, 4/5 dogs with relapsing and hard to medically control disease were able to go off of all drugs after splenectomy (Jans et al., 1990).",
