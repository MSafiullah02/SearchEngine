As a result, we opted to adapt our PPE to include hospital scrubs, 1-piece Tyvek suits with hoods, and half facepiece reusable silicone respirators with extended life particulate filters for enhanced durability and increased comfort.

Careful escalation of oxygen therapy and a lower threshold to intubate these patients were thought to mitigate the risks associated with managing a deteriorating patient in an uncontrolled scenario.6 The use of continuous positive airway pressure was limited, and the use of bag valve mask ventilation was adapted to include a filter and a 2-person technique. Additionally, the regular use of COVID-19\u2013specific rapid sequence induction7 (Appendix 1) and influenzalike illness (ILI) patient transfer checklists is also recommended and was implemented by the BCEHS CCT program on March 12, 2020.",
