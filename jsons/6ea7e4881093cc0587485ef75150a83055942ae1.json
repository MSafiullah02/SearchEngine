Finally, we consider the potential future variations of three practical factors, namely, the contact rate (during Chunyun return journey), the recovery rate (due to emergence of vaccine or mutation of the virus), and the quarantine rate (associated with dynamics between hospital resource and spread of infection), and analyze how these factors influence the future trends of the epidemic.
