However, the RT-PCR test for throat swab samples has limitations such as sample collection and transportation, as well as suboptimal performance.

The infection managers are mainly responsible for training all the personnel in the department. Before working, all the personnel were trained with regards to infection knowledge, including on-site training and guidance, using demonstration pictures, recorded videos, etc. The aim was to ensure that the entire radiology team had accurate knowledge of infection, ultimately ensuring that the personnel had the least risk of infection.",

The radiologic technologist first puts on the 1st surgical cap, then the respirator, then the 2nd surgical cap, then isolation gowns, then the 1st surgical gloves, the 1st shoe covers, the protective glass, the disposable gowns, the 2nd surgical gloves, then 2nd shoe covers, then the surgical mask, and at last they must check for tightness of the outfit. This sequence takes about 30 min. Subsequently, the medical personnel pass through the two buffer rooms, the potentially contaminated area, and then enters the contaminated area to work. This is the detailed information of putting on personal protective equipment. Next, we introduce the procedure of how to remove the personal protective equipment. According to the flowchart of taking off protective equipment, the radiologic technologist takes off different protective equipment in different areas after finishing making CT scans, as shown in Fig. 3 .",

Hand hygiene must be performed before each step and the personal protective equipment should be placed in a dedicated yellow medical trash can. After this, the medical personnel enter the second buffer room, and in this buffer room they should take off inner shoe covers, isolation gown, inner gloves, and outer cap. Again, the radiologic technologist must perform hand hygiene before each step. And then they enter the first buffer room, take off respirator, the inner cap and finally put on a surgical mask. Hand hygiene should be strictly followed before each step. It is worth noting that the radiologic technologist cannot touch the front of the respirator when removing it. Finally, they perform personal cleaning in the clean area, using 75 % alcohol to disinfect the external auditory canal, using iodine to disinfect the nasal cavity, using normal saline to disinfect the mouth, and then take a thorough bath for less than 30 min after back to apartment. The above is the sequence of putting on and removing protective material when the radiologic technologist makes CT scanning. When he/she makes mobile DR, the steps are basically similar. The difference is that the operators should add face shield and isolation gowns on the basis of BSL-2 in the clean area. And after taking DR photos the operators remove face shield and outer isolation gowns in the contaminated area and remove different protective equipment in different areas. The remaining steps are consistent with the above description.",

It can help detect subtle lesions, and assess the severity of the disease. Above all, chest CT is the main imaging method for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19.

It is necessary for the radiologic technologists to wear BSL-3 protective equipment before entering the ward. Subsequently, the mobile DR is pushed to a fixed position to connect to the network. After the patient information is stored in mobile DR, the technologist makes an X-ray of the patient's chest. It is worth noting that the flat detector of the mobile DR is wrapped with disposable sheets to avoid cross-infection. During shooting, the technologists may minimize close contact with patients. After taking the X-ray, the disposable sheets are placed in a special trash bin place and the flat detector is disinfected with 75 % ethanol solution after every X-ray. The technologists don't change (part of their) protective gear when moving from one patient to the next. But they must perform hand hygiene.

The contaminated area, potentially contaminated area, buffer rooms and clean area are all equipped with UV lamps; the air is disinfected by the UV lamps for about 60 min at least 2-3 times daily.
