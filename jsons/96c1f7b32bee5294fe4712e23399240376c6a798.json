First of all, early diagnosis of the agent is extremely important to rapidly identify the viral threat and to start the intervention as soon as possible (Memish et al. 2014) . To this end, a syndromic approach and the use of an appropriate case-definition may be useful to hypothesize the nature of the disease. However, as demonstrated with Ebola in the large outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014, only a small proportion of cases had hemorrhagic manifestations, thus relying on bleeding did not provide a valid clue to diagnosis. Laboratory diagnosis is more specific and represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of an emergent virus. However, in certain contexts, it may be difficult to perform relatively sophisticated tests under adverse environmental conditions. Moreover, the lack of protective equipment and high security level laboratories is an obstacle to handling potentially infected samples. To overcome this problem, mobile BSL4 labs have been extensively provided by the international community to allow Ebola virus infection diagnosis during the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.",
