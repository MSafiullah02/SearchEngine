Nasal swabs were collected from 114 cattle on initial BRD treatment. Processing included modified live virus (MLV) vaccination. Seven BRD necropsy cases were included for 121 total cases. Mean number of days on feed before first sample was 14.9 days. Swabs and tissue homogenates were tested by gel based PCR (G-PCR), quantitative-PCR (qPCR) and quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and viral culture. There were 87/114 (76.3%) swabs positive for at least one virus by at least one test. All necropsy cases were positive for at least one virus. Of 121 cases, positives included 18/121 (14.9%) BoHV-1; 19/121 (15.7%) BVDV; 76/121 (62.8%) BoCV; 11/121 (9.1%) BRSV; and 10/121 (8.3%) PI3V.

For many years \"traditional tests\", culture assays were used to identify viruses, however \"modern tests\", molecular tests have become commonplace. Historically, the mainstay for virology workups on BRD cases was a combination of immunofluorescence and attempted viral isolation. In the past two decades, molecular assays have increasingly supplanted classical methods. Strengths and weaknesses of traditional and molecular tests and interpretation were reported [13] . Issues facing clinicians includes interpretation of positive tests from animals with BRD signs with prior MLV vaccination. Discretion should be exercised in the interpretation of laboratory tests of recently MLV vaccinated cattle with BRD. Does the identified virus or positive nucleic acid represent virulent field infections or MLV strains? Study purposes were three fold: (1) testing nasal swabs from cattle treated for BRD and receiving MLV vaccines and necropsy tissues with varied tests including culture and molecular tests, (2) testing of culture positives determining specific type, subgenotype, or clade by viral sequencing; and (3) determining if specific viruses were field or MLV strain.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 96, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 97, "end": 99, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 546, "end": 549, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 550, "end": 553, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 554, "end": 557, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 558, "end": 561, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 562, "end": 566, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 709, "end": 712, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 713, "end": 717, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 718, "end": 722, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 723, "end": 727, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1196, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1731, "end": 1734, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Groups included samples submitted in the fall of 2015 and represented samples collected over a period of time and then delivered for testing.

There were numerous cases where samples were positive for only one or two tests and negative for the other(s). Potential factors for the differences of identification include: PCR tests detect both viral nucleic acids and infectious virus while viral culture requires more infectious virus than PCR [32] . Additional factors might include individual laboratory testing and interpretation of test results. In this study, three different laboratories performed these three tests. This study used samples from clinically ill cattle submitted for testing. Viruses were identified in nasals swabs (114) from cattle pulled for BRD treatments in feedlots. Viruses were found frequently, 87/114 (76.3%) in the initial phases of BRD in the entering cattle, even after MLV vaccinations. Potentially those cattle may have been infected prior to entry or after arrival. Regardless, clinicians and managements submitting samples to diagnostic laboratories and receiving results must interpret these results and determine if management measures are efficacious or modified. The question of whether clinically normal cohort animals were shedding viruses is valid, but was not addressed as the current study dealt with only clinically ill cattle. Recovery rate for each virus from nasal swabs indicates five BRD viruses are common in the initial stages of BRD in feedlots: 14/114 (12.3%) positive for BoHV-1, 14/114 (12.3%) for BVDV, 74/114 (64.9%) for BoCV, 10/114 (8.8%) for BRSV, and 8/114 (7.0%) for PI3V.

The multiplex PCR tests offer considerable opportunity for virus identification. These molecular tests detect both infectious virus and viral nucleic acids. Realistically, positive test results give an indication of the presence of the virus, especially on a herd basis. However, there are shortcomings of tests that do not separate vaccine from field strains such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescent antibody on necropsy tissues and the molecular and even viral culture positives, the reports only indicate the etiological agent without a distinction of field or vaccine strain designation. A recent publication on the traditional and contemporary tests for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) stated that addition to PCR testing, it is important to perform virus isolation during outbreaks of disease and archive EHV-1 strains for respective molecular characterization and molecular epidemiological investigations [32] . Practically speaking for diagnostic laboratories, should there be evidence of potential legal action regarding the source of infection, saving tissues positive by molecular tests could be archived.

MLV strains may replicate in the host. Replicating viruses have potential to spread within the host as evidenced by BVDV and BoHV-1 in certain vaccines to cross the placenta resulting in fetal infections [1] . Prior studies have reported several different BoHV-1 MLV vaccine strains in respiratory tract samples from BRD cases [20, 30] . BVDV vaccine strains were cultured from lungs of cattle dying in feedlots [6] . In other species, the effects of vaccination on viral detection have been varied. In the review of the EHV-1 cited prior, the authors reported that specific studies had not been conducted to determine if the MLV vaccine strain of EHV-1 is detectable in nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs following vaccination [33] . However, a reference was cited where the MLV vaccine strain has been identified in aborted fetuses [35] There has not been exhaustive studies taking samples up to days after vaccination for the parenteral administered MLV vaccines. One study administered a MLV vaccine containing BoHV1, BVDV1a and BVDV2a to seronegative calves. Unvaccinated control calves (in a separate pen) were included along with pregnant cows housed with vaccinates [36] . Nasal swabs and peripheral blood was collected through day 42. The nasal swabs and blood were tested using virus culture in bovine monolayers and a gel-based PCR test. Serums of vaccinates and controls were tested for viral antibodies to BoHV1, BVDV1, and BVDV2. All nasal swabs were negative for BoHV1 and BVDV in all collections. The buffy coat samples of vaccinates were negative except for 9/18 vaccinates BVDV positive on day 7 or 10 only while all other collections were negative. All blood samples were negative for BoHV1. All nasal swab collections were negative by gel-based PCR for BoHV1 and BVDV. There were PCR positives in blood samples 14/18 vaccinates for BVDV at days 3, 7, or 10 after vaccination. Control calves and contacts were negative by virus isolation and PCR in all collections. The control calves and contacts with vaccinates remained seronegative though out the study. While a transient viremia (cell culture positive) and blood positive by PCR occurred after vaccination, there was no evidence of viral shedding [36] . If virus is found in MLV vaccinates, the detection of MLV strains in calves' nasal secretions receiving parenteral vaccines by label route does not mean calves are capable of infecting other animals.

qRT-PCR for the 114 nasal swabs and 7 necropsy cases. Whereas cultures and G-PCR are given for all 5 viruses, the two real time PCR assays only detected 4 viruses, not PI3V. Ct values for each q-PCR or qRT-PCR positive animal are listed for BoHV-1, BVDV, BoCV, and BRSV. The vaccine/field status is listed. For BVDV, those positive for MLV virus have the subgenotype listed. Similarly most of this information is listed for the necropsy cases along with histopathology inTable 5. Of the 114 nasal swabs and if an animal was positive by at least one test for each virus, 87/114 (76.3%) were positive for any of the targeted viruses (48/49 in Group 1, 21/29 in Group 2, 18/26 in Group 3; total 87/114). All seven necropsy cases had a virus positive test. Using positive results for each type of test and regardless of virus each test detected positives on the 114 nasal swabs: (1) G-PCR (5 viruses), 44/114 (38.6%), q-PCR and qRT-PCR (4 viruses), 81/114 (71.6%), and culture (in MDBK and HRT monolayers), 40/114 (35.1%). The q-PCR and qRT-PCR tests identified more virus positives in nasal swabs than either G-PCR or virus positives in cell cultures (P value = 0.0001). For necropsy cases, 5/7 were positive by a G-PCR test, 5/7 by both real time PCR tests, and all 7 were culture positive. When all tests on nasal swabs were counted and if the animal was positive of at least one of the three tests, there were 14/114 (12.3%) positive for BoHV-1, 14/114 (12.3%) for BVDV, 74/114 (64.9%) for BoCV, 10/114 (8.8%) for BRSV, and 8/114 (7.0%) for Pl3V. Adding in positives for each virus in the necropsy cases for a total of 121 cases there were 18/121 (14.9%) positive for BoHV-1, 19/121 (15.7%) positive for BVDV, 76/121 (62.8%) positive for BoCV, 11/121 (9.1%) positive for BRSV, and 10/121 (8.3%) positive for PI3V. Table 6 summarizes the results based on positive outcome by each test. Of 114 nasal swabs there were 15/114 positive for BoHV-1 by the G-PCR test, 12/114 positive by the q-PCR tests, and 13/114 positive by culture. For BVDV testing of nasal swabs 6/114 were positive by BVDV G-PCR, 13/114 positive by qRT-PCR tests, and 12/114 positive by culture. The qRT-PCR BoCV testing for 114 swabs had 72/114 positive, 30/114 by G-PCR, and 21/114 by culture. There were 47/49 animals in Group 1 positive for BoCV by the qRT-PCR test. For the 121 total samples (114 nasal swabs and 7 necropsy cases, there was an exceptionally large number of qRT-PCR BoCV positives, 74/121 (61.2%) compared to 30/121 (24.8%) for the G-PCR and 21/121 (17.4%) for culture of BoCV. The qRT-PCR test detected greater number of BoCV positives in nasal swabs than either G-PCR or virus culture (P value = 0.0001). For BRSV testing 9/114 were positive by G-PCR, 10/114 by qRT-PCR and none culture positive. The qRT-PCR for PI3V was not available. There was only 1/114 positive for PI3V by the G-PCR and 8/114 positive by culture. Seven necropsy cases had 2/7 positive for BoHV-1 by G-PCR, 2/7 positive by q-PCR and qRT-PCR, and 4/7 positive by culture. BVDV testing of necropsy cases had 3/7 positive by G-PCR, 3/7 positive by qRT-PCR, and 5/7 positive by culture. BRSV testing found 1/7 positive by G-PCR, 1/7 positive by qRT-PCR and none positive by culture.
