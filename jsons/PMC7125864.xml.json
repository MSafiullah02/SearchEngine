In the real world, there are usually only a few infection sources in the early stage of the spreading process. However, it is possible that these infected sources spread the epidemic to large area in the world within a few days if the epidemic is ineffectively controlled [5], such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and swine flu [6]. An immediate concern, therefore, is the development of the effective countermeasures against epidemics, wherein immunization science plays an important, if not critical, role. A feasible and effective immunization strategy can save thousands of human lives with low cost. Over the past decades, many immunization strategies have been extensively investigated [7], [8], [9]. So far, it is still an open problem.",

For a given fraction of immunized nodes, a good immunization strategy should make the susceptible size, which is always dependent on the largest connected component of a network, as small as possible [17], [6]. It is widely accepted that the most efficient immunization strategies are based on targeted strategies [18], [19], [17].

It was also extended to the multilayer networks in [21], [22]. However, those strategies always neglect some important nodes without larger degree, such as in community networks.

[24] (where the giant cluster of local flows disintegrates when the second largest cluster reaches its maximum), the main idea of the proposed method is to find the critical nodes, which lead to the emergence of the giant connected component, for immunizing. Different from the degree centrality immunization strategy, the proposed method can find the critical nodes which may be not holding the largest degree. In addition, our method works only based on the degree property compared to Refs. [23], [24]. To test the performance of our proposed strategy, we conduct the experiments on Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks [28], scale-free (SF) networks [29] and also several real-world networks. The results show that the proposed method has 18% to 50% improvement than the degree centrality strategy, the betweenness centrality strategy and the adaptive degree centrality strategy (for the networks studied here).",

In the SIR model, each node belongs to one state of the susceptible state, the infected state and the recovered state. At the initial stage, the immunized nodes are removed from the network, including the incident links. We set one node that is randomly selected from the remaining network or networks (may be some disconnected subnetworks after immunized) to be infected to investigate the transmissibility of this node, and the others to be susceptible. At each time step, the infected nodes infect its susceptible neighbors with infection rate \u03bb, and they recover with rate \u03b7. The recovered nodes are removed from the network. This process is repeated until there is no infected node in the network. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 5\nand Fig. 6\n. In the simulations we use \u03bb=0.4 and \u03b7=0.05 for strong infection situation.

In the disassortative networks, high degree nodes mostly have neighbors with a small number of connections. Our strategy identifies the critical node only based on the largest and the second-largest connected components. It is expected that the proposed strategy will immunize or remove some low degree nodes (shown as Fig. 8\n(a) where q<0.078(F>0.84) and Fig. 8(b) where q<0.0518(F>0.8)), which is the critical node of two components, at the early stage.

The immunization threshold qc is quickly reached after those low degree nodes removal (q:0.078\u21920.109(F<0.04) on the BA network and q:0.0518\u21920.0711(F<0.04) on the email-Enron network).

            "text": "In this letter, we have developed and applied a novel method as an efficient network immunization strategy based on the percolation transition. The proposed strategy chooses the immunization fraction of nodes by repeatedly looking for the critical node, which leads to the emergence of the giant connected component as the degree threshold increases, in the largest connected network. To test the performance of the proposed method, we conduct the experiments on several artificial and real-world networks. The results show that the proposed method is more effective in assortatively mixed networks. In the disassortative networks, our strategy performs worse than other methods when low immunized fraction of nodes is conducted. However, it will outperform the others if we increase the immunized fraction of nodes. To summarize, our strategy holds the advantage of 18% to 50% compared to the degree centrality strategy, the betweenness centrality strategy and the adaptive degree centrality strategy.",
