Ten different TLRs have been identified in humans, all of which detect PAMPs either on the cell surface or the lumen of intracellular vesicles, such as endosomes or lysosomes, and are involved in the recognition of a particular type of PAMP [6]. TLRs recognize different pathogen components, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (TLR-3), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (TLR-7), or CpG DNA [6, 9, 10].

This receptor is associated with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). IFN-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b2 binding to IFNAR activates JAK1 and TYK2, which subsequently phosphorylate the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 [13], among other less characterized transcription factors such as STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5. Once phosphorylated, these factors associate with IRF-9 to form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex (ISGF3).

Some ISGs have been widely studied; the best known members include IFN dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), 2\u2032-5\u2032oligoadenilate synthetase (OAS), IFN-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM), dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR), and Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) and B (MxB) [16, 17].",

For example, PKR, which was among the first ISG described, is a PRR that recognizes dsRNA, inducing IFN production and further ISG production [18]. PKR inactivates eIF-2\u03b1, leading to a global translation blockage of both viral and cellular mRNA [19]. OAS is also activated by cytoplasmic dsRNA and is subsequently involved in the degradation of RNA (through RNAse L), contributing to the inhibition of protein synthesis and therefore viral replication [20]. In the case of IFITM, the four members (IFITM-1, IFITM-2, IFITM-3, and IFITM-5) are present in endosomes and lysosomes and have a critical role in the inhibition of viruses that require vesicles for effective infection [21]. ADAR is a nucleic acid editing enzyme that disrupts base pairing. ADAR catalyzes the deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in dsRNA, inducing the replacement of the AU base pair by IU, which produces dsRNA destabilization [22]. On the other hand, MxA and MxB play a critical role during viral entry; while MxA acts in the early stages of infection once the virus has traversed the plasmatic membrane, MxB acts at the nuclear stage, inhibiting nuclear entrance [23, 24].",

Upon activation and production of IFN, pDCs mature into antigen-presenting cells (APC) serving as a key link between the innate and adaptive immune responses [28]. In addition, DCs produce IL-12, which drives na\u00efve T cells into Th1-type responses, as well as IFN-\u03b1, which increases the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+ T cells [29]. Moreover, IFN-I also boost natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cell responses, promoting both survival and clonal expansion of the latter [30\u201332]. IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 lead to an immediate innate antiviral response and stimulate the adaptive immune system, affecting myeloid cells, NK cells, T cells, and B cells to mount an adequate Th1-biased immune response [16, 33].",

On the other hand, LGP2 has been related to the regulation of RIG and MDA5 activation [48]. Two different TLRs are activated by influenza virus, TLR-3 and TLR-7. The stimulation of TLR-3 in DCs and macrophages signal through TRIF, activating IRF-3/ NF-\u03baB, leading to IFN-\u03b2 secretion. On the other hand, TLR-7 in DCs activates MyD88, which activates IRF-7 and produces the secretion of both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 [49, 50].",

Originally, Hall et al. detected that increased IFN production in nasal washes in children infected with influenza virus was associated with decreased shedding of virus [65]. Subsequent studies identified the high levels of IFN-I in breastfeeding children infected with influenza virus, providing support to the hypothesis that breastfeeding protects against respiratory viral infection [66, 67]. Additionally, a study of elderly subjects demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 production is decreased during influenza virus infection and suggested that this impairment can produce multiple defects in their innate and adaptive immune responses that could lead to increased severity [68]. Likewise, other studies have shown that pregnant women have an attenuated IFN-\u03b1 response to influenza virus [69].",

TLR-3 detects dsRNA during viral replication and signals through TRIF, which activates IFN-\u03b1 production through NF-\u03baB and IRF-3 pathway [74]. Other important PRRs for IFN-I production are RIG-I and MDA5 which subsequently link MAVS. This recruits TRAF2/6 and TRAF3 which leads to the activation of IRF-7 and IRF-3 through NF-\u03baB [75]. Together, these IRFs stimulate ISRE sequences that promote IFN-I production [76, 77]. NLRs also play a role in activating the IFN-I pathway. NOD-2 can recognize RSV ssRNA, thus, mediating IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB activation pathways and leading to the IFN-\u03b2 production [78].",

Unlike other respiratory viruses, studies have shown a limited role for IFNs in response to RSV infection [65, 79, 80]. Thereby, NS1 and NS2 (2 proteins encoded by RSV) appear to interact (and interfere) with multiple molecules of the IFN pathway (RIG-I, TRAF3, and IRF-3), which then interfere with IFN synthesis [81\u201384] (Figure 3). Studies of RSV NS1 and NS2 proteins have demonstrated that they are crucial for virus replication in vitro, however, through IFN-I antagonism, they contribute to adequate RSV replication in vivo (and in vitro) [85]. Using interference RNA that allowed the inhibition of NS1, the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 was augmented and this increase was associated with a reduction in viral titer [86]. On the other hand, NS2 has been shown to be the main IFN-I antagonist related to the STAT-2 pathway [82, 87], thus, inhibiting IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 responses through JAK/STAT signaling [82, 88].",

This analysis of developmental innate immunity associated with poor IFN-I production during the first year of life suggests a role for IFN-I in RSV pathogenesis.

Early studies published by Dinwiddie et al. showed that hMPV can inhibit the IFN-\u03b1 pathway in A549 cells. Therefore, this virus abolished the IFN-\u03b1 pathway and downstream ISG signaling through mechanisms that regulate STAT1 activation [97]. One study supporting this information found that hMPV suppressed IFN-I responses through mechanisms involving the regulation of STAT1, STAT2, JAK1, TYK2, and the surface expression of IFNAR1 [98]. hMPV proteins impair the activation of PPRs through several different mechanisms. hMPV M2-2 protein interferes with MyD88 adaptor, a critical component for the activation of proinflammatory genes. This protein also interacts with MAVS, altering the production of IFN-\u03b2 and also prevents IRF-3 phosphorylation [99]. In addition, hMPV G protein alters the recognition by RIG-I thereby influencing the secretion of IFNs, and the small hydrophobic protein can inhibit NF-\u03baB, which is an important component in the IFN pathway [100]. Finally, the hMPV phosphoprotein B1 interferes with RIG-I recognition [75].",

As mentioned above, pathogen RNA synthesis provides strong stimuli to mount an IFN immune response. PIV-1 and PIV-3 encode C proteins, while PIV-2 encodes a V protein. Both proteins, C and V, are involved in the blockade of IFN-I induction by preventing PKR activation [107\u2013110]. The viral strategy in the case of PIV-1 and PIV-3 is to avoid the IFN production. PIV-1 does not inhibit the IFN pathway, given that the synthesis of the viral RNA can activate IFN production. Rather, the viral C protein modulates its RNA production, preventing MDA5 activation [109, 111]. This protein also interferes with STAT1, avoiding signaling through this pathway and thus IFN production [112]. The V protein of PIV-2 interferes with the IFN production in different ways. One of the mechanisms is the inhibition of MDA5 activation [113]. In addition, the highly conserved V protein Cys-rich domain has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to limit the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [114]. Finally, the V protein interferes with the IFN pathway by abolishing STAT2 signaling [115]. Interestingly, there is evidence that shows that this protein also regulates viral RNA production (as PIV C protein) [116].",

TLR-2 on the cell surface recognizes the virus capsid, even without viral replication. In addition, TLR-3, TLR-7, and TLR-8 localized in intracellular compartments are stimulated once the viral particle is internalized and the dsRNA/ssRNA is sensed [120]. The TLR stimulation leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules that activate IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-\u03baB, triggering IFN-I secretion. The evidence regarding TLR-3 is somewhat unclear; while one study described an important role for this receptor in the host response against the HRV infection [121], others found no function for this PRR [120]. The HRV genome is also recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 (both localized in the cytosol) which can recognize ssRNA and dsRNA, respectively. The RLR stimulation leads to the activation of MAVS and the consequent activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF, triggering the production of IFN-I in the airway cells [120, 122, 123]. Responses mediated by IFN-I in vivo are critical for the antiviral effects that limit HRV through the activation of NK cells [124].",

They are a large group of positive-sense ssRNA genome viruses that can infect mammals and birds, causing a wide variety of diseases which can lead to frequent mutations and infections of new species. They have been divided into four genera, two of which, alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus contain viruses infecting humans [133]. To date, four HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) circulate globally in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans [134]. HCoVs had been regarded as mildly pathogenic until the early 2000s. At that time, a new disease appeared in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was quickly attributed to a new HCoV, the SARS-CoV. Following that outbreak, a related but different HCoV producing severe respiratory disease emerged, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [135]. Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged. The 2019-nCoV is causing an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in patients. It initially began in Wuhan, China and has spread to many countries worldwide [136].",

The papain-like protease (PLPRO) domain of NS protein-3 of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 inhibits the activation of IRF-3 [142, 143]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that PLPRO encoded by MERS-CoV suppresses the induction of IFN-\u03b2 through its deubiquitinating activity [144]. Protein M of SARS-CoV inhibits IFN-I production by impeding the formation of the TRAF3-TANK-TBK1/IKK\u03f5 Complex [145].

            "text": "DENV nonstructural proteins have been involved in the downregulation of the IFN pathway in humans, targeting important signaling molecules downstream of PRRs, resulting in the inhibition of IFN-regulated gene expression [177]. NS4B in combination with NS2A and NS4A have been reported to block IFN-I signaling by decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation in human A549 cells [178]. Furthermore, the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease complex has been involved in the cleavage of the human adaptor molecule STING or MITA, inhibiting IFN-I production [179, 180]. Interestingly, DENV cleaves STING in humans but not in nonhuman primates that may serve as its sustaining reservoir in nature [181]. In addition, the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease interacts with the cellular I\u03baB kinase, an important kinase involved in the IFN-I induction, disrupting RIG-I signaling and inhibiting the IFN production [182]. The DENV polymerase NS5 has also been reported as a potent and specific IFN-I antagonist, due to its binding to human STAT2 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [183, 184]. The ability of DENV NS5 to bind and degrade human but not mouse STAT2 may be the major reason behind DENV's efficient replication in human but not in wild-type mouse cells [185]. Recently, increased virulence of different type 1 DENV isolates has been associated with a higher capacity of NS proteins to suppress IFN signaling [186]. Likewise, sfRNA of DENV strains that are associated with greater epidemic potential prevents the ubiquitination-dependent activation of RIG-I by binding to the ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), subverting the RIG-I pathway, and consequently impairing IFN-I induction [162].",

            "text": "The viral control and immune regulation exerted by IFN-I in dengue patients and human cells infected with DENV have been studied in several reports [172, 173, 187\u2013189]. Even though a strong IFN-I response has been described in dengue patients, the association of this response with disease severity is controversial [188, 190\u2013192]. While some studies reported similar serum levels of IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 in DF and DHF in Thai and Mexican patients [188, 191], several other reports from Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Taiwan, India, and Thailand showed higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 in patients with milder dengue disease [77, 190, 193\u2013196], suggesting that a robust production of IFN-\u03b1 may be correlated with a better clinical condition with respect to dengue infection and disease progression. Conversely, a recent study from Paraguay reported higher levels of IFN-\u03b2 in severe vs. nonsevere dengue children [197]. Similarly, a study from Northeast Brazil described higher levels of IFN-\u03b2 in primary DHF patients compared to those with primary DF [198]. Considering the preexisting immunity of patients to DENV, several reports described higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 in patients undergoing primary infection compared to those with secondary DENV infections [77, 190, 192, 195], while other studies observed a similar expression of IFN-\u03b1 levels in both types of infections [197, 198]. Furthermore, different serum levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 have been reported in DENV-infected patients [192], probably due to the differential kinetics of IFN-I induction during DENV infection of human cells [199, 200].",

Since the first human ZIKV infection was reported in Uganda in 1964 [202], human ZIKV infections had remained sporadic and limited to small-scale epidemics in Africa and Southeast Asia for decades [203, 204], until 2007, when a large outbreak of Zika fever was reported on Yap Island (Micronesia) [205]. Over the next seven years, outbreaks were reported in other Pacific Islands [206]. In 2015, the largest outbreak of ZIKV ever reported began in Brazil, with a rapid expansion of the virus in South and Central America [207\u2013209]. Typically, ZIKV infections can be asymptomatic or manifested as a self-limiting febrile illness characterized by rash, headache, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and myalgia [204\u2013207, 209]. However, recent outbreaks in the South Pacific and Latin America reported severe neurological complications, including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) in adults and microcephaly in newborns [210\u2013212]. ZIKV has been shown to cross the placental barrier, disrupting brain development [213]. Recently, ZIKV spread by sexual contact has also been documented [214]. At present, there is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat ZIKV.",

            "text": "The induction of antiviral immune responses after ZIKV infection of human cells has been reported in several studies [215\u2013219]. The innate immune response after ZIKV infection of skin cells and endometrial stromal cells was characterized by a strongly enhanced IFN-\u03b2 gene expression and the induction of ISGs, including OAS, ISG15, and MX1 [215, 216]. Moreover, the transcription of PRRs such as TLR-3, RIG-I, and MDA5 has been reported to be induced upon ZIKV infection of human skin cells [215]. Similar to DENV, NLR (inflammasome) activation has also been reported in ZIKV infection of monocytes [220]. Elevated secretion of IFN-\u03b2 was also reported in human lung epithelial cells, which may delay the apoptosis exerted by ZIKV infection [217]. Schwann cells (SC), which play a central role in peripheral nerve disease and can be the target for damage in GBS, were susceptible to infection with ZIKV and YFV, but not DENV, and ZIKV infection of SC induced expression of IL-6, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb, IFIT-1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-23A mRNAs, and negative regulators of IFN signaling [218]. Furthermore, ZIKV infection of human DCs produced a strong induction of the RLR signaling pathway at the RNA transcription level, but ZIKV was able to block IFN-I signaling by targeting STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation [219].",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes IFN-I induction and signaling in human cells, which might contribute to the broad cellular tropism and persistence of ZIKV, have been reported in recent studies [159, 221\u2013223]. ZIKV NS1 has been reported to interact with RIG-I and downregulate the antiviral signaling pathway [224]. In addition, Donald et al. reported that sfRNA in ZIKV acts as the antagonist of RIG-I-dependent IFN production [161]. Furthermore, ZIKV NS4A impairs RLR-MAVS interaction and subsequent induction of antiviral immune responses by binding to the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of MAVS and thus blocking its accessibility by RLRs [225, 226]. ZIKV NS3 has been shown to antagonize antiviral gene induction by RIG-I and MDA-5 by binding to and sequestering the scaffold proteins 14-3-3\u03b5/\u03b7 [227]. ZIKV NS1, NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B have been shown to interact directly with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), required for the phosphorylation of IRF-3 [159, 228]. In addition, the NS2B-NS3 protease complex of ZIKV has been reported to impair the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of JAK1 and to block RLR-triggered apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the cooperation between NS1, NS4B, and NS2B-NS3 further attenuates antiviral immunity, by impairing IFN-induced degradation of NS2B-NS3 [159]. Similar to DENV, ZIKV NS5 has been reported as a potent antagonist of IFN-I responses by targeting human but not mouse STAT2 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [183, 185, 221, 222]. However, unlike DENV, ZIKV NS5 did not require the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR4 interaction, exhibiting a virus-specific mechanism [222]. In addition, ZIKV NS1 and NS5 interact with NLRP3 and promote assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex resulting in IL-1\u03b2 production and stimulated ZIKV replication [229\u2013231].",

However, no effective prophylactic or therapeutic measures are currently available [234]. Infection with WNV in humans remains asymptomatic and/or subclinical in most cases and causes symptoms in 20-30% of WNV-infected individuals.

The studies of IFN-I protection after WNV infection are more limited in human cells. Recently, the PI3K, which play an important role in the induction of IFN-I antiviral responses, have been shown to control West Nile virus infection in human and mouse cells [238]. The presence of PI3K inhibitors blocked the translocation of IRF-7 from the cytosol to the nuclei, reduced IFN-I mRNA and protein expression, and decreased the secretion of IFN-I. Recently, in human monocyte-derived DCs early activation of RLR or IFN-I signaling could block WNV infection [239]. Furthermore, in human glioblastoma cells, WNV replication was regulated by early IFN-\u03b2 induction, while in human neuroblastoma cells, a delayed IFN-\u03b2 response, due to the concealing of viral dsRNA in intracellular membranes, resulted in efficient WNV replication [240]. In addition, differences in replication and induction of IFN-I responses between attenuated and virulent WNV strains in human monocyte-derived DCs accounted for the differing virulence in humans [241].",

            "text": "Upon recognition of viral infection, the cell, through PRRs, mediates the production of IFN-I leading to the transcription of hundreds of ISGs by the JAK/STAT pathway [301]. ISGs are the effectors of cell-autonomous antiviral defense and have been shown to be very effective at resisting and controlling pathogens. ISGs are induced to vastly different levels during viral infection or IFN treatment, and expression levels are often dependent on time, dose, and cell type. They act at different stages of the viral life cycle, from entry, replication, assembly, and release, providing adequate cellular immunity against both RNA and DNA viruses [302]. Microarray studies have identified between 50\u20131000 ISGs, with 200\u2013500 genes typical of many cell types. Representative and well-studied ISG members with specific or broad antiviral activities include IRF1, IRF3, IRF7, IRF9, IFITM3, ISG15, and OASL. The products of these ISGs exert numerous antiviral effector functions, many of which are still not fully described. However, as the mechanisms of more IFN effectors are uncovered, it is likely that their modes of action will collectively span the majority of virus life cycle stages [303]. In addition to having potent antiviral activity, ISGs also augment the innate immune response to viral infection, thereby strengthening this response [304]. This has driven special attention in the attempt to advance novel therapeutics to control viral infection and their pathogenesis.",

Viperin interacts with the cellular enzyme farnesyl diphosphatesynthase to perturb lipid rafts, resulting in inhibition of influenza and rhinovirus release [305, 306]. In addition, ZAP, which can be upregulated independently from IFN production, limits influenza virus replication via the enhancement of RIG-I [307]. TRIM56 is another ISG with broad antiviral activity. Although its upregulation is dependent on IFN-I, it abrogates influenza virus A and B and HCoV infection through STING and TLR-3/TRIF [308, 309]. TRIM21 has shown activity against rhinovirus by intercepting incoming antibody-opsonized virions during cellular infection, mediating efficient postentry neutralization [310]. A new human IFN-induced gene that we have termed ISG20 codes for a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease with specificity for single-stranded RNA and, to a lesser extent, for DNA. ISG20-overexpressing HeLa cells showed resistance to infections by the influenza virus. The mechanism has been shown to be related to the impairment of the polymerase activity, inhibiting both the replication and transcription [311, 312]. Finally, TDRD7 (tudor domain containing 7) has shown activity against several paramyxoviruses, such as HPIV3 and RSV by interfering with the activation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK). The activation of AMPK is required for efficient replication. TDRD7 interferes with the activation of AMPK, limiting viral replication [313].",

The expression of IFN-I inducible ISGs such as IFITM2/3, viperin, ISG15, ISG20, OAS, BST2, RyDEN, TRIM69, and IFI6 has been shown to block DENV infection [314\u2013320] at multiple steps of the viral cycle. IFITM2 and IFITM3 disrupted the early steps (entry and/or uncoating) of DENV and WNV infection [314, 316]. In contrast, three IFN-induced cellular enzymes, viperin, ISG20, and dsRNA-activated protein kinase, inhibited the steps of the DENV and WNV cycle in viral proteins and/or RNA biosynthesis [314]. DENV infection-induced viperin which has antiviral properties residing in the C-terminal region of the protein that acts to restrict early DENV RNA production/accumulation, potentially via the interaction of viperin with DENV NS3 and replication complexes [315]. The expression of the Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN) conferred resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells [317]. OAS and its downstream effector RNase L have been reported to block DENV replication and likely contributed to host defense against DENV infection playing a role in determining the outcomes of DENV disease severity [318]. ZIKV has been reported to induce the expression of ISG15 in primary human corneal epithelial cells, and the silencing of ISG15 increased ZIKV infectivity [321]. ISG15 has also inhibited the replication of several flaviviruses, including DENV, WNV, and JEV [322\u2013324]. IFN-\u03b1-inducible protein 6 (IFI6), an endoplasmic reticulum- (ER-) localized integral membrane effector, prophylactically protected uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations that house flavivirus (YFV, WNV, and DENV) replication machinery [320]. TRIM69 interacts with DENV NS3 directly and mediates its ubiquitination and degradation, thus, interrupting DENV replication [319]. Recently, Schlafen 11, an ISG that controls the synthesis of proteins by regulating tRNA abundance, has been reported to restrict WNV, DENV, and ZIKV replication by impairing viral infectivity [325].",
