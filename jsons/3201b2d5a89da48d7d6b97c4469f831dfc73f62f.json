Inadvertent intubation should be urgently de-escalated once a diagnosis is made. Emergent electroencephalography (EEG) is invaluable for non-convulsive events. In the absence of neurology support, convulsive SE presentations associated with diagnostic doubt, should be treated as convulsive SE to minimize risk from systemic or cerebral complications which could occur if untreated. Convulsive (tonic-clonic) SE: Given possible delays before hospitalization, patients or carers of those with benzodiazepine rescue plans should have the appropriate rescue medication supplied. Pre-hospital and hospital teams should use local or national protocols to appropriately treat convulsive SE with weight-based drug dosing administered promptly (3). Intravenous options include fosphenytoin (20mg PE/kg, max 1500mg PE/dose); valproate (40mg/kg, max 3000mg/dose), levetiracetam (60mg/kg, max 4500mg/dose).
