We have analyzed the trends of incident cases, deaths, and intensive care unit admissions (ICU) in both countries before and after their respective national lockdowns using an interrupted time-series design. Data was analyzed with quasi-Poisson regression using an interaction model to estimate the change in trends. After the first lockdown, incidence trends were considerably reduced in both countries. However, although the slopes have been flattened for all outcomes, the trends kept rising. During the second lockdown, implementing more restrictive measures for mobility, it has been a change in the trend slopes for both countries in daily incident cases and ICUs. This improvement indicates that the efforts overtaken are being successful in flattening the epidemic curve, and reinforcing the belief that we must hold on.",

Similarly, Spain imposed a lockdown on March 16th , with social distancing measures similar to those established in Italy. Two weeks later, on March 30th, Spain also implemented a more restrictive lockdown, aimed at reducing the mobility and non-essential industrial activity countrywide (Mitj\u00e0 et al., 2020) . These restrictive measures have mainly been focused on flattening the epidemic curve. Most of the results reported daily by Governments, official agencies, and the media are aimed at describing cumulative epidemic data. Conversely, little attention has been paid to describe, quantify, and compare the lockdown effects within and between countries from an epidemiological point of view using incident data.",

The trend slopes were considerably reduced for all the outcomes. However, this was not enough to change the rising trend of the epidemic. For this reason, more restrictive actions were suggested. The second lockdown, still ongoing, shows how the trends have changed, with a reduction of daily incident cases, deaths, and more significantly in ICUs. These are of similar magnitude in both countries, although Italy carries a week ahead of Spain. However, mortality still shows a small increase, probably because it follows incidence trends with a delay of 1-2 weeks. We should acknowledge that this figures could change during forthcoming weeks. Analysis of trends using daily incident data may be a useful complement to more conventional approaches used to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic by testing and reporting changes overtime after a public health intervention (i.e., lockdown, confinement or quarantine). Interrupted time-series regression models are relatively easy to implement using readily available data by health authorities (Bernal et al., 2017) . This is a descriptive analysis without predictive purposes. For an easy interpretation, and comparison of the effectiveness of lockdown measures between countries, a linear trend is assumed before and during the lockdown periods. The changes in the definition of diagnosed cases have not been taken into account, nor has the reduction in the susceptible population because of the lockdown. Therefore, the incident cases are modeled directly instead of the incidence rate, assuming that the entire population is at risk.",

Although available data is still limited, and findings must be interpreted with caution, we believe that real-time detection of pattern changes are essential to evaluate the current measures of control and design future ones. In this sense, the positive signs already shown by the decreasing trend slopes after a more restrictive lockdown in Italy and Spain could indicate an optimistic and encouraging forecast for those countries that in late March also announced restrictive lockdown measures for flattening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve (e.g., the United Kingdom on March 23th or Ireland on March 27th). These results show that the sacrifices that our society is making are gaining us valuable time, which is essential to get ready to face the future pressures that this epidemic will bring forth.",
