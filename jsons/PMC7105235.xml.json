The most common cause of osteonecrosis is trauma, which leads to mechanical interruption of nutrient delivery to the bone, but there are many non-traumatic causes or associations as well. By far the most well known association is related to the use of corticosteroids, but other iatrogenic causes including alcoholism, radiation treatment, bisphosphonate use, and possibly even cigarette smoking, exist. Other etiologies for osteonecrosis include anatomical deformities such as Legg\u2013Perthes\u2013Calves disease, dislocation of a joint and slipped femoral capital epiphyses. Osteonecrosis has also been reported to occur as a result of exposure to hyperbaric conditions, and has been tenuously associated with conditions in which a lipid disorder exists, such as lipid storage diseases and even pregnancy. The list of potential causes is lengthy and beyond the scope of this article, the focus of which is to attempt to navigate the extensive literature on corticosteroid associated osteonecrosis in order to decipher trends in risk related to corticosteroid use.",

Since then, multiple reports of bone death have increased our awareness of the potential for the development of osteonecrosis in patients on corticosteroids [1], [2]. Steroid induced osteonecrosis has in fact been described in numerous publications, ranging from case reports to prospective studies. There is no doubt that there is a real risk of osteonecrosis with steroid use. However, it is often difficult to determine the extent of causality between steroid use and osteonecrosis because many of the conditions they are used to treat can also cause or predispose to osteonecrosis. Indeed, there appears to be a significant difference in the incidence of corticosteroid induced osteonecrosis depending on the underlying condition for which corticosteroids are administered. It is also not clear whether the risk of osteonecrosis is more closely related to cumulative dose, maximum dose or duration of therapy. Topical, inhaled and oral glucocorticoids are some of the most frequently used treatments for eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis, pulmonary diseases, autoimmune disease and other inflammatory diseases, and it is therefore vital to identify those at particular risk for complications.",

Multiple reports elucidating this connection have been published and a cause\u2013effect relationship is now well established. Early diagnosis has proven to be problematic as the majority of patients are asymptomatic until significant damage to bone has occurred. Osteonecrosis tends to occur in a younger, more active age group and because there are limited treatment options for advanced disease, early identification is vital. Multiple treatment options have been explored for osteonecrosis. Presently, the best option for preventing complete joint replacement is the diagnosis of subjects in earlier stages before the joint becomes compromised. Again, this emphasizes the importance of identifying high-risk patients as early as possible.",

The onset of steroid induced osteonecrosis is usually insidious or vague in early stages. Symptoms may not occur for weeks to up to a year after cessation of steroid use. The pain may be referred. For example, in osteonecrosis of the femoral head, unilateral hip pain is usually the presenting symptom, but pain may also be referred to the groin, thigh, knees or buttocks. The contralateral hip will become affected within 2 years in up to 55% of cases [1]. Function may be affected as well, and many patients will present with a painful limp, which is aggravated by weight bearing and partially relieved by rest. Progression of pain is common and in advanced disease, pain is also present at rest. Range of motion and disability are progressive in the late stages, and as hip arthroplasty becomes imminent, pharmacologic intervention is of suboptimal effectiveness and is limited to analgesics. Several classification systems have been proposed to grade the severity of osteonecrosis. In the Ficat and Arlet scheme, stages 1\u20132 are reversible while stages 3\u20134 denote end stage disease with irreversible damage.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis and immunology of osteonecrosis will be discussed in subsequent articles in this series on osteonecrosis. In 2008, Motomura et al. [10] described the relationship between steroid dosing and osteonecrosis in rabbit models. Rabbits were treated with 1, 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg of methylprednisolone (MPSL), resulting in incidence of osteonecrosis of 0, 42%, 70%, and 96%, respectively. Histologically, reparative tissues around the osteonecrosis sites were observed in the rabbits with 5 mg/kg MPSL, but not observed in rabbits with 20 and 40 mg/kg MPSL. On hematological examination, hyperlipidemia and thrombocytopenia were most apparent in the rabbits receiving 40 mg/kg MPSL. Overall, this study highlights the statistically significant association of dose and osteonecrosis occurrence, and suggests that hyperlipidemia is important in its pathophysiology. Similarly, Yamamoto et al. [11], examined the effect of pulsed doses of methylprednisolone acetate on bone and bone marrow tissue in rabbits, and observed the formation of osteonecrosis at 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks. Forty-three percent of the rabbits developed osteonecrosis in multiple sites by the fourth week after injection with 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone. Other factors related to altered lipid metabolism also were found to be present, including fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, and intraosseous fat embolism. In 2009, Yang et al. [137], studied mouse models of steroid induced osteonecrosis. Interestingly, the authors found discontinuous therapy was less osteonecrotic than continuous dexamethasone treatment, consistent with the possible benefits of a \u201csteroid holiday\u201d seen in clinical settings.",

This was found to be uncommon with only 2 case reports of isolated IM or IA injection and subsequent osteonecrosis [12], [13]. The remainder of reported IA/IM associated cases includes concurrent or subsequent addition of other steroid routes of administration (inhaled, oral, pulse, topical, and repeated IA/IM injections). Interpretation of case reports of osteonecrosis linked to topical steroids was limited. Of the 5 described cases, 4 were treated with long term topical preparations from 2 to 20 years with rough cumulative doses ranging widely from 1 to 15,000 mg prednisone equivalent. The majority of cases were also treated with additional preparation(s) of oral or inhaled steroids. Thus, osteonecrosis is likely to be an exceedingly rare phenomenon with topical steroids alone and is more likely to occur after prolonged therapy with cumulative doses and concurrent use of additional steroid therapy preparations. The risk of osteonecrosis from inhaled steroids is of concern given the vast number of steroid inhalers prescribed for asthma. In theory, the cumulative dose of inhaled steroid over a lifetime could add up to sizeable amounts. However, conclusions regarding steroid risk are again difficult to draw from the 4 reported cases related to inhaled steroids [14], [15], [16], [17] because all cases were concurrently or subsequently treated with oral steroids prior to the diagnosis of osteonecrosis. Though no studies have been performed, the recent unapproved but commonplace use of swallowed ultra high dose inhaled steroids (specifically fluticasone dipropionate) to treat eosinophilic esophagitis will increase the risk of osteonecrosis in these patients.",

Out of these 16 studies, 6 studies did not find a statistically significant correlation between daily steroid dosing (mean or maximal daily dosing) and the development of osteonecrosis [26], [27]. Interestingly, the majority of the negative association occurred in papers prior to 1978 [19], [28], [29], [30]. In 1960, Dubois et al. [28] was the first to recognize a connection between SLE and development of osteonecrosis. However, he did not find a relationship to steroid dosing and occurrence, probably because patients had received high doses and the study was done before MRI. Similarly, in 1974 and 1976, Bergstein et al. [19] and Smith et al. [30], respectively, found no correlation between daily steroid dosing and osteonecrosis. In 1978, Diamant et al. [29] failed to find a correlation between peak dose, duration or cumulative dose of steroid and osteonecrosis. However, since then, only 1 further study in 2010 by Nakumura et al. [26], echoed this negative correlation. The authors of this study concluded that there is no statistically significant difference in the highest daily dose of steroids in osteonecrosis and non-osteonecrosis groups (p = 0.072), though the p-value did approach significance. A major criticism of this study is that methylprednisolone pulse therapy was not reported or included in the data analysis and may have in turn, led to this negative conclusion.",

            "text": "Since 1978, the evidence is clear that there is a correlation between mean daily dose, maximal daily dose or high dose steroid therapy and the development of osteonecrosis. Massardo et al. [25], found a positive correlation with osteonecrosis and the use of prednisone doses greater than or equal to 40 mg/day. He further noted that high dose methylprednisolone therapy was also a risk factor and concluded that patients who developed osteonecrosis received a higher dose of steroid in a shorter period of time compared with those who did not develop osteonecrosis. Clearly, a lower dose of prednisone administered over a longer time would carry comparably increased risks. Statistical significance was reached with the MPSL data, but not the prednisone data. Ono et al. [31], found that both IV MPSL pulse therapy and prednisone > 30 mg/day for at least a month were risk factors for osteonecrosis. Zonana-Nacach et al. [32] also demonstrated that the risk of osteonecrosis significantly increased with exposure to high dose oral prednisone. He found that each 2 months of exposure to > 60 mg prednisone was associated with a 1.2 fold increased risk for development of osteonecrosis. In the meta-analysis by Felson et al. [21], there was a positive relationship between oral prednisone dose when evaluated at time intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, and the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. The authors suggested that steroid dose is the major factor in predicting the risk of osteonecrosis. The oral dose effect amounts to a 4.6% increase in the risk of AVN for every 10 mg/day rise in oral steroids during the first 6 months of therapy. Interestingly, they found no association if only a single bolus dose of steroids was used. In 2000, Oinuma et al. [27], found that osteonecrosis development occurred after high dose corticosteroid treatment, but was not related to highest daily dose. Migliaresi et al. [33] did not find an increase in osteonecrosis in methylprednisolone treated patients, even though they accumulated the highest dose. Mont et al. [34] found that SLE patients with osteonecrosis received higher maximal prednisone doses than those without osteonecrosis. Uea-areewongsa et al. [35] found that the use of steroids (recorded as maximum and mean daily dosing) were significantly higher in the osteonecrosis group compared to control. Gladman et al. [36] concluded that osteonecrosis was significantly associated with the use of steroid (OR = 19), and correlated with the maximal dose of steroids per day (OR = 1.02). In a multivariate analysis, only the use of steroids was statistically significant. Finally, the mean daily dose of prednisone for the highest month of therapy was > 40 mg/day in 93% and > 20 mg/day in 100% of patients who developed osteonecrosis [22]. The mean daily prednisone dose for the highest single month of treatment, as well as, the maximal dose during consecutive 3, 6, 12 months of therapy was significantly higher in patients with osteonecrosis [22]. This study reflects that higher daily dosing has a positive correlation to osteonecrosis development.",

            "text": "The correlation of higher cumulative dose and development of osteonecrosis has also been studied. In all, 13/20 SLE studies commented on cumulative dosing. Out of these 13 studies, 5 studies did not find an association with cumulative dosing [20], [21], [36], [37], [38], [39], while 8 studies did [19], [20], [21], [25], [36], [37], [39], [40]. With regard to positive correlation, Mok et al. [20] identified 38/143 subjects with osteonecrosis and found that the cumulative dose at 1 and 4 months was significantly higher in the SLE patients with osteonecrosis vs. without osteonecrosis (1.8 vs. 1.1 at 1 month and 4.5 vs. 2.8 g prednisone at 4 months). Jaovisidha et al. [37] found that the 2 patients who developed osteonecrosis had the longest duration of corticosteroid treatment and higher cumulative dose compared to the patients who did not develop osteonecrosis, but this was a small cohort of patients and limited conclusions can thus be drawn from it. In a retrospective, case control series, Gladman et al. [23] identified 95 patients with osteonecrosis out of a total of 744 SLE patients. Data analysis determined a minimally positive odds ratio of 1.04 for cumulative dose, which did not reach statistical significance. Weiner et al. [39], found that corticosteroid intake during the first 1.5 years after diagnosis of SLE and during the third year after diagnosis of SLE was significantly greater in the osteonecrosis vs. non-osteonecrosis group. Felson et al. [21], was the only metanalysis available and looked at 22 different studies with underlying disorders including renal transplant, SLE, BMT, and Hodgkin's disease. Limited conclusions can be deduced with respect to SLE and steroid dose as only 3/22 studies looked at an SLE cohort. When Felson et al. [21], compared steroid dose and bolus steroids, they calculated that a 9 g prednisone equivalent cumulative dosing given in a month had a 22% incidence of osteonecrosis. Further discussion of this paper will be included in subsequent sections as it applies. Massardo et al. [25] noted a positive correlation with osteonecrosis when patients were treated with a cumulative dose of \u2265 12 g/year. Finally Bergstein et al. [19], similarly found a positive correlation with cumulative dosing. Overall, the data indicates a correlation between higher cumulative dosing and increased risk for osteonecrosis.",

Interestingly, as seen with the SLE studies, the negative relationship, was only found in studies that were greater than 25 years old. Since then, there has been repeated and dramatic evidence of a dosing relationship to risk. In 2008, Shibatani et al. [45], performed a retrospective analysis of 150 renal transplant patients, 37 of whom developed osteonecrosis. The authors found a statistically significant dose\u2013response association at 8 weeks after transplantation. Considerable correlation with cumulative dose was found as will be described in the next section. The finding of significantly higher daily dose and risk was echoed in multiple studies [21], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50]. Koo et al. [7], found that high dose steroid during the first several weeks was more important that total cumulative dose. Patton et al. [49], noted that the mean linear trend of higher daily prednisone dose was also statistically significant (p < 0.03) for the development of osteonecrosis. In contrast to the SLE data, the majority of studies (17 of 22) in the Felson metanalysis were renal transplant studies. Overall, the general consensus among these studies is that a higher daily dose confers a significant risk for developing osteonecrosis. Unfortunately, due to the variation among studies, a recommendation for a universally \u201csafe\u201d steroid dose cannot be made and in all situations, physicians should exercise caution in using steroids and provide appropriate informed consent.",

[133] all found similar risk with increased cumulative dose. Several authors demonstrated evidence for increased risk when specifically considering cumulative IV methylprednisolone [21], [46], [53], [54], [55]. Lausten et al. [48], calculated that the incidence of femoral head osteonecrosis was more than halved with reduction of the cumulative steroid from 12 g to 6.5 g. De Graff et al. [52], found that a cumulative dose greater than 5000 mg during the first 3 months was a striking risk. Bradbury et al. [53] found a similar association between steroids used during the first year and subsequent risk of osteonecrosis. In 2002, Koo et al. [7], noted that daily oral dosing was more important than cumulative dose. In summary, the majority of the data on renal transplant-induced osteonecrosis indicates a positive role on cumulative dose and osteonecrosis development. Multiple confounding variables are at play here (i.e. active inflammation during rejection may predispose to osteonecrosis, MPSL vs. oral cumulative dosages may confer different risks).",

In 2002, Koo et al. [7], suggested that high dose steroids during the first several weeks seems to be more important that the cumulative dose. The major limitation here is that there was only 1 patient out of 22 that had a solid organ transplant (aside from renal). In 1994, Bradbury et al. [53] performed a retrospective study and found 3% of cardiac/pulmonary transplant patients developed osteonecrosis. The author demonstrated a correlation between cumulative dosing of IV MPSL in the first 1 month after transplant and the onset of osteonecrosis (p = 0.005). In summary, there is no significant data to make concrete statements regarding dosing relationship to osteonecrosis in solid organ transplant, though clearly there seems to be a trend towards higher daily and cumulative dose.",

When he adjusted for body weight, cumulative dose remained significantly associated with osteonecrosis (OR, 1.030; 95% CI, 1.005\u20131.055, p = 0.02). A logistic analysis further predicted that a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 2880 mg had a 20% chance of inducing osteonecrosis which was a 4.2-fold higher probability than a patient treated with a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 800 mg. In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients, Arico et al. [61], found that there was an increased incidence of osteonecrosis with chemotherapy regiments where the cumulative dose was higher. Mattano et al. [63], studied a pediatric ALL population and found a 1.4-fold increase in osteonecrosis in patients treated with 2 dexamethasone pulses as compared to those that received just one. However, the results did not reach statistical significance. Vaidya et al. [67], also agreed that the high cumulative doses of steroid were noted to have an increased risk of osteonecrosis in acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. In a small cohort of acute lymphocytic leukemia patients, Chan-Lam et al. [72] reported 5/9 patients with osteonecrosis, which he proposes may be explained by their protocol of higher dose steroids (1.5\u20131.75\u00d7 greater than in convention chemotherapy). Several other studies state that steroids play a role in osteonecrosis development [64], [68], [74].",
