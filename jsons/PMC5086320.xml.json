The ubiquitous nature, large population sizes, gregarious behaviour and high species diversity of bats combined with their close interactions with livestock, farms and humans likely facilitate their role as a source of zoonotic disease (Olival et al., 2012).",

Household heads were asked about the hunting of large fruit bats by family members and knowledge of bat hunters within their villages.

We constructed mixed\u2010effects logistic regression models to study the association between environmental factors and bat hunting activity at the household level. To build models, we first framed a causal diagram to identify associations between variables of interest and to identify confounders (Greenland et al., 1999). We constructed mixed\u2010effects models consisting of a single independent variable controlling for village clustering as a random effect. The presence of bat hunting at the household level was used as the dependent variable and the presence of bat roosts on the landowner's property, the presence of bats within the household complex and courtyards, the total number of fruit trees on the property, the dominance of trees which were highly attractive to fruit bats around the household, the number of Pteropus bats per square kilometre and population in the village, and two measures of household wealth were all identified as independent variables. To create a variable representing the attractiveness of fruit tress surrounding a household to fruit bats, we used tree counts and the report of bat visits to specific tree varieties provided by household heads. We designated fruit tree varieties with 90% or more of tree owners reporting bat visits as highly attractive to fruit bats and we designated households dominated by these trees at two levels (making up 50% and 80% of all trees planted on the property) in the analysis. These cut\u2010offs were selected as they represented an increasing gradient and had large enough populations in each group to allow for analysis. As proxies for household wealth (Kumar, 1989), we used two non\u2010colinear measures of household per capita wealth: the total number of fruit trees and the total number of livestock (which included cattle, buffalo, sheep, pigs, goats and horses) per number of people living in the compound. We then built a multivariable mixed\u2010effects logistic regression model, using information\u2010theoretic model selection to generate all possible combinations of the selected independent variables and selected the model with the lowest corrected Akaike information criterion (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).",

The presence or absence of bat hunting in each village was used as the dependent variable and was classified as true if either a household head reported hunting within their compound or a household head reported knowing bat hunters within the village. A single report of hunting was sufficient to classify a village as having bat hunters. The location of the village, the number of bats per square kilometre and the number of fruit trees per square kilometre were used as independent variables. Village locations were grouped into north\u2010west, north\u2010east, south\u2010west and south\u2010east quadrants based on their coordinates. We first built univariate models and then combined all independent variables into a single model. We tested for interactions between independent variables and used k\u2010fold cross\u2010validation to select the best multivariable model (Arlot and Celisse, 2010).",

Bat hunting did not increase with greater bat density per square kilometre, suggesting bat hunters are also seeking out and actively targeting the animals, even in areas where bats may be less abundant. Villagers use bats as both food and medicine, suggesting the utility of bats as a commodity. These uses might hint at bat hunting as a profitable enterprise in Bangladesh, although we did not specifically ask about this practice in this study.",

Because of this, there are limitations to our statistical inference. For example, we may be underappreciating trends, such as increased hunting with livestock ownership and with increasing ownership of mango and guava trees. Additionally, the data used in this analysis were not collected primarily for the purpose of studying bat hunting. A dedicated survey focused on bat hunting and exposures utilizing open\u2010ended questions would provide a more thorough explication of bat\u2013human interactions. The number of bats killed and other reasons for killing bats besides consumption and medicinal uses are missing from our data set. Questions regarding the frequency of bats hunted and killed for sport or for pest control are also notably missing from our survey. While we know that bat hunting is widespread, we do not know how many individuals participate in hunting. Nor do we have an understanding of the financial rewards of hunting or extent of markets where hunted bats might be sold. Finally, while our survey focused on large\u2010bodied fruit bats, with the intention of specifically studying interactions with Pteropus giganteus, we cannot confirm that villagers did not report interactions or the presence of other bat species.",

Hunting brings with it the handling, butchering and preparing of bats, and these activities all increase the chances of handlers being bitten or exposed to bat tissues and bodily fluids. These exposures all likely increase the risk of zoonotic disease spillover. Butchering of bats has been linked to spillover of a Nipah\u2010like henipavirus in Cameroon (Pernet et al., 2014) and the bat bush meat exchange has been directly tied to at least one outbreak of Ebola (Leroy et al., 2009). The presence of bat hunting in Bangladesh is concerning given that Nipah virus infection is enzootic in Pteropus bats, and exposure to the pathogen through hunting or bat bush meat processing or consumption might be a potential spillover pathway. However, at this time, no association between bat hunting and Nipah virus infection in humans has been uncovered in investigations of Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh (Hossain et al., 2008; Rahman et al., 2012; Hegde et al., 2013).",

Pteropus bats are recognized as a key species in pollination and seed dispersal of economically important trees throughout South Asia and their excrement and dropped fruit spats below roosting sites play an important role as natural organic manures (Fujita and Tuttle, 1991; Goveas et al., 2006). The low reproductive and high natural mortality rates of Pteropus species make them vulnerable to over\u2010hunting (McIlwee and Martin, 2002). Local management of fruit bat hunting has been suggested to avoid over\u2010hunting (Epstein et al., 2009). A survey of bat species in Bangladesh suggests that Pteropus bats are threatened due to destruction of roosting sites and exploitation of natural resources (Khan, 2001). While it is unclear from our study how many bats are killed by hunters in Bangladesh, it is clear that this behaviour is widespread, and further studies of the impact of hunting would help determine whether this activity threatens ecologically important Pteropus populations.",
