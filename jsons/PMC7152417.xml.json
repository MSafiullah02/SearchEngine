            "text": "Any disease of poultry can adversely affect egg production and quality either directly, by having effects on the reproductive system, or indirectly, by affecting the health of the bird. Respiratory infections which result in air sacculitis may, in turn, infect the ovary and oviduct. In addition, some diseases infect the oviduct and ovary by ascending infection. It is frequently difficult to diagnose the cause or causes of reduced egg quality because it is often a combination of factors that leads to poor egg quality. Management, nutrition and disease may, in combination, result in a reduction in egg internal quality and/or egg shell quality. The most recent comprehensive review of diseases affecting egg quality is that of Spackman (1987) who, although focusing on egg shell quality, also discussed the effects of disease on egg internal quality. This chapter addresses diseases and syndromes which have been shown, or are reported to, have adverse effects on egg production and quality. Emphasis will be on developments since Spackman\u2019s 1987 review, except where earlier information is fundamental to the discussion. The main experimental developments that have occurred since Spackman\u2019s review are new information about the effect of Australian strains of infectious bronchitis virus on the oviduct and egg quality and the reporting of egg apex abnormalities caused by Mycoplasma synoviae (particularly in combination with infectious bronchitis virus).",

            "text": "\nSpackman (1987) states \u2018The role of Mycoplasmata in egg production and quality is somewhat controversial\u2019. At that time, it was not clear to what extent Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) or M. gallisepticum (MG), alone, were involved in abnormal eggshells and production losses and what was caused by interactions with other infectious agents such as infectious bronchitis virus (Giambrone et al., 1977). MG had been implicated in production losses and, in the case of breeder flocks, decreased hatchability. Until about 2000, the main concern in flocks of laying hens was Mycoplasma gallisepticum ( Kleven, 2008, Kleven et al., 1990; Stipkovits and Kempf, 1996; Yoder 1986) although there were reports of MS in layer flocks (Branton et al., 1989, Mohammed et al., 1986, Mohammed et al., 1987a, Mohammed et al., 1987b, Morrow et al., 1990, Opitz, 1983, Reece et al., 1986a). MS was regarded as being a problem predominantly in broiler and turkey flocks and has also been reported from other poultry species such as ducks (Bencina et al., 1988a, YAMADA and MATSUO, 1983), geese (Bencina et al., 1988b) and pigeons (Reece et al., 1986b). The production of eggs with abnormal shells has been reported for geese infected with Mycoplasma sp strain 1220 (Dobos-Kovacs et al., 2009). The vertical transmission of MS was recognized relatively early (Carnaghan, 1961, Macowan et al., 1984, Roberts and Mcdaniel, 1967). Both MG and MS have the potential to cause salpingitis in laying birds (Domermuth et al., 1967). Opitz (1983) reported MS infection on 48% of farms surveyed in Maine, US. Mohammed et al. (1986) reported prevalence of MG as 73% in southern California and 3% in central California and MS as 91% in southern California and 32% in central California. An economic analysis indicated that there was no association between MS infection and egg production but that MG resulted in an estimated 127 million eggs lost in southern California (Mohammed et al., 1987b).",

These abnormalities are characterized by changes in the colour and texture of the shell in the region of the air sac. When this region of the egg shell is observed under the scanning electron microscope, the mammillary layer and the lower part of the palisade layer are missing. These EAAs ceased after an injection of long-acting oxytetracycline but reoccurred 12 days later. The incidence of EEAs was higher in the presence of infectious bronchitis virus. The presence of EAAs was accompanied by shell thinning, increased translucency and reduced shell breaking strength. A later experiment with SPF white layers (Feberwee et al., 2009b) investigated the ability of an MS vaccine to protect against egg shell abnormalities in the presence of an infectious bronchitis challenge. EAAs were produced only in birds that were challenged with M. synoviae, whether or not they had been previously vaccinated for MS. Again, this eggshell abnormality was associated with reduced shell strength. Vaccination reduced the incidence and delayed the appearance of EAAs in eggs from birds challenged with MS but did not completely prevent the occurrence of EAAs.",

Many serotypes of E. coli are found in poultry but it is only the avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) which possess specific virulence factors and are capable of causing salpingitis and peritonitis (Landman and Cornelissen, 2006). Salpingitis may be caused by either a systemic infection or by ascending infection of the oviduct from the cloaca. The study of Ozaki and Murase (2009) reported postmortem findings of fibrinous exudates in the vagina, caseous exudates in the upper oviduct, degenerated ovaries and a thickened and oedematous oviduct mucosa. The stress associated with the onset of lay may act as a precipitating factor in colibacillosis outbreaks (\nZanella et al., 2000). Virulent Mycoplasma synoviae can act as a complicating factor in E. coli peritonitis syndrome (Raviv et al., 2007). However, Vandekerchove et al. (2004) concluded that colibacillosis outbreaks are not necessarily associated with other respiratory pathogens.",

Although there was no decline in egg production, there was a deterioration of egg internal quality (albumen) and a loss of egg shell colour (Chousalkar and Roberts, 2009). In addition, egg shape changed, with IB causing eggs to become more elongate. Studies of the histopathology of the oviduct of White Leghorn (Chousalkar et al., 2007a), Hy-Line Gray (Chousalkar et al., 2007b) and Isa Brown hens (Chousalkar et al., 2009a) as well as ultrastructural investigations (Chousalkar and Roberts, 2007a, Chousalkar and Roberts, 2007b, Chousalkar et al., 2009a) confirmed that IB induces pathology in various regions of the oviduct of laying hens.

High levels of plasma oestradiol also increase the FLHS risk (Haghighi-Rad and Polin, 1981). Clinical signs are essentially mortality in full production and sudden drops in egg production. The disease can cause up to 5% mortality during the laying cycle (Julian, 2005). The liver is friable, enlarged, yellow, engorged with fat and haemorrhagic. Restricted feeding may prevent the disease. Fatty liver and hepatic steatosis is frequently confused with fatty liver syndrome. Hepatic steatosis is associated with a low protein and high energy level in the ration and causes little mortality and egg production drops (Julian, 2005).",

If Ca is insufficient in the diet, in order to produce eggs, hens withdraw the mineral from cortical bone. Phosphorus deficiency causes osteoporosis, often called cage layer fatigue. Phosphorus is essential to the medullary bone structure. Vitamin D3 deficiency results also in osteoporosis by affecting Ca metabolism. Adequate nutrition helps to reduce this disorder. More exercise results also in better bone quality but may not decrease the fracture incidence. Lines resistant to osteoporosis have been selected (Whitehead and Fleming, 2000).",
