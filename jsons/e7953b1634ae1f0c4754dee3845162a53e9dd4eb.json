            "text": "After World War II, industries began to produce a whole new generation of industrial and consumer goods made of synthetic organic chemicals such as plastics, solvents, detergents, and pesticides. Industries profited enormously from the production and marketing of these products and consumers became accustomed to the convenience of synthetic products as well as cheap, convenient, throwaway packaging materials. As the industrial production of these products increased, so did the production, accumulation, and disposal of hazardous waste. Prior to 1976, facilities that handled and/or disposed of hazardous waste were not provided with detailed regulations and/or guidance on proper waste handling/ disposal techniques and, as a result, there were many instances where hazardous waste was improperly disposed. When chemicals are improperly disposed in the environment, abandoned hazardous waste sites are created that potentially affect human health and cost our society billions of dollars due to the high cost of not only evaluating human health and environmental impacts but also to performing site clean-ups. An example of one of the most well known incidents of improper disposal of hazardous waste was the Love Canal environmental pollution incident [ 1] . This incident led to the passage of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. This act gave the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulatory control of all stages of the hazardous waste management cycle from the \"cradle-to-grave:' Beginning in the 1970s, Congress passed several other acts designed to protect human health and the environment ( Table 1 ) .",

Other effects, such as organ damage due to metals and solvents, may not become manifested for months or years after first exposure. The time from the first exposure to the observation of a health effect is called the latent period. The length of this period is dependent on various factors such as the type of pathology induced by the compound/chemical of potential concern (COPC), dose, dose rate as well as host characteristics such as age at first exposure, gender, race, species, and strain. Other host factors that influence susceptibility to environmental exposures include genetic traits; preexisting diseases; behavioral traits such as smoking; coexisting exposures; and medication and vitamin supplementation [ 5] . Genetic studies include investigations of the effects of chemicals on the genes and chromosomes (genetic toxicology) and ecogenetics, a relatively new field, describes a host's genetic variation in predisposition and resistance to COPC exposure [5] . Ecogenetics involves studies of specific exposures ranging from pharmaceuticals known as pharmacogenetics, pesticides, inhaled pollutants, foods, food additives, to allergic and sensitizing agents [ 6] .",

The length of the induction period may be a function of the same variables as the latent period. Effective exposure time refers to the exposure time that occurred up to the point of induction [ 4] . Ineffective exposure is readily observed in dose-response curves as a saturation of response in the high dose range. An experimental study must follow the subjects beyond the length of the minimum latent period to observe all effects and cases associated with exposure. Under ideal circumstances, a study will follow subjects for their lifetime. Lifetime follow-up is common for animal studies but uncommon for epidemiology studies [ 4] .",

The 1999 draft cancer guidelines will serve as interim guidance until USEPA issues final cancer guidelines [ 43] . For evaluating chemical mixtures of noncarcinogens, Mumtaz and Durkin [9] suggest the interaction data (i.e., independent joint action, similar joint action and synergistic action) and the qualitative and quantitative interaction matrix be taken into consideration when determining the hazard index. A qualitative WOE scheme for evaluating chemical mixtures is shown in Table 3 . The WOE takes into consideration the COPC, data, reference doses/concentrations, and hazard index based on additivity [10] . Figure 1 illustrates each of the chemical mixture's WOE determination by a symbol indicating the direction of the interaction followed by the alphanumeric expression in Table 3 . The first two components are the major factors for ranking the quality of the mechanistic data to support the risk assessment.",

A genotoxic carcinogen alters the information coded in DNA; thus, it is reasonable to assume that these agents do not have a threshold so that a risk of cancer exists no matter how low the dose. There are three stages of genotoxic carcinogenesis: initiation, promotion, and progression. Initiation refers to the induction of an irreversible change in DNA caused by a mutagen. The initiator may be a direct-activating carcinogen or a carcinogenic metabolite. Promotion refers to the possibly reversible replication of initiated cells to form a \"benign\" lesion. Promoters are not genotoxic or carcinogenic but they enhance the tumorigenic response initiated by a primary or secondary carcinogen when administered at a later time. Complete carcinogens have initiation and promotion properties [ 4] . Nongenotoxic carcinogenesis does not involve direct interaction of a carcinogen with DNA. Mechanisms of nongenotoxic carcinogenesis include an accelerated replication that may increase the frequency of spontaneous mutations or increase the susceptibility of DNA damage. Cancer may be secondary to organ toxicity and may occur only at high dose rates. Moreover, many nongenotoxic cancer mechanisms are species-specific where the results from certain rodent species may not apply to human [4] .",

Exceptionally high quality >90 day oral exposure studies may be used as a basis for developing an RID whereas the inhalation route is preferred for deriving a RfC [15] . Please note that the same approaches used to develop the RID are used to develop the RfC, the only difference being the route of exposure, animal-to-human dosimetric adjustments, and the units, (i.e., mg/m 3 for the RfC vs mg/kg/day for the RID).",

However, if a NOAEL is not available, then the LOAEL can be used if a LOAEL to NOAEL uncertainty factor (UF) is applied. Significance generally refers to both biological and statistical criteria and is dependent on the number of dose levels tested, the number of animals tested at each dose, and the background incidence of the adverse response in the control groups [5] . NOAELs can be used as a basis for risk assessment calculations such as RIDs and acceptable daily intake values (ADI). ADI and RID values should be viewed as a conservative estimate of levels below which adverse affects would not be expected; exposures at doses greater than the ADI or RID are associated with an increase probability (but not certainty) of adverse effects [19] . WHO uses ADI values for pesticides and food additives to define \"the daily intake of chemical, which during an entire lifetime appears to be without appreciable risk on the basis of all known facts at that time\" [ 5] . In order to remove the value judgments implied by the words \"acceptable\" and \"safety\", the ADI and safety factor (SF) terms have been replaced with the terms RID and UP/modifying factors (MF), respectively.

For example, the common on-site pathways evaluated when conducting a RCRA remediation baseline risk assessment where unauthorized chemical releases have occurred includes direct contact with soil either by ingestion of soil and/ or inhalation of volatile chemicals or contaminated dust [ 19] . The migration of chemicals off-site can occur via wind-blown dust and vapor emissions from soil, leaching of chemicals to ground water with subsequent movement off-site, and run-off surface water. These off-site chemicals can eventually accumulate in other transport media such that the COPC ends up in vegetation crops, meat, milk, and fish that will eventually be consumed by humans. Therefore, pathways, sources of release, locations of contaminated media, fate and transport of COPCs, and location and activities of the potentially exposed population are explored. Exposure points and routes of exposure (ingestion, inhalation) are identified for each exposure pathway. It is necessary to identify populations likely to receive especially high exposure and populations likely to be unusually sensitive to the chemical's effects. An example of possible point of exposures and exposure routes due to exposure to ground water or surface water (i.e., source medium) used for drinking water is shown in Table 5 . Please note that all of these exposure path- Volatilization from water Air Inhalation into enclosed space ways are typically not evaluated when doing a risk assessment on contaminated drinking water since the techniques and exposure parameters for evaluating these routes of exposure are not well developed. Additional pathways to consider for surface water may include recreational exposures (i.e., swimming, boating), ingestion of contaminated fish, shellfish, etc., and dermal exposure to contaminated sediment.",

Exposure scenarios are a combination of\"exposure pathways\" to which a single \"receptor\" may be subjected [25] . For example, a residential adult or child receptor may be exposed to all the exposure routes in Table 5 (i.e., drinking water, showering/bathing, washing/cooking food, and volatilization from ground water or drinking water into an enclosed space). An industrial receptor may only be exposed through the drinking water pathway and volatilization from ground water into an enclosed space and not be exposed through showering/bathing or washing/ cooking, because these activities are not allowed at an industrial site. Exposure scenarios are generally conservative and not intended to be entirely representative of actual scenarios at all sites. The scenarios allow for standardized and reproducible evaluation of risks across most sites and land use areas [ 25] . Conservatism allows for protection of potential receptors not directly evaluated such as special subpopulations and regionally specific land uses.",

Off-site sampling and analysis are preferred methods to determine the exposure concentrations in the environmental media at the point of exposure. Because sampling data forms the foundation of a risk assessment, it is important that site investigation activities are designed and implemented with the overall goals of the risk assessment to be performed [19] . For example, it is essential that appropriate analytical methods with proper quality assurance/quality control documentation be employed and that the analytical methods are sensitive enough to detect the COPC at concentrations that are below health protective reference concentrations. After the sampling data is collected and evaluated, then statistical techniques may be used to calculate the representative concentration of COPCs that will be contacted over the exposure area. Different statistical techniques may be required for the determination of representative concentrations in ground water vs surface water [24] . Fate and transport models can be used to estimate current concentrations in media and/or at locations for which sampling was not conducted. In addition, an increase in future chemical concentrations in media that are currently contaminated or that may become contaminated can be predicted by fate and transport modeling. Detailed discussions of these models are contained elsewhere in this book.",

Science policy decisions that consider the best available data and risk management judgments regarding the population to be protected are both used to choose appropriate exposure parameters. USEPA emphasizes that exposure assessments should strive to achieve an overall dose estimate that represents a \"reasonable maximum exposure (RME):' The intent of the RME is to estimate a conservative exposure scenario that is within the range of possible exposures yet well above the average case (above the 90 1 h percentile of the actual distribution). However, estimates that are beyond the true distribution should be avoided. If near maximum or maximum values are chosen for each exposure parameter, then the combination of all maximum values for each exposure parameter would result in an unrealistic assessment of exposure. Using probabilistic risk assessment, Cullen demonstrated that if only two exposure parameters were chosen at maximum or near maximum values, and other parameters were chosen at medium values, than the risk and hazards estimates represented a RME (>99% percentile level) [31] . Risk assessors should identify the most sensitive parameters and use maximum or near-maximum values for one or a few of those variables. Central tendency or average values should be used for all other parameters [24] .",

However, probabilistic techniques like Monte Carlo analysis can be employed to provide different percentile estimates of risk and hazard (i.e., soth percentile or 95th percentile estimates) as well as to characterize variability and uncertainty in the risk assessment. Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique by which a quantity is calculated repeatedly, using randomly selected values from the entire frequency distribution for an exposure parameter or multiple exposure parameters for each calculation. USEPA recommends using computerized Monte Carlo simulations to provide probability distributions for dose and risk estimates by incorporating ranges for individual assumptions rather than a single dose or risk estimate [19] . Using better estimates for the distribution of contaminant levels is a major focus of recent risk assessment research. To obtain such estimates, several techniques, such as generating subjective uncertainty distributions and Monte Carlo composite analyses of parameter uncertainty, have been applied [5] . These are approaches that can provide a reality check that is useful in generating more realistic exposure estimates [ 5] . Also, high-end exposure estimates (HEEEs) and theoretical upper-bound estimates (TUBEs) are now recommended for specified populations as well as calculation of exposure for highly exposed individuals [5] . HEEE represents an estimate of the exposure in the upper ninetieth percentile while TUBEs represent exposure levels that exceed exposures experienced by all individuals in the exposure distribution and assume limits for all exposure variables [5] .

Ideally, chemicals would be grouped according to effect-specific toxicity criteria, information on chemicals exhibiting multiple effects would be available, and their exact mechanism of action would be known. Instead, RIDs and RfCs are available for just one of the several possible endpoints of toxicity for a chemical and data are often limited to gross toxicological effects in an organ or an entire organ system. The list of these specific endpoints of toxicity is limited so it is best to consult a toxicologist during this step of the hazard evaluation [16] . Each COPC and exposure pathway needs to be calculated to determine the actual risk. The HI provides a rough estimate of possible toxicity and requires careful interpretation [38] . The HI does not account for the number of individuals who might be affected by exposure or the severity of the effects. USEPA recommends that a HI of 1.0 be used for noncancer health effects. In the \"real world\", exposures generally involve complex mixtures of COPCs. There are three basic actions for mixtures: i) independent joint action, which describes COPCs that act independently and have different modes of action and are not expected to affect the toxicity of one another; ii) similar joint action or \"dose addition;' which describes a mixture where the COPCs produce similar but independent effects; iii) synergistic action, which the effective mixture cannot be assessed from the individual ingredients but depends on knowledge of their combined toxicity [39] (Table 3 and Fig. 1 ). The total HI can exceed the target hazard level as a result of the presence of either one or more COPCs with an HQ exceeding the target hazard level or the summation of several COPC-specific HQs that are each less than the target hazard level.",

Typical designated beneficial uses of water bodies include public water supply, propagation of fish and wildlife, recreation, agricultural water use, industrial water use and navigation. If information concerning COPCs is not present in the drinking water and/or state and tribal water standards databases, or additional exposure pathways need to be included during the site assessment, then media-specific comparison values are available from the Soil Screening Guidance [16] , several USEPA regional offices, and individual state governments (Table 6 ). These benchmark values may be used as a tool to perform initial site screenings or as initial cleanup goals, if applicable. The different media-specific comparison values are generic, but can be recalculated using more site-specific information and guidance provided on the applicable web addresses (Table 6 ). However, they usually do not consider all potential human health exposure pathways or consider ecological concerns. Many of the databases listed in Table 6 also provide COPC concentration in soil calculated with fate and transport models that are protective of ground water and surface water. If information concerning COPCs is not present in these databases, or additional exposure pathways need to be included during the site assessment, then a detailed toxicity evaluation and risk assessment may need to be conducted based on state or other regulatory agency guidelines.",

If there weren't any reported noncancer effects, then the MCLG was based on a nominal lifetime excess cancer risk of 10-6 to 10-5 , if data were adequate. The Office of Water is now moving toward guidance contained in the 1999 draft cancer guidelines [8, 43] which allows standards for nonlin-ear carcinogens to be derived based on low dose extrapolation and a mode of action approach.",

The amount of exposure attributed to each source compared to total exposure is called the relative source contribution (RSC) for that source. The RSC is typically set at 20% but if a site-specific assessment is conducted for a particular water body and it can be demonstrated that other sources of exposures are not likely to occur, then the RSC can be set as high as 80%.

For example, the National Recommended Water Quality Criteria table (http:/ /www.epa.gov/ost/standards/wqcriteria.html) lists freshwater or saltwater Criteria Maximum Concentration (CMC) criteria values that are the acute limits for the priority pollutant for the protection of aquatic life in freshwater or saltwater. The freshwater or saltwater Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) criteria value is the chronic limit for the priority pollutant for the protection of aquatic life in freshwater or saltwater, respectively. The table also includes criteria for organoleptic effects for 23 pollutants developed to prevent undesirable taste and/or odor imparted by them to ambient water. In some cases, a water quality criterion based on organoleptic effects or aquatic life protection would be more stringent than a criterion based on toxicologic endpoints.

The liquid crystal display (LCD), which contains benzene material for the liquid crystal, is also considered hazardous. In addition, the mercury switch, mercury relay, lithium battery, Ni-H battery, Ni-Cd battery, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) capacitor are all hazardous materials. Because of this, Taiwan has recently established guidelines for the proper disposal of computer and/or computer parts [54] . The nine guidelines are: i) landfill or incineration of scrap computers shall be avoided; ii) the phosphorescent coatings which have been applied to the glass panel of CRT must be removed; iii) ALL the batteries (Li, Ni-Cd,Ni-H) must be removed by non-destructive means; iv) all the PCB capacitors which have a diameter greater than 1 em and a height larger than 2 em must be removed; v) all the mercury containing parts must be removed; vi) CRT must be ventilated before stored inside a building; vii) the high-Ph content funnel glass of the CRT must be properly treated; viii) the LCD of notebook computer must be removed by non-destructive means; and lastly, ix) plastic that contains the flameretardant, bromine, shall be treated properly.

A core sample from one location of a site will definitely be different from a core sample from a different location of a site. Also, a core sample taken from the exact location at different times of day and/or different days will be different because weather, activity at the site, and composition of the waste can change and degrade or synthesize new compounds.

Even though such a mixture may never exist in reality, new insights may be gained to elucidate potential health effects from laboratory animals to human.

The negative results of this study were significant because various mixtures were tested at 10-to 100-fold or several orders of magnitude higher than potential human exposure levels [58] . Insights gained from Yang's project were: i) the effects will be subtle and marginal; ii) toxicologic interactions are possible at the environmentally realistic levels of exposure; iii) toxic responses may be from unconventional toxicologic end-point (immunosuppression, myelotoxicity); iv) possibility of subclinical residual effects may become more interactive with subsequent insults from chemical, physical, and/or biological agents; and v) negative results do not in-Toxity Evaluation and Human Health Risk Assessment of Surface and Ground Water 179 dicate safety for humans because the studies were done on rodents.
