EToV is the only torovirus that has been propagated in cell culture, in lines of equine dermis or embryonic mule skin cells, where it causes a cytopathic effect that results in cell lysis. While Berne virus was not neutralized by antisera against known equine viruses, serologic cross-reactions were observed in neutralization tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using sera from calves that had been experimentally infected with morphologically similar particles, then named \u2018Breda\u2019 viruses.",

After this initial report, other strains of BToV were identified in beef calves from Ohio, and in a colostrum-deprived (CD) calf from Iowa. Despite repeated attempts, BToV cannot be adapted to grow in cell or tissue cultures and must be passaged in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves, which has hampered its biochemical, biophysical, and molecular characterization. Most of the studies on the pathogenesis and pathology of torovirus infections have been done in BToV-infected Gn and CD calves, as well as in limited field studies; in contrast, most of the biochemistry and morphogenesis data on toroviruses are based on EToV studies.",

The term torus (Latin) refers to the circular convex molding in the form of a doughnut that some columns or pilaster have at their bases; indeed, it was the unique biconcave disk and C-shape of the virion in the extracellular environment that suggested this naming. Since 1992, the genus Torovirus has been included with the genus Coronavirus and the newly recognized genus Bafinivirus in the family Coronaviridae, based on similarities in genomic organization and replication strategies. Toro- and coronaviruses are also ancestrally related: their polymerase and envelope genes diverged from those of a common predecessor. Because of their inclusion in the family Coronaviridae, the nomenclature for coronavirus genes, mRNAs, and structural proteins have also been applied to toroviruses. However, the lack of sequence homology in the structural genes and the absence of antigenic relatedness with coronaviruses justify their taxonomic position as a separate genus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) presently recognizes four species in the genus Torovirus: Equine torovirus, Bovine torovirus, Porcine torovirus, and Human torovirus.",

Recently, the BToV genome has been completely sequenced, and it has been shown to comprise 28 475 nt and contain six ORFs (see Figure 1), each of which encodes a known protein. ORF1a and ORF1b are the most 5\u2032 proximal reading frames and constitute the replicase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene, which is expressed as a large precursor protein directly from the genomic RNA by a ribosomal frameshift mechanism, similar to other nidoviruses. The large product of these ORFs is apparently involved in the synthesis of a negative-strand RNA and the onset of genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis. The other four ORFs correspond to structural protein genes and are expressed by the production of a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set of four mRNAs. The BToV ORF2 (4752 nt), ORF3 (702 nt), ORF4 (1248\u20131251 nt), and ORF5 (504 nt) encode the spike (S), membrane (M), HE, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, respectively.",

Similar polypeptides of 20, 37, 85, and 105 kDa have been identified in purified BToV by means of surface radioiodination. The nucleocapsid (N) protein (167 aa) is the most abundant polypeptide found in the virion (80\u201384%) with a predicted molecular weight of 18.3\u201319.2 kDa. Blotting experiments performed with EToV have identified this internal protein as the only RNA-binding polypeptide in the virion. The M glycoprotein (233 aa, 26.5 kDa) is the second most abundant protein (\u223c13%) and is probably associated with the envelope. Computer analysis has revealed characteristics of a class III membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence, but containing three successive transmembrane \u03b1-helices in the N-terminal half. The M protein accumulates in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum and is believed to play a role in assembly, maturation, and nucleocapsid recognition during the budding process.",

EToV is remarkably stable in the environment, and relatively resistant to phospholipase C, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and even deoxycholate; however, Triton X-100 and organic solvents destroy its infectivity. EToV is stable within a wide range of pH, being inactivated only below pH 2.5 or above pH 10.3. BToV1 appears to be less stable than both EToV and BToV2 as changes in its sedimentation behavior and density have been observed after prolonged storage at \u201370 \u00b0C. The infectivity of a fecal preparation containing BToV1 has been reported to be lost completely after 3 weeks at 4 \u00b0C, whereas EToV in cell-free supernatant remained stable for 92 days. Storage of toroviruses at \u201320 to \u201370 \u00b0C helps to preserve infectivity. However, even at these temperatures the viruses will deteriorate, though at a slower rate.

EToV RNAs 1\u20133 are transcribed independently, as has been shown by UV transcription mapping.

At that time, tubular structures of variable length, diameter, and electron density appear in the cytoplasm, and also in the nucleus of infected cells, probably representing preformed nucleocapsids. It is unknown whether the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus reflects a nuclear phase in the replication of EToV or some sort of defective assembly. Viruses predominantly bud into the lumen of Golgi cisternae. The preformed nucleocapsid tubules approach the Golgi membrane with one of the rounded ends oriented toward the membrane and attach to it laterally. During budding, the nucleocapsid is apparently stabilized, leading to a higher electron density and a constant diameter (23 nm). Release into the intestinal lumen is probably through reverse pinocytosis. Virus maturation apparently occurs intracellularly during the egress process, where the virus nucleocapsid appearance changes from a straight rod (intracellular) into a torus shape (extracellular).

Oral inoculation of calves with BToV has been shown to induce diarrhea with virus shed in feces under experimental conditions. The nasal route is another possible pathway for entry as BToV antigen and viral RNA have been detected in the nasal secretions of feedlot calves. Additionally, diarrhea has been induced after intranasal inoculation in Gn and CD calves. For bovine coronavirus (BCoV), respiratory tract infections have been reported to occur prior to enteric infections, indicating the possible importance of this route of transmission in the spread and pathogenesis of this distantly related group of enteric nidoviruses. It is possible that BToV, like BCoV, could initially replicate in nasal epithelial cells, and thereby amplify before being swallowed and infecting the intestinal tract. This hypothesis for BToV pathogenesis should be further studied.",

Twenty-four to seventy-two hours post exposure, the first clinical signs are observed (mild fever, depression, weakness, and anorexia), followed by a greenish-yellow to bright yellow watery diarrhea that lasts for 3\u20135 days. Calves may develop severe dehydration and die. Fecal virus shedding begins 24\u201372 h post infection, coinciding with the onset of diarrhea, and lasts for 2\u20136 days. Shedding peaks around 3\u20134 days post infection. Mixed infections with other enteric viruses, such as rotaviruses or astroviruses, result in a more severe watery diarrhea than is induced by either virus alone. In CD calves with a normal intestinal flora, diarrhea is generally more severe than in Gn calves. Sporadic and recurrent shedding of BToV can last for up to 4 months. BToV has also been detected in nasal samples. Further studies are needed to analyze BToV replication and shedding in the respiratory tract as well as its role in respiratory pathologies.",

Affected children showed watery diarrhea, vomiting three to four times daily, and dehydration as a consequence; neither fever, nor the presence of other enteric pathogens, was recorded.

As shown by IF, both crypt and villus epithelial cells contain antigen. The watery diarrhea is probably a result of the loss of reabsorptive capacity of the colonic mucosa, combined with malabsorption in the small intestine. The germinal centers of Peyer's patches are depleted of lymphocytes and may occasionally show fresh hemorrhage. The dome epithelial cells, including the M-cells, display the same cytopathic changes as seen in the absorptive cells of the villi. Virions are found in cells of both the small and large intestine, and between enterocytes at the basal and lateral plasma membranes. In macrophages of the lamina propria, virions in various stages of degradation are found.",
