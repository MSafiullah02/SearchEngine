Their small size (approximately 2- to 60-fold smaller than a standard Gram-positive staphylococcus or streptococcus bacterium) gave viruses the distinct property of being able to pass through the conventional filters of the day, allowing their identification as \u201cfilterable agents.\u201d Today viruses have been identified that affect every kingdom\u2014animals, plants, and bacteria. These ubiquitous agents therefore have the potential to influence the entire biota of the planet. While this chapter will focus on human viruses, the general principles discussed can be applied to other virus families.",

A conventional virus is made up of two or three major components. A nucleic acid genome, which can be DNA or RNA (single- or double-stranded, contiguous or segmented) contains all of the genetic information and is responsible for encoding all of the virus-specific macromolecules of the pathogen. Due to the aggressive application of molecular biological techniques, the sequences of many viruses are known and fully annotated. This nucleic acid genome is packaged in a protein shell called a capsid. The capsid proteins generally self-assemble to form the shell, which takes on an icosahedral, helical, or complex symmetry depending on the virus family. The functions of this capsid include packaging of the genome, protecting the genome from environmental insults, and effectively delivering the nucleic acid to the inside of living cells. Most RNA viruses and some DNA viruses are surrounded by a lipid envelope that is derived from the host cell. The membranes of enveloped viruses all contain viral-specific glycoproteins that aid in viral tropism.",

            "text": "There are eight basic steps in a viral infection of a eukaryotic cell. The first is adsorption of the virion to the cell surface through an interaction of viral proteins with specific cellular receptors and, in some cases, coreceptor molecules. Viruses can specifically and tightly interact with proteins (e.g., HIV and CD4), carbohydrates (e.g., influenza virus and sialic acid), and lipids (e.g., B19 parvovirus and globoside). This virus-receptor interaction in large part determines the tropism of many viruses. Preventing this interaction is the goal of neutralizing antibodies that are generated by the immune system. The second step is viral penetration of the cell surface. This can be done by direct membrane fusion or endocytosis. The third step is uncoating of the viral genome inside the cell. In many cases, uncoating is due to pH changes that occur inside endocytotic vesicles that result in structural rearrangements of viral surface proteins. The fourth step is primary transcription/gene expression. Many viruses are designed to actively express their genomes immediately upon uncoating. This is accomplished via several strategies, including the packaging of viral polymerases, packaging or production of strong transcriptional transactivation proteins, and the simple fact that some viral genomes can serve directly as mRNAs. Step five is replication of the viral genome. Since viral-encoded proteins play a key role in this step for many viruses, this step has been a prime target for the development of antivirals. The next step is called \u201csecondary transcription,\u201d or gene expression that occurs off of progeny genomes. This is an important step that viruses use to amplify their gene expression to obtain maximal yields of viral progeny. It should also be noted that many viruses make different sets of proteins at early and late times postinfection. Early proteins generally include replication and transcription factors as well as proteins that allow the virus to usurp cellular metabolism. Late protein production focuses on virion structural components. The seventh step is the packaging of progeny viral genomes. Viral capsids in most cases self-assemble, and the genomic nucleic acid must be properly inserted. The final step is the release of progeny virions from the cell. For enveloped viruses, this involves budding and the acquisition of a lipid bilayer membrane.",

            "text": "There are several ways to determine whether a cell is infected with a virus. First, many viral infections elicit cytopathic effects such as the rounding of cells, shrinkage, aggregation, lysis, or cell-cell fusion. These effects are due in large part to the expression of specific viral proteins or the shut-down of host cell macromolecular synthesis that occurs during the infection. Second, focal points of viral replication and assembly can sometimes be observed. These are referred to as inclusion bodies; a classic example is the detection of Negri bodies (cytoplasmic acidophilic inclusion bodies) in rabies virus-infected samples. Third, viral proteins expressed on the surface of an infected cell can sometimes bind many red blood cells, a phenomenon called \u201chemadsorption\u201d that can be very striking when observed in a light microscope. This technique can be very useful if a viral infection shows very little cytopathic effect. The fourth way to directly detect viral-specific gene products is through the use of antibodies in western blots, immunofluorescence, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Finally, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with virus-specific primers can be used to directly identify viral-infected tissue. The use of PCR-based assays as a powerful molecular epidemiologic tool is discussed further below.",

Physical methods such as particle counts using an electron microscope, hemaglutination assays, and ELISAs/(RIAs) can provide an approximation of the total number of viral particles in a sample, but do not address the fact that for many viruses, the particle-to-biologically active particle ratio is rather low. Therefore biological assays that include serial dilutions in conjunction with plaque assays, focus-forming assays, or determination of the infectious dose needed to kill 50% of a target laboratory animal test group are often considered the gold standard.",

            "text": "There are several key definitions and unique aspects of viral genetics that should be stressed. First, a field or street isolate of a virus is obtained directly from the natural host. Viruses that are passaged in cell culture often adapt to growth under in vitro conditions and may lose or gain some properties relative to the field isolate. Second, co-infection with two or more viruses that contain a segmented genome can result in a reassortment of segments in the progeny virions. This can result in dramatic changes in the biologic and/or antigenic properties of the new viruses. Third, while DNA viruses have a mutation rate of 10\u22128 to 10\u221211 per nucleotide incorporated, RNA viruses have a million-fold greater mutation rate (10\u22123 to 10\u22124). This is due to the presence of error-prone polymerases that lack the ability to proofread. Fourth, phenotypic mixing or pseudotype formation can occur in an infection by two different viruses when progeny viruses are produced that contain the capsid of virus \u201cA\u201d surrounding the nucleic acid genome of virus \u201cB.\u201d In other words, phenotypic mixing is the mixing of nonnucleic acid components between two viruses. Finally, many viruses generate defective progeny viruses as a normal part of their life cycle. While this is one reason for the low particle-to-plaque-forming-unit ratios that are observed in viral preparations, the production of defective particles can have biological consequences as well. It is well established for several RNA viruses that defective particles are naturally produced that interfere with the replication of the wild-type virus. These defective interfering particles moderate the course of an infection and can support the establishment of persistent infections.",

The three main types of vaccines currently in use are killed (i.e., formalin-fixed viruses), live attenuated vaccine strains, and subunit vaccines made from recombinant proteins. Additional types of vaccines, including DNA-based vaccines and use of single vectors for broad vaccination, may well be on the horizon.",

However due to advances in molecular virology and rational drug design, the arsenal of antiviral compounds is growing quickly. The prime targets of available antivirals include uncoating (e.g., amantadine prevents intraviral pH changes in influenza virions), viral polymerases to prevent replication (e.g., AZT, ribavirin, and acyclovir), viral proteases to prevent maturation of virions, neuraminidases to prevent viral release from cells, and cellular enzymes involved in protein synthesis (interferons). The application of antibodies for the treatment or prevention of viral diseases is also becoming more common. In summary, the antiviral arena is definitely an evolving field.",

The key human pathogenic parvovirus is called B19, which specifically infects red blood cell precursor cells via the P antigen as its receptor. This results in a transient, usually subclinical anemia that can be rather severe in hemolytic anemia patients (i.e., sickle cell disease) or the immune-compromised. Several weeks later, an immune-mediated rash (erythema infectiosum or fifth disease) or arthritis-like symptoms develop. Another parvovirus that is worth mentioning due to its utility in gene therapy is adeno-associated virus (AAV). As its name implies, the virus is dependent on co-infection with another DNA virus for efficient replication. Due to the facts that AAV causes no recognized human disease and integrates at a predominant location in the cellular genome, it is currently under development as a means of therapeutic gene delivery to human cells. In addition to therapeutic uses, the possibility clearly exists that AAV can be engineered as a biowarfare agent as well (i.e., potent toxin genes can be inserted into its genome and effectively delivered to human cells).",

Individuals will maintain herpesvirus infections in a latent form following the initial acute infection. Reactivation can occur under a variety of circumstances. Herpes simplex viruses type I and II cause ulcerative lesions of the skin and remain latent in nerve ganglia. Cold sores are due to herpes simplex virus reactivation from the trigeminal ganglia. Varicella zoster virus causes chicken pox during primary infection and zoster or shingles upon reactivation. Human cytomegalovirus is a major cause of congenital infections that result in a variety of symptoms including retardation and hearing loss. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) targets B cells and causes infectious mononucleosis in young adults. In addition, EBV infection is associated with cancers in some populations (Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Asia). Human herpes virus type 6 causes the common childhood rash roseola (exanthem subitum). HHV8 or Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpes Virus is a sexually transmitted agent that causes kaposi lesions in the immunosuppressed. In addition to vaccines for VZV, herpesvirus infections can be controlled by a highly effective antiviral acyclovir and its derivatives. The drug specifically targets the viral thymidine kinase gene and prevents replication during active infections. The widespread nature of most herpesviruses makes suspicious outbreaks less likely. It should be noted, however, that due to the sexually transmitted nature of HHV8, kaposi sarcoma was one of the defining lesions on homosexual AIDS patients noted early on in the HIV epidemic.",

These agents have a single large open reading frame that encodes a single large polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved in an ordered fashion by proteases to generate individual functional polypeptides. Cap-independent translation was discovered in picornaviral internal ribosome entry site elements located in the 5\u2032 noncoding region of the genome. Togaviruses, astroviruses, and caliciviruses generate two or more individual polyproteins that are encoded by the genome, as well as subgenomic mRNAs that are generated during infection.

Select members of the 30+ serotypes of echoviruses are among the most commonly isolated viruses from stools, and cause a variety of disease symptoms including meningitis, encephalitis, rashes, diarrhea, upper respiratory infections, and conjunctivitis. Coxsackieviruses (29 serotypes) are also rather commonly isolated from humans and cause hand, foot, and mouth disease (which is distinct from the animal virus that wreaked havoc on British livestock in 2000), herpangina, pleurodynia, and myocarditis in addition to a variety of nonspecific symptoms. Hepatitis A virus, the agent that causes acute infectious hepatitis, is also a member of the picornavirus family. The final branch of the human picornavirus family tree, rhinovirus, contains over 100 serotypes and causes the common cold. The biology of rhinoviruses is unique from other picornaviruses in that the virions are not stable to low pH, and the agent prefers growing at lower temperatures (33\u00b0C vs. 37\u00b0C).

There are three general factors that govern gene expression in these viruses. First, the viral polymerase initiates transcription only at one end of the viral genome and reinitiates with approximately 50% efficiency following termination at the end of each gene. This property makes gene order an important means by which the relative levels of proteins are regulated. Second, the decision by the polymerase whether to transcribe mRNAs or replicate the entire genome is determined by the relative levels of the viral nucleocapsid protein. If levels are sufficient to package the nascent transcript, the polymerase ignores termination signals and proceeds copying the RNA template. Finally, cotranscriptional editing\u2014the insertion of additional uncoded nucleotides by the viral polymerase\u2014occurs at a select homopolymer run in all paramyxovirus genomes. This property is probably related to the tendency of the polymerase to stutter on poly(U) stretches to generate the poly(A) tail. In addition to the natural human viruses outlined below, it should also be noted that the technology to create recombinant negative-sense viruses has been developed.",

            "text": "The four families of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses contain several classical and emerging human viruses of notoriety. The first family, the Paramyxoviridae, contains four major human viruses that all initiate infection in the upper respiratory tract. Measles and mumps viruses cause once-common childhood maladies (fever/rash and parotitis syndromes, respectively) that are preventable by live attenuated vaccines given as part of the MMR series. The four serotypes of human parainfluenza virus are responsible for numerous seasonal respiratory infections in children, most notably croup. The last member of the paramyxoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, is the number one respiratory pathogen for children in terms of disease severity. No vaccine is currently available to prevent infection by the last two members of the paramyxoviruses. Prophylactic doses of anti-RSV IgG is currently being given to reduce to the risk of respiratory syncytial virus infection in highly susceptible groups of children. The major member of the next family, the Rhabdoviridae, is rabies virus. This bullet-shaped virion is usually acquired through the bite of a rabid animal (most notably bats in recent years). Following replication at the site of infection, the virus travels to the CNS, where it invariably results in death. Because of the protracted time it takes for the virus to cross the neuromuscular junction to infect the nervous system, this is the only viral infection where post-exposure immunization is helpful. The Ebola virus is the prototypic member of the third family of negative-sense RNA viruses, the Filoviridae. As its name implies, this family consists of viruses with elongated nucleocapsids. Ebola causes outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever that is often fatal. Although the disease has not been seen in the U.S., several individuals in Reston, Virginia were infected by an Ebola strain with reduced virulence that was carried in a primate laboratory animal shipment. The bornaviridae make up the final family of this group. These viruses are unique among the negative-sense RNA viruses in that they replicate in the nucleus in order to utilize the cellular splicing machinery. It has been suggested that bornaviruses play a role in several neural pathologies, but their exact contribution to human disease is still being explored.",

            "text": "There are four families of human pathogenic RNA viruses that contain genomes consisting of two or more unique segments of nucleic acid. These genomes can take the form of negative-sense, ambisense, or double-stranded RNA. A key feature of these viruses is the rapid evolution that can occur due to reassortment of genomic segments in the progeny of infections by multiple viral species in the same cell. This is the reason that epidemiologists follow influenza virus very closely to insure that the current vaccine will provide coverage to any new variants that have recently emerged. One interesting molecular property of all of the single-stranded families in this group is that they \u201csteal\u201d the 5\u2032 caps from cellular mRNAs to form the 5\u2032 end of their own transcripts.",

The Orthomyxoviridae consist of the enveloped negative-sense RNA viruses that cause influenza. Influenza A has eight segments. As noted above, due to reassortment, the nature of the two major surface antigens, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are closely monitored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in new influenza virus isolates. In addition to the killed influenza vaccine, infections can also be treated by antivirals that block uncoating (amantadine) and neuraminidase function. The Bunyaviridae family contains many arthropod-borne agents that cause fevers and encephalitis. These viruses have three genomic RNA segments that may be negative- or ambisense. In addition to these viruses, the rodent-borne hantavirus which emerged in the southwestern U.S. in 1993, causing numerous cases of severe pulmonary syndrome, is also a bunyavirus. The rodent-borne arenaviruses contain two ambisense genomic RNA segments and generally cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans (e.g., Lassa fever virus). The human members of the Reoviridae consist of 10\u201312 double-stranded RNA segments packaged in a double-walled protein shell. These viruses never fully uncoat their genome during infection, which helps avoid the action of double-strand activated enzymes of the interferon response. The major example of a human Reoviridae member is the common childhood diarrhea agent rotavirus. Over 80% of children in the U.S. will suffer diarrhea and vomiting due to infection by this agent.",

The main examples of human retroviruses are the agent responsible for human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS: HIV) and human T-cell leukemia virus. Both of these agents are complex retroviruses that contain several regulatory genes (i.e., tat and rev) in addition to the gag, pol, and env genes of conventional retroviruses.",

The advent of rapid sequencing techniques has opened the door to obtaining detailed fingerprints of viruses that could provide important clues as to their source. In general, a selected region of the viral genome is sequenced from numerous isolates and subjected to comparative phylogenetic analysis.

Due to their small size and high rate of evolution, several considerations should be kept in mind when applying comparative molecular forensic analyses to viruses. First, for statistical reasons, it is usually advisable to look at as large a number of regions with variable sequence content as possible in the viruses that are isolated. Cost constraints, however, often make this impractical. Many viral genes, especially in RNA viruses, contain regions under rapid evolution and others that are under significant evolutionary constraint. In choosing a region of the viral genome to focus the analysis upon, it is important to consider that only rapidly evolving regions will provide enough useful variability when comparing agents from recently acquired infections. Second, if possible, it is extremely useful to include in the analysis a significant number of control viruses isolated from the surrounding population. This will allow for a full consideration of the background viruses in the local environment, and allow for a stronger statistical argument for relatedness to a predicted infection source. Finally, the overall strength of the argument for relatedness between two viruses requires detailed phylogenetic and statistical analyses that consider all alternative hypotheses. It will be important to get as close to \u201c100%\u201d certainty when one is performing the analysis for use in a legal rather than scientific context.",

The sequencing of the env gene from viruses isolated from the doctor and patients strongly corroborated the epidemiological data that suggested the transmission route.1 In more recent cases, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the HIV genes followed by phylogenetic analyses have been used to suggest HIV transmission from a surgeon to a patient2 and from a nurse to a patient.3 Molecular forensics has been applied to other viral infections in addition to HIV. The nosocomial spread of specific strains of hepatitis C virus infections in hemodialysis units, for example, has been documented in several instances.4,\n5\n",
