Although both emerged from the SARS coronavirus, suggesting the newly spread 2019-nCov into human is very much related to SARS-CoV (Kumar et al. 2020). Figure 13.2 represents the evolutionary relationship between different lineage of betacoronavirus and their respective cellular receptors through which they interact with the host cell. As per sequence alignment data, the sequence of spike glycoprotein of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV shows 76.2% individuality, 87.2% resemblance, and 2% gaps. This data indicates that COVID-19 spike glycoprotein exhibits higher sequence similarity with 12.8% of variation with SARS-CoV. The study performed by Kumar et al. (2020), on variation of sequences of minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD), revealed 73.3% uniqueness, 83.9% matches, and 0.4% gaps, suggesting a difference of 16.1% and tertiary structure of minimal receptor-binding domain. COVID-19 may have changes in virus-binding capacity shift and infectivity into the receptors of the host cell, due to notable deviation in minimal RBD of S-glycoprotein.\n",

            "text": "The viruses belong to Coronaviridae family enclosed envelope and positive-stranded RNA (Li et al. 2020). Coronaviruses have the largest 26\u201332 kilobase (kb) positive-sense RNA genome. The genome of coronaviruses contains open reading frames (ORFs) of variable number (6\u201311). In the first ORF, two thirds of the total viral RNA are located. Upon infection, two large precursor polyproteins, namely pp1a and pp1ab, has been translated by viral genome in the host cells. These translated precursor polyproteins get processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp1\u2013nsp16) by viral proteinases. These nonstructural proteins have been numbered according to the position from N to C terminus (Kumar et al. 2020; Narayanan et al. 2014). Figure 13.3 depicts the structure of coronavirus representing essential proteins, accessory proteins, and nsp1\u201316. The remaining ORFs encode accessory proteins. The remaining part of viral genome encodes spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid protein (N). All these four are essential structural proteins. S protein is attached to the host receptor ACE2, including two subunits S1 and S2. The cellular tropism by RBD and virus host range is determined by S1. Virus cell membrane fusion is determined by S2 (Guo et al. 2020; Pradhan et al. 2020; Belouzard et al. 2009; Du et al. 2009). Transmembrane nutrient transport and formation of envelop were performed by M protein. N protein and E protein along with several accessory proteins obstruct with host immune response (Guo et al. 2020; Pradhan et al. 2020). The nonstructural proteins play a vital function at the time of viral RNA replication and transcription (Kumar et al. 2020; Narayanan et al. 2014). The assigned functions of these 16 mature nonstructural proteins are mentioned in Table 13.2. Several nsps are unique enzymes implicated in one or more important step(s) in viral replication. Other nsps appear to be entirely involved in virus\u2013host interactions (De Groot et al. 2012).\n\n",

In COVID-19, some epitopes are identified with difference in single amino acid change. As per available information and research data of antigenicity, COVID-19 shows little antigenic similarities with SARS coronavirus. It is possible that antigenic similarity may cause similar antigenic response, and therefore, it can be used as one of the precautionary approach.

On the whole 12.5% of difference in sequences of S glycoprotein and difference in minimal RBD with 23.6% may cause structural differences in spike glycoproteins of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV (Kumar et al. 2020). The studies performed to measure the average distance between the molecules of superimposed proteins, i.e., RMSD, depict the 1.38 \u00c5 local RMSD value between two glycoproteins. This illustrates regardless of 12.8% sequence variation that there is an insignificant structural divergence among the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and COVID-19. The absence of structural divergence in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and COVID-19 raises a hope for the treatment of brutal COVID-19. As there is structural similarity in SARS-CoV and COVID-19, the previously trialed and tested attachment inhibitor used for SARS-CoV can be used as the present choice of treatment for COVID-19 (Kumar et al. 2020).",

SARS-CoV is becoming pandemic which is declared as public health emergency of global concern. The presence of novel glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV-2 makes it possible to become pandemic due to its antigenic divergence. At this time, it is important to understand and educate the mass to follow the instructions given by the authorities and avoid any social gathering. By this at least we can delay the transmission in widespread community. Slowdown of transmission rate will provide time to the researchers and scientists to prepare well and develop vaccine and treatment for this novel coronavirus. The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV in terms of antigenic sites proposes the scope of SARS-linked peptide-based vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The structural similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV suggests the use of attachment inhibitor, specific to coronavirus as the current option of the treatment. Although the mechanism of species to species transfer of the SARS coronavirus is difficult to understand, SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic makes it clear that animal coronaviruses are budding threats to the human community.
