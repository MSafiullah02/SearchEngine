            "text": "West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging, mosquito-borne human pathogen that first appeared in the U.S. in 1999 (Brinton, 2002) and currently constitutes a serious health threat, with 264 registered deaths and 9858 reported cases in 2003 (CDC, 2004). Sporadic outbreaks have also occurred in Europe, and the virus has been isolated from birds in the UK (Buckley et al., 2003). Typical symptoms of WNV infection include fever, rashes, and myalgia; however, occasionally more severe and potentially fatal symptoms develop, including acute encephalitis and fulminant hepatitis (Petersen et al., 2003). WNV are divided into two lineages: lineage 1 includes the New York strain (NY99) responsible for the recent outbreaks in the U.S., as well as the closely related Kunjin virus, which was recently classified as an Australian subtype of WNV Lanciotti et al. 1999, Scherret et al. 2001. Unlike the highly pathogenic NY99 strain, humans infected with Kunjin virus do not develop the more severe symptoms (Hall et al., 2003). Lineage 2 consists of several African strains, which are apparently not involved in outbreaks of the disease (Lanciotti et al., 1999). There is currently no vaccine available, but inoculation with a cDNA for the whole genome of an attenuated form of Kunjin virus could confer resistance to infection by the NY99 strain of WNV in mice (Hall et al., 2003).",

The flaviviruses have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, containing one large open reading frame, which is translated as a single polyprotein (Lindenbach and Rice, 2002). The 3433 amino acid polyprotein of WNV is cleaved by host and viral proteases to the three structural proteins, C (core), prM (membrane), and E (envelope), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins (Brinton, 2002). In the virion, the genome is contained within a spherical or isometric nucleocapsid or core made from the C protein. The 123 amino acid C precursor is targeted to the membrane by a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic sequence and is cleaved to its mature 105 residue form by the viral NS2B-NS3 protease. The core is surrounded by a lipid membrane containing the two membrane proteins prM and E (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003). Particle maturation involves cleavage of pre-M to M and resulting reorganization of the E proteins from a dimeric to a trimeric arrangement Kuhn et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2003.",

Consequently, the WNV E protein is presumed to have a similar structure to the E protein of dengue virus and TBE Modis et al. 2003, Rey et al. 1995.

Dengue virus C protein shares about 57% identity with WNV. The WNV C protein contains a large number of positively charged residues, which are distributed throughout the protein, unlike the core proteins of togaviruses and arteriviruses, which have distinct, positively charged N-terminal regions Choi et al. 1991, Doan and Dokland 2003. The N-terminal and C-terminal charged regions have both been implicated in RNA binding (Khromykh and Westaway, 1996). The dengue virus C protein was recently solved by NMR methods (Ma et al., 2004). It forms a dimer in solution and contains four \u03b1 helices. The N-terminal 20 or so residues were disordered, similar to the RNA binding regions of togaviruses and arteriviruses. Here, we report the crystal structure of the C protein from the Kunjin subtype of WNV. This is the first crystal structure of a flavivirus core protein. The C protein forms dimers, similar to those of dengue virus C, which are organized into tetramers with highly positively charged surfaces. The \u03b1 helices in the tetramers stack up to form long filamentous ribbons in the crystal.",

Crystals of the full-length C protein were unstable and disordered and did not diffract X-rays to high resolution. Assuming that the crystal disorder was caused by flexible regions in the protein, we treated the full-length protein with trypsin, resulting in a stable fragment starting at Val23 and ending at Arg98 (Figure 1). This fragment yielded stable crystals which diffracted synchrotron radiation anisotropically to about 2.8 \u00c5 resolution.

Like the WNV C protein, both of these proteins are involved in nucleic acid interactions; however, unlike WNV C, they are monomeric.

Two such tetramers, rotated by 58\u00b0 around an axis parallel to the crystal a axis, comprise the asymmetric unit of the crystal (Figure 3C). In the crystal, symmetry-related tetramers form long, helical ribbons that spiral around the 4-fold screw axes and extend the length of the crystal c axis (Figure 3C). Two such ribbons together form a hollow tubule at each of the two 4-fold screw axes in the crystal. This leaves a large space between adjacent tubules, which is reflected in the relatively high solvent content (57%). Interestingly, the resulting repeated stacking of \u03b1 helices in the tubules resembles the long, filamentous structures commonly formed by HEAT and ARM repeat proteins, multimeric structures typically involved in protein-protein interactions (Andrade et al., 2001).",

The symmetry related C\u2032D\u2032 dimer approaches the pocket, so that the \u03b11 helices from A, C\u2032, and D\u2032 form a trimeric bundle. This would cause helix \u03b11 from B and C\u2032 to overlap; consequently, density for \u03b11 in subunit B is missing, suggesting that this helix undergoes an order-disorder transition upon crystallization. Such order-disorder transitions are often of functional importance and may suggest a role in the conformational switching that is required during core assembly (Dokland, 2000). The density is very poor for the overlapping \u03b1 helices in subunit C, perhaps due to two alternative orientations coexisting in the crystal. The GH dimer forms similar interactions with E\u2032F\u2032; in this case \u03b11 is missing from H where it would overlap with F\u2032. The different orientation of \u03b11 in the dengue C protein (Ma et al., 2004) also suggests that this helix is flexible, perhaps reflecting a functional role in assembly or RNA binding (Figure 2D). The hydrophobic pocket contains additional density that was not interpretable at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution, but could conceivably represent part of the missing density for the B and H subunits, or perhaps a polyethylene glycol molecule from the crystallization solution. There is a cation, probably Ca2+, sitting on the crystallographic 2-fold axis between 2-fold related Thr43 residues and an anion, possibly Cl\u2212, held between 2-fold related Arg31residues, about 9.5 \u00c5 from the cation, mediating the interactions between tubules in adjacent asymmetric units. The two ribbons within the tubule are held together by interactions between Arg69 residues in the A\u2013G and B\u2013E chains.",

            "text": "The WNV C protein dimer presumably represents the building block for core assembly, which also involves interactions with the viral RNA. Both the N-terminal (1\u201332) and C-terminal (83\u2013103) sequences of the Kunjin virus C protein are involved in RNA binding (Khromykh and Westaway, 1996). The N-terminal region corresponds to the disordered region (residues 1\u201322) that was cleaved off by the trypsin treatment, and the C-terminal region corresponds to helix \u03b14, which forms an 11 \u00c5 wide tunnel in the tetramer (Figure 3B). The tunnel contains a number of positively charged residues, consistent with a role in RNA binding (Figure 4B). The N- and C-terminal RNA binding regions are located at opposite ends of the dimer. While a conformational switch in the N-terminal region, perhaps reflected in the order-disorder transition in helix \u03b11, could bring the two termini together on one side, the organization would appear to be very different from that of the togaviruses or the arteriviruses, which have a clear \u201cinside\u201d or RNA binding face Choi et al. 1991, Doan and Dokland 2003. It is possible that the RNA instead associates on the surface of the C tetramer, in a way similar to that proposed for the tetrameric Borna virus nucleoprotein (Rudolph et al., 2003). Indeed, the C tetramer has a strongly positively charged surface (Figure 4B). In this model, the tetramers would form the building blocks for capsid assembly. The order-disorder transition in helix \u03b11 (Figure 4A) might thus reflect tetramer-tetramer interactions in the nucleocapsid. However, the lack of a structured core in EM reconstructions of dengue or WNV could mean that there is no ordered shell, and that the RNA is instead packed together with protein in a nonspecific manner Kuhn et al. 2002, Mukhopadhyay et al. 2003, Zhang et al. 2003.",

In the C structure, this region forms the hydrophobic pocket that is partially protected by helix \u03b11. Movement of \u03b11 might render the hydrophobic region in a position able to interact with the membrane. Part of the hydrophobic region of TBE C (residues 28\u201343), which corresponds to parts of helices \u03b11 and \u03b12 in WNV, could be removed while still retaining some viability (Kofler et al., 2002). This suggests that the RNA binding properties of the C-terminal domain are more important than the specific fold of the protein, or that RNA binding is more unspecific in nature. Furthermore, viability was partially restored by mutations that increased the hydrophobic nature of the remaining sequence, indicating that membrane localization is done through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions (Kofler et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Based on differences in genomic organization as well as homologies in nonstructural proteins, the Flaviviridae are considered to belong to an evolutionarily distinct superfamily from Togaviridae and the Nidovirales, which includes coronaviruses and arteriviruses (Strauss and Strauss, 2002). Indeed, the structures of the core proteins from these three superfamilies are different. The Sindbis virus (Togaviridae) core protein has a chymotrypsin-like \u03b2-barrel fold (Choi et al., 1991). The recently determined structure of the core (N) protein of the arterivirus PRRSV displayed a novel motif based on an antiparallel \u03b2 sheet flanked by \u03b1 helices (Doan and Dokland, 2003). As already suspected from analysis of charge distribution and secondary structure predictions, the flavivirus core structure presented here has a different structure, based entirely on \u03b1-helical bundles. Yet, there are some similarities between the WNV C and PRRSV N structures: Both proteins are dimeric; the dimers have an antiparallel \u03b1 helix pair and are flanked by connecting \u03b1 helices; both structures form long filamentous ribbon-like or tubular structures that extend in the direction of the long crystal c axis. In WNV, these filaments are formed by stacking of \u03b1-helical domains (Figure 3C), similar to those formed by HEAT repeat proteins (Andrade et al., 2001). These similarities are probably based on similar propensities or requirements for forming multimeric shells with a range of different interactions, and may reflect subunit and RNA interactions in the virus.",

The protein was treated with low concentrations of trypsin, resulting in a stable 10.5 kDa fragment. N-terminal protein sequencing and mass spectrometry confirmed that the fragment started from Val23 and ended at Arg98. This 76 residue fragment was crystallized by vapor diffusion against 0.5%\u20132% PEG 3350 at pH 10.5 and yielded stable crystals of up to 0.2 mm length, which diffracted synchrotron radiation anisotropically to about 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. Se-Met derivative crystals were made by the same procedure by growing the cells in M9 minimal media supplemented with amino acids Lys, Phe, Thr, Ile, Leu, Val, and Se-Met and 0.4% glucose (Doublie, 1997).",

The crystals belonged to space group I41 with a = 85.7 \u00c5 and c = 214.4 \u00c5, corresponding to a total of eight protein monomers in the asymmetric unit with VM = 2.8. Structure determination by Se-Met MAD methods was done using SOLVE and RESOLVE Terwilliger 2002, Terwilliger 2003. Starting from the initial RESOLVE trace, the noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) that resulted in the generation of a total of four dimers in the asymmetric unit was identified and used for 8-fold NCS averaging and map improvement with DM (Cowtan and Main, 1998), as well as phase extension to 3.2 \u00c5 resolution using the native data. All eight subunits were built manually into the 2Fo \u2212 Fc map using the program O (Jones et al., 1991), and the sequence could be unambiguously assigned in residues 24\u201396 in most of the chains (Figure 2A). Density for residues 24\u201339 was missing in two chains, and was poor for another two chains.
