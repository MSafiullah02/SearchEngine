            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 ultimately led to 8000 people becoming infected, 916 of whom died. The causative agent was identified as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(1,2). Even though the epidemic ended, the threat of reemergence persists, compounded by the absence of an established vaccine. One of the critical issues in controlling a pandemic is a system for early diagnosis that distinguishes SARS from other types of pulmonary infections. Based on clinical experience, several options have been considered in the quest to develop the capacity to accurately diagnose SARS-CoV infection, including molecular biology techniques and serological tests such as antigen-capture ELISA assay and immunofluorescence assay to detect virus-infected cells in respiratory swabs(3\u20137). The preparation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is considered to be especially valuable for serological testing. Here we describe a method for the successful establishment and characterization of mAbs against SARS-CoV structural components. These mAbs enable the general immunological detection of SARS-CoV by methods such as immunofluorescent staining, immunoblotting, and immunohistology, in addition to the construction of a highly sensitive antigen-capture sandwich ELISA(6).",

The PEG solution is kept at 37\u00b0C for at least 1 h.One or two spleens from mice are excised and the spleen cell suspension is prepared by passing through a sterile stainless mesh or by smashing with two slide glasses. The cells are washed by centrifugation (270 \u00d7g for 5 min) twice with 5% FCS/RPMI and once with RPMI.The log-phase growing Sp2/O-Ag14 myeloma cells are washed twice with 5% FCS/RPMI and once with RPMI.Count the cells and mix them to a ratio of splenocyte:Sp2/O-Ag14 = 3:1. Spin the cells down and remove the supernatant thoroughly.Add 0.5 ml PEG/RPMI solution to the cell pellet slowly (taking about 60 sec), loosening of cell pellet using the tip of a pipette. Stir the cell clumps gently with a pipette for additional 90 sec. The cells should be seen as small aggregates in this step.Add 10 ml of prewarmed (37\u00b0C) RPMI slowly, taking 3\u20134 min for the first 1 ml drop by drop, and then taking about 6 min for the remaining 9 ml.Incubate the tube at 37\u00b0C for at least 20 min.Wash the cells twice with prewarmed RPMI.Suspend the cells with HAT-medium to a concentration of 3\u20135 \u00d7104 Sp2/O-Ag14 cells/ml and plate to 0.2 ml/well of the 96-well plates.Feed the cells with HAT-medium by changing two-thirds of the volume of the wells on the days 3, 7, and 12.The hybridoma colonies should be seen by microscope on days 3\u20137 and some fast-growing colonies should be recognizable by eye from day 7. Generally, if the immunization and cell fusion step was successful, more than 70% of the wells contain hybridoma colonies. When the sizes of the colonies becomes one-tenth to one-fifth of the 96-well bottom area, the first screening of positive clones should be taken by ELISA (see Section 3.3).The hybridoma cells in the ELISA-positive wells are recovered and cloned by a limiting dilution method as follows. Cells are counted, diluted with HAT-medium, and plated into 96-well plates so that one well contains three or ten cells; the left-half of the plate contains three cells/well and the right-half of the plate contains ten cells/well.The hybridoma colonies will be discernible after 7\u201310 days. Then the ELISA test should be performed again and the ELISA-positive wells containing single colonies are selected.The cells from the selected wells are expanded in a 24-well plate and adapted to HT-medium for at least 1 week.The cells are further adapted to the hybridoma medium for 1 week. If necessary, the cells are further adapted to a serum-free hybridoma medium.The hybridomas are now ready for collecting the mAbs. The aliquots of the cells are resuspended in freezing buffer and stored at \u2013135\u00b0C or in liquid nitrogen.\n",

After the inactivation of virus by UV-irradiation, the cell lysate is prepared in NP-40 lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7g for 20 min to remove cell debris (see\nNote 2). The supernatant is used as SARS-CoV-infected Vero cell lysate and the aliquots are stored at \u201320\u00b0C.

By utilizing established mAbs against SARS-CoV, it is possible to construct a highly sensitive antigen-capture sandwich ELISA test system for detection of SARS-CoV. The sandwich ELISA consists of two mAbs, an antigen-capturing antibody and a detecting antibody, which recognize different epitopes of the target antigen. The antigen-capturing antibody is immobilized on the ELISA plate and captures the viral antigens in the test sample. The detecting antibody is normally labeled with a signal-producing enzyme such as a peroxidase or a phosphatase. The following method is the basic procedure for constructing a sandwich ELISA (see\nNote 7).\nPurified mAb for the antigen-capture is immobilized on an Immulon-2 microplate by incubating 4 \u03bcg/ml antibody in the ELISA-coating buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight.The microplate is blocked with 1% OVA for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C.The plate is washed three times with PBS-Tween.The UV-inactivated purified SARS-CoV samples (see\nNote 1), which are serially diluted with 1% OVA/PBS-Tween, are added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature.After washing three times with PBS-Tween, wells are reacted with biotinylated detecting (second) mAb (0.1 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature.After washing three times with PBS-Tween, wells are reacted with \u03b2-D- galactosidase-labeled streptavidine for 1 h at room temperature.After washing four times with PBS-Tween, fluorescent substrate 4-methyl- umbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-galactoside is added and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C.The reaction is stopped by adding one-half volume of 0.1 M glycine-NaOH (pH10.2).The fluorescence of the reaction product, 4-methyl-umbelliferone (4-MU), is measured using FluoroScan II (Flow Laboratories Inc., Inglewood, CA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 460 nm, respectively.\n",

For a detailed account see Chapter 11 in this volume.In this step the culture supernatants are diluted to one-half in order to reduce the background of the ELISA. If the background is still high, dilution of the culture supernatants can be one-fifth to one-tenth or more with PBS-Tween.The titration of the mAbs and the second reagent is very important for obtaining the best results. It often varies from 1/100 to 1/100,000, and it should be determined for each mAb.The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is carried out by the method of Laemmli(12). The detailed conditions, such as the concentration of the gel or reducing/nonreducing and so on, should be changed case by case. Generally, loading 0.5\u201310 \u03bcg/lane of purified virus fraction would be enough for the detection of the viral antigen by the chemiluminescence method.We conveniently utilize transparent sheets such as those used for an overhead projector (OHP-sheet).In order to obtain good sensitivity and specificity of the test system, the optimization of the combination of two antibodies, i.e., coating mAb and detecting mAb, is required. This can be done by the ELISA with a matrix of candidate coating-mAbs and detecting-mAbs(6).\n",
