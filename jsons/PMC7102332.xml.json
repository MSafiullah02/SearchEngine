            "text": "Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) cause two clinical syndromes in humans: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and Europe and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas [6]. Hallmarks of both syndromes are increased vascular permeability due to dysregulation of the endothelial cell barrier and acute thrombocytopenia. Humans become infected after inhalation of aerosolized excreta of persistently infected (but asymptomatic) rodents. The most severe form of HFRS in Europe is caused by Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV), and especially by the genotypes associated with Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus ponticus rodents, which serve as natural reservoir hosts of the virus [8, 11, 19]. After an incubation period of 2-42 days (usually 2 weeks), HFRS starts with a febrile, flu-like illness lasting 3\u20137 days, followed by hypotension and oliguria (or even anuria) that may result in fatal shock. Glomerular and tubular disorders lead to kidney dysfunction and acute renal failure [10]; hemodialysis is often required. Recovery occurs after a polyuric phase, which usually starts in the second week of illness. Hemorrhagic manifestations may appear towards the end of the febrile phase, while renal failure occurs during the hypotensive phase; pulmonary involvement is present in several cases, and sometimes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops [1, 19].",

            "text": "Hantaviruses infect and replicate predominantly within vascular endothelial cells [27, 28]. Since no cytopathogenic effect is seen in endothelial cells, it has been suggested that the underlying hyperpermeability mechanisms are more complex, that humoral and cellular components of the adaptive and innate immunity contribute to hantavirus-induced disruption of the endothelial barrier, and that the extent of vascular and renal dysfunction determines the severity of the disease [24]. The observation of overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, gave rise to the hypothesis that it may play a major role in the pathogenesis of HFRS [7]. There have been several studies indicating the potential key role of some cytokines and chemokines in hantavirus infections and their correlation to disease severity [12\u201314, 26, 28]. However, studies focused specifically on DOBV pathogenesis are lacking, and the currently available studies on the immune response in DOBV infections are based on a limited number of cytokines [9, 12, 22, 25]. In order to investigate the immune response in patients with acute DOBV infection, we analyzed the levels of 27 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during the acute phase of the disease.",

Significant differences in the cytokine levels were seen between non-severe, severe, and fatal cases, which were time-dependent (time after onset of the symptoms). A strong immune response was seen during the first week of illness, especially in the severe cases, while the response in the non-severe cases was weaker and delayed.",

Elevated IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IP-10, and MIP-1b levels were seen in the fatal and severe cases, differing significantly from the non-severe cases. In previous studies, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1 have been related to severe and/or fatal cases [2, 12, 13, 17, 22]. Increased VEGF levels were seen in the survivors (with severe or non-severe disease), being higher in those with severe disease, while extremely low VEGF levels (below the control group) were seen in both samples from the fatal case (Table 2). Two additional serial samples (third and fourth) were available from the fatal case: VEGF remained low in the third serial sample and became undetectable in the fourth sample which was taken one day before death. Logistic regression analysis showed that VEGF was the cytokine significantly associated with disease severity. The higher VEGF level in severe cases can be explained by the increased need for endothelium repair in these cases. The elevation was seen even from the first week of illness and increased further in the second week, while in non-severe cases, the elevation was seen only in the second week of illness. The association of VEGF with repair of vascular damage in HFRS has been reported previously [25].",

This response was decreased in the fatal case of the present study, since IL-2, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 levels were extremely low, and the Th2/Th1 ratio was high (4.74), suggestive of predominance of the Th2 response. In contrast, these cytokines were increased in the group of the survivors (with severe or non-severe disease), suggesting an early and effective Th1 activation, which resulted in a favorable outcome. However, the Th2/Th1 ratio differed significantly between severe and non-severe cases (2.25 and 0.81, respectively, p < 0.05). Based on these results, we concluded that the Th1 response was high in the non-severe cases and low in the fatal case, while a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response was seen in the survivors of severe disease. A mixed Th1/Th2 immune response has also been reported for HPS patients, and it has been shown that the magnitude of Th1 response effector cytokines is correlated to HPS severity [3]. An association between a mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus and elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 has also been observed, which led the authors to suggest that the administration of exogenous IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 may provide antiviral benefits for the treatment of HFRS and thus warrants further investigation [7]. The level of IL-13, which is a cytokine produced by T lymphocytes, was also extremely low in the fatal case, significantly lower than in survivors with severe disease. It is of interest that the MIP-1a level was also decreased (below that of the control group) in the fatal case, while MIP-1b was on average fourfold higher than that of the control group (but lower than in the severe cases) (Table 1). In fact, MIP-1a and MIP-1b chemokines attract distinct populations of lymphocytes with MIP-1a having greater effects than MIP-1b, particularly on B cells [23].",

A correlation of IP-10 with the viral load in CCHF patients has been reported recently; given that the viral load is critical for the outcome of the disease, it was suggested that IP-10 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease [21]. Furthermore, the most significant change in cytokine expression in HFRS cases caused by another hantavirus, Puumala virus, was observed for IP-10, which increased tenfold over the control value at the onset and remained elevated through the oliguric phase, progressively decreasing to a value approximately fivefold over controls by the convalescent phase [2].",
