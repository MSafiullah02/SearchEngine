Many clustering algorithms exist but most social scientists find them difficult to understand, and tools do not provide any guidance to choose algorithms, or to evaluate results taking into account the prior knowledge of the scientists. Our work introduces a new clustering paradigm and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 5) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms and 6) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge. We describe our paradigm using an initial functional prototype, then provide two examples of use and early feedback from social scientists. We believe our clustering paradigm offers a novel constructive method to iteratively build knowledge while avoiding being overly influenced by the results of often-randomly selected black-box clustering algorithms.",

In contrast to the belief that most data is easily available on the Web, as of today, most social scientists spend a long time collecting data to construct social networks based on documents or surveys. Many projects involve a long data generation process, searching archives, interviewing participants, analyzing documents, and generating medium-sized networks (50-500 vertices), followed by careful and detailed analysis of all the relationships. Before the start of the cluster analysis a great deal of effort goes into analysing other data and gathering knowledge (which we call prior knowledge in the rest of the paper).",

However, most social scientists are not familiar with all of the available algorithms and are challenged to choose which algorithm to run, with which parameters, and how to reconcile the computed clusters with their prior knowledge.

To compute clusters, they follow a strained process: they select and run algorithms provided in the tool and then try to make sense of the results. When they are not satisfied or unsure, they iteratively tweak the parameters of the algorithms at hand, run them again and hope to get results more aligned with their prior knowledge (see the diagram on the left in Fig. 2 ).

The majority of the research is made only on topological algorithms, i.e. algorithms which use only the structure of the network to find clusters.

The graph is constructed with nodes and edges, where nodes are specified by samples that may be labeled. The edges are used to specify the similarity among the samples.

For example, the edit distance between the two partitions of 4 nodes P 1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4}} and P 2 = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}} is 1 because moving the node 3 from the first to the second set of P 1 would transform it into P 2 . A clustering can be seen as a partition since every node has a label, but the PK can only be seen as a partial partition because only some nodes are labeled. We say that the edit distance between the PK and a clustering is 0 if every group of the PK is a subset of an exclusive cluster, i.e. if every person of a PK-group is retrieved in the same cluster, with no overlaps.

            "text": "As presented in Sect. 2.5, the existing paradigms to create meaningful clusters in social networks considers three options: standard clustering, ensemble clustering, and semi-supervised clustering. Our proposed PK-clustering paradigm combines the three options in order to give more power to users in the analysis loop, and allow them to have more say in the final result. Proponents of automatic methods may argue that PK-clustering gives users too much influence on the final result as they can change the cluster assignments at will. On the other hand we know that social scientists are rarely satisfied with current clustering methods, in part because they run on graph data that do not fully mirror the knowledge they have of the social network. Moreover, traditional methods push users to believe the results of the first algorithms and parameter selection they try (often chosen randomly). Thus, PK-clustering provides a more systematic approach, letting the users think at each phase and reflect on what is going on. Instead of passively accepting what the algorithms propose, the user must provide initial hypotheses, limiting the chance of being primed by an algorithm, and explicitly validate the cluster assignment of a node, adopting a critical position to the automated results, yet with a fast interaction to accept many good suggestions quickly. Such decision may be conditioned by looking at the consensus of the clustering methods; the user might decide not to follow the consensus and assign a node to a different cluster. Another consequence of this approach is that the user participates to the process of assigning, as social scientists requires. Even if the algorithms works as a black-box model, the result of different algorithms allow the user to better understand the alternative views. It also allows users to review results that may challenge their prior knowledge.",

Moreover, expanding the exploration of parameter spaces for ensemble clustering algorithms seems needed. Another limitation of the current prototype is that some algorithms do not work well with disconnected components of the graph. Unfortunately, social scientists datasets typically have many disconnected components. This issue can be mitigated by separating components into a set of connected components, run the algorithms on them, and merge the results. Our prototype runs both with node-link and PAOH representations. But, it is better tuned to the PAOH representation because of its highly readable nodes list and table format which makes the review of consensus easier. Better coordination of the table with node link diagrams and other network visualizations is needed. Finally, annotations may be needed to document the decision process and provide an audit trail, with justifications being provided when consensual algorithm suggestions are dismissed.",

We did a benchmark of the performance on the two datasets of the case studies with a laptop equipped with an Intel Core i7-8550U CPU 1.80GHz 8 and 16 Gigabytes of memory. For the full Marie Boucher social network described in Sect. 4.1, composed of 189 nodes and 58 hyperedges (1000 edges after the unipartite projection) it took 0.6 seconds to run the 13 implemented algorithms and produce the matching. For the graph of Sect. 4.2 about the VisPubData of the VAST conference, made of 1383 nodes and 512 hyperedges (4554 edges after projection) it took 11.37 seconds to run 12 algorithms (the Label Propagation algorithm was removed because it was computationally too expensive in this case). The two datasets are representative of the many medium size datasets historians and social scientists carefully curate (i.e. 50-500 nodes, e.g. [10] ). A cut-off automatically removes algorithms that take too much resources and have still not produced a clustering after 10 seconds of computation, like it was the case for the Label Propagation algorithm on the VAST publication dataset.",

Of course, visual scalability is also an issue with larger datasets, as the list of people also grows. PAOHvis allows groups (like clusters) to be aggregated or expanded, so we expect that users would expand clusters one by one to review and consolidate them, while also being able to review the connections between proposed clusters. Pixel visualizations [25] would facilitate the review of consensus in other nodes and clusters. Classic techniques like zooming or fisheye views [23, 34] would help as long as names remain readable, which is critical to our users.",
