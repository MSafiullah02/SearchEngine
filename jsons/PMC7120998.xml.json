During recent decades different theoretical approaches have been used to facilitate and accelerate the process of new drugs creation that is not only very expensive, but also is a multistep and long-term activity [2]. The choice of approaches depends on a presence or absence of information regarding a biological target and the substances interacting with it. A situation, when we have a set of biologically active compounds (ligands) and have no information about a biological target (e.g., receptor) is the most common. Different quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) approaches are used in this case. For many years, QSAR has been used successfully for the analysis of huge variety of endpoints, e.g., antiviral and anticancer activity, toxicity [3\u201314]. Its staying power may be attributed to the strength of its initial postulate that activity is a function of structure and the rapid and extensive development of the methodology and computational techniques. The overall goals of QSAR retain their original essence and remain focused on the predictive ability of the approach and its receptiveness to mechanistic interpretation [15].",

            "text": "Many different QSAR methods [16\u201320] have been developed since the second half of the last century and new techniques and improvements are still being created [21]. These approaches differ mainly by the principles and levels of representation and description of molecular structure. The degree of adequacy of molecular structure models varies from 1D to 4D level:\n1D models consider only the gross formula of a molecule (for example, glycine \u2013 C2H4NO2). Actually, such models reflect only a composition of a molecule. Obviously, it is quite impossible to solve adequately the \u201cstructure\u2013activity\u201d tasks using such approaches. So, usually these models have an auxiliary role only, but sometimes they can be used as independent virtual screening tools [22].2D models contain information regarding the structure of a compound and are based on its structural formula [20]. Such models reflect only the topology of the molecule. These models are very popular [3, 23]. The capacity of such approaches is due to the fact that the topological models of molecular structure, in an implicit form, contain information about possible conformations of the compound. Our operational experience shows that 2D level of representation of the molecular structure is enough for the solution of more than 90% of existing QSAR/QSPR tasks.3D-QSAR models [16, 17, 19, 20] give full structural information taking into account composition, topology, and spatial shape of molecule for one conformer only. These models are widespread. However, the choice of the conformer of the molecule analyzed is mostly accidental.\n",

The essence of the strategy presented is based on the solution of QSAR problems via the sequence of the permanently improved molecular structure models (from 1D to 4D) (Figure 5-1). Thus, at each stage of the hierarchical system, the QSAR task is not solved ab ovo, but with the use of the information received from a previous stage. In fact, it is proposed to deal with a system of permanently improved solutions. It leads to more effective interpretation of the obtained QSAR models because the approach reveals molecular fragments/models for which the detailed development of structure is important.\n\n",

Then the information about the \u201cproductive\u201d (the most active) conformation is transferred to the 3D-QSAR level. This is the main difference between HiT QSAR and ordinary 3D-QSAR approaches, where the investigated conformers have been chosen through a less vigorous process.

Evidently, it is very difficult to obtain a model that can solve all the problems related to the influence of the structure of the studied molecules to the property examined. Thus, to solve every definitive task, it is necessary to develop a set of different QSAR models, where some of them are more suitable for the prediction of the studied property, the others for the interpretation of the obtained relationships, and the third for molecular design. These models altogether, in combination, solve the problem of the creation of the new compounds and issue relating to the desired set of properties. The important feature of such an approach is that the general results obtained from a few different independent models always are more relevant. It\u2019s also necessary to note that these resulting QSAR models have been chosen in accordance with the QECD principles for the validation of (Q)SARs [38], i.e., they have a defined endpoint, an unambiguous algorithm, a defined domain of applicability (DA), mechanistic interpretation, have good statistical fit, and are robust and predictive. Thus, we assume that the proposed strategy provides a solution to solve all problems dealing with virtual screening, modeling of functional (biological) targets, advancement of hypotheses regarding mechanisms of action, and, finally, the design of the new compounds with desired properties.",

In the case when a compound contains a chiral center on the atom X (X = C, Si, P, etc.), the special marks XA, XR, XS (A \u2013 achiral X atom, R \u2013 \u201cright\u201d surrounding of X atom, S \u2013 \u201cleft\u201d surrounding of X atom) can be used to reflect the stereochemistry information of such a center. In each case, the configuration (R or S) of a chiral center can be determined by the Kahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog rule [43]. For example, in the situation where atom X has been differentiated to three different types depending on its stereochemical surroundings, i.e., XA, XR, XS, the different types are analyzed in the molecular model as separate atoms. Conventionally, such molecular models can be considered as 2.5D because not only topological (molecular graph) but also stereochemical information has been taken into account. If simplex vertexes (X atoms) have been differentiated by some physical\u2013chemical properties (e.g., partial charges, lipophilicity) then the differences between atoms XA, XR, XS will be leveled as in normal 2D models.

The interaction of a mixture with a biological target cannot normally be described simply as the average between interactions of its parts, since the last interactions have different reactivity. It is also applicable for mixtures of compounds with synergetic or anti-synergetic action [45]. Because of these issues, the SiRMS approach has been developed and improved in order to make this method suitable for the execution of QSAR analysis for molecular mixtures and ensembles. With this purpose it\u2019s necessary to indicate whether the parts of unbound simplexes belong to the same molecule or to a different one. In the latter case, such unbound simplex will reflect the structure not of a single molecule, but will characterize a pair of different molecules. Simplexes of this kind are structural descriptors of the mixtures of compounds (Figure 5-3). Their usage allows for the analysis of synergism, anti-synergism, or competition in the mixture\u2019s interaction with the biological target. Obviously, such an approach is suitable for different nD-QSAR models, where n = 1\u201341. If in the same task both mixtures and single compounds have been considered, it\u2019s necessary to represent individual compounds as the mixture of two similar molecules for the correct description of such systems [46]. Thus, this approach has been named by authors as \u201cdouble nD-QSAR.\u201d Although such methodic is suitable only for binary mixtures, it can be easily extended to more complicated tasks. For molecular ensembles (associates), it is necessary to use one more simplex type \u2013 simplexes with intermolecular bonds. In this chapter, the application of the \u201cdouble nD-QSAR\u201d approach is demonstrated with the example of chiral AChE inhibitors [46] (see Section 5.4.4).\n\n",

This may be achieved using a conformational search [47] or some complementary information regarding the biologically active conformation of the molecule.

The size of a cell can be varied, by default it equals 2 \u00c5, that corresponds approximately to the average van der Waals radius of an organogenic atom.

The first procedure is an integral DA called \u201cellipsoid\u201d developed by the authors [11]. It represents a line at the 1D level; an ellipse at the 2D level; an ellipsoid at the 3D level; and multidimensional ellipsoids in more complicated n-dimensional spaces. Its essence consists of the following: the distribution of training set molecules in a space of latent variables T1\u2013TA (axes of coordinates) can be obtained from PLS. For each coordinate axis (T1 and T2 in our case) the root-mean-square deviations ST1 and ST2 have been determined. DA represents an ellipsoid that is built from the molecules of the training set distribution center (T1 = 0; T2 = 0) with the semi-axes length 3ST1 and 3ST2, respectively [11] (Figure 5-5). Further, the correct positions in relation to this center have been calculated for every molecule (including molecules from prediction set). If a work set molecule does not correspond to the DA criteria, it is termed \u201cinfluential,\u201d i.e., it has unique (for given training set) structural features that distinguish it from the other compounds. If a new molecule from the prediction set is situated out of the DA (region outside ellipsoid), its prognosis from the corresponding QSAR model is less reliable (model extrapolation). And, naturally, the prognoses for molecules nearest to the center of the DA are most reliable.\n\n",

The simplest way is soft drug design [72] that consists of replacing of undesired substituents by more active ones, or by the insertion of fragments, promoting the activity instead of non-active parts of molecule or hydrogen atoms. The use of this technique allows one to retain newly designed compounds in the same region of structural space as the training set compounds. The accuracy of prognosis can be estimated using the DA techniques (see below). However, the use of soft drug design keeps within the limits of the initial chemical class of training set compounds. More drastic drug design is, certainly, more risky, but it allows for much more dramatic results. Almost certainly, new structures would lie outside the DA region. That, however, does not mean uncertainty of prediction, but extrapolation of the model predictivity and a certain lack of any DA procedure. However, at the same time, we can receive compounds of completely different (from initial training set) chemical classes as the output of such design. It was demonstrated in [12, 28, 29], where, in searching for a new antiviral and anticancer agents, we started our investigations from macrocyclic pyridinophanes and through several convolutions of QSAR analyses came out with nitrogen analogues of crown ethers in the first and acyclic aromatic structures with the azomethine fragment in the second case.",

Spirobromine \u2013 a medicine with a nitrogen-containing dispiro structure possessing anti-HSV-1 activity was included in the training set.

Electrostatic factors (38%) and hydrophobicity (25%) were the most important determinants of antiherpetic activity (Figure 5-8). The results of the QSAR analysis demonstrate a high impact of individual structural fragments for antiviral activity. Molecular fragments that promote and interfere with antiviral activity were defined on the basis of the models obtained. Thus, for example, the insertion of non-cationic linkers such as N-(2-aminoethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine, ethylenediamine, or piperazine instead of dispirotripiperazine leads to a complete loss of activity while the presence of methyloxirane leads to a strong increase. Using the established results and observations, several new dispirotripiperazine derivatives \u2013 potential antiviral agents \u2013 were computationally designed. Two of these new compounds (1 and 2, Table 5-4) were synthesized. The results of biological tests confirm the predicted high values of antiviral activity and selectivity (they are about two logarithmic units more active and one order more selective than spirobromine) as well as low toxicity of these compounds.\n\n\n",

The common logarithms of 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in HeLa cells, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) against human rhinovirus 2 (HRV-2), and the selectivity index (SI = CC50/IC50) of [(biphenyloxy)propyl]isoxazole derivatives were used as cytotoxicity, antiviral activity, and selectivity assessments, respectively. The set of molecules consists of 18 compounds including pleconaril as a reference compound. They have not been divided into training and test sets because of the low number of compounds (i.e., the structural information contained in each molecule in this case is unique and useful). The statistic characteristics of the resulting 2D-QSAR models are quite satisfactory (R\n2 = 0.84\u20130.92; Q\n2 = 0.70\u20130.87) for the prediction of CC50, IC50, and SI values and permit the virtual screening and molecular design of new compounds with high anti-HRV-2 activity. The results indicate the high influence of atom's individuality on all the investigated properties (~40%), electrostatic factors on selectivity (~50%), where these factors along with atom individuality play the determining role, and hydrophobic interactions on the antiviral activity (~40%). The presence of terminal 5-trifluoromethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole and p-fluorophenyl fragments in a molecule leads to strong enhancement of its useful properties, i.e., increase of activity toward HRV-2 as well as selectivity and decrease of cytotoxicity. An additional terminal aromatic ring \u2013 naphthalene or phenyl \u2013 strongly reduces activity toward HRV-2 and, to a lesser degree, SI. The virtual screening and molecular design of new well-tolerated compounds with strong anti-HRV-2 activity has been performed on the basis of QSAR results. Three different DA approaches (DA rectangle and ellipsoid as well as leverage) give nearly the same results for each QSAR model and additionally allow for the estimation of the quality of the prediction for all designed compounds. A hypothesis to the effect that external benzene substituent must have negative electrostatic potential and definite length L (approximately 5.5\u20135.6 A) to possess strong antiviral activity has been suggested. Most probably, the fluorine atom in the para-position of terminal aromatic ring (compounds 2-4, Table 5-4) is quite complementary (L = 5.59 A) to the receptor cavity for such an interaction. It is necessary to note that pleconaril (L = 5.54 A) completely satisfies the indicated criteria. In the case of nitroaromatics, the accumulation of nitro groups in the region of receptor cavity will lead to strengthening of electrostatic interactions with the biological target and, therefore, to an increase in activity.",

The comprehensive analysis of variations in toxicity as a function of the position and nature of the substituent was performed. Among the contributions analyzed in this work are the electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions of toxicants to biological targets. Molecular fragments that promote and interfere with toxicity were defined on the basis of models obtained. In particular, it was found that in most cases, insertion of fluorine and hydroxyl groups into nitroaromatics increases toxicity, whereas insertion of a methyl group has the opposite effect. The influence of chlorine on toxicity is ambiguous. Insertion of chlorine at the ortho-position to the nitro group leads to substantial increase in toxicity, whereas the second chlorine atom (at the para-position to the first) results in a considerable decrease in toxicity. The mutual influence of substituents in the benzene ring is substantially non-additive and plays a crucial role regarding toxicity.

Electron-donating substituents (o\n\u2013OCH3, o\n\u2013OH, o\n\u2013Cl) at the ortho-position of phenyl ring strongly promoted affinity. A 2,3-dihydrobenzodioxin-5-yl residue has a similar influence on affinity. Electron-accepting substituents (m-CF3) in phenyl have high affinity. Electron-accepting substituents at the para-position of the phenyl ring (p\n-NO2, p\n-F) have a stronger negative influence on affinity to 5-HT1AR than electron-donating ones (p\n\u2013OCH3). The following conclusions have been made about the influence of the terminal fragments (substituents of N-alkyl group) on affinity. Saturated polycyclic fragments and small aromatic residues demonstrated positive influence on affinity and larger aromatic fragments show a negative effect.

Alongside the positive effect of biphenyl and diphenyloxide fragments on catalytic activity of the investigated compounds, the slight preference of \u201ctransoid\u201d on cis-conformations of crown ethers containing mentioned fragments was shown. The undesirability of the cyclohexyl fragment was determined as well as the certain limits of crown ether dentacy (4\u20138). These findings, as well as the predominant role of electrostatic factors in investigated process (~50%), correspond to the known mechanisms of catalytic action of the crown ethers.
