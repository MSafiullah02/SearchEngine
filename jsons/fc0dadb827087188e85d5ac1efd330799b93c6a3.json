The host immune system has evolved mechanisms to tolerate these commensal organisms while at the same time providing protection for the host from pathogens. Therefore, not surprisingly, extensive crosstalk exists between the host and the luminal environment of the intestine. In addition to the widely recognized role of commensal bacteria, other types of microbes including viruses participate in this crosstalk. Recent work has begun to define the intestinal virome and to determine its functional interactions with other microbes and the host in health and various disease states.",

Interestingly, the viruses could be classified in three major groups including mammalian viruses (Circoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Coronaviridae), insect viruses (Densoviridae, Iridoviridae, Polydnaviridae, Dicistroviriade, Bromoviridae, and Virgaviridae), and plant viruses (Nanoviridae, Geminiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, Secoviridae, Partitiviridae, Tymoviridae, Alphaflexiviridae, and Tombusviridae). Similarly, Ge et al. examined viral like particles present in bat fecal samples collected in China [2] . Among the eukaryotic viruses, the most frequent reads were related to vertebrate viruses (coronaviruses, parvoviruses), insect viruses (densoviruses, dicistroviruses), and plant viruses (tobamoviruses). One interpretation of these data is that the substantial contribution of insect and plant viruses in these fecal viromes reflects the largely insect and plant diets of these animals. Whether these viruses affect the physiology of the rodent host has yet to be determined.",

Consistent with the results seen by Reyes et al., they found robust intrapersonal stability and interpersonal variation, with a high representation of bacteriophages. Furthermore, this interpersonal variation was present even among individuals on the same diet, suggesting that the vast majority of phage populations are not acquired via a daily transient means such as food intake. Interestingly, the proportions of preexisting viral populations were found to be significantly changed after alteration of diet. Thus, the virome composition does respond to diet through as yet unclear mechanisms.",

This Type I IFN response was abrogated in cells lacking NOD2. Interestingly, this effect was greater at earlier time points compared to late. It is thought that other PRRs such as RIG-I may activate the IRF3-IFN pathway at the later time points, whereas NOD2 may act in an earlier role. In addition, the authors showed that NOD2 was able to associate with viral RNA but not control host RNA in an immunoprecipitation assay. Nod2 was also found to interact with MAVS via the leucine-rich-region of the nucleotide binding domain. Finally, Nod2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice failed to efficiently produce interferon after infection, which corresponded with increased viral titers and enhanced susceptibility to virus-induced pathogenesis.",

Not only can type I IFNs be produced by almost every cell type, but the receptor is expressed ubiquitously as well. Receptor binding leads to phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), resulting in activation of several signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family members. In the case of STAT1 and STAT2 activation, IRF9 is recruited to form the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) [24, 25] . ISGF3 translocates into the nucleus, binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) leading to transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that play an important antiviral role.",

Although distantly related to type I IFNs (15-20% amino acid identity), type III IFNs were also shown to be induced by viral infection and exhibited antiviral activity [28] . The IFN-ls signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex (IL-10Rb and IL-28Ra) that is distinct from the type I IFN receptor complex, but both have similar intracellular signaling pathways (see above) resulting in functionally similar biological activities. As a result, signaling via type III IFNs leads to a type I IFN-like gene expression profile. Early experiments showed that many cell types could express both Type I and Type III IFNs in response to viral infection or TLR stimulation. However, a major difference was found to lie in the cell type able to respond to these different IFNs. While most nucleated cells are able to response to type I IFNs, the type III IFN receptor complex expressing cells are limited to a smaller subset including pDCs, keratinocytes, and epithelial cells of the respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, initial studies seem to indicate that most of the functions elicited by IFN-ls were redundant to the type I IFN responses, and IFN-ls alone were not sufficient to protect against systemic virus infections.",

In addition, these authors show that the treatment of suckling mice with IFN-l before oral infection repressed rotavirus replication in gut, whereas treatment of type I IFN was not effective.

These antibiotic-treated mice showed decreased titers of virusspecific antibody, impaired CD4/CD8 T cell responses, and increased pulmonary viral titers at day 9 post infection. Interestingly, administration of TLR ligands locally (intranasal) and distally (intrarectal) at the time of influenza infection were both able to restore the antibody and T cell responses in the antibiotic-treated mice.
