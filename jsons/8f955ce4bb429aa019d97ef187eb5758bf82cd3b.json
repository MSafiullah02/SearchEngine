In March, 2003 , the putative cause of SARS was identified as a new coronaviru~.~~~ SARS-Cov is a member of the coronoviridae family of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses, which have a broad host range. The length of genome sequence for coronaviruses is about 27-32 kb and it could encode 23 putative proteins, including main proteinase (Mp. also called 3 C L 9 , nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M) , and small envelope (E). Because the viral main proteinase ( 3 C L 9 controls the activities of the coronavirus replication complex, it is an attractive target for therapy and drug design4 A large number of compounds were synthesized and separated, in order to find anti-SARS lead compounds. V i a l screening has the advantages of that searching lead structures is cheaper than the real experiment and the calculation could be performed on compounds that are not yet purchased or synthesized.* So virtual screening was used widely to fmd initial lead structures from large compound collections. Therefore, some amounts of work were done to search the inhibitor of SARS.6",

The region of binding site for lLV0 is the same as that of 1P9S. It shows that this region of the substrate binding sites is remarkably conserved!

AutoGrid pre-calculates a three-dimensional grid of interaction energies based on the macromolecular target using the AMBER force field. AutoDock can begin the process of simulation. First, the ligand moves randomly in any one of six degrees of freedom (either translation or rotation) and the energy of the new ligand \"state\" is calculated. If the energy of the new state is lower than that of the old state, the new one is automatically accepted as the next step in docking.

Usually it can be estimated by the estedwater distribution coefficient (log P). Therefore in this study, log P is used as another criterion for virtual screening. At the process of virtual screening, we also think about the standard of electrostatic potential and formation 'of hydrogen bond. All these features are used as the fdters of the virtual screening.

From these 25000 structures by using the filters we firstly selected the compounds of macro lactones. Then they were aligned to Ag7088 and the binding free energies with 3CLp\" were calculated. We considered that their binding free energies for these 43 structures are less than -63.42 Wmol as the potential lead structures. The screening results are presented in Figure 5 The ratio between potential lead structures and the total screened structures is 2.79%. This shows that Ag7088 is a good reference structure for screenkg and our screening strategy is feasible. Among 43 potential lead structures only 6 structures bind with 3CLF0 receptor at active site. Their binding free energies, log P, the size of ring and comments are gathered in Table 1 . Because the influence of hydrophobicity is important, log P, values of structures N3 and 3 5 approach to that of Ag7088. The ring of those structures is from 18 to 19 membered cycle in size It suggests that suitable large ring could locate at the active site of receptor. Figure 6 is an example of docking complex for structure N1. Structure N1 locates at the active site of 3CLPr0. The electrostatic potential of N1 and 3CLpro is complementary to each other. This could increase the binding affinity between ligands and the receptor and the interaction is favorable to bioactivity. There are one hydrogen bond between oxygen atom (0 =C) of N1 and the residue Glu165, and two hydrogen bonds between NH and residues Phe139 and Hisl71. For N3, two oxygen atoms of carbonyl are linked by hydrogen bond to residue Glu16.5. From investigation on the complex of N4-3CLPr0, there are four hydrogen bonds between the ligand and residues Glu165, Gln187, Phel39 and Hisl71. There is also one hydrogen bond between N5 and the residue GIn191, N6 and the residue His163, respectively. These hydrogen bonds seem to be favourable to the activity.",
