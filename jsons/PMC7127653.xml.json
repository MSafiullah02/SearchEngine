One strategy aimed at assessing the functionality of the immune system consists of non-pathogen-specific immune monitoring, consisting of serum immunoglobulins, serum complement factors, peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations, soluble CD30, and iATP in CD4+ T cells.1 Ideally, these would help to demonstrate one aspect of the overall \u201cnet state of immunosuppression.\u201d The \u201cnet state of immunosuppression\u201d comprises all factors that may contribute to the risk of infection; this includes preexisting immune deficits, colonization with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, immunosuppressive agents, acquired immunodeficiency, prior antimicrobial therapies, mucocutaneous barrier integrity, fluid collections, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and viral coinfections.2\n",

It is thought that SOT recipients do not necessarily clinically behave in the same manner due to underlying immunosuppression, and in fact, tend to present with organ failure and thrombocytopenia during sepsis.10 Universal risk factors for sepsis, regardless of transplanted organ, are CMV serology mismatch, particularly positive donor to negative recipient, CMV disease, which inherently demonstrates an immunomodulatory effect predisposing recipients to higher rates of bacterial and fungal sepsis, prolonged duration of graft cold ischemia, prolonged duration of surgical transplantation procedure, and requirement of large amounts of blood transfusion.10, 11 Management should consist of rapid initiation of intravenous antibiotics, rapid diagnosis, source control, aggressive search for pathologic condition that mimics severe sepsis, and reduction in immunosuppressive drugs.10\n",

In lung transplant recipients, bacterial pneumonia or bronchitis accounts for 32% to 63% of all infections with the incidence of bacterial pneumonia peaking in the first 4 to 8 postoperative weeks and then declines by the fourth month. Perioperative antibiotics, which are focused on preoperative cultures from the recipient and donor, reduce the incidence of early bacterial pneumonia to less than 10%.20, 21 Regarding cardiac, hepatic, and renal transplants, the incidence of early bacterial pneumonia is 15%, 9%, and 4% to 6%, respectively,18, 19, 20, 26, 27 with a mortality of 21% to 35% in liver and kidney transplant recipients. However, mortality between nosocomial and community-acquired infection was extreme at 58% compared with 8%20, 21, 22 with mechanical ventilation and nosocomial infections at a higher increased risk for death.18, 20, 21, 22, 24 In the initial perioperative period, nosocomial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter species, and S aureus, including methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA), should be considered in the immediate perioperative period; however, prolonged mechanical ventilation following transplant increases the risk for nosocomial pneumonia.20, 21, 22 Community-acquired pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Legionella species, may be seen. With the implementation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, the incidence of Nocardia pneumonia has decreased; however, it is still reported.20, 28 Empiric treatment should take into consideration previous microbiological data, local epidemiology, and recent clinical history with regards to empiric antibiotic coverage.",

Transmission occurs by respiratory route, person-to-person contact, or fecal-oral route. The true incidence among SOT recipients is unknown, with most infections occurring within the first year after transplantation.37 Clinical manifestations can vary; however, when affecting lung transplant recipients, it can produce a range of clinical manifestations, including acute flulike illness, diffuse alveolar damage, or necrotizing pneumonia along with chronic changes, such as bronchiolitis obliterans, interstitial fibrosis, or bronchiectasis.38, 39, 40, 41 Viral culture, direct antigen detection, molecular methods, and histopathology are available for diagnosis with histopathologic evaluation, as the gold standard for the diagnosis of invasive disease. Rapid antigen detection kits, in particular, immunofluorescence assays when processing respiratory specimens, are commercially available, which yield rapid and specific results. PCR, qualitative and quantitative, has emerged as a widely used tool for detection because it is highly sensitive and rapid. Recovery of adenovirus from respiratory samples does not necessarily confirm disease because patients can shed asymptomatically for a prolonged period of time; therefore, it is essential to correlate with clinical findings along with detection of virus from other sites and histopathological findings. Cidofovir has the best evidence to support its use in the treatment of adenoviral infections. Brincidofovir, the lipid conjugate of cidofovir, has also demonstrated in vitro susceptibility and appears to be promising in vivo with regards to SOT recipients; however, further studies are warranted.42\n",

The immunomodulatory effects of CMV, impaired T-cell and phagocytic function, and cytokine dysregulation can lead to opportunistic infections, rejection, graft loss, and reduced survival.43, 44 The transplant recipients who are at highest risk are seronegative recipients of seropositive organ, D+/R\u2212, because they have no preexisting immunity, and seropositive recipients, D\u2212/R+, are at intermediate risk. There is little difference between D+/R+ and D\u2212/R\u2212 groups, with potentially worse outcomes in D+/R+ (Fig. 3\n).43 Clinical presentation consists of dyspnea, fever, and malaise with the identification of characteristic CMV cells in lung tissue. Radiographic changes are nonspecific and include diffuse haziness, focal haziness, focal lobar consolidation, and no change.20 Diagnosis is made via cell culture viral isolation; however, this can be time consuming. Therefore, the detection of CMV DNA by PCR in the peripheral blood leukocytes, providing a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 76% for CMV pneumonitis, along with the BAL CMV DNA PCR, is an alternative means to diagnosis.20, 45 However, with regards to the BAL findings, it would be imperative to differentiate between infections versus shedding; hence, the concomitant peripheral blood leukocyte PCR along with the clinical picture is necessary to help determine the diagnosis. Treatment consists of ganciclovir or the oral alternative, valganciclovir. Foscarnet and cidofovir are alternative options; however, they are primarily reserved when there is a concern for resistance or documented resistance because their side-effect profiles are less desirable.20 CMV immunoglobulin in conjunction with treatment offers limited efficacy.43 Maribavir, brincidofovir, and letermovir are novel agents that may provide alternative options for treatment; however, further studies are warranted.",

Tissue invasion by fungal organisms is the gold standard for diagnosis of invasive fungal pneumonia. However, this may be difficult to obtain; therefore, International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation developed guidelines, A 2010 Working Formulation for the Standardization of Definitions of Infections in Cardiothoracic Transplant Recipients, to assist in the diagnosis of not only fungal infections but also bacterial and viral infections. These definitions may also be applied to abdominal transplant recipients. Treatment is as follows in Fig. 4\n; however, be aware of drug-drug interactions with regards to immunosuppressive agents. It is important to note, however, that empiric management of mold infections in SOT recipients is seldom necessary. The optimal approach is to pursue the diagnostic workup aggressively and treat accordingly even in lung transplant recipients.",

Unfortunately, there are no clinical trials in the management of Candida UTI in SOT.100 Candiduria is frequent, occurring in up to 11% of KTR; however, it is mostly asymptomatic.95 Asymptomatic candiduria is usually treated as there is concern regarding the allograft and potential for complications regarding the upper urinary tract; however, it should only be treated if the patient is neutropenic, or undergoing a urologic procedure.95, 100 Candiduria should be classified based on risk factors for disseminated candidiasis. Urinary catheters should be removed or exchanged, and candiduria should be confirmed with a second, clean voided urine culture. Disseminated candidiasis may be considered if clinical manifestations are consistent (eg, positive blood cultures, a second urine culture after removal or replacement of the urinary catheter, funduscopic examination, cultures from any other significant site, and kidney imaging). Persistent candiduria along with no indwelling catheters should prompt imaging of the kidneys and collecting system to exclude renal abscess, fungus balls, or other urologic abnormalities. Treatment options can range from fluconazole treatment of choice, to echinocandins, amphotericin B, and flucytosine depending on the clinical situation and organism sensitivities with durations from at least 14 days for UTI to 2 to 4 weeks for pyelonephritis (Box 2\n).100\nBox 2Duration of antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections\n\u2022Fluconazole is the treatment of choice for cystitis and pyelonephritis\u2022Alternative options:\u25cbSingle dose of parenteral AMB deoxycholate with or without 5-flucytosine for cystitis; d-AMB can also be used for pyelonephritis\u25cbAMB deoxycholate bladder irrigation for cystitis\u25cbLiposomal AMB with or without 5-flucytosine for pyelonephritis (low concentrations in urine therefore relapse may occur)\u25cbEchinocandins, drug of choice in unstable patients with systemic candidiasis for pyelonephritis (low concentrations in urinary tract and therefore relapse may occur)\n\n\nAbbreviations: AMB, Amphotericin B; d-AMB, Amphotericin B deoxycholate.Data from Vidal E, Cervera C, Cordero E, et al.
