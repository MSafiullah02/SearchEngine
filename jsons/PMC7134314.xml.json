To acquire a holistic understanding, we gather responses from private-sector respondents who mention that planning is a very crucial success factor of the procurement function as they perform a thorough analysis of the intended goods, services, or project. The study further explores the specific steps taken by contractors and suppliers who provide goods and services for clients who communicate via emails, or phone calls. Most respondents indicate they do not move beyond a re-order level to have stock available in the case of an emergency. In cases where the procuring entity is a large organization such as a government ministry, respondents usually place orders directly from the international manufacturers as opposed to using intermediaries. This reduces the delivery time and enables specific demand of the procuring entity to be met.",
