Many researchers have reported that novel coronavirus is an acute respiratory disease, which may affect the lungs and respiratory system (Gautam and Trivedi 2020; Chen et al. 2020). As of April 24, 2020, there are a total of 2,709,483 and 190,861 persons reported as confirmed cases and as number of total deaths, respectively. There are three categories (i.e., history of smoking, older age, high blood pressure and heart diseases) which are considered important factors associated with the development of the diseases (Wu et al. 2020; Gautam and Trivedi 2020; Gautam and Hens 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Muhammad et al. 2020). According to a report released by the Italian Institute of Health, 481 patients having background diseases passed away due to novel coronavirus infection. In this regard, Fig. 1 shows the description of the background diseases evident in over 20% of the cases due to COVID-19.",

Persinger et al. (2002) reported the effects of long-term exposure to NO2 on lungs (damage to epithelial cells) and respiratory functions. Faustini et al. (2014) stated that the mortality rate can be increased due to the short- and long-term exposure to NO2. As per documents, a total of 2.6 million people are significantly affected due to the degradation of air quality. Cohen et al. (2017) reported respiratory and pathogenic effects due to exposure to air pollutants and also suggested a link between air pollution and sick building syndromes.",
