Fifty-two biomolecules were significantly different either in multigroup comparisons or in comparisons between patients with RA and those with NRA (Table II\n). Thirty-seven of these 52 biomolecules distinguished patients with RA from those with NRA (Table II and see Fig E1, C). Because BAL fluid neutrophils were one of the cell types that distinguished patients with RA from those with NRA, we focused on neutrophil-associated biomolecules for this study. We identified 17 neutrophil-associated biomolecules with levels that were significantly increased in patients with RA when compared with those in patients with NRA and healthy control subjects (Table III\n). Of these 17 biomolecules, 13 showed a significant positive correlation with the BAL fluid neutrophil count (Table IV\n). Four biomolecules did not show any significant correlation. It is noteworthy that levels of only one of these 13 biomolecules, CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2), correlated with BAL fluid eosinophil counts. We classified these biomolecules based on their published cellular sources (see Table E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). This classification suggests that innate immune and airway tissue cells are the primary source of RA-associated proneutrophilic biomolecules. This also implies that activation of innate immune and airway tissue cells contributes significantly to RA.",

For this reason, we analyzed data with and without inclusion of patients receiving oral corticosteroids (OCSs). BAL fluid neutrophil counts were increased in both infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA regardless of their OCS use compared with healthy control subjects (Fig 1\n, A). Blood neutrophil counts were also increased in both infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA when the data were analyzed for the entire group (Fig 1, B). However, this increase was lost in the blood but not BAL fluid (Fig 1, C and D) in the infection-negative RA group when the patients receiving OCSs were excluded from analysis. The results suggest that blood neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA was caused by OCSs. Strikingly, the absolute neutrophil number remained increased in the infection-positive RA group, even when the patients receiving OCSs were excluded from the analysis. The results indicate that an increase in absolute neutrophil counts could serve as a blood biomarker for airway infection in patients with RA. The results also suggest that blood neutrophilia in this subgroup was due to airway infection (Fig 1, C).",

For this reason, we analyzed BAL fluid eosinophils and neutrophils separately in infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA and compared them with counts in patients with NRA. Median BAL eosinophil counts were 1, 1, and 1 in patients with NRA, infection-positive patients with RA, and patients with infection-negative RA, respectively. On the other hand, median BAL fluid neutrophil counts were 2.2, 8, and 3.2 in patients with NRA, infection-positive patients with RA, and infection-negative patients with RA, respectively, and the difference among the groups was statistically significant (P = .02).",

We identified 51 biomolecules with increased levels in asthmatic patients, and 36 of them distinguished RA from NRA. Sixteen biomolecules correlated with neutrophilic asthma. The vast majority of these biomolecules are known to be produced by macrophages and airway epithelial cells, which indirectly points to their role in patients with neutrophilic asthma. A pathway analysis identified neutrophilic influx as an important biological process in RA. Multiple previous studies demonstrated a similar role for neutrophilic inflammation in severe asthma.

Our analysis of patients who were not taking OCSs suggested that systemic steroids contributed to blood but not airway neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA. Our understanding of the role of inhaled steroids in patients with airway neutrophilia is incomplete. A previous study showed that systemic but not inhaled steroids were associated with tissue neutrophilia.39 However, this study was done with a small number of patients, and the result showed a trend for increased airway neutrophil counts with inhaled steroids. Both patients with NRA and those with RA were receiving inhaled steroids in our study. However, unlike patients with RA, not all patients with NRA received maximal doses of inhaled steroids. Thus it is possible that higher doses of inhaled steroids in patients with RA contributed to some extent to airway neutrophilia. Environmental toxicants frequently induce cytokines/chemokines that can elicit low-level neutrophilic inflammation.40 There could be a cumulative effect during aging. The TH17 immune response induces neutrophilic inflammation in animal models.16 Our assay did not detect IL-17, likely because of the low sensitivity of the assay. However, the assay detected increased levels of multiple proneutrophilic biomolecules, including SAA, NAP2, thrombospondin 1, IL-6, IL-8, C3, CCL3, CCL20, epidermal growth factor, and receptor for advanced glycosylation end products. All except the last 3 significantly correlated with BAL fluid neutrophil counts. SAA induces granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and stimulates neutrophil generation.41 It also induces TH17.42 IL-6 is an inducer of TH1743 and a marker of systemic inflammation.44 NAP2, IL-8, C3, and CCL3 directly induce neutrophilic inflammation.45, 46, 47, 48 C3 also induces IL-1, IL-8, and other cytokines/chemokines, which could indirectly affect neutrophilic inflammation.48 Some of our findings on biomolecules are in agreement with those of many previous studies. Similar to our finding, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 discriminated severe from moderate asthma in a SARP study.25 IL-8 levels have previously been reported to be increased in sputum49, 50 and BAL fluid51 from patients with RA and neutrophilic asthma.",

Our study identified a unique subgroup of infection-negative patients with neutrophilic RA, which was selectively associated with increased markers of inflammation in serum. These markers included IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL3. The concomitant increase in C-reactive protein levels in the same patients suggested a systemic inflammatory process akin to what has been observed in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular52 and autoinflammatory53 diseases. Remarkably, this subgroup of patients also had increases in 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors: GDF-1554 and soluble ST2 (IL-33 receptor).52 We recognize that the latter is a nonspecific biomarker of systemic inflammation. Four (11%) of 36 (11%) infection-negative patients with neutrophilic RA and 5 (21%) of 24 infection-positive patients with neutrophilic RA had a history of cardiovascular disease. Therefore the frequency of existing cardiovascular disease did not explain the systemic (serum) increase in levels of these inflammatory cytokines. We also did not find any correlation of these inflammatory cytokines with other common comorbidities: diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",

The reason for this reduced expression in patients with NRA but not those with RA is not clear. Ficolin 3 is the only biomolecule in the serum that distinguished RA from NRA.

The results underscore the importance of the selection of an appropriate antibiotic (targeting gram-positive vs gram-negative bacteria) and its application to a properly identified target patient population. If low-level systemic inflammation is indeed the cause of airway neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA, this hypothesis can be tested by using therapeutic agents targeting molecules, such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8.

Reduced numbers of tryptase-positive cells representing mast cells in patients with severe asthma was previously reported in a SARP study.62 This was thought to be due to the loss of tryptase as a consequence of mast cell degranulation. However, unlike tryptase, CD117 is a cell-surface marker and not a granular protein and is not expected to be affected by mast cell degranulation. It is possible that the reduced CD117+ cell number is a consequence of the underlying disease process.Clinical implicationsThis study identifies airway neutrophils and proneutrophilic biomolecules as significant contributors to RA. A subgroup of neutrophilic asthma was associated with a subclinical infection. This group is likely to benefit from specific antimicrobial therapy. Neutrophilic asthma without a subclinical infection showed signs of systemic inflammation. Therapies targeting proneutrophilic biomolecules, autoinflammation, or both are likely to control asthma in this subgroup.\n",
