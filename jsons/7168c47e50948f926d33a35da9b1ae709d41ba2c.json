A population-based survey reported that more than 75 % of respondents would avoid public transportation and 20-30 % would try to avoid crowded environments as precautionary actions in response to a hypothetical influenza pandemic [22] . During the 2009 H1N1 influenza, an initial high level of anxiety about the pandemic has been observed [11] and different behavioral changes triggered by the perceived risk of infection have been reported [7, 21, [23] [24] [25] . In Australia, after the first pandemic wave, individuals \"reported increasing handwashing (46 %) and covering cough and sneezes (27 %)\" to reduce the risk of infection [24] . In the USA, data collected on public response to H1N1 influenza from May 2009 to June 2009 suggest that \"16 to 25 % of Americans had avoided places where many people are gathered, like sporting events, malls, or public transportation and 20 % had reduced contact with people outside [their] household as much as possible\" [25] . Furthermore, larger uncoordinated behavioral changes have been detected for more severe epidemics. For instance, an 80 % reduction in travel to and from Hong Kong has been reported during the 2003 SARS crisis [9] . This empirical evidence highlights that behavioral response occurs when a new infectious disease emerges, although it is hard to quantify its impact on the epidemic spread.",

In this case, the \"recovery from fear\" occurs at a constant rate, regardless the current state of the epidemic and the behavior adopted by the individuals.

The approach considered in this chapter is based on evolutionary game theory [12] , which allows considering a symmetric mechanism regulating spontaneous behavioral changes.

This defensive response accounts for both reduction in physical contacts and, more in general, all self-prophylaxis measures which can reduce the transmission probability during these contacts. For instance, a reduction in the number of contacts can be achieved by avoiding crowded environments or by limiting travels, whereas a reduction in transmission probability can occur as a consequence of an increased wariness in common activities (e.g., the behavioral goals recommended by the WHO for reducing influenza transmission, such as washing hands frequently or respecting cough/respiratory etiquette).",

As mentioned above, a major responsiveness of the population to an infection corresponds to a small prevalence threshold (large values of m) and to large values of \u03c1. The responsiveness of the population is related to time at which the behavioral response starts to affect the population behavior. As the population responsiveness increases, a larger reduction in the final epidemic size and in the daily peak prevalence is observed (see Fig. 2a and b) . However, if the prevalence threshold 1/m is larger than the maximum prevalence of infections, or the imitation process is too slow (i.e., for small values of \u03c1), the human response never takes place and the epidemic spreads following the dynamics of an SIR model driven by R n 0 . An unreachable prevalence threshold represents the situation in which the epidemic is not perceived sufficiently severe to trigger a behavioral response of the population. This happens when 1/m is larger than",

On the other hand, a decrease in the perceived risk of infection is observed, despite the (slow) increase in the actual number of cases. In fact, the latter depends on the combination of two opposite phenomena: the increase of new infections and the decline (slowed by the memory mechanism) of the perceived prevalence, which was overestimated in the early phases of the epidemic. As the perceived prevalence goes below the risk threshold 1/m, the normal behavior starts to spread quickly in the population as the most convenient strategy to be adopted through the subsequent course of the epidemic. This leads to a sudden change in the growth rate of the epidemic which is triggered by an increase of R 0 . Model simulations show that the two distinct exponential growth phases observed for ILI incidence correspond to an initial diffusion of the altered behavior in the population, which determines an epidemic spread driven by R a 0 , and a second phase characterized by the diffusion of the normal behavior, where the spread is driven R n 0 . The best estimate for R a 0 is 1.24 and for R n 0 is 1.48. Estimates of R n 0 , i.e. the basic reproductive number for a population in which the normal behavior is widely adopted, are in good agreement with those obtained for the 2009 influenza pandemic [2, 3, 10, 16] . The model explains the observed ILI incidence only if an initial (persistent) diffusion of the altered behavior in the population is considered. Specifically, an initial perceived risk of infection above the risk threshold, a long-lasting memory (able to keep the altered behavior as apparently more convenient over a relevant period of time), and a fast imitation process (enough to produce a sudden change in the force of infection) are required.",

Our performed investigation singles out the main determinants of human behavior and risk perception leading to remarkable alterations of the dynamics of an epidemic outbreak. First, if the perceived risk associated to an epidemic is sufficiently large, even a small decrease in the number of potentially infectious contacts can remarkably reduce the impact of an epidemic. Second, the disease spread is highly sensitive to how rapidly people adopt self-protecting behavioral patterns. Third, when the population becomes aware only late of a new epidemic outbreak, the effectiveness of human response reduces. However, when the mechanism regulating the spread of information about the disease is sufficiently fast, spontaneous social distancing is always effective.",
