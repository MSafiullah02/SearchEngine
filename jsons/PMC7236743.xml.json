While an immune response is important to fight the infection, an excessive and dysregulated immune overactivation is likely to contribute to the development of ARDS and multi-organ failure, including \u201cbrain failure\u201d or delirium (16). Many pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-1 \u03b2) and chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL-5) have been linked to the development of ARDS, a frequent cause of mortality in patients with COVID-19 (15); the same have been associated with the development of delirium16. Specifically, Qin et al described extensive dysregulation of the immune response in patients with COVID-19 (17). Moreover, cytokine storm is fueled by the release of catecholamines by immune cells via a self-amplifying circuit (18). Catecholamines, such as norepinephrine, might also be elevated in hyperactive delirium contributing to its pathophysiology and symptomology (16). Our patient\u2019s course was characterized by significant agitation, requiring use of multiple high-dose sedatives. This agitation, along with ARDS, might be one presentation of the cytokine storm and catecholamine release in this patient population.",

Due to the high infectivity of this virus, shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and medical isolation to decrease virus transmission, COVID-19 patients might not have the benefit of conventional non-pharmacological prevention strategies or the support of loved ones (21). The staff is unable to spend time and provide frequent re-orientation and cognitive stimulation for the patients, while family members are not allowed to visit and provide visual cues, reassurance, and practical support. In addition, unusual configuration of the rooms, inability to recognize faces due to staff\u2019s extensive PPE, and potentially even the use of the virtual modalities to communicate (e.g., remote telemedicine and virtual visits with family members) as opposed to live visits, all might worsen patients\u2019 perception of the reality and contribute to disorientation and confusion.",

Yet, up to 30% of patients might not be able to complete screening tools that require patient participation (9). Thus, a novel tool, the S-PTD, might be particularly helpful as it relies on nursing report of patients\u2019 cognition and behaviors, rather than on patient\u2019s participation (10,11). Our patient was initially evaluated remotely from outside of the room integrating review of the chart and descriptions of her behavior and mental status from her nursing and medical staff. CAM-ICU and S-PTD were also used in her evaluation and diagnosis. As patient improved and was able to engage in an evaluation, she was interviewed virtually with the use of telemedicine.",

While increasing doses of quetiapine did not seem helpful in our patient, switching to haloperidol in combination with other interventions, was correlated with improvement in patient\u2019s mental status. Haloperidol might have been more helpful due to its more potent dopamine blockade and minimal antihistaminic and anticholinergic activity as compared to quetiapine. In addition, haloperidol has been found to be an effective antagonist of Sigma-1 receptors, which, in theory, might potently protect against oxidative stress-related cell death (27).
