After its emergence, the original type CPV-2 was replaced by three antigenic variants termed CPV-2a, and CPV-2c (Buonavoglia et al., 2001; Parrish et al., 1991; Parrish, O'Connell, Evermann, & Carmichael, 1985) . During the years, several amino acid (aa) changes were accounted in the VP2 gene sequence (Battilani et al., 2001; Geng et al., 2015; Jeoung, Ahn, & Kim, 2008; Nakamura et al., 2004; Truyen, 1999) and, only recently, the analysis of the NS1 gene sequence was included in the CPV phylogenies (Canuti, Rodrigues, Whitney, & Lang, 2017; Grecco et al., 2018; Han et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018; Mira et al., 2019; P\u00e9rez et al., 2014; Zhuang et al., 2019) .",

Indeed, the Asian CPV-2c variant shows specific amino acids in NS1 (60V, 544F, 545V, 630P) and VP2 (5A/G, 267Y, 297A, 324I, 370R) gene sequences. Most of these amino acids have been described in the VP2 of CPV-2a/2b/2c strains collected in China, Vietnam, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Japan (Chiang et al., 2016; Geng et al., 2015; Han et al., 2015; Jeoung et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2014; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2004; Phromnoi, Sirinarumitr, & Sirinarumitr, 2010; Soma, Taharaguchi, Ohinata, Ishii, & Hara, 2013; Xu et al., 2015; Yi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2010) . In particular, CPV-2c strains displaying the amino acid glycine (G) instead of the highly conserved alanine (A) at residue 5 of the VP2 have been previously detected in China (Wang et al., 2016) and Italy (Mira, Purpari, Lorusso, et al., 2018) . More recently, molecular analyses including the NS1 gene sequence showed the presence of molecular signatures of the Asian CPV strains even in this region (Han et al., 2015; Mira, Purpari, Lorusso, et al., 2018; Zhuang et al., 2019) . Indeed, it results critical to extend the analysis to other genomic regions to properly infer the spread of the genetic CPV variants (Grecco et al., 2018) . (NS1: 60V, 544F, 545F, 630P -NS2: 60V, 151N, 152V) could contribute to further elucidate its evolution ).",

As observed also in this study, phylogeny lacks any clustering based on the single VP2 aa residue 426 (CPV-2a/2b/2c), as well as on the geographic origin and period of sample collection. Therefore, a wider evolutionary analysis further supports the thesis to consider the CPV antigenic variants as variants of CPV-2a rather than distinct subtypes (Organtini, Allison, Lukk, Parrish, & Hafenstein, 2015) and could be considered as a more reliable tool in outbreak tracing.",

Despite the close genetic relationship with the previous Asian CPV-2c strain reported in Italy, its absence in the following months suggests a second introduction of Asian CPV-2c strains. Alternatively, the silent circulation of the original Asian strain in the field with accumulation of few point mutation should be hypothesized. The evidence in rescued stray dogs and in dogs without anamnesis of previous movements, as well as the different dates and places of collection, suggested the active spread of these strains in the field. It remains unclear how these strains have been introduced in Italy, if directly through infected animals or indirectly due to the extreme stability of the CPV in the environment",
