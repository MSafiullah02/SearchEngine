SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). This is a plus-stranded RNA virus with an approximately 30 kb long genome encoding replicase gene products and the structural proteins containing spike, envelop, membrane and nucleocapsid (Groneberg et al., 2005). Although the viral receptor has been identified (Li et al., 2003b), the pathogenesis of SARS remains poorly understood and the apparent latency of SARS-CoV in animal reservoirs continuously provides us a serious threat of reemergence.",

            "text": "Spike protein of SARS-CoV is a major target for neutralizing antibodies because this protein interacts with the cellular receptor (Li et al., 2003b). High titers of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected in sera of the recovered patients (Li et al., 2003a), and humoral immunity induced by a DNA vaccine contributed to the protection against SARS-CoV challenge in mice (Yang et al., 2004). These data strongly suggest that neutralizing antibodies play a central role in the clearance of SARS-CoV. On the other hand, a rapid loss of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in patients suffering from severe SARS, and the cell counts gradually returned to normal ranges as the patients recovered (Tang et al., 2003). Furthermore, certain HLA class I alleles have been reported to correlate with SARS susceptibility (Lin et al., 2003, Ng et al., 2004), suggesting that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in the elimination of SARS-CoV as well. Several CTL epitopes have been identified from spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV (Wang et al., 2004a, Wang et al., 2004b, Chen et al., 2005, Tsao et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2006, Ohno et al., 2009). However, CTL epitopes have not been found in non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV. In general, non-structural proteins are more conserved and synthesized earlier than structural proteins, and therefore, they could be preferable as an antigenic target for CTLs.",

However, the immunogenicity of this type of vaccine is very weak. Liposomes have extensively been investigated as a delivery system for antigen (Alving et al., 1995). In most cases, it has been prepared by antigen entrapment within the aqueous lumen of liposomes. In contrast, we have previously demonstrated that an ovalbumin (OVA)-derived peptide, OVA257-264 conjugated on the surface of liposomes induced OVA257-264-specific CTLs in mice more effectively than did liposomes containing OVA257-264 inside (Taneichi et al., 2006, Nagata et al., 2007). Furthermore, we have recently shown that surface-linked liposomal peptides derived from nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV effectively induced SARS-CoV-specific CTLs in mice (Ohno et al., 2009). These data suggest that liposomes would become an excellent adjuvant vehicle for a synthetic peptide vaccine when a peptide(s) is chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes.",

There are several reasons why we focused on this protein. First of all, pp1a protein is a regulatory protein, and hence, more conserved and synthesized earlier than spike and nucleocapsid proteins (Groneberg et al., 2005). Second, since pp1a is a largest protein composed of 4382 amino acids among SARS-CoV-associated proteins (Groneberg et al., 2005), it is more likely to find highly immunogenic, dominant epitopes in pp1a protein than in any other proteins of SARS-CoV. Peptides identified were then chemically conjugated on the surface of liposomes and evaluated for their abilities to induce SARS-CoV-specific CTLs.",

Ice-cold acetone (100 ml) was added in drops and kept on ice for 30 min to precipitate. Crystals were collected and dissolved in 5 ml of chloroform. After evaporation, 34.4 mg of DOPE-DSS was obtained. For preparation of unsaturated liposomes, DOPE-DSS (0.03 mM), dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (0.18 mM), cholesterol (0.21 mM), and dioleoyl phosphatidyl glycerol (0.06 mM) were dissolved in 10 ml of chloroform/methanol.

However, numbers of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells varied among these liposomal peptides (Fig. 3), suggesting a variety of immunogenicity. In particular, Lip-pp1a-3709 was most effective for the induction of peptide-specific IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, Lip-pp1a-2207 and Lip-pp1a-3444 marginally elicited IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells, and Lip-pp1a-3687 failed to induce IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells in mice. To further assess immunogenicity of the liposomal pp1a peptides, three known CTL epitopes derived from SARS-CoV spike protein, Spike-978, -1167 and -1203 (Wang et al., 2004a, Wang et al., 2004b) were conjugated on the surface of liposomes (Lip-Spike-978, -1167, and -1203), and were compared to the pp1a-derived peptides for their induction of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8+ T cells. As shown in Fig. 3, high percentages of IFN-\u03b3+ cells within CD8+ T cells were detected in mice immunized with Lip-Spike-1203. However, this liposomal peptide was likely to be slightly less effective than Lip-pp1a-3709 in the induction of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3). On the contrary, either Lip-Spike-978 or Lip-Spike-1167 did not elicit IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in mice (Fig. 3).",

CD8+ T cells were then analyzed for their peptide-induced expression of intracellular IFN-\u03b3. In both of the cases, the total numbers of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells per mouse spleen were slightly increased at day 3 after immunization, rose to a peak at day 7, and gradually decreased as days went by (Fig. 6A and B). As shown in Fig. 7\n, IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells were still detected in mice 75 days after immunization with any of the two liposomal peptides. These results demonstrate that immunization with these liposomal peptides generated long-lasting memory CTLs. Especially, the frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells in mice injected with Lip-pp1a-3709 was quite high (Fig. 7), indicating that Lip-pp1a-3709 may be an excellent vaccine candidate.",

As shown in Table 1, 30 peptides were selected as potential CTL epitopes using SYFPEITHI (Rammensee et al., 1999) and BIMAS (Parker et al., 1994). Out of them, only nine peptides could significantly induce IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells in mice (Fig. 2). Furthermore, there was not always a good correlation between peptides identified by the algorithms and their activity in the biological assays. For instance, pp1a-2340 and pp1a-3709 showed relatively inferior scores in BIMAS (Table 1), whereas both peptides stimulated good CTL responses (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). Thus, currently available algorithms have limited accuracy to find actual epitopes (Chentoufi et al., 2008), However, they are still quite useful because we can easily choose a cluster of promising peptides within a huge protein such as pp1a on the programs. Multiple immunological screenings have been advanced to validate predicted CTL epitopes. When used individually, each screen is not sufficient for identifying actual epitopes. However, various combinations of these screens are usually successful (Chentoufi et al., 2008, Ohno et al., 2009). Therefore, we performed multiple screenings, including cell surface stabilization of HLA-A*0201 molecules on T2 cells, detection of antigen-driven IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells, and functional in vivo and in vitro CTL assays.",

In HHD mice, the innate H-2Db and mouse \u03b22m genes have been disrupted by homologous recombination, and therefore, the only MHC class I molecule on the cell surface, HLA-A*0201, is efficiently utilized by HLA-A*0201-restricted CTLs. As a consequence, six peptides conjugated on the surface of liposomes significantly induced IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3), and seven liposomal peptides including the six peptides primed CTLs showing peptide-specific killing activities in mice (Fig. 4). However, it has to be taken account that there may be differences between the immunogenic variation observed in HLA class I transgenic mice and that in humans primarily because the antigen processing, presentation and ultimately, immunodominance may differ between them. In fact, it was shown that several HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes derived from human papillomavirus were not processed in HDD mice although these epitopes were naturally processed in HLA-A*0201+ humans (Street et al., 2002), indicating that cross-species incompatibility in antigen-processing and presentation machinery skews the presentation of some CTL epitopes.",

To this end, we generated an HLA-A*0201 positive C1R-A2-pp1a cell line in substitution for SARS-CoV-infected target cells because it is quite difficult to obtain live SARS-CoV in Japan. C1R-A2-pp1a cells carry the multiepitope minigene that encodes nine predicted epitopes with several natural flanking amino acid residues at the N and C termini of each epitope (Fig. 1). The basic idea to utilize flanking amino acids (Fig. 1) comes from the observation that flanking amino acid sequences modulate antigen processing of CTL epitopes (Le Gall et al., 2007). In fact, it was shown that several mutations at N-terminal (Draenert et al., 2004, Milicic et al., 2005) and C-terminal (Allen et al., 2004, Milicic et al., 2005) flanking residues of CTL epitopes disrupt proteasomal processing of HIV Gag and Nef proteins. Therefore, addition of flanking amino acid sequences allows natural antigen processing of CTL epitopes in C1R-A2-pp1a cells. As shown in Fig. 5, CTLs induced by seven liposomal peptides recognized HLA-A*0201 positive C1R-A2-pp1a cells. These data indicate that the seven peptides are naturally processed epitopes. As a matter of course, it will be necessary to examine whether pp1a-derived peptides can induce protective CTLs using SARS-CoV at the final screening.",

To our knowledge, however, the current study is the first report to demonstrate CTL epitopes derived from a non-structural protein of SARS-CoV such as pp1a protein. In fact, several liposomal peptides derived from pp1a induced high frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3) in comparison with liposomal peptides derived from nucleocapsid which we have recently published (Ohno et al., 2009). In particular, Lip-pp1a-3709 turned out to be most effective in the induction of antigen-driven IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3), indicating that pp1a-3709 is a highly immunogenic, dominant CTL epitope.",

It is noteworthy that long-lasting memory CTLs were detected in mice 75 days after immunization with liposomal peptides (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the surface-linked liposomal peptide may be an effective tool for CTL-based immunotherapy against infectious diseases such as SARS. The surface-linked liposomal peptide might be similar to the lipopeptide, a form of palmitoyl-lipidated peptide that is currently under intense investigation as human vaccines (Zhu et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2009). Although both effectively induce peptide-specific CTLs, there are several differences between them. The lipopeptide is self-adjuvanting to stimulate peptide-specific CTLs via Toll-like receptor (TRL)-2 (Zhu et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2009), but the surface-linked liposomal peptide requires external TLR ligands such as CpG (Nagata et al., 2007). However, CpG causes toxicity in humans (Davila et al., 2003), and hence, it is essential to find out a safe adjuvant for clinical use of liposomal peptides. On the other hand, the lipopeptide alone without a CD4+ T-cell epitope failed to induce CTL-based protective immunity, whereas a helper peptide is not necessary for the surface-linked liposomal peptide to induce peptide-specific CTLs.",
