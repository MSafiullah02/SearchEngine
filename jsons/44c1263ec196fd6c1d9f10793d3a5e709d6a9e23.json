Acute and chronic GVHD did not differ between groups. Adjusted probabilities of 1-year survival were 73% (95% 60 -84) and 91% (95% CI 86 -94) with cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved grafts, respectively.

Although 68% of patients receiving cryopreserved bone marrow grafts had \u22653 x 10 8 /kg TNC harvested, only 26% had that number infused. This loss of cells may have resulted in the observed differences in outcomes. The difference between TNC at harvest and infusion implies cryopreservation/thaw process is associated with cell loss. However, there may be other unmeasured or unknown factors that also resulted in the observed differences in outcome. We do not have data on cell function at any time point. An earlier report on the functional assay of cryopreserved bone marrow suggests preservation of cell function although that report included only 7 grafts. 21 An analysis of non-cryopreserved bone marrow cellular subsets for unrelated donor transplantations failed to show an effect of graft composition on hematopoietic recovery or survival although that report included only 7 patients with aplastic anemia. 22 All cryopreserved peripheral blood grafts in the current analysis had CD34+ doses greater than 2 x 10 6 /kg, the recommended minimum dose for severe aplastic anemia. 23 A subset analysis limited to recipients of peripheral blood was consistent with the findings of the main analysis. Cryopreserved CD34+ cells from peripheral blood are reported to have significant loss of membrane integrity, viability, and CFU potential that collectively could contribute to the adverse effect of transplantation of cryopreserved peripheral blood in our study. 23 We hypothesize that several factors led to the poor outcomes after transplantation of cryopreserved grafts. Optimizing cell dose is desirable but a controlled study that examines for changes in graft composition with cryopreservation/thaw that is specific for aplastic anemia is needed. A detailed analysis of the composition and function of cryopreserved grafts is beyond the scope of this study. We did not observe statistically significant differences in neutrophil and platelet recovery despite lower rates of recovery after transplantation of cryopreserved grafts.",

If a delay is not possible, careful assessment of the risk of cryopreservation versus the risk of not receiving the graft when it is needed is necessary. The NMDP/Be The Match considers the diagnosis of aplastic anemia a valid reason to try to deliver a fresh graft for unrelated donor transplants for severe aplastic anemia. Figure 1A . The 1-year graft failure for cryopreserved and non-cryopreserved transplants was 19% (95% CI 10 -31) and 10% (95% CI 6 -14), respectively Figure 1B .

ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing barriers to the collection and transport of donor cells, it is often necessary to collect and cryopreserve grafts before initiation of transplant conditioning. The effect on transplant outcomes in non-malignant disease is unknown. This analysis examined the effect of cryopreservation of related and unrelated donor grafts for transplantation for severe aplastic anemia in the US during 2013-2019.",

NMDP now requires that grafts be delivered and cryopreserved at the transplant center before initiation of transplant-conditioning regimen for any patient intended to undergo unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), in the absence of unique considerations. 2 Many transplant centers also instituted a similar practice for related donor HCT since related donors face many of the same issues as unrelated donors. The use of cryopreserved grafts introduces more flexibility and has occurred sporadically for several decades, although to our knowledge the practice has been ad hoc. 3 Several reports examined the effect of transplantation of cryopreserved grafts for hematologic malignancy, including one done very recently by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), in response to the need for information during the COVID-19 pandemic. None showed a difference in survival. 4-7 To our knowledge, there are no reports of outcomes after transplantation of cryopreserved related or unrelated donor graft for non-malignant hematologic diseases.",
