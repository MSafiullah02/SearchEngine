            "text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting millions of individuals worldwide, making it one of the most common monogenetic diseases. Sickle cell anemia, the most common and severe form of SCD, occurs in patients with a single amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for valine in the \u03b2-globin gene, resulting in an abnormal hemoglobin form called hemoglobin S (HbS) within the erythrocytes. Mutant HbS has reduced solubility when deoxygenated compared to normal hemoglobin A (HbA), leading to polymerization and aggregation of sickle erythrocytes in the microvasculature. Structural abnormalities and cumulative damage to the cellular membrane of sickled erythrocytes results in hemolysis and the development of chronic hemolytic anemia, as well as vaso-occlusion\nand multiorgan pathology. Compound heterozygosity of HbS with other \u03b2-globin gene mutations results in additional types of SCD, such as hemoglobin SC or hemoglobin S-\u03b2-thalassemia [1]. Despite significant improvements in the life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease, estimates of the median age at death range from 42 to 53 years for men and 48 to 58.5 years for women [2, 3].",

Deoxygenated HbS polymerizes and aggregates inside erythrocytes, forming rigid, sickled cells. The abundance of polymerized HbS is strongly influenced by both the level of deoxygenation and the concentration of intracellular HbS [4], and determines the severity of SCD [5]. Pathologic sickled erythrocytes have increased adherence to the vascular endothelium, leading to microvasculature occlusion and subsequent multiorgan damage. Vaso-occlusion often manifests as episodic pain crises in SCD patients, a disease hallmark, as well as a high frequency of acute chest syndrome (ACS) [2, 6]. Due to chronically low Hb levels in SCD, patients rely on an overproduction of erythrocytes. Acute splenic sequestration and infectious and inflammatory processes, such as ACS, can interfere with erythropoiesis and trigger reticulocytopenia, or \u201caplastic crisis\u201d in patients.",

Reduction in NO disrupts vascular homeostasis, leading to endothelial dysfunction, proliferation of cells within the vascular wall, thrombosis, and inflammatory stress [8\u201311]. Ischemia-reperfusion injury at sites of vessel occlusion can also promote inflammation and oxidative stress [12\u201315].",

Both acute and chronic pulmonary complications occur commonly in SCD and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among these patients [2, 16\u201318]. Acute complications of SCD include asthma and ACS, while chronic complications can include pulmonary hypertension, restrictive lung disease (fibrosis), and corpulmonale [8, 19, 20]. In the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) [21], a prospective, multi-institutional study of 3764 patients, over 20 % of adults with SCD likely had fatal pulmonary complications [2]. In another long-term, follow-up study of 299 SCD patients who participated in the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH), pulmonary complications were found to account for 24 % of deaths [22]. Though these results demonstrate the increasing recognition of pulmonary disease in SCD, there remains an imperative need for improved mechanistic understanding of these disease processes and novel therapeutic strategies.",

Fat embolization can be diagnosed by the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from ACS patients [32\u201334]. However, due to the requirement of bronchoscopy, this method is not routinely performed and the true incidence of embolization is unknown. Since chest and rib pain are common manifestations of SCD, non-sickle pulmonary conditions such as fat embolism can be difficult to diagnose.",

These events occurred in patients with higher platelet counts and lower hemolytic rates during ACS, suggestive of in situ thrombosis. It is important to note that other causes of ACS, including infection and fat or bone emboli, as well as hypoxemia, may contribute to the development of pulmonary thrombosis in ACS.

While most cases are self-limited, some progress rapidly to acute respiratory failure with high rates of morbidity and mortality [41]. Overall mortality is 3 % in all ACS patients and 9 % in adults [6]. ACS therefore requires rapid management to prevent clinical decompensation and death. Recent increased awareness, the chronic use of hydroxyurea, and the aggressive use of early transfusion therapy, collectively, have led to a decrease in ACS-related mortality [42].

Rates of ACS are positively correlated with non-vaso-occlusive crisis, steady-state white blood cell counts and Hb concentration and inversely correlated with fetal Hb (HbF) levels [28]. Though higher steady-state Hb levels are associated with ACS, during acute hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis, the development of ACS is often preceded by an abrupt drop in Hb levels (mean decrease of 0.78 g/dL from steady-state levels) and increases in markers of hemolysis, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [6, 27]. A drop in platelet count also has been shown to precede ACS, with levels <200,000 cells/mm3, and is an independent predictor of neurologic complications during hospitalization and need for mechanical ventilation [6, 45]. Understanding the epidemiology and complex etiologies of ACS in SCD, which differ among age groups, is critically important to diagnosing and treating this devastating disease manifestation.",

Since the development of ACS often occurs 24\u201372 h after the onset of severe vaso-occlusive pain symptoms, it is critical that vigilance be kept during hospitalization of SCD patients, as they may be in the prodromal stages of ACS [25]. A thorough history and physical exam is required for all patients with SCD who present clinically with suspected signs of ACS, along with assessment of vital signs including oxygen saturation. Respiratory rate, pulse rate, and body temperature values have been shown to be higher in children than adults with ACS [36]. Patients with evidence of oxygen desaturation should have arterial blood gas measurements obtained to confirm the hypoxia [46], since pulse oximetry can be inaccurate in the presence of significant anemia. It is important to note that hypoventilation due to pain crisis or over-sedation can contribute to hypoxemia and exacerbation of ACS.",

However, another large, multicenter study found similar radiographic findings between adults and children with ACS [6, 36].

As mentioned above, an abrupt decrease in Hb concentration and platelet number often precede the development of ACS and are markers of disease severity [6, 45]. Reticulocyte counts can be used to assess for adequate bone marrow function and exclude red cell aplasia due to erythrovirus B19 infection [48]. ACS is associated with a systemic inflammatory state, with a mean peak temperature of 38.9 \u00b0C during hospitalization and a mean WBC count of 23,000 cell/mm3 [6]. Biochemical testing for C-reactive protein (CRP) can be useful in monitoring the inflammatory state of ACS patients, especially given the risk of multiorgan failure syndrome (discussed below), though the sensitivity and specificity of this test may be decreased if an infectious agent is present. Elevation in secretory phospholipase A2, a potent inflammatory mediator, occurs early in the course of ACS, before radiographic changes are detected, and has been shown to predict ACS onset [49].",

The similar presentation of multiorgan failure syndrome and ACS demonstrates a shared underlying etiology, with ACS predominantly affecting the lung [50]. Since the clinical manifestations of pulmonary fat embolization can be indistinguishable from other ACS causes, the diagnosis requires the identification of lipid-laden alveolar macrophages using Oil Red O staining (Fig. 4.2c). Bronchoscopy with BALF collection can be used for diagnosis, including identification of bacterial and viral agents, however this technique has been associated with an increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation [6]. A significant correlation between results from the bronchoscopy method and induced sputum sampling of alveolar macrophages has been reported, and ACS patients with the presence of lipid-ladenalveolar macrophages in induced sputum have more extra-thoracic pain, neurological symptoms, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminase levels [51].",

Pneumonia cannot be distinguished clinically from ACS, therefore empirical antibiotic therapy is administered upon presentation. Pulmonary emboli originating from deep vein thrombosis are difficult to distinguish from in situ pulmonary thrombi or fat or bone marrow emboli occurring frequently in ACS, which do not respond to anti-coagulation therapy [24, 29]. Signs and symptoms of vaso-occlusive pain crisis and evidence of new pulmonary radiographic densities can assist in ruling out pulmonary embolus. Testing for D-dimers is unhelpful in SCD patients due to basally elevated levels [55]. ACS symptoms along with the detection of deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities by ultrasound imaging, recent surgery, or extended periods of immobility suggest the presence of pulmonary emboli.",

One large study found an increase in PaO2of 8 mmHg and increase in SaO2 of 3 % following transfusion in ACS patients, with an even greater improvement in SaO2 in patients who had demonstrated hypoxia prior to transfusion [6]. The oxygenation benefits of transfusion are due to a left-shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves, which is usually right-shifted at baseline in SCD due to the presence of HbS. Sickle-negative, leukocyte-depleted packed RBCs with extensive matching to Rhesus D, C, and E, as well as Kell antigens should be used for transfusion [58]. Since SCD patients often receive transfusions for many acute and chronic complications throughout the course of their disease, there is a risk for iron overload and alloimmunization.

Simple RBC transfusion decreases the concentration of HbS by dilution, and should be considered in more stable patients with single-lobe involvement, mild hypoxemia responsive to low-flow oxygen, and worsening anemia [58]. Exchange transfusion performed by automated erythrocytapheresis can rapidly reduce the percentage of HbS without the risks of iron overload or hyperviscosity, but the risk of alloimmunization remains. This modality is often reserved for ACS patients with multilobar involvement, refractory hypoxemia, and imminent or rapidly progressing lung injury, or in less severe patients with high Hb concentrations (\u22659 g/dL) to avoid hyperviscosity [58]. It has been demonstrated that conservative transfusion regimens are as effective as aggressive regimens in preventing perioperative complications in SCD, with the conservative regimen resulting in significantly fewer transfusion-associated complications [59].

As previously discussed, there are several important risk factors influencing the need for invasive MV in ACS. These include platelet counts less than 200,000 cells/mm3 (likely indicative of the fat embolization syndrome), the number of lobes involved on chest radiography, and a self-reported or medical record history of cardiac disease [6]. The complications of heart disease are now thought to reflect the presence of occult pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, as a recent study in 84 patients hospitalized with ACS found that 13 % manifested right heart failure [17]. Strikingly, this patient subgroup had the highest need for invasive MV and death, suggesting that pulmonary hypertension and right heart dysfunction is a major comorbidity during ACS.",

Hydroxyurea has been shown to decrease the incidence of vaso-occlusive pain crises in SCD and reduce the risk ACS development by approximately 50 % when administered in the outpatient setting, and may also prevent splenic dysfunction, cerebral-artery damage, and secondary stroke [61, 62]. Importantly, hydroxyurea also significantly reduces the need for transfusion therapy and has been demonstrated to reduce overall mortality by 40 % in SCD. The beneficial mechanisms of hydroxyurea include increasing the number of RBCs containing high levels of HbF, (via stimulation of soluble guanylatecyclase and killing of cycling cells through inhibition of ribonucleotidereductase), as well as decreasing RBC membrane damage, sickling and vaso-occlusion [62] (Fig. 4.3). These factors can result in a significant reduction in ischemia, necrosis, hemolysis, and vascular damage. Given the known teratogenic effects of hydroxyurea, patients should not be treated during pregnancy or breast-feeding, and contraception should be used in patients receiving therapy. Before initiation of hydroxyurea therapy, baseline measures of complete blood counts, hepatic function, and renal function should be established to determine appropriate dosing. The myelosuppressive effects of hydroxyurea therapy should also be monitored with routine peripheral blood counts, and dose adjustment should be made as needed [62].\n",

In addition to the described acute care strategies for ACS, several preventative measures may be employed in these patients. Hydroxyurea therapy is recommended for adult SCD patients with a history of ACS or frequent vaso-occlusive pain episodes, unless otherwise contraindicated, as described above [62]. In patients with multiple moderate to severe ACS episodes despite maximal hydroxyurea therapy, the use of chronic transfusion therapy to maintain a low percentage of RBCs containing HbS has been shown to decrease the rate of ACS and vaso-occlusive pain crises in SCD [63]. Careful risk-benefit assessments must be made in patients considered for chronic transfusion given the association of this therapy with a wide variety of adverse reactions. Myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation, currently the only cure for SCD, may be recommended for patients with severe symptoms that are unresponsive to hydroxyurea therapy or have a history of ACS and have a HLA-matched sibling available as a donor [64]. Despite the potentially curative outcome of transplantation in SCD, there is an associated risk of mortality of 7\u201310 % and relatively few studies done to address patient selection and criteria for transplant. The use of alternative donor sources and non-myeloablative transplant regimens are currently under investigation, but their utility in ACS remains uncertain.",

New England Journal of Medicine. 2008;358(13):1362\u20139. [PMID: 18367739]). Mutations within the \u03b2-globin gene in sickle cell disease result in the production of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) within red blood cells (RBCs). Most RBCs produced in the bone marrow are derived from mature precursor cells and contain mostly HbS. Deoxygenation conditions induce HbS polymerization and morphological sickling of RBCs within the circulation, leading to pathologic vaso-occlusion and acute chest syndrome. HbS damages the RBC membrane through several mechanisms resulting in hemolysis, depletion of nitric oxide, and increased adherence to and damage of vascular cells. Hydroxyurea therapy induces \u03b3-globin gene expression and can kill cycling cells, forcing more RBCs called F-cells to be produced, which are derived directly from primitive progenitor cells and contain high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) content. This can reduce pathologic RBC membrane damage, vaso-occlusion, ischemia, and necrosis. Hydroxyurea also produces nitric oxide, which may help to regulate vascular tone, and directly stimulates HbF production. Overall, hydroxyurea therapy leads to fewer symptoms in patients, less severe hemolytic anemia, fewer cases of acute chest syndrome, and lower mortality",
