With our letter we wish to complement the article and elaborate more in the chest imaging in COVID-19. Although most of the radiological findings presented in these patients are generic and can be seen in many systemic infectious processes such as pneumonia (viral or bacterial), inflammatory conditions (inflammatory lung diseases, vasculitis) and cardiac etiologies affecting lung parenchyma such as decompensated congestive heart failure, early recognition and high index of suspicion is of paramount importance.",

These can range from ground glass opacities (GGOs) to dense consolidations. At this point there is limited evidence to state that denser or more confluent radiological lung involvement is linked to worse clinical outcomes, but it is clear that the longer duration of illness is definitely linked to diffuse bilateral infiltrates with bibasilar distribution. 4, 7, 8 Even though the authors described this case as confirmed corona virus infection, they have omitted the important additional information about these patients such as underlying medical comorbidities, fluid status (volume overload), recent use of steroids and other concomitant infections (superadded pneumonia with corona virus infection).",
