            "text": "The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, the spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. We recently described a novel method to pharmacologically down-regulate the expression of target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulation of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data reveal the existence of a folding intermediate showing druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. Importantly, among the different virtual hits, we identified mefloquine, a quinoline-derivative belonging to a class of antimalaria agents (e.g. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) recently described for their effects on ACE2 maturation. Thus, our results suggest that these drugs could act against SARS-CoV-2 by altering the folding pathway of its receptor ACE2.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic started at the end of 2019 in the Hubei province of China and later spread to the rest of the planet [1] . The disease shows unprecedented transmission, morbidity and mortality rates [2, 3] . With vaccines still far from being available, effective therapeutics to control the disease are in urgent need. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the broad family of Coronaviridae, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of humans and animals causing pathologies ranging from a common cold to severe respiratory diseases, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [4] . Similarly to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four main structural proteins, known as the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) [5] . The latter promotes the first adhesion of the virus to host cells through direct interaction with extracellular domains of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [6] [7] [8] . Subsequently, another protein of the host, the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), cleaves the spike protein, exposing a fusion peptide that directly promotes virus entry into the cell [9] . ACE2 belongs to the protein family of angiotensin-converting enzymes [10] . The protein is reported to be expressed in cells of the kidney, intestine, arteries, heart, and lung, although discrepancies about its expression profiles in different organs recently emerged [11, 12] . The main function of ACE2 is connected to its ability to lower blood pressure by catalyzing the conversion of angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin [13] . The protein is a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases [14, 15] . Consistent with the mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, blocking the initial interaction of Spike with ACE2 should effectively counteract virus replication. This objective could be achieved by different strategies, including antibodies against Spike, compounds interfering with the Spike-ACE2 interaction, or molecules capable of lowering the exposure of ACE2 at the cell surface [16] . The latter strategy could overcome possible evolutionary variations of the virus conferring resistance to treatments directed against viral proteins. However, the function of ACE2 on vascular regulation has been shown to play protective roles against virus-induced lung injury, and the complete silencing of the protein would likely result in severe secondary effects [6, 17] . For this reason, any pharmacological approach aimed at targeting ACE2 should be able to down-regulate its expression rather than abrogating it. We have recently described an entirely novel method for selectively reducing the level of target proteins, called Pharmacological Protein Inactivation by Folding Intermediate Targeting (PPI-FIT) [18] . The technology is based on the concept of targeting folding intermediates of proteins rather than native conformations and is made possible by computational algorithms allowing the allatom reconstruction of folding pathways [18, 19] . The rationale underlying the PPI-FIT method is that stabilizing a folding intermediate of a protein with small ligands should promote its degradation by the cellular quality control machinery, which could recognize such artificially stabilized intermediates as improperly folded species. Here, we report the full atomistic reconstruction of the folding pathway of ACE2, which predicts the existence of a folding intermediate presenting two unique druggable pockets hidden into the native state. These pockets were employed as novel target sites for virtual screening campaigns aimed at repurposing compounds capable of modulating the expression of ACE2.",

            "text": "To obtain the all-atom reconstruction of the folding pathway of apo-ACE2, we employed the so-called Bias Functional approach (see Methods) [20] . This enhanced path sampling scheme requires to provide the protein native conformation, which was retrieved from PDB 1R42 (Figure 1 ). This structure includes the atomic coordinates of the catalytic domain of the enzyme (residues 19-615). The zinc ion in the active site, as well as the glycans, were both removed, due to uncertainties about their binding kinetics. The Charmm36m forcefield [21] was employed throughout the simulations. The native structure of ACE2 was employed to generate 32 denatured conformations by a combination of unfolding ratchet-and-pawl Molecular Dynamics (rMD) and high temperature MD simulations (see Methods). For each conformation, 40 trajectories were generated by folding rMD, for a total of 1280 trajectories. All the non-productive trajectories were discarded while folding trajectories of the remaining sets (N = 18) were ranked based on the value of their Bias Functional (Equation 5 in Methods). For each set, we selected the least biased trajectory (LBT), corresponding to the folding pathway with the highest probability to occur in the absence of biasing forces [20] . To gain information about the folding mechanism, we considered a specific collective variable R defined as a normalized linear combination of the fraction of native contacts (Q) and Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions from the native structure. According to our definition, R = 0 corresponds to the fully denatured state of the protein, while R = 1 to the native configuration. The 18 resulting least biased trajectories were employed to generate the transition path energy function G(R) defined in Methods. This quantity provides a lower bound to reaction limiting free-energy barriers that are overcome along the folding process. Therefore, it can be used to infer the existence of folding intermediates. Since the bias functional approach cannot be used to explore the dynamics within the reactant state, we restricted our analysis to the transition region R > 0.55, where significant tertiary-structure content begins to appear. This reactive section of the pathway contains two non-native metastable states, referred to as \"early\" and \"late\" intermediates ( Figure 2 ). The analysis of protein conformations along the trajectories led to the description of the complete folding mechanism for ACE2 ( Figure 3 ). The first event along the ACE2 folding pathway is the formation of three distinct regions (foldons) encompassing: (i) the two N-terminal \u03b1-helices (residues 19-82); (ii) the globular domain (residues 295-425) containing the zinc coordinating amino acids; (iii) the central core (residues 149-284 and 430-587), followed by the docking of the C-terminal tail (residues 589-615). These regions then sequentially fold onto each other, giving rise to the native state. ",

These structures were subjected to 50 ns of MD simulations at T = 310 K with position restrain on C\u03b1, to explore the conformational variability of the residues side-chains. Then, for each MD simulation, 200 structures, equispaced in time, were extracted and analyzed with the SiteMap [22] and DogSiteScorer [23] software. Pockets were then ranked based on a series of druggability descriptors (Supp. Table 1 ). This analysis identified two predicted druggable pockets, exclusively present in the ACE2 late intermediate state but not in the native conformation ( Figure 5 ). In particular, pocket 1 results from a local structural variation into the core region (residues 468-498), while pocket 2 results from the missing docking of the C-terminal tail onto the core region. To determine the reliability of each druggable site, we measured the number of folding pathways presenting the relevant structural variation underlying each pocket ( Figure 6 ). The least biased trajectories were projected on two graphs plotting the RMSD of each relevant region (residues 468-498 or C-terminal tail) against the RMSD of the corresponding docking site. These analyses revealed that the pocket 1 is present in a single trajectory, while the pocket is predicted to appear in 9 different trajectories.",

We built a unique collection of 9187 compounds by combining libraries of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and molecules at different stages of currently ongoing clinical trials (see Material and Methods). The chemical collection was screened against the two identified pockets by following a consensus virtual screening workflow ( Figure 7A ). Two different docking software, Glide [22] and LeadIT [24] , were employed in parallel to predict the binding affinity of each compound to the ACE2 folding intermediate pockets.Two different docking software, Glide [22] and LeadIT [24] , were employed in parallel to predict the binding affinity of each compound to the ACE2 folding intermediate pockets. Only compounds showing promising predicted affinity (i.e. Glide ds \u2264 -6 kcal/mol; LeadIT HYDE aff \u2264 50 \u00b5M) in both docking protocols were submitted to a third docking round based on AutoDock [25] . This process identified two consensus sets (AD LBE \u2264 -6 kcal/mol, AD NiC \u2265 25), including 145 compounds for pocket 1 and 238 for pocket 2. The top scoring compounds from Glide (Glide ds \u2264 -9 kcal/mol) and LeadIT (HYDE aff \u2264 5 \u00b5M) were also added to these sets. Finally, a visual inspection of binding mode and chemical similarity annotation for each ligand allowed the selection of 14 virtual hits for pocket 1 and additional 21 for pocket 2 (Supp. Table 2 ). Collectively, these results predicted 35 potential ligands for the ACE2 folding intermediate. Interestingly, among the selected hits, we identified mefloquine ( Figure 7B and 7C) , a quinoline analogue belonging to a class of anti-malaria agents recently reported to exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro. Of note, retrospective analysis of 7 additional members of the same chemical class (shown in Supp. Table 2) identified hydroxychloroquine, a drug currently in clinical trials for COVID-19, as a putative ligand for pocket 2 of the ACE2 folding intermediate.",

            "text": "Multiple pieces of evidence indicate that down-regulating the expression of ACE2 in the early stages of the SARS-CoV2 infection should effectively inhibit virus replication. However, selectively decreasing the expression of a target protein could be a difficult task. RNA silencing or CRISPR-based strategies represent valid options, but their use could be limited by delivery issues [26, 27] . These problems could be overcome by emerging pharmacological technologies like the proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which build on the principle of designing bi-functional compounds capable of interacting with the target protein with one side and engaging the E3 ubiquitin ligase with the other, leading to the degradation of the polypeptide by the proteasome [28] . Similarly, the PPI-FIT method capitalizes on the cellular quality control machinery to promote the degradation of the target polypeptide, although it does not require the development of bi-functional molecules. PPI-FIT-derived compounds aim at stimulating the removal of the target protein by directly blocking its folding pathway [18] . In this manuscript, we described the first step along with the application of the PPI-FIT paradigm to ACE2 by reporting the all-atom reconstruction of the folding pathway of the protein. Our analyses predict the existence of a folding intermediate showing two unique druggable pockets not present in the native ACE2 conformation. In order to respond to the urgent need for an effective therapy against SARS-CoV-2, we targeted both pockets by a in silico virtual screening approach aimed at repurposing compounds currently in clinical trials or already approved by the FDA. Interestingly, among the predicted ligands for pocket 2 we found the quinoline-derivative mefloquine. This drug belongs to a class of antimalaria agents recently described for their potential effect against SARS-CoV-2 [29, 30] . While the precise mechanism by which chloroquine and its more active derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit virus replication is not known, reports suggest that the compounds may act by reducing the glycosylation of ACE2 [31] . This evidence is highly consistent with a PPI-FIT-like effect of these drugs, which could alter the correct maturation of ACE2 glycosidic moieties by acting on the folding pathway of the protein. Based on our previous experience with the PPI-FIT technology, we anticipate that the possible down-regulating effects of our in silico predicted compounds targeting the ACE2 folding intermediate will be easily tested in cell-based assays by mean of standard biochemical techniques like western blotting.",

The capped protein structure was used to generate the receptor grid, with no scaling of Van der Waals radii for non-polar receptor atoms. The docking space was centered on the centroid of the residues defining the pockets (x: 75.4, y: 58.2, z: 67.6 for pocket 1; x: 50.8, y: 57.0, z: 69.1 for pocket 2). The docking space was defined as a 35 \u00c5 3 cubic box, while the diameter midpoint of docked ligands was required to remain within a smaller, nested 15 \u00c5 3 cubic box. Docking experiments were performed in the Glide standard precision mode using a 0.8 factor to scale the Van der Waals radii of the ligand atoms with partial atomic charge less than 0.15. For the BioSolveIT docking, LeadIT (version 3.2.0) was used for protein preparation and docking parameters definition. The binding site was defined on the basis of the residues composing the identified druggable pocket. The residue protonation states, as well as the tautomeric forms, were automatically assessed in LeadIT using the ProToss method, that generates the most probable hydrogen positions on the basis of an optimal hydrogen bonding network using an empirical scoring function. The virtual screening workflow was developed by using the KNIME analytic platform and the BioSolveIT KNIME nodes. Specifically, the workflow was organized as follows: (i) the Compute LeadIT Docking node was selected to perform the docking simulations of the \u223c11\u00b710 3 docking clients by using the FlexX algorithm [39] . Ten poses for each ligand were produced; (ii) the Assess Affinity with HYDE in SeeSAR node generated refined binding free energy and HYDE [40] predicted activity (HYDE aff ) for each ligand pose using the HYDE rescoring function; and (iii) for each ligand, the pose with the lowest HYDE aff was extracted. For AutoDock docking, ligands and receptor structures were converted to the AD4 format using AutoDockTools and the Gasteiger-Marsili empirical atomic partial charges were assigned. The dimensions of the grid were 60 X 60 X 60 points, with grid points separated by a 0.375 \u00c5. The grid was centered on the centroids of pockets 1 and 2. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used, and for each compound, the docking simulation was composed of 100 runs. Clustering of docked conformations was performed on the basis of their RMSD (tolerance = 2.0 \u00c5) and the results were ranked based on the estimated free energy of binding. The obtained poses were filtered based on the Glide docking score (Glide ds ), the HYDE aff and AutoDock ligand binding energy (AD LBE ) as well as on the number of clusters (AD NiC ). The consensus virtual screening workflow was applied for both pocket 1 and pocket 2 ( Figure 7A ). The best scored structures for the three software were visually inspected and selected based on their binding mode and predicted interactions. In addition, the top scoring compounds for Glide docking and SeeSAR rescoring [41] were also evaluated. In particular, the Glide set was generated following these criteria: Glide ds \u2264 -9 kcal/mol, giving rise to 97 molecules for pocket 1 and 30 for pocket 2. The SeeSAR set was instead defined by applying the following filters: (i) HYDE aff \u2264 5 \u00b5M; (ii) Ligand efficiency (LE) and lipophilic ligand efficiency (LLE) category from 1 to 4 (where 1 corresponds to favorable LE/LLE, 5 corresponds to unfavorable LE/LLE); (iii) Good ligand conformer quality, judged on the basis of torsional quality of the rescored pose rotamers and intramolecular clashes; (iv) no protein-ligand intermolecular clashes, giving rise to 89 molecules for pocket 1 and 205 molecules for pocket 2.",
