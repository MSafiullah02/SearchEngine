This approach was originally developed as a tool for \u2018functional and sequence-based analysis of collective microbial genomes contained in environmental samples\u2019 [12, 13]. Early metagenomic studies analyzing the genetic content of environmental samples yielded the identification of metabolic traits, the characterization of organisms and the discovery of new antibiotics and enzymes [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Metagenomic studies now encompass a wide scope of research fields including marine environmental research, plant and agricultural biotechnology, human genetics and diagnostics of human diseases. Accordingly, the number of metagenomics papers in peer-reviewed journals has increased greatly since 2002 (Figure 1a). The scope of applications for metagenomics will likely widen from environmental microbiome studies to routine clinical diagnostics for palliative care of patients, public health, industry and beyond.",

Since then, it has been used to survey viruses in numerous environments including freshwater, marine sediment, soil and the human gut. Figure 1b shows an overview of diverse areas where the metagenomic approach has been applied for virus discovery since 2002. The success of these studies relied upon the advances observed in the past decade in the area of sequencing technology and in bioinformatics. Although the fundamental concept of metagenomics has not changed, several technical advances have proven valuable for the discovery of previously unidentified, uncultured viruses. While metagenomics originally depended upon cloning for the analysis of double-stranded DNA genomes [17\u2022\u2022, 18, 19, 20\u2022], high-throughput sequencing technologies can now be applied to all types of genomes, including single-stranded DNA and RNA [21].",

In 1892, Ivanovski demonstrated the presence of infectious agents, coined \u2018virus\u2019 by Beijerinck in 1898, in filtrate of infected leaves passed through a Chamberland filter. This marks the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus [27] and the birth of a new era in virology. Until then, the field of virology was not clearly defined. The instrumentation, from the discovery of tissue culture to modern molecular biology methods, has shaped the field and helped to discover many viruses. Since the invention of the technique of tissue culture in 1907 and the propagation of poliovirus in animal cells in 1909, cultivation of viruses has remained the gold standard for virus discovery for over a century [28, 29, 30]. Despite the achievements made by the culture technique, several limitations have hindered the discovery and detection of viruses in routine laboratory settings. Virus propagation requires the development of controlled conditions that mimic the natural ecosystem shared between viruses and their hosts [31\u2022].",

The immune sera method has shown little value for virus discovery. The inoculation method, however, not only helped to identify novel viruses, but also was used as an immunization method to confer cross-protection against closely related viruses. Indeed, the cowpox-based inoculation developed by Jenner in 1796 was the first effective vaccine against an infectious disease. Nearly two centuries later, this strategy was used to eradicate smallpox. However, it is unlikely that Jenner's method would pass the scrutiny of modern ethical review boards for vaccine or virus discovery [34].",

Indeed, consensus sequences of previously known viruses have been used to identify novel viruses including highly divergent clades of human immunodeficiency virus [36], simian retroviruses [37, 38, 39, 40], and hepatitis E virus [41]. However, PCR using consensus primers based on previously characterized viruses have little or no value in detecting completely novel viruses. The microarray techniques were first introduced in 1995 to monitor the expression of multiple genes simultaneously [42]. For virus discovery, microarrays can be prepared with probes that hybridize known viral sequences and potentially novel viruses with sufficient sequence similarity. The method has been applied to detect a wide range of known viruses as well as novel highly divergent viral taxa [43]. Microarray screening has led to the identification and characterization of a novel gammaretrovirus, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), in prostate tumors [43, 44]. Subsequent studies did not confirm these initial findings [45, 46], which points to potential limitations of the method. Another example of a well-known virus discovered with microarrays is SARS-CoV, a highly divergent coronavirus discovered amid a worldwide outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [43]. Reproducibility of results between microarray tests is frequently poor [47].",

In early studies [17\u2022\u2022, 18, 19, 20\u2022], preliminary sample preparation involved shearing of DNA and cloning. These steps were required in order to obtain sufficient DNA given the low amount of viral DNA in environmental samples (\u223c10 \u03bcg/100 l of sea water). Because viral DNA often contains modified nucleotides and because some viral genes (e.g. holins and lysozymes) are toxic to cells, the DNA was randomly sheared to produce small fragments before cloning [17\u2022\u2022, 18, 19, 20\u2022]. The process of sample preparation has since been streamlined and the sequencing speed increased with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. The replacement of cloning with high-throughput methods has revolutionized metagenomics.",

Theoretically, any type of sample can be analyzed using the metagenomic approach, including seawater [65], blood [66], horse feces [67], stool [20\u2022, 68, 69, 70, 71], marine sediments [18], coral tissues [72, 73], and hot springs [74]. Because viral genomes are relatively short, bacterial or eukaryotic nucleic acids can severely interfere with the isolation and detection of viral DNA or RNA that typically represents only a small fraction. Thus, removal of non-viral nucleic acid is necessary [64\u2022\u2022, 75]. Homogenization, filtration and ultracentrifugation are often necessary to concentrate the viral particles present in the sample (Figure 2). To ensure that viruses are not lost during the virus preparation, epifluorescence microscopy with SYBR-gold staining is used on aliquots of samples obtained after the homogenization, filtration, and chloroform treatments to monitor the presence of VLPs [64\u2022\u2022].",

Development of the \u2018next-generation\u2019 sequencing platforms offered the combined advantages of speed, automation and high-throughput, thereby increased sequencing capabilities by a factor of 100 to a million relative to the Sanger technology.",

This platform was used for the identification of an uncharacterized mycovirus [85], Solenopsis invicta virus 3 [86], Merino Walk virus and a new arenavirus [87, 88], among others (Figure 1b). For sequencing, DNA is fragmented and ligated to biotinylated specific linkers. The complex DNA/linkers fragment is attached to streptavidin-coated beads that anchor the DNA inside a droplet of water and PCR reagents in oil emulsion. Each fragment is first amplified to produce the template for sequencing reaction. Sequencing is carried out by annealing primers to the linker portion of the template complex, followed by the incorporation of nucleotides by DNA polymerase, which facilitates the extension of the complementary DNA. The pyrophosphate released by this process is measurable by the production of light [89, 90]. The Roche 454 system measures the pyrophosphate released as the result of nucleotide incorporation during DNA synthesis mediated by DNA polymerase. The amount of light released is proportional to the intensity of the light signal captured by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which then converts light signals into digital data [91, 92]. A typical optimum run using a 454 pyrosequencer yields about one million reads with an average length of 350\u2013450 nucleotides, totaling about 0.4 gigabases.",

To ensure that bioinformatic analyses are performed only on high quality data, the reads are typically processed through a software pipeline to remove any background sequences including host and bacterial DNA that had not been removed by the filtration, chloroform, and DNase I treatments [97, 98, 99]. The resulting sequence reads are assembled with strict parameters to generate contigs, each made of sequences derived from the same organism quasi-species. Using a stringent assembly parameter is critical to avoid sequence chimerization. The contigs sequences are then compared to the Genbank non-redundant nucleotide database using BLAST [100] or USEARCH [101].

A typical human or environmental viral metagenome can contain between 60% and 99% unknown sequences (Figure 3) [17\u2022\u2022, 18, 20\u2022, 62, 66, 70, 71, 74, 84, 85, 86, 88, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123]. Factors contributing to this variation include the sample type, the length of the sequence reads, the homology search method (BLASTn, tBLASTx, etc.), the similarity threshold (E-value cutoff), the database and version of that database used for the homology searches (Figure 3b). Depending on how they are viewed, the unknowns can represent either a formidable challenge or a treasure trove for virus discovery. Although researchers often tend to consider the unknowns as \u2018junk,\u2019 these sequences could be a valuable blueprint for the discovery of novel viruses [112, 124, 125].

            "text": "A tentative solution is to compare the sequences between samples in order to at least gain some insight about the viral entities that are shared between them. A program such as PHACCS (PHAge Communities from Contig Spectra) can be used to assess the biodiversity of uncultured viral communities by mathematically modeling the community structure using the contig spectrum of metagenome assemblies [126]. This method was extended to assess cross-assemblies of reads from different samples [65], providing a homology-independent tool for the comparison of metagenomes with a high proportion of unknown sequences. Although PHACCS may provide a glimpse of the composition and difference between metagenomes, it has limited value for the characterization of novel viruses. Two tools can be used to predict whether unknown sequences are from bacteriophages undergoing lytic and lysogenic lifestyles. One such tool described by Deschavanne et al. [127] compares the genome signatures of query sequences against those of their host genome in order to identify host\u2013phage relationship and information about the phage lifestyle. The second method, PHACTS, depends on residual homology between the putative unknown sequence and sets of randomly selected viral proteins from known viruses (K McNair et al., PHACTS: a computational approach to classifying the lifestyle of phages, unpublished data). Alternatively, viruses may be classified by basic sequence properties. For instance, the circularity of the contig, its oligonucleotide profile [128], and the open reading frame (ORF) structure (S Akhter et al., PhiSpy: A novel algorithm for finding prophages in bacterial genomes that combines similarity-based and composition-based strategies, under review) may all provide clues whether the unknown sequence could be from a potential novel virus. These properties can be combined into a prediction network used to classify viruses into lifestyle groups or taxonomic clades.",

            "text": "Although newly discovered viruses are often labeled \u2018novel,\u2019 the question remains whether these sequences represent truly novel viruses or ancient viruses that simply have never been observed before. The age of a sequence has traditionally been determined by multiple alignments of query sequences with their homologs and by calculating the divergence times from a common ancestral node on a phylogenetic tree. Dates can be estimated using either a molecular clock [129] or by assigning a calibration date to a specific node in the tree based on fossil or other evidence [130, 131, 132]. For viral metagenomic sequences, however, building a phylogenetic tree is itself problematic because often the sequenced reads may represent non-overlapping subregions of an unknown viral genome. Moreover, there is no fossil data available to calibrate the age of nodes in the tree. A promising approach might be to estimate divergence times from assembled viral contigs. De novo assembly allows non-overlapping regions to be combined into a single consensus sequence. For a given molecular clock, SNP analysis of the contributing reads could provide an estimation of how long ago the sequenced reads diverged. Such estimates may be critical when addressing the question of the origin of a newly identified infectious agent.",

            "text": "Until recently, virus discoveries were made in the context of disease etiology. Thus, virus discovery studies were biased mainly because of the use of convenient samples available from patients. Because of the difficulties involved, the investment of efforts and resources required to isolate viruses often could not be justified outside the disease context. It is likely that the context of the diseases has also led to the misconception that all viruses are pathogenic. This dogma was challenged by the discovery of viruses such as Torque Teno virus (TTV) and hepatitis G virus (GBV-C), originally associated with post-transfusion hepatitis [53, 133, 134, 135], and then were subsequently shown be classical examples of viral commensals [136, 137]. The widely accepted notion that viruses act as obligatory pathogens is beginning to give way to the concept that viruses can be part of the normal flora of the human body. Considering their high abundance in the gastrointestinal tract, on skin and even in blood and lungs [138] it is unlikely that viruses could only be pathogenic without any benefits for their hosts. The abundance of viruses, particularly phages, in the lung \u2014 an environment previously thought to be sterile \u2014 may reflect their beneficial role in keeping bacterial populations in check [138]. The pathogenicity of the GBV-C has shifted to a more radical designation as a \u2018good\u2019 virus in cases of co-infection with HIV. Indeed, GBV-C has been associated with a more favorable prognosis for patients with HIV infection by slowing the progression to AIDS [139, 140]. Similarly, dengue virus, a known pathogen, has been shown to limit HIV-1 replication and to reduce the viral load [141]. These examples need to be taken into account when metagenomic approach is applied to virus discovery. The characterization of a novel virus can be easily achieved in silico with limited bioinformatics tools but the determination of causation may not always be trivial.",

Falkow [145\u2022\u2022] proposed the modified Koch's postulates which uses molecular methods to monitor the role played by genes in distinct bacterial virulence. To satisfy the revised molecular Koch's postulates, a strong association must be established between the phenotype or property under investigation and the pathogenic members of a genus or pathogenic strains of a species. The gene of interest should be found in all pathogenic members of the genus or species but be absent in nonpathogenic strains. At best, the nonpathogenic strains could carry the gene with critical mutations that could render the strain non-virulent. However, new molecular methods do not always distinctively characterize virulence genes and make a clear association with a disease of unknown etiology. This could be because genes can be expressed at different time-points during infection. Genes can be turned on and off and may require intrinsic factors in order to trigger the disease process.",

The metagenomic traits found in diseased patients can be monitored in healthy individuals exposed to the suspected infectious agent. Although this novel approach requires separation or isolation of remaining co-occurring disease candidates (Figure 4.3), it does not necessarily require the isolation of the pathogen in tissue culture or pure culture media unlike the original Koch's postulates.

Secondly, inoculating a healthy individual with a sample from a diseased subject must result in disease state (Figure 4.2). Differential metagenomic traits in step (1) recovered in the newly induced diseased subject may be the biomarker of the candidate etiological agent; and finally, selective inoculation of samples from the disease subject (in step 2) must induce disease in another healthy control subject if the metagenomic contains the trait associated with the etiological agent of the disease, or phenotype under investigation (Figure 4.3).

For example, Finkbeiner et al. analyzed samples from 12 children using metagenomics and identified a large number of known eukaryotic viruses as well as sequences from putatively novel viruses [112]. Another study identified a corona-like virus, the Human Cosavirus E1 (HcoSV-E1), in a child with acute diarrhea [150]. These initial studies identified promising viral candidates to establish the etiology in these cases of diarrhea. The 2009 pandemic of influenza A (2009 H1N1) provided proof of concept in that metagenomics was effective to rapidly characterize the full genome of the flu virus [151]. Using the metagenomic approach, Palacios et al. discovered an arenavirus in samples which had tested negative by culture, PCR, serology and a microarray assay using oligonucleotide probes from a wide range of infectious agents [87], suggesting a potential causative agent for unexplained cases of post-transplantation death. In another study, Towner et al. described a new Ebola virus responsible for an outbreak of a hemorrhagic fever in the District of Bindibugyo, Uganda [152].

Viral metagenomics surveillance is defined as the survey of the functional and taxonomic signatures representing the viruses normally circulating within that population in the absence of noticeable epidemics. In the event of a zoonotic outbreak, these functional and taxonomic signatures of the virome will likely show detectable shifts. Figure 5\nshows a hypothetical rank abundance curve for six viruses (a\u2013f).

Another approach would be to determine the normal virome, a background viral metagenome to refer to in case of an outbreak. Lessons learned from studies of bacterial microbial metagenomes suggest that different environments often have different microbial signatures [159], including the functional metabolic information, the nucleotide usage, proportion of different species. Disrupting key metabolic processes of an environment can lead to disruption of the balance in that ecosystem. Similarly, the viromes in different human populations in different locations may display functional profiles characteristic of their respective environment, lifestyle and viruses circulating in each region. The magnitude of disturbance of the virome profile will depend on the fitness and virulence of the newly introduced pathogens and the immune fitness of the host. The viral communities in two different metagenomes can be compared using XIPE [160]. This statistical approach was developed for comparing metagenomic sequences derived from samples collected from the Sargasso Sea and from acid mine drainage and was able to accurately predict the physiology, metabolic potential and ecology of each ecosystem [160].",
