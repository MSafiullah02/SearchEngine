The foals came from four different farms and showed signs of illness for 0 to three days before death (five cases) or euthanasia (two cases). Clinical signs included diarrhoea, depression, distended abdomen, shock, abdominal pain, teeth grinding and sudden death. Treatment included antibiotics (three cases) and flunixin meglumine (five cases).",

Within these areas were round or linear antimesenteric perforations. The necrotic areas were thin (1 mm) whereas the tissue between these bands was thicker than normal.",

In one case there were also several adhesions. In the areas of the duodenum where mucosa was present there was either moderate or severe villous atrophy with cellular infiltration or fibrosis of the lamina propria. Additional histological lesions included necrosis of lymphoid tissue of the Peyer's patches, large intestinal lymphoid nodules, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen in all foals examined (six). One foal with serosal adhesions near the bile ducts also had diffuse acute cholangiolitis and peribolular hepatitis, subacute pancreatis and acute erosive fibrinous inflammation of the large ducts. E scherichi coli was isolated from intestinal contents (two cases), peritoneal fluid (one case) and various other tissues (one case). Enterobucfer species and Proteus species were cultured from one foal and rotavirus from another. No equine herpesvirus, adenovirus or coronavirus was found in four cases examined.",
