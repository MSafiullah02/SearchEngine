After the HBV receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP)-mediated viral particle enters hepatocytes,2,3 the viral capsid is translocated to the nucleus. Then, the viral genomic relaxes and circular DNA (rcDNA) is released into the nucleus and converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA).4 The cccDNA functions as a minichromosome and four viral RNA species are transcribed: a 3.5 kb mRNA (pregenomic RNA), 2.4 kb mRNA (preS1 HBs RNA), 2.1 kb mRNA (preS2/S HBs RNA), and 0.7 kb mRNA (HBX RNA), which are initiated by different promoters but share the same poly-A tail. The viral proteins HBV e antigen (HBeAg), HBcAg, and P are encoded by the 3.5 kb RNA. A large surface protein is encoded by 2.4 kb RNA. Middle-sized and small surface proteins (HBsAg) are mainly encoded by the 2.1 kb RNA and HBX is encoded by the 0.7 kb RNA.5,6",

By examining the level of antigen to HBV in cells overexpressing ISGs, we identified sterile alpha motif domain-containing 4A (SAMD4A), the overexpression of which strikingly inhibited HBV replication. SAMD4A is a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Smaug, which was reported to be a posttranscriptional repressor regulating processes such as maternal RNA destabilization, the maternal-to-zygotic transition, and early embryo development.11 The sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain contained in SAMD4A is a highly conserved domain shown to bind directly to an RNA stem loop, which is also known as a Smaug recognition region (SRE).12 SAMD4A is involved in neuron RNA granule formation13 and translational repression in mammals.14,15 High levels of SAMD4A expression reduce the nuclear accumulation of CUGBP1 in myoblasts from DM1 patients.16 A screen of a mutant mouse library revealed that SAMD4A-defective mice have multiple developmental defects due to the dysregulation of mTOC1 signaling17 and mitogen-inducible gene 6 expression.18 However, the participation of SAMD4A in host defenses has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that SAMD4A and its homolog, SAMD4B, can inhibit HBV replication. This inhibition is mediated by the binding of SAMD4A to the SRE-like sequence located in viral RNA. We also showed the inhibition of HBV by SAMD4A/B and murine SAMD4 in mouse models, suggesting the in vivo relevance of the anti-HBV function of SAMD4 family members.",

A single clone that exhibits a high sensitivity to HBV (strain ayw, D type) infection was named HepG2-2B1 and was used in our experiments. It is well known that hundreds of ISGs are induced in response to IFN stimulation, but the degree of ISG upregulation varies among different cell lines.24 We compiled a list of 285 ISGs that were reported to be significantly induced in several cell lines and constructed lentiviral vectors to express each of them in the HepG2-2B1 cells before HBV challenge.25 The culture medium for each ISG-expressing HepG2-2B1 cell line was changed, the cells were collected 15 days post HBV infection (dpi) and the HBV level was determined by measuring the HBeAg level (Fig. 1a).",

Most ISGs had no or little effect on the propagation of HBV, as the level of HBeAg in the medium of these ISG-expressing cells was comparable with that of the control. Interestingly, several ISGs, including SAMD4A, Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), PML, ZAP, ISG20, MYD88, DDX3, and ZBP1, suppressed HBeAg production, suggesting that these ISGs are anti-HBV ISGs. Most of these proteins had been reported to have antiviral functions. ZBP1, also called DAI, is well-established as a cytoplasmic z-DNA sensor that can activate and amplify IFN signaling.26\u201328 PML functions directly on multiple kinds of virus proteins to limit virus replication.29\u201331 Moreover, some of these proteins are reported to directly inhibit HBV replication. The zinc finger protein ZAP recognizes the HBV terminal repeat region, degrades viral RNA and synergizes with multiple ISGs to mediate antivirus activity.32 IDO1, a tryptophan degradation enzyme, inhibits HBV by tryptophan deprivation to efficiently reduce the intracellular DNA level of the virus.33 ISG20 and MYD88 can directly bind to HBV RNA via different target sites and facilitate the decay of viral RNA,34,35 whereas DDX3 can inhibit HBV RNA reverse transcription.36 The inhibitory effect of MKX on HBeAg is most likely due to the toxicity it induces in HepG2 cells (data not shown). Most noticeably, SAMD4A was the protein that exhibited the highest inhibitory activity (more than 95%) on HBV in our screen (Fig. 1b), but its role in suppressing viral propagation has not been previously reported.",

It is known that HBV cannot infect HepG2 and Huh7 cells due to the low NTCP expression in these cell lines but can be produced if the virus replicon pTSMP-AD38 is transiently transfected into these cell lines. We found that SAMD4A overexpression reduced HBsAg and HBeAg in the HepG2 and Huh7 cells transfected with pTSMP-AD38 (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 1D).

We overexpressed SAMD4A in this cell line and detected profoundly inhibited HBV production (Supplementary Fig. 1E).

The SRE sequence bound by the Drosophila SAMD4A homolog Smaug was defined as a nonspecific stem with a 4- or 5 nt loop containing the CNGG or CNGGN sequence.39 We searched the sequence in the HBV genome and found two candidates located at 1195\u20131217 nt and 1296\u20131321 nt. The latter is known as a conserved HBV posttranscriptional regulatory element (HPRE), whereas there is no report on the 1195\u20131217 nt sequence (Fig. 4b). The 1195\u20131217 nt sequence is also conserved throughout all 61 HBV variants, for which sequence information is available. We named these two stem-loop SRE-like1 (1195\u20131217 nt) and SRE-like2 (1296\u20131321 nt), and examined whether these two stem loops were the target sites of SAMD4A. Each of them was cloned into the 3\u2032-UTR of GFP, as Drosophila Smaug-binding SRE is in the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Coexpression of the GFP reporter with or without SAMD4A in HEK293T cells revealed that neither stem-loop insertions influenced GFP expression, but SAMD4A coexpression led to decreased GFP expression in the cells with the plasmid containing SRE-like1 but not the plasmid containing SRE-like2 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 5C). The guanine at the third position in the loop was reported to bind directly to Smaug and a hydrogen bond may form between cytosine 1 and guanine 4 to maintain the structure of the stem loop.12 We mutated both cytosine 1 and guanine 3 and found that the mutant stem-loop could not be suppressed by SAMD4A, as indicated by the measured GFP fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5D). We generated an HBV replicon mutant by mutating cytosine 1 and guanine 4 in SRE-like1 and cotransfecting the expression plasmid with 3\u00d7 Flag-SAMD4A and the mutant HBV replicon into HepG2 cells. We immunoprecipitated SAMD4A and measured the viral RNA level in the precipitate. Viral RNA with a mutated SRE-like1 was not pulled down by SAMD4A (Fig. 4e) and the replication of the mutant virus was not suppressed by SAMD4A overexpression (Fig. 4f). Taken together, our data indicate that SRE-like1 is a functional SRE, and that the binding of SAMD4A to this SRE is required for SAMD4A to suppress HBV replication.",

            "text": "The HBV genome encodes four different mRNAs (Fig. 4b). To determine whether an SRE controls the expression of viral mRNA, we constructed expression plasmids driven by the CMV promoter to express each of the four HBV mRNAs together with or without SAMD4A in HepG2 cells. SAMD4A coexpression reduced the levels of the 3.5, 2.4, and 2.1 kb but not 0.7 kb viral RNA (Fig. 5a). It appears that SAMD4A selectively reduced the levels of the mRNA containing the SRE, regardless of whether the SRE was in the 3\u2032-UTR of the HBe, HBc, and HBs mRNA (3.5, 2.4, and 2.1 kb, respectively) or in the coding regions in the HBV P protein mRNA (3.5 kb). An SRE in the 3\u2032-UTR of the mRNA reduces gene expression. The aforementioned data suggest that the SRE might also reduce gene expression when it is in the coding region. To determine whether SRE can influence gene expression when it is in the 5\u2032-UTR or coding region, we used the GFP reporter system. We inserted an SRE into the 5\u2032-UTR or coding region of GFP and tested whether overexpression of SAMD4A affected the GFP expression (Supplementary Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 5E, F, SAMD4A suppressed the expression of the GFP with the SRE in the coding region but had no effect on the GFP reporter with SRE in its 5\u2032-UTR. Mutated SRE in the coding region also eliminated the SAMD4A-mediated suppression of GFP (Fig. 5c). Thus, viral proteins with SRE in the 3\u2032-UTR or coding region of its mRNA could be suppressed by SAMD4A.",

SAMD4A- and SAMD4A A280H-overexpressing HepG2-2B1 cells were infected with HBV followed by the addition of actinomycin D to block transcription; these cells were collected at different time points after actinomycin D treatment. The primer pairs used to target the common sequence of the four different viral RNAs were used in real-time PCR to quantitate total HBV mRNA. Overexpression of SAMD4A but not SAMD4A A280H shortened the half-life of the HBV mRNA (Fig. 5e). Facilitating the effect of SAMD4A in reducing the stability of the HBV mRNA, the viral mRNA degradation in the SAMD4A-KO cells was slower than that in the WT cells (Fig. 5f). As SAMD4A did not affect the transcription of the HBV mRNA, mRNA instability may be the cause of the reduction in HBV mRNA induced by SAMD4A. As the SAMD4A-mediated reduction in HBV mRNA is comparable to that of proteins (Fig. 1c, e), the promotion of HBV RNA degradation may be the major mechanism of SAMD4A-mediated HBV suppression.",

Consistent with previous research, both eIF4E and 4E-T were coimmunoprecipitated with SAMD4A in human cells, as were CNOT6 and CNOT8 (Fig. 6a). Although all the interactions were independent of the SAM domain (Supplementary Fig. 6A), deletion of the C-terminal portion abolished the interaction between SAMD4A and eIF4E or 4E-T, but not CNOT6 or CNOT8 (Supplementary Fig. 6B).",

The expression of SAMD4A decreased viral HBsAg levels in the transgenic mice (Fig. 7e).

Interestingly, the SAMD4A level in the healthy individuals was comparable to that in the HBV-infected patients, but the SAMD4B level was significantly elevated in the hepatitis B patients.

A deep literature search revealed that SAMD4A was identified in a screen of anti-Togaviridae virus factors, indicating that the viral suppression function of SAMD4A is not limited to HBV.25,46 It is highly likely that SAMD4A exhibits an inhibitory effect on all viruses with mRNAs that contains an SRE loop. The SRE sequence is conserved in HBV, suggesting that it may be essential for the viral life cycle. Several stem loops, such as the \u03b5 region and HPRE, were previously reported to be contained in HBV RNA, where it controls encapsidation and viral RNA nuclear export.47 Other anti-HBV factors, such as ISG20,34 RIG-I,48 DDX3,36 and MYD88,35 inhibit virus replication by targeting \u03b5 or HPRE. However, the antiviral ability of these factors may interfere with each other because all of them target \u03b5 or HPRE. The SRE loop in HBV RNA was revealed in this study and is the unique site targeted by SAMD4A. We showed that SAMD4A can recognize and degrade RNA containing the SRE motif in the 3\u2032-UTR or coding sequence but not in the 5\u2032-UTR, which is an important piece of information for the future identification of other SAMD4A-regulated RNAs.",
