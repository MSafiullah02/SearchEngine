Clinical microbiology laboratories worldwide have historically relied on phenotypic methods (i.e., culture and biochemical tests) for detection, identification and characterization of virulence traits (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes, toxins) of human pathogens. However, limitations to implementation of molecular methods for human infectious diseases testing are being rapidly overcome allowing for the clinical evaluation and implementation of diverse technologies with expanding diagnostic capabilities. Molecular methods have been increasingly exploited to diagnose classic and fastidious pathogens, since the advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Mullis and Faloona, 1987). Some infectious agents identified and largely characterized in the past two decades using molecular methods include; Hepatitis C virus (Choo et al., 1989), Tropheryma whipplei (Relman et al., 1992), Mycobacterium genavense (Bottger et al., 1992), Bartonella (previously Rochalimaea) henselae (Matar et al., 1993), Hantavirus (Sin Nombre virus) (Chapman and Khabbaz, 1994), Chlamydia pneumoniae TWAR agent (Kuo et al., 1995), Herpesvirus 8 (Huang et al., 1995), the SARS Coronavirus (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003), Metapneumovirus (Mackay et al., 2003), and Influenza A H1N1 (Renesto et al., 2000, Dawood et al., 2009).",

Despite these continuing advances, a microbial etiology remains to be defined in a number of cases of human disease that have epidemiological, clinical and/or histological features of infection. Worldwide populations are increasingly being put at risk for novel contagions, particularly zoonotic agents or bacterial pathogens carrying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes (Church, 2004). Broad application of highly sensitive molecular technologies to common infections is also revealing that these diseases are not mono-microbial as previously thought, but rather, due to a disorder in complex microbial communities.",

            "text": "The human microbiome comprises 100 trillion microbial cells, outnumbering the somatic cells in the body by at least an order of magnitude (Savage, 1977). It was suggested early on that in order to properly appreciate human biology the 30,000 genes encoded in the human genome must be placed in the context of the millions of genes encoded by our microbial counterparts that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, the genitourinary tract, the oral cavity, the nasopharynx, the respiratory tract, and the skin (Davies, 2001). The human microbiome project was designed to sequence 1000 novel bacterial reference genomes and the entire collective of microbial genomes from 250 healthy individuals (Turnbaugh et al., 2007, Peterson et al., 2009). A vast number of human commensal microbial species have yet to be identified and characterized. The composition of the human microbiota is unique and varies significantly between body sites. A recent study showed that 3.3 million non-redundant genes (150 fold greater than the human genome) were assembled from 1000 to 1150 distinct microbial species from 124 human gut samples (Qin et al., 2010). The diversity of the human microbiome is also affected by environmental factors, diet, and the host immune system (Ley et al., 2006). The essential role that commensal micro-organisms play in human health is becoming increasingly recognized for its functional involvement in normal development, nutrition, immune regulation and colonization resistance (Brook, 1999, Hooper, 2004, Mazmanian et al., 2005, Li et al., 2008, Clarke et al., 2010). There is also evidence accruing that the functional capacity of the human microbiome may be altered in patients with obesity and other chronic conditions (Qin et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Real-time PCR detection using probes is illustrated in Fig. 1\n(Heid et al., 1996). The targets are detected in real time from the sealed PCR plate and there is no post-PCR processing required (Whitcombe et al., 1998), therefore, the risk of false-positive results due to amplicon carryover is substantially decreased compared to conventional PCR (Barken et al., 2007). In addition, most real-time PCR formats offer the option of melting curve analysis so that the amplicon can be distinguished from nonspecific product or primer-dimers (Mackay, 2007, Tevfik Dorak, 2006). The performance of real-time PCR assays therefore has increased sensitivity and reliability of the reported results compared to those obtained by conventional PCR (Espy et al., 2006, Mothershed and Whitney, 2006, Procop, 2007). Real-time PCR assays can be designed to allow the detection and simultaneous quantification of the PCR products over a wide dynamic range of quantitative linearity, which is an important requirement of many diagnostic applications (Croagh et al., 2010, Itakura et al., 2011, Luft, 2011). Because real-time PCR assays are amenable to automation, most of these detection assays are run and completed in the clinical laboratory setting in a shorter time than conventional PCR, therefore providing a more rapid test cycle turnaround time. Real-time PCR has truly become \u2018walk-away\u2019 molecular testing in the clinical laboratory setting. Despite this benefit, cost is a limitation of implementation in smaller laboratories with limited resources because of instrument cost and the price of a single real-time PCR reaction including DNA extraction can be more than three times of the cost of conventional PCR (Mothershed and Whitney, 2006).",

            "text": "Nucleic acid sequencing has emerged as important tool for pathogen identification and discovery. Identification of human pathogens by partial or whole gene sequencing had not been widely adopted by clinical microbiology laboratories even a decade ago due to the labor and expense of bringing this technology in-house, the lack of standardized methods for conducting analyses, and interpreting the results. Prior to 2000, DNA target sequencing had been primarily used for identification of organisms that were difficult to identify by using conventional phenotypic methods or recover by cultivation (Woo et al., 2008, Pareek, 2011). DNA target sequencing for the rapid identification of bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens has since been increasingly implemented as a routine procedure by many clinical laboratories. In the last decade, DNA sequencing technologies have improved throughput capability and cost. Important guidelines have been published that provides interpretive criteria for identification of a wide range of clinically important bacteria and fungi to the species and genus levels (Petti et al., 2008a). Commercial software is available that provides a quality assured database of known bacterial and fungal sequences for human pathogens (SmartGene\u00ae IDNS, Lausanne, Switzerland) (Simmon et al., 2006). Some diagnostic laboratories also perform sequencing analysis of viral cDNA generated by reverse transcription (Fournier and Raoult, 2011).",

            "text": "Sanger-based sequencing technology remains the most commonly used method, although newer non-electrophoresis methods (i.e., pyrosequencing, ion-torrent sequencing) are increasingly being used for clinical applications because of their improved efficiency and decreased cost (discussed later). DNA target sequencing for routine identification utilizes conserved genes for both bacteria and fungi that have been widely used for taxonomic purposes (Bottger, 1989, Doolittle, 1999, Atkins and Clark, 2004, Petti, 2007). In bacteria, the rRNA genes (5S, 16S, and 23S) and their intergenic regions have been commonly used for taxonomic purposes. These genes are universally present, are only minimally affected by horizontal gene transfer and contain hypervariable regions flanked by high sequence conservation. These characteristics have made the 16S rRNA gene the most widely used region for bacterial taxonomy and identification (Doolittle, 1999). The sequence information obtained from the 5\u2032 portion of the 16S rRNA gene often provides sufficient data for identification purposes (Petti, 2007, Woo et al., 2008). Much of the data in public databases also correspond to this region of the 16S rRNA gene (e.g., GenBank). Occasionally, the entire 1540 bp region is required to distinguish between particular taxa or strains, or alternative DNA gene targets may also have to be interrogated because some species may share 99\u2013100% 16S rRNA sequence identities (Facklam, 2002, Janda and Abbott, 2002). Alternative gene targets for speciation have been used including recA, rpoB, tuf, gyrA, gyrB and cpn60 family proteins because of functionally conserved regions with intervening variability. In fungi, the eukaryotic rRNA gene complex consists of four ribosomal genes, 18S (small subunit), 5.8S, 28S (large subunit), and 5S genes. Within this region, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) (White et al., 1990) and an approximately 600 bp D1/D2 region of the 28S subunit (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1997) are the most phylogenetically variable regions and have been widely used for fungal taxonomy and identification (Atkins and Clark, 2004, Petti et al., 2008a).",

Overall, DNA target sequencing provides a somewhat higher rate of species identifications than phenotypic methods with an accuracy between 62% up to 92% depending on the group of bacteria studied and the criteria used to define a species (Bosshard et al., 2003a, Bosshard et al., 2004, Bosshard et al., 2006, Heikens et al., 2005, Simmon et al., 2006, Simmon et al., 2008b). The 16S rRNA gene target will not however discriminate many species within the Enterobacteriaceae or closely related Staphylococcus, Enterococcus or Streptococcus species (Petti, 2007, Petti et al., 2008a, Petti et al., 2008c). Similarly, fungal sequencing using the ITS or D1/D2 gene regions provides excellent identification compared to phenotypic methods and allows much more rapid identification of non-sporulation molds and rare yeasts that are difficult to identify using classical methods (Ciardo et al., 2007, Ciardo et al., 2010, Borman et al., 2008, Borman et al., 2010, Pounder et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Molecular typing of bacterial isolates is required for infectious diseases epidemiological surveillance, to detect laboratory cross contamination, distinguish relapse from re-infection, and for surveillance during infectious outbreaks (van Belkum et al., 2007). Molecular typing is therefore crucial for source tracking and epidemiology (van Belkum et al., 2007, Fournier and D. Raoult, 2011). Van Belkum and colleagues published a comprehensive review and guidelines for the validation and application of molecular typing methods for use in bacterial epidemiology (van Belkum et al., 2007). Among non-sequence-based methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), which separates macro-restriction DNA fragments has been the \u201cgold standard\u201d technique used by clinical laboratories to examine the molecular relatedness of bacterial isolates as well as yeasts and fungi (Beadle et al., 2003). Provided that the PFGE method and interpretation are carefully standardized for a given microorganism, this method has robust reliability and intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility (Goering, 2010). Similar DNA fragment-based methods have also been developed and used for clinical analyses including; restriction endonuclease fingerprinting analysis (REA) (Falk et al., 1985), plasmid typing (Farrar, 1983, Mayer, 1988, Nicolle et al., 1992), ribotyping (Thomson-Carter et al., 1989), PCR fingerprinting (Welsh and McClelland, 1990), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (Goh et al., 1992, Metzgar et al., 1998), and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (Vos et al., 1995, Meudt and Clarke, 2007). Multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) is another PCR-based method, which is used to determine the number and length of variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) present in a genome due to slipped mispairing (van Belkum et al., 1998, Fournier et al., 2007). Several MLVA systems have been developed for interpretation of a variety of species (van Belkum et al., 2007) but few multicentre studies have been done (Francois et al., 2005, Kremer et al., 2005).",

The Diversilab system performs semi-automated repetitive-PCR analysis (Healy et al., 2005) and has good to excellent agreement compared to several other typing methods for distinguishing several different types of micro-organisms (Fluit et al., 2010, Overdevest et al., 2011, Deplano et al., 2011) including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (Tenover et al., 2009, Babouee and Frei, 2011, Choo et al., 1989), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (Chuang et al., 2010, Bourdon et al., 2011), and commonly encountered dermatophytes dematophytes, Candida and fungi (Pounder et al., 2005, Pounder et al., 2006, Wise et al., 2007, Hansen et al., 2008). This method has also been used to genotype Acinetobacter baumanii outbreaks strains, and extended-spectrum B-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (Pitout et al., 2009, Brolund et al., 2010, Higgins et al., 2012). Semi-automated rep-PCR (Diversilab) however does not always provide the same discrimination power as PFGE or other typing methods (Babouee and Frei, 2011, Bourdon et al., 2011, Brolund et al., 2010, Chuang et al., 2010, Church et al., 2011a, Church et al., 2011b, Tenover et al., 2009). Recognizing this limitation of this semi-automated platform, Diversilab may nevertheless be a useful tool for the rapid identification of nosocomial outbreaks (depending on the type of bacteria involved) when used in parallel with confirmatory analysis with greater discriminatory power.",

Single-locus sequence typing (SLST) uses the DNA sequence obtained from a highly variable single genetic locus to provide strain discrimination. Genotyping of Streptococcus pyogenes using the emm locus relies on sequencing of 150 bps coding for the N-terminal of the M protein (Simmon et al., 2008a). Interestingly, SLST typing of S. pyogenes has identified more than twice as many M-types as previously shown by using antisera (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/strepindex.htm). Many clinical laboratories also now rely on SLST typing of S. aureus according to the spa gene that encodes protein A. Rapid sequence determination of the spa-type may now be automated because of the development of dedicated software for sequence interpretation (Harmsen et al., 2003a, Harmsen et al., 2003b). The clinical appeal of SLST systems such as the one developed for S. aureus are the ability to use existing equipment (many laboratories have automated sequencers) and the excellent site to site reproducibility.",

However, these more expensive, laborious and complex methods have mainly been used for specific population-based microorganism diversity or population-based epidemiological studies, and currently are not widely performed as a diagnostic technique. The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), which is based on identifying point mutations at various genomic loci, has been used for genotypic characterization of several bacterial pathogens (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP). MLST is based on determining the DNA sequence variation of several housekeeping genes (5\u201310) and has proven its taxonomic utility largely due to standardized interpretation, publically available software (i.e., eBURST) and the accessibility of databases (http://www.mlst.net). Multi spacer typing (MST) relies on a combination of the most variable intergenic spacers between strains (Fournier et al., 2007). Reports using this method are restricted to Rickettsia isolates (Fournier and Raoult, 2007).",

Broad-range PCR offers an important clinical benefit for analysis of critical culture-negative samples as it can detect bacterial nucleic acid present in a sample through targeting conserved bacterial sequences (described in Section 2.2). Nucleic acid sequencing of amplicon generated by broad-range PCR allows identification of the organism(s) by comparison with known sequences deposited at Genbank or other databases (Drancourt et al., 2000, Janda and Abbott, 2002, Petti, 2007).

            "text": "Several investigators initially used amplification of conserved regions of bacterial ribosomal RNA and amplicon sequencing to identify human pathogens (Bottger, 1989, Wilson et al., 1990). Subsequently broad-range PCR has been extensively used non-selectively to detect bacterial DNA in clinical samples (Monstein et al., 1996, Corless et al., 2000, Nadkarni et al., 2002, Nikkari et al., 2002, Harris and Hartley, 2003, Saravolatz et al., 2003, Xu et al., 2003, Ott et al., 2004, Jordan et al., 2005, Zucol et al., 2006, Fenollar and Raoult, 2007, Rosey et al., 2007, Reier-Nilsen et al., 2009, Chang et al., 2011). Rather than perform multiple monoplex PCR assays on a given sample, broad-range assays are designed such that a single clinical sample can be simultaneously screened for multiple organisms (i.e., any bacterial species); however, amplicons may require cloning prior to sequencing in order to get an accurate result with traditional Sanger-based methods due to the potential mixed nature of amplified products (Grahn et al., 2003). This approach has been successfully applied to clinical samples from normally sterile sites to diagnose invasive bacterial or fungal infections, including culture-negative meningitis, pneumonia and endocarditis. Increasingly, this approach is also being used to identify the putative pathogen(s) in a number of inflammatory diseases, and for detection of known pathogens that are not easily diagnosed using standard methods. Tropheryma whippelii was identified as the cause of Whipple\u2019s disease using a broad-range molecular PCR (Lepidi et al., 2004). Helicobacter pylori, the cause of peptic ulcer disease, has been found to be the dominant microbiota in the human stomach using broad-range molecular analysis (Bik et al., 2006). Broad-range 16S PCR has also been used to detect clinically relevant Chlamydia spp. infecting humans and animals (Goldschmidt et al., 2006).",

Several studies have shown substantial increases in the sensitivity of broad-range PCR reactions when clinical samples undergo prior culture enrichment in broth or shell vials rather than direct plating prior to molecular analysis (Harris and Hartley, 2003, Gouriet et al., 2005, Saglani et al., 2005). Enrichment culture of 382 pediatric fluid and tissue samples in a broth medium prior to 16S rDNA PCR identified several pathogens in these samples that were not previously detected by primary plating or direct PCR of extracted DNA from the sample (Harris and Hartley, 2003). Saglani and colleagues also performed 16S broad-range PCR on pleural fluid samples from 32 children with empyema and detected bacterial DNA in 75% of the samples following enrichment culture versus only 18.7% after direct plating (Saglani et al., 2005). Culture-enrichment in parallel with broad-range PCR has also been shown to be an effective means of bacterial recovery and identification from cystic fibrosis sputum (Sibley et al., 2011). Shell vial culture has also been used as an enrichment technique for the growth of fastidious or previously uncharacterized micro-organisms from clinical samples (Gouriet et al., 2005). Human embryonic lung fibroblast and human endothelial cell lines have been used most often followed by 16S broad-range PCR and sequencing to identify the organism.",

However, DNA contamination from other sources including environmental or commensal organisms, PCR reagents including Taq polymerase, or even the disposables have been identified as a major concern for broad-range PCR due to the sensitivity of the assay (Corless et al., 2000, Vandecasteele, 2002, Mohammadi et al., 2005, Chang et al., 2011). Universal primers and probes that target the 16S rRNA gene have therefore been recently adapted to a real-time broad-range PCR in order to minimize this problem (Kobayashi et al., 2005, Goldschmidt et al., 2006, Zucol et al., 2006, Deutch, 2007, Schabereiter-Gurtner et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The universal 16S rRNA gene target and the high sensitivity of PCR can be a limitation due to false positive test results when analyzing clinical samples. Even small amounts of bacterial DNA contamination either within the clinical sample, or introduced during some part of the molecular procedure may result in a false positive broad-range PCR result, or a result that is difficult to interpret because of the amplification of one or more common commensal organism(s). Investigators have outlined several sources of bacterial DNA contamination that may occur during the sample collection, nucleic acid extraction or PCR analysis steps (Millar et al., 2002, Millar et al., 2007, Vandecasteele, 2002, Fenollar et al., 2006, Fenollar et al., 2008b). Despite clinical laboratories having standard operating procedures for the collection of all types of clinical samples, contamination by commensal organisms remains problematic with many specimen types (Blake and Doherty, 2006, Dhillon et al., 2009, Marlowe et al., 2010, Patton and Schmitt, 2010, Ishikawa et al., 2011). DNase or restriction enzymes may also be used to de-contaminate the PCR reaction mixture (Millar et al., 2002, Vandecasteele, 2002). Broad-range PCR assays should only be performed using good molecular laboratory practices as previously outlined (Mitchell et al., 2011). In addition, it is critical that a human DNA amplification control as well as a positive and negative control (Tanner et al., 1998, Millar et al., 2002, Bosshard et al., 2003b, Greub et al., 2005, Fenollar et al., 2008b) be included during sample extraction and carried throughout the procedure. Negative controls should consist of a negative sample control (i.e., an aliquot of a known negative clinical sample such as blood from a person without bacteraemia), and a negative reaction mixture control (i.e., contains all reagents but no clinical sample extract) in order to detect reagent contamination. Commercial reagents may also be the source of bacterial contamination and may need to be sterilized using filtration of other methods prior to use (Muhl et al., 2010, Chang et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Currently there is no universal DNA extraction protocol that is effective for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and the extraction method impacts the analytical sensitivity of the assay. Prior studies of broad-spectrum PCR have used enzyme treatment (lysozyme, proteinase K), freezing and thawing or boiling, mechanical disruption, a commercial method (i.e., QiAmp Blood Kit, Qiagen or automated instrument) or a combination of these methods for DNA extraction (Schuurman et al., 2004, Zucol et al., 2006, Rosey et al., 2007, Fenollar et al., 2008b). Zucol and colleagues determined the analytical sensitivities of broad-range RT-PCR based assays employing one to three different genomic DNA extraction protocols in combination with one or three different primer pairs targeting the 16S rRNA gene to detect a panel of 22 bacterial species (Zucol et al., 2006). A DNA extraction protocol using lysozyme, lysostaphin and proteinase K followed by PCR amplification using primers Bak11W/Bak2 (796 bp product), resulted in the best overall sensitivity; 82% of the strains were detected at a low concentration (Zucol et al., 2006). The selection of primers and probes for broad-range PCR assays also effects analytical sensitivity. Primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene are used in most of these assays, while some have also targeted the 23S rRNA gene (Greisen et al., 1994). As outlined by Baker et al. (2003), it is not possible to develop a 16S rRNA gene primer set that will be entirely universal. Therefore, different conserved regions within the 16S rRNA gene and various primer sequences for been employed for analysis of human clinical specimens (Greisen et al., 1994, Baker et al., 2003). The target loci and the primer sequences impact taxonomic assignments. In addition, analysis of existing primer sets demonstrates that environmental organisms within the Archaea and Eukarya can also be detected. Another limitation of this approach is that a definitive identification is not always possible due to the lack and quality of data in public databases as well as insufficient sequence divergence within the 16S rRNA gene sequence between certain taxonomic groupings (Petti, 2007, Petti et al., 2008a, Simmon et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Despite these limitations, the diagnostic utility of broad range 16S rDNA PCR has been evaluated in a variety of clinical conditions including endocarditis, meningitis, bone and joint infections and endophthalmitis (Fenollar and Raoult, 2004, Sontakke et al., 2009). This method has also been used to determine the cause of infection in pediatric patients with fever and neutropenia (Jordan et al., 2005, Ammann et al., 2007, Reier-Nilsen et al., 2009) or culture-negative intracerebral abscesses (Petti et al., 2008b) as well as to determine a cause of death in patients with unexplained mortality and critical illness (Nikkari et al., 2002). The implementation of 16S broad-range PCR to detect and differentiate bacteria in heart valve specimens substantially improves the diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis (Millar et al., 2001, Marin et al., 2007). Although heart valve culture remains part of the Duke classification scheme for the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis, its poor sensitivity (7.8\u201325.4%) and specificity (71.6\u201388.6%) has led several investigators to recommend that culture testing be replaced by broad-range PCR as a major diagnostic criterion because of its much higher sensitivity (range = 41.2\u201396%) and specificity (95\u2013100%). Several studies have documented the reliability of broad-range PCR for the detection of bacteria in excised heart valves and this assay is being increasingly used in conjunction with blood cultures to determine the microbial aetiology in both blood culture-positive and -negative endocarditis cases (Millar et al., 2001, Moore et al., 2001, Bosshard et al., 2003b, Lepidi et al., 2003, Lepidi et al., 2004, Breitkopf et al., 2005, Greub et al., 2005, Houpikian and Raoult, 2005, Raoult et al., 2005, Rice and Madico, 2005, Rovery et al., 2005, Marin et al., 2007, Dreier et al., 2008, Munoz et al., 2008, Voldstedlund et al., 2008, Tang, 2009, Fournier et al., 2010, Caram et al., 2008). Broad-range 16S rDNA gene PCR on heart valve tissue allows diagnosis of unusual causative agents of culture-negative endocarditis including Cardiobacterium hominis (Mueller et al., 1999), Bartonella quintana (Houpikian and Raoult, 2005, Dreier et al., 2008), Tropheryma whipplei (Lepidi et al., 2004, Thuny et al., 2010), Mycoplasma spp. (Fenollar et al., 2004) and Coxiella burnetii (Issartel et al., 2002, Thuny et al., 2010).",

For example, in the case of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample testing positive by 16S broad-range PCR for a bacterial meningitis pathogen, the patient\u2019s clinical presentation and other CSF test results (i.e., CSF glucose, protein, cell count and culture) should be consistent with a diagnosis of acute meningitis. Further strength is also added to a 16S broad-range result of detection of a rare or unusual pathogen when the same micro-organism is detected in longitudinal samples, multiple samples of the same kind from several patients or several different specimen types. Interpretation of the presence of common specimen/culture contaminants by broad-range 16S PCR may be particularly difficult when the isolate may also be a potential cause of infection (i.e., Streptococcus viridans sp. or coagulase negative staphylococci).",

Broad-range PCR studies for the detection of bacterial DNA in heart valve tissue have clearly demonstrated that bacteria are slowly cleared from tissue despite antibiotic therapy, so that molecular assay results should be interpreted with caution because the bacteria may no longer be viable. Rovery and colleagues showed that bacterial DNA was found on heart valves more often in patients who underwent heart valve replacement while still on antibiotic therapy (60%) versus those having surgery after completion of their antibiotic treatment (37%, p\n = 0.02) (Rovery et al., 2005). The presence of bacterial DNA was however highly correlated with the presence of histological lesions (p\n = 0.0001) and with the presence of bacteria in the tissue Gram stain (p\n < 0.0001).",

It shows great promise for identifying a broad range of pathogens without prior knowledge of the pathogen\u2019s nucleic acid sequence (http://us.plex-id.com/stystemoverview) (Ecker et al., 2008, Baldwin et al., 2009). PCR/ESI-MS can also provide results that include information about an organism\u2019s genotype, resistance, or virulence profile. Although currently restricted to epidemiological genomic studies and pathogen discovery, this technology may have a major diagnostic advantage in being able to provide detection, identification and characterization of a broad range of pathogens directly from clinical specimens.

Briefly, all microarrays consist of millions of pre-designed and developed oligonucleotide probes (i.e., consisting of either dsDNA, PCR amplicons 200\u2013800 bp from a known genetic sequence, shotgun library clones or cDNA) that are specifically bound and immobilized on the solid-surface support of the array. The target nucleic acid extracted from a pathogen or clinical specimen of interest is fluorescently labeled and subsequently hybridized to the probe matrix of the microarray. A successful hybridization event between the labeled target molecule and an immobilized probe oligonucleotide creates increased fluorescence intensity above the background level, which can then be measured using either a fluorescent scanner or a flow cytometer. The large amount of complex data generated from a microarray assay can then be analyzed by using a variety of methods with sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms (Zhang et al., 2009, Kaewpongsri et al., 2010, Loewe and Nelson, 2011).",

The major factors limiting implementation of printed and commercial microarray assay formats in the clinical microbiology setting are outlined in Table 2\n(Miller and Tang, 2009). Although several commercial suppliers have developed infectious diseases microarrays for research purposes or will manufacture customer-specified assays, commercial assays that have been used diagnostically detect a large panel of respiratory viruses (Petti and Hillyard, 2007, Nolte et al., 2007, Pabbaraju et al., 2008, Merante et al., 2007) including the only FDA-approved xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel FAST assay (i.e., eight different respiratory viruses including strains of Influenza A, B), which has a liquid suspension bead-based format (Luminex) (Krunic et al., 2007, Merante et al., 2007, Pabbaraju et al., 2008) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Ont. Although other commercial NanoChip\u00ae Nanogen) microarray panel tests were previously developed for infection testing (human papilloma virus, transplantation, bacterial pneumonia, infection control, tuberculosis and a gastrointestinal panel), the company discontinued its microarray business in 2007.

To date, microarray techniques have been most widely applied for the detection, identification and genotyping of human papilloma viruses (HPV) known to causing cervical dysplasia, and cancer of the cervix and other sites (Hwang et al., 2003, Oh et al., 2004, Albrecht et al., 2006, Gheit et al., 2006, Klug et al., 2008, Ermel et al., 2010, Eklund et al., 2010, Schopp et al., 2010, Cho et al., 2011). Currently there are about 100 identified genotypes of HPV, of which about 40 are genital HPV types that have been assigned to either oncogenic or \u2018high-risk\u2019 or non-oncogenic or \u2018low-risk\u2019 categories based on their detection in cervical cancers (Munoz et al., 2003). Worldwide, HPV types 16 and 18 have been shown to cause the majority of cervical cancers, approximately a half of high grade precancerous lesions and a quarter of low grade lesions, whereas low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 cause most genital warts and some low grade cervical lesions (Munoz et al., 2003, Li et al., 2011). Epidemiologic surveillance of high-risk HPV genotypes is therefore important for not only clinical care but also vaccine development. One of the earliest studies of the clinical efficacy of an HPV oligonucleotide microarray for detections of 15 types of high-risk HPVs (16/18/31/33/35/39/45/51/52/54/58/59/66/68/69), and seven types of low-risk HPVS (6/11/34/40/42/43/44) from various histological cervical lesions showed that this was a highly comparable method to PCR-RFLP analysis; HPV DNAs were detected in 158 and 174 of the 234 cervical samples by PCR-RFLP compared to HPV microarray method, respectively (Hwang et al., 2003). Subsequent studies have compared several commercial HPV detection and genotyping assays, and highlighted the differences in their performance with regards to type-specific detection rates of various HPV genotypes (Klug et al., 2008, Ermel et al., 2010, Eklund et al., 2010, Schopp et al., 2010, Cho et al., 2011). Eklund and colleagues (2010) for the WHO HPV Laboratory Network recently performed a global proficiency study of HPV genotyping used in HPV surveillance and vaccinology by distributing 43 coded samples composed of titration series of purified plasmids of 16 HPV types (6/1/16/18/31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59/66/68) whereby detection of at least 50 IU of HPV 16 or HPV 18 DNA and of 500 genome equivalents of the other 14 less prevalent HPV types was considered proficient. Participating laboratories used more than 21 HPV-genotyping assays including the Linear Array (Roche), Lineblots (in-house, PGMY), InnoLiPa (Innogenetics), DNA chip (Biocore), as well as type-specific real-time PCR(GenoID), PCR-RFLP, PCR-Luminex (Multimetrix), PCR sequencing and microarray assays (Papillocheck, Genetel, in-house). HPV 16 and 18 were detected in 98.7% and 92.2% of the data sets, respectively, while less common HPV types 56, 59 and 68 were detected in less than 80% of the data sets. Aside from non-detection of specific HPV types, false-positive HPV genotyping results occurred for two commercial tests and were also reported in twenty-eight data sets which also were considered nonproficient. Although the sensitivity of HPV tests for detection in cervical screening programs need not be as high for less commonly encountered oncogenic HPV types, clinical laboratories need to know the limitations of various microarray methods and follow recently published guidelines for evaluation of such tests before implementation (Meijer et al., 2009).",

However, sensitivity of microarray assay detection and identification of pathogens from clinical samples is highly dependent on target gene(s), and enhanced by specific microbial gene amplification before analysis by the array. Either a broad-range or a multiplex PCR is commonly used that targets conserved regions within the 16S bacterial and 28S fungal and intergenic transcribed spacers (ITSs) in rRNA genes prior to microarray analysis of downstream PCR products instead of relying on DNA target sequencing (Rood et al., 2008). An early application of this approach was the panel detection of 40 predominant human intestinal bacterial pathogens from clinical stool samples (Blyn et al., 2008, Ecker et al., 2008). Other clinical applications of user-defined microarrays include; rapid detection and characterization of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Koessler et al., 2006), detection of antimicrobial resistance genes (Bager et al., 1999), and microbial typing of bacterial enterocolitis pathogens (Volokhov et al., 2003, Fitzgerald et al., 2007).",

The technique utilizes one or both PCR primers labeled with a fluorescent dye (labeling both forward and reverse primers can improve resolving power) to amplify the universal 16S rRNA gene from a bacterial community of interest. The resulting amplicon is digested with one or multiple restriction enzymes (at four base pair recognition sequences), salts and primers are removed and the relative abundance of terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) are resolved by polyacrylamide gel or capillary electrophoresis. The resulting data represents a semi-quantitative profile of the most dominant community members.",

Importantly, the technique is best suited for microbial communities with low to intermediate richness; in populations with greater than 50 distinct organisms the resolving power can be significantly reduced (Engebretson and Moyer, 2003). Like all PCR-based assays, the technique suffers from amplification bias. Appropriate primer selection is essential; however, it must be noted that a catchall, perfect universal primer set does not exist for community profiling (Marsh et al., 2000). Programs are available to optimize primer design and selection but can be limited by the incompleteness of current databases (Collins and Rocap, 2007).",

T-RFLP is most robust when the in silico predictions are corroborated with parallel 16S rRNA sequencing (either clone-based or 454 pyrosequencing (Jakobsson et al., 2010). This is because microbial identification data based solely on in silico predictions are not often reliable and can be confusing because of the vast number of possible organisms predicted for each T-RF, many of which suffer from the \u201cuncultured bacterium\u201d phenomenon.

This sequencing by synthesis approach exploits the liberation of pyrophosphate to mediate by the ATP-dependent conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin. Perhaps the most important advancement in high-throughput sequencing with respect to microbial community profiling has been the advent of barcoding pyrosequencing, which allows for hundreds of microbial communities to be sequenced to exceptional depth simultaneously (Hamady et al., 2008). Barcodes are effectively added to each sequence either by ligation or by amplification with a barcoded primer. There are several different barcoding strategies but it is generally recommended that error-correcting and error-detecting codes should be used (Hamady and Knight, 2009). Fortunately, it appears that different barcode sequences do not significantly alter the community analysis from replicate samples (Hamady et al., 2008, Turnbaugh et al., 2009).",

It appears that variability between commercially available DNA extraction kits and bead beating in hot phenol may not be tremendously important in terms of species presence/absence but concentration of each community member can vary significantly between extraction protocols (Wu et al., 2010).

However, at a depth of at least 1000 sequences per sample one can confidently infer frequencies of organisms at >1% abundance. If the goal is a complete assessment of all the microbial constituents in a sample, much deeper sequencing may be required and often it is not even possible or practical to accomplish such a task. It has been estimated that if an entire 454 run (1 million reads) was used to for a single fecal sample (5 \u00d7 105 sequences) only five cells in every billion total cells would be sampled (Hamady and Knight, 2009).

It has recently been suggested that a combination of V1\u2013V3 and V7\u20139 might provide better representative characterization (Kumar et al., 2011). Regions V2 and V3 appear to be most effective for universal detection of pathogens (Chakravorty et al., 2007). As with any PCR application, primer selection is critical and primer bias always exists in any community analysis (Walters et al., 2011). However, appreciating what groups of organisms might be disproportionally represented in a given experimental design must be considered. If a metagenomic-based sequencing study was done in parallel to the community profiling, the organisms underrepresented because of PCR bias would not be overlooked (Hamady and Knight, 2009).",

            "text": "An important consideration with all next-generation sequencing technologies is error rate. Error rates are considerably better with the newer GS FLX instrument and can be <1%. The accuracy of next-generation pyrosequencing is comparable to Sanger sequencing (error rates of 0.03\u20130.07%) when assembly of multiple overlapping sequence reads can be used to correct for sequencing error. This is not possible for community analysis whereby every sequence read represents a distinct organism in the community. Strategies to remove sequences with errors in primer sequence or with read length abnormalities from the data set can significantly improve data quality (Huse et al., 2007). However, care must still be taken to avoid overestimating the diversity in the rare biosphere due to sequencing error (Quince et al., 2009, Reeder and Knight, 2009) and certainly distinguishing low frequency organisms from sequencing error will continue to be an area of intense investigation (Gilles et al., 2011). If the clinical lab is only interested in characterizing the dominant community members, the issues associated with over representing rare organisms would not be an issue because singleton or doubleton reads could be ignored (Petrosino et al., 2009). Chimeric 16S sequences can also be generated during PCR amplification. Software for detecting sequence hybrids exist (Huber et al., 2004, Edgar, 2011, Haas et al., 2011) but there has been no entirely effective solutions to deal with this issue in large pyrosequencing data sets.",

However, 16S sequencing is not often used in the clinical laboratory for strain-level comparisons because more accurate techniques exist. In a clinical laboratory setting, species level and in some cases strain level determinations are critical for many pathogens. This level of unequivocal taxonomic assignment can, in certain instances, be difficult with 400 bp of 16S rRNA sequence from pyrosequencing and often the most reliable perspective is at genera-level. Confirming specific pathogens by real-time PCR and characterizing them at the strain level by PFGE or MLST could still be required.",

Hamady and Knight (2009) nicely outline the three major axes for ecological analysis of microbial diversity from community profiling data: alpha vs. beta diversity, qualitative vs. quantitative analyses and phylogenic vs. taxon-based analyses (Hamady and Knight, 2009). The type of analysis employed depends entirely on the study design. In a clinical laboratory it is likely that a quantitative, taxon-based, alpha diversity metric would be most appropriate; meaning that a diagnostic platform would measure the concentration and number of taxa in each sample, with an approach that treats all taxa as phylogenetically equivalent entities.",

The most impressive example of the power of metagenomics to date is the sequencing of nearly 3 million protein coding genes in the fecal metagenome by deep Illumina-based sequencing (Qin et al., 2010). Viral pathogens can also be detected directly using an unbiased metagenomics approach to clinical specimens (Nakamura et al., 2009). During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak there were no laboratory tests initially available to identify the virus and it has been suggested that the virus may have been circulating for months prior to its identification (Smith et al., 2009). Metagenomics was capable of detecting the influenza virus at titers near the limit of detection of RT-PCR (Greninger et al., 2010). This approach could play an important role in rapid detection of other novel pathogens during outbreaks of acute, unexplained illness (Tang and Chiu, 2010). It has already been applied to the diagnosis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in transplant recipients (Palacios et al., 2008), in addition to defining the etiology of hemorrhagic fever outbreaks (Towner et al., 2008, Briese et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Bacterial genome sequencing, originally an extremely labor intensive and time consuming process, could realistically become a routine tool in diagnostics, epidemiology and infection control (Pallen et al., 2010). When no reference genome exists, 454-based pyrosequencing is best suited for de novo assembly due to the long read lengths; however, platforms that output shorter reads are suitable if a scaffold genome is available. The anthrax attacks of 2001 highlight the need for rapid bacterial genome sequencing. 454-based pyrosequencing technology was shown to be capable of generating a draft genome of Bacillus anthracis that could be used to assess relevant genetic variants in less than 24 h (Chen et al., 2010). More recently, the genome of the E. coli isolate implicated in the outbreak in Europe was completely sequenced in the matter of a few hours using the Ion Torrent platform. Sequencing a bacterial genome is no longer expensive and it has been estimated that a Streptococcal genome with greater than 150-fold coverage can cost as little as US$100 (Vernet et al., 2011). Whole genome sequencing has great value as an epidemiologic tool and was recently shown to be superior to the gold standard typing method, PFGE, during a recent Canadian Listeria monocytogenes outbreak (Gilmour et al., 2010). Similar observations have been made with multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (Lewis et al., 2010). Genome wide SNP analysis is an extremely discriminating tool for studying transmission events and could be adopted by the clinical laboratory for routine and outbreak surveillance. Such approaches have generated an insightful perspective on the epidemiology of epidemics including the important community and hospital pathogen, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Harris et al., 2010) and Group A Streptococcus (Beres et al., 2010). In addition to epidemiology applications, whole genome sequencing can also be effective for defining antibiotic resistance determinants of a particular pathogen, such as linezolid resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Feng et al., 2009). Technology now exists for whole genome sequencing from single bacterial cells, which relies on multiple displacement amplification (Rodrigue et al., 2009, Woyke et al., 2010). It will be most interesting to see how such approaches are used to characterize rare, enigmatic members of the human microbiome.",

There is a real need to streamline the bioinformatics such that a technician in the clinical laboratory can manipulate deep sequencing data. The vast amounts of data that a clinical lab would produce are staggering and the computational infrastructure would require significant improvement, which would likely require taking advantage of distributed computing and robust server networks (Petrosino et al., 2009). For community profiling in clinical samples further data is required to indicate the precise clinically relevant biomarkers that predict the pathogenic potential of communities or are effective in disease risk management, before such approaches are commonplace. There are also several technical aspects that need to be resolved before a clear clinical application can be realized. For example, human-associated microbial communities contain both live and dead bacteria and PCR cannot distinguish between these two sources of nucleic acid. The protocol development in this regard has been exciting (Rogers et al., 2008, Nocker and Camper, 2009) but further validation in the high throughput sequencing pipeline is required (Rogers and Bruce, 2010).",

            "text": "Although larger clinical microbiology laboratories are increasingly developing their own molecular assays and procedures in-house, several barriers exist in this process including rigorous validation for the population being tested, quality control, ensuring a high degree of automation, access to dedicated technologists who are trained and experienced in molecular techniques, access to capital to purchase the necessary equipment, and the expense of operating a molecular microbiology laboratory alongside the phenotypic culture-dependent testing. However, implementation of culture-independent testing methods in clinical microbiology will increase over the next decade not only due to the continued development of multiplexing methods (real-time PCR, liquid suspension bead-based arrays) but also due to improvements in future generations of sequencing platforms that increase capacity and read length while reducing cost (Martinez and Nelson, 2010). High-throughput sequencing technologies appear to be following Moore\u2019s law and increasingly the potential applications to clinical microbiology will become more apparent (Pallen et al., 2010). For example, in addition to the bacterial community analysis, deep sequencing has been applied to viral communities in the human body. Deep sequencing of intra-patient HIV viral genomes has revealed an intriguing perspective on viral resistance and ecology (Wang et al., 2007a, Eriksson et al., 2008, Le et al., 2009, Simen et al., 2009). One can envision the next generation of clinical microbiologists having the ability to perform complex analyses as diagnostic and epidemiological tools such as routine genome wide SNPs, high throughput community analysis and streamlined metagenomic testing for novel pathogen discovery within a reasonable clinical turnaround time. However, although the clinical microbiology diagnostic techniques \u2018tool-box\u2019 has the potential to significantly increase in the future, it is very unlikely that culture-independent approaches will entirely replace cultivation of microbes because of the importance of strain stocks and phenotypic information is not easily inferred from genotypic data.",
