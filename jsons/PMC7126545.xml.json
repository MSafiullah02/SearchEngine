Deprotection or nucleophilic aromatic substitution with either NH3 in MeOH or NaOMe in MeOH yielded the corresponding target nucleosides 1,5\n7, 8, 12 and 13. Compounds 9 and 10 were obtained by nucleophilic aromatic substitution with the appropriate amine, immediately followed by deprotection. Initially, synthesis of 14 and 15 was also attempted from 11 and 6, respectively. However, due to prolonged exposure and elevated temperature to force nucleophilic aromatic ring substitution, the desired product could not be isolated. Instead, the product formed was the enol ether resulting from a 5-exo dig cyclization of the 5\u2032-OH onto the alkyne (16 and 17). Therefore, ring substitution was performed before glycosylation (Scheme 2\n), resulting in 20 and 21. Final deprotection of these intermediates furnished 14 and 15.",
