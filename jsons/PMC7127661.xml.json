In calves, economic losses are suffered as a result of mortality, which can reach up to 80%, and also veterinary costs and decreased productivity of survivors. The viral agents most commonly associated with this syndrome are rotavirus and coronavirus, both of which have been shown to be primary pathogens in calves [4], [5]. Although this syndrome is most overtly associated with young animals, subclinical infections are also common in adults which may therefore act as reservoirs for reinfection [6].",

This can be achieved by allowing the neonate to ingest colostrum or milk containing these specific antibodies from its dam (lactogenic immunity). Although most adult cattle are seropositive for both rotavirus and coronavirus antibodies [7], during the transition from colostrum to milk production there is a dramatic decline in antibody titres which partially explains the high incidence of infection in calves older than 5 days. Successful rotavirus vaccines aimed at increasing both the titre and duration of specific antibody in both colostrum and milk have been developed [8], however, similar success has not been reported with vaccines targeted against bovine coronavirus [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].",

After incubation for 2 h at 37\u00b0C on a shaker incubator the wells were washed three times using PBS containing 1% Tween 20. 200 \u03bcl of optimally diluted mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the virus haemagglutinin was then added to each well, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with shaking. After washing, 200 \u03bcl of an optimal concentration of a horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Nordic Immunologicals) was added to each well and incubated with shaking for a further 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing, bound conjugate was visualised using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as the chromagen. After stopping the reaction using 2.5 M sulphuric acid, the optical density (492 nm) was proportional to the amount of bovine coronavirus antigen in the sample. Full quantitation up to a range of 100 antigen units per ml was achieved by including a set of six standards in each assay.",

In study B however, 33% (5/15) of placebo treated animals showed an increase in serum VN antibody levels of log100.5\u20131.0 during the experiment suggesting that \u2018wild type\u2019 BCoV was circulating within the herd. After immunisation, serum VN antibody levels in the vaccinated groups showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in serum VN antibody levels compared with those observed in the placebo control groups. Mean serum VN antibody levels were increased by at least log100.5 by 14 days post-vaccination and these levels were typically maintained until calving. Associated with this increase in serum VN antibody levels, first day colostrum VN antibody was also significantly higher (log100.5\u20130.8) in the test vaccine groups compared with the placebo control groups. Similar differences were maintained in milk antibody throughout the period of study (up to day 4 on the dairy farms and up to day 28 on the beef suckler farms). The smallest increase occurred in study B where sero-conversion amongst the placebo treated animals was observed (Fig. 2b). Serum taken from calves allowed to suckle vaccinated dams showed that levels of circulating VN antibody were up to ten-fold higher than those obtained from calves suckling placebo-vaccinated cows.",

For placebo treated animals, irrespective of the vaccination/calving interval, day 0 colostrum possessed VN titres of approximately log104.0, falling rapidly to levels of approximately log102.0 (background) in day 7 milk. In contrast, for the vaccinated cattle, day 0 colostrum possessed VN titres of approximately log104.5, with a much slower reduction in antibody level, only approaching background levels in 28-day milk. The duration of the milk antibody response seen in the vaccinated animals where the vaccination/calving interval was 19 days was less marked than where this interval was longer.

There appear to be some minor differences in the pattern of the antibody responses determined by either HAI or VN in that the HAI responses peak later than the VN responses. This may reflect differences in antibody affinity or sub-class requirements between the two methods of antibody measurement. In terms of neutralising antibody, the major effect of increasing antigen content appears to be in the duration rather than the magnitude of the response. With a vaccine dose containing 190 antigen units of antigen the response was rapid, reaching a plateau approximately 14 days post-vaccination which was maintained until at least 84 days post-vaccination. With a dose containing 38 antigen units of antigen, the virus neutralisation response was equally rapid and of similar magnitude, although in contrast declining rapidly to 84 days post-vaccination. Selection of the correct antigen load therefore appears critical in ensuring an optimal window in terms of the interval between vaccination and calving. An additional advantage in using a higher antigen dose was also demonstrated in cow / calf study B where elevated antibody responses were still observed even in the face of circulating infection. This suggests that vaccination could still play a significant role in enhancing overall herd immunity even in an active disease situation.",

The initial serology data therefore suggested that with a BCoV antigen load of approximately 190 antigen units, successful vaccination could take place at any time between 2 and 12 weeks pre-calving. This hypothesis was supported by the observations on the magnitude of the antibody titres found in the colostrum and milk of cows vaccinated at different times pre-calving with a vaccine containing 150 antigen units of BCoV. Significant responses in colostrum and milk were observed at both ends of the vaccination window, although not all cows vaccinated approximately 14 days pre-calving appeared to show an optimal response.",

Although this would be expected to adversely affect the statistical testing of the results, significant differences (p>0.05) between test and control groups were found on the majority of days tested. This contrasts strongly with previously reported studies wherein increases in BCoV antibody titre in serum or milk following vaccination were either minimal or non-existent [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The reasons for the improved responses observed with the test vaccine are related both to the concentration of BCoV antigen present and the use of an oil adjuvant, which have generally been reported to be highly effective in the enhancement of rotavirus antibody titres in mammary secretions [8].",

This is a result of the number of variables that interact to effect the apparent level of protection obtained.
