As recent trends continue, including large-scale production practices and distribution over ever-larger distances, both the frequency and the severity of consequences of large-scale outbreaks are increasing. In the USA, the number of large-scale (i.e., multi-state) outbreaks increased by 135% in the years 1995\u20132004 to the years 2005\u20132014. These large-scale outbreaks accounted for 3% of total outbreaks, which includes localized, non-distributed incidents, but were responsible for 34% of hospitalizations and 56% of deaths [9].",

This source sends out contaminated products that travel through the network according to the transmission model, resulting in observations of illness at a set of network nodes.

A large-scale outbreak occurs when contaminated food departs from some source in an early stage of the network that is able to reach downstream nodes in geographically distributed locations. The contamination will eventually make its way to consumers, who develop illness some time after consuming the contaminated food.

With this structure mapped, it is straightforward to utilize all case data (i.e., evidence) available during an event to identify the set of feasible sources of contamination, that is, the set of nodes that connect to all known contaminated nodes. Network structural information thus provides a first cut into the source identification problem by enabling the identification of feasible sources. To differentiate between the feasible sources, further dimensions of information available within the network can be leveraged. Each edge contains information about the volume of goods traded between supply network actors. Volume-weighted information is a source of heterogeneity that can be thought of as the relative propagation potential of a given edge, providing insight into the paths along which contaminated product is likely to have traveled.\n",

These methods often assume some variant of the epidemiological model of contagion transmission, including the widely used susceptible-infected (SI) or susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models. However the transmission of contamination through the food supply to people is different from the disease contagion process from people to people. Contamination spreads as contaminated (solid, perishable) food moves through the supply network after being inoculated by the pathogen at the source. As the food is transported through the supply network, the pathogenic quantity will generally remain conserved, meaning it will neither spread to other food items nor decay significantly in infectivity [18, 29]. The former is due to a number of factors including the lack of contact between packaged items, the lack of interaction or mixing between unpackaged items, and the biological insusceptibility of contamination to transmission and decay, i.e. low infectivity and recovery rates.",

Contaminated food items cause infection in people when the food is consumed, but this process does not represent a classical infection dynamics because the contamination is directional (food to human) and largely does not spread between people. Contagion processes represent a different dynamics; if these are applied to the foodborne disease situation, the extremely low infection rate would mean that when individual food items come into contact, the infection will not be transmitted and will die out. The diffusion along the network is the mechanism that moves the contamination forward through the supply chain. To reflect these diffusion dynamics, the foodborne disease contamination spreading process has therefore been modeled as a simple Markov transmission process [14].",

However because contagious transmission is largely not occurring between food items, a metapopulation model would add more complexity (by incorporating the inactivated local contagion process along with the diffusion process) without incorporating more of the dynamics of the spread of contamination by food through the supply chain.

Data regarding the contamination status of individual food items is not normally available during an investigation. Furthermore, it is not possible to establish from the illness reports whether a supply node has ever received contaminated food and is thus susceptible (S), as it may have led to illnesses that went unreported.

The contamination status of transient nodes involved in the production, processing, or storage of food, though closer to the source in number of network edges, will remain hidden to investigators unless further investigations are performed (normally during later stages of an investigation). Furthermore, even at the consumption level, the overwhelming majority of foodborne illness cases are either not identified or logged by authorities, with official estimates of underreporting varying from 10 to 75 times for different pathogens [32].

The seminal work by Shah and Zaman [34] introduces the measure of rumor centrality, which considers the number of linear extensions between each source and the infected nodes. The method and analytical results concerning detection probability are derived for trees or tree-like graphs; to apply to general networks, a Breadth-First-Search (BFS) heuristic that assumes the contamination traveled across the shortest paths to the observations must be used. Other methods based on betweenness centrality [8] and eigenvector centrality [11, 30] apply to general networks without employing a shortest path heuristic, although the calculation of betweenness is based on shortest path properties. These methods were important for establishing foundational results on the network source detection problem but are impractical for real network-outbreak scenarios due to the complete observation assumption.",

The temporal category includes methods assuming discrete-time epidemic (SI/R) contagion models based on dynamic message-passing [20], Bayesian belief propagation, [2], analytic combinatoric approaches [3]. The analytic-combinatoric method [3] builds on the approach of [20] and [2] by removing the node-independence assumption of [20] and the tree-like contact network assumption that both [20] and [2] are predicated on to compute the exact source probability distribution for general contact network structures. Because the analytical calculations increase exponentially for non-tree-like networks, a computationally feasible Monte Carlo estimation approach is provided and demonstrated empirically to provide comparable results with the analytic method. The approach of [3] applies both to static and temporally evolving networks.",

Other temporal methods have been proposed that observe the contamination status of a subset of sensor nodes at user-controlled intervals invoking a Four-Metric approach [33], Monte Carlo methods [1], or analytical methods for time-varying networks [15]. A separate approach is based on time-reversal backward spreading, where link weights are set equal to travel time and not spreading propensity [35].

These networks are characterized by great heterogeneity in path lengths and probabilities, meaning that spreading processes on these networks will be dominated by a small percentage of the shortest, highest probability transport connections. As expected, the Effective Distance method performs well in settings involving outbreaks of infectious disease (e.g., SARS, H1N1) spreading through global air travel networks [6]. Nonetheless, it is a heuristic approach that considers only a single path to each observation. While this type of approximation may be justified in certain network contexts such as the global air mobility networks the method was designed for, it is not adapted for the structure of food supply networks which are characterized by homogeneity in path lengths and the existence of multiple paths of similar probability (see Sect. 3). When the method is applied to the 2011 EHEC (foodborne disease) outbreak, source identification results are less accurate and more unstable than the infectious disease case examples [6, 22].",

This work leverages random walk theory to analytically demonstrate that the single path approach is an approximation of more general logarithmic network-based measures. While both methods are developed in the framework of metapopulation reaction\u2013diffusion models, only the multiple paths approach depends explicitly on the dynamical quantities of the SIR model. This generalized effective distance approach for estimating (forward) disease propagation arrival times is therefore a departure point for an improved and analytical approach to the (inverse) source detection problem for metapopulation propagation processes like infectious diseases spreading through global air traffic networks.",

By modeling the transmission process as a random walk, this work develops a novel, computationally tractable solution to the inverse problem that accounts for all possible paths of travel through the network. Improvements in accuracy and stability are demonstrated in comparison with the single paths approach of [6, 22], when both methods are applied to different network topologies including stylized models of food supply network structure as well as the 2011 EHEC outbreak in Germany.",
