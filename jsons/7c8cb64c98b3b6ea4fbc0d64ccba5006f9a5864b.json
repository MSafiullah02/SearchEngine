Methods This retrospective study was conducted in the Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and Pediatric Neurology unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India involving children with PCR confirmed Influenza A (H1N1) with neurological manifestations during 2019 outbreak. Results Six children (5 females, 1 male) were enrolled. All presented with neurological symptoms (seizures and altered sensorium) accompanied with fever and respiratory symptoms with duration of illness of 2-7 d. The admission Glasgow Coma Scale ranged from 4 to 12. Only 2 cases showed cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Neuroimaging was suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema, acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. All were treated with Oseltamivir. Four cases had clinical features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and were managed in PICU, 3 of them needed mechanical ventilation, 3 needed vasoactive drugs, 3 received 3% saline infusion, 1 underwent invasive ICP monitoring, and 3 (cases 4, 5 and 6) received intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) for 5 d. Total duration of hospital stay was 10-30 d. Case 2 expired due to refractory raised ICP. Among survivors, 3 children had residual neurological deficits and the remaining 2 had achieved premorbid condition. Conclusions Influenza A (H1N1) can present with isolated or predominant neurological manifestations which can contribute to poor outcome. The authors suggest to rule out H1N1 in any child who presents with unexplained neurological manifestations during seasonal outbreaks of H1N1.",

Five out of 6 cases were females with an age range of 6 mo to 10 y (median age 25 mo). All the cases were previously healthy. They had an illness duration of 2-7 d. All cases had fever and respiratory symptoms (cough, coryza, respiratory distress), and one had rash over extremities and face. All the cases had seizures and altered sensorium at admission with GCS ranging from 4 to 12. They had generalized tonicclonic seizures. Clinical signs of raised ICP (tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension, unequal pupils, hypertonia, brisk deep tendon reflexes, pupillary inequality, or abnormal respiration) were noted in 4 cases. One case had focal deficit in form of left hemiparesis (Table 1) . Chest radiographs were abnormal in 3 cases (bilateral infiltrates in cases 1 and 6; right middle zone consolidation in case 4).

The salient features of various studies involving children with neurological manifestations of H1N1 are shown in Table 3 . Amin et al. [5] reported 14 children with acute childhood encephalitis and encephalopathy associated with seasonal influenza and noted that 64% had neurological manifestations within 5 d of onset of respiratory symptoms and >50% had neurological sequelae. Kedia et al. [9] , in a retrospective study demonstrated that neurological complications were noted in 7.5% (23/307) cases during 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 65% (15/23) needed intensive care, 50% (3/6) had elevated CSF proteins but no significant pleocytosis, 83.3% (5/6) had abnormal MRI brain, 13% died, and 22% had short-term disability. Goenka et al. [8] reported 25 cases (21 children and 4 adults) of H1N1 with neurological manifestations, 80% (n = 20) needed intensive care, 16% (n = 4) died, and 68% (n = 17) had poor outcome. Similarly, Khandaker et al. [16] and Wilking et al. [17] also demonstrated that 8.8% -9.7% children with H1N1 developed neurological manifestations, 1/3rd to 2/3rd cases required ICU admission, and 25% -50% needed mechanical ventilation. Other studies also reported poor neurological outcome and sequelae [4, 7, 8] .",
