Children enrolled in this study were of ages ranging from 1 month to 16 years and 11 months (median, 9 months). The overall male-to-female ratio was 1238: 638, with a 1.9 bias towards males. Among all samples, 1476 (78.7%) were positive for at least one viral agent. RSV was the most common viral agent (detected in 572 children [30.5%]), followed by HRV (473 children [25.2%]), PIV (384 children [20.5%]), HBoV (258 children [13.8%]), IV (190 children [10.1%]), ADV (110 children [5.9%]), HMPV (44 children [2.3%]), HCoV (27 children [1.4%]) and HEV (26 children [1.4%]). Among the 26 HEV positive samples, 19 were positive for EV-D68 (1.0%, 19/1876, Fig. 1). The frequency of EV-D68 detection was 0.4% (6/1681) from January 2012 through August 2014 and 9.8% (13/132) from September through October 2014.

Thirteen strains of 2014 Chongqing detected, seven strains from the 2014 US outbreak, and most strains from the 2014 Netherlands detected were grouped into clade B. However, only two Chongqing strains from 2012 and 2013 could be grouped into clade B. The remaining four Chongqing strains were grouped into clade A (two in 2012, and two in 2013). Unfortunately, only thirteen Chongqing strains were nearly full-length nucleotide sequences, including ten strains from 2014, two strains from 2013, and one strain from 2012. Sequence analysis of nearly full-length nucleotide sequences found that the 13 clinical isolates detected in the current study had nucleotide sequence similarities of 89.9\u201399.8% with each other and similarities of 87.8\u201388.2% with the Fermon strain. Strains of clade B demonstrated similarities ranging between 94.3\u201399.8% (nucleotides). A phylogenetic tree constructed with nearly full-length nucleotide sequences revealed that the division of EV-D68 was consistent with Fig. 2 (Fig. 3).",

The children with EV-D68 ranged in age from 1 month to 12 years and 8 months (median, 32 months). The male-to-female ratio was 10:9. The most common signs and symptoms exhibited by the children were cough (100%) and wheezing (90%), with only five (26%) children having fever. Thirteen (68%) children had a history of recurrent wheezing (Table 2). Thirteen children had a discharge diagnosis of asthma, in which twelve children dually diagnosed with pneumonia. Among these thirteen children, eleven were diagnosed with acute asthma exacerbation. Moreover, three children were diagnosed with pneumonia, one child was diagnosed with bronchiolitis, one child was diagnosed with Mycoplasma pneumonia, and one child was diagnosed with bronchitis (Table 1). EV-D68 was detected as a sole pathogen in 8/19 cases (with the exception of other common respiratory viruses, bacteria, and Mycoplasma).

Additionally, increasing evidence supports the relationship between EV-D68 infection and AFP37910. Hasegawa et al. found a strong association between EV-D68 infection and exacerbation of asthma19. In the 2014 EV-D68 outbreak in the US, the percentage of children who had a history of asthma or wheezing in Kansas City and Chicago was 68% and 73%, respectively, and most of these children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit8. At the St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, EV-D68 was detected in seven of ten samples from patients with severe disease20. In our study, most children infected with EV-D68 had a history of recurrent wheezing or asthma and a diagnosis of acute asthma exacerbation. In EV-D68 single detection, the phenomenon was more obvious. Moreover, EV-D68 became the predominant pathogen associated with asthma exacerbation in September and October of 2014. Our study found that a history of recurrent wheezing or asthma may be a risk factor for the detection of EV-D68 and viral-induced acute asthma exacerbation may be a clinical feature of EV-D68 infection in Chongqing area.",

The 5\u2032UTR spacer region of EV-D68 ranged from the end of the IRES and the polyprotein open reading frame (ORF)4. The role of the spacer region in viral fitness remains unclear4. Deletions in the spacer region might be correlated with the worldwide increase in EV-D68412. Our study showed different deletions among clades A, B and C. Clade A only had one deletion (nt 682\u2013704)4, clade C had two deletions (nt 681\u2013704 and 717\u2013727)12, and clade B had two deletions (nt 681\u2013703 and 717\u2013728)5. The 5\u2032UTR was considered a conserved region but the spacer region likely had more mutations. Therefore, more sequences would need to be collected to explore the nucleic acid differences of 5\u2032UTR sequences among different clades. More studies are needed to expound the relationship between the deletions within the 5\u2032UTR of EV-D68 and efficiency of translation, or virulence.",

Previous studies found some distinctively different amino acid substitutions among the three clades, particularly in the BC and DE loops of the VP1 protein456131415. Such changes might modify the immune response and help to explain the biological basis for the increase in EV-D68 incidence413. However, an association between the substitutions and the severity of infection has not been established25. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 sequences suggested that the major EV-D68 epidemic clade varied across time. The epidemic clades of EV-D68 in the Philippines (2008), New York (2009), Japan (2010), and the Netherlands (2010) were clade B, clade A, clade C and clade A, respectively12161726. The predominant clade might shift from clades A and C to clade B, and clade B might expand worldwide. Although the main 2014 EV-D68 epidemic clade in Chongqing, the US, and the Netherlands was clade B, it was different from the epidemic cluster observed in the Philippines in 2008, and no prior increase was reported. Moreover, the EV-D68 strains in certain areas had regional features as evidenced by the fact that the EV-D68 epidemic strains in Chongqing and US belonged to a different cluster than the Netherlands strains. This phenomenon may be linked to the rapid evolution of enteroviruses27.",

Our study provides additional epidemiological and clinical data on EV-D68 infection in China and a resource of genome sequences for genomic comparison of EV-D68.

To study the distribution and diversity of EV-D68 identified in this study compared to other EV-D68 strains, multiple sequence alignments were made using the ClustalW function of the BioEdit program (v7.0.9). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA neighbor-joining algorithm (5.05). The statistical significances of the tree topologies were tested via bootstrapping (1000 replicates). Only bootstrap values >70% are shown in each tree. A phylogenetic tree that was constructed with 369 bp of VP1 gene nucleotide sequences showed that modern EV-D68 strains were divided into three primary clades (A, B and C) according to the classification previously described by Tokarz (Fig. 2)4. Nearly full-length nucleotide sequences that correspond to nt 145\u20137203 of the EV-D68 prototype strain (GenBank accession no. AY426531) were obtained from 13 strains of EV-D68 in the current study. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on this region of nucleotide sequences with the 13 strains from Chongqing (Ten strains from 2014, two strains from 2013, and one strain from 2012), seven strains from the 2014 US outbreak and available EV-D68 sequences that were long enough (Fig. 3).",
