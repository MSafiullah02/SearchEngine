These receptors are major determinants of cell tropism (the cellular types and organisms that can be infected by a given virus) [4]. In addition to primary binding receptors, some viruses also interact with secondary receptors (named coreceptors) that collaborate in the penetration of the virus inside the cell. A comparison of known viral receptors and coreceptors reveals that, occasionally, members of the same virus family have evolved to use a variety of different cell surface proteins for viral entry. It is also possible that very distinct viruses use the same receptor.2.\nEntry of the virus into the cell. Viruses can enter the cell in two main forms: as naked nucleic acid molecules that carry all the information necessary to originate new viruses or as complete particles. The entry of enveloped viruses requires the fusion of viral and cellular membranes by a process driven by viral glycoproteins located on the virus surface. Non-enveloped virus entry into cells involves the disruption of the cellular membrane, in some cases through the formation of pores.3.\nViral uncoating. This process consists in the disorganization of the protective protein layers to release the viral nucleic acid inside the cellular cytoplasm. Sometimes these events are coupled with penetration through the cellular membrane, whereas other viruses experience the disassembly steps inside the cytoplasm.4.\nReplication and expression of genetic information. Briefly, replication of RNA viruses occurs through two basic mechanisms that distinguishes riboviruses from retroviruses [3]:\u2022RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. This process takes place in riboviruses and it is catalyzed by the enzyme RNA replicase.\u2022RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. This is a process known as reverse transcription that is catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Both enzymes, RNA replicases and reverse transcriptases, have to be encoded by the viral genomes and expressed early during the infection cycle. In some cases, these enzymes are copackaged with the viral nucleic acid during the assembly of the viral particles.The intermediary molecule in the flux of genetic information that leads to the synthesis of specific proteins is the messenger RNA (mRNA), the RNA molecule accepted by the cellular ribosomes. This establishes a basic distinction between RNA viruses with negative or positive polarity. Positive polarity viruses can use their genomic RNAs as mRNAs that can be directly translated. In negative stranded viruses the genomic RNA has to be copied to produce subgenomic mRNA and full-length antigenomic RNA. The former can be translated, and the latter can be replicated again to obtain new negative-sense RNA genomes. Retroviruses represent an exception to this scheme. They possess positive polarity genomes that, instead of being translated directly, have to be copied to DNA before the replication cycle is completed. The newly synthesized DNA is integrated into the cellular DNA and transcribed by a cellular RNA polymerase to produce new RNA molecules. The latter can be used as mRNA or packaged inside the new virions.5.\nVirus assembly. This is the process by which a number of structural and non-structural proteins are assembled together with the genomic RNA to constitute a new virus particle.6.\nVirus release. This a crucial step to propagate the infection cell-to-cell or organism-to-organism. Different viruses employ different strategies to leave the cell. Enveloped viruses (those enclosed by a lipid bilayer) are usually released by budding from the plasma membrane. Non-enveloped viruses generally escape via lysis of the infected cell.\n",

This means that each daughter genome will contain on average one or two mutations when compared to the parental sequence. Mutation rate must be distinguished from the mutation frequency, which is the fraction of mutations in a genome population. This last parameter is influenced by the replicative ability of each mutant genome in competition with the rest of genomes in the population. Positive selection favours the presence of mutations with an adaptive value whereas negative selection purges or maintains in low amount genomes carrying deleterious mutations. The frequency of a given mutation in the population can also be influenced by genetic drift, which results from changes in the population size that may lead to the stochastic fixation of mutations irrespectively of their selective value. The main result of genetic drift is a random sampling of the genomes rendering a new composition of the population.",

Occasionally, the new genes prevent recognition of the influenza virus by the immune system of the host, which can result in increased virulence.

Few years later, Jensen [69] confirmed those observations and further detected the presence of revertant mutants. An estimation of the degree of heterogeneity in RNA virus populations could only be determined once nucleotide analysis techniques were available for RNA. Esteban Domingo and colleagues, working with clones of the bacteriophage Q\u03b2, estimated the diversity of fragments obtained after digestion with RNAase T1 (an enzyme that cut the RNA at specific sequences of nucleotides). They found that about 15% of the clones derived from a multiply passaged Q\u03b2 population showed patterns which deviated from those obtained with the bulk RNA extracted from the total virus population [32]. Correction of this value by the length of the sequence analyzed by this technique leads to an estimate of one or two nucleotide differences in each phage genome. As Esteban Domingo and colleagues posed it: The genome of Q\u03b2 phage cannot be described as a defined unique structure, but rather as a weighted average of a large number of different individual sequences\n[32]. These early observations have been confirmed by sequencing techniques and have been extended to all RNA viruses studied.",

Genomes that are only present in low amounts can be determinant in the evolution followed by the population in response to an environmental change. Recently, a type of memory in viral quasispecies has been described. This memory refers to genomes that were very abundant in the population at previous evolutionary stages, and that are present in very low amounts at present [31], [109]. These relic genomes might be very durable and constitute a reservoir of evolutionary possibilities, previously explored by the virus, which may be used again if an environmental change requires it.",

However, the quasispecies might occasionally experience deep reorganizations that are not reflected in the consensus sequence. Variants at memory levels are an example, since those genomes carry mutations that, in spite of never being detected in the consensus sequence, can have a profound influence in the adaptation of the population. When the environmental conditions are relatively constant the virus population can be maintained in evolutionary stasis, with the result that the consensus sequence keeps almost invariant through time. This situation usually occurs in viruses infecting the same host during very long time periods, as influenza in birds or hantavirus in rodents. Evolutionary stasis does not mean, at short evolutionary time scales, that the mutation rates decrease: It represents instead an equilibrium between mutation and selection that yields a consensus sequence mostly without changes. A virus that is kept invariant for a long time can experience an acceleration in the fixation of mutations when the environment is altered, as it occurs during the infection of a new host. A recently studied example is the coronavirus causing the SARS epidemic [107]. At the beginning of the spread of the virus in the human population, it experienced a high rate of fixation of mutations that probably were essential for the adaptation of the virus to the new host.",

An example of this category of viruses is influenza, which through a continuous change in their antigenic properties (antigenic drift) evades the immune system of the host [37]. Usually, this escape mechanism is limited by the fact that, in most viruses, their antigenic determinants are the same proteins required for the penetration of the virus inside the cell [4]. The opposite strategy is that of viruses that have attenuated its virulence up to a limit compatible with persistence in their hosts, without provoking serious disease symptoms. Many of these viruses can stay unnoticed, being only exposed when they infect a new host lacking effective defense mechanisms to defeat the new infectious agent. Acute infections and asymptomatic infections are two extremes of a broad spectrum of relationships between viruses and their hosts.",

The tree has a main trunk with branching points representing drifting strains that become extinct in an approximately one-year period. This type of topology likely results from the continuous emergence of new virus variants that can evade recognition by the immune system through a change in the properties of their antigenic sites. In the case of influenza the renew of susceptibles comes from births of new hosts and from regained susceptibility of previously infected individuals to new influenza variants. The short infectious periods of influenza, together with its high genetic variation, leads to a rapid strain turnover, probably one of the reasons producing the strong seasonality of influenza epidemics. An unresolved question concerns the transmission mode of influenza through respiratory droplets containing just one or a few viral particles. This strong reduction in population size could lead to the fixation of mutations during optimization of the virus inside each particular host. The expected result should be a very high diversity among lineages (infecting different hosts) that is not observed in natural populations of the virus. Mathematical models of influenza epidemics have approached this question by taking into account the balance between the production of new strains and the competition-induced stochastic extinction of existing variants. The results obtained show that, if cross-immunity is the only form of competition between strains, there is an exponential growth of diversity. However, if a short-lived immunity that inhibits reinfection by any new strain during a short time is considered in the model, the probability of explosive diversity growth is strongly reduced [64], [126].",

Due to the long time between transmission events, epidemic cycles are not observable in the case of these viruses. Instead of that, what is observed is a growing epidemic trend. The fact that the infection by a subtype does not protect against new reinfections with other subtypes of HIV or HCV results in a phylogeny that mainly reflects the demographic and spatial history of transmission. The continuous evolution of these viruses inside their hosts permits to perform intra-host phylogenies. In HIV, the highly immunogenic envelope gene presents and intra-host phylogeny similar to that exhibited by influenza A at the population level [63].

The interactions with the molecules secreted by the immune system, the ability to spread the infection from cell to cell and other factors that can enormously diverge from an animal to another often mask a clear-cut interpretation of the results. Quite obviously, these studies are strictly necessary when a new vaccine or a new antiviral drug is being investigated, but they are usually preceded by much simpler in vitro studies. In vitro experiments involve \u201cadaptation\u201d to susceptible cells that can be cultivated and that may differ from those infected by the original virus population. Viruses often behave differently on different types of cultured cells, and in addition each of the culture types holds technical advantages and disadvantages. Typically, adaptations to the new conditions in the laboratory involve serial transfers of the virus in liquid cell cultures that provide the appropriate environment for competition among a large number of genomes, eventually leading to the selection of the most fit to the new situation.

When this number is strongly reduced, the viral progeny results from a few, even a single, founder particle. In situations where a virus is plated on a cell monolayer using low multiplicity of infection (MOI), only one virion infects a cell, typically. The effect of serial plaque-to-plaque transfers in virus evolution involves isolation of a plaque, extraction of the viral population and, after appropriate dilution, repeated plating on fresh cellular monolayers. Serial plaque-to-plaque transfers enhance the fixation of mutations in the population. In addition, since most mutations in an optimised population are deleterious, fitness loss is the expected result accompanying repeated population bottleneck events. In contrast to plaque-to-plaque transfers, large population passages generally lead to increases in viral fitness [94].",

A simple way to do this consists in plating the population on a Petri dish, isolating a number of lytic plaques (called in this case biological clones), and sequencing the genome of the virus population contained in each plaque independently.

On the one hand, clones of fitness lower than average can be selected at each transfer, such that the average fitness of the population decreases. On the other hand, during the development of a lytic plaque between successive bottlenecks, a certain degree of heterogeneity is generated, both towards lower fitness variants and towards higher fitness variants. As the initial population is placed at a high fitness state, the appearance of less fit mutants is more frequent than the appearance of advantageous ones, as expected. Eventually, however, the generation (and positive selection) of variants of higher fitness balances the appearance (and negative selection) of those with lower fitness. At that point, a statistically stationary state ensues. Seen from another viewpoint, the statistical properties of that state result from the competition of two time scales: that of external perturbations (in the form of population bottlenecks) vs. the time allowed for the generation of diversity between bottlenecks. The former time scale is mostly responsible for negative selection and fixation of lower fitness variants, while the latter enhances the appearance of advantageous mutants and enables active positive selection. Indeed, in some cases where lytic plaques could be barely observed or, apparently, infectious particles were absent, an increase in the development time between bottlenecks permitted the recovery of an infective subpopulation [74].",

The earliest experiments of this kind go back to 1990, and involved the bacteriophage \u03a66 [15]. That phage has a genome divided in three independent segments inside the viral capsid. A significant decrease of infectivity was observed after 40 consecutive transfers which constituted the whole length of the experiment, but neither a statistically stationary state of fitness values, nor extinction of the population, were observed. Other experiments used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a model system [35], [45]. VSV is a negative-sense, ssRNA virus with a single, non-segmented genome, and does not experience recombination at a detectable level. In those experiments, fitness decreased steadily from the average value of the initial, well-adapted population, in agreement with theoretical expectation. As an additional result [43], [95], a dependence of the fitness loss with the initial fitness was observed for the first time: high fitness clones lose fitness faster than clones with lower fitness. Selection pressure is stronger in the latter, such that they are less tolerant to the incorporation of new mutations. Studies with the phage MS2 support the decrease in fitness from an initially well adapted population when bottlenecks are applied [23], with a coefficient c\u22430.16 (Eq. (1)).",

This observation might reflect a different internal time scale in different virus, in the sense that different viruses employ different time lengths in a replication cycle, or in the killing of a cell. It might be that HIV cannot undergo a sufficiently large number of replication cycles to generate the minimum diversity needed to overcome the negative effects of bottlenecks.

In order to optimize fitness, large population passages, which permit competition among mutants and positive selection of best adapted variants, are applied.

However, sex in virus usually refers to forms with segmented genomes that can experience genetic reassortment. This type or genomic reorganization is clearly beneficial for viruses, such as influenza, that can infect different hosts and thus have genes that, in spite of being quite similar, maintain host-specific differences.

In isolation, they were unable to infect, but the simultaneous presence of complete and defective forms in the same population maintained high fractions of genomes with deletions. In fact, at passage 260, the standard, complete form of the virus was 104 times less abundant than the defective genomes. Two defective, complementary forms were isolated: \u0394417 lacked the L-protease coding region and \u0394999 lacked a part of the capsid-coding region, their deletions occurring on non-overlapping parts of the genome. An interesting observation regarding the virulence of the system of defectives as compared to the standard type was that the former produced lytic plaques remarkably smaller than those of the latter.",

This measure was used to compare the two types obtained in the experiments. Interestingly, the functional form of the function T(n0) varied qualitatively with the viral type. While a dependence of the form lnTd(n0)\u221dln(n0) was obtained for the defective type, the killing time follows Ts(n0)\u221dln(n0) for the standard form of the virus [57]. The difference can be explained on the basis of the efficiency of long-range transport in the two-dimensional system where infection propagates. While the standard form can cause infection with a single particle, the requirement of coinfection for the defective forms translates in the inefficiency of long-range transport [85]. In other words, infection of neighboring cells occurs at high MOI, while the dilution caused by long-range transport implies that infection at large distances from the infectious focus occur at low MOI, in which case defection is a losing strategy.",

Among the environmental perturbations whose effects have been studied one can mention treatments with antiviral drugs, presence of mutagens (which increase the mutation rate of the virus), changes in the population size, changes of tropism, or presence of monoclonal antibodies. All of these perturbations usually translate into a strong decrease in the fitness of the virus, but in most cases the previous presence, or the rapid generation of adapted genomes, favours the acquisition of additional mutations that guarantee survival and drastically modify the composition of the quasispecies. Unfortunately, due to the many different processes involved in successful completion of the viral cycle, it is extremely difficult to assess the effect that a single mutation may have on the viral phenotype.",

The mutation induces a change of aminoacid, from asparagine to alanine-25, and this modification causes a destabilization in the \u03b1-helix domain of an envelope protein.

Still, the quantitative determination of the effects of mutations (on FMDV as well as in any other virus) involves cloning of mutants and growth-competition experiments with the standard form. Also of interest are the molecular solutions found by debilitated forms subjected to bottlenecks when massive passages are applied as a means to recover fitness.

In one such study [104], 62 genotypes of VSV carrying pairs of nucleotide substitutions with respect to a standard type were generated and analysed.

That is to say, epistasis (either antagonistic or synergistic) was present. Other studies have also identified epistasis between mutations.

In all cases, viral infectivity was strongly reduced and extinction often followed.

Such infections were monitored under the addition of different amounts of the mutagenic base analog 5-fluorouracil. A number of cellular monolayers were infected and, at different times post infection, the total amount of RNA and the total number of infective particles were quantified [62]. A representative plot of the dynamics of the system is shown in Fig. 4\n. Interestingly, as time elapsed, if any change was to be observed in the intracellular amount of progeny RNA, that was a slight increase. However, the number of plaque forming units decreased, until infectivity disappeared at about 90 hours post infection. The results indicate that the replicative ability of the genome does not disappear concomitantly with infectivity, and suggest the following interpretation of this behaviour. Inside the cell, the products codified by all the infecting viral genomes are available to all of them simultaneously. Since the infection is persistent, cells are not lysed and the main competition among types in the quasispecies is for resources to replicate. The fastest sequences will proportionally increase in number inside the cell. This egoistic behaviour turns out to be lethal for LCMV, since the ability to correctly codify the necessary products for survival is not maintained in the parasitic subpopulation.",

In its original formulation, Eigen's theory predicted the existence of an error threshold (a minimum value of qi) below which a sequence with a selective superiority \u03c3m would disappear from the quasispecies. Suppose that sequence m, the master sequence, is such that it feeds other classes of mutants when incorrectly replicating, but mutants do not revert to the master class.

Evolution of finite populations, and thus the effect of population fluctuations on survival of the master sequence, led to a stronger condition on the replication fidelity, though the qualitative results remained unchanged [24]. This additional restriction on the error threshold is however counterbalanced when selection acting on the phenotype is taken into account. Indeed, the many different genotypes that result in the same phenotype (mutational neutrality) [68] translate into an increase in the error threshold when the degeneracy of the map genotype-phenotype is considered. Though this increase is limited, as shown by theoretical studies [122], analysis of real ribozymes suggest that the classical threshold (7) could be increased up to eight fold [73], thus remarkably alleviating Eigen's paradox. This also implies that two different error thresholds could be defined: a first one where the master sequence is lost, and a second one where the phenotypic information is lost. A review of the notion of error threshold can be found in [11].",

They reached the conclusion that increases in the mutation rate could cause a shift in the dominant quasispecies due to differences in the distribution of neutral nearest neighbours in sequence space. This result has been reformulated [133] and applied to computational models, where it has been observed that, under increased mutagenesis, the winner of a competition between two quasispecies is not necessarily the one occupying the highest fitness peak, but may be the population with the largest neutral neighbourhood (thus the most robust one) [132]. Quasispecies do not only maximize fitness through evolution: in order to minimize the effects of mutations in constant environments, they also evolve towards maximal robustness [128]. Some aspects of this phenomenon were already observed in the experiments with Q\u03b2\n[10], and in subsequent experiments with RNA viruses [13]. Much theoretical interest has been and is currently devoted to the topological properties of the fitness [25] and structure space [52], [53], which determine quasispecies robustness and the evolutionary fate of RNA molecular populations [134].",

            "text": "However, the large amount of asexual, non-recombining species subjected to strong population bottlenecks in their natural environments which, this nonetheless, seemed to keep a high average fitness, turned the attention to other forms in which the continued degeneration predicted by most models could be compensated. The occurrence of compensatory mutations (not reversions) which could have phenotypic effects and even outweigh the effect of the accumulated deleterious mutations has been considered [2], [7], [74], [108], [129]. Indeed, compensatory mutations were proposed as a mechanism as effective as recombination in halting the deleterious effect of the ratchet [129], in the framework of a model that includes as a novelty the separation of effects in the phenotype from changes in the genotype. This distinction is especially relevant in the context of quasispecies, since the mutation-selection equilibrium is defined as the stationary distribution of fitness values selected in the given environment. This equilibrium does not fix the consensus sequence, which would surely be affected by (quasi-)neutral drift. Starting with a high-fitness variant, decreases in fitness due to the action of the ratchet were observed. However, at a certain point compensatory mutations stop the effect of deleterious mutations and the average fitness of the population keeps an average value with small fluctuations around it [129]. Hence, the dynamics display a biphasic behaviour qualitatively analogous to the empirical observations [74], [75]. Actually, all models where compensatory mutations are explicitly included permit to recover higher fitness states in the population, and to escape extinction. As a side effect, biphasic evolution is observed whenever the initial fitness of the population is far from the average stationary fitness at the corresponding statistically stationary state. This is so even when bottlenecks, and thus strong fluctuations in the population size, are systematically applied. As we know now empirically, compensatory mutations are indeed one of the main mechanisms to maintain high fitness.",

A down-mutation (occurring with probability p) moved the offspring of a genome from fitness class w to class w\u22121, while an up-mutation increased fitness from w to w+1 with probability q. By means of numerical simulations, it was shown that vertically transmitted pathogens suffer decreases in fitness much stronger than when transmission is horizontal. A similar model was numerically [74] and analytically [83] studied in order to understand the appearance of biphasic behaviour and, in particular, of the large fluctuations in the viral yield described in Section 2.3. Additional parameters of this model are the size of bottlenecks and the development time between their application [84]. Increases in the number of individuals going through the bottleneck implies that the average fitness at the statistically stationary state increases, as experimentally observed [95]. The development time determines the distance to the mutation-selection equilibrium and constrains the degree of heterogeneity of the population before the bottleneck.",

If bottlenecks are regularly applied such that the development time of the population between bottlenecks is much shorter than the time required to achieve mutation-selection equilibrium, the (out-of-equilibrium) composition of the population P(w) in the presence of deleterious and beneficial mutations can be analytically calculated [83],(12)P(w)\u221d(qp)w\u22121(w+12)g where g is the (integer) number of replication cycles that take place between two consecutive bottlenecks.3\nEventually, this function permits the explicit calculation of the distribution of the viral yield, which in this model follows a stretched exponential function, in qualitative agreement with empirical observations.",

On the other hand, the amount of empirical results steadily increases, and in vitro techniques enable the analysis of single molecules in evolving populations. Analytical approaches become more difficult as more details are implemented in the description of the system, though simple models that can be analytically studied may result in the introduction of new concepts and can be of aid in the isolation of the relevant (universal) mechanisms at play.
