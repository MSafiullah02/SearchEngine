The displacement and redistribution of bats from their natural habitats expose susceptible human and animal populations to micro\u2010organisms (Han et al., 2015). Bats are a unique group of mammals that can fly long distances for daily foraging and aggregate in large colonies. Daily movement patterns, compact roosting structure, hibernation, periodic migration and long lifespan may make bats suitable hosts for emerging viruses (Han et al., 2015).",

They are divided into four major groups: alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses, only the alpha and beta coronaviruses being known to have infected humans (de Groot et al., 2013). The earliest known human coronaviruses (HCoV), HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010OC43 are causes of mild upper respiratory infections. The identification of the precursor of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) in Rhinolophid bats led to more intensive investigations of coronaviruses in humans and in bats (Han et al., 2015). NL63 and HKU1 are newly discovered coronaviruses endemic in humans (Woo et al., 2005; Pyrc, Berkhout, & Hoek, 2007), and MERS\u2010coronavirus is a newly discovered zoonotic coronavirus (de Groot et al., 2013). Recent studies have shown that bat coronaviruses were the source of many human coronaviruses including SARS\u2010CoV, HCoV\u2010229E and NL63 (Han et al., 2015).",

A total of 50 bat guano samples were collected from randomly chosen treetops based on the original numbering. Of the 51 treetops numbered, 10 were chosen in the following order: 1st, 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, 30th, 35th, 40th and 45th and sampled from February to March 2014. The ground areas under the selected trees were covered with clean polythene sheets. The accumulations of droppings were observed and identified immediately prior to collection to confirm the origin of the guano. About 1\u20132 g of each bat guano sample was collected into a vial with viral transport medium (VTM). The guano samples were transported to the Virology Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya for screening with RT\u2010PCR work. The ethical clearance (EC No: 2012/EC/52) for the study was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.",

They may roost in trees closer to human habitation. In 2002, there were 30 bat species documented in Sri Lanka (Yapa, Randeniya, & Ratnasooriya, 2002). Recently, a novel bat lyssavirus designated as Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus was discovered in Pteropus medius bats in the same geographic area of Peradeniya (Gunawardena et al., 2016). Over the last few years, identification of new coronaviruses in bats including the most recently reported lineage D betacoronavirus in cave nectar bats (Eonycteris spelaea) in Singapore (Mendenhall et al., 2017) led us to investigate coronaviruses in fruit bats in Sri Lanka. Detection of lineage D betacoronavirus in guano collected from Pteropus medius bats shows the presence of these viruses in bats, which roost in public places such as the Botanic gardens. Lineage D betacoronaviruses are strictly confined to bats up to now; however, they might evolve to become harmful to humans with public health implications. Pteropus medius are one of the largest species of bats, roost in large trees near waterways or rivers and fly distances of up to 150 Km daily for foraging (Newman, Field, Jong, & Epstein, 2011). They are widespread in South Asia and can be commonly found in peri\u2010domestic settings. In some cultures, these species are also hunted and consumed as food. New bats are born during February\u2013May, and the samples collected in this study were from this period of new bat birthing and may explain the high rates of virus detection observed.",
