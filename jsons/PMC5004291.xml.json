            "text": "The majority of individuals acutely infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) develop chronic infection. Acute infection outcome is determined by the interplay between the virus, the virus\u2010specific immune response, and the host genetics such as polymorphisms in the IL28B/IFN\u2010\u03bb3 locus (encoding for the type III interferon IFN\u2010\u03bb3), the killer cell immunoglobulin\u2010like receptor (KIR) and HLA\u2010C genes controlling the function of natural killer (NK) cells (reviewed in 1, 2). Types I and III IFN responses are induced early during acute HCV. IFN\u2010\u03bb3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs12979860) was associated with spontaneous HCV clearance 3, 4 with the favorable genotype designated as CC and the non\u2010favorable as TT. This SNP is located upstream of the IL28B (IFN\u2010\u03bb3), IL28A (IFN\u2010\u03bb2), and IL29 (IFN\u2010\u03bb1) genes and it was postulated that it may control the transcription or the expression levels of type III IFNs but no clear association was established (reviewed in 5). Type I IFNs were minimally detected in the liver and plasma of chimpanzees during acute HCV infection 6, 7. In contrast, type III IFNs were strongly induced and their expression levels correlated with ISG expression in the liver and viremia in acutely infected chimpanzees 6. In humans, IFN\u2010\u03bb1 was higher than IFN\u2010\u03bb2/3 during acute HCV and correlated with spontaneous resolution of HCV 8. IFN\u2010\u03bb3 rs12979860 SNP is in linkage disequilibrium of the coding sequence of another SNP upstream of IL28B controlling the expression of a relatively new member of the type III IFN family, IFN\u2010\u03bb4, where reduced IFN\u2010\u03bb4 activity was associated with improved HCV clearance and reduced expression of ISGs 9, 10, 11.",

            "text": "NK cells are one of the earliest innate immune effectors against viral infections and are enriched in the liver (reviewed in 12). Two NK cell subsets can be distinguished based on their differential expression of CD56 and CD16: immunoregulatory CD3\u2212CD56brightCD16\u2212 and cytotoxic CD3\u2212CD56dimCD16+. Activity of NK cells is controlled by a combination of activating and inhibitory receptors including KIRs, lectin\u2010like (NKG2A\u2010E), and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46) (reviewed in 13). NK cells are activated and may contribute to protection in HCV\u2010exposed uninfected individuals 14, 15. NK cells were activated in peripheral blood during acute HCV infection irrespective of infection outcome 16, 17, 18 and NK cell activity correlated with the magnitude of adaptive T cell responses suggesting that cross\u2010talk between the two arms of the immune system is an important determinant of the infectious outcome 17. Polymorphism in both IFN\u2010\u03bb3 and KIRs synergize to predict the outcome of acute infection or response to IFN\u2010based therapies 19, 20 and altered NK cell effector functions in chronic hepatitis C were associated with IFN\u2010\u03bb3 polymorphism 21 suggesting an active role for IFN\u2010\u03bb3 in NK cell activation. IFN\u2010\u03bb3 was also recently reported to influence response to an influenza vaccine 22, underscoring the influence of IFN\u2010\u03bb3 on innate and/or adaptive immune responses. Although the level of expression of its specific Interleukin 28 Receptor Alpha (IL28R\u03b1) on lymphocytes and specifically NK cells is controversial 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, its absence compromises NK cell function in vivo 29.",

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in IFN\u2010\u03bb3 may directly and/or indirectly regulate the activation and function of NK cells during acute HCV and their capacity to control HCV infection. We demonstrate that type III IFNs plasma levels were variable during early acute HCV irrespective of the IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype. Nevertheless, CC IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype was predictive of higher viral load during early acute infection and indirectly influenced NKG2A expression and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by NK cells.",

Clinical characteristics and demographics are listed in Table 1. All subjects provided informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Protocol SL05.014) and conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki. Acute HCV infection and estimated time of infection were defined as previously described 17. Spontaneous viral resolution (n = 9) or chronic infection (n = 19) was defined as the absence or presence of HCV RNA, respectively, at 6 months post estimated date of HCV infection. Exposed uninfected (n = 9) are PWID who have admitted sharing a needle or injection materials with an HCV\u2010infected individual but remained HCV RNA and HCV antibody negative. In this study, four time points representing the four phases of HCV infection were analyzed subject to the availability of samples from each patient: i) baseline, defined as time before HCV infection or reported needle sharing for exposed uninfected; ii) early acute, defined as 2 \u00b1 1 month after the estimated time of infection and 1.5 month (range: 1\u20133 months) after needle sharing for exposed uninfected; iii) late acute phase, defined as 6 \u00b1 2 months; and iv) Long\u2010term follow\u2010up, defined as 17 \u00b1 6 months after the estimated time of infection. All patients tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and were either medically ineligible for or declined antiviral therapy. Qualitative HCV RNA tests were performed using an automated COBAS Ampli\u2010Prep/COBAS Amplicor HCV test, version 2.0 (sensitivity <50 IU/ml) (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). Additional HCV RNA quantification was performed using an in\u2010house quantitative real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010PCR assay, as previously described 32.",

Flow cytometry gating strategy is represented in Figure 2A. There were no significant changes in expression of the majority of the receptors (Supplemental Fig. S1). We observed increased expression of NKG2D at the early acute and follow\u2010up time points as compared to baseline. However, due to limited sample availability at baseline when this marker was tested (n = 3), we considered this observation less relevant (Supplemental Fig. S1G). Nevertheless, when all patients were considered, increased NKG2D expression was observed in individuals carrying the CC genotype at the early acute and individuals carrying the *T genotype at both late acute and follow\u2010up time points (Supplemental Fig. S1H). There was no correlation between expression of any of the examined receptors and viral load or plasma levels of IFN\u2010\u03bb3 except for NKG2A. The plasma levels of IFN\u2010\u03bb3 at all the time points tested correlated positively with the percentage of CD56dimCD16+ cells expressing NKG2A (P = 0.0032, r = 0.3944) (Fig. 2B). However, there was no significant correlation when plasma levels of IFN\u2010\u03bb3 at the early acute (P = 0.3528) or the late acute phase (P = 0.1215) were examined separately (data not shown). When individuals were stratified by their IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype, the positive correlation between NKG2A expression and plasma IFN\u2010\u03bb3 remained significant only in those with the CC genotype for CD56dimCD16+ (P = 0.0015, r = 0.5460) (Fig. 2C) and CD56brightCD16\u2212 (P = 0.0378, r = 0.3748) (Supplemental Fig. S2A) subsets. The expression of NKG2A on both CD56dimCD16+ (P = 0.014) and CD56brightCD16\u2212 (P = 0.009) NK cells decreased at the follow\u2010up time point following viral clearance in resolvers as we had previously described 17 (Fig. 2D and Supplemental Fig. S2B). Longitudinal data per patient from the resolver group is presented in Figure 2F demonstrates the full dynamics of NKG2A modulation before, during, and after acute HCV. Data for subjects with the CC genotype within the resolver group are represented in Figure 2G. When all acute HCV patients were stratified by IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype, reduced NKG2A expression on the CD56dimCD16+ NK cells at the follow\u2010up time point remained significant only in individuals having the CC genotype (P = 0.028) (Fig. 2E). In HD, carriage of the CC IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype was also associated with low NKG2A expression (P = 0.0035) suggesting a correlation between this genotype and lower NKG2A expression (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that decreased expression of NKG2A on NK cells, a marker of acute resolving HCV, was associated with lower IFN\u2010\u03bb3 levels and the CC genotype.",

As previously described during early acute HCV 17, we confirmed an increase in the capacity of CD56dimCD16+ to degranulate in individuals that resolved the infection (P = 0.011) (Fig. 3A). Longitudinal data per patient from the resolver group presented in Figure 3B demonstrates the full dynamics of CD107a expression before, during, and after acute HCV. This was not accompanied by an increase in the production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 but its stabilization in the majority of patients confirming the documented dissociation between these two functions 12, 36 (Fig. 3C and D). Progressive decrease in IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by CD56dimCD16+ NK subset during the progression from acute to the follow up phase was characteristic of infections progressing to chronicity (P = 0.002) (Fig. 3D). Similar results were observed for the CD56brightCD16\u2212 subset upon progression from early to late acute infection (P = 0.033) (Supplemental Fig. S4A). When individuals with chronic evolution were stratified by IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype, those with CC IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype exhibited a trend similar to that observed in spontaneous resolvers with significantly higher production or rather stabilization of IFN\u2010\u03b3 by CD56dimCD16+ subset during the early acute phase (P = 0.040) (Fig. 3E). This effect was less evident when all patients were considered (Fig. 3F). This was not observed for the CD56brightCD16\u2212 subset (Supplemental Fig. S4B). Finally, there was no correlation between viral load, serum ALT or the function of NK cells as was previously described 17 (data not shown). In summary, despite stabilization of IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by NK cells during early acute infection in individuals carrying the favorable CC genotype, suggesting an overall better NK cell function, this was not sufficient to control viral replication and many of these individuals developed persistent infection. This suggests that IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype may influence NK cell function during acute HCV but other factors may contribute to determine the outcome of the infection.",

However, we did not observe any statistically significant differences between patient groups for IFN\u2010\u03bb1 plasma levels as in the chimpanzee model 6. It is possible that our results were skewed by the use of estimated date of the infection as compared to chimpanzee studies where timing of the infection was clearly documented. Our results are in agreement with the results of Langhans et al. 8 who did not observe significant differences in neither IL28B/IFN\u2010\u03bb3 nor IL\u201029/IFN\u2010\u03bb1 in individuals with acute HCV as compared to healthy donors, although in that study acutely infected individuals with the CC genotype still exhibited higher levels of both cytokines as compared to TT and CT genotypes 8. We had previously reported that our cohort of PWIDs of a French Canadian origin had a higher representation of the CC and CT genotypes and reduced representation of the TT genotype as compared to other cohorts due probably to a strong genetic founder effect in that population 33. As such, we had very few subjects in the present study who were homozygous for the non\u2010favorable T allele (TT), so we had to group our TT subjects with the heterozygote CT subjects in one category as *T which may have influenced some of the results.

This may also explain why individuals with the CC IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype have better prognosis following acute infection. Interestingly, it was previously reported that infected patients carrying the non\u2010favorable IFN\u2010\u03bb3 TT allele expressed higher levels of NKG2A on effector NK cells before beginning peg\u2010IFN therapy and levels of expression correlated with reduced sustained viral response (SVR) rates 41.

Similarly, stimulation of NK cells with IFN\u2010\u03bb3 did not enhance NK cell degranulation of IFN\u2010\u03b3 production as was also recently reported 42. Nevertheless, carrying the favorable CC genotype was associated with higher levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by NK cells during early acute infection in individuals who went chronic.

KIR and IFN\u2010\u03bb3 polymorphisms additively predict the response to HCV IFN\u2010based therapies 20 but given the limited number of patients in this study, we could not examine this correlation. Another key factor is the expression of the specific IL28R\u03b1/ IFN\u03bbR1 on NK cells that has been a controversial issue. Overall, we observed low levels of receptor expression on NK cells and unlike hepatocytes 37 this expression was not modulated by stimulation with either IFN\u2010\u03b1 or IFN\u2010\u03bb3. Furthermore, IFN\u2010\u03bb3 cytokine did not directly stimulate degranulation or IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by NK cells. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that IFN\u2010\u03bb3 may regulate NK cell differentiation or other functions. Indeed, IL28R was required for optimal NK cell activity in vivo 29. Additional assays are required to precisely assess the responsiveness of NK cells or other IL28R\u03b1 expressing cells to IFN\u2010\u03bb3. Indeed, DCs and monocytes were shown to prime the activation of NK cells through direct interaction and/or production of different cytokines like IL\u201012 45, 46. When we examined expression of IL28R\u03b1 on different lymphocyte populations, we observed higher expression of this receptor on DCs and monocytes as compared to NK cells prior to stimulation with IFN\u2010\u03bb3 or IFN\u2010\u03b1, but there was no change in the level of expression following the stimulation. Recent reports suggest that IL\u201012 and/or IL\u201018 production by monocyte\u2010derived macrophages could act as the link between type III IFNs and activation of NK cells 26 and that this effect may be IFN\u2010\u03bb3 genotype dependent 47.
