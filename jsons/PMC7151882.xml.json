However, many individuals who work part-time or full-time with animals may receive little or no preventive health services related to their work exposures. For example, staff at pet swap meets, pet store employees, volunteers at zoos and county fair animal exhibits, wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife biologists, volunteer animal rescue workers, individuals engaged in home slaughter of animals for family consumption, and subsistence (bushmeat) hunters may all face significant \u201coccupational\u201d health risks related to their contact with animals, yet may never receive preplacement examinations, prophylactic vaccinations, or follow-up surveillance examinations to prevent or detect work-related disease. If they do see a medical provider for care of a work-related injury or illness, that medical provider may not be aware of the range of health risks these workers face, and therefore the treatment or recommendations for prevention may not be optimal.",

The veterinarian is the source of knowledge about relevant animal diseases and the necessary procedures of animal handling and typically has regular contact with the animals, the workplace, and the animal workers. In animal research facilities, the veterinarian is often the administrative supervisor of the animal care workers. In veterinary hospitals the veterinarian may be both the chief clinician and the practice director. For wildlife rehabilitation facilities, animal shelters, zoos, and many other settings, the consulting veterinarian may be the principal point of contact with the medical providers as well as the chief source of medical information about occupational health and safety hazards of the workplace. The veterinarian may be the health professional who is most familiar to the workers and with whom the workers have established a trusting relationship. The veterinarian may also be in regular contact with the employer or worksite supervisor and be able to advocate for the provision of occupational health services for the workers. For all these reasons the veterinarian may be the most appropriate professional to assemble and help lead the occupational health team as well as ensure that the services provided to workers are appropriate for the work setting.",

For example, occupational cases of Campylobacter and Chlamydophila psittaci infection have been documented among poultry workers15,\n16 and reported human plague cases have been reported among veterinary staff attending to infected cats.17 With the increasing focus on emerging infectious diseases, it should be remembered that many such diseases appear first or with greatest intensity in the occupational setting. The first recognized (index) human case for the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that began in China was a chef who had extensive exposure to wild game animals in his work.18 Nipah virus, another deadly emerging viral pathogen, first broke out among Malaysian pig farm workers.19 Human outbreaks of Ebola virus infection in Africa are believed to originate at least in part from exposures to nonhuman primates and other wildlife during bushmeat hunting and butchering.20 A strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has caused fatal work-related infection in a veterinarian, and human cases of H5N1 HPAI remain strongly associated with working in animal markets, poultry rearing, slaughtering, defeathering, and preparing infected birds for consumption.21 Rift Valley fever, another emerging viral disease, often occurs in human beings as an occupational disease among herdsmen engaged in activities such as assisting with cattle birthing and caring for sick animals.22\n",

            "text": "A hazard related to work around areas of bird or bat droppings is the exposure to potentially pathogenic fungi including Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, and Blastomyces. Histoplasma capsulatum is a fungus that exists in two forms: a mold form in the soil environment and a yeast form that develops when human beings or other animals inhale or ingest the spores. Although many infected human beings are asymptomatic, some may develop complications ranging from mild flulike illness to chronic lung and eye infections and pericarditis.29 Skin infection can also occur. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk of severe disease. The nutrients in bird or bat guano can encourage the growth of spores in the environment. Therefore areas of pigeon and other bird roosting where bird droppings accumulate may be more likely to have high levels of H. capsulatum spores that can lead to inhalation or ingestion by human beings. Poultry litter can also contain Histoplasma spores. Farmers, construction workers, forestry workers, and other workers exposed to disturbed soil or poultry guano can be at risk of infection, especially if individuals are immunocompromised. Unlike birds, bats appear to shed infectious Histoplasma in their droppings. Caves and other areas where bat guano accumulates have been associated with human cases of histoplasmosis.30 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has published guidelines for reduction of occupational risk of Histoplasma infection that also can be applied to the risk of other fungal pathogens such as Cryptococcus and Blastomyces. These guidelines include the use of respiratory protection, disposable protective clothing and shoe coverings, and gloves that avoid skin trauma to reduce the risk of skin infection. The types of respirators that should be worn during occupational activities with exposures to spore-contaminated dusts depend on intensity of exposure. In low-risk situations (e.g., site surveys of bird roosts), disposable, filtering facepiece respirators may be adequate, whereas extremely dusty work such as removing accumulated bird or bat manure from an enclosed area such as a barn or attic may require full-facepiece, powered air-purifying respirators.31\n",

Taking an occupational health approach to such hazards involves using a hierarchy of controls that range from most effective to least effective methods to reduce the health risks to workers. This hierarchy is listed in Table 12-2\n. Many hazards can be eliminated at the source, or a less-dangerous substance or process can be substituted. Engineering controls include physical methods to reduce exposures such as improved ventilation and use of nonporous surfaces on counters that can be easily disinfected. Administrative and work practice controls involve job restrictions for susceptible persons, limiting individual worker exposure times in high-exposure areas, and preventive practices such as hand hygiene. Reliance on personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, and respirators is considered to be the least effective and often most cumbersome approach to hazard control.",

Although they may require a greater up-front investment, controls at the top of the hierarchy, such as elimination, substitution, or engineering controls, may be most cost effective at preventing work-related health problems. For example, eliminating a zoonotic disease (such as brucellosis) in an animal population through vaccination and other preventive veterinary care may be more cost effective over time than relying on personal protective equipment such as respirators and gloves for animal workers. Similarly, substituting a less-toxic cleaning agent (see Chapter 8) may be more cost effective in reducing health complaints of eye and throat irritation among exposed workers than the use of gloves and respirators.",

Large-animal veterinarians were concerned about ringworm, gastrointestinal bacteria, leptospirosis, brucellosis, gastrointestinal parasites, and rabies.

Recommended work practice controls include training new employees in practices such as hand hygiene before and after each patient encounter and after contact with body fluids, secretions, or excretions as well as after eating, drinking, smoking, using lavatories, and cleaning animal areas. Additional work practices include bite prevention and avoidance of needlesticks by not recapping needles. Bite prevention could include physical or chemical restraints, muzzles, and bite-resistant gloves. Personal protective equipment recommendations include gloves or sleeves and facial protection with a mask or goggles when splashes or sprays are expected. An N-95 respirator should be worn when evaluating abortions in small ruminants, poultry deaths, sick psittacine birds, and other situations with the risk of aerosolized pathogens.41 The NASPHV document also recommends that immunocompromised individuals and pregnant workers be counseled about their increased risk of zoonotic disease, especially when working with high-risk animals such as young animals and animals that are parturient, unvaccinated, stray or feral, housed in shelters or crowded conditions, fed raw meat diets, or with parasites; wildlife; reptiles and amphibians; and exotic or nonnative species.41 Such counseling should ideally be done by a health care professional who is aware of the zoonotic disease risks faced by the worker. For this reason the NASPHV document recommends that all workers inform their health care providers of their work activities, but additional direct communication between a health care provider and a veterinarian about disease risks may be advisable. However, as previously mentioned, such communication needs to respect patient privacy and confidentiality of medical information (see Chapter 2).",

In such situations use of a zoonotic disease risk card (see Figure 12-3) may help guide the medical care provider to adequately consider zoonotic disease risks. Care of animal bites in veterinary workers involves a review of rabies risk from the bite and rabies vaccination status (see Chapter 9), as well as consideration of antibiotic treatment.",

In other areas, gloves and masks are advisable when handling rodents. Hunters should use adequate hearing protection while hunting and impermeable gloves while preparing carcasses.",
