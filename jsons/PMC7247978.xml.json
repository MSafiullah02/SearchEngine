[1] At hospital admission; most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Abdominal pain, myalgia, diarrhea, sore throat, fatigue and loss of smell are other possible symptoms. The diagnosis is made by real time reverse transciption polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharingeal swab. [2]\n",

The patient was admitted to the inpatient COVID-19 clinic with a pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 pnemonia. Appropriate treatment with hydroxychloroquine, oseltamivir and ceftriaxone were started. Multiple X-rays of the lungs were obtained to evaluate the lung involvement, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. General condition of the patient improved day by day.

COVID-19 primarily spreads by small droplets during close contact. [2] The median incubation period was reported as 4 days.

Thus, the lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19. [6]\n",

Atypical imaging features have been reported as bronchial wall thickening, pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy.
