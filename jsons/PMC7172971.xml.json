Regardless of age, those with high-risk conditions have increased rates of hospitalization and death (Figure).\n7, 8 Thus, high-risk patients aged 45 to 64 years have a risk equivalent to that of all patients aged more than 65 years.7 Because of the high incidence of occult cardiopulmonary disease in older persons, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has extended its vaccination recommendation to include all persons more than 50 years old.9 For patients aged more than 65 years, high-risk conditions are particularly dangerous. According to one clinical prediction rule, those at highest risk demonstrate a 30-fold greater risk of influenza-related hospitalization or death than otherwise healthy elderly persons.10\n",

Soon all appeared seriously ill, with extreme dyspnea and cyanosis. Findings on physical examination included diffuse rales and wheezing. Laboratory studies demonstrated leukocytosis and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Bacteriologic studies were negative, and sputum samples did not induce bacterial peritonitis when injected into rodents. Radiographs revealed diffuse infiltrates that mimicked pulmonary congestion. Mortality was 80%.22 During interpandemic periods, patients with influenza pneumonia are more likely to have underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and mortality is 6% to 29%.23, 24 Pathologic findings in pure influenza pneumonia include necrotizing bronchitis, hyaline membranes, intra-alveolar hemorrhage and edema, and interstitial inflammation\u2014changes identical to those seen with acute respiratory distress-like syndrome associated with influenza pneumonia in 1918.25\n",

Illness occurs after an incubation of 3 to 8 days; initial symptoms include high fever and lower respiratory symptoms.26, 27 Cough, which may be productive, is common and hemoptysis has been described. Severe dyspnea and respiratory distress are noted within 1 week. Complete blood count often shows leucopenia and thrombocytopenia.27 The most common x-ray presentation is patchy or interstitial infiltrates, and infrequently, pleural effusion. Adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction are seen in patients with severe illness and often precede death. Postmortem investigations confirm that death is most commonly associated with diffuse lung injury.26, 27 Vascular congestion and formation of hyaline membranes are noted.

Indeed, data from 2 cohort studies54, 55 demonstrated that vaccinated high-risk persons had lower mortality before, during, and after influenza season, and that adjusting for diagnosis code variables did not affect this relationship. In a companion case-control study,56 adjusting for functional status as identified through chart review negated the mortality effects of influenza vaccination, whereas adjustment for diagnosis codes enhanced the effect of vaccination. Although influenza vaccination undoubtedly provides some benefit for the elderly, more research needs to be done on ways to improve the efficacy in older persons. Potential methods include alternative modes of delivery, immune adjuvants, strategies for indirect protection through immunization of family and caregivers, and greater use of antiviral medications.57 Immunization of health care workers is particularly important because influenza is common in this group58 but often unrecognized,59 and vaccination of health care workers has been associated with decreased mortality among patients in long-term care facilities.60, 61\n",
