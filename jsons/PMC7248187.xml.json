            "text": "In late 2019, a novel human coronavirus, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered in Wuhan (China), in cases of fatal pneumonia [1]. Coronaviruses are known to induce a wide range of pathology ranging from common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome. Most of the viruses present in the family of Coronaviridae are known to induce primarily self-limited upper respiratory diseases with the exceptions of two Betacoronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The former was responsible for a pandemic of viral pneumonia which began in the Guangdong province (China) in late 2002 and peaked globally in the early 2003. The latter was discovered in 2012 and was responsible for cases of fatal viral pneumonia mainly in the Arabic peninsula, especially in Saudi Arabia. In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was related to cases of fatal viral pneumonia. Since then, the virus rapidly spread worldwide and caused a new pandemic. To date, only limited data is available regarding the lung pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2. Forensic investigations continue to be necessary during COVID-19 pandemic when the manner of death is violent or undetermined. In mid-March 2020, our Center was confronted for the first time to the case of a potentially infected young woman who collapsed at home during confinement. No specific diagnosis was made before death. We present here the results of an exceptional case of forensic autopsy, showing extremely severe lung lesions of a COVID-19 disease diagnosed on post-mortem samples. This is to our knowledge, the first forensic autopsy performed on a young woman who died at home during confinement and was later diagnosed with COVID-19 disease.",

Autopsy staff was reduced to a minimum (resident, supervisor, and technician) with transfer airlock adjacent to the autopsy room. The staff was adequately trained and wore appropriate personnel protective equipment (surgical scrub suit, surgical hat, eye protection glasses, FFP3 mask, waterproof gown including forearms, rubber boots, and cut-resistant gloves).",

In the alveolar exudate, there were also moderate amount of intra-alveolar macrophages (Fig. 2c) and only scant polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and lymphocytes. Focal areas of intraalveaolar hemorrhage and bacterial proliferation were also present. No viral inclusions or giant multinucleated cells were noted. Interstitial compartment showed edema, vascular stasis, lympho-monocytic infiltrates (majority of T lymphocytes (CD3+, Fig. 2d) over monocytes and exempt of B lymphocytes (CD20+)), and abundant megakaryocytes. Within the alveolar septa and mainly into the capillaries, abundant PMN were also seen, indicating margination and diapedesis. No signs of increased collagen deposition within the alveoli or the intersitium were noticed (Masson trichrome stain). Bronchi and bronchioles showed only minimal lymphocytic infiltrates within their walls and did not display any sign of mucosal necrosis. Histological analysis of other organs showed mild chronic tracheitis and microabscesses in the liver parenchyma. At microscopy, we did not observe any signs of cardiac hypertrophy.",

To date, only few data regarding SARS-CoV-2-related lung pathology are available [3\u20135] and mainly based on surgical material [5], post-mortem biopsies [4], or minimal invasive autopsy [3]. To our knowledge, we report here the first case of a forensic autopsy of a young COVID-19 fatality diagnosed at necropsy without any medical intervention interfering with the natural evolution of the disease. Lung pathology revealed DAD and interstitial pneumonia. The pattern of injury was geographically heterogeneous affecting primarily central parts of the lungs and preserving the peripheral parts. An early phase of secondary bacterial infection was noticed within the alveoli, with margination of PMNs. Abundant megakaryocytes can also be explained by the early stage of infection, reflecting release of hemopoietic cells by the bone marrow. However, according to the post-mortem biochemistry, death was attributed to pulmonary changes related to SARS-CoV-2 and high fever without implication of a secondary bacterial infection (low procalcitonin value).",

Some features were however different, such as the absence of multinucleated syncytial cells [3\u20135], fibroblastic plugs [5], or hyaline thrombi in microvessels [3]. The lesions induced by SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those caused by other members of the Coronaviridae family, especially the Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV [6, 7] and MERS-CoV [8]. One particular element we observed was the complete absence of B lymphocytes within the interstitial compartment despite the lympho-monocytic infiltrate. This finding is in line with the idea that the immune response in the lung parenchyma is mainly mediated by T lymphocytes [9]. However, whether this feature is also present in other cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection or in other types of Betacoronaviruses lung infections remains unclear.",
