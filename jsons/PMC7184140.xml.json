India has a huge population of >1.3 billion people, and cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune harbor millions of people who rely on public transportation. The government has aggressively promoted social distancing to minimize the spread of this virus.",

For example, the Sealdha station alone receives 1.8 million passengers, and most are from low- and middle-income families that depend on intracity transportation. Such close contact among people in highly crowded areas is potentially catastrophic for community spread of the virus. In response to this crisis, the government has created expert groups to tackle the practical problems on the ground. For example, both international and domestic flights have been grounded.2\n",

Several days are required to obtain test results. In addition, false-positive and false-negative results can occur and must be carefully avoided. The country\u2019s elite Indian Council of Medical Research should create more detection and observation centers to facilitate a more rapid testing process. Through agencies such the National Institute of Virology in Pune, the government has tried to bring factual awareness regarding the virus and to eliminate the spread of false information via social media. However, this effort needs support from all healthcare NGOs to encourage people to remain calm and to act rationally.",

Due to the shortage of products, goods are either unavailable in drug stores or are sold at high prices, beyond the budget of low- and middle-income households. Similarly, hand sanitizer is scarce in drug stores. Even though the government is educating people to use masks and hand sanitizer, the shortage of materials is a concern that must be dealt with swiftly.",

Violators are prosecuted by law, and adhering to strict discipline has become a crucial mandate. Furthermore, spraying alcohol on roads, vehicles, public trains, and personnel to disinfectant people has no value. Vast quantities of alcohol spray are detrimental to human health.4 Health education must provide advice based on scientific evidence. The spread of unscientific information (eg, drinking cow urine to counter the coronavirus) must be totally stopped. Close monitoring to facilitate a better understanding of the epidemiology and transmission pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus across all states is vital. The government needs to consider the effectiveness of public health policies in terms of their social implications in practice.5",

The prime minster also initiated a disaster fund for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) block nations to assist neighboring nations. Within India, several states have allocated a special fund to deal with the pandemic. On March 25, 2020, a total lockdown of all states across the nation was undertaken for 21 days to control the community spread of the virus. The World Health Organization has praised India\u2019s response. India should continue the massive efforts against the SARS-CoV-2 virus along with the already successful \u201cClean India\u201d campaign promoted by the prime minister because adopting better hygiene may contribute to minimizing the spread of this dangerous pandemic.",
