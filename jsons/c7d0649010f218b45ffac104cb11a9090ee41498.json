The biological processes (BPs) are shown ordered by their significance in the COVID19vsHealthy. In spite of the larger number of DEGs in the COVID-19-infected lung (815), there are only 7 significant biological processes involved, which may indicate a more coordinated, systemic response. In contrast, the changes in the NHBE cells are characterized by fewer DEGs (only 223) but span more uncoordinated biological processes. This is illustrated in Fig. S2 which shows the BPs ordered in the order of significance in the NHBECoV2vsMock.

The first appears to be triggered by STAT2 and IRF9, which have 16 common target genes that are also all significantly upregulated (IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, IFITM3, OAS1, OAS3, OAS2, MX1, MX2, RSAD2, OASL, XAF1, IRF2, IRF7).

IRF9 is a regulator of type I IFN signaling and is known to interact with STAT2 [9] and STAT1 to form the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex (ISGF3) that binds to interferonstimulated response elements (ISREs) to induce the expression of Interferon stimulated genes (ISG).

Once we identified the main regulatory pathways potentially associated with hyper-inflammation we evaluated in silico FDA-approved drugs that could show activity on multiple components of inflammation and consequently could be used for the management of severe COVID-19 cases. We considered the number of DE genes that would be reverted by each drug, as well as calculated a Bonferroni-corrected p-value indicating the suitability of each drug for repurposing in COVID-19 based on two different approaches (see methods). We looked for drugs that have both small p-values as well as revert a larger number of DE genes. The top three drugs drug identified by our analysis are shown in Fig. 1 . Methylprednisolone is the drug that was identified as the most likely to work. This drug targets 27 genes that are found to be DE in COVID19vsHealthy. Out of these 27 genes, the drug would revert the changes in 25 of them. The drug also had an extremely significant p-value (p = 5.72 \u221210 ) even after a Bonferroni correction which is the most stringent correction available. Methylprednisolone also reverted 22 out of 22 genes found to be DE in NHBECoV2vsMock, and 25 out of 26 genes found to be DE in A549CoV2vsMock. Fig. 2 shows the mechanism through methylprednisolone acts on the DE genes in COVID19vsHealthy, and how these genes influence the BPs found to be significantly impacted.",

The study used a quasi-experimental design with 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-corticosteroid groups, respectively. The primary end point was composed of escalation to ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in post-methylprednisolone group compared to pre-methylprednisolone group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). The treatment effect was observed for each individual component of the composite endpoint. Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-methylprednisolone group (8 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). There was also an independent reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (OR=0.45: 95% CI [0.25-0.81]).

From those, prednisone would revert only 1 of the 3 DE genes in the COVID19vsHealthy and 0 out of the 2 in the NHBECoV2vsMock. Both yielded insignificant p-values (p = 1 after Bonferroni) suggesting that prednisone is not expected to be an effective treatment. Prednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone belong to the same family of corticosteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and there is also a structural similarity between them (see Fig. S14 ). In spite of this structural similarity, hydrocortisone would only revert 8 out of 10 genes found to be DE in the COVID19vsHealthy (p = 0.57 after FDR) and 5 out of 8 genes found to be DE in the NHBECoV2vsMock (p = 0.038 after FDR, p = 1 after Bonferroni).

The network is a directed graph in which the source node represents either a chemical substance or compound, a drug, or a toxicant (CDT). We focused our work on FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed. The edges represent known increase or decrease expression effects that these CDTs have on various genes. The analysis considers the hypothesis that a drug would revert the measured gene expression changes . Full details are included in Supplementary Materials. 7 All rights reserved.
