Bilevel positive airway pressure (bilevel PAP) and nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are well-established noninvasive treatments for infants with more severe respiratory distress.4 Currently these treatments require mechanical ventilators or dedicated bilevel PAP machines, neither of which are readily available in resource-limited settings.3",

The device utilizes a variable buoyancy float, which captures the bubbles from bubble CPAP. This energy is used to change the effective water column depth and cycle between a low- and high-pressure level. In comparison with bubble CPAP, the device has minimal increase in user complexity and estimated cost. Promising results of bench testing in an inanimate model have been previously reported.5,6 Here we report the results of in vivo testing of bubble bilevel ventilation using this device in deeply anesthetized rabbits. Our aim was to test the ability of bubble bilevel ventilation to provide pressures comparable to a conventional mechanical ventilator with appropriate gas exchange as demonstrated by arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.",

            "text": "The NeoVent consists of an oscillatory valve, which uses the bubbles of bubble CPAP to power cycling between two levels of pressure. In the low-pressure state, bubbles emerge from proximal holes in the submerged expiratory limb of tubing. As in the case of bubble CPAP, this submerged depth of bubbling determines the pressure. A float collects these bubbles, becomes buoyant and rises. In the process, the float pulls up an attached sleeve, which occludes the proximal holes. The air column is forced to travel deeper in the water, to a depth proportional to the value set by a pressure regulator valve external to the water. The float then vents the bubbles, becomes heavy and sinks. The attached sleeve slides down, opening the proximal holes; bubbling from the proximal holes resumes and the pressure decreases to the lower level. This process cyclically repeats, resulting in a controllable bilevel pressure waveform. The levels of pressure are set hydrostatically and can be visually verified by the depth of the water column, similar to bubble CPAP. Specifically, filling the container with additional water increases the low-pressure level while removing water decreases the low-pressure level. The pressure regulator valve can be adjusted to determine the depth to which the air column travels, setting the high level of pressure. (Both low- and high-pressure levels can be adjusted without interrupting device function or introducing contaminants to the water.) The rate of cycling between both pressures is set by the airflow rate; at a high airflow rate, the float becomes buoyant more quickly, decreasing the overall cycling time. Note that the high-pressure level, low-pressure level and cycling rate can all be set independently (Fig. 1).",

An uncuffed endotracheal tube of 3.0 mm inner diameter was inserted in the trachea and secured with a tie. The carotid artery was cannulated to obtain samples for blood gas analysis.
