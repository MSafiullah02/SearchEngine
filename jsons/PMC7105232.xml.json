However, a trend related to older age in hBoV-infected children than in RSV-infected was observed in previous studies.6, 10, 11The proportion of RV infections (12.4%) in Taiwan is slightly lower than that reported from the USA (16%) and Spain (17.4%),6, 12 but higher than that from Italy (8.8%).10 The prevalence rate of hMPV (14.4%) in this study was higher than in most previous reports (1.7\u20139%),6, 10, 12 except in the report byXepapadaki et al13 (16%).",
