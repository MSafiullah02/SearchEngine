            "text": "\nBabesia microti in North America and B. divergens in Europe are transmitted by tick bite. Symptoms of babesiosis range from mild to severe illness with a hemolysis and fever, and infection lasting more than a year can occur. RBCs are the site of replication. More than 50 cases of transfusion transmission of babesiosis have occurred in the US, with an estimated risk of up to 1 in 1000 in parts of Connecticut. Furthermore, PCR studies reveal that \u223c1 in 1800 donors in Connecticut are parasitemic. Transfusion transmitted disease occurs with fever developing 1\u20134 weeks after transfusion; this may be associated with chills, headache, hemolysis, hemoglobinuria and, rarely, life-threatening hemolytic anemia, renal failure and coagulopathy. Asplenic, elderly or severely immunocompromised patients are at risk for more severe infection. Donor selection is currently used to prevent transfusion transmission, including not collecting blood in areas where the disease vectors are endemic during the spring and summer months. Future strategies to prevent disease transmission, especially in high-risk areas, potentially include serologic or NAT testing.",

            "text": "There are three forms of leishmaniasis: cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral (kala-azar). The organism is transmitted through the bite of sandflies, with each Leishmania species restricted to a particular Phlebotomus species. The reservoir for the organism includes rodents and small wild mammals. The lifecycle is split between the sandfly and the mammal. In the human the organism invades the reticuloendothelial system, where it replicates and then is released back into the blood. Parasitemia is generally transient and of low levels, and therefore the risk of transfusion transmission is low. Outside of the US, transfusion transmission of L. donovani, which causes visceral leishmaniasis, has been reported. Veterans who served in the Persian Gulf are deferred from donating for 1 year upon leaving.\n",

            "text": "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was initially described in cattle in the UK in 1986. BSE was transmitted through the food chain through meat or bone meal. A ban on ruminant protein in cattle feed has resulted in decreased incidence of BSE. In 1995, BSE was transmitted to humans through the food chain and resulted in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the UK. vCJD differs from classical CJD by an earlier age of onset, slower disease progression, and higher levels of PrPSc in the brain. The disease presents with behavioral changes and dysasthesia, and progresses to cerebellar ataxia, dementia and death in 7\u201338 months. The majority of cases of vCJD have appeared in the UK, but there have also been reports in other European countries. At least four cases of transfusion transmission of vCJD have occurred in the UK. It is estimated that transfusion transmission by donors who develop vCJD within several years of donation is about 14% for recipients who survive longer than 5 years posttransfusion. Prevention includes deferral for donors who have resided in the UK or Europe for over 6 months, and the use of filters to remove prions; these remove approximately half the infectivity.",
