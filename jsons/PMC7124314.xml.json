In his classic treatise on this subject, Hans Zinsser noted that \u201c\u2026 epidemics\u2026 have often determined victory or defeat before the generals knew where they were going to place the headquarters' mess\u201d (1). The disappearance of whole cultures, e.g., native inhabitants of the Americas, is but the most pronounced example of population changes wrought by disease. Microbes have left an imprint on economics, literature, medicine, and virtually every aspect of human society. They caused the abandonment of some religions and the acceptance of others and exposed our prejudices and superstitions (2, 3, 4). The discussion below provides some examples of events in which disease has actually changed human history.",

Assyria was the largest and most powerful empire of its time and, led by King Sennacherib, its army had conquered much of the Near East. In 701 B.C., Jerusalem was an intended Assyrian conquest (6). Inscriptions on the walls of Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh, in agreement with histories of the period, proclaim that by the use of ramps, battering rams, mines, and other military techniques, his army had occupied 46 walled cities in the kingdom of Judah. Thus, there is strong reason to believe that had the engagement proceeded as planned, Jerusalem also would have fallen. During the siege, however, a large number of Assyrian soldiers died, and Sennacherib apparently judged that Jerusalem was not worth the price exacted by a lethal illness. In addition, a deteriorating situation in Babylonia required the attention of the Assyrian army (7), and thus, the siege was ended. Reasons for the mortality included the possibility that the defenders within Jerusalem had somehow prevented the Assyrians from getting access to good water (5) or that food poisoning was responsible (6), and it was the ingestion of pathogens that exposed them to widespread fatal infections.",

The age was primarily golden for Athenians but much less so for citizens of surrounding states. Pericles, leader of Athens in 444 B.C., embarked on ambitious programs in the arts, literature, and architecture, leading to development of a grand society. At Pericles' direction, however, all construction was within Athens, e.g., the Parthenon and other monuments of the Acropolis. Athenians thus gained the benefit of these works and the jobs they provided, but surrounding states were forced to pay the cost of the projects. This policy ultimately resulted in a revolt by Sparta and other cities of the Peloponnese peninsula, and the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 B.C.",

Athens' offensive tactics made use of its powerful navy's ability to strike at targets of its choosing. Sparta did ravage the areas around Athens, but according to Pericles' plan, Athenians were safe (at least from military attack) within their walls.",

Since the disease was endemic in Haiti, and children get only a mild form of it, the native population enjoyed relative immunity. French troops, on the other hand, closely packed and whose immune systems had never seen this virus, were completely defenseless against the full fury of the disease. The great majority (27,000) of the French troops sent to Haiti died of yellow fever, including Napoleon's brother-in-law who headed the expedition (34). The small remainder of the force left, and Haiti remained independent. Napoleon lost interest in the Western Hemisphere, offered the sale of the Louisiana Territory, and turned his attention back to Europe.",

The force of 40,000 soldiers, ferried by hundreds of ships, was, however, no match for a disease believed to be malaria. Napoleon, knowing of the illness that was endemic in that area each summer, wrote to one of his commanders: \u201cDo not attempt to come to blows with the English. \u2026We must oppose the English with nothing but fever\u201d (36).",
