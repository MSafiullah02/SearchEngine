For example, not long after the widespread introduction of penicillin, cases of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were reported.5 Decades later, resistant strains would become a major cause of morbidity and mortality both in healthcare settings and ultimately community settings. This emergence of antimicrobial resistance repeated itself many times over in the years to come, with many other antibiotics and for a wide range of pathogens. At the same time, ambitious programs to eliminate malaria suffered setbacks for a variety of reasons in various parts of the world.6 Similarly, some mass vaccination programs failed to meet their original goals.",

Some of these diseases were not new but had not yet been appreciated, due to limitations in diagnostic testing. For example, the causative agent for Legionnaire's disease was identified after an outbreak in 1976; however, the disease had most likely caused outbreaks of atypical cases of pneumonia for years. Other newly identified pathogens like HIV and hepatitis C were associated with a dramatic increase of morbidity and mortality around the world, while other diseases like dengue emerged in new geographic locations. Other pathogens have re-emerged after decades of decline. Vaccine-preventable diseases like mumps and pertussis have also re-emerged and so has tuberculosis. In fact, there may have been more people living with tuberculosis in the first decade of the 21st century than at any time in history.3 Finally, the increasing resistance of many pathogens to antimicrobial agents has hinted that we may enter a post-antibiotic era for some difficult-to-treat infections. This threat was highlighted by the recent spread of infections caused by highly resistant gram-negative bacteria capable of producing New Delhi metallo-B-lactamase (NDM-1) enzyme, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.7\n",

Travel increased, human behavior changed, and in some parts of the world people came into closer contact with animals, as human populations moved into new habitats. The way food was produced and transported also changed. More intensive animal farming practices made food cheaper but kept more animals in smaller spaces. Also, agricultural practices encroached into new regions, increasing the chances of spillover of pathogens.8 Now, food is often produced hundreds if not thousands of miles from the point of consumption. The resulting product specialization, large-scale farming and production lots and global distribution enable food-based outbreaks to spread quickly around the globe,9 and also make it difficult to determine the original source of an outbreak.",

Agriculture allowed people to stay in one place, and increased food production caused the population density to expand far beyond levels that could be sustained by hunting and gathering alone. This growth in population density provided a critical mass of people to sustain and spread contagious infectious diseases.2, 12 Also, some agricultural practices, specifically the domestication of animals, increased human and animal interactions, as well as interactions between different animal species. This cross-species mixing provided the ideal conditions for the evolution of new infectious diseases.2, 12 Subsequent historical developments involving trade, war and migration created a means for spreading disease outbreaks to new populations around the world.13\n",

As the population moved from the countryside into the cities to work in the new factories, migrants experienced over-crowding, longer working hours and a poorer diet compared to their contemporaries in rural communities. Smallpox, typhus and tuberculosis were endemic in cities. Child mortality was high from diseases like measles, mumps, pertussis and scarlet fever. Before the widespread introduction of modern sewage systems in the late 19th century, sewage often contaminated water supplies directly. Cleaner water supplies eradicated cholera in Britain and the United States, but poor sanitation still leads to the spread of cholera in many parts of the world.",

The resulting increase in travel now means that infections can move across continents in a matter of days rather than weeks or months. Thus, the closeness between populations and infectious diseases can no longer be measured in terms of geographic distance, and the factors that drive emerging infectious diseases in one part of the world can affect other parts of the world very quickly. Similarly, the pursuit of natural resources and sources of food have put people into close contact with new species, increasing the chance for disease spillover (Figure 4-1\n),8, 17 which when coupled with the ease with which both people and diseases can travel, has created an unprecedented opportunity for new diseases to emerge and spread.14\n",

However, the large environmental changes that increased the likelihood of humans becoming infected with new pathogens escalated when farmers started domesticating animals and tilling their fields over 10 000 years ago.12 Even today, in some parts of the world, humans are brought very close to animals, as a result of not only farming approaches, but also processing and selling animals.18 Situations in which multiple species live in close proximity increase the likelihood that new infections can emerge and spread to humans. In fact, a majority of all emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in nature.19, 20 The regions that are at high risk for producing emerging infectious diseases feature populations that have more frequent interactions between humans and other animals.17, 20 Risks of disease emergence may be especially high where and when changes in land use occur, that is when intensified agricultural approaches spread into previously uncultivated ecosystems.9 The emergence of Nipah virus in the 1990s in Malaysia provides an example of an emerging infectious disease associated with a change in land use. Pig farms were established close to tropical forests, and the virus spread from fruit bats to pigs and then to pig farmers.2, 21 Efforts to control this outbreak resulted in the culling of over a million pigs.21 When forests and other habitats are fragmented by increasing human incursion and changing land use, the amount of area where humans come in contact with wildlife and disease vectors increases due to \u2018edge effects\u2019. Habitat fragmentation has been associated with increased risk for Lyme disease in the northeastern USA.9 Decreasing levels of wildlife diversity, specifically the diversity of bird species, has been associated with increasing cases of West Nile virus infection among humans. Thus, loss of biodiversity may also be an important driver of emerging infectious diseases.8\n",

When returning travelers present with travel-acquired diseases, there are often delays associated with a proper diagnosis, treatment and reporting possible cases to public health authorities. Delays are especially likely to occur if physicians do not have sufficient experience with emerging infections or do not consider such diseases in their differential diagnosis. Delays in diagnosing such diseases in returning travelers can, in some cases, generate additional cases. For example, in 2003 the SARS outbreak spread quickly around the world from Hong Kong to Canada and then to other countries, and the spread of SARS was accelerated and facilitated by international air travel.31 More recently, international travel has facilitated the international spread of chikungunya. In two neighboring villages in Italy, over 200 autochthonously transmitted cases of chikungunya were identified and linked to a traveler who had acquired the virus while visiting relatives in India.32 The outbreak's occurrence demonstrates how easy it may be for this disease and others to spread to Europe and beyond. Indeed, autochthonously transmitted cases of chikungunya have since been reported in France33, 34 and in the Caribbean. The laboratory-based observation that some mosquitoes in Florida are susceptible to both infection by and dissemination of chikungunya virus raises the concern that the disease could spread once introduced in the Southern USA.35\n",

For example, homelessness has been associated with the spread of tuberculosis in several countries. The prevalence of tuberculosis, as well as hepatitis C and HIV, may be substantially higher in homeless populations.36 Tuberculosis has also been associated with poor neighborhoods, even in higher-income countries.37\n",

Unfortunately, foreign aid, by itself, is not always associated with a decrease in infectious disease activity or outbreaks for a variety of reasons. The association between poor nations and infectious disease outbreaks involves multiple factors, making interventions difficult. For example, government corruption may make foreign interventions, which are designed to reduce the spread of infections, less effective. Specifically, up to 5% of the differences among countries in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis could be related to corruption.39 With corruption, treatments do not necessarily go to those who need them most, or even to those with the ability to pay for them, but rather to those with specific connections. Such factors complicate strategies designed to reduce both poverty and the spread of infectious diseases associated with poverty. When countries attempt to restructure their spending in response to the loan conditions of the International Monetary Fund, the result can be a decrease in spending for public health, treatment, and surveillance.40 For example, the implementation of reform programs of the International Monetary Fund has been associated with increased tuberculosis incidence in post-communist Eastern European and former Soviet countries.40 While economic reforms may ultimately lead to higher standards of living and increased spending in public health, economic transitions may help fuel other factors associated with emerging infectious diseases. In fact, low- and middle-income countries, in the process of becoming more industrialized, may engage in more road construction, dam building, mining and other activities, which result in the alteration of land use and deforestation, and these changes can precipitate environmental changes, which lead to the emergence of infectious diseases.9, 17 Thus, it is possible that development efforts and aid may in some cases actually help increase the potential of infectious disease outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries.",

For example, during the 1970s, New York City decided to cut public health funding during a fiscal crisis.41 Unfortunately, in the following years, tuberculosis re-emerged as an important pathogen, and now a substantial burden of the disease is associated with drug resistance. The lack of public health support may have led to decreased diagnosis and treatment and even less efficient administration of treatment, and thereby facilitated the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.",

Misconceptions about the safety of the vaccines drive many of the decisions.54 Internationally, misperceptions regarding vaccine safety are an important public health problem.

Syphilis is straightforward to diagnose and treat. One reason for the re-emergence of syphilis relates to a behavioral change associated with an emergent technology: the Internet has been used to facilitate sexual encounters. Often these encounters are anonymous, and thus risky by nature.56 In addition, the specific websites designed to facilitate these encounters dramatically increase the potential number and diversity of partners any user can identify. While the Internet has made it easier to find sexual partners, it has complicated the process of contact-tracing for public health officials, a cornerstone of public health interventions for sexually transmitted infections. And while syphilis is not resistant to treatment, another sexually transmitted infection, gonorrhea, is now resistant to a number of antimicrobials,57and as treatment becomes more and more difficult, the infection may re-emerge and become even harder to control than in past decades, given the increasingly complicated sexual networks in several communities around the world.",

Although vaccination coverage is extremely high in most military populations, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases still occur. Adenovirus strains have caused severe pneumonia in military populations.58 From a historical perspective, the influenza pandemics of 1968 and especially 1918 were dramatic examples of infectious diseases that spread rapidly in military populations, and subsequently military-associated travel may have helped to distribute the disease to civilian populations. Intermittent meningitis outbreaks have been associated with college campuses. However, in recent years, college and university students have been associated with outbreaks of several re-emerging infections. For example, mumps outbreaks in several countries have been associated with college students.30 As long as people live in close proximity, with varying levels of immunity and frequent mixing, such settings will continue to be efficient population-based incubators for emerging infectious diseases around the world.",

In fact, SARS was greatly amplified in hospital settings, spreading both to other patients and to healthcare workers.59, 60 Over the past several decades, the hospital environment has created a new ecological niche for the emergence of several antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Examples include methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA)61 and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE).62 Although Clostridium difficile is not resistant to antimicrobials per se, it has certainly re-emerged over the past decade, in part due to the widespread use of antimicrobial therapy.63 Cases of C. difficile have also emerged among pediatric populations.64 While cases of MRSA first appeared in healthcare settings, they now occur in community settings,65 and so too have cases of C. difficile. These cases are occurring even in the absence of prior antimicrobial therapy, and without exposure to healthcare environments.63 Finally, one of the most alarming developments, with respect to antibiotic resistance, is the recent emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria around the world. Many of these have extremely limited treatment options. Gram-negative bacteria that produce the NMD-1 enzyme are a prime example.7 Although these are thought to have emerged from the Indian subcontinent, cases have occurred around the world, and may be introduced to new healthcare systems from returning travelers who are seeking medical attention. Once established in healthcare settings, these infections could potentially spread widely.",

These large cities are often composed of over 10 000 000 inhabitants. Megacities, with their poverty, poor sanitation, lack of infrastructure and high population densities, are perfect breeding grounds for infectious diseases, particularly sewage-related water-borne diseases and diseases that spread person-to-person.3 However, urban environments are also becoming increasingly suited for mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue.29 The populations at greatest risk for acquiring emerging infections are those that live on the edges of these megacities, in the peri-urban areas. People living in these areas are less likely to live in homes with concrete floors, have access to clean water, waste removal and medical services.66 For example, in regions where malaria is endemic, the urban prevalence of malaria is much lower in central parts of cities than in the surrounding peri-urban areas.67\n",

Many of these therapies lead directly to a diminution of the patient's immune response and thus increase the risk that a patient will develop a serious infection after their treatment. Thus, these medical advances have resulted in the emergence and re-emergence of new or previously uncommon pathogens. Cytotoxic therapies used to treat malignancies were not designed to specifically suppress the immune system by therapeutic intent. In practice, however, they do indeed cause prolonged periods of immunosuppression, and as a result many patients have developed a broad range of unusual infections, and many of the new pathogens are fungal.68 In the field of organ transplantation, both for solid organ transplantation and hematopoietic transplantation, previously rare fungal infections are now much more common among patients receiving transplants.69 Often, as a prophylaxis is used to protect against one type of infection, a pathogen resistant to the prophylaxis emerges. For example, infections due to zygomycosis have increased following the widespread use of voriconazole administration to treat Aspergillus.70\n",

Over the past several decades, both the atmosphere and the oceans have warmed (Figure 4-3\n).75 Temperature ultimately drives many other climate variables; however, the relationship between climate change and emerging infectious diseases is not a simple linear correspondence between rising temperatures and the increasing incidence of disease. Although changes in global temperatures may directly shift the distribution of populations of disease vectors, with regard to their latitudes and altitudes. For example, tick populations, an important driver of some emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, have readjusted to warming temperatures and are now present at higher latitudes in Sweden; some models predict that the same may happen in Canada and the USA.76, 77\n",

In addition to floods, droughts can also cause vector populations to increase, while also causing food shortages and weakening the resistance of the local population to disease, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In some cases, drought will reduce the natural predators of rodents, such as owls and hawks, which normally keep rodent populations in check. Even smaller-scale droughts can cause stagnant pools of water to develop in place of rivers and streams, and these water collections can serve as ideal breeding ponds for mosquitoes. Storing water in anticipation of drought con\u00additions can also provide breeding locations for mosquitoes. Drought-like conditions helped to drive the emergence of the West Nile virus in North America.84 After the introduction of the virus it spread quickly across the continent (Figure 4-4\n). Drought may have been a contributing factor to the explosion of cases of chikungunya in East Africa that subsequently spread to countries around the Indian Ocean.85, 86 This outbreak caused hundreds of thousands of cases around the world and has also generated other outbreaks thousands of miles away.",

While it took approximately 2 years to identify the virus that caused acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the virus responsible for SARS was identified in approximately 2 weeks. In addition, linking data from different laboratories over large geographic distances has dramatically changed the way potential food-related outbreaks are detected and traced. For example, PulseNet USA is a molecular surveillance network that has been of assistance in numerous food-borne outbreaks91 and similar networks exist or are under development in countries around the world. New molecular diagnostic platforms, coupled with increased surveillance efforts to detect new pathogens in both animals and humans, will continue to improve the ability to identify new pathogens more quickly.92 In addition, the promise of point-of-care testing may dramatically reduce the time it takes to rule in or rule out specific pathogens in the field, without sending specimens to reference laboratories.93\n",

Locally relevant cultural issues, such as burial practices contributed to intra-family and community spread. In addition, the disease was introduced to more urban environments where crowding and poverty further helped spread the disease.101 As travel-related cases outside of Africa show, human mobility is important in spreading infectious disease.
