The etiologies of invasive childhood bacterial infections have been significantly modified by widespread immunization against Hemophilus influenza type B (Hib), as well as pneumococcal serotypes. It is convenient to classify the most common bacterial infections based on age of the child. The organisms that should be considered in the septic neonate include Group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Staphylococci, particularly coagulase negative species, are becoming an important cause of sepsis in hospitalized neonates. Of note, herpes simplex virus can cause septic shock often indistinguishable from bacterial septic shock. It is not uncommon for neonates with severe herpes infections to have a concomitant bacteremia due to Gram-negative organisms, presumably caused by bacterial translocation from the intestines. In a recent large international severe sepsis therapy trial, Staphylococcus species were the most common cause of sepsis in children. In children under 1 year of age, community-acquired organisms such as Pneumococcus and Neisseria meningitides are frequent causes of sepsis. In the developing world, these two organisms, in addition to Salmonella species and Hemophilus influenza type B, are the most frequent causes of sepsis in infants. The most frequent pathogens remain the same in healthy school-aged children. In addition, sepsis without a clearly defined focus of infection such as meningococcemia becomes more common in this age group. Disseminated staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, often associated with a source in bone, joint, lung, or heart is a frequent cause of sepsis in children over 6 years of age. The incidence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus species has increased dramatically in developed countries.",

Severe sepsis induces a state of very high metabolic and oxygen demand. Inadequate DO2 evokes compensatory mechanisms in an attempt to restore the balance between oxygen demand and delivery. In the early stages of shock, abnormalities in oxygen transport balance are compensated via tachycardia and systemic vasoconstriction to improve organ perfusion and oxygen delivery. The ability of children to vasoconstrict causes systemic blood pressure to be preserved until later stages of shock when frank decompensation may occur. Children who have compensated shock frequently have normal or even elevated blood pressure, and as the shock state progresses, compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed leading to hypotension and organ dysfunction. Irreversible shock follows when cellular dysfunction is so severe that death occurs even if cardiovascular function is restored to an adequate level. In order to achieve the best possible outcomes, shock should be diagnosed early and treated aggressively, before decompensation occurs.",

Early recognition of shock requires a high index of suspicion, as only subtle changes in vital signs (i.e., mild tachycardia, mild tachypnea, or slight delayed capillary refill) may be the first signs of developing septic shock. In some forms of severe sepsis and septic shock, children present with \u201cwarm shock.\u201d Patients in warm shock have decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with relative hypovolemia from vasodilatation and venous pooling of blood. There is low diastolic blood pressure, and wide pulse pressure with resultant clinical findings of \u201cbounding pulses and warm extremities.\u201d Despite the potential reassurance of \u201cadequate pulses,\u201d the oxygen delivery in these patients is not adequate, thus they are in shock. Children (especially infants and neonates) will more commonly present with \u201ccold shock.\u201d These patients have elevated SVR, with a narrow pulse pressure, cool mottled extremities, and reduced peripheral pulses. There will often be tachypnea as a compensation for metabolic acidosis, which may develop into increased work of breathing if ARDS develops or there is underlying pulmonary disease. The child will frequently have fever and a \u201ctoxic\u201d or ill appearance. Of note, neonates and young infants may have septic shock without fever. As shock evolves, there will start to be clinical evidence of compromised organ function with worsening tachycardia, tachypnea, decreased urine output, and altered mental status. Decrease in systolic blood pressure is a late finding in septic shock, and represents decompensated stage of shock, which can rapidly be fatal. As the child progresses to irreversible shock, severe hypotension, lethargy, and respiratory failure are late and ominous findings.",

Hypotension in this situation should be treated by aggressive fluid resuscitation (see below). The decrease in CO may also be due to the vasodilating properties of the medicines used to intubate the child with \u2013 which neutralize the compensatory endogenous vasoconstriction that is occurring in the child with septic shock. Medicines such as benzodiazepines, propofol, barbiturates, and opiates should be used with extreme caution for this reason. Some have suggested ketamine as the premedication of choice to facilitate mechanical ventilation due to its ability to release endogenous catecholamines with resultant increase in SVR and relative preservation of cardiovascular stability.

Children in septic shock have relative (due to vasodilation and capillary leak) and/or absolute hypovolemia. Early restoration of effective circulating volume is associated with improved outcomes. A 20 mL/kg bolus of isotonic fluid such as 0.9% normal saline or Lactated Ringer\u2019s should be given as rapidly as possible (over 5 min) for initial resuscitation. Reassessment of the child\u2019s end-organ perfusion and vital signs should be performed after this and any repeat fluid bolus to determine if the child needs continued fluid resuscitation. The following are physiologic goals that should guide the fluid resuscitation: normalization of heart rate and blood pressure, improvement in capillary refill and perfusion to the extremities, normal mental status, and urine output > 1 mL/kg/h. Repeated 20 mL/kg isotonic fluid boluses should be given until these physiologic goals are met. Patients with severe septic shock will often require 60\u201380 mL/kg or more of isotonic fluid in the first hour of resuscitation. Ongoing capillary leak must be monitored and adequate volume should be administered to prevent further hypovolemia. Hypocalcemia and hypoglycemia should be evaluated for and corrected during the fluid resuscitation. A urinary catheter should be placed to accurately follow urine output continuously. Central venous access should be established in children who respond poorly to the first 3\u20134 boluses, and those with insufficient physiologic physiologic reserves at baseline. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring may be a helpful adjunct for monitoring. The development of hepatomegaly, gallop rhythm or new crackles on auscultation, in addition to a marked increase in CVP without concomitant improvement in hemodynamics are signs of possible fluid overload denoting that more fluid is unlikely to be beneficial. Children in septic shock frequently become progressively more edematous with ongoing resuscitation due to continuing capillary leak. The development of edema or anasarca should not deter continuing fluid administration, if it is indicated for restoration of hemodynamics and improvement in oxygen delivery. Serial physical examinations are crucial, and resuscitation should be modified based on the evolving clinical scenario.",

In children, a randomized controlled trial in children with dengue shock demonstrated earlier reversal of shock in patients who received 5% albumin, and a clinical practice paper on meninogococcal septic shock in children used 5% albumin for resuscitation with mortality lower (5%) than predicted. Crystalloids are less expensive and more readily available than albumin and should be used for initial resuscitation. Until there is more evidence on the safety and efficacy of albumin resuscitation in children with septic shock, it should be reserved for consideration in children that have already received over 60 mL/kg fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid.",

In children with femoral venous access, the trend in inferior vena cava saturations can be used to assess the adequacy of resuscitation. For children with normal blood pressure and cold shock, afterload reduction may be an important adjunct as these patients often have some level of myocardial dysfunction contributing to their shock; type III phosphodieterase inhibitors (Milrinone 0.5 mcg/kg/min) or vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin may be beneficial.",

The exact role of steroid replacement therapy, its safety, and the identification of pediatric septic patients that will benefit from steroid therapy is not well defined. At this point, there is no high-level evidence to support the use of steroids in children who are not at risk for adrenal insufficiency. The consensus of experts recommend patients with septic shock at risk for adrenal insufficiency (recent systemic steroid exposure, purpura fulminans, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or history of hypothalamic/pituitary insufficiency) or patients that have catecholamine resistant shock should receive hydrocortisone therapy after a random serum cortisol is drawn, if possible. There has not been consensus on the exact dose of shock or stress dose steroids. The dose range has been reported from 2 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day. The common practice at our institution is to send a random serum cortisol, followed by 100 mg/m2 dose of hydrocortisone IV and treatment with 100 mg/m2/day to be continued until the child\u2019s shock resolves if there is evidence of adrenal insufficiency (defined as dramatic hemodynamic improvement with steroid therapy or random cortisol less than 18 mg/\u03bcL). Steroids are stopped if there is no evidence of adrenal insufficiency or clinical improvement in the child\u2019s hemodynamics after the initial hydrocortisone bolus.",
