They arrived on federally chartered aircraft and passed through carefully arranged screening checks manned by CDC officials. Then, uniformed public health service personnel from other agencies within HHS and managed by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response office provided support. Security was present, including U.S. marshals. Everyone\u2014including those who had placed a large Nebraska welcome banner at the airport, deposited gift baskets in dormitory rooms, or wielded thermometers\u2014wanted these persons to arrive well, stay well, and feel welcome. These individuals were glad to be back in the United States. They did not want others to become infected with COVID-19 if, in fact, they proved to be ill. Nonetheless, they were constrained by schedule, location, and physical and human barriers until their departure from quarantine. On the verge of the departure of the evacuees from China, UNMC/NM received a mix of 11 isolated (infected) and two quarantined (not known to be infected) individuals evacuated by federal authorities from a cruise ship in Japan.",

In general, U.S. quarantine stations exist at major points of entry, such as at large international airports, where small numbers of sentinel cases of an emerging disease are thought to be most likely to be first encountered in the United States.3 In late 2019, UNMC/NM opened the first national quarantine unit. This twenty-bed unit is designed to host larger numbers of quarantined persons than existing, smaller quarantine stations. It is colocated with a national training resource for public health emergency personnel, in close proximity to the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit, to enable more advanced care if needed.4 This large group of 57 persons, however, were managed by federal authorities at Camp Ashland\u2014a Nebraska Army National Guard base outside of Omaha\u2014with some logistics support from UNMC/NM.",

However, a consensus regarding the advisability of testing could not be reached with authorities because of concerns regarding their personal autonomy (whether the quarantined persons understood the implications of testing and could make a choice freely) and uncertainty about what to do about isolated negative test results. Testing was not pursued. In the end, none of the quarantined evacuees from Wuhan demonstrated clinical evidence of COVID-19.6 The question of scope of presymptomatic shedding remained unanswered.",

Whether simply being observed in the setting of few or no symptoms, or more ill and in need of hospital level care, they were housed at UNMC/NM. By that time, Asia had accumulated many cases, and a literature base was developing.8,9 Nonetheless, cases in the United States remained few, and availability of information and specimens from affected areas in Asia that were relevant to medical countermeasure development was limited. This prompted UNMC/NM to launch its own research initiative for the prospective assessment of patients. It did so against a backdrop of initial hesitancy because of complex issues of patient autonomy under federal orders, interagency jurisdiction challenges as different governmental actors exercised their perceived obligations for oversight, and known larger patient populations in other countries that might make local research less important.",

Fielded questions were sometimes narrow and sometimes broad. They often highlighted uncertainty about the disease itself, which limited the ability to make evidence-based decisions. This process facilitated stakeholders coming together to start pursuing answers (Box 2).
