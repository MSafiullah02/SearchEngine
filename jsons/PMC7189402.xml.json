The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (WHO 2020c). The disease primarily spreads via close contact of respiratory droplets generated by infected individuals (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2020a). At the global level, sufficient testing capacity for COVID-19 is not available as it should be and therefore preventing individuals from accessing care. During the initial outbreak period, different countries have followed and implemented various testing strategies, depending on the availability of diagnostics and consumables. However, strict steps taken by the WHO has made the diagnostic available with the mission to \u201cdetect, protect and treat\u201d to break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (WHO 2020d). Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt treatment can substantially reduce the number of prospective cases. Hence, laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 holds the key in containing and restricting the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Immediate isolation of the suspected individual should be performed with proper guidelines, and they should be closely monitored for clinical symptoms and diagnosis should be performed in hospital-based laboratories as soon as possible. In addition, surveillance should be performed for those who were in contact with the suspected or conformed individuals by observing their clinical symptoms. Before taking decision about isolation, authorities should make sure that whether the suspected individual requires home isolation and careful clinical evaluation with safety assessment by healthcare professionals or not. If the suspected individuals present any symptoms during isolation, they should contact the doctors for their treatment. During home isolation, suggested medication and symptoms should be closely recorded. The suspected, probable and confirmed case definition of COVID-19 by the WHO has been presented in Fig. 9.1. The decision for diagnosis of an individual should be based on epidemiological and clinical factors which linked to an assessment of the probability of infection.\n",

The staff should be very well aware of the preventive measures and control guidelines for COVID-19, for that purpose WHO interim guidance should be followed. Collected specimens should be regarded as potentially infectious and therefore extreme precautions should be taken during the handling of the samples. The diagnosis of clinical specimens collected from the suspected individuals should be executed in appropriately equipped laboratories by the staff specifically trained in technical and biosafety measures. National guidelines on laboratory biosafety should be strictly followed, and all the procedures should be undertaken based on a risk assessment. Specimens for molecular diagnostics require BSL-2 or equivalent facilities, whereas any attempt to culture virus requires BSL-3 facilities at minimum. At least respiratory material should be collected for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from suspected individuals. Upper respiratory tract specimens nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or wash in ambulatory patients including lower respiratory specimens such as sputum (if generated) and/or bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal aspirate in patients with more severe respiratory disease (WHO 2020e). Other clinical samples may also be collected as SARS-CoV-2 has also been found in blood and stool, similar to SARS and MERS (Wu et al. 2020). In addition, paired sera should be collected during acute and convalescent phase for retrospective study using serological assays (when available). For post-mortem study, lung tissue may be collected for studying the pathophysiology of the disease. Specimen collection details proposed by the WHO have been presented in Table 9.1.\n",

In these testing times, these VRDLs are taking the lead in the real-time diagnosis of COVID-19 in India. Such robust networking of laboratories can be replicated in LMICs for prompt sample collection till the final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections. Also the development of a serological assay at the earliest will be beneficial for resource-limited countries, and also the turnaround time will be significantly reduced. Furthermore, as the pandemic widens its arm a point of care molecular test will be like a holy grail in the rapid diagnosis of cases, thereby initiating the treatment at the earliest.",
