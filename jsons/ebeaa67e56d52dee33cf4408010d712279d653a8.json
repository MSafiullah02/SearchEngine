Beta-thalassemia results of a default in the hemoglobin beta-chain synthesis. 1,5% global population are heterozygotes for this disease. In this study, by a multiple linear regression, we have analyzed the evolution of COVID-19 infection in three Italian regions (Puglia, Sardinia, Sicilia) with different beta-thalassemic prevalences, in order to search a link. The results have showed that betathalassemic heterozygote population prevalence is correlated to immunity against COVID-19, by a regression.

Furthermore, it revealed that Favipiravir could inhibit the envelope protein and ORF7a protein bind to porphyrin, thus preventing the virus from entering host cells, and catching free porphyrins.
