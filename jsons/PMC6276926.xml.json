The hypothesis that hand disinfection would prevent transmission of RV was based on a series of previous studies that suggested that direct contact was the predominant mechanism of spread of RV [5]. Studies in the experimental setting suggest that effective prevention of RV infection requires complete eradication of the virus from the hands [11, 12]. Both routine hand washing and ethanol containing hand sanitizers are effective for removal of RV from the hands but have no persistent activity against subsequent hand contamination [7]. A hand treatment that has persistent antiviral activity for some time after application would be expected to be more effective than simply removing the virus present on the hands.",

In the experimental setting, RV is generally applied to the hands in liquid medium [7, 8]. In the natural setting, virus that contaminates the hands is presumably contained in small particles of nasal secretions. It is possible that the presence of the nasal secretions protects the virus from the action of the hand treatment. This possibility could be investigated in the experimental setting, but detection of such an effect would suggest that a low pH hand treatment for prevention of natural RV infection will not be possible.",
