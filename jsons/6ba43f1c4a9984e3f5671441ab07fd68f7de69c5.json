In this paper, we formulate a stochastic LotkaVolterra food chain chemostat model that includes L\u00e9vy jumps and interval parameters. Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution. Moreover, the threshold between extinction and persistence in the mean of the microorganism is obtained. Finally, some simulations are carried out to demonstrate our theoretical results.",
