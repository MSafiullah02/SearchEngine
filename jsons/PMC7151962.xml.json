Cytoplasmic volume is usually high relative to the nucleus (Figs. 2-1\nand 2-2\n). Hyperplasia is a nonneoplastic enlargement of tissue that can occur in response to hormonal disturbances or tissue injury. Hyperplastic tissue has a tendency to enlarge symmetrically in comparison to neoplasia. Cytologically, hyperplastic cells have a higher nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio than normal cells. Examples of hyperplastic responses include nodular proliferations within the parenchyma of the prostate (Fig. 2-3\n), liver, and pancreas (Fig. 2-4\n).",
