            "text": "Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are global public concerns. With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention. Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results. For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.",

[13] [14] [15] [16] Since SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with SARS-CoV, 17, 18 it is reasonable to speculate that these organ dysfunctions may also be found in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Actually, a retrospective, observational study showed that in 52 critically ill adult patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 15 (29%) had acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) cardiac injury, and 15 (29%) liver dysfunction. 19 The most severe sequelae after rehabilitation from SARS were femoral head necrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. High-dose steroid pulse treatment was used to suppress inflammation, which caused subchondral osteonecrosis in about 5% of SARS patients. 20 The risk of osteonecrosis was 0.6% for patients receiving less than 3 g and 13% for patients receiving more than 3 g prednisolone-equivalent dose. 20 In addition, the use of high dose of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone for an extended duration was shown to be a significant risk factor for osteonecrosis. 21 ",

In SARS, higher neutralizing antibody response was associated with a longer illness. 13 In most MERS patients, the levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies were weekly and inversely correlated with LRT viral loads. 51 In addition, an early MERS-CoV antibody response was associated with reduced disease severity. 98 Thus, testing antibody is helpful for surveillance, prediction of disease outcome and epidemiological investigation, but not for early diagnosis. week 30, while only anti-S3 showed significant neutralizing activity. 101 Anti-N appeared earlier than anti-S, indicating that S proteinbased assays may be preferable for use with convalescent sera. 102, 103 Sera tend to react against both antigens with higher sensitivity. 102 Cross reaction also happened in assays using recombinant antigens.",

Since late December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause that started in Wuhan, Hubei, China has been attracting tremendous attention. The pathogen of this unexplained pneumonia was isolated from human airway epithelial cells and identified as a novel CoV, named SARS-CoV-2. 2,3 The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern on 5 February 2020 and more recently, a pandemic. By 18 March 2020, WHO confirmed a total of 191 127 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 7807 deaths worldwide. Among them, 91 845 confirmed cases were distributed in Western Pacific region and 74 760 were in",

Chinese National Health Commission recommended that both ORF1ab and N should be tested positive for a positive result. If only one region is positive, the result needs to be re-tested.73 The US CDC recommended that all the N region targets should be detectable for a positive result, or be undetectable for a negative result. If only one target is positive, the result is inconclusive and need to be retested.74 So, it is important that all the two or three regions tested should be positive to identify a positive case.RT-PCR relies on sophisticated equipment that it may not be present in resource-limited regions. These limitations gave birth to alternative isothermal amplification methods, such as transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and rolling-circle amplification (RCA). 75-80 These alternative isothermal amplification methods are simple, rapid, specific and sensitive which only need a heating block or water bath capable of maintaining a constant temperature. 81,82 Chantratita, et al developed a real timeNASBA assay that could detect as little as one copy/reaction of SARS-CoV RNA.83 Compared to RT-PCR, a RT-LAMP assay of SARS-CoV showed 100-fold-greater sensitivity, with a detection limit of 0.01 PFU.84 In another study, detection rate of the RT-LAMP assay was lower than the RT-PCR assay for samples isolated from patients within the first 3 days of disease onset, and was similar to RT-PCR when detecting specimens sampled from patients with more than T A B L E 4 In-house assays for detecting SARS--LAMP methods have also been developed for MERS-CoV detection with a high sensitivity.[88][89][90][91][92][93] Further alternative isothermal amplification methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 genome need to be established, and would show potential applicability for point of care testing (POCT) in resource-limited areas.",

However, this method has not yet been validated with real patient samples, so it should not be used for clinical purposes now. Although many RT-PCR assays for the SARS-CoV-2 have been developed, NAT positive cases only account for about 50% of clinically confirmed cases. To raise the positive rate of NAT, standard collection, strict storage and transportation conditions, proper extraction and amplification procedures are needed. To increase test sensitivity, increasing the template volume and total reagent volume for a single run would be very useful. To improve test specificity, amplifying a second genome region for confirmation is suggested. Most importantly, appropriate controls should be established to ensure the results are reliable. For SARS-CoV, which are also suitable for other viruses, WHO recommended one negative control and one positive control for extraction, one water control and one positive control for a PCR run, and the patient sample spiked with a weak positive control to detect PCR inhibitory substances (inhibition control). 97 Except for these external controls, internal controls, including plasmid DNA, virus-like particles (VLPs), RNase P gene, and housekeeping genes of airway epithelial cells such as beta-actin have been used for NAT of respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Of all these kinds of internal controls, only RNase P presents in all types of SARS-CoV-2 infected samples and can control the quality of all procedures, from sample collection to amplification",

Of these methods, ELISA and CLIA are suitable for first line screening because of the large throughput, short processing time, and simple operating procedure, while neutralization assay is used as the gold standard for confirmation in many laboratories. The basic issue in serological assays is the source of antigen. Once virus has been isolated from patients, cell lysate or supernatant of virus infected cells could be used for serological assays. These methods are most convenient and rapid, as they only need susceptible cell cultures and virus. However, they need to be performed in BSL-3, and proper inactivation of the virus without reducing immunogenicity of antigens is required, thus limiting the widespread use of virusbased serological testing. Furthermore, cross reaction is likely to happen because of the conserved sequence and structure between CoVs. By cloning immunogenic viral genes into prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression plasmids, transfecting the plasmids into bacterial or mammalian cells and purifying proteins, recombinant antigens can be developed to overcome the disadvantages of virus infected cells. 99 Recombinant antigens are safe and do not require BSL-3 containment. Importantly, although taking longer time and more steps for development, recombinant antigen based assays enable the selection of immunogenic and virus specific antigens to maximize both specificity and sensitivity, and more suitable for standardization. 100 In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, N and S protein are the major immunogenic proteins and the first choice for producing recombinant antigens. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N, and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent-phase SARS patients.

Laboratory testing plays the major role in early detection of infected persons, enabling recognition of the infection source and cutting off the transmission route. The results of laboratory testing are affected by various factors. To improve NAT capacity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we summarized the literature and guidelines and suggested that: (a) If LRT specimens are unavailable, collect stool and blood samples at later period of illness to improve the positive rate of NAT. (b) Increase template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection. (c) Put samples in reagents containing guanidine salt such as TRI-ZOL, TRIZOL LS, or AVL buffer to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA.

Raw data were not published in References 110 and 33, so the CT values and viral loads are estimated from figures. The finding of undetectable in swabs in between CT values of 26.89 and 32.61 might be caused by the poor quality of specimen collected in D16, which was not discussed in the original article. Time indicated in Reference 33 is the time after hospitalization. Abbreviations: NP swab, nasopharyngeal swab; OP swab, oropharyngeal swab; ud, undetected.Specific primers and standard operating procedures for nucleic acid tests (NAT) could be established as soon as the complete genome of the virus was sequenced, making NAT the optimal method for diagnosis. Current NAT tests for RNA viruses mainly include RT-PCR, alter-Due to its simplicity, easy methodology and extensively validated standard operating procedure, RT-PCR is now the preferred and most widely used method for NAT. RT-PCR assays targeting ORF 1a, ORF 1b, S gene, N gene of SARS-CoV can detect <10 genome equivalents.58,59 Assays targeting M gene and 3 0 UTR also showed high sensitivity.60,61 Three rRT-PCR assays for routine detection of MERS-CoV have been developed and recommended by WHO.62  The primers tar-",

WHO declared that positive antibody test results indicated a previous infection with SARS-CoV. Seroconversion from negative to positive or a 4-fold rise in antibody titer from acute to convalescent serum indicated recent infection. No detection of antibody after 21 days from onset of illness seemed to indicate that no infection with SARS-CoV took place. 107 For MERS-CoV, the US CDC recommended ELISA as a screening test and microneutralization as a confirmatory test for MERS-CoV antibodies. 108 Where a patient has evidence of seroconversion in at least one screening assay and confirmation by a neutralization assay in samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, this patient can be considered a confirmed case. A 4-fold increase in MERS-CoV antibody titer by neutralization tests in acute and convalescent serum samples performed in parallel is needed for confirmation. 62 For conducting serology of SARS-CoV-2, or broad CoV serology on paired samples (in the acute and convalescent phase), WHO recommended that the first serum sample should be collected in week 1 of illness and the second collected 3 to 4 weekslater, collecting at least 3 weeks after onset of symptoms if only a single serum sample can be collected.34",

On Day 5, an increase of viral antibodies can be seen in nearly all patients. IgM positive rate increased from 50% to 81%, whereas IgG positive rate increase from 81% to 100%.23 This is in contrast to a relatively low detection positive rate from molecular test. Based on this result, serological testing might improve the detection positive rate. However, the clinical records of patients involved in this study were not available. Although the target patients were those who received around 10 days of medical treatments upon admission, it is not sure on which days of illness the high positive rate of IgG and IgM occurred.
