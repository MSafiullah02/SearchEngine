For example, it is easy to conceive that, if a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is introduced into a household, the household members of that case are more likely to become infected than people who are not in direct contact with that case. In statistics, this phenomenon is called clustering or nonindependence of outcomes and requires the use of specific methods. This would not be true for diseases such as cancer or heart disease in which there is no transmission of an infectious agent. Thus, transmission dynamics models are designed to describe and explain how transmission occurs between contacts.",

In nontransmissible disease epidemiology, the number of susceptibles in a population is often fairly constant because the outcome is rare (eg, some cancers and heart disease). In addition, the incidence rate is independent from the number of people affected by the disease in the population. With infectious diseases, the number of individuals infected at any point in time influences the chance that a susceptible individual will contact an infected person. Therefore, the incidence rate of infection is not constant through time and can vary from day to day.",

The basic reproductive number is the average number of secondary cases of an infection that will occur once an infectious individual is introduced into a population that is completely susceptible to infection.7 There are multiple mathematical definitions for R\n0, depending on the context and model; some definitions use algebraic principles and some use calculus.8 One straightforward, algebraic formula is as follows7:R0=numberofcontactsperunittime\u00d7transmissionprobabilitypercontact\u00d7durationofinfectiousness=c\u00d7p\u00d7d\n",

Thus, to understand the number of subsequent infections from the second generation of infective individuals, another, yet highly related term is needed, called the effective reproductive number (R). Similar to R\n0, R is influenced by the number of contacts per unit time, the transmission probability per contact and duration of infectiousness; however, as the number of susceptibles in the population decreases, so will the number of individuals who can be infected by each case.

The simplest approach is to begin with a closed population of size N, where there are no births or deaths affecting the size of the population (including deaths from infection). These models are helpful in counting the flow of individuals through the compartments over the course of time of an epidemic. That is, at time t, the rate at which susceptibles move from S to I is equal to c\u00d7p\u00d7(I/N), and the rate at which people move from I to R is equal to 1/d, where d represents the average duration of infectiousness.

In general, for microparasites (ie, bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and prions), the outcome is the number of infected hosts, whereas for macroparasites (ie, helminths and ectoparasites), the outcome is the number of viable female offspring produced. This is important because the intensity of infection (ie, number of parasites infecting the host) impacts the infectiousness of the host. Some additional differences between macroparasites and microparasites are the following: the generation time for macroparasites is longer than for microparasites; hosts rarely develop full immunity to reinfection with macroparasites; and the death rates of macroparasites have greater variability than those observed in microparasites. These factors can be accommodated using increasingly complex compartmental models.10 Even though a large number of macroparasites are considered as reemerging, the majority of emerging infectious diseases in the United States are microparasites (Table 1\n); thus, most of the examples will be those of microparasites.",

In deterministic models, the size of each compartment is influenced by fixed rates of emigration (going out) and immigration (coming in), which can result in fractions of people being assigned to a given compartment. In contrast, stochastic models incorporate the role of chance in determining whether an event occurs (eg, that transmission occurs given an exposure) and, thus, either an event occurs or it does not. Fractions of people are not allowed to enter compartments, and thus stochastic models attempt to better model reality in transmission of infectious disease scenarios. However, because stochastic models are usually run through thousands of iterations to identify the average probability of observing the modeled event, the results from deterministic and stochastic models are often similar when applied to large populations.7 However, by running a stochastic model through many iterations, a distribution of outcomes is obtained, which is more informative than the average result obtained from a deterministic model.4., 11. Stochastic models have at least 2 advantages over deterministic models. First, they are better at modeling the probability of an epidemic running a course through extinction.7 Second, they do not require the assumption of a large sample size (which may be unrealistic in some settings) that deterministic models need.6\n",

In addition, there are complex patterns that dictate how people within populations interact with each other. For example, while typical school-aged children spend the majority of their time mixing with other children of their same age, the parent of that child likely mixes with a much broader age range of individuals in the same community because of activities related to work, hobbies, etc. Despite the obvious complex pattern of mixing among individuals, basic transmission dynamics models assume that individuals within a population mix homogeneously.7 That is, the probability of a given individual coming into sufficient contact to transmit infection is equal in every other individual in that population, regardless of age, gender or social status.",

A major advance in transmission dynamics models has been the development of methods to account for heterogeneous mixing patterns.

Zoonoses not only account for approximately 75% of all emerging infections14 but also have been responsible for some of the most devastating pandemics in world history [ie, plague, Spanish influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS].15 Most of the zoonotic pathogens that have been modeled are viruses (with influenza and SARS accounting for almost half of all zoonotic models).15 Modeling infection transmission accounting for spread from the animal reservoir is often an important step in understanding the relevant dynamics. However, the impact of including animal reservoirs in the model is as varied as each zoonotic infection. For example, while HIV can be considered a zoonotic infection in the strictest sense of the word, ongoing spread from the animal reservoir plays an insignificant (if any) role in the overall spread of HIV, which is principally spread person to person. In contrast, tick-borne infections, such as Lyme disease, are not known to be transmitted person to person, and therefore modeling infection transmission from the reservoir is critical. In between these 2 ends of the transmission spectrum are infections such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, which is primarily spread by escaping the animal host (by contaminated food products) but can also be spread person to person via the fecal-oral route.",

Models have shown the dynamic nature of these RNA pathogens as they expertly coevolve with their hosts.16 Our ability to account for microbial adaption and change in transmission models has advanced given the increased availability of viral genome sequences and the growth in computing power.17 Reasons for modeling microbial adaption include estimating probabilities of emergence from the reservoir, resistance to antimicrobials, geographic diversity across different populations and rate of global spread.17\n",

As these advancements have been made, so have the sophistication and complexity of the models advanced to account for these factors.
