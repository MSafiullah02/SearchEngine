Since then, thousands of cases have been reported worldwide. As of 11 March 2020, more than 118,000 cases of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) have been documented in 114 countries, with more than 4200 deaths, of which approximately 95% of cases and 97% of deaths have occurred in China. Community transmission is now believed to exist in mainland China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy (Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont regions). In Spain, more than 2000 cases have been confirmed so far, some of them with no epidemiological criteria.",

The mortality rate was higher in patients with comorbidities: cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%), high blood pressure (6%), oncological disease (5.6%). A quarter (26%) of patients requiring hospitalisation were admitted to the ICU, of which 47% required mechanical ventilation and 11% required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The mortality rate was far higher among critically ill patients. 2,3 Confirmed cases included 1716 healthcare workers, of which 14.8% were in serious or critical condition, and 5 died.",

Some patients can develop severe respiratory failure, which will usually appear around the eighth day after the onset of symptoms. High flow nasal oxygen or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, being aerosol-generating procedures, should be reserved for very specific patients who must be closely monitored; intubation should never be delayed unnecessarily. Patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation should receive lung protection ventilation in accordance with current clinical guidelines. Patients with severe ARDS may need to be ventilated in the prone position, with neuromuscular blockade during the first 24 h and elevated PEEP. If ventilatory difficulties persist despite these measures, the use of ECMO is recommended, since this can improve survival, according to the scant information available. 13, 14 Patient-ventilator disconnection should be minimised by using closed-loop systems, and active humidification must be avoided by using heat and moisture exchangers. 3. Management of septic shock. Generally speaking, the recommendations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign are applicable to the management of septic shock in patients with SARS-CoV-2. 4. Antimicrobial treatment. Administration of antimicrobials should be avoided unless there is suspicion of associated sepsis or bacterial superinfection. In this case, empirical antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia should be started early in accordance with clinical guidelines and the patient's specific characteristics.",

Treatment with specific antiviral agents. There is no conclusive evidence that antivirals are effective in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Results are still pending from several ongoing clinical trials: ---Neuraminidase inhibitors: there are no data available on their effectiveness in the treatment of SARS CoV-2, so routine use is not recommended unless there is a risk of concomitant infection with influenza viruses. ---Nucleoside analogues: remdesivir is believed to have potential as a treatment for SARS CoV-2. In clinical trials in animals infected with MERS-CoV, both viraemia and lung damage were significantly reduced compared to controls A randomised controlled clinical trial is currently underway to evaluate its efficacy and safety in these patients. ---Protease inhibitors: inhaled interferon-\u2423 (broad antiviral spectrum) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (in vitro activity against SARS CoV-2) are currently being administered as antiviral therapy, but there is still no evidence that these are clinically effective. ---Monoclonal antibodies: these could be useful in SARS CoV-2 infection based on their good results in patients with Ebola (REGN-EB3, MAb114 ).",
