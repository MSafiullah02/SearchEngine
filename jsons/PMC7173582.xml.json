Disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens. Infection is the process in which the microorganism multiplies or grows in or on the host. Infection does not necessarily result in disease since it is possible for the organism to grow in or on the host without producing an illness (see Chapter 29). In the case of enteric infections (i.e., diarrhea) caused by Salmonella, only half of the individuals infected develop clinical signs of illness. A frank pathogen is a microorganism capable of producing disease in either normal healthy or immunocompromised persons. Opportunistic pathogens are usually capable of causing infections only in immunocompromised individuals (burn patients, patients taking antibiotics, those with impaired immune systems, elderly patients with diabetes, etc.). Opportunistic pathogens are common in the environment and may be present in the human gut or skin, but normally do not cause disease.",

The time between infection and the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms such as diarrhea, fever or rash, is the incubation time (Table 22.1\n). This may range from as short as 6\u201312 h in the case of Norwalk virus diarrhea to 30\u201360 days for hepatitis A virus, which causes liver disease. At any time during infection, the pathogen may be released into the environment by the host through feces, urine, or respiratory secretions. Although the maximum release may occur at the height of the disease, it may also precede the first signs of clinical illness. In the case of hepatitis A virus, the maximum excretion in the feces occurs before the onset of signs of clinical illness. The concentration of organisms released into the environment varies with the type of organism and the route of transmission (Table 22.2\n). The concentration of enteric viruses during gastroenteritis may be as high as 1010\u20131012 per gram of feces.",

Many human pathogens can be transmitted only by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal. Examples include the herpesvirus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea), and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). This is because their survival time outside the host is very brief. Pathogens transmitted through the environment may survive from hours to years outside the host, depending on the organism and the environment. Pathogens may exit a host in respiratory secretions from the nose and mouth or be shed on dead skin or in feces, urine, saliva, or tears. Thus they may contaminate the air, water, food, or inanimate objects (fomites). When contaminated air is inhaled or food consumed, the organisms are effectively transmitted to another host, where the infection process begins again. Airborne transmission can occur via release from the host in droplets (i.e., coughing) or through natural (surf at a beach) or human activities (cooling towers, showers) (see Chapter 5). Some organisms may be carried great distances, hundreds of meters or miles (e.g., Legionnaires\u2019 disease and foot-and-mouth disease). Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect. Infection of a host may be by direct inhalation of infectious droplets or through contact with fomites on which the airborne droplets have settled. Hand or mouth contact with the organism on the surface of a fomite results in the transfer of the organism to the portal of entry, that is, nose, mouth, or eye.",

During the Civil War (1860\u20131865), encamped soldiers often disposed of their waste upriver but drew drinking water from downriver. This practice resulted in widespread dysentery. In fact, dysentery, together with its sister disease typhoid fever (Salmonella typhi), was the leading cause of death among soldiers of all armies until the twentieth century. It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that this state of affairs began to change. At that time, the germ theory was generally accepted, and steps were taken to treat wastes properly and protect drinking water and food supplies.",

Because of these new practices, the national typhoid death rate in the United States between 1900 and 1928 dropped from 36 to 5 cases per 100,000 people. The lower death toll was largely the result of a reduced number of outbreaks of waterborne diseases. In Cincinnati, for instance, the yearly typhoid rate of 379 per 100,000 people in the years 1905\u20131907 decreased to 60 per 100,000 people between 1908 and 1910, following the inception of sedimentation and filtration treatment of drinking water.

At least 40 species of Legionella have been shown to cause disease, but the most prominent pathogenic species is L. pneumophila, which first received extensive attention after an outbreak in 1976 in Philadelphia. The disease is found worldwide, with most sporadic cases occurring during the summer and fall months. The reservoir is primarily aquatic. Hot water systems, air-conditioning cooling towers, and evaporative condensers have all been implicated in outbreaks, as have decorative fountain and retail store misters (Fig. 22.5\n). The organism has also been found in creeks and ponds and the soil from their banks. The bacterium survives for months in tap and distilled water. The primary route of transmission is thought to be through the inhalation of aerosols. Exposure is not uncommon, as reflected in serologic assays that show that 1\u201320% of the general population have antibodies to L. pneumophila.\n",

Once ingested, it passes through the stomach and into the upper intestine. The increase in acidity via passage through the stomach stimulates the cyst to excyst, which releases two trophozoites into the upper intestine. The trophozoites attach to the epithelial cells of the small intestine. It is believed that the trophozoites use their sucking disks to adhere to epithelial cells. The adherence to the cells flattens the villi, causing malabsorption and diarrhea by not allowing adsorption of water and nutrients across the intestine. It can cause both acute and chronic diarrhea within one to four weeks of ingestion of cysts resulting in foul-smelling, loose, and greasy stools. Once the trophozoites detach from the epithelial cells and travel down the intestine, cholesterol starvation is believed to stimulate the trophozoites to encyst and pass back into the environment as a cyst. Giaridiasis can be treated with metronidazole (Flagyl). Although in some cases the symptoms will spontaneously disappear without treatment, in most cases without treatment, the symptoms will wax and wane for many months. In symptomatic patients, more trophozoites than cysts are excreted into the feces, which cannot withstand the harshness outside the human body. In asymptomatic humans, mostly cysts are passed in stools; therefore Giardia carriers can serve as a source of cysts in the environment.",

In one study 40 to 45% of beavers in Colorado were found to be infected with Giardia and shedding up to 1 \u00d7 108 cysts/animal/day, making them a major source of Giardia in the environment (Hibler and Hancock, 1990). Other animals that may contribute to Giardia in the environment are muskrats, where 95% of the population is infected. Various other animals found to be infected are cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and dogs (Erlandsen, 1995). To date, no infections with G. lamblia in humans have been directly linked to an animal host, but there is evidence which suggests that animal-source Giardia could potentially infect humans. Studies based on isoenzyme analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) banding patterns did not find a difference between cysts from beaver hosts and human hosts (Isaac-Renton et al., 1993).",

It was not identified as a human pathogen until 1976, when it was described in the stools of immunocompromised hosts. Since that time, there have been numerous waterborne outbreaks, the most notable being the Milwaukee outbreak in April 1993, which infected over 400,000 people (MacKenzie et al., 1994) and killed more than 50 (Case Study 22.1\n).Case Study 22.1Cryptosporidiosis in MilwaukeeEarly in the spring of 1993, heavy rains flooded the rich agricultural plains of Wisconsin. These rains produced an abnormal runoff into a river that drains into Lake Michigan, from which the city of Milwaukee obtains its drinking water. The city's water treatment plant seemed able to handle the extra load: it had never failed before, and all existing water quality standards for drinking water were properly met. Nevertheless, by April 1, thousands of Milwaukee residents came down with acute watery diarrhea, often accompanied by abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In a short period of time, more than 400,000 people developed gastroenteritis, and more than 100\u2014mostly elderly and infirm individuals\u2014ultimately died, despite the best efforts of modern medical care. Finally, after much testing, it was discovered that Cryptosporidium oocysts were present in the finished drinking water after treatment. These findings pointed to the water supply as the likely source of infection; and on the evening of April 7, the city put out an urgent advisory for residents to boil their water. This measure effectively ended the outbreak. All told, direct costs and loss of life are believed to have exceeded $150 million.The Milwaukee episode was the largest waterborne outbreak of disease ever documented in the United States. But what happened? How could such a massive outbreak occur in a modern U.S. city in the 1990s? And how could so many people die? Apparently, high concentrations of suspended matter and oocysts in the raw water resulted in failure of the water treatment process\u2014a failure in which Cryptosporidium oocysts passed right through the filtration system in one of the city's water treatment plants, thereby affecting a large segment of the population. And among this general population were some whose systems could not withstand the resulting illness. In immunocompetent people, Cryptosporidiosis is a self-limiting illness; it is very uncomfortable, but it goes away of its own accord. However, in the immunocompromised, Cryptosporidiosis can be unrelenting and fatal.",

In the small intestine, the oocyst excysts, releasing four sporozoites, which attach to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. The sporozoite becomes enveloped by the microvilli, which fuse and elongate to cover the sporozoite. The sporozoite then matures into a trophozoite and into a schizont. The schizont, an asexual reproductive form in which multiple mitosis occurs followed by cytokinesis, results in eight first-generation merozoites. The cell ruptures, releasing the merozoites, which then infect neighboring epithelial cells, and schizogony occurs again, but forming only four second-generation merozoites. When the cell ruptures, the merozoites attach to uninfected epithelial cells and form either macrogametocytes or microgametocytes. The macrogametocytes and microgametocytes further divide and form macrogametes and microgametes, respectively. They join, forming a zygote, which differentiates to form the unsporulated oocyst, which is then expelled from the cell surface, sporulates, and is shed in the host's feces.",

The world prevalence exceeds 500 million infections with more than 100,000 deaths each year. There are two sizes of cysts, small (5\u20139 \u03bcm) and large (10\u201320 \u03bcm), with each cyst producing eight trophozoites in the host. Only the larger cyst has been associated with disease; the smaller cyst tends to be associated with a commensal lifestyle (the organism benefits from the host, while the host is unaffected). About 2\u20138% of people infected develop invasive amebic dysentery in which the trophozoites actively invade the intestinal wall, bloodstream, and liver. It is unknown why this occurs. This organism is generally a problem in developing countries where sanitation is substandard and is transmitted via contaminated food and water. Humans are the main reservoir, although pigs, monkeys, and dogs have also been found to serve as reservoirs. No waterborne outbreaks have occurred in the United States for more than 30 years.

Infections are usually associated with children swimming in natural springs or warm waters although they are rare in the United States. The flagellate swims into the nose of a host and sheds its flagella (or it may be forced into the nose via diving). The amoeba then follows the nerves to the brain, producing a toxin that liquefies the brain. The organisms do not form cysts in the host. Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) develops, causing severe, massive headaches. Death usually follows four to six days later. Diagnosis is most frequently postmortem on brain examination.

E. intestinalis spores have been identified in sewage, surface, and groundwaters, supporting the notion of environmental transmission. The spores are highly resistant to heat inactivation and drying. Waller (1979) found that E. cuniculi survived 98 days at 4\u00b0C and six days at 22\u00b0C.",

E. bieneusi causes diarrhea and wasting disease. It is the most important cause of microsporidiosis in AIDS patients. Several surveys have determined that 7 to 30% of AIDS patients who have unexplained chronic diarrhea are infected with E. bieneusi (Weber et al., 1994). E. intestinalis is similar to E. bieneusi in that it infects the intestines and causes diarrhea, but it can also infect kidneys and bronchial and nasal cells. It can infect macrophages, which allows it to disseminate throughout the body. It is secreted in feces and urine, which supports the notion of water transmission. E. cuniculi is not an intestinal parasite but, it can be shed in urine (Zeman and Baskin, 1985), and therefore environmental transmission is a possibility. It has also been described infecting many different mammals, which means that there could be many animal reservoirs that can contaminate the environment. E. hellem has been recognized and shown to cause eye infections (keratoconjunctivitis) and disseminated infections such as ureteritis and pneumonia. It does not invade the intestine, but it can be shed in the urine (Schwartz et al., 1994).",

            "text": "\nToxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, is an intestinal coccidium of felines with a very wide range of intermediate hosts. T. gondii causes a wide range of clinical conditions including brain damage in children, lymphadenopathy, ocular disease, and encephalitis. In the immunocompetent adult it causes symptoms that could be mistaken for influenza. It is estimated that 13% of the world's population is infected with T. gondii (Hughes, 1985). Acquisition of the organism can be through contact with infected undercooked meat containing a bradyzoite (tissue cyst) and through contact with the environmental stage, the oocysts. The oocyst is excreted only in cat feces (domestic and wild) (Fig. 22.15\n). Congenital infection occurs when a pregnant woman becomes infected for the first time. Once infected, tachyzoites can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. Of the fetuses that become infected, 15% have severe complications. The oocysts can persist in soil and water, which can serve as a route of transmission. One study in England found that 100% of wild cats had antibodies to T. gondii (McOrist et al., 1991). Various studies of cats in the United States have found a seropositive prevalence of approximately 40% (Dubey and Beattie, 1988). The high prevalence of T. gondii in the cat population demonstrates that they can be a significant source of oocysts in the environment. The oocyst can survive 18 months in the soil (\u221220 to 33\u00b0C) in Kansas (Frenkel et al., 1975) and over 410 days in water (Yilmaz and Hopkins, 1972). Its hardiness in the environment also suggests the possibility of environmental transmission.",

There are no known animal reservoirs. The eggs are swallowed and the larvae hatch in the small intestine (Fig. 22.17). The larvae develop into second-stage larvae, which penetrate the lumen and enter into the bloodstream and capillaries. They travel via pulmonary circulation to the liver and heart, where the larvae develop into third-stage organisms that can lodge in the alveolar space (Fig. 22.18\n). This migration through the lungs can cause pneumonitis (Loeffler's syndrome). The immature worms leave the lungs and travel through the bronchi, trachea, and epiglottis. They are then swallowed and arrive in the small intestine. There they undergo two molts, mate, and produce eggs. There is medical treatment against the adult intestinal worm: mebendazole or pyrantel pamoate. Symptoms usually correspond to the worm load, and a heavy worm load can lead to intestinal blockage. The adult worm can reach more than 30 cm in size. Although most infections are mild, more than 20,000 people die annually with complications caused by intestinal blockage (Freedman, 1992).",

            "text": "\nTaenia saginata is transmitted by infected beef products and is the most common tapeworm found in humans. It is present in every country where beef is consumed (Fig. 22.21\n). Cattle become infected from eating grass or soil contaminated with human waste containing gravid proglottids. This occurs in areas where night soil (human waste) is used as fertilizer. The proglottids can survive in the environment for weeks. One study found that they could survive 71 days in liquid manure, 16 days in untreated sewage, and up to 159 days on grass (Jepsen and Roth, 1952). The eggs hatch in the duodenum, and hexacanths (tapeworm embryos containing six pairs of hooklets) are released. The hexacanths penetrate the mucosa, enter the intestine, and travel throughout the body. They then enter muscle and form a cysticercus (larval tapeworm enclosed in a cyst), which becomes infective in a few months. Humans become infected when they eat undercooked beef containing such cysticerci. The cysticerci can be inactivated at 56\u00b0C or by freezing at \u22125\u00b0C for 1 week (Schmidt and Roberts, 1989). Within 2\u201312 weeks the worm begins shedding gravid proglottids. The average worm length is 10\u201315 feet. Symptoms of infection are abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, intestinal blockage, and loss of appetite (contrary to the belief that tapeworms infections cause an increase in appetite). The infection can be diagnosed by examining a gravid proglottid or scolex. The best methods for prevention are sanitation (proper disposal of human wastes) and thorough cooking of beef.",

In addition, each parasitic stage involves different organs and thus different medical symptoms. The cercariae from infected snails are found in freshwater bodies. Once the cercariae penetrate the skin, they transform into the schistosomula, the first parasitic stage. This causes the disease cercarial dermatitis, which is immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to the penetration. After 1\u20132 days of living in the subcutaneous tissues, the schistosomula migrate through the lungs to the liver. The organisms mature through this migration, developing into male or female adult worms. The adult worms then migrate to the circulatory system and to other organs. Each pair of adult worms live an average of 3\u201310 years and potentially up to 30 years (Lucey and Maguire, 1993). They also produce 300 eggs a day, only a percentage of which reach the lumen to be passed in the feces. Many of the eggs become trapped in the small blood vessels and tissues, causing granulomas and intestinal, visceral, liver, and fibroobstructive diseases. The acute form of disease, Katayama fever, can occur in previously uninfected persons 2\u20136 weeks after exposure to cercariae-contaminated water.

Fecal\u2013oral transmission may predominate in areas with poor sanitary conditions, whereas respiratory transmission may occur more often with better sanitation. In temperate climates, enteroviruses are more common during the summer season. In the United States, most enterovirus isolations (82%) occur from June to October. However, vaccine strains of poliovirus are isolated year-round because of routine vaccination of children. In contrast, in tropical and semitropical areas, enteroviruses do not show seasonality. Transmission of enteroviruses within a household is usually started by young children; then the infection spreads quickly to other family members, especially in larger families living under crowded conditions with poor hygiene. Ironically, paralytic poliomyelitis and perhaps some nonpolio enteroviral diseases are more often observed in developing countries, where sanitary conditions are improving. With poor hygiene, most individuals are infected at a very early age, when infection rarely results in overt disease and maternal immunity limits infection. This early exposure to the virus elicits a protective immune response on reexposure to these viruses later in life. In contrast, when early exposure is prevented or delayed as a result of better sanitation, an initial poliovirus infection is likely to occur at an older age, when maternal immunity has waned and the possibility of developing a more severe clinical condition is greater.",

HEV has a diameter of 32\u201334 nm and an ssRNA genome. Serologically related smaller (27\u201330 nm) particles are often found in feces of patients with hepatitis E and are presumed to represent degraded viral particles. It has been suggested that the higher prevalence of HEV in adults may be due to a silent infection early in life, with subsequent waning of immunity after 10 to 20 years, when they again become susceptible to infection by HEV (Bradley, 1992). Important epidemiological features of HEV infection are the frequent occurrence of outbreaks associated with consumption of sewage-polluted water (Case Study 22.2\n) and its severity, particularly among pregnant women, in whom the case-fatality rate may be as high as 25% (Balayan, 1993). HEV virus also infects swine and other animals and has been transmitted by the consumption of undercooked meat (Tamada et al., 2004). To date, no outbreak has occurred in the United States.Case Study 22.2A Massive Waterborne Outbreak of Infectious HepatitisApproximately 35,000 young adults in New Delhi, India came down with hepatitis in the fall of 1955. There were 73 deaths recorded among those affected, one of the largest viral waterborne outbreaks ever documented. New Delhi obtains its drinking water from the Jamuna River. Because of flooding following the monsoon season, water drawn from the river for treatment and distribution became heavily contaminated with sewage from a nearby creek. From November 11 to November 16, raw wastewater freely entered the drinking water treatment plant. The staff at the plant, aware of the contamination, increased the dose of alum coagulant and chlorine in an effort to eliminate contaminating pathogens. About three weeks later, the first hepatitis cases were identified. The observed incubation period ranged from 22 to 60 days, with an average of 40 days. Surprisingly, no increase in other types of viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections was observed during the hepatitis epidemic, possibly because of the partial success of emergency disinfection using high levels of chlorine.In an attempt to isolate the epidemic's causative agent, researchers at the Virus Research Center in Poona inoculated eight different cell lines with a variety of clinical specimens obtained from hepatitis patients. Unfortunately, no viruses were isolated from any of the samples tested. Although the etiologic agent was not identified, it was believed that the epidemic was caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). A retrospective study conducted in 1980 showed that the outbreak in New Delhi was not caused by HAV or hepatitis B virus (HBV) but by the so-called enterically transmitted non-A, non-B (ENANB) hepatitis virus. This agent was later renamed hepatitis E virus (HEV). Although waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E have occurred in many regions of the world, outbreaks have almost exclusively been in developing countries. HEV waterborne outbreaks primarily affect young adults, and fatalities among pregnant women are not uncommon.The raw sewage contamination of drinking water that led to the large HEV outbreak in New Delhi was thought to be controlled by the use of high doses of alum coagulant and chlorine. Although this measure prevented an outbreak of bacterial, parasitic, and other enteric viral diseases, it failed to eliminate HEV. Therefore, prevention of contamination, rather than extensive treatment, offers the best alternative for safe drinking water.",

Among these, viruses such as adenoviruses and rotaviruses are larger and well defined; thus, they are relatively easy to identify by EM. However, many smaller (20\u201340 nm) viruses without a distinctive morphology are often present in fecal samples of patients suffering from gastroenteritis (Fig. 22.24\n). Norwalk virus was the first to be described (Kapikian et al., 1972). Subsequently, other small round viruses were observed in diarrheal stools, namely, Montgomery County, Hawaii, Wollan, Ditchling, the Parramata, the Cockle agents, and minirotavirus. Norwalk-like viruses have emerged as a major cause of food- and waterborne disease. Several epidemiological studies have shown that Norwalk viruses are the major cause of foodborne illness, causing as much as 67% of the foodborne illness in the United States (Gerba and Kayed, 2003). However, the identity of the Norwalk virus was not defined until Jiang et al. (1990) sequenced the Norwalk virus genome, allowing its classification in the family Caliciviridae. Subsequently, Norovirus was approved as the official genus name for the Norwalk-like viruses. These viruses nonenveloped the virus with a diameter of approximately 26 to 35 nm and a positive-sense ssRNA genome. The human Caliciviridae have been divided into two genera: Norovirus and Sapporovirus.",

Two important characteristics differentiate these two types of viruses: stability at low pH values and temperature. Whereas the rhinoviruses are inactivated at pH below 6, the enteroviruses are stable at low pH values. In contrast, rhinoviruses are stable at temperatures (50\u00b0C) that would inactivate most enteroviruses (Couch, 1996). Human rhinoviruses have an icosahedral morphology, containing a single-stranded RNA genome. The diameter of these viruses is approximately 25 to 30 nm. Although no etiologic agent is identified in half of the acute upper respiratory illnesses, it has been estimated that 30 to 50% are caused by rhinoviruses. In fact, rhinovirus infection is probably the most common type of human acute infection (Gwaltney, 1997). The optimal temperature for rhinovirus growth is 33 to 35\u00b0C, which corresponds to the normal temperature of the nasal mucosa. This may explain why these viruses propagate most efficiently in the upper respiratory tract. These viruses can be propagated in monkey and human cell lines. There are 100 different human rhinovirus serotypes. Although these viruses are species specific, an equine rhinovirus can infect other species, including humans. Experimentally, chimpanzees and gibbons have been infected with human rhinoviruses, but these animals do not develop disease. Volunteer studies have shown that infection can be started with less than one tissue culture median infectious dose (TCID50).",

It is believed that contamination of objects in the environment may play a significant role in the transmission of rhinoviruses. This and the ability of rhinoviruses to survive on human skin and on inanimate objects may explain the more prevalent self-inoculation form of transmission. Both finger-to-eye and finger-to-nose contact are part of normal human behavior. Therefore, experimental rhinovirus transmission has been effectively interrupted by hand disinfection. Rhinoviruses are relatively stable on inanimate surfaces. They can survive at least 3 h on human skin, nonporous materials such as plastic surfaces, Formica, stainless steel, and hard synthetic fabrics such as nylon and Dacron. In porous materials such as paper tissue and cotton fabric, rhinoviruses can survive for 1 h (Hendley et al., 1973).",

Approximately 90,000 hospital admissions and 4500 deaths are associated each year with RSV in the United States in both infants and young children. In approximately half of infants younger than eight months, the infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, resulting in life-threatening bronchitis, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, and croup (Ginsberg, 1990). Furthermore, RSV is the most common cause of nosocomial infections in pediatric wards and the most important cause of middle ear infection in children. Approximately 1% of all infants suffer from a severe RSV infection that may require hospitalization, and about 1% of those die. Asymptomatic first infection with RSV is rare; almost 100% of infected children develop disease. Because of poor protective immunity, reinfection is very common, but the disease is not as severe. Inoculation of adult volunteers with RSV has shown that the nose and eye mucosae are the most important portals of entry of this virus. Efficient transmission of RSV by large droplets or by touching occurs when susceptible individuals are in close contact with children shedding the virus but not when they are exposed to small-particle aerosol (McIntosh, 1997).",

The airborne route does not appear to be the major route of spread as close contact appears necessary for effective spread under most conditions. It is present in both the respiratory droplets and feces. It appears capable of surviving for a few days in liquids and for 24 h on fomites (Rabenau et al., 2005).",

How long a pathogen survives in a particular environment depends on a number of complex factors, which are listed in Table 22.13\n. Of all the factors, temperature is probably the most important. Temperature is a well-defined factor with a consistently predictable effect on enteric pathogen survival in the environment. Usually, the lower the temperature, the longer the survival time. But freezing temperatures generally result in the death of enteric bacteria and protozoan parasites. Viruses, however, can remain infectious for months or years at freezing temperatures. Moisture\u2014or lack thereof\u2014can cause decreased survival, and UV light from the sun is a major factor in the inactivation of indicator bacteria in surface waters; thus, die-off in marine waters can be predicted by amount of exposure to daylight. Viruses are much more resistant to inactivation by UV light.",
