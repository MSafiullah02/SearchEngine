The patient had not yet disclosed any relevant information to a doctor. During a physical examination, a 3-mm-diameter wound with little pus that was covered with a band aid was seen under the xiphoid of the patient. There was no tenderness, rebound tenderness, or high muscular tension in the upper abdomen, and no foreign body was palpable. On the fourth night, the CT was repeated and showed a columnar high-density shadow localized in the upper abdominal cavity (Fig. 1C) . Subsequently, the medical staff performed exploratory laparotomy under strict protective measures after a negative-pressure operating room was prepared. During the operation, a 3-mm irregular skin-penetrating wound was found under the xiphoid, and the omentum was damaged approximately 1 cm away from the greater curvature of the stomach. There was a 4-cm \u00d7 3-cm haematoma in the omentum. A 9-cm thermometer was found in the omental sac. The mercury tip of the thermometer had disappeared (Fig. 1D) . No pus or food residue was found in the abdominal cavity. After the operation, tetanus antitoxin was injected, and piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium were intravenously infused as antibacterial therapy (3.375 g q8h).",

Therefore, he had a strong sense of guilt and was worried about being discriminated against by society. After effective psychotherapy, the patient's depression improved, and he was willing to cooperate with the examination and treatment. We used the Impact of Events Scale -Revised (IES-R) to evaluate the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of the patient at that time. The three subscale scores were as follows: intrusion subscale, 14 points; avoidance subscale, 12 points; and hyperarousal subscale, 9 points. The total score of the IES-R scale was 35, which is significantly higher than the diagnostic standard of 20 (Hawryluck et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2005) . After the evaluation, a senior psychologist was arranged to provide him with regular psychological counselling, and we also increased the nursing management. Considering that the psychological pressure of the patient had been relieved, we did not give him antidepressants.",

Previous studies have reported that 10 %-42 % of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients were afflicted by anxiety, depression and other mental symptoms (Han et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018) , which are closely related to the quarantine state in addition to the diseases themselves. The adverse effects of mental illness on the recovery of COVID-19 patients should be considered, including the possibility of death in a few patients (Goyal et al., 2020) . Therefore, psychotherapy should be considered as an important treatment measure for patients suffering from infectious diseases that are characterized by severe social harm. It is especially important to provide timely and effective psychological counselling for patients who believe they may be responsible for disease transmission.",
