[1] [2] [3] Patients with the illness, called coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid- 19) , frequently present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath within 2 to 14 days after exposure. 4 As of March 23, 2020, there had been 332,930 confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported globally, and 14,510 deaths had been reported. 5 In recognition of the widespread global transmission of Covid-19, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 6 The first case of Covid-19 in the United States was diagnosed on January 20, 2020, in Snohomish County, Washington, in a person who had recently traveled to Wuhan, China. 7 On February 28, Public Health-Seattle and King County (PHSKC) was notified of a positive Covid-19 test result from a patient who had been admitted to a local hospital and tested on the basis of newly revised testing criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 8 The patient resided in Facility A, a skilled nursing facility with approximately 130 facility residents and 170 staff. When the initial case was confirmed on February 28, 2020, PHSKC and the CDC immediately began case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of persons with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. Some of the information obtained through the investigation was rapidly reported through a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 9 C a se R eport On February 27, 2020, PHSKC was notified of a 73-year-old woman with cough, fever, and shortness of breath who resided in Facility A, in which a cluster of unexplained febrile respiratory illness was occurring. The index patient had symptom onset on February 19 and worsening respiratory status requiring supplemental oxygen for 5 days before she was transferred to a local hospital on February 24, 2020. At the hospital, she was found to be febrile (temperature as high as 39.6\u00b0C), with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, 83% while she was breathing ambient air). She became more hypoxemic over the next 24 hours, despite bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and was intubated on February 25, 2020, because of respiratory failure. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Her medical history included insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. She had no known travel or contact with persons known to have Covid-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 231, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 232, "end": 235, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 236, "end": 239, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 307, "end": 310, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 411, "end": 412, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 542, "end": 543, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 694, "end": 695, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 867, "end": 868, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1154, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1686, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Multiplex viral respiratory panel and bacterial cultures (sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage) were unrevealing.

Two of the facilities with definitive epidemiologic links had staff working both at that facility and at Facility A; the third facility had received two patient transfers from Facility A. Information received from surveys of long-term care facilities and on-site visits identified factors that were likely to have contributed to the vulnerability of these facilities, including staff who had worked while symptomatic; staff who worked in more than one facility; inadequate familiarity with and adherence to PPE recommendations; challenges to implementing proper infection control practices, including inadequate supplies of PPE and other items (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer); delayed recognition of cases because of a low index of suspicion; limited availability of testing; and difficulty identifying persons with Covid-19 on the basis of signs and symptoms alone. Examples of specific PPE challenges included an initial lack of available eye protection, frequent changes in PPE types because supply chains were disrupted and PPE was being obtained through various donations or suppliers, and a need for a designated staff member to observe PPE use to ensure that staff were consistent with safe PPE handling (e.g., not touching or adjusting face protection, primarily face masks, during extended use).

In total, 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been identified among residents, personnel, and visitors as of March 18, and 30 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in King County had identified at least one confirmed case of Covid-19. Staff working in multiple facilities while ill and transfers of patients from one facility to another potentially introduced Covid-19 into some of these facilities.

Publicly available information on staffing and quality measures shows no indication that baseline practices at Facility A placed residents at greater risk than residents at other similar facilities. This investigation had a number of limitations. Not all residents and staff were interviewed and tested for SARS-CoV-2, which might have led to under-ascertainment of infections, particularly for those who were presymptomatic or asymptomatic. For example, at another facility (Facility B) that had a subsequent Covid-19 outbreak epidemiologically linked to Facility A, swabbing of all residents revealed that infections with low cycle threshold values (indicating a large quantity of viral RNA) occurred among some residents who did not have symptoms. 19 There was not a complete roster of visitors to Facility A, and it is possible that some infections among visitors were also missed by these surveillance and investigation efforts. Because symptom onset dates were not available in many cases, the epidemic curve is presented by date of report; however, this does not adequately represent the timing of disease onset in the facility, given that the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis in this cohort was 8 days but had considerable variability.
