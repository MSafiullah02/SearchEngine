In fact, amantadine and its 3,5-dimethyl analogue memantine are NMDA receptor antagonists and are approved for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, respectively.3 Thus, the design of new amantadine-related anti-influenza agents without CNS side-effects is a highly desirable goal. Amantadine, rimantadine, memantine, and related polycyclic amines also possess trypanocidal activity (Fig. 1\n).4\n",

After a major upsurge of the disease in the late 1990s throughout many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, annual infections have now fallen to 70,000 as a result of major surveillance and treatment programmes.15 However, over 60 million people remain at risk, and in some areas death rates exceed those from HIV/AIDS and malaria. The drugs currently available to treat HAT require administration under medical supervision and are characterized by limited efficacy, toxicity, and resistance. For example, the arsenical drug melarsoprol, which is used to treat late stage disease, can result in a reactive encephalopathy which kills up to 10% of patients. In the absence of treatment, HAT is invariably fatal and new drugs are therefore urgently required. Recently, it was reported that the anti-influenza virus drug rimantadine was active in vitro against bloodstream form T. brucei, and that other aminoadamantane derivatives had enhanced activity.4, 16 To extend these observations, we have tested several new bisnoradamantanes and related compounds for activity against bloodstream form T. brucei.",
