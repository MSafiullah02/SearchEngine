In this study, we tested a new assay for IBV strain classification that is less expensive and requires reduced time and effort to perform.

By the end of 2009, variant II and variant II-like strains appeared in Jordan (unpublished data) and North Iraq, and, in 2011, the unique IBV Q1 strain was reported in Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia[14].
