            "text": "The middle-to-late Holocene (ca. 8000-3500 cal. yr B.P.) was a period of significant cultural dynamics as well as environmental and climatic changes in the highlands of the south-central Andes. This region, known locally as the altiplano or puna, with its salt flats, dried lakes, paleosols, glacial deposits, and archaeological sites, provides a number of crucial archives from which to tease out this complex interrelationship. Paleoenvironmental studies performed on several puna wetland areas have stimulated debate on climatic variability during this period. Some suggest that middle Holocene environmental conditions were dry, changing to more humid conditions-similar to those of modern times-toward the late Holocene (e.g., Veit, 1996; Grosjean et al., 1997 Grosjean et al., , 2003 Grosjean et al., , 2007 Valero-Garc\u00e9s et al., 2000; Abbott et al., 2003; Tapia et al., 2003; Morales, 2011; Tchilinguirian & Morales, 2013) . Contrariwise, others have noted a predominance of humid environmental conditions during the middle Holocene before a drier spell during the late Holocene (e.g., Betancourt et al., 2000; Latorre et al., 2002) . These disparities may relate to local geography (e.g., latitude, longitude and altitude), resolution scales, sensitivity of the analyzed proxy, chronological problems (e.g., 14 C reservoir effect; see Geyh et al., 1999) , differential preservation, and, finally, environmental heterogeneity and its complexity in relation to climate (Garreaud & Aceituno, 2001; Grosjean et al., 2003) . Consequently, the chronology, intensity, and duration of these environmental shifts in different parts of the Andean highlands of northern Chile, northern Argentina, southern Peru, and southern Bolivia highlight a more complex paleoenvironmental picture, and therefore the need to generate regional and local environmental models (Grosjean, 2001; Yacobaccio & Morales, 2005; Nu\u00f1ez, Cartajena, & Grosjean, 2013; Tchilinguirian & Morales, 2013) .",

            "text": "Middle-to-late Holocene climate change influenced human settlement, adaptation, and culture change in the south-central Andes. Archaeological research on middle Holocene sites associated with puna wetlands indicates a series of highly complex social responses to existing environmental conditions. For instance, in the Salar de Atacama, the extreme aridity postulated for this area during the middle-to-late Holocene transition would have provoked a decline and/or hiatus in human occupation, a period traditionally referred to as the \"archaeological silence\" (N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Cartajena, & Grosjean, 2013) . However, patches/enclaves with more stable hydrological resources persisted during this time in places, such as the Puripica Gorge (Chile) or in Susques (Argentina). These areas served as ecological refugia exploited by hunter-gatherers, providing localized higher floral and faunal concentrations within the broader desert environment (Yacobaccio & Morales, 2005; N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Cartajena, & Grosjean, 2013) . In time, the intensive management of some of these enclaves engendered significant cultural change associated with increased social complexity, in effect laying the basis for the transition from huntergatherer to agropastoral societies in the late Holocene (Grosjean et al., 1997; Nu\u00f1ez, Grosjean, & Cartajena, 2010) . Thus, a thorough understanding concerning the development of these varied socioeconomic changes during the middle Holocene and transition to the late Holocene requires a detailed study of the cultural processes involved and the environmental history that underlies specific areas. Taking an interdisciplinary perspective, here we focus on a combination of paleoenvironmental and archaeological data to elucidate the impact of local environmental changes on hunter-gatherer procurement strategies and their transition to foodproducing societies in Antofagasta de la Sierra (southern argentine puna), during ca. 7000-3000 cal. yr B.P.",

Our reconstruction of streamflow history for these two rivers is based on cross-correlations between geomorphological, sedimentological, and diatomological proxy data. We focus on these two rivers given that there has been intense archaeological research in this area. This past research shows that archaeological sites dating to the period addressed here are mainly associated with the paleowetlands of these two rivers. Additionally, other archaeological data, such as rock art (Aschero, 2010) and lithic assemblages (Hocsman, 2014) , reveal cultural differences between the human occupations along these two rivers. We believe that a comparative analysis combining paleohydrology and archaeological evidence from these two river basins is relevant to our understanding the role of extreme, for example, arid and high altitude, environments in the process of sociocultural change.",

The Miriguaca and Las Pitas river basins lack evidence of glacial action. However, the upper reaches of the basins contain certain periglacial features such as debris flow and solifluction lobes that cover the side slopes. Also, the flood plains of both rivers above 4800 m asl contain wetlands with soil mounds resulting from soil frost and riparian flora. Along the middle reaches of the two basins (4800-4000 m asl), the rivers have downcut into the ignimbrite plateau forming canyons 80-120 m deep with sheer vertical sides susceptible to rockslides. Finally, along the lower reaches (4000-3200 m asl), both rivers end in broad valleys inset 20-30 m into Pleistocene conglomerates that form a veneer over pediments. Five Late Pleistocene to Holocene fluvial terraces are evident along both rivers, along with an active flood plain occupied by wetlands (vegas).",

Orographic precipitation infiltrates into fractured volcanic rocks located above 4500 m asl and supports baseflow. The high elevation watershed for the Las Pitas River covers an area of ca. 100 km 2 and contains a greater number of springs compared to the Miriguaca River, whose high elevation watershed is restricted to ca. 60 km 2 (Figure 1 ). Variations in upland seasonal flooding is minimal, and water tables lie less than 0.5 m from the surface, allowing for the development of organic soils and riparian vegetation (cushion peat land) (Squeo et al, 2006) . Streamflow slightly increases during the winter due to lower atmospheric temperatures and reduced evapotranspiration rates (Salminci, Tchilinguirian, & Lane, 2014) . Seasonal streamflow variability increases in the lower basin, probably as a consequence of water loss due to infiltration and higher evapotranspiration rates compared to the higher basin. Furthermore, irrigation activities are another factor reducing streamflow in the lower basin (Tchilinguirian, 2009) .",

(Martinez, 2014) . During the period between 8000-4000 cal. yr B.P., we have evidence in the Southern Andes highlands for sporadic occupation of huntergatherer sites. In some areas, such as northern Chile and Argentina, the evidence suggests that certain areas that had been occupied during the early Holocene were abandoned (N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 1999) . However, the archaeology from Antofagasta de la Sierra shows greater habitation stability during this period (Mondini et al., 2013) . In fact, between ca. 8500 and 6000 cal. yr B.P. there is evidence of considerable residential activity in areas above 3600 m asl that had high potential resource productivity (Mondini et al., 2013) . These hunter-gatherer groups undertook mobility strategies that entailed regular visits to certain sites where they engaged in the intensive exploitation of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and vicu\u00f1a (Vicugna vicugna), thereby maximizing use of wild resources (Aschero and Martinez, 2001) .",

This transition is characterized by a progressive reduction in residential mobility framed within increasing sedentism (Hocsman, 2002 (Hocsman, , 2006 Aschero & Hocsman, 2011) . Crucially, important socioeconomic changes occur during this period such as the domestication of camelids as evidenced by osteometric changes (Aschero, Izeta, & Hocsman, 2014; Grant Lett-Brown, 2014; Urquiza & Aschero, 2014) , and the use of a large variety of domesticated plants such as Chenopodium sp. aff. quinoa, Oxalis tuberosa, Solanum tuberosum, and Zea mays (Babot, 2011) . Aschero and Hoscman (2011) proposed that the commencement of productive strategies was not due to the influence of \"nuclear areas,\" but rather to local factors within hunter-gatherer groups themselves. Their proposal for this new social dynamic is based on systematic research of 11 archaeological sites, supported by 26 radiocarbon dates, mostly from rock shelters. Of these sites, 10 are located in the Gorge of Las Pitas River (Quebrada Seca 3; Cueva Salamanca 1; Punta de la Pe\u00f1a 11A, 3A and 4; Pe\u00f1as Chicas 1.1, 1.3 and 1.5; Puntas Chicas 6; Pe\u00f1as de las Trampas 1.1); the remaining is located on the Miriguaca River (Alero sin cabeza; Figure 1 ). This transitional process culminates ca. 2500 cal. yr B.P. when sedentism becomes reinforced through the founding of small permanent villages, such as the Casa Chavez Mont\u00edculos site, inhabited by specialized agropastoralist groups (Olivera & Vigliani, 2000 /2002 Grant Lett-Brown, 2014) . Since ca. 1000 cal. yr B.P., the study area has witnessed increased sociopolitical complexity associated with large-scale agricultural production, significant population concentration in the central basin (La Alumbrera site), and an increased centralization and bureaucratization of power (Olivera & Vigliani, 2000 /2002 Salminci, Tchilinguirian, & Lane, 2014) .

We focused on two ca. 0.9 km long reaches, one along each river, that contain exposures of middle-to-late Holocene deposits. Other outcrops along both rivers are dominated by bedrock or Pleistocene and historical unconsolidated deposits. Detailed analysis and sampling were performed on 300 and 100-m long middle-to-late Holocene outcrops along the Las Pitas and Miriguaca Rivers, respectively. The Las Pitas River profile (RLP) is located in an ignimbrite canyon, 9.5 km upstream from the river's mouth; the Miriguaca River profile (RM) is located below an incised piedmont, 1.8 km upstream from the river's mouth (Figure 1 ). At both profiles, we describe the geometry of sediment bodies and identify lithofacies and lithofacies associations (FA). Distinctive lithofacies types were defined in terms of relative scales of strata thickness and internal bedding, yielding information on depositional features and formation processes at a relatively small-scale (Bridge, 1993) . Lithofacies were classified on the basis of grain size, sedimentary structures, biological components, and geometry, following the procedures described by Friend (1983) and Miall (1982 Miall ( , 1996 . Lateral and vertical changes as well as the distinctive spatial relations of the lithofacies (three-dimensional geometry) are the basis for FA definitions, thereby yielding more information about larger-scale aspects of the depositional environments.",

These were subsequently analyzed using a Polivar Reichardt Jung binocular microscope with Nomarsky Interference Contrast and 100\u00d7 immersion plan-apochromatic objectives. Relative abundance was calculated counting between 300 and 500 valves, and the density of the total valves g \u22121 of dry sediment was estimated by the aliquot method (Battarbee, 1986) . We follow Bradbury's (1988) proposal that diatom assemblage samples with less than 100,000 valves g \u22121 of dry sediment should not be considered reliable for paleoenvironmental inferences. Taxonomical identification was based on monographs by Rumrich, Lange-Bertalot, and Rumrich (2000), and other related articles. Servant and Servant-Vilary (2003) indicated that the relationships between diatoms and habitat type provide a good indicator of changes in water depths for a number of rivers in the Bolivian puna. According to these authors, habitats are divided into two large groups. Group 1 is represented by facultative planktonic, benthic, and epiphytic species and indicates shallow aquatic habitats and high water tables associated with mesic conditions. Group 2, on the other hand, is mainly characterized by aerophilous species, and indicate the expansion of hydromorphic soils and humid meadows, that is, low water tables and less humid conditions. Information concerning ecological references are based on standard texts such as Lowe (1974) ; Van Dam, Mertenes, and Sinkeldam (1994) , among others.",

Functionality categories are numbered: (1) \"residential base camp\" (seasonal occupation site comprising sleep camps as well as a wide range of domestic activities); (2) \"specific activities\" (temporary occupation site used by a group or single, where they developed particular activities, such as hunting); (3) \"activities associated to ritual events\", such as human burials or intentional offerings; (4) no data available regarding functionality. It should be remembered that these categories are not mutually exclusive, as some sites were multifunctional. Closer to the modern river channels are unpaired Terraces VI, VII, and VIII. Terraces VII and VIII are located 2 and 1 m above the channel, respectively, and composed of sands and gravel that post-date 1400 cal. yr B.P. The lower reaches of both rivers form valleys inset 20-30 m into the Pleistocene piedmont that is conformable with Pleistocene Terrace III farther upslope. The inset flood plains are occupied by marshes (Figures 3 and 4) . Modern fluvial processes vary within and between the basins. In the higher (cryoandean belt) zone of both rivers (>4950 m asl), channels are indistinct and plant cover diminishes considerably with altitude. Between 4950-4000 m asl, streamflow is conducted in slightly meandering, 2 m wide and 1 m deep, channels that transport mediumsized gravels to coarse sands. Channels occupy 5-10% of the active flood plain or fluvial belt, while the remaining surface is covered by typical, intrazonal alto-Andean cushion peatland. These plants comprise compact, primarily circular cushions formed by closely packed shoots with short internodes, sometimes occupied by shallow pools. Associated with the peatland are organic and mineral soils affected by paludization, iron-reduction, and freeze-thaw processes.",

Likewise, the stream valleys have similar stream gradients and lithologies and lack visible evidence of neotectonics or dams caused by tributary Holocene debris flows. The main difference between these two river basins lie in the size of their high altitude catchment areas: the Las Pitas River has a high altitude catchment, that is, 20% larger and has more springs providing for greater baseflow (Figure 1 ). There are also local differences between the Las Pitas River and Miriguaca stratigraphic localities. Although both localities are downstream from major tributaries within their hydrological basins, the Las Pitas River locality is situated within a bedrock canyon with a more confined flood plain compared to the Miriguaca River locality, the latter located on the piedmont (Figures 3 and 4) .

This facies is interpreted as high-energy braided channels devoid of paleomarshes. These gravels occur in tabular layers laterally extending > 200 m. These are overlain by layers of massive, matrix-supported gravels separated by an erosive discontinuity and are interpreted as debris flow deposits (FA2).

As opposed to the previous phase, PII is represented by laminated deposits with abundant diatoms and organic matter that alternate with bar and swale stratified gravels. These gravels are thicker and more laterally extensive than in the previous PI. Common red iron mottles in alluvial sands and gravels indicate a shallow phreatic table favoring localized pools (2-10 m 2 ) with greater organic and diatom sedimentation. Diatoms assemblages indicate areas marginal to the channel that are susceptible to frequent inundation (B2P). Toward ca. 4800 cal. yr B.P., deposits suggest greater surface stability, possibly vegetated (B3P), and later dominated by tychoplanktonic species, indicating rising water table levels and more humidity (B4P) until ca. 3800 cal. yr B.P. Diatom composition coincides with facies interpreted as high-energy channels across the flood plain, but with areas of high biological productivity (FA4 and FA3).

The quantity, energy, and seasonality of runoff depend on the dimensions, altitude, soils, vegetation, and geology of the catchment areas as well as local geomorphic controls (Schumm, 1991) . The geology, vegetation, climate, and soils of the two adjacent hydrological basins are similar, differing primarily in the greater catchment area, elevation, and number of springs in the Las Pitas watershed. The lower reaches of the Las Pitas and Miraguaca rivers both contain shallow alluvial fill over bedrock. However, the Las Pitas River is more entrenched and confined (Figure 4d ). The two rivers' hydrological response to climate change may differ due to a combination of local geomorphological controls and contrasting size and morphometry of their watersheds. The higher altitude Las Pitas catchment area, exceeding 4500 m asl along its eastern perimeter, experiences greater orographic rainfall. Thus, the effects of increased moisture during the local humid events of PI were likely greater for the Las Pitas River than for the Miriguaca River. Upland precipitation supplies the high mountain aquifers that discharge into lower elevation springs and subsequently into wetlands, favoring elevated water tables. The confined nature of the Las Pitas flood plain reduces the effect of evapotranspiration facilitating a more stable baseflow. Consequently, the development of more stable wetlands (cushion peats) mitigated the overall aridity of the region. For the Miriguaca River, however, and its lower elevation upper basin, the hydrological input was smaller resulting in shallower and/or more unstable water tables. Also, the open and wide flood plain of the lower Miriguaca River permits a more spatially dynamic and exposed alluvial reach, facilitating greater evaporation losses compared to the confined canyon of Las Pitas. Consequently, the lower Miriguaca River contained poorly developed wetlands during PI, marked by ephemeral streamflow.",

Veit (1996) argues that wet periods during the middle Holocene, while recharging local aquifers, were not sufficient to generate the geoecological conditions needed to produce extensive and long-lasting marshes. In effect, these wet cycles had restricted local consequences. Thus, increasing aridity during the late Holocene gave rise to diminished baseflow and greater seasonal discharge variability for the Miriguaca River. In contrast, short episodes of increased moisture during the middle Holocene generated a greater hydrological response for the Las Pitas River: more sustained baseflow, reduced discharge variability, and enhanced peat formation.",

These sites are defined as hunter-gatherer residential bases located near wetlands and within rock shelters with favorable protection/hiding conditions within the Las Pitas ignimbrite canyon. However, no sites date to the period between ca. 6700 and 6300 cal. yr B.P.

Be-tween ca. 6100 and 5400 cal. yr B.P., settlements in the higher parts of the Las Pitas watershed (e.g., Quebrada Seca 3) present structured spaces with evidence of space preparation and maintenance activities (Aschero, Elkin, & Pintar, 1991) . This has been interpreted as a mobility strategy based on regular returns to certain places, possibly associated to well-established seasonal rounds/circuits (Aschero & Hocsman, 2011) . Paleoenvironmental data from Las Pitas indicate that during this period the river's hydrological behavior was characterized by shallow perennial flow and limited development of organic and stagnant marshes within an otherwise regional arid context (PI).

This circumscription coincided with the prevailing, extremely arid conditions predominant at the regional (puna) level. These conditions would have created environmental barriers to hunter-gatherer mobility (Hocsman, 2006; Aschero & Hocsman, 2011) . Furthermore, during this period, pre-existing local environmental factors, such as the differential availability of wetlands between river basins, would also have played an important role in human settlement within Antofagasta de la Sierra. For example, the Las Pitas River had different reaches with favorable environmental conditions for food procurement. This ecological situation supports our proposal that the river reaches with more wetlands may have been favored by huntergatherers, an interpretation that is supported by the human occupation strategies recorded in archaeological sites along the river during this period.",

The presence of stalks of this crop in the residential base may be interpreted as a local experimentation/domestication process or alternatively, as the incorporation of an already consolidated practice (Aguirre, 2007; Aschero & Hocsman, 2011; Babot, 2011) . Several microthermal cultigens such as tubers (Babot, 2011) are also present. Probably, more humid conditions with a sustained baseflow and peat formation associated with PII for the Las Pitas River would have generated the appropriate background to conduct initial experiments or introduce cultigens into the study area at this early period.

Such changes would have resulted from the implementation of a new strategy for protecting the herd, leading to a gradual domestication process (Grant Lett-Brown, 2014) . Pastoralism would have developed in areas with hydrological resources, including wetlands within a regional context of generalized aridity. Consequently, hunter-gatherers' close interrelation with the environment is not only defined in terms of their search for, and exploitation of, available wetlands. Rather they should also be seen as active agents in their environment, generating changes and impacting their surroundings at the same time, for instance through the domestication of plants and animals (Grana, 2013) . All in all, there would have been a permanent interrelationship between hunter-gatherer societies and the environment, generating important changes in socioeconomic dynamics and the emergence of agropastoral societies.",

Through analysis of Las Pitas and Miriguaca alluvial stratigraphy including diatom assemblages, we infer that landscape elements such as topography, hydrogeology, and geomorphology have conditioned the effects of broad-scale climate change on local environments, minimizing the impact of aridity during the middle Holocene. For example, the high altitude catchment of the Las Pitas River basin collected more water from seasonal orographic precipitation during middle-to-late Holocene minor humid pulses, resulting in more springs and larger wetlands than along the Miriguaca River. The higher elevation catchment facilitated the development of a more stable flow regime, indicated by the presence of more FA3 and FA4 sedimentary facies along the lower Las Pitas River.",

This likely led to a territorial demarcation at the familial group or lineage level in and between rivers, as evidenced in the access to specific lithic resources and in the characteristics of both art and projectile point design that follow distinctive styles/features specific to certain areas along both rivers (Aschero & Hocsman, 2011) .",

This social complexity set the basis for later agropastoral societies in this area of the southeastern Atacama puna.
