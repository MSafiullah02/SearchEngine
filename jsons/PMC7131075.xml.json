Issues explored included identification of the factors influencing the impact of these events, the relative impact of these three events on these organisations, and their short- and medium-term responses. The study also highlighted aspects of the broader operating environment, such as role of organisational policies in guiding responses to these events, and compared the events of 2001 with other \u2018shocks\u2019 experienced by the tourism industry. This paper, drawn from the broader study, focuses specifically on the preparedness of organisations to respond to these events, in terms of the role of policies in guiding their responses; the personnel or human resource (HR) strategies implemented, and the postscript, the extent of organisational learning which had occurred.",

Faulkner (2001, p. 138) has distilled the work of a number of authors and indicated that the key elements of crisis situations are:\u2022a triggering event, which is so significant that it challenges the existing structure, routine operations or survival of the organization,\u2022high threat, short decision time and an element of surprise and urgency,\u2022a perception of an inability to cope among those directly affected,\u2022a turning point, when decisive change, which may have both positive and negative connotation, is imminent,\u2022characterised by \u2018fluid, unstable, dynamic\u2019 situations.\n",

            "text": "The attacks on the World Trade Centre clearly demonstrate the potential risk which terrorism poses for the tourism industry. A number of authors have highlighted the fact that tourists have become soft targets and are at risk from hijacking and terrorism (Faulkner, 2001). Furthermore, studies have shown that tourists substitute risky destinations with safer choices, demonstrate a delayed reaction to terrorism and exhibit cultural differences in their reactions to risk (Sonmez, 1998, pp. 427\u2013428). For example, as a result of terrorist activity in 1985, 1.8 million Americans changed their foreign plans their following year (Sonmez & Graefe, 1998, p. 121). When the HIH Insurance Company collapsed on 15 March 2001, it was Australia's second largest general insurer, with almost 40 per cent of the public liability market. In the following (June) quarter, the net premium for insurers increased by 7.5 per cent, indicating that HIH's rivals had taken advantage of its collapse to obtain premium price rises which had been limited by competition (White, 2002). The terrorist attacks further compounded the impact on insurance premiums. Switzer (2002) records that premium forecasts made before September 11 indicated that the rises would be 25 per cent at the most, but after these attacks, the increases could be as high as 1000 per cent in some cases, as occurred in Thorpedale, Victoria. The public liability premium for the annual potato festival has risen 1000 per cent since 2000. In Tumbarumba, southern New South Wales, the 2002 Easter Tooma Gymkhana was cancelled after premium rises from $1600 to $10,000 (Hughes, 2002).",

However, during such times, staffing levels may have to be adjusted and it is imperative that organisations have appropriate policies in place to guide their responses. The use of casualised workforces has been one strategy which has allowed organisations to cope with variations in demand. Indeed, workforce \u2018flexibility\u2019 has been seen as the answer to uncertainty (Pollert, 1988, p. 281). The deregulation of the industrial relations system has been carried out in the name of increased labour flexibility in the following areas:1.Numerical\u2014the right to hire and fire staff to suit prevailing economic conditions;2.Work time\u2014the ability to adjust time and quantity of work time with relation to overtime, shift work, flexible starting times and stand down arrangements;3.Functional\u2014the ability to extend the range of tasks a worker can perform;4.Wage\u2014the ability to alter wages and conditions to suit the prevailing economic conditions;5.Procedural\u2014the establishment of a procedural framework which will allow consultation and negotiation to occur at an enterprise level between an employer and their employees (Buultjens & Howard, 2001, p. 61).

This period of learning has three phases, namely, defensiveness, openness and forgetfulness. When faced with a crisis, managers and employees involved may feel defensive and be moved to protect themselves. However, once the immediate threat or incident has passed, they may be open to understanding their organisation's vulnerabilities and assessing its performance in managing the crisis. It is in this phase of openness when most learning can take place. However, the extent to which organisational members are open to learning and the duration of this phase are largely dependent on the behaviour of the top management. After the crisis, operations must be restored as soon as possible. Hence, the sense of urgency which motivates a desire for change is lost and all the superficial learning is forgotten (Kovoor-Misra & Nathan, 2000).

Roux-Dufort (2000, p. 26) suggests that \u2018the organization's priority is to come back and maintain the status quo as soon as possible rather than exploring the extent to which the crisis is a privileged moment during which to understand things differently.\u2019 Confirming this view, Henderson (1999, p. 177) reports that the results of a survey of leading tourist attractions in Singapore investigating the consequences of the Asian financial crisis indicated that there was no crisis management planning and that there was a need for such planning in the light of the nature of the travel and tourism industry, with its exposure to risk and disaster. This finding confirms the observation made by Cassedy (1991, p. 1) that many tourism organisations do not include the possibility of disasters in their strategic plans. Indeed, Cassedy observes that \u2018given the travel industry's dependence on transportation, the exchange rate, the political situation, discretionary income and weather, this industry is highly susceptible to unexpected change\u2019 (Cassedy, 1991, p. 3). This absence of some form of crisis management planning perhaps reflects the fatal mistake made by many businesses that a crisis will not happen to them (Spillan & Hough, 2003). They report the results of a survey of small businesses in Pennsylvania and New York, which indicated from the 162 responses, that little emphasis had been placed on crisis planning in these businesses, the majority of which had less than 25 employees. The study also concluded that \u2018concern for crises was generated from the past experience of those crises\u2026\u2019 (Spillan & Hough, 2003, p. 406).",

It also gives operators an opportunity to review their cost structures and rationalize if they need to and understand that their, their existing clientele is of utmost importance and their staff morale and staff, ability to be able to hold staff during those periods is also important in producing a product that continues to be outstanding.

From our point of view, it's caused us to look fairly closely at the business in that respect. \u2026 it sharpens us up in our business management approach, it sharpens us up in our service delivery, because we\u2019re now competing for a tighter market.

The lack of preparedness for such events was demonstrated by the widespread absence of policies to guide organisational responses, confirming the observations of Henderson (1999), that while there was a need for crisis management planning, none had been done. The need to support personnel in such times by the provision of reliable information, reported by Heath (1998), and the importance of workforce flexibility in areas such as work-time, mentioned by Buultjens and Howard (2001), have also been confirmed. In contrast to the comments of Kovoor-Misra and Nathan (2000) and Roux-Dufort (2000), there was evidence that organisational learning had taken place, which confirmed the observation of Faulkner (2001) that such events can have positive consequences.",

Most importantly, it must be recognised that organisations are now operating in an increasingly volatile environment and it is imperative that good networks are developed and maintained so that accurate information can be gained on which appropriate responses to any crisis can be planned. It is vital that organisations become flexible in their approach to their operations, one aspect of such flexibility being with respect to staffing. In this study, work-time flexibility has been shown to be particularly important means whereby staff could be retained, as there was a widespread reluctance to retrench staff, who would be needed once the industry had recovered. It is also critical that lessons learnt during such times are not lost, but become part of the \u2018corporate memory\u2019, such that they can guide future decision-making.",
