The world has witnessed several viral epidemics in past twenty years that include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Recently, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China and reported to China Country Office of The World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. The National Health Commission of China reported that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan City. The etiological agent of the atypical pneumonia was isolated on January 7, 2020 by the Chinese authorities as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus identified was shared to other countries to develop specific diagnostic kits on January 12, 2020. Subsequently, the Ministry of Public Health Thailand, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan and Republic of Korea reported their first imported case of lab-confirmed 2019-nCoV on 13 January 13, January 15 and January 20, 2020 respectively. Subsequently, International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses termed it SARS-Cov-2, due to similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the SARS. On February 11, 2020, the WHO announced that the disease caused by this new virus as a \"COVID-19,\" which is the acronym of \"coronavirus disease 2019\". On March 11, 2020 , WHO declared this disease as pandemic. As of March 30, 2020, WHO has reported 693,224 case and 33,104 death, that has occurred worldwide [1].",

Genomic sequence studies of COVID-19 have identified nearly 50%, 79% and 96% similarity to MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and bat SARSrelated coronavirus, respectively [7e9]. The specific route of transmission to human from natural reservoirs is still yet to be known, however, some of the studies suggests pangolin could be the intermediate mammalian hosts. Since spike protein of SAR-CoV-2 are nearly identical to one virus isolated from pangolin, it is believed that pangolins could have provided a partial spike gene to SARS-CoV-2, to infect mammals [10, 11] . A recent study has also shown a development of new variations at the functional sites in the receptor-binding domain of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 and viruses from pangolin, likely caused due to either a natural selection or mutations or recombination or both [12] .",

The longest time from infection to symptoms was 12.5 days (95% CI, 9.2e18 days). The Chinese epidemic also doubled about every seven days and on average, each patient transmits the infection to an additional 2.2 individuals, suggesting the basic reproduction number (R0 or R naught) to be 2.2, which is a bit lesser compared to R0 of the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic of nearly 3.0, in 2002e2003 [14, 15] . An epidemiological and transmission difference in characteristics between SARS-CoV1, MERS and Covid-19 has been summarized in Table 1. A recent study from a genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n \u00bc 103) found this virus to be evolving into two major types (designated as L and S) with two different SNPs. While the L type is more prevalent (~70%), aggressive and spread more quickly, as seen in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the S type (~30%) is an ancestral version, evolutionarily older, and less aggressive. It appears that the frequency of the L type has decreased after early January 2020, and it is hypothesized that the change in selective pressure might change the behavior of this virus. It is thought that coercive human interventions may have placed a more severe selective pressure on the L type to mutate to S type. Conversely, the S type might have been increased also due to a relatively weaker selective pressure [13] .",

While ELISA has sensitivity of 87.3%, Card test has a sensitivity of 82.4%, and both have specificity of 100%. However, card test is convenient, cheaper and offers a rapid turnover [25] . ELISA is based on Rp3 nucleoprotein to detect IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Although ELISA has quick turn over time, however it may have a false positive results due to N (Nucleocapsid) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 [16, 26] . Cross reactivity is expected with SARS-CoV-1 infection since there is 90% homology in genetic sequence with SARS-CoV-2.

For RT-PCR, specimen collection from the upper/lower respiratory tract or sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples to be performed under strict precautions, and should be taken as early as symptom onset, to obtain high virus concentrations [28] . It should be noted that RT-PCR may take few hours to 2 days for reporting and second sample with different viral gene may be needed if initial test is negative. Moreover, RT-PCR may be false negative at a times e.g. low viral load in very early phase or in late phase of disease, mutation of COVID-19 virus or other technical difficulties in collection of samples. Similarly, result may be false-positive in influenza or other respiratory pathogens. In either case it is important to remain vigilant. Other issues with RT-PCR is incorrect sample collection and processing, potential risk to health care workers due to aerosol transmission, beside delayed report delivery, requirement of expertise, setup of laboratory and the cost [27] .",

However, during second week, the serological test had higher sensitivity than RT-PCR. Collectively, this suggest ideally to combine both the modalities of test to increase the sensitivity for early detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 [27, 28] .
