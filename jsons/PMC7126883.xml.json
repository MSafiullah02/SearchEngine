Encephalitis is strictly a pathologic diagnosis, in which neuroinflammation, brain tissue damage, and a pathogen are detected. In clinical practice, a diagnosis is made presumptively based on a constellation of clinical findings that often includes fever and neurologic dysfunction, coupled with clinical testing including electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuroimaging findings (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), with or without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies. Despite an extensive work-up, it is often not possible to identify the cause of these symptoms. Population-based studies, such as the California Encephalitis Project (CEP), have shown how limited the current diagnostic methods can be. A 2007 CEP database review found that a confirmed or probable agent was identified in only 16% of cases.1 Fifty-eight percent of the patients enrolled were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). In addition to highlighting the many cases without a known cause, these studies have led to further understanding the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and noninfectious causes such as N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies as a cause of encephalitis.",

Between 1998 and 2005, the CEP enrolled 1570 patients 6 months old or older (median 23 years) with altered mental status and at least 1 of the following: fever, seizure, focal neurologic signs, CSF pleocytosis, abnormal EEG, or neuroimaging findings consistent with encephalitis. Patient data including exposures, laboratory data, clinical data, and demographics were collected. Testing for a battery of 16 infectious causes was performed on available CSF, brain, respiratory, acute-phase, and convalescent-phase serum samples; in addition, an additional 24 infectious causes were screened based on epidemiologic factors. Despite this thorough work-up, a confirmed or probable infectious cause was identified in only 244/1570 (16%) patients and a noninfectious cause was identified in 122/1570 (8%). A 2-year prospective study of children (mean age 6 years) admitted with encephalitis to a large tertiary-care children\u2019s hospital had similar results. Fifty children underwent a comprehensive infectious work-up and a confirmed or probable agent was detected in 20/50 (40%) cases: M pneumoniae (9 cases), M pneumoniae and enterovirus (2 cases), and herpes simplex virus (4 cases) were the most common.3\nBox 1Causes of encephalitis\n\n\nAbbreviations: \u03b1AMPAR, AMPA receptor antibody; \u03b1GABABR, gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor antibody; \u03b1NMDAR, NMDAR antibody; \u03b1VGKC, voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody; ADEM, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; EEE, eastern equine encephalitis virus; EV, enterovirus; HHV-6, human herpesvirus type 6; HSV, herpes simplex virus; LCM, lymphocytic choriomeningitis; VZV, Varicella zoster virus; WNV, West Nile virus.",

Patients may present to the ICU with altered mental status for a variety of reasons including shock, hypoxia, metabolic derangements, intoxication, trauma, and CNS infections (Box 3\n). Therefore, in cases of encephalitis, a high index of suspicion is required to initiate timely therapy. On arrival, the initial evaluation should begin with assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation. Hypoxia, hypotension, fever, and seizures should be promptly treated to reduce the likelihood of secondary brain injury. If there is coma (GCS\u22648) or loss of airway protective reflexes, a definitive airway should be obtained with endotracheal intubation. Following the initial resuscitation, a focused history and physical examination should be performed. The history is often obtained from caregivers because of the age of the patient and/or encephalopathy. The physician should be alert to any preceding symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and exposures that may assist in diagnosis (Box 4\n). A physical examination should then be performed with particular attention to level of consciousness, airway protective reflexes, seizure activity, and physical clues that may point to a particular cause. Although not validated in patients with nontraumatic brain injury, the GCS can be performed quickly and is helpful to standardize examinations, quantify the degree of neurologic dysfunction, and monitor for clinical deterioration or improvement. Bacterial meningitis may present with encephalitic symptoms and is unlikely to be excluded until the results of laboratory CSF studies and cultures are available.Box 3Differential diagnosis of acute encephalopathy\n\nData from Singhi PD.

Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with space-occupying lesions, evidence of increased ICP seen on neuroimaging, or coagulopathy. Our recommendation is to avoid lumbar puncture in patients with altered mental status, because this may reflect intracranial hypertension (compression of both cerebral hemispheres and/or the reticular activating system). Even after acquiring imaging studies, we recommend deferring lumbar puncture, because neuroimaging studies are insensitive in detecting intracranial hypertension in patients with meningoencephalitis. The insensitivity of CT scans in the detection of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may be related to globally high pressures within all intracranial CSF compartments, in contrast with external compression from mass lesions, for instance, that result in compression of cisterns. Furthermore, lumbar puncture in the presence of increased ICP increases the pressure gradient from within the skull to the spine, even after removal of the needle, because CSF can leak into soft tissues after penetration of the dura. We also recommend delaying lumbar puncture in patients with hemodynamic instability or respiratory compromise until these issues can be corrected.",

Initial neuroimaging is abnormal in up to half of patients with encephalitis and therefore cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis.1, 3 In the case of acute viral encephalitis, a study of 18 patients by Kiro\u011flu and colleagues8 found diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to be superior to conventional MRI in the detection of early lesions and depiction of lesion borders. A study by Teixeira and colleagues9 of children with herpes encephalitis found that DWI detected additional lesions or, in 1 case in which conventional MRI was normal, showed acute infection. In addition to added sensitivity, there are characteristic neuroimaging patterns that may point to a particular cause. For example, HSV encephalitis may show edema or hemorrhage localized to the temporal lobes and bilateral temporal lobe involvement is nearly pathognomonic for HSV encephalitis, but this tends to be a late finding. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a virus known to cause a poliolike rhombencephalitis, may cause lesions seen with T2-weighted imaging and DWI within the brainstem and spinal cord. Eastern equine and Flavivirus (WNV, St Louis encephalitis virus [SEV], Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV]) encephalitis also characteristically show lesions in the brainstem. MRI can also be helpful to make the diagnosis of ADEM, which is characterized by multifocal subcortical and central white matter areas of T2 or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal abnormality in the subcortical and central white matter.10\n",

Patients who developed refractory status epilepticus were more likely to have a generalized or multifocal pattern on their initial EEG and more likely to have poor neurologic outcome at 6 months on Glasgow Outcome Scale score and medically refractory epilepsy.14 In the CEP, 56% of patients had seizure(s) responsive to standard medical therapy, whereas only 4% developed refractory seizures and required induced coma for management. In this cohort, patients with refractory status epilepticus were more likely to be young (median age 10 years); have fever (93%), prodromal respiratory illness (57%), or gastrointestinal illness (64%); and less likely to have a CSF pleocytosis (47%) or abnormal imaging (16%).

In general, a seizing patient is treated emergently with lorazepam or diazepam, followed by maintenance therapy with fosphenytoin. If a patient in status epilepticus fails to respond to initial dose(s) of benzodiazepines, it is unlikely that the next agent in protocols (phenobarbital, phenytoin) will be effective. In The Veteran Affairs Cooperative Study by Treiman and colleagues,16 a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 4 intravenous treatment options for status epilepticus, the first antiepileptic drug administered failed to resolve status epilepticus in 45% of cases; in cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the first agent failed in 85% of cases. Second and third agents were successful less than 10% of the time. To effectively treat status epilepticus in pediatric patients, clinicians should consider high-dose continuous infusions of midazolam or pentobarbital to produce medically induced coma. Patients receiving this therapy require endotracheal intubation for airway protection and ventilatory support and often require hemodynamic support in the form of fluid boluses or vasopressors. EEG should be used to monitor and titrate the midazolam or pentobarbital infusion, with typical targets being suppression of seizures or burst-suppression pattern.17 It is our practice to titrate our therapy to burst-suppression with interburst interval of 10 seconds for 24 hours followed by a taper over 24 to 48 hours monitoring for recurrence of seizure activity. In adults with refractory status epilepticus, propofol infusion with or without midazolam may also be used to induce coma. However, because of the risk of propofol infusion syndrome (cardiovascular collapse, lactic acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and rhabdomyolysis), particularly in prolonged infusions and in children, we caution against its use in pediatric patients for treatment of refractory status epilepticus.",

In this study, the physicians targeted a CPP greater than 70 mm Hg in children 2 years old or older and greater than 60 mm Hg in children less than 2 years old. Their protocol called for a fluid bolus when CPP was less than threshold and central venous pressure (CVP) was less than 10 mm Hg. If CPP was less than threshold and CVP adequate, a dopamine infusion was added followed by epinephrine if necessary. Once on vasopressors, if CPP remained less than threshold as a consequence of ICP greater than 20 mm Hg, then boluses of mannitol were given every 4 to 6 hours, with urinary losses replaced with isotonic fluid. The mortality in patients with encephalitis was 6/14 (42%); in 4 of these cases, death was attributed to refractory intracranial hypertension. A comparison of the survivors without neurologic sequelae, survivors with sequelae, and children who died found no significant difference across these groups in terms of initial CPP or ICP and mean CPP and ICP over the first 48 hours.

Hypertonic saline achieved a greater reduction in ICP compared with mannitol, normal saline, or Ringer s lactate with a longer sustained effect when given as a continuous infusion rather than as boluses. However, there was no significant difference in mean ICP between the groups. Boluses of glycerol and mannitol induced a transient reduction in ICP. For children with cerebral malaria, mannitol boluses had a dose-response effect in moderately increased ICP (ICP>20 mm Hg, CPP<50 mm Hg), but not with severely increased ICP (ICP>40 mm Hg, CPP<40 mm Hg).

More recent evidence, such as case reports of patients in whom the organism is cultured from brain parenchyma and detected by PCR in the CSF, support M pneumoniae as a cause of encephalitis. As opposed to bacterial or viral CNS infections, in which interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha are increased, increased CSF levels of interleukin (IL) 6 and IL-8 (neutrophil chemotactic factor) have been measured.35 These findings are consistent with the neutrophilic infiltrate seen on histology after fatal cases.36\n",

Not only is the diagnosis difficult and sometimes unconfirmed, but encephalitis remains a disease without clear evidence-based therapies or even therapeutic goals to strive for toward the prevention of unacceptably high neurologic sequelae. In essence, acute encephalitis remains one of the few diseases where one can feel as though they are \u201cflying blind\u201d. Management should focus on initial stabilization, identification of cause, and treatment and/or prevention of primary and secondary brain injury. Clinical seizures should be emergently treated and may require medically induced coma for refractory status epilepticus. A stepwise approach to therapy guided by ICP/CPP may be used to treat intracranial hypertension. If increased ICP is suspected in comatose patients without ICP monitoring, ICP-targeted therapy is an option. Causes such as H1N1 influenza, M pneumoniae, and anti-NMDAR encephalitis have been diagnosed more frequently in recent years because of outbreaks (H1N1) or improved understanding of the pathophysiology affecting these patients (M pneumoniae, anti-NMDAR). Future studies should evaluate ICU management of these patients to determine the value of invasive monitoring and neuroprotective treatment strategies.",

There is also involvement of the left temporal lobe (arrowhead). Mild shift to the left of the midline structures is identified (dashed arrow). Postcontrast coronal T1-weighted image (right) shows enhancement consistent with leptomeningitis over the right frontal temporal region (arrows). (B) A 12-month-old patient with H1N1 influenza A infection and seizures. A focus of increased signal identified in the left posterior putamen on diffusion-weighted image (left, arrow) is consistent with restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema), as shown on the apparent diffusion coefficient map (right, arrow). This lesion may result from direct brain viral entry as well as from H1N1-related vasculitides in the territory supplied by the perforating arteries. (C) A 16-year-old patient affected by ADEM. Sagittal (left) and coronal (right) FLAIR images show confluent T2-FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally (arrows). A tumorlike ADEM lesion of the left middle cerebellar peduncle extending to the cerebellar white matter is also identified (arrowheads). (D) A 26-year-old patient with NMDAR encephalitis and ovarian teratoma.
