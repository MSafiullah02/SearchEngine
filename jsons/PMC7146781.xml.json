FeLV has been reported to cause a pruritic, crusting dermatosis of the head, and sometimes legs, paws, and trunk.",

In this case report, a cat had mildly alopecic, erythematous nodules on the neck and forelimbs that were associated with dermal vasculitis in the presence of coronavirus antigen. This case is an important reminder that viruses well known for causing systemic illness can also directly induce dermatologic lesions in cats.",
