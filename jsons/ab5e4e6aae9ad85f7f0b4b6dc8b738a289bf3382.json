            "text": "Plus-strand (+) RNA viruses exhibit an enormous genetic diversity that also applies to their RNA synthesis machinery. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the only enzyme to be absolutely conserved, whereas other replicative and accessory protein domains vary considerably, in terms of both number and arrangement in the polyprotein (Koonin and Dolja 1993) . Despite this diversity, phylogenetic relationships have been identified and used to group +RNA viruses into large superfamilies (or classes) (Goldbach 1987; Strauss and Strauss 1988; Koonin and Dolja 1993) . As few as three superfamilies, the picornavirus-like, flavivirus-like and alphavirus-like viruses, were proposed to accommodate the vast majority of +RNA viruses infecting animals, plants, and microorganisms (Koonin and Dolja 1993) . Interestingly, coronaviruses were among the few exceptions that did not easily fit into one of the established superfamilies; and the sequence analysis and characterization of arteri-, toro-, and roniviruses suggested that coronaviruses and their relatives may indeed exemplify a viral life form that, in several fundamental aspects, differs from that of other +RNA viruses (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c; Snijder et al. 1990a; den Boon et al. 1991; Snijder and Horzinek 1993; de Vries et al. 1997; Lai and Cavanagh 1997; Snijder and Meulenberg 1998; Cowley et al. 2000) . Thus coronaviruses (and all their relatives) (1) produce a nested set of 3 0 -coterminal mRNAs (Lai et al. 1983; Spaan et al. 1983 ), (2) use ribosomal frameshifting into the -1 frame to express their key replicative functions (Brierley et al. 1987 (Brierley et al. , 1989 , (3) have a unique set of conserved functional domains that are arranged in the viral polyproteins in the following order: chymotrypsin-like proteinase, RdRp, helicase, and endoribonuclease (from N-to C-terminus) (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c; Gorbalenya 2001; , and (4) use RdRp and helicase activities that, based on the conservation of signature motifs, have been classified as belonging to the RdRp and helicase superfamilies 1, respectively (Koonin and Dolja 1993) . Both the combination of two superfamily 1 domains and their sequential order in the polyprotein, with RdRp preceding the helicase, is extremely unusual (if not unique) among +RNA viruses. On the basis of these and other common properties, a new virus order, the Nidovirales, was introduced several years ago (Cavanagh 1997) . At present, there is only little information on the toro-and ronivirus replicases, whereas information on the replicases of corona-and arteriviruses is accumulating rapidly. On the basis of both serological relationships and sequence sim-ilarity, coronaviruses have been classified into three groups (Siddell 1995) , with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E, group 1), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, group 1), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, group 2), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, group 3) being the best-studied coronaviruses to date. Because of its medical importance, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (tentatively classified as belonging to group 2) ) is currently becoming a major topic of coronavirus research.",

In some cases (for example, SARS-CoV) complete genome sequences are available for several or even multiple isolates (Ruan et al. 2003) . The genome sizes of coronaviruses range between 27.3 (HCoV-229E) and 31.3 (MHV) kb, making coronaviruses the largest RNA viruses currently known. About two-thirds of the coronavirus genome (~20,000 bases) are devoted to encoding the viral replicase that mediates viral RNA synthesis (Thiel et al. 2001b ) and, possibly, other functions. The replicase gene is comprised of two large open reading frames, designated ORF1a and ORF1b, that are located at the 5 0 end of the genome. The upstream ORF1a encodes a polyprotein of 450-500 kDa, termed polyprotein (pp)1a, whereas ORF1a and ORF1b together encode pp1ab (750-800 kDa) (Fig. 1) . Expression of the C-terminal, ORF1b-encoded half of pp1ab requires a (-1) ribosomal frameshift during translation. It is generally accepted that frameshifting depends on two critical elements, the \"slippery\" sequence, UUUAAAC, at which the ribosome shifts into the (-1) reading frame and a tripartite RNA pseudoknot structure located more downstream, near the ORF1a/1b junction (Brierley et al. 1987 (Brierley et al. , 1989 . In vitro experiments using reticulocyte lysates indicate that frameshifting occurs in about 20%-30% of the translation events, but it is not known whether this reflects the situation in vivo. The fact that the core replicative functions, RdRp and helicase, are encoded by ORF1b implies that their expression critically depends Fig. 1 . Overview of the domain organization and proteolytic processing of coronavirus replicase polyproteins. Shown are the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The processing endproducts of pp1a are designated nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to nsp11, and those on ribosomal frameshifting, suggesting a requirement for a specific molar ratio between ORF1a-and ORF1b-encoded protein functions.",

            "text": "Initial sequence analyses in the late 1980s suggested a large divergence of the coronavirus replicase from the replicative machinery of other +RNA viruses. Accordingly, at this time, only very few functional predictions could be made for the~800-kDa replicative polyproteins of coronaviruses . In 1989, a detailed comparative sequence analysis of the IBV replicase gene (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c ) was pubof pp1ab are designated nsp1 to nsp10 and nsp12 to nsp16. Note that nsp1 to nsp10 may be released by proteolytic processing of either pp1a or pp1ab, whereas nsp11 is processed from pp1a and nsp12 to nsp16 are processed from pp1ab. nsp11 and nsp12 share a number of residues at the N-terminus. Alternative names that have been used in the past to designate specific processing products are given. Cleavage sites that are processed by the viral main proteinase are indicated by red arrowheads, and sites that are processed by the accessory papainlike proteinases 1 and 2 are indicated by orange and blue arrowheads, respectively. Ac, acidic domain ; PL1, accessory papainlike cysteine proteinase 1 (Baker et al. 1989 (Baker et al. , 1993 Gorbalenya et al. 1991; Herold et al. 1998 ); X, X domain , which is predicted to have adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1 00 -phosphatase activity ; SUD, SARS-CoV unique domain ; PL2, accessory papainlike cysteine proteinase 2 Liu et al. 1995; Kanjanahaluethai and Baker 2000; Ziebuhr et al. 2001) ; Y, Y domain containing a transmembrane domain and a putative Cys/His-rich metal-binding domain; TM1, TM2, and TM3, putative transmembrane domains 1 to 3; 3CL, 3C-like main proteinase (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c; Liu and Brown 1995; Ziebuhr et al. 1995; Lu et al. 1995) ; RdRp, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c) ; HEL, helicase domain (Seybert et al. 2000a ); ExoN, putative 3 0 -to-5 0 exonuclease ; XendoU, putative poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease ; MT, putative S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2 0 -O-methyltransferase ; C/H, Cys/His-rich domains predicted to bind metal ions. Note that IBV pp1a and pp1ab do not have a counterpart of nsp1 of other coronaviruses. The papainlike cysteine proteinase 1 of IBV is crossed out to indicate that the domain is proteolytically inactive t lished in which the RdRp and NTPase/helicase domains were predicted to be encoded by the 5 0 region of ORF1b. Furthermore, a putative chymotrypsin-like (picornavirus 3C-like) cysteine proteinase domain (3CL pro ) was identified in ORF1a and predictions on putative cleavage sites in the C-terminal regions of pp1a and pp1ab were made. The proteinase was found to be flanked by membrane domains on both sides. The coronavirus replicative proteins were proposed to be only extremely distantly related to the corresponding homologs of other +RNA viruses, and many of the pp1a/pp1ab-encoded enzymes appeared to have unique structural properties. Thus, for example, the helicase was proposed to be linked at its N-terminus to a complex zinc-binding domain (ZBD) consisting of 12 Cys/His residues (see below). In several cases, mutations in otherwise strictly conserved signature sequences were found. Thus the typical G-D-D signature of the conserved RdRp motif VI (Koonin 1991) was found to be replaced by S-D-D in the coronavirus homolog and the G(A)-X-H motif conserved in the S1 subsite of the substrate-binding pocket of picornavirus 3C proteinases (Gorbalenya et al. 1989a (Gorbalenya et al. , 1989c was substituted with Y-M-H. The predictions on functional domains, putative active-site residues, and proteinase cleavage sites were continuously elaborated and extended when more coronavirus replicase sequences became available Lee et al. 1991; Eleouet et al. 1995; Chouljenko et al. 2001; Kocherhans et al. 2001; Penzes et al. 2001; Ziebuhr et al. 2001; Snijder et al. 2003) . In these studies, papainlike cysteine proteinase (PL pro ) domains , a conserved domain of corona-, alpha-, and rubiviruses, termed X 1 , an acidic domain (Ac) of unknown function, and a domain (termed Y) with putative metal-binding and membrane-targeting functions were identified in the coronavirus ORF1a sequence (Fig. 1) . Overall, the sequence similarities between the replicase genes of prototypic viruses from the three coronavirus groups corresponded well to those of the structural protein regions, providing support for the traditional classification of coronaviruses into three groups, which previously was based on structural protein sequence relationships and serological cross-reactivities (Siddell 1995) .",

            "text": "Recently, the list of putative enzymes involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis was extended considerably. Thus, in the context of a bioinformatics study of the SARS-CoV genome, as many as five (putative) coro-naviral RNA processing activities were identified (Fig. 1) . These include (1) a 3 0 -to-5 0 exonuclease (ExoN) of the DEDD superfamily (Zuo and Deutscher 2001) , (2) a poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease (XendoU) (Laneve et al. 2003) , (3) an S-adenosylmethioninedependent ribose 2 0 -O-methyltransferase (2 0 -O-MT) of the RrmJ family (B\u00fcgl et al. 2000) , (4) an ADRP (Martzen et al. 1999) , and (5) a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD) (Martzen et al. 1999; Nasr and Filipowicz 2000) . Four of the activities are conserved in all coronaviruses, indicating their essential role in the coronaviral life cycle. In fact, the number of enzymes predicted to be involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis and modification is unique in RNA viruses and indicates a remarkable functional complexity, which approaches that of DNA replication. Three of the newly identified activities, ExoN (nsp14), XendoU (nsp15), and 2 0 -O-MT (nsp16), are arranged in pp1ab as a single protein block downstream of the RdRp (nsp12) and helicase (nsp13) domains ( Fig. 1) , suggesting that their activities cooperate in the same metabolic pathway(s). This conclusion is supported by the identification of a stable processing intermediate in IBV-infected cells that exactly comprises these three domains . It is also supported by the fact that nsp14-16 expression involves common regulatory mechanisms, (1) ribosomal frameshifting and (2) 3CL pro -mediated proteolysis. As a first clue to possible functions encoded by this gene block in ORF1b, an exciting parallel to cellular RNA processing pathways was found by Snijder et al. (2003) . Thus homologs of the coronavirus nsp14-16 processing products cleave and process mRNAs to produce small nucleolar (sno) RNAs that, in turn, guide specific 2 0 -O-ribose methylations of rRNA (Kiss 2001; Filipowicz and Pogacic 2002) .",

This enzyme is universally conserved in nidoviruses and was previously referred to as \"nidovirus-specific conserved domain\" (Snijder et al. 1990b; den Boon et al. 1991; de Vries et al. 1997) . In contrast, CPD is only encoded by toroviruses and a subset of group 2 coronaviruses (excluding SARS-CoV) . Given that coronaviruses and arteriviruses are generally believed to use very similar replication and transcription strategies, it is intriguing that, out of the four activities conserved in all coronaviruses (ExoN, XendoU, 2 0 -O-MT, and ADRP), only one activity (XendoU) is conserved in arteriviruses. One may therefore speculate that (1) arterivirus and coronavirus RNA synthesis mechanisms differ in several molecular details or (2) the viruses interact differentially with RNA processing pathways of the host cell. Alternatively, the extra functions encoded by coronaand toroviruses (and, to a lesser extent, roniviruses) may be required to synthesize and maintain the extremely large (~30 kb) RNA genomes of these viruses. Thus, on the basis of its sequence similarity with cellular 3 0 -to-5 0 exonucleases involved in proofreading, repair, and/or recombination, ExoN has been speculated to be involved in related mechanisms that may be required for the life cycle of corona-, toro-, and roniviruses but may be dispensable for the much smaller arteriviruses .

Proteinase inhibitors that block proteolytic processing also obviate coronavirus replication, illustrating the essential role of pp1a/pp1ab processing for viral RNA synthesis (Kim et al. 1995) . On the basis of their physiological role, coronavirus proteinases can be classified into accessory proteinases, which are responsible for cleaving the more divergent N-proximal pp1a/pp1ab regions at two or three sites, and main proteinases, which cleave the major part of the polyproteins at 11 conserved sites and also release the conserved key replicative functions, such as RdRp, helicase, and three of the RNA processing domains (Ziebuhr et al. 2000; Snijder et al. 2003) . All coronaviruses encode one main proteinase and, depending on the virus (see below and Fig. 1 ), one or two accessory proteinases. The accessory proteinases are papainlike cysteine proteinases that are designated PL pro (PL1 pro and PL2 pro ). The main proteinase is a cysteine proteinase with a serine proteinase-like structure (Anand et al. 2002) . In previous publications, two alternative designations have been used for this protein. The name main proteinase, M pro , is generally used to stress the dominant physiological role of this proteinase in coronavirus gene expression, whereas the name 3C-like proteinase is used to stress the (distant) relationship with picornavirus 3C proteinases, which is based on a common chymotrypsin-like two-b-barrel structure and similar substrate specificities (Gorbalenya et al. 1989a,c; Ziebuhr et al. 2000) . Despite this relationship, there are also important structural differences between picornavirus and coronavirus chymotrypsin-like proteinases (see below).",

The order of cleavages was found to be conserved among coronaviruses and appears to depend on the accessibility of specific sites in the context of the polyprotein ) as well as the primary and secondary structures of a given cleavage site. Thus deviation from the 3CL pro cleavage site consensus sequence, L-Q|(A,S,G), resulted in most cases in significantly reduced cleavage efficiencies (Ziebuhr and Siddell 1999; Fan et al. 2003) . Furthermore, substrate peptides adopting extended b-strand structures appear to be favored by 3CL pro over a-helical or disordered structures (Fan et al. 2003) . On the basis of these data, it is reasonable to postulate that coronavirus polyprotein processing occurs in a temporally coordinated manner, which might lead to activation and inactivation of specific functions in the course of the viral life cycle, as has been demonstrated for other +RNA viruses (Lemm et al. 1994; Vasiljeva et al. 2003) .",

The proteolytic activities of the MHV and HCoV-229E PL1 pro and PL2 pro domains and the IBV PL2 pro , which all reside in nsp3, have been characterized in detail (Ziebuhr et al. 2000) . Briefly, the MHV PL1 pro cleaves the nsp1|nsp2 and nsp2|3 sites, while PL2 pro processes the third site, nsp3|nsp4 (Baker et al. 1989 (Baker et al. , 1993 Dong and Baker 1994; Denison et al. 1995; Hughes et al. 1995; Bonilla et al. 1997; Teng et al. 1999; Kanjanahaluethai and Baker 2000; Kanjanahaluethai et al. 2003) . Also in HCoV-229E, PL1 pro was shown to cleave the nsp1|nsp2 and nsp2|nsp3 sites (Herold et al. 1998; Ziebuhr et al. 2001) . However, in the case of HCoV-229E, the regulation of proteolytic processing was shown to be more complex than previously thought. Thus PL2 pro (originally believed to process only the nsp3|nsp4 site) was demonstrated also to process the nsp2|nsp3 site. The nsp2|nsp3 cleavages mediated by PL1 pro and PL2 pro , respectively, were shown to occur at exactly the same scissile bond (Herold et al. 1998; Ziebuhr et al. 2001) . Whereas the PL1 pro -mediated cleavage proved to be slow and incomplete in vitro, PL2 pro cleaved this site efficiently under the same experimental conditions. Furthermore, evidence was obtained to suggest that the proteolytic activity of PL1 pro at the nsp2|nsp3 site is downregulated by PL2 pro by a noncompetitive mechanism . It was concluded that the activities of the two proteinase domains present in nsp3 are tightly regulated in HCoV-229E and, probably, also other coronaviruses, with PL2 pro playing a major role and dominating over the activity of PL1 pro . This conclusion is also supported by the conservation of PL2 pro in all coronaviruses Snijder et al. 2003) .",

The IBV PL1 pro domain, although being conserved, has lost its proteolytic activity in the course of evolution because of the accumulation of active site mutations . Apparently, IBV does not en-code a counterpart of the nsp1 protein of other coronaviruses. Thus there are only two cleavage sites in this region of pp1a/pp1ab, nsp2|nsp3 and nsp3|nsp4, which are both processed by PL2 pro (Lim and Liu 1998; Lim et al. 2000) . In SARS-CoV, only one PL pro is conserved (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003) . The domain occupies a position in pp1a/pp1ab that corresponds to that of the PL2 pro domains of other coronaviruses and therefore is considered an ortholog of coronavirus PL2 pro s . Obviously, the SARS-CoV PL2 pro must be responsible for the processing of all three sites identified in this region and, indeed, the activity of PL2 pro at the nsp2|nsp3 site was demonstrated recently . The arrangement of the N-terminal domains of SARS-CoV nsp3 differs from that of other coronaviruses Snijder et al. 2003) . Thus, the conserved ADRP domain (\"X\" in Fig. 1 ) resides immediately downstream of the acidic domain (Ac) in nsp3, a position that is occupied by PL1 pro in other coronaviruses. Further downstream, another domain of unknown function has been identified in the region separating the ADRP and PL2 pro domains. It has been termed \"SARS-CoV unique domain\" (SUD) (Fig. 1) .",

Furthermore, there are only very few PL1 pro versus PL2 pro lineage-specific residues, which do not provide sufficient evidence for clustering the PL1 pro and PL2 pro domains into two separate groups. Despite this divergency at the sequence level, coronavirus PL pro s share a number of common properties. Thus they all (1) process sites that are located in the N-terminal half of the replicase polyproteins, far upstream of the conserved ORF1b-encoded domains (Fig. 1) , (2) cleave sites that have at least one small residue (Gly, Ala) at the scissile bond (Dong and Baker 1994; Hughes et al. 1995; Bonilla et al. 1997; Herold et al. 1998; Lim and Liu 1998; Lim et al. 2000; Ziebuhr et al. 2001; Kanjanahaluethai et al. 2003) , (3) have a catalytic dyad consisting of Cys (followed by Trp or Tyr) and a downstream His (Baker et al. 1993; Herold et al. 1998; Lim and Liu 1998) , and (4) employ variants of the papainlike a+b fold Herold et al. 1999) . Molecular modeling suggests that the a and b domains are connected by a transcription factor-like domain that includes a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) essential for proteolytic activity (Herold et al. 1999) (Fig. 1) . It seems likely that the domain also has other functions, for example, in sg mRNA transcription. This hypothesis is based on (1) the sequence similarity with cellular transcription factors (Herold et al. 1999) and (2) the fact that the related ZBD-containing EAV nsp1 papainlike proteinase has a clearly established role in arterivirus sg mRNA synthesis (Tijms et al. 2001) .",

Surprisingly, however, phylogenetic trees inferred from multiple sequence comparisons of coronavirus PL pro s revealed that only the PL1 pro and PL2 pro domains of the most closely related coronaviruses were clustered together . Therefore, multiple independent gene duplications in different coronaviruses cannot be excluded entirely. Alternatively and much more probably, the above result can be interpreted to reflect homoplasy events that, subsequent to the initial gene duplication, have driven a parallel evolution of the two coronavirus PL pro paralogs, while other regions of the replicase diverged much more profoundly . Often, such homoplasy events are driven by common substrates. Thus the identification of a common cleavage site that is processed by both PL1 pro and PL2 pro in HCoV-229E may indicate that, in this virus and probably also other coronaviruses, the conservation of overlapping substrate specificities was an important driving force of evolution. The underlying selective advantage that led to the conservation of such a partial redundancy of two proteinase domains in most coronaviruses remains to be investigated. Conservation of overlapping substrate specificities also appears to affect the cleavage site structures. Thus a comparison of PL pro cleavage sites of SARS-CoV and IBV, which both employ only one PL pro activity, with the corresponding cleavage sites of HCoV-229E, which employs two PL pro domains, revealed a much better conservation of the IBV/SARS-CoV PL2 pro sites compared with the HCoV PL1 pro /PL2 pro sites .",

In common with the prototypic picornavirus 3C proteinases (Allaire et al. 1994; Matthews et al. 1994; Mosimann et al. 1997) , coronavirus 3C-like proteinases have a chymotrypsin-like, two-bbarrel fold that is formed by 12 antiparallel b-strands (Allaire et al. 1994; Matthews et al. 1994; Mosimann et al. 1997; Anand et al. 2002 Anand et al. , 2003 . However, both the size and orientation of secondary structure elements vary considerably between the two groups of enzymes, making reliable structural alignments difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, in contrast to 3C proteinases but in common with other nidovirus 3C-like proteinases (Barrette- Ng et al. 2002; Ziebuhr et al. 2003) , coronavirus 3CL pro s have a C-terminal extension, which is called domain III to distinguish it from the b-barrel domains I and II. Domain III of the TGEV 3CL pro comprises 103 amino acids and consists of 5 a-helices that adopt a unique structure that currently has no homologs in the database (Anand et al. 2002) (Figs. 2 and 3) . The structure of the coronavirus 3CL pro domain III differs from the corresponding domain of the arterivirus nsp4 proteinase, which comprises only 49 residues and consists of 2 short pairs of b-strands and 2 a-helices (Barrette- Ng et al. 2002) .",

Thus, whereas the vast majority of picornavirus enzymes employ a catalytic triad, Cys- His-Asp(Glu) (Allaire et al. 1994; Matthews et al. 1994; Mosimann et al. 1997; Seipelt et al. 1999) , which is reminiscent of the charge-relay system of chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases, the coronavirus 3CL pro s use a catalytic dyad consisting of Cys (nucleophile) and His (general base) (Figs. 2 and 3) . Mutation analyses performed with recombinant enzymes from different coronavirus species had consistently failed to identify a third catalytic residue, suggesting that coronavirus 3CL pro s may lack a counterpart to the catalytic Asp(Glu) of other chymotrypsin-like proteinases (Liu and Brown 1995; Lu and Denison 1997; Ziebuhr et al. 1997) . This hypothesis was confirmed by crystal structure analyses of the TGEV (Anand et al. 2002) , HCoV-229E (Anand et al. 2003) , and SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzymes (PDB acc: 1Q2W). Thus, for example, in the TGEV 3CL pro structure, a buried water molecule was found in the place that is normally occupied by the third member of the triad (Asp or Glu).

Larger residues, such as Asn (which is found at the P1 0 position of all coronavirus nsp8|nsp9 sites), result in significantly reduced cleavage efficiencies (Ziebuhr and Siddell 1999; Fan et al. 2003) . Leu is strongly preferred at the P2 position of coronavirus 3CL pro substrates, although other hydrophobic residues, such as Ile, Val, Phe, and Met, are occasionally also found at this position. At the P4 position, small residues, Val, Thr, Ser, Pro, and Ala, are favored. The structural basis for the pronounced specificity of coronavirus 3CL pro s was elucidated recently by structure analysis of a hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone inhibitor bound to the active site of the TGEV 3CL pro (Anand et al. 2003) . Because the sequence of the inhibitor was derived from the P6-P1 region of a natural cleavage site (Val-Asn-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln) of TGEV 3CL pro , the structure most likely represents the binding mode of coronavirus 3CL pro substrates in general. It was found that the P region of 3CL pro substrates binds in a shallow groove at the surface of the proteinase, between domains I and II (Fig. 3) . Residues P5 to P3 form an antiparallel b-sheet with residues 164-167 of strand eII and residues 189-191 of the loop linking domains II and III. Deletion of the loop region abolishes the proteolytic activity of 3CL pro , supporting the functional significance of the interaction between the substrate and this loop region (Anand et al. 2002) .",

The neutral state of His162 over a broad pH range appears to be maintained by (1) stacking onto the phenyl ring of Phe139 and (2) accepting a hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group of the buried Tyr160. This interpretation is supported by mutagenesis data obtained for bacterially expressed HCoV-229E and feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV) 3CL pro s (Ziebuhr et al. 1997; . Tyr160 is part of the conserved coronavirus 3CL pro signature, Tyr-X-His, whereas Gly(Ala)-X-His is found at the equivalent sequence position in most 3C and 3C-like proteinases (Gorbalenya et al. 1989a; Gorbalenya and Snijder 1996) . Accordingly, stabilization of histidine in the neutral tautomeric state needs to be ensured by other residues (Bergmann et al. 1997; Mosimann et al. 1997) .",

The fact that, in the structure, the P3 side chain of the substrate analog was oriented toward bulk solvent explains why there is no specificity for any particular side chain at the P3 position of coronavirus 3CL pro cleavage sites (Ziebuhr et al. 2000) . The S4 site is rather congested (Anand et al. 2003) , explaining the conservation of small residues, such as Ser, Thr, Val, or Pro, at this position of coronavirus 3CL pro substrates. On the basis of the TGEV 3CL pro -inhibitor structure, it has been proposed that the relatively small P1 0 residues (Ser, Ala, or Gly) may be accommodated by a S1 0 subsite that involves Leu27, His41, and Thr47 (Anand et al. 2003) .",

            "text": "It is generally believed that most of the pp1a/pp1ab cleavages are mediated in trans by the fully processed form of 3CL pro (nsp5). The trans activity of 3CL pro has been well characterized, both biochemically and structurally (Ziebuhr et al. 1995; Gr\u00f6tzinger et al. 1996; Lu et al. 1996; Heusipp et al. 1997a,b; Tibbles et al. 1999; Ziebuhr and Siddell 1999; Anand et al. 2002 Anand et al. , 2003 Fan et al. 2003) . However, it is not clear whether 3CL pro cleaves itself from pp1a/pp1ab in cis or in trans. Also, it is not clear whether 3CL pro can cleave downstream pp1a/pp1ab sites in cis. Thus, on the one hand, there is biochemical and structural evidence to suggest that 3CL pro self-processing occurs in trans (Lu et al. 1996; Anand et al. 2002) . Furthermore, in MHV-infected cells, 3CL pro was found to be part of a rather stable 150-kDa processing intermediate (nsp4-10 or nsp4-11), which also argues against a rapid, cotranslational release of 3CL pro in cis (Schiller et al. 1998 ). On the other hand, a number of MHV and IBV 3CL pro -containing precursors were shown to require microsomal membranes for efficient autocatalytic release of 3CL pro from the flanking TM2 (nsp4) and TM3 (nsp6) domains (Tibbles et al. 1996; Piaeon et al. 1997) , indicating that the flanking do-mains (when properly folded) affect the activity of 3CL pro . In other words, interdomain interactions in pp1ab may modulate the structure (and activity) of the enzyme, for example, to render 3CL pro competent for cis cleavages at flanking sites or even further downstream sites. In fact, one might expect that at least some of the pp1a/pp1ab cleavages need to occur in cis early in infection, when the concentration of 3CL pro is low and intermolecular reactions are less likely to occur. Otherwise, if there were no cis cleavages at all, pp1a/pp1ab should operate initially as an extremely large polyprotein that is only processed at its N-terminus by PL pro cleavages. Structure information for larger 3CL pro precursors will be required to answer the question of whether or not 3CL pro adopts alternative conformations in its fully processed form and larger precursor molecules. Notably, reorientation of secondary structure elements after intramolecular release is believed to occur in picornavirus 3C proteinases (Khan et al. 1999) , illustrating the significance of this question.",

Both the crystal structures and dynamic light scattering data show that 3CL pro forms dimers (Anand et al. 2002 (Anand et al. , 2003 . The two molecules in the dimer are oriented perpendicular to one another (Fig. 4) . The contact interface mainly involves conserved residues of the N-terminus of one molecule and domain II of the other molecule (and vice versa). The N-terminal amino acid residues are squeezed in between domains II and III of the parent Fig. 4 . Coronavirus main proteinases form dimers (Anand et al. 2002) . Stereo representation of a Ca plot of a TGEV 3CL pro dimer (PDB accession number: 1LVO). Monomers A and B are shown in blue and red, respectively. The monomers are oriented perpendicular to one another. Dimerization mainly involves interactions of the N terminus with domain II of the other dimer (see text for details). The N termini of monomers A and B are shown in green and brown, respectively monomer and domain II of the other monomer, where they make a number of very specific interactions that appear tailor-made to bind this segment with high affinity. Apparently, this mechanism allows the active site to remain competent for binding and cleaving other sites in the polyprotein after autocleavage of 3CL pro . In addition, the exact placement of the N-terminus seems to have a structural role for the mature 3CL pro , because deletion of residues 1 to 5 leads to a dramatic decrease in proteolytic activity (Anand et al. 2003) . It has been speculated that the tight interaction of the N-terminus with domains II and III may help to maintain the loop connecting domains II and III in the orientation required to bind the P3-P5 residues of the substrate (Anand et al. 2002 (Anand et al. , 2003 . The presumed indirect role of domain III in proteolysis may explain the results from previous mutagenesis studies that consistently reported a dramatic loss of trans-cleavage activity with C-terminally truncated forms of HCoV-229E, TGEV, MHV, and IBV 3CL pro s (Lu and Denison 1997; Ziebuhr et al. 1997; Ng and Liu 2000; Anand et al. 2002) .",

Thus characterization of temperature-sensitive (ts) MHV mutants revealed that substitution of the MHV 3CL pro Phe219 residue, which is part of the loop connecting a-helices B and C in domain III (Fig. 2) , with Leu causes an RNA-minus phenotype at the restrictive temperature . Further characterization of the ts mutant, Alb ts16, showed that both plus-and minus-strand synthesis was not greatly affected when the temperature was shifted late in infection. However, when the temperature was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature early, at a time when the rate of MHV RNA synthesis increases rapidly, no increase of plus-strand synthesis was observed with Alb ts16. Furthermore, inhibition of minus-strand synthesis (by inhibition of protein synthesis) was found to cause a decline of plus-strand synthesis after 30-60 min. The data can be interpreted to indicate that the defect in 3CL pro activity interferes with minus-strand synthesis and reduces it to a low level that merely ensures the replenishment of minus strands being lost because of turnover. Alternatively, the mutation may cause a defect in the activity of 3CL pro that blocks the formation of plus-strand polymerase activity (or prevents its conversion from the minus strand-synthesizing precursor). It remains to be determined whether the observed ts phenotype is caused by specific defects in the proteolytic activity of 3CL pro or whether another, nonproteolytic function of domain III is affected. Thus, for example, protein-protein interactions involving domain III-as proposed to be mediated by the C-terminal domain of the EAV nsp4 proteinase (Barrette- Ng et al. 2002 )-may be affected.",

They utilize the energy derived from hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to unwind double-stranded (ds) RNA. Conservation of specific sequence motifs allows helicases to be classified into three large superfamilies (SFs), termed SF1, SF2, and SF3, as well as several small families (Gorbalenya et al. 1989b; Gorbalenya and Koonin 1993) .

Superimposition (stereo image) of TGEV (orange) and SARS-CoV (blue) 3CL pro s shows little variation between the structures of the N-terminal b-barrel domains I and II. The orientation (rather than the structure) of the respective C-terminal domains of TGEV and SARS-CoV 3CL pro differs slightly in the two proteins, resulting in less perfect superimposition rus helicase resides in nsp13 and has been classified as belonging to SF1 (Gorbalenya et al. 1989b, c) (Fig. 1) . Nsp13 and its homologs in other nidoviruses have a putative zinc-binding domain (ZBD) at their N-terminus (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c) , which is known to be required for the enzymatic activities of coronavirus and arterivirus helicases (Seybert, van Dinten, Posthuma, Snijder, Gorbalenya, and Ziebuhr, unpublished data) . EAV reverse genetics data have shown that the ZBD and a downstream segment (\"hinge spacer\") that links ZBD to the C-terminal helicase domain have distinct functions in arterivirus replication, sg mRNA transcription, and virion morphogenesis (van Dinten et al. 2000) . It is tempting to suggest that coronavirus helicases may have similarly diverse functions. Biochemical characterization of a recombinant form of HCoV-229E nsp13 demonstrated both nucleic acid-stimulated NTPase and duplex-unwinding activities (Seybert et al. 2000a) . Similar data have subsequently been obtained for two arterivirus nsp10 helicases and the SARS-CoV nsp13 helicase (Seybert et al. 2000b; Bautista et al. 2002; Tanner et al. 2003; Thiel et al. 2003) .",

For example, the 5 0 -to-3 0 polarity of the coronavirus nsp13 helicase activity argues against a role in the separation of secondary structures in the RNA template during minus-strand synthesis (as has been suggested for RNA viral SF2 helicases), because this would require a helicase with 3 0 -to-5 0 polarity.",

This property allows DNA-based assays to be used in the characterization of coronavirus helicases (for example, in mutagenesis studies and high-throughput tests of potential inhibitors). Because coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and the helicase has not been found to localize to the nucleus (Sims et al. 2000; Bost et al. 2001) , a biological significance of the DNA-unwinding activity of nsp13 seems unlikely, although it cannot be excluded entirely at the present stage.

The coronavirus RdRp domain comprising the finger, palm, and thumb subdomains occupies the C-terminal two-thirds of nsp12 (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c) . Recent data suggest that replication complex association of the RdRp may occur through interactions of the nsp12 segment 411-448 (located upstream of the RdRp core domain in nsp12) with ORF1a-encoded proteins, such as nsp5 (3CL pro ), nsp8, and nsp9 (Brockway et al. 2003) . Consistent with the presumed RdRp activity of nsp12, a mutation in nsp12 (His868 to Arg) was found to cause an RNA-negative phenotype in an MHV ts mutant, Alb ts22 . Thus, when infected cultures of Alb ts22 were shifted to the restrictive temperature at 40C, both plus-and minus-strand RNA synthesis ceased immediately. Even at the permissive temperature, the ts mutant synthesized 4-5 times less RNA compared with revertants. The defect of this mutant in RNA synthesis can easily be explained by the fact that His868 is part of the predicted thumb subdomain of the MHV RdRp that, in other RNA polymerases, has been implicated in polymerase activity (Burns et al. 1989; Mills et al. 1989; Plotch et al. 1989; Hansen et al. 1997) .",

An MHV ts mutant, Alb ts6, encoding a mutant form of nsp10 (Gln65 to Glu), was shown to have a defect in minus-strand RNA synthesis . Thus, when the temperature was shifted to 40C, minus-strand synthesis stopped immediately but plus-strand synthesis continued at the same level as was occurring at the time of temperature shift. Plus-strand RNA synthesis gradually declined over 3-4 h (starting at 30-60 min after the shift to 40C) because the minus strands produced at the permissive temperature were turned over and, because of the defect in their synthesis, were not replenished at the restrictive temperature.",

Peptide cleavage data have shown that, most likely because of a replacement of the conserved P2 Leu residue, the nsp10|nsp12 cleavage site is less efficiently cleaved than other SARS-CoV 3CL pro sites (Fan et al. 2003) . Also, the nsp10|nsp12 sites of other coronaviruses have the P2 position occupied by noncanonical residues. It is thus tempting to speculate that the nsp10|nsp12 site has to be cleaved more slowly than other sites, probably to attain a specific activity mediated by an nsp10-nsp12containing intermediate. The IBV nsp10 has been reported to form dimers. It localizes to membranes near the site of viral RNA synthesis (Ng and Liu 2002) .",

The viral replication complex, which consists of multiple viral but also cellular subunits (see the chapter by Shi and Lai, this volume) , is associated with these membranes and, in many cases, also directs their synthesis and/or modification (Per\u00e4nen and K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen 1991; Cho et al. 1994; Schlegel et al. 1996; Teterina et al. 1997; Snijder et al. 2001; Egger et al. 2002) . Typically, multiple vesicles or membrane invaginations (spherules) on cellular organelles are induced to which the replication complex is attached by specific structural elements, such as hydrophobic domains (van Kuppeveld et al. 1995; Snijder et al. 2001 ) amphipathic helices (Datta and Dasgupta 1994) , palmitate side chains (Laakkonen et al. 1996) , and C-terminal membrane insertion sequences (Schmidt-Mende et al. 2001) . As a result, replication takes place in a membrane-protected (and, thus, nuclease resistant) microenvironment that contains (and sequesters) the protein functions required for viral RNA synthesis. This strategy is believed to improve template specificity by retaining negative strands for template use and to repress host defenses that may be induced by double-stranded RNA (Schwartz et al. 2002) .",

            "text": "Immunofluorescence (IF) studies provided clear evidence that the vast majority of coronavirus replicase subunits localize to perinuclear membrane compartments (Heusipp et al. 1997a; Bi et al. 1998; Denison et al. 1999; Shi et al. 1999; van der Meer et al. 1999; Ziebuhr and Siddell 1999; Bost et al. 2000; Sims et al. 2000; Bost et al. 2001; Xu et al. 2001; Ng and Liu 2002) . Whereas most ORF1a-encoded replicase components remain tightly associated with membranes throughout the viral life cycle, at least some of the ORF1b-encoded subunits seem to be only temporarily present in the complex, probably when still part of the polyprotein. Thus, for example, partial detachment from the membrane-bound complexes was reported for MHV nsp12 and nsp13 later in infection Bost et al. 2001; Xu et al. 2001) . Also, the most C-terminal IBV pp1ab processing products show, in contrast to all other IBV pp1a/pp1ab proteins tested, a diffuse, cytoplasmic staining pattern in IF experiments Bost et al. 2001; Xu et al. 2001) . The membrane-bound replicase proteins overlap to a large extent with the site of viral RNA synthesis Shi et al. 1999; van der Meer et al. 1999; Bost et al. 2001; Gosert et al. 2002; Ng and Liu 2002) . There is some controversy regarding the intracellular compartment at which viral RNA synthesis takes place and, in particular, the cellular origin of the membranes employed. In a recent EM study , virus-induced double membrane vesicles (DMVs) were reported to be the site of MHV-A59 replication and transcription in HeLa-MHVR (Gallagher 1996) and 17CL-1 cells. These DMVs have a diameter of 200-350 nm and consist of a double membrane that, occasionally, is fused into a trilayer. At the time of maximum RNA synthesis, both genome-and subgenome-length positive-strand RNA was detected on DMVs by in situ hybridization, and also the results of BrUTP labeling suggest that DMVs are the site of viral RNA synthesis. The subcellular origin of the DMVs has not been determined to date. However, a previous IF study (Shi et al. 1999 ) using MHV-A59-infected 17CL-1 and HeLa-MHVR cells suggested that N-terminal pp1a/pp1ab proteins and newly synthesized RNA colocalize with ER-or Golgi-derived membranes, depending on the cell type studied.",

In IF experiments, the sites of maximum CT1a accumulation overlapped only partially with those of nsp5, nsp12, and nsp13. A thorough EM study suggested that the low (albeit significant) degree of colocalization of CT1a and nsp12 is probably due to the existence of two distinct types of membrane structures that are closely adjacent to each other but have different morphologies and protein compositions. Thus CT1a was found to be associated mainly with endosomes, whereas the majority of nsp12 was associated with multilayered membranes, probably originating from invaginations on continuous membrane sheets. The latter structures were morphologically reminiscent of endocytic carrier vesicles (ECVs) or multivesicular bodies (MVBs). However, the fact that many of these structures had membrane continuities to late endosomes argues against typical ECVs and rather favors the idea that both the multivesicular (carrying the bulk of CT1a) and multilayered (carrying the bulk of nsp12) structures represent different subdomains of the same endocytic compartment. Most intriguingly, it has also been found ) that CT1a-and nsp12-positive membranes appear to be secreted. Similar observations have also been reported recently for endosome-derived cytoplasmic vacuoles carrying the alphavirus replication complex (Kujala et al. 2001) . The functional significance of this phenomenon is currently unclear but may have parallels in the regulated lysosomal secretion systems employed by, for example, lymphocytes (Stinchcombe and Griffiths 1999) .",

The ORF1a-encoded proteins nsp2 (p65) and nsp8 (p22) cofractionated with membranes with a buoyant density of 1.05-1.09 g/ml. In contrast, nsp13, the N protein, nsp1 (p28), and newly synthesized RNA were detected in another membrane fraction of 1.12-1.13 g/ml. Both membrane fractions were LAMP-1 positive, confirming previous conclusions on the endosomal/lysosomal origin of the MHV replication compartment. Interestingly, later in infection, there appears to be a translocation of nsp13 and the N protein to the ER/cis-Golgi compartment, resulting in colocalization of these two proteins with the M protein at the site of virion assembly (Bost et al. 2001 ). The combined data suggest a multipartite structure of the coronavirus replication complex, with the N protein playing a specific role in RNA synthesis as suggested earlier (Compton et al. 1987; Baric et al. 1988 ). Apparently, the coronavirus replication complex undergoes structural rearrangements at the transition from maximum RNA synthesis to virion assembly at later time points (8-12 h p.i.). If this is confirmed, the localization of nsp13 at the site of assembly may correspond with a specific role of nsp13 in virion biogenesis. Such an activity has also been proposed for the related arterivirus nsp10 helicase (van Dinten et al. 1999 (van Dinten et al. , 2000 Seybert et al. 2000b) .",

However, it seems very likely that the strongly hydrophobic domains, TM1 to TM3 (see Fig. 1 ), that are present in nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 (Gorbalenya et al. 1989c; ) play a major role in this process. This hypothesis is supported by arterivirus data showing that homologous hydrophobic domains present in EAV nsp2 and nsp3 are necessary and sufficient to trigger the synthesis of the membrane structures carrying the arterivirus replication complex (Pedersen et al. 1999; Snijder et al. 2001) . The fact that several MHV pp1a/pp1ab processing products including nsp3 ) and nsp4-10(11) (Schiller et al. 1998) , which contain TM1 and TM2/TM3, respectively, are integral membrane proteins strongly suggests a scaffold function for these proteins. There is also biochemical evidence indicating that the majority of ORF1a-encoded proteins and, to a lesser extent, ORF1b-encoded proteins are tightly bound in the complex ). The precise protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions stabilizing this complex remain to be characterized.",

            "text": "Although much has been learned about coronavirus replicase organization, localization, proteolytic processing, and some of the viral replicative enzymes (e.g., proteinases and helicases), there are still major gaps in our knowledge. Given the availability of full-length clones of coronaviruses, directed genetic analysis is now possible (Almaz\u00b5n et al. 2000; Yount et al. 2000; Casais et al. 2001; Thiel et al. 2001a; Yount et al. 2002 Yount et al. , 2003 . In vivo studies as well as biochemical and structural information should yield important new information on the molecular details of coronaviral RNA synthesis. In this context, it will be of particular interest to define the proteins that are responsible for the unique features of coronavirus RNA synthesis, for example, the production of an extensive set of 5 0 -and 3 0 -coterminal subgenomic RNAs and the synthesis and maintenance of RNA genomes of this unique size. Studies on coronavirus replicases and their homologs on closely related viruses may also help to determine the structural and functional constraints that have driven the evolution of nidoviruses and enable them to infect a broad range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Furthermore, the relationship of the recently identified coronavirus RNA processing activities with cellular proteins may reveal interesting insights into similarities and differences (or even an interplay) between coronaviral and cellular RNA metabolism pathways. In the long term, the unique structural properties of coronavirus replicative enzymes may allow the development of very selective enzyme inhibitors and possibly even drugs suitable to combat coronavirus infections.",
