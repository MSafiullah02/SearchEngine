Given the extent of community transmission, patients no longer need a travel history to be considered for having COVID-19. 5 First responders should remain diligent even after prescreening by dispatchers. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used based on the risk of exposure (eg.,. type of activity) and the transmission dynamics of the pathogen (eg.,. contact, droplet, aerosol). 10 When no interventions are performed, paramedics providing care or who are in close proximity to the patient should wear a surgical type mask, gown, gloves, and eye protection, either goggles or a face shield. Safety glasses are not sufficient for eye protection. For aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs), paramedics should wear a N95 mask, eye protection, gloves, and fluid resistant gowns. PPE should be removed while driving the ambulance as long as the driver compartment is separate from the patient. This is important to limit contamination to the front of the ambulance. If there is no separation, the driving paramedic should wear a mask. Additionally, a mask should be provided to the patient as tolerated. 10, 11 Proper use of PPE and frequent hand sanitizing/washing is essential to prevent disease transmission in the health care setting. 1 In addition, surfaces should be disinfected frequently as the virus remains viable for extended periods of time on different materials, such as copper (4 hours), cardboard (24 hours), stainless steel (48 hours), and plastics (72 hours). 12 ",

The risk of exposure during intubation may be minimized by using the most experienced and skilled paramedic, video laryngoscopy, a bougie, and pausing chest compressions. This will provide more protection to responders as postintubation ventilation (with appropriate filter and airway cuff pressure) can limit exposure to secretions. 13 Supraglottic airways (SGAs) may offer an alternative to endotracheal intubation, which may limit exposure during placement. It is not known if SGAs reduce exposure or provide the same level of protection as intubation, but these devices should be considered when a good mask seal with BVM is difficult to achieve (e.g., transportation). There is no evidence on outcomes or specific interventions for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests related to COVID-19. Even though patients may have COVID-19, it is important to consider other pathologies of cardiac arrest. Keep a broad differential diagnosis! Paramedics should initiate resuscitation as per standard practice, and use previously validated termination of resuscitation (TOR) rules to limit transportation of nonviable patients. Application of a TOR rule will limit the time of exposure and avoid transfer of futile patients to hospital. In the event of a prolonged surge event that limits intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability, anticipate changes in your protocols that may limit the conditions under which you initiate resuscitation.",
