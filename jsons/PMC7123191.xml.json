Autologous HSCT involves collection of stem cells from the patient that are then infused back after chemotherapy. Allogenic HSCT involves infusion of stem cells from a donor.",

Pulmonary complications are the most common life-threatening complications post HSCT occurring in 30\u201360% of patients [1]. We define late onset complications are occurring 3 months after post-HSCT (Fig. 1). In this chapter, we discuss late noninfectious pulmonary complications in HSCT, and current concepts on their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. The primary focus will be on bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) which is the most common and carries the highest mortality of the late onset noninfectious complications [81]. The other late onset noninfectious complications that will be discussed include idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary venoocclusive disease, pulmonary cytolytic thrombi, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, thoracic air leak syndrome, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.",

Prophylactic azithromycin has been shown to prevent the onset of lung transplant\u2013related BOS, as well as stabilize FEVI in post-lung transplant BOS [19, 88]. However, prophylactic azithromycin has not shown to be effective in BOS post-HSCT in retrospective studies [44]. A prospective study on the prophylactic use of azithromycin to prevent airflow decline resulted in early termination secondary to hematological relapses [8]; an FDA warning was issued in August 2018 until further review (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm614085.htm).

TNF-\u03b1 may contribute to pathogenesis by direct toxicity, upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), increased leukocyte recruitment, and cell-mediated apoptosis [60]. Donor T lymphocytes secrete chemokines which further amplify the inflammatory cascade [38]. Decreased level of pulmonary surfactant has also been associated with IPS development [27, 56, 94].",

Once infections have been ruled out, systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment; IPS in association with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may require higher doses [60]. The results of other immunotherapeutic agents such as the soluble TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, etanercept, has been mixed. A retrospective single-center study over two distinct time-periods comparing steroids alone (earlier time-period) versus combined steroids and etanercept showed significant improvement in survival to hospital discharge [80]. However, the more recent use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens and improved supportive care may have accounted for this improvement. Patients with late-onset IPS who responded to etanercept have greatly improved short- and long-term mortality [79]. Results in children have been similarly promising, with complete response in 20% of patients [97]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing corticosteroids with placebo to corticosteroids with etanercept was inconclusive due to slow patient accrual and early termination [96]. Other potential therapies are under investigation. Blockade of NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor downstream of the TNF-\u03b1 receptor, has shown promise in murine models [30]. Pulmonary surfactant replacement is also being studied as an intervention to treat IPS [60].",

PFTs commonly reveal a restrictive pattern, but could be normal, obstructive, or mixed with a decreased diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) [32, 58]. High resolution chest tomographic scans in patients with OP are notable for airspace consolidations, ground glass opacities, and nodular opacities (Fig. 4) [50]. In a study of 16 patients with biopsy-proven OP post-HSCT, ground glass opacities were noted to be the most common radiological feature [63]. Bronchoalveolar lavage is useful to exclude infections. Surgical lung biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of OP, as transbronchial biopsies have lower yield; however, the latter approach may be useful in certain clinical settings [2, 64]. Histopathological features on biopsy include presence of the buds of granulation tissue which contain myofibroblasts and a loose connective tissue (Fig. 5). These buds are intra-alveolar and can extend into the bronchioles causing obstruction with associated mild interstitial inflammation [18].",

In contrast, busulfan-based or fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning compared to total body irradiation and T cell depletion regimens were associated with a lower risk [58]. The precise pathogenetic mechanisms of post-HSCT OP are unclear. The association with GVHD and increased incidence post-allogeneic HSCT suggests alloimmune-mediated lung injury.

CT scans of the chest shows peripheral pulmonary and pleural nodules [93]. Bronchoalveolar lavage is indicated to exclude infectious etiology. The diagnosis of PCT is based on surgical biopsy of the lung nodules which are characterized by vascular occlusive and hemorrhagic infarcts secondary to thrombi containing intensely basophilic amorphous material as well as entrapped leucocytes [34]. The prognosis of PCT is favorable as it responds to treatment with systemic corticosteroids. There has not been any mortality attributed to PCT in the reported literature.",

It occurs as a late onset complication of allogenic HSCT and is associated with cGVHD. According to reported literature, prevalence of TALS post allogenic HSCT is reported to be 0.83\u20135.7% with a median time range of 202\u2013575 days post HSCT [6]. The mechanism of air leak in BOS is secondary to increased intra-alveolar pressure leading to alveolar rupture into the pulmonary interstitium with subsequent retrograde dissection of air into the mediastinum and subcutaneous tissue causing pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Similarly, rupture into the pleural space causes pneumothorax [62]. CT scan of the chest is the imaging modality of choice and can detect air in the pleural space, mediastinum, and subcutaneous tissue. Infections, cough, emesis, and other causes of a similar presentation should be ruled out. Prognosis is poor with 1-year and 3-year survival of 45% and 15%, respectively [67].",

            "text": "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare complication following allogeneic HSCT and has a cumulative incidence of 1% [21]. In a study of 21,686 HSCT patients\u2019 risk factors such as unrelated or HLA mismatched donors, use of ATG or monoclonal antibodies against T cells for GVHD prophylaxis or treatment, T cell depleted donor marrow, age >50 years and second HSCT were identified. The incidence of PTLD ranged from 0.2% in patients with no risk factors to more than 8% with more than 3 risk factors [49]. The pathogenesis of post HSCT PTLD is attributed to proliferation of donor Epstein\u2013Barr Virus (EBV) infected B cells in the setting of weakened T-cell immunity. Though post HSCT is common in the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, pulmonary involvement occurs in about 20% of the cases. Median onset is around 4\u20136 months post HSCT [3]. Clinical presentation varies and could range from asymptomatic to fulminant tumor lysis syndrome. CT scans of the chest are notable for multiple pulmonary nodules with basal and peripheral predominance, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, patchy consolidation, pleural effusion, and chest wall or pleural-based masses [70]. Diagnosis may require a biopsy or could be made via noninvasive methods in the appropriate clinical setting. A probable diagnosis is made by increased EBV DNA levels in the setting of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly and when other causes have been ruled out, proven disease requires a biopsy. Treatment strategies include rituximab, reduction of immunosuppression, donor lymphocyte infusion, chemotherapy, and EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte infusions [77]. The prognosis of PTLD post HSCT is poor compared to that occurring after solid organ transplantation [62].",
