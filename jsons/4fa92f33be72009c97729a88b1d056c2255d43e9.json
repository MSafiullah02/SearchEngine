Importantly, in one case of COVID-19 in a 6 month old boy in Singapore, persistent and high SARS-CoV-2 viral load was observed despite the child being asymptomatic 2 . Viral shedding has been detected in rectal swabs of children even beyond the recovery period, suggesting that transmission through the fecal-oral route is possible 3 , a point that is likely to be of greater importance in low and middle-income countries. Being asymptomatic with high viral load, children may represent a source of community transmission of COVID-19. However, the role of children in the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.",

            "text": "It remains unknown whether children with COVID-19 have less severe illness than adults due to a combination of a lower incidence of infection, lower disease severity, or both. One hypothesis relates to the differential expression of the Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE2), the dominant binding site for SARS-CoV-2 on host cells, between children and adults. ACE2 has been suggested to be involved in the main pathophysiological pathway of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which is also the leading cause of COVID-19 mortality among adults 4 . However, differences in ACE2 expression between children and adults have not been completely established. Cytokine storms involving high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6) seem to be the pathological basis for ARDS in COVID-19. This represents a challenge for disease management as the precise biological mechanism of ARDS in COVID-19 is not well understood. It is plausible that weaker inflammatory responses in children may prolong virus survival and therefore transmission to older contacts. To this end, the results of IL-6 mAb (siltuximab) or IL-1 mAb (anakinra, canakinumab) trials and other immunotherapies are greatly anticipated. Understanding the burden of infection in children and why they do not present with severe disease will provide important clues as to how we can protect our most vulnerable populations. Research addressing this question should be a priority.",

Neutralising antibodies are important, as demonstrated by the use of convalescent sera in the treatment of critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Measurement of antibodies forms the basis of early evaluation of most COVID-19 vaccine candidates, of which there are at least 78 in development7 . The magnitude of the antibody response during COVID-19 is thought to be associated with severity, suggesting that children with mild or asymptomatic infection might produce weaker responses. If these weaker responses lead to susceptibility to reinfection, this could have profound implications for COVID-19 control. Indeed, reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 was reported in 111 recovered patients from South Korea, although the precise reason for this is an ongoing investigation8 . The WHO is preparing large-scale global serological surveys (Solidarity II Study)",
