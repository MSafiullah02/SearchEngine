            "text": "RNA helicases of the DEAD\u2010box protein family play multiple roles in almost all aspects of RNA metabolism 1, 2. They use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to unwind RNA\u2010duplex structures or remodel RNA\u2013protein complexes 1, 2. Human DDX3 is a member of the DEAD\u2010box protein family. DDX3 and its yeast homolog Ded1 have been implicated in various RNA metabolism, including transcription 3, 4, pre\u2010mRNA splicing 5, 6, 7, mRNA transport 8, 9 and translation initiation 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. The role of DDX3 in translation initiation appears to be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans 21. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Ded1 is involved in the translational control of two B\u2010type cyclins: Cig2 and Cdc13 22. Notably, Cig2 mRNA has an unusually long 5\u2032 UTR, whereas the 5\u2032 UTR of Cdc13 mRNA is predicted to contain a complex RNA secondary structure. Consistent with this notion, we found that human DDX3 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs that contain a long or structured 5\u2032 UTR in mammalian cells 13, 14, 15. Given that the RNA helicase activity of DDX3 is required for its function in translational control 13, 14, 15, we propose that DDX3 may facilitate ribosome scanning by resolving secondary structures in the 5\u2032 UTR of selected mRNAs during translation initiation.",

Recently, it has emerged that DDX3 plays a mediator role in antiviral innate immune signaling pathways 33. Viral infections are mainly detected by the host's pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll\u2010like receptors and the retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptors (RLRs), which recognize different classes of viral nucleic acids and metabolites at the surface of cells, within endosomes or in the cytoplasm 34. The sensing of viral infections through PRRs leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFN\u2010\u03b1/\u03b2), which are required for the elimination of viruses. The activation of PRRs triggers intracellular signaling cascades that in turn up\u2010regulate transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u2010\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3/7) 35. NF\u2010\u03baB controls many genes of inflammatory cytokines, whereas IRF3/7 are mainly responsible for the expression of type I IFNs.",

            "text": "Many viruses have evolved a variety of strategies to evade antiviral innate immunity, either by avoiding PRR recognition or by interfering with IFN production. For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is sensed by cytoplasmic RLRs that recognize pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the viral RNA genome 36, 37. However, most people infected with HCV eventually develop a persistent or chronic infection. HCV can circumvent the host's antiviral innate immunity via the actions of the viral NS3/4A protease 38 and the HCV core protein 30. The HCV NS3/4A protease cleaves the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to prevent signal transduction of the RIG\u2010I signaling pathway 38. The HCV core protein suppresses type I IFN induction via its interactions with STAT1 39 and DDX3 30. Similarly, vaccinia virus protein K7 and hepatitis B virus polymerase also inhibit IFN\u2010\u03b2 induction by targeting host DDX3 31, 40. The finding of DDX3 as a target of viral proteins for immune evasion highlights the importance of DDX3 in antiviral innate immunity.",

However, the cause of such multiple acts of DDX3 remains ambiguous. DDX3 has been identified as a phosphorylation target of TBK1 32. Phosphorylated DDX3 can be recruited to the IFN\u2010\u03b2 promoter, suggesting that DDX3 acts as a transcriptional regulator 32. Concurrently, DDX3 was shown to interact with IKK\u03b5 as a scaffold protein, which facilitates the phosphorylation of IRF3/7 by IKK\u03b5 and leads to IFN\u2010\u03b2 induction 29, 31. Furthermore, DDX3 interacts with MAVS 41, an adaptor triggering RIG\u2010I\u2010mediated type I IFN induction, suggesting that DDX3 acts as a sensor of viral RNAs and placed DDX3 upstream of TBK1/IKK\u03b5. However, the exact mechanism by which DDX3 participates in antiviral innate immunity is still not fully understood.",

The perturbation of PACT\u2010induced activation of RIG\u2010I by a variety of viral proteins suggests a critical role for PACT in antiviral host defense. In the present study, we show that DDX3 was required for efficient translation of PACT mRNA in human cells. Knockdown of DDX3 resulted in impaired antiviral innate immune responses. PACT partially rescued defects of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and chemokine (C\u2010C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5)/RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) induction in DDX3\u2010knockdown cells.

Among these mRNA targets of DDX3, we found that several candidates are involved in antiviral innate immunity, including PACT. To confirm whether PACT is regulated by DDX3, we examined the expression of PACT in DDX3\u2010knockdown cells and mock\u2010treated cells. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the protein level of DDX3 was significantly reduced in HeLa and HEK293 cells transduced with either of DDX3\u2010targeting shRNAs (Fig. 1A,B, lanes 2\u20133) of which shDDX3\u20102 was more effective than shDDX3\u20101 in inhibiting DDX3 expression. Cyclin E1 has been identified as a translational target of DDX3 and thus serves as a positive control 15. As observed with cyclin E1, the level of PACT protein considerably declined in DDX3\u2010knockdown cells (Fig. 1A,B), suggesting that DDX3 may control the expression of PACT protein. We also evaluated PACT and cyclin E1 protein levels in DDX3\u2010overexpressing HeLa cells. Both PACT and cyclin E1 protein levels were up\u2010regulated by DDX3 in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 1C). PACT and cyclin E1 protein levels were increased by up to four\u2010 and five\u2010fold in accordance with the levels of DDX3 overexpression in HeLa cells using \u03b1\u2010tubulin as a normalization factor (Fig. 1C). The results confirmed our notion that PACT is regulated by DDX3.",

Knockdown of DDX3 by shDDX3\u20101 and shDDX3\u20102 did not cause a detectable change in the polysome profile (Fig. 3A, top), which is consistent with the view that DDX3 is dispensable for general mRNA translation 14, 15. Accordingly, no visible change was observed in different density gradient fractions of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs (Fig. 3A, bottom).

Knockdown of DDX3 by shDDX3\u20101 and shDDX3\u20102 resulted in an accumulation of PACT and cyclin E1 mRNAs in the 40S ribosomal fraction (Fig. 3A, fraction 3), indicating a stalled translation initiation complex.

As expected, poly(I:C) induced IFN\u2010\u03b21 and CCL5/RANTES expression in a dose\u2010dependent manner, and this was impaired in DDX3\u2010knockdown HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 1\u20136). Similar results were obtained by transfection with the HCV PAMP RNA into HEK293 cells to induce IFN\u2010\u03b21 and CCL5/RANTES expression (Fig. 5A, lanes 7\u20138). To mimic bacterial infection, we also stimulated HEK293 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major constituent of the cell wall of most Gram\u2010negative bacteria. LPS\u2010induced IFN\u2010\u03b21 and CCL5/RANTES expression was also impaired in DDX3\u2010knockdown HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 9\u201310). By contrast, expression of the cytokine TNF\u2010\u03b1 was not significantly affected by DDX3 knockdown in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). This result supported a role of DDX3 in innate immunity.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the impaired IFN\u2010\u03b2 induction by the HCV core protein has not yet been fully defined. We assumed that the HCV core protein may bind to DDX3 and abrogate its function in antiviral innate immunity through translational control of PACT. To address this possibility, we examined the effects of HCV core on the translation of a reporter mRNA containing the PACT 5\u2032 UTR by a dual\u2010luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of GFP\u2010tagged HCV core, a matured form of HCV core from the HCV\u20101b genotype 51, reduced the relative Fluc/Rluc activity without changing the level of the reporter mRNAs (Fig. 6A). We also demonstrated that GFP\u2010tagged HCV core associates with endogenous DDX3 in HEK293 cells by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6B). This suggests that the HCV core protein may inhibit the translation of PACT mRNA by binding to DDX3. According to our previous study 14, DDX3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and recruited to cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) under stress conditions. We also observed that GFP\u2010tagged HCV core was mostly colocalized with DDX3 in cytoplasmic SGs (Fig. 6C), which accumulate stalled translation initiation complexes. Consistent with this notion, colocalization of GFP\u2010tagged HCV core with SG marker proteins eIF4A and HuR was observed in cytoplasmic SGs (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the HCV core protein may inhibit the function of DDX3 in antiviral innate immunity through a translational mechanism. In addition to cytoplasmic SGs, colocalization of GFP\u2010tagged HCV core with nucleolin (NCL) in the nucleolus was also observed (Fig. 6C).",

Our results indicate that the impairment of innate immunity observed in DDX3\u2010knockdown cells was likely a result of the down\u2010regulation of PACT. PACT can partially rescue the impaired innate immunity caused by DDX3 depletion (Fig. 5). In agreement with a previous study 41, we suggest that DDX3 functions in the sensing of viral infection. Many viruses have evolved various strategies for evading detection by both innate and adaptive immune responses. HCV can utilize the core protein to counteract the antiviral effects of DDX3. We provide evidence that HCV core results in a decrease in the translation of reporter mRNA containing the PACT 5\u2032 UTR (Fig. 6). The interaction between HCV core and DDX3 appears to play an important role in attenuating antiviral immune responses. The redistribution of DDX3 into cytoplasmic SGs was frequently observed in HCV core\u2010overexpressing cells (Fig. 6). Thus, the HCV core protein may inhibit DDX3 function by direct binding and/or sequestration into SGs to interfere with the expression of PACT, which is required for activation of RIG\u2010I\u2010mediated virus detection (Fig. 7). In addition to HCV core, vaccinia virus protein K7 31 and hepatitis B virus polymerase 40 proteins also abrogate IFN induction by targeting DDX3. It is likely that these viruses have developed a common strategy for evading or suppressing the host's antiviral innate immunity. Notably, PACT also serves as a target of a variety of viruses. It has been reported that viral proteins, including the influenza A virus NS1 protein 44, the Ebola virus VP35 protein 43, 46, the herpes simplex virus US11 protein 45 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 4a protein 47, can abrogate RIG\u2010I\u2010mediated IFN induction by direct interaction with the PACT. By contrast, DDX3\u2010mediated translational control of PACT expression is a novel strategy for counteracting antiviral innate immunity.",

RNAi also plays an antiviral role in infected plants 57, invertebrates 58 and mammals 59. Dicer requires PACT to facilitate substrate specificity during small interfering RNA and microRNA biogenesis.
