South Korea is one of the countries that suffer from the outbreak of COVID-19 in the next order after China, and has started to take action since mid-February. The Keimyung University Dong-San Medical Center (DSMC), where the authors are working at, is responsible for areas where approximately 77% of South Korea\u2019s COVID-19 patients have occurred! [1] The medical staff in charge are suffering from depression and exhaustion due to the concerns about infection, stress from quarantine, physical fatigue caused by protective equipment, and manpower problem. In addition, there was a COVID-19 patient deceased last week after a seizure for hours, and there is a COVID-19 patient with a major stroke in the ICU. It is not known whether this is caused by COVID-19 per se or by a systemic condition worsened by COVID-19; however, it is clear that the detection was delayed and treatment was limited due to the circumstances under the policy against COVID-19. The slogan, Time is Brain, stands for neurological emergencies such as stroke, and status epilepticus [2, 3]. The authors have pondered the role of the neurologists and noticed several obstacles in timely detection and treatment of neurological emergencies under the policy for COVID-19.",

The need for any medical staff to acknowledge neurological emergencies cannot be stressed too much. Such an acknowledgement requires not as much as a well-trained neurologist, but even an ordinary medical staff\u2019s due diligence would often suffice. It would be enough to examine the patient, suspect a neurological emergency, and order a neuroimaging or electroencephalography.",

From time to time, check and mobilize the medical personnel and strategies that are available. How and who will carry out endovascular revascularization therapy? Is portable electroencephalography available? It is necessary to check the ready-made pathways for patients with a neurological problem. That is what neurologists should do.",
