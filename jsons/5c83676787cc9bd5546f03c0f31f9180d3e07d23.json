One of the most important tasks of pediatricians has always been the management of patients with communicable diseases. The main reason for this is the higher frequency of infectious diseases in infants and young children compared to older children and adults due to the limited adaptive immunity repertoire and thus increased susceptibility to common pathogens. Therefore, pediatricians are considerably involved in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. In consequence, every pediatrician must be considered also an infectious disease specialist. This, in turn, has been a downside for the development of pediatric infectious diseases as a medical discipline recognized on its own in many countries. Nevertheless, the multiple technical advances in the recent years have led to substantially improved prevention and treatment success rates in many pediatric disciplines, and a plethora of these success rates are linked to the integral role of pediatric infectious disease specialists providing profound knowledge, expertise and quality assurance. Accordingly, pediatric infectious disease specialists nowadays play a pivotal role both for community pediatrics and for clinical pediatrics in highly specialized medical centers.",

The four disciplines microbiology, epidemiology, immunology, and pharmacology build up the essential basis for both pediatric and adult infectious disease specialists. Nevertheless, despite several overlaps that are beneficial for constructive professional interactions, the position of the pediatric infectious disease specialists differ from those of specialists for adult infectious diseases. These differ not only in relation to the basic training in pediatrics and internal medicine, respectively, but also in relation to distinct focuses in the clinics obviously mandated by many age-related uniqueness of patients in the pediatric age (Tab. 1). Etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, management and prevention of infectious diseases in children may substantially differ from those in adults.",

            "text": "One important example of the uniqueness of pediatric infectious diseases is the need to deal with infections in newborns. Newborns have distinct pathophysiological characteristics, which mainly relate to the immature immune system. Another example of uniqueness comes from the age-related and more frequent contacts to potential infectious sources or index cases in nurseries, day-care centers or schools. These contacts lead to increased risks to preferentially acquire respiratory or gastrointestinal infections. Similar reasons account for higher frequency of outbreaks of infectious diseases in children compared to adults. Infants and toddlers are often the source of infections within a household, for health care workers or medical personnel as well as for nursery employees and teachers. Infections represent the reason for up to 60% of the hospitalization of children. Etiological diagnosis of these infections may be hampered by the limited volumes of biological samples including blood or cerebrospinal fluid available from young children, often affording rather judicious, and to this-age-group-adapted, diagnostic approaches. Moreover, most of the hospitalized children are prescribed one or more antibiotics [1] . In this context it needs to be underscored that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial substances are rather different in children compared to adults. This may afford the use of distinct preparations or dosages in children. In addition, pharmacology and toxicology of antimicrobial drugs in newborns and specifically in preterm or small-for-date babies are rather special. Accordingly, in pediatrics special knowledge in the distinct uniqueness of newborns and other age groups, other disciplines and on nosocomial infections in neonatal and pediatric nurseries and intensive care units is warranted. Finally, vaccinations make up a larger proportion of the preventive measures in pediatrics than in adult medicine, and this is mirrored by the extraordinary success of general immunization campaigns in children [2] .",

Obvious examples are consultations for patients with underlying conditions including congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, primary or secondary immunodeficiencies such as due to HIV infection or iatrogenic immunosuppression following allograft transplantation, or tumors. Many of these patients nowadays survive beyond the pediatric age and need to undergo the difficult process of transition to medical care for adults [7] . Thus, close interactions with colleagues from adult medicine taking over the care of these patients before, during and after the transition process are indispensable to ensure satisfaction and compliance of the patients with often heavy burdens in addition to the burdens of adolescence. Infectious disease specialists have a considerable number of skills at their disposal [8] . Experienced infectious disease specialists, for example, often reduce the use of expensive diagnostic measures even in the most complex patient situations, apply intravenous antimicrobial treatment also to outpatients and switch from intravenous to apt oral medication on time. Hence, infectious disease specialists increase the satisfaction of patients while ensuring management quality at lowest possible expenses.",

Most importantly, mother-to-child transmission rates in these countries have fallen from around 15-25% to below 2%, and where preventive measures are strictly applied, vertical transmission of HIV has virtually vanished [10] . This success story, however, evolved at the expense of intrauterine and neonatal exposure to drugs with a considerable toxic potential [11] . Thus, pediatric infectious disease specialists need to conduct long-term surveys on the evolution of these children following exposure to antiretrovi-ral drugs in a life period with highest vulnerability, especially of the central nervous system.

The goal to eradicate poliomyelitis, however, seems to be hurdled by unprecedented reemergence of poliomyelitis due to \"escape\" variants [14] or due to outbreaks in communities reluctant to vaccination, mainly for religious reasons and in countries where there are governmental obstacles to vaccination campaigns [13] . The tasks waiting the pediatric infectious disease specialists are to promote vaccination at the individual, at the community and at the country levels. This will demand persuasion activities focusing on individuals and on politicians. Similarly, measles, rubella and mumps are three viruses against which we possess excellent vaccines, and thus could be eliminated given that the only host for these viruses is humans. We will eventually defeat theses viruses only if pediatric infectious disease specialists succeed in convincing parents of the necessity of vaccination. Many parents are no longer familiar with the disastrous consequences of these viruses simply because of the decreased circulation of these viruses in the populations due to the fact that a large proportion has been previously vaccinated.

More recently, conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis type C have also been introduced in general vaccination programs, and it appears that we will again witness a success. Nevertheless, not all S. pneumoniae serotypes are represented in the vaccine and the serotypes against which the vaccine elicits immunity may be replaced by other serotypes. Furthermore, a universal vaccine against N. meningitidis type B is still lacking. Thus, the reduction of S. pneumoniae or N. meningitidis-induced disease will not be as impressive as for H. influenzae type b. In consequence, pediatric infectious disease specialists will have to explore modalities to improve surveillance and treatment of these prominent and potentially deadly bacterial infections. It goes without saying that more research on the elucidation of bacterial and host-related pathogenetic mechanisms is needed to cut the imminent danger from these pathogens [17] [18] [19] .",

Another unprecedented observation was the increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the reemergence of previously eradicated pathogens as agents of bioterror. Among the most feared and serious antibiotic-resistant bacteria are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Multiple antibiotic resistances are a problem also with S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [9] . A main challenge for pediatric infectious disease specialists in addition to the challenge faced by their adult counterparts in this context will be the availability of apt antimicrobials in apt formulations.

In recent years, many obstacles in the engineering of vaccines have been overcome. Using \"reverse vaccinology\" [20] , a process in which computer analysis, microarrays, proteomics and other genome-based systematic approaches are used to select genomic sequences of microorganisms, antigens likely to confer protective immunity can be identified. Candidate antigens can be expressed by recombinant DNA and be tested in animal models. Reverse vaccinology has enabled the production of vaccines against HCV, human papillomaviruses, and meningococci type B. These examples will be followed for other pathogens representing a threat to infants and children.",

Most vaccines available today work by inducing antibodies, and quantification of these antibodies is often used as a parameter for immunogenicity of and protection by a given vaccine. Unfortunately, protective antibody levels are not clearly defined for every available vaccine. Moreover, as in the example of HBV vaccine, the levels of specific antibodies may not be indicative for the status of protection. The level of specific antibodies may be below the limit of detection but vaccinated individuals may be still protected against HBV infection by the cellular immune responses. The effective stimulation of cytotoxic T cells can be obtained using engineered non-replicating viral vectors, such as modified vaccinia virus, replication-incompetent adenoviruses and DNA vaccines [9] .",

Toll-like receptors and NOD proteins are involved in this process. An improved knowledge of the pathways of innate immunity, their selectivity and their interactions is likely to improve the efficacy of vaccines, since certain compounds triggering innate immune defenses, e.g., unmethylated CpG, which mimics microbial DNA or lipopolysaccharide as a bacterial cell wall component, could be used as novel vaccine adjuvants to enhance immunity.
