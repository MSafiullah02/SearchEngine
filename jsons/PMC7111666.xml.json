The three domains approach offers a model to make sense of both the scale of the agenda and the relative contributions of groupings to the practice of public health. It establishes the boundaries of the field for which the competencies achieved through training and education can be applied to a framework based on the historical origins of public health. The Welsh Assembly Government and the National Public Health Service in Wales use the framework explicitly in strategic commissioning and providing public health services. Thus, the three domains approach could ground teaching practice, enabling the assimilation of new thinking into the curriculum. In itself, however, it does not validate the required competencies. To validate the importance of what is included in an MPH course, it is necessary to consider what graduates do, the challenges they face and the mix of skills they require in practice settings.15, 45 As the National Public Health Partnership in Australia noted, any conceptualization of the core functions of public health needs to be relevant to the \u2018total public health effort and not just to those activities which government public health authorities are responsible for carrying out or funding\u2019.1\n",

The value of this to those seeking FPH membership would be considerable and may make the courses more attractive and sustainable.

Whilst there is literature available that provides a framework to match a curriculum to practice development,50 it has not previously been applied to public health. Applying the model to the findings from this study suggests that competency in relation to public health is relatively well defined. However, as public health itself is less well defined and delineated,49 the reference points that are informing the competencies and which would inform both practice and curriculum development to support practice would need some further study to ensure that the maximal potential of the evidence base is achieved and reflected within a curriculum. Ensuring that the perspective of practitioners, specialists and their employing agencies are reflected adequately within the framework will be key to achieving this goal.45\n",

Models that incorporate competency-based learning within a more explicitly realized visualization of the delivery environment may better support students\u2019 future learning and adaptability to the workplace by enabling students to take a systemized approach to their learning, which is more responsive to the changing political and practical agendas. The three domains model, which has been found to be operationally robust in the UK and is endorsed by the FPH, its specialist body, could be easily adapted for use by providers of public health education, as evidenced by the UK and Hong Kong case studies.",
