While AhR canonical signaling has been identified as a primary mediator of biological responsiveness to environmental chemicals, alternative signaling events are increasingly being understood to mediate the physiological effects of AhR (Khazaal et al., 2018). AhR is a cytosolic signal sensor and transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus upon binding to planar aromatic hydrocarbons. In addition, AhR signaling is intricately involved in fine-tuning distinct immune responses, particularly at environmental interfaces where endogenous and exogenous AhR ligands accumulate (Quintana et al., 2008). For example, AhR activity has been documented to be a key determinant of T helper (Th) cell differentiation. Notably, ligands with differential AhR agonist activity may have opposing effects on Th cell differentiation, demonstrating the finely tuned regulation of this transcription factor at the ligand-binding level (Quintana et al., 2008).",

Exogenous AhR ligands include environmental toxic stimuli (e.g., dioxin), bacterial metabolites, or naturally occurring ligands, such as dietary ligands (e.g., flavonoids and glucosinolates), abundantly found in plants (McIntosh et al., 2010). Starting from infancy, AhR levels in hepatic, lung, and thymic cytosol slowly decline with age. Thus, while innate immune cells in children have high expression of AhR, immune cells in adults have conservative to low AhR expression (Esser and Rannug, 2015), representing a potential important highlighted finding in COVID-19 prevalence in adults.",

Additionally, cytosolic AhR and NF-kB regulate calcium-related genes, increasing rapidly the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations that drive cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology. This sequence leads to downstream pro-inflammatory responses mediated by c-src, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and C\u2013C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CCL1) (N'Diaye et al., 2006; Peterson et al., 2018).

This part of the respiratory system, however, is vulnerable to the effects of very fine particulate matter (especially matter with a diameter less than 2.5 \u03bcm, which is mainly produced by diesel engines, charcoal-burning, wood-burning, and industrial exhausts). This vulnerability is because particles of this size are able to bypass the protective mechanisms of the respiratory tract and accumulate in the alveolar tissue. If the particles are less than 0.1 \u03bcm, they can penetrate completely the alveolar cell membrane and enter the bloodstream. However, airborne particulate matter may act as AhR activators and thus trigger immune responses (van Voorhis et al., 2013).",

Furthermore, COPD has also been associated with an abnormal pulmonary and systemic immune response to tobacco smoking, although only the so-called \u201csusceptible smokers\u201d develop the disease (Cruz et al., 2019). Smokers and COPD patients are subpopulations with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, likely because of the enhanced airway expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, the entry receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in lower airways (Leung et al., 2020). Thus, many COVID-19 patients with COPD develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to pulmonary edema and lung failure. They also have liver, heart, and kidney damage, reflecting acute systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome and further multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Docea et al., 2020).",

The AhR is a known modulator of antiviral pulmonary immunity. AhR activation by TCDD has been shown to decrease survival after infection with a nonlethal dose of influenza A virus, concomitant with doubling of pulmonary neutrophil influx and suppression of expansion and differentiation of virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells (Vorderstrasse et al., 2003). Thus, exposure to environmentally-derived AhR activators is associated with increased respiratory infections such as bronchial asthma and COPD (Roca et al., 2013).

Smoking, biomass burning, air pollution, and inhalation of fine dust are contributing factors to COPD and atmospheric particulate matter \u2014a known carrier of AhR ligands\u2014 can aggravate COPD (Roca et al., 2013).

All these parameters are sensitive to toxic environmental exposures, especially in the adult immune system.

These adverse effects could extend to following generations through epigenetic inheritance, thus weakening future generations\u2019 bodily defenses against infections (Vassilopoulou et al., 2017). The increased risk for injury to the developing immune system has been shown across several categories of drugs, chemicals, as well as heavy metals, some metalloids and mold toxins, through perinatal genome reprogramming, increasing the risk for adverse immune outcomes persisting into later life (Vassilopoulou et al., 2017). In particular, exposure to AhR agonists may cause persistent changes to immune responses that can affect subsequent generations, meaning that the environment of prior generations shapes susceptibility to pathogens and antiviral immunity in later generations (Post et al., 2019).",

NMs-induced immune activation may increase the incidence of allergic reactions, inflammatory responses, or autoimmunity. Additionally, NMs-induced suppression may reduce maturation and proliferation of immune cells, resulting in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases or tumor growth.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family that has a single-stranded RNA genome of positive sense. This gene encodes four structural proteins, namely spike glycoprotein (S), a small envelope protein (E), matrix glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Li et al., 2020). The entry of the virus into cells is mediated by the S protein, in particular by attaching its surface unit (S2) to ACE2, an enzyme present in primarily type II pneumocytes (lung alveolar epithelial cells). Then the S protein is cleaved by cellular proteases and the viral capside is fused with the cellular membrane, thus allowing intracellular translocation of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with ACE2 by endocytosis (Cava et al., 2020). This is followed by massive intracellular replication of SARS-CoV-2, which then undergoes exocytosis where it binds again to ACE2, thus entering into a vicious cycle (Abassi et al., 2020) Furthermore, after endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex, surface ACE2 is down-regulated, resulting in unopposed angiotensin II accumulation (Vaduganathan et al., 2020). The binding affinity of specific receptor binding of S protein is related to virus infectivity and pathogenicity (Li et al., 2020https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7093363)). In this regard, ACE2 genetic polymorphisms and expression levels in different tissues might alter host susceptibility to COVID-19 by affecting the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.",

Hence, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 neutralizes the advantageous physiological effects of this enzyme. Attenuation of ACE2 catalytic function alters RAAS system activity, resulting in enhanced inflammation and vascular permeability observed in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease, eventually leading to acute lung injury and adult respiratory distress syndrome as observed in patients with severe COVID-19 (Cheng et al., 2020 27). Hence, local activation of the RAAS may mediate lung injury responses to viral insults (Vaduganathan et al., 2020). Indeed, when angiotensin I and angiotensin II receptors (AT1R and AT2R, respectively) are activated, they lead to the increased expression of proinflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-6), triggering an inflammatory process in the lungs and other organs. In particular, AT1R activates the transcription factors NF-kB and activator protein 1 (AP-1), which in turn increases cytokine expression, apoptosis, vasoconstriction, fibroproliferation, retention of Na+, and the enhancement of lung injury. The endogenous angiotensin II inhibits alveolar fluid clearance and dysregulates epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) expression via AT1R, contributing to alveolar filling and pulmonary edema (Cava et al., 2020).",

These considerations have led to speculation that ACE inhibitors and ARBs might be harmful in patients with Covid-19. However, a number of studies conducted in different populations and with different designs have come to the conclusion that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are unlikely to be harmful in patients with Covid-19 (Jarcho et al., 2020 1). Conversely, because of the protective effects of ACE2 on acute lung injury and chronic diseases, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity might be an approach for the treatment of COVID-19 (Cheng et al., 2020 27). The aforementioned speculations should not be regarded as evidence to prescribe or not these drugs in patients with Covid-19. Clearly, randomized clinical trials are warranted to shed light on this apparent paradox.",

TLR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of airway disease resulting from respiratory virus infections, with TLR signaling leading to the activation of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IFN-\u03b3, and CCL5), and interferon-stimulated genes (Totura et al., 2015). The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the TLR activates the its downstream signaling pathway, causing the release of pro-IL-1\u03b2 (which is cleaved by caspase-1). This is followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1\u03b2, which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis (Conti et al., 2020).",

            "text": "In addition, given that SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells is mainly mediated by the endocytic pathway, chloroquine seems effective in blocking endocytosis and/or inducing viral entrapment into the lysosome. The latter can be achieved by neutralizing the endosomal pH, thus favoring virus\u2013endosome fusion, inhibit lysosomal protease activity, and prevent the cleavage of S protein and therefore viral entry into the host cell (Yang et al., 2004). Chloroquine may also thwart viral protein maturation, block the recognition of viral antigens by dendritic cells, and increase cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell activity to viral antigens. In addition, it blocks phosphorylation (activation) of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and caspase-1 (Steiz et al., 2003) in THP-1 cells, both of which are required for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses replication (Briant et al., 1998). Moreover, chloroquine affects immune system activity by mediating an anti-inflammatory response, which might reduce damage due to the cytokine storm. Chloroquine inhibits IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells, reduces IL-1\u03b2 release, IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines in monocytes/macrophages, and IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12 gene expression (Devaux et al., 2020). Lysosomotropic agents, ammonia chloride and bafilomycin A, have been found to reduce the transduction on 293/hACE2 cells by SARS-CoV-2 S, and thus inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells through endocytosis (Villamil Giraldo et al., 2014; Ou et al., 2020).",

Its clinical significance was proved during the West African Ebola virus epidemic of 2013\u20132016 and the Kivu Ebola epidemic in 2018 (Warren et al., 2015). Given its promising effectiveness against previous corona-viruses, Remdesivir has also been tested against COVID-19. According to various studies, favorable outcome is to be expected from animal use given the in-vitro efficiency of the drug (Wang et al., 2020). Although Remdesivir has led to quick recoveries in symptoms of Covid-19 patients in a clinical trial, results from its Phase III trial involving severe Covid-19 patients are expected to be available soon.",

Although quarantine may reduce the spread of the virus, it may impose the self-medication at home for chronic diseases without medical diagnosis and treatment, increase the risk of adverse complications of cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and psychiatric diseases, shifting thus the health cost from public providers to patients. Scientists in fields of public policy have presented combined tactical and strategic treatment approaches that aimed at preventing and reversing COVID-19 and other diseases, including treatment repurposing as well. Optimally, the tactical and strategic approach components would be implemented in parallel, to provide benefit from the synergies of the combined approach This combined approach would allow the vulnerable to survive the near-term potentially lethal effects of SARS-CoV-2 exposure through tactical treatments, and would allow the most vulnerable and the larger population to be more resistant to future viral attacks of all types through strategic treatments (Kostoff, 2020).",

Interestingly, older adults exhibit a decline in immune function -known as immunosenescence-resulting in increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and a higher risk of serious complications than younger people, reflecting altered acquired and innate immunity (Crooke et al., 2019). Aging is associated with altered T cell function, decreased thymic output and thymic involution, and reduced numbers of naive T cells (Berzins et al., 2002) and micronutrient deficiencies. All these elements play key roles in increasing inflammation and its resulting morbidity and mortality (Salanitro et al., 2012). Immune function may be improved in immune competent adults, particularly those over 65 years old, by restoring deficient micronutrients, such as vitamins A, C, D, E, B2, B6, and B12, folic acid, iron, selenium, and zinc to optimal (Maggini et al., 2018). Adequate intake and bodily levels of these micronutrients has been shown to be critical in reducing risks stemming from inflammatory and non-communicable diseases (Miles et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Nutritional modulation of the immune system is also associated with reduction or delayed onset of immune-mediated chronic diseases. Several micronutrients and dietary components have been shown to play specific roles in the development and maintenance of an effective immune system. For example, arginine is necessary for the nitric oxide generation by macrophages, and vitamin A and zinc are known regulators of cell division. Vitamin E is both an antioxidant (Lee and Han, 2018) and protein kinase C activity inhibitor (Childs et al., 2019). Dietary and supplementation interventions enriching the gut microbiome, such as the use of probiotics and prebiotics (Hill et al., 2014), may be needed to help enhancing or restoring a healthy gut microbiome. In addition, diets lacking vegetables may decrease the diversity of nutrients reaching the gut microbiome. This in turn alters epithelial integrity resulting in increased permeability or \u2018leaky gut\u2019, allowing immune cells within the gut-associated lymphoid tissue to be directly exposed to intraluminal nutrients or elements of the gut microbiota. A great example of altered gut permeability induced by micronutrient status is that of vitamin D. Specifically, vitamin D-deficient diets are found to be responsible for increased epithelial permeability due to dysfunctioning tight junctions, resulting in both acute and chronic gut inflammation (Bischoff et al., 2014; Sassi et al., 2018). Optimal probiotic bacterial composition has been shown to effectively reduce inflammation, characterized by reduction of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokines, such as IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3, and concomitant increases in the levels of inflammation-resolving cytokine, such as IL-10 (Santiago-Lopez et al., 2018). On the other hand, prebiotics can be used not only as substrates for bacterial metabolism but also to enhance barrier function. The unparalleled importance of natural and well-balanced diets has been also highlighted vis-\u00e0-vis infant formula consumptions. It is well established that breastfeeding affords passive immunity to the infant via transfer of antibodies, growth factors, and cytokines to the offspring (Torres-Castro et al., 2018; Plaza-Diaz et al., 2018). Breastmilk is also enriched with microbiota thatpromote the maturation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Donovan and Comstock, 2016), playing a key role in development of the immune system during thymus maturation, particularly for T cell function. In breastfed infants, complementary feeding with prebiotics for optimal microbiome maintenance has been proposed (McKeen et al., 2019).",

Although activation of TLR4 by LPS may cause inflammatory response, a number of nutrients, such as long-chain omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to thwart TLR4 activation, thus attenuating inflammation (Rogero and Calder, 2018). In contrast, a Mediterranean-type diet, which is rich in certain foods (vegetables, fruit, nuts, legumes, fish, \u2018healthy\u2019 dietary fats such as virgin olive oil), has been shown to be associated with lower risk for chronic diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders (Dinu et al., 2018). These effects have been attributed to immune-modulation and the anti-inflammatory properties of various polyphenols and other bioactive compounds inherent to these foods, especially fruits and vegetables (Yahfoufi et al., 2018). \u039dutrients from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) affect the adaptive immune response because the cellular ability for specific recognition of a genetically modified protein is lacking. There is no \u2018memory\u2019 on repeated exposure, resulting in allergic reactions observed in consumers after consuming modified plants. One example is the \u201cStarlink\u201d maize, which was engineered with genetic information from Bacillus thuringiensis to increase the plant's resistance to various insects (Nawaz et al., 2019; Tsatsakis et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016). Except for xenobiotic and GMOs allergenicity, there are genetic hazards arising from the inserted gene, its expressed protein per se, and secondary or pleiotropic effects on other gene expression. This results in disruption of natural genes in the manipulated organism (Bawa and Anilakumar, 2013).",

It seems likely that a spike mutation, which probably occurred in late November 2019, triggered transmission of the virus to humans (Cascella et al., 2020). \u03a4he current anti- SARS-CoV-2 therapies used in some patients have been unable to counteract disease progression and to save patients\u2019 lives. Since the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved, it could be a target for antiviral (anti-S2) drugs; however, the potential for viral mutations may be responsible for future disease relapses (Cascella et al., 2020). In this study, we emphasize that in addition to the urgent measures that are necessary to interrupt the coronavirus transmission from farming animals to humans, there is also a need to improve the current global strategy for energy management and other factors that may adversely affect the immune system of the human, and thereby increase the risk of both infectious and chronic-degenerative diseases. Exposures to large classes of xenobiotics have a triple impact on the immune system. First, xenobiotics promote immunomodulatory effects in immune cells. Second, xenobiotics increase the range of immunotoxicity of human-associated micro-organisms or new viral and microbial attacks. Third, xenobiotics may reduce vaccine efficacy.",

Given the guidance of the health authorities to transfer COVID-19 patients into hospitals only when presenting fever and dyspnea, it appears that for all admitted patients, and especially for ICU patients, the inflammosome is already at an advanced stage precluding effective treatment. Accordingly, novel AhR-mediated immunotherapies for a plethora of immune-associated diseases/disorders should be pursued.",
