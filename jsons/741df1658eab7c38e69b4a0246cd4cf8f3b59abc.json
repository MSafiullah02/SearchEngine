Initially the disease was associated with exposure in a seafood and wild animal market, but then transmission from person to person was confirmed.

On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the name of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), having as main symptoms in the acute phase of the disease fever, cough, myalgia and dyspnea. On the same day, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named this new coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). WHO technical visit carried out between 16 and 24 February estimated the R0 basic number of reproduction cases of the then new coronavirus initially between 2-2.5 [2] . Even before WHO recognized that the occurrence of the coronavirus was a pandemic (March 11), the virus had already spread to many countries. By the end of April, more than 3.6 million cases and 251.5 thousand deaths had been registered on the five continents. [2] . In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on February 26, 2020. After 15 days, sustained transmission was declared and on March 17, the first death was confirmed. By the end of April 2020, more than 110 thousand cases and 5,000 deaths had been confirmed, with a mortality coefficient of 20 deaths per 1 million inhabitants, with Brazil among the 10 countries with the highest number of deaths.

In Brazilian law, the definition of the cause of death in the death certificate is preferably made by the attending physician and there is no obligation for the diagnostic hypothesis to have laboratory confirmation. Therefore, we group deaths as respiratory causes (COVID-19, pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome) and all causes (including previous and more septicemia, other deaths and undetermined causes).",

Table 1 shows the population and the epidemiological situation of the cities studied. We also present an excess of deaths from all causes during the period classified as excess mortality. We can observe different incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants, the lowest being 3.3 in Porto Alegre and the highest 229.2 in Recife. The case fatality rate varied between 3.3% in Porto Alegre, the highest rate was Manaus, 10.2%. Figure 2 shows that, with the exception of Porto Alegre, in the 5 cities with the highest incidence of COVID-19, excess mortality was identified. In the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro there was an increase above 95% of the confidence interval in general mortality from the epidemiological week 11 when compared to the previous year. In these cities, the first cases confirmed by laboratory diagnosis occurred respectively in epidemiological weeks 12 and 13. These findings suggest that there may have been underreporting of cases and deaths by COVID-19 for epidemiological surveillance, but that it can be identified by the syndromic surveillance of excess deaths. In the cities of Recife, Fortaleza and Manaus the excess of deaths can be identified from week 14. In Manaus, the risk of dying in SE 17 from respiratory disease was 11 times greater than in the same period of the previous year, considering all causes of deaths the increase was 4 times. Assuming that week 17 probably still does not include all deaths, these numbers are expected to be even higher. In figure 3 -A we can see the strong Pearson correlation (r = 0.95) between the number of confirmed deaths in SINAN and the excess of deaths up to epidemiological week 16, in the six cities studied. The slope of the regression suggests that there was an excess of deaths 2.5 times greater than the official number of deaths reported in week 16 (R\u00b2=0.91; p<0.0001).",

Considering that the data were collected 14 days after the end of week 16, we believe that almost all investigations of deaths should have been closed. Therefore, we can estimate that the epidemiological surveillance system only 52% of the total mortality burden of this disease. This is not an unexpected finding, since other viruses such as influenza and chikungunya are also characterized by a mortality burden that is often greater than that measured through the etiological investigation of each patient. Mortality associated with these viruses can be better assessed by calculating the excess mortality that occurs in periods of epidemic [13, 14] . Using a similar methodology, it is possible to estimate that in New York City the excess of deaths in the first four weeks was 12547 and, however, conventional epidemiological surveillance was able to identify 7186 deaths from COVID-19, 57% of the excess deaths in the same period [15] . In Portugal the excess of mortality that occurred between March 1 and April 22 was 3 to 5 times higher than that explained by the deaths reported by COVID-19 officially reported [16] . This underestimation of mortality through surveillance systems can occur as a result of several factors, part of which is explained by failure to report, another part of the difficulty in identifying cases that present in atypical ways and the late complications of the disease. The underestimation of mortality by surveillance systems can occur as a result of several associated factors, part of which is explained by failure in the notification or laboratory investigation of patients who would have a case definition criterion, another part is a consequence of the difficulty in identifying the cases that present atypical clinical forms or deaths from late complications of the disease. In fact, a still unknown proportion of patients with COVID-19 have serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular complications such as acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock, these cases may not be identified by attending physicians in routine situations.

COVID-19 is characterized by a majority of mild cases that can be confused clinically with influenza, or even with respiratory syncytial virus that occurs at this time of year in these two Brazilian cities [18] . Therefore, it is plausible to believe that SARS-CoV-2 has circulated widely and this circulation was not identified at the beginning of the Brazilian epidemic. As patients with COVID-19 worsen around the 10th day of symptom and death often occurs 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, there may have been an important transmission even before the first case was identified. The County of Santa Clara Medical Examiner-Coroner identified SARS-CoV-2 at the autopsy of a patient who died at home because of an unknown cause on February 6 with no history of travel abroad. The first case of community transmission in the USA was identified by regular epidemiological surveillance on February 26 [19] . During the 2009 influenza pandemic in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, it was possible to identify that mortality from respiratory diseases in the population was already above the upper limit of 95% of the expected two weeks before confirmation of community viral circulation in the State [13] . These findings reinforce the sensitivity and usefulness of surveillance of excess deaths and other complementary strategies of traditional epidemiological surveillance based on the notification and investigation of suspected clinical cases.",

This choice was due to the fact that the SIM takes at least 6 months to consolidate the information and free access for consultations. We emphasize that this limitation is restricted to the analysis of the excess of deaths from respiratory causes, since the cause of death does not interfere in the assessment of mortality from all causes. Another limitation related to the use of data from the registry offices is that in this system only data are available for the years 2019 and 2020, therefore, it was not possible to use an average mortality rate of several years as would be the most appropriate [14, 15] . Even with these limitations, the results were quite consistent, showing the most affected ages and there was a strong correlation between the mortality found in the official surveillance system and excess mortality, in addition, the period of increase in mortality was coincident with the pandemic. In addition, no excess deaths were identified in the city with a low incidence of COVID-19.",

Most countries already have mortality systems that could easily be adapted for this purpose. An important characteristic of this approach is that it does not depend on the flow of investigation of cases by health professionals, who are involved in preparedness and response activities during major epidemics. Because it does not necessarily depend on laboratory research, surveillance of excess mortality can be very useful, especially in low-income countries. In addition, it does not depend on the initial clinical suspicion, being able to more sensibly identify all deaths associated with the occurrence of different atypical phenomena, as diverse as epidemics, extreme weather events or earthquakes. .
