Two real-time PCR assays, targeting the non-structural protein (NP-1) and viral protein (VP-1) genes, were designed and validated to detect HBoV in patients with respiratory disease, gastroenteritis, or systemic illness. Sensitivity of the NP-1 and VP-1 assays were equal to the conventional PCR assay previously described by Allander et al. [2005: Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 12891-12896] being 100%, and giving specificity of 94% and 93%, respectively. There was no cross-reaction identified with unrelated respiratory agents, or to human DNA. The limits of detection were 10 copies of genomic DNA equivalents per reaction for both assays. The assays were used to screen three different sample populations, combined nose, and throat swabs (n \u00bc 96) from children with acute respiratory disease, fecal samples (n \u00bc 375) from adults, and children with gastroenteritis and whole blood (n \u00bc 229) collected from 31 immunocompromised children taken over an 18-month period. In total 17 (18%) respiratory samples and 18 (4.8%) fecal samples were identified as having HBoV present. Of the pediatric whole blood specimens investigated, HBoV was detected in six (2.6%) samples from four patients. In summary, two real-time PCR assays targeting different genes were designed and validated for use as screening methods for the detection of HBoV. HBoV was found in three different specimen types: parent-collected combined nose-throat swabs, fecal samples collected from symptomatic individuals and whole blood from immunocompromised children.",

Not being able to apply Koch's postulate due to the inability to culture this virus at this stage, or to be able to apply it to an animal model [Fredericks and Relman, 1996] is hampering efforts to investigate the role this virus plays in disease.

Real-time PCR offers greater sensitivity, increased specificity with the addition of oligoprobes, and the added benefit of a closed detection system, reducing the likelihood of false positive results due to contamination with amplicon [Chieochansin et al., 2008] . Real-time platforms also offer rapid turnaround times with the ability to test for a number of gene targets with multiplexing. With PCR leading the way for the detection of viral agents [Lipson, 2002] , we have developed and validated two real-time assays targeting the non-structural protein (NP-1) gene and the viral protein (VP-1) gene for the detection of HBoV in three different sample types, combined nose-throat swabs (NTS), fecal samples, and whole blood.",

The samples had previously been screened for a range of respiratory viruses . The specimens were extracted using the Corbett X-tractor Gene (Corbett Research, Australia) and tested using the HBoV PCR assays.

Set B were 239 fecal samples collected by Queensland Public Health Units between June and October 2006 from patients with AGE linked to undiagnosed institutional outbreaks. These patients were children, the elderly, or staff from daycare centers, nursing homes, hostels, or hospitals throughout Queensland. The mean age was 40.3 years with the median age being 39.9 years and the age range was 1 month to 97.6 years. These samples were extracted using the Qiagen DNA Stool kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Australia) and were screened using PCR for norovirus, WU polyomavirus, KI polyomavirus, JC, and BK polyomavirus using previously published methods [Hirsch et al., 2001; Kageyama et al., 2003; Pal et al., 2006; Bialasiewicz et al., 2007] .",

Briefly, a plasmid control was constructed using the pGEM-T-Easy vector system (Promega, Madison, USA) containing a VP-1 gene fragment. Plasmid copy number was calculated based on the molecular weight and optical density. Using the Rotogene 6000 (Corbett Research, Brisbane, Australia), 10-fold dilutions of the plasmid were tested in order to create a standard curve, which was used to quantify HBoV viral genomic DNA obtained from a clinical specimen. Dilutions of this quantified HBoV viral genomic DNA were then tested in triplicate in each assay and the limit of detection of each assay was defined by the final dilution in which all three replicates were positive for HBoV.",

A further six samples provided discordant results. These included five samples that were positive in the VP-1 and NP-1 real-time PCR assays but were negative in conventional PCR assay (samples 1-5; Table III ) and one sample that was positive in the VP-1 real-time PCR assay only (sample 6; Table III ). Using the conventional assay as the reference standard, the sensitivity of both real-time NP-1 and VP-1 assays was 100%, with specificities of 94% and 93%, respectively. All six samples providing discordant results provided high cycle threshold (C t ) values ranging from 34 to 38 (Table III) , suggesting the viral loads in these samples were low and probably below the detection limit of the conventional assay. To further investigate these discordant results, these six samples specimens were retested using a nested PCR targeting the bocavirus NP-1 gene and two of the six samples provided positive results. DNA sequencing of the nested PCR product for both specimens provided sequences with 100% homology to bocavirus NP-1 sequences on the Genbank database (accession numbers include EU984096.1, EF450739.1, DQ988934.2).",

In three specimens (23%), HBoV was co-detected with rotavirus, and in a further specimen HBoV was co-detected with rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus. In one case, HBoV was co-detected with adenovirus plus astrovirus. The other 239 fecal samples collected from institutional outbreak patients were also screened for HBoV, of these samples five (2.0%) had HBoV detected by both real-time PCR assays. Four of these had HBoV as the only identified pathogen, whereas one had a co-infection with rotavirus. We tested 229 pediatric whole blood samples from immunocompromised children, with six (2.6%) positive specimens identified by both real-time PCR assays.

Two different gene targets, NP-1 and VP-1, were selected and applied in parallel to overcome potential false negative results due to sequence variants [Whiley et al., 2008] . When compared to the previously published conventional PCR method, these assays were found to have greater analytical sensitivity, with a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction for both assays. However, both real-time assays were statistically shown to have reduced clinical specificity (94% and 93%) compared to the conventional method. This was due to the increased number of detected samples, which were classified as false positive detections by the real-time assay on the basis that they were negative in the conventional assay. However, five out of the six additional positive samples were positive by both real-time PCR methods suggesting they were more likely true-positive samples. This is further supported by the accepted fact that real-time PCR generally has a superior limit of detection compared to conventional PCR methods. Analytical specificity was investigated and no cross-reactions were observed with unrelated viral or bacterial agents (Table II) or human genomic DNA.",

The use of the highly sensitive and specific molecular assays described here will aid these investigations.",
