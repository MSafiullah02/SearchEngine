Respiratory infectious pandemics and epidemics are particularly virulent given their spread via droplets and interpersonal contact (Koh et al., 2012). Nurses, as the largest group of health professionals (World Health Organization, 2020) are at the frontline of the health care system response to both epidemics and pandemics. Nurses deliver care directly to patients in close physical proximity and as such, are often directly exposed to these viruses and are at high risk of developing disease (Hope et al., 2011, Seale et al., 2009). In the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, some 4 of the 70 deaths were nurses (Chiang et al., 2007). Early reports related to COVID-19 indicate that the rate of infection among health care professionals with this virus may be even more extensive (Huang and rong Liu, 2020).",

In particular, the risk of being infected, transmission to family members, stigma about the vulnerabilities of their job and restrictions on personal freedom have been reported as key concerns (Chiang et al., 2007, Hope et al., 2011, Koh et al., 2012, Seale et al., 2009). Complicating the situation for nurses during pandemics are the logistical issues related to supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), and shortages of other necessary resources to support service delivery (Xie et al., 2020). The notion of perceived risk to health professionals during pandemics has been explored in the literature (Koh et al., 2011), although there are fewer studies reporting data about nurses, as distinct from other health professionals, and their experiences of involvement in a pandemic.",

As nurses perceive personal risks as being too high, some decide to leave their jobs (Chiang et al., 2007, Martin et al., 2013, Shiao et al., 2007). This has significant implications for the workforce and ability of health systems to deliver care at a time of heightened need.

Nurses\u2019 have been reported to experience stress associated with separation from family, sleep deprivation and heavy workloads created by health system demand and staff shortages (Huang and rong Liu, 2020). Additionally, the ethical and resource issues that emerge during a pandemic or epidemic can have negative psychological impacts (Johnstone and Turale, 2014, Seale et al., 2009). Being involved in setting up specialised pandemic clinics, staging facility operations or being seconded to areas outside their usual scope of practice can also be stressful (Seale et al., 2009).

Nurses\u2019 eagerness to fulfil their roles during a pandemic, despite the risk of potential infection, evidences their great commitment to patient care (Kang et al., 2018, Koh et al., 2012). Nurses also immersed themselves in patient care as a way of managing their anxiety and pressures in an ever changing and dynamic environment (Liu and Liehr, 2009, Chung et al., 2005). This professional commitment, however, created an ethical and moral dilemma for nurses, with them feeling as though they had to decide between patients and their family responsibilities (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008, Chung et al., 2005). This personal sacrifice resulted in social isolation through separation from family and friends (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008, Chung et al., 2005).",

Concerns over their own susceptibility to infection was largely associated with fear of the new phenomenon, and with the possibility of death (Chung et al., 2005, Kim, 2018, Lam and Hung, 2013). Nurses feared not only being exposed to infected patients, but were scared that infection could be spread through nursing colleagues sharing resources (Koh et al., 2012). Beside their own personal health, nurses feared that with the uncertainty of the working environment and new disease threat that they were placing their family and friends at greater risk of infection (Shih et al., 2007, Lam and Hung, 2013). Nurses were particularly concerned with spreading the infection to vulnerable family members, such as the elderly, immunocompromised and young children (Ives et al., 2009, Lam and Hung, 2013, Koh et al., 2012). Providing protection for family members was perceived as a priority, with some nurses choosing to self-isolate as a protection strategy (Lam and Hung, 2013).",

Nurses felt vulnerable and worried about future litigation related to the need to prioritise resources and patient needs in a time where they had to ration and deny services to some patients (Ives et al., 2009). The sense of powerlessness was overwhelming for nurses as they were under extreme pressure and often feared that their practice was being affected by work demands and community fear generated by the pandemic (Lam and Hung, 2013, Chung et al., 2005). Despite the professional camaraderie, the unfamiliarity of the pandemic environment created a sense of loneliness (Kim, 2018) and frustration among nurses. Additionally, relatives of patients were seen to be projecting their emotions towards the nurses (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008, Kim, 2018). Not having control over patient flow also generated both physical and psychological exhaustion (Kang et al., 2018). Deaths amongst some of their nursing colleagues as a result of the pandemic created uncertainty and heightened anxiety and stress (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008, Koh et al., 2012).",

The uncertainty that the level of protection provided to nursing staff was effective and efficient to minimise infection risk affected many nurses\u2019 ability to cope (Ives et al., 2009, Corley et al., 2010). Other nurses felt that there was conflicting advice and a lack of consensus on the appropriate infection control measures (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008). Despite low PPE supplies in some hospitals, nurses demonstrated their resilience by collaborating with colleagues to develop alternative protection, with some using disposable raincoats as PPE (Shih et al., 2007).",

Many nurses wanted to ensure that they were equipped with the appropriate information to provide quality patient care. Yet nurses expressed inadequate training in caring for patients affected by an emerging infectious disease (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008, Lam et al., 2020, Liu and Liehr, 2009). Given that the infectious disease was so new, modifications of policies and guidelines were updated swiftly, which created confusion as to the most up-to-date versions (Lam and Hung, 2013, Holroyd and McNaught, 2008). This confusion also exacerbated nurses\u2019 anxiety and perception of risk. The communication of information was often felt to be difficult and not succinct thus creating additional confusion and distress for the already busy nurses (Corley et al., 2010, Chung et al., 2005).",

One of the major factors that influenced nurses\u2019 ability to cope with the demanding workload during the pandemic were staffing shortages (Lam and Hung, 2013, Kang et al, 2018, Corley et al., 2010). A lack of staff made ensuring adequate staff skill mix for managing high acuity patients challenging, not only creating pressure on more junior staff but also the senior staff who had to support them (Corley et al., 2010). Such pressure on the nursing workforce meant nurses had to adapt to changes quickly, often in suboptimal conditions, with high patient turnover and limited isolation rooms (Holroyd and McNaught, 2008, Wong et al., 2011, Liu and Liehr, 2009). Nurses believe that one of their greatest challenges working during the pandemic was a lack of preparedness planning at both a management and health department level (Kok et al., 2012, Lam et al, 2020).",

This engagement needs to be multifaceted and recognise the importance of nurses and the nursing role to pandemic and epidemic control. It is vital that nurses receive clear, concise and current information about best practice nursing care and infection control, as well as sufficient access to appropriate PPE to optimise their safety. Adequate staffing is essential to ensure that nurses are able to take breaks during shifts, take leave when they are ill and provide appropriate skill mix. Support for nurses to manage competing family responsibilities and maintain safe contact and communication with family members can reduce personal stress and anxiety. Finally, the physical and psychological impact of working during a pandemic or epidemic on nurses needs to be recognised and made visible. To promote physical and mental health among nurses and ensure that they stay in the workforce, Governments, policy makers, nursing groups and health care organisations must closely monitor nurses\u2019 support needs both during the pandemic or epidemic and in the following period and be agile and responsive to these with meaningful support systems. Without this support nurses are likely to experience significant stress, anxiety, and physical side-effects all of which can lead to burnout and loss of nurses from the workforce.",
