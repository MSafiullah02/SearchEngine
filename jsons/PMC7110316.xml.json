To date, many cases have been reported from over 60 countries (Burns & Glode, 2004). Several investigations have revealed that Kawasaki disease consists of systemic vasculitis with hypercytokinemia (Furukawa et al., 1988; Maury et al., 1988; Ueno et al., 1989; Matsubara et al., 1990; Eberhard et al., 1995; Asano & Ogawa, 2000). A number of reports indicate that the development of Kawasaki disease might be associated with bacterial or viral infections such as those caused by Staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic Streptococcus, Yersinia, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, human herpesvirus-6, or human coronavirus (Kikuta et al., 1988; Akiyama & Yashiro, 1993; Leung et al., 1993; Abe et al., 1997; Ihira et al., 2002; Esper et al., 2005). However, the etiology of Kawasaki disease is still controversial.",

Recently, Karasawa et al. have reported that autoantibodies to peroxiredoxin II are found predominantly in the sera of patients with autoimmune diseases who have systemic vasculitis (Karasawa et al., 2003; Ozaki 2004). A homolog of peroxiredoxin II is also conserved in many microorganisms, and this homolog is also expressed in BCG at a higher level than in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Springer et al., 2001). Thus, cross-reactive immune responses, which might be triggered by a microorganism that possesses cross-reactive antigens, could be associated with the development of Kawasaki's disease.",

After being washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4, 1000 g, 10 min), the bacteria were lysed by overnight incubation at room temperature with a 10-fold volume of 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ), and then washed 10 times with PBS to remove the supernatant and SDS. The bacterial lysate was incubated sequentially with 250 \u00b5g mL\u22121 RNAse, DNAse I, and trypsin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) for 4 h. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed four times with PBS. Crude lysate was then obtained by sonication of the pellet (5 g wet weight in 20 mL of PBS) on ice for 2 h (5-s pulse, then a 1-s pause, at a fixed frequency of 20 kHz). The sonicated preparation was then centrifuged for 1 h at 40 000 g. at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was harvested for injection.

Peroxiredoxin II may be a regulator of platelet-derived growth factor and remodeling (Choi et al., 2005). In patients with autoimmune diseases who have systemic vasculitis, antibodies to peroxiredoxin II have been demonstrated (Karasawa et al., 2003). Thus, peroxiredoxin II might be an important target of systemic vasculitis. This molecule is conserved in mammals and microorganisms, including mycobacteria (Hofmann et al., 2002). Antibodies that are cross-reactive to this molecule after a microbial infection might induce destruction of the endothelium and also inhibit its function during the healing process.",
