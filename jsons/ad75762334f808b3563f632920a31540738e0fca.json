Numerous viruses have heen imphcated in the etiology of MS and relapses of MS have heen associated in some cases with viral infections (3, [8] [9] [10] [11] .

            "text": "Several theories have heen proposed to explain how infection cotdd initiate MS (12) . First, an infection in the CNS will produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These factors will cause non-specific recruitment of lymphocytes to the site of infection. Some of the lymphocytes could be specific for CNS antigens and undergo activation in situ, initiating an autoreactive response in the target organ. Second, opening of the blood brain barrier due to inflammation may expose the immune system to normally sequestered CNS antigens. Under these circumstances, naive T lymphocytes that have not undergone tolerance may be activated hy self-antigens in the CNS. Third, molecular mimicry of CNS antigens by microbial antigens may result in activation of cross-reactive T lymphocytes (i3, 14) . In support of the molecular mimicry hypothesis, some T-cell clones and lines established from MS patients demonstrated cross-reactivity for hoth CNS antigens and peptides derived from various human viruses (15, 16) . In addition, a peptide from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also able to activate a T-cei! clone specific for MBP (15) .",

It is characterized hy perivascular inflammatory lesions in the white matter of the CNS (18), demonstrating a similar pathology to MS. EAE can be induced in many species either by immunization with CNS antigens in complete Freund's adjuvant or by adoptive transfer of activated CNS-specific T cells into naive recipients (19, 20) , Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that MHC class Il-restricted CD4+ T cells secreting inflammatory cytokines (Thl helper cells) are the primary agents mediating EAE (21), Like MS, susceptibihty to EAE is correlated with expression of particular MHC class II genes. Among mice, the strains that have been most commonly employed in studies of EAE are SJL mice that express H-2^ MHC alleles and Bl O.PL or PL/J mice that express H-2\" MHC alleles. These strains demonstrate some interesting differences. Bl O.PL mice respond primarily to myehn basic protein (MBP). The T-cell response to MBP in this strain is very restricted. There appears to be a single immunodominant epitope consisting of the amino-terminal peptide MBPl-11 (22) .Thereisalsolitdeheterogeneity in the primary structures of the T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize this epitope. The majority of MBP 1-11 -speciflc T cells employ the Vp8.2 gene segment paired with either the V<,2.3 or 4.2 gene segment (23, 24) . Subdominant responses to MBP31-50 and MBP121-140 have also been reported, representing a minor fraction of the T-cell proliferative response to MBP in these mice (25, 26) .",

            "text": "EAE has been a very useful model to investigate the effector cells contributing to CNS autoimmune disease. Studies of EAE demonstrated that autoreactive. CNS-specific T cells are a normal part of the T-cell repertoire in healthy animals. These cells only become pathogenic following exposure to an exogenous stimulus. Differentiation of CNS-specific T cells into Thl cells that .secrete inflammatory cytokhit!> is an important requirement for disease induction. Activation nf these T cells results in expression of adhesion markers that facihtate their interaction with endothelial cells comprising the blood brain barrier and promote entry into the CNS (3 1-34), Entry of Thl T cells into the CNS and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-] 2, interferon (IEN)-Yand tumor necrosis factor (TNE)-a elicit the production of chemokines that cause a further influx of monocytes and non-speciflc T cells (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) . The toxic effects of TNE-a and nitric oxide produced by T cells and macrophages play an important role in damaging the myelin sheath (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) , Recovery mechanisms from this inflammatory response are not well understood. They appear to involve in part the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. IL-4 and transforming growth factor (TGE)-p (46) (47) (48) (49) . Production of these cytokines may be the result of generating Th2 T cells which have been shown in some cases (50) (51) (52) hut not in others (53, 54) to suppress EAE. Apoptosis of CNS antigen-specific T cells that infiltrated the tissue has also heen imphcated in recovery from EAE (55) (56) (57) (58) . EAE is a model system to test therapies for MS In addition to defining many of the events that are critical to the effector stage of disease, EAE has been a valuahle model for developing therapeutic strategies. Approaches to inhihit EAE have targeted different steps in the pathogenesis of the disease. Several strategies have used either antihodies directed against pro-inflammatory cytokines, soluhle cytokine receptors or inhibitors of specific cytokine activity to prevent EAE (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) , Direct administration of anti-inflammatory cytokines has also been used to regulate EAE (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) . Encephahtogenic T cells have been targeted in a number of ways. Antibodies against V genes expressed on encephalitogenic T cells have been used to eliminate T cells mediating disease (71) , Vaccination of animals with inactivated encephahtogenic T cells (72) or specific peptides derived from V genes expressed on these cells (73, 74) has also been effective in inhibiting EAE in some systems. Other strategies have utilized knowledge of the antigen specificity of T cells to inhibit disease. Several studies have shown that exposing encephalitogenic T cells to altered peptides, variants of the wild-type peptide sequence normally recognized hy the T cell, can change the pattern of cytokine secretion from inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines. This approach has been used effectively to inhibit EAE (75) (76) (77) (78) . Exposing animals to CNS antigens administered by different routes, such as intravenous, oral or intranasal, also prevents induction of EAE (79) (80) (81) . Several of these studies have led to the design of therapies and clinical trials that may be useful in the treatment of MS.",

MBP was beheved to be sequestered behind the blood brain barrier and therefore not presented to T cells under conditions that would induce tolerance. Alternatively, exposure to MBP may induce T-cell tolerance, but the MBPl-11-specific T cells may represent a specific subset ofT cells that escape tolerance.",

We did not detect significant responses to MBP3i-50 or MBPl 21-1 40 that had been reported by other investigators as subdominant MBP epitopes (2 5, 91), In contrast to wild-type mice, immunized MBP-'-mice generated very strong T-cell responses to two distinct epitopes witliin the MBP121-150 region of the protein. The response to MBPl-11 was very weak in comparison to the MBP121-150 epitopes. These data demonstrate that the true immunodominant epitopes of MBP are within MBP121-150 and that endogenous expression of MBP induces tolerance in T cells responding to this region (90) . These observations also exclude the hypothesis that MBPl-11-specific T cells do not undergo tolerance hecause MBP is a sequestered antigen that is invisible to the immune system. Tolerance to MBP has also been demonstrated by comparing T-cell responses to MBP in C3H MBP-' and wild-type mice (92) , Further characterization of the MBPi21-150-speciflc T cells found in MBP-'-mice revealed that this response is unexpectedly complex (93) . Two distinct, non-overlapping epitopes represented by MBPl25-135 and MBP 136-146 are present in this region that form very stable complexes with I-A\" MHC molecules in vitro. The half-times of dissociation of these peptides are 270 and 180 h respectively Analyses of the residues that function as TCR contacts in these epitopes demonstrated tbat the antigenic surfaces of these tw-o peptide/MHC complexes lack any structural similarity Thus, it was very surprising that most of the T cells that respond to this region of MBP are cross-reactive for both epitopes. Even more intriguing was the observation that recognition by the cross-reactive T cells was lost when functional TCR contacts were interchanged between the two epitopes. Thus, the T cells appear to adopt mutually exclusive conformations to achieve specific re-Immumiiugirai RCTTCVVS 169/1999 Goverman \u2022 TCR trdnssenic models of EAE cognition of iwo distinct epitopes that present very different antigenic surfaces (93) . Interestingly, the few T cells speciflc for this region of MBP that escape tolerance in wild-type mice recognize peptides that contain the first hut not the second epitope (90), Very few T cells that recognize the epitopes within MBP121-150 escape tolerance in wild-type mice. To understand how tolerance to the imtnunogenic epitopes of this selfantigen occurs, we turned again to the powerful system of antigen-specific TCR transgenic mice. Using two sets of genes that encode TCRs cross-reactive for both MBP 125-135 and MBP136-146, we generated several lines of TCR transgenic mice. Our prehminary data indicate that the transgenic T cells may undergo some tolerance during maturation in the thymus but a number of transgenic T cells are exported to the periphery (E, Husehy, J. Goverman, unpuhlished ohservations). In prehminary experiments, the transgenic T cells on a heterozygous H-2'\"''^\"'\"'' background retain the ability to respond to one epitope within MBP i 21 -1 5 0 but not to the MBP 131-150 peptide that contains the second epitope. This response is similar to the reactivity of the few remaining MBP121-140-specific T cells that escape tolerance in wild-type mice (90), These models will be very valuable in defining the mechanisms of tolerance induced by endogenous expression of MBP in vivo.",

This result w-as expected given the high precursor frequency of functional MBPl-11-specific T cells in the periphery. Immunization of the TCR p-chain transgenic mice with MBP1-! I peptide also induced EAE, consistent with the high precursor frequency of MBPl-i l-specific T cells in these mice (84) . Surprisingly, administration of pertussis toxin alone to the MBPl -11 TCR transgenic mice without immunization with MBP also resulted in a high incidence of EAE (82), The mechanism by which pertussis toxin induces EAE in the transgenic mice is not known. One reported function of pertussis toxin is to promote access of lymphocytes to the CNS by increasing permeability of the blood brain harrier (94, 95) . The ability of pertussis toxin alone to trigger EAE in the transgenic mice suggested that entry into the CNS might be the critical checkpoint in the iniliation of autoimmune disease. We tested this idea by determining whether injection of transgenic MBPl-11-speciflc T cells directly into the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of non-transgenic recipient mice was sufflcient to induce EAE, Injection of transgenic splenocytes that had been activated in vitro by exposure to MBPl-11 induced a high incidence of EAE (96) , Surprisingly, injection of non-stimnlated transgenic splenocytes as w-ell as non-stimulated purified T cells also induced EAE although at a lower frequency These results suggested that the presence of high numbers of CD4-M BP-specific T cells behind the blood brain barrier where MBP is expressed might he sufficient to trigger disease (96) , These experiments also demonstrated that EAE induced hy injection of pertussis toxin is manifested differently than EAE induced by intrathecal injection of MBP 1 -11-specific transgenic T cells into the CSF. EAE induced hy injection of pertussis toxin in MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice was significantly more severe and demonstrated fewer relapses than EAE induced by intralhecal injection of activated or resting transgenic T cells (96) , A difference in the course of disease induced by these two methods w-ould not be expected if the only effect of pertussis toxin was to facilitate access ofT cells lo the CNS, Thus, exposure to pertussis toxin appears to influence EAE in multiple w-ays.",

The ohservation that the incidence of spontaneous EAE depended on environmental conditions under which the mice were housed represents a potentially important parallel with MS, Therefore, we sought to determine if spontaneous EAE was triggered by differences in microbial exposure or some other environmental factor. In our initial studies, several environmental differences in addition to microbial flora, such as food, water and caging, existed between the two colonies. To investigate specifically the role of microbes in triggering EAE in the transgenic mice, we established two cohorts of genetically equivalent MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice that had been backcrossed onto BIO,PL for ten generations and had either conventional or limited microbial flora. Mice in both cohorts were housed in microisolators with identical food, water and bedding and were monitored over a 12-week period for symptoms of EAE. The incidence of spontaneous EAE shown in Fig. 2 was significantly higher in the conventional mice (43%) compared to the SPF mice (15%, p=0,017), indicating that exposure to microbes facilitates the induction of EAE (96) . This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that MS is triggered by exposure to pathogens.",

These mice express a transgenic TCR specific for MBP 1-11 utilizing Vo4.2 and V,,8.2 obtained from PL/J mice (98) . We backcrossed these MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice 11 generations onto the BIO.PL background and compared spontaneous disease in a cohort of these conventionally housed mice to our conventionally housed MBP 1-11 TCR transgenic mice that had been backcrossed for ten generations onto BIO.PL. Surprisingly, the data in Fig. 2 show that the incidence of spontaneous EAE was significandy lower (11,1% versus 41.78%, p = 0.003) in the MBPl-l 1 TCR transgenic mice expressing the Vj,4,2/V(i8,2 transgenic TCR than the MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice expressing the Vo2,3/Va8,2 TCR. Because these mice had both been backcrossed extensively onto BIO.PL and were housed in the same 152 Immunological Reviews 169/1999 Immunoregulation in MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice We compared thecharacteristicsof EAE that occurs in MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice either spontaneously or following administration of pertussis toxin, as well as EAE that is induced by intrathecal injection of transgenic T cells into non-transgenic recipients (96) . In both spontaneous EAE and EAE induced hy pertussis toxin, the maximum severity of symptoms is fairly high, with over half of the cases reaching grade three severity (Fig. 3A) , The disease is usually chronic, with improvement observed in some cases, but complete recovery seen less often. Relapses are infrequently observed in either spontaneous or pertussis toxin-induced EAE (Fig, 3B) . Manifestation of EAE induced by intrathecal injection, however, is strikingly different. The incidence of disease is high, but the severity of EAE induced by this method never exceeded grade one. In addition, relapses were observed in almost half of the cases. Thus, EAE that is tnediated hy MBP-specific transgenic T cells is manifested very differently depending on how these T cells are triggered and/or how they enter the CNS, These observations suggest that the different methods of disease induction using transgenic T cells stimulate different mechanisms of immune regulation. Interestingly, the CNS lesions in mice with intrathecally induced EAE were much more severe than lesions seen in mice with either spontaneous or pertussis toxin-induced EAE despite the very mild clinical symptoms (96) . On a scale of 0 to 5, the average severity of cellular infiltrates was 4,3 in intrathecally-injected mice and i in mice with spontaneous EAE, A lack of correlation between severity of clinical symptoms and pathology in EAE has been noted in other studies (99, 100), One of the most intriguing ohservations regarding spontaneous EAE in the TCR transgenic mice is that, despite a very large population of functional MBP-specific T cells in the periphery, disease incidence does not reach 100% even in mice that are housed together in a conventional facihty (96) , This suggests that peripheral tolerance mechanisms function in these mice to prevent the occurrence of autoimmune disease and that these mechanisms fail with some stochastic frequency in a percentage of the mice.",

A low incidence of spontaneous EAE was observed in these transgenic mice under SPF conditions but the incidence increased to 100% when the transgenic TCR was crossed onto the Rag-'-background. Recently, two studies of this MBPl-11 TCR transgenic model have implicated CD4-*-T cells expressing endogenous TCRs as the cells responsible for providing protection against the development of spontaneous EAE in MBP TCR transgenic mice on the Rag+' ' + background (101, 102) , Crosses of the transgenic TCR to mice deficient in Govorman \u2022 TCR transgenic models of EAE B ceils, CDS' T cells, NK-T cells or yb T cells did not increase the incidence of spontaneous EAE. How-ever, crossing the TCR otito a Rag-'-, Q,\"'\" or C^-''\" hackground significantly increased spontaneous EAE. Adoptive transfer of CD4-T cells from nontransgenic mice into MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice on the Rag-''-hackground decreased the incidence of spontaneous EAE. These adoptive transfer experiments also indicated that TCR Cransgenic Rag-''-mice had to receive the CD4-^ T cells from non-transgenic mice at an early age (40 days old or younger) to he fully protected frcmi spontaneous EAE (101, 1 02). The mechanism hy which these regulatory T cells protect MBPl-1 1 TCR transgenic mice from EAE is not known.",

In these studies, it was found that the TCR pchain mice produce a population ofT ceils that are specific for determinants expressed on the transgenic p-chain itself (103). can traffic to the CNS and whether MBP-specific T cells that have not been previonsly activated can be stimulated by encountering endogenous MBP in this tissue. Iti analyzing T lymphocytes isolated from the CNS of healthy MBP TCR transgenic and non-transgenic mice, we first made the sttrprising ohservacion that comparable numbers of T cells are present in this tissue in transgenic and non-transgenic mice. This finding was unexpected because only activated T cells are believed to traffic to the CNS, and there are significantly fewer activated T cells in the periphery of TCR transgenic mice that do not have EAE compared to non-transgenic mice. TCR transgenic mice have fewer activated T cells in the periphery because the TCR repertoire is very restricted and therefore the chance that environmental antigens can activate T cells is reduced. Also unexpected was the observation that, while the majority of T cells in the CNS in non-transgenic mice exhihit an activated phetiotype, most of the T cells isolated from the CNS of young MBP TCR transgenic mice exhibited a naive phenotype (T, Brabb, J. Goverman, manuscript in preparation). We have now analyzed several other TCR transgenic models that were not specific for CNS antigens. We found that the number ofT cells in the CNS of these TCR transgenic mice was also comparahle to the number in non-transgenic mice and that their phenotype was predominantly naive. These data suggest that there is a steady state numher of T cells chat traffic through the CNS in a healthy animal. While activated T cells appear to have a preferential advantage in trafficking to this tissue, naive T cells can traffic to the CNS in the ahsence of \"competition\" from activated T cells in the periphery. One of the most interesting ohservations from these studies is that increased numbers of memory MBP-specific T cells are found in the CNS of older MBP TCR transgenic mice that do not exhihit any signs of clinical disease. Thus, an increase in the numher of activated and memory T cells in the CNS of MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice does not appear to be sufficient for the induction of HAE.",

            "text": "Immunization wich recombinant rat (but not mouse) Vp8 protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant was ohserved to protect TCR p-chain transgenic mice from the subsequent induction of EAE(84). Tolerization of TCR p-chain mice by neonatal administration of recombinant rat V|i8 protein caused more severe EAE in adult transgenic animals immunized with MBP(104).Similar findings have heen ohserved in non-transgenic rat and mouse models of EAB(73,74,105). The V[j8-specific regulatory T cells appear to infiuence the activity of MBP 1-11 -specific T cells in the TCR p-chain mice by a cytokine-driven mechanism(84). CD8\"^ V[)8-specific T cells have heen proposed also to play a role in affecting the activity (jf MBPl-11-specific T cells (106); however, these cells have not heen investigated in MBPl-11 TCR transgenic models.TCR transgenic mice as toois for designing new therapies MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mice offer a unique opportunity to investigate potential therapies for CNS autoimmune disease because Che generation and suhsequent fate in vivo of effector T cells that mediate disease can be directly monitored in these models. In the first example of this approach, we examined the mechanism hy which high antigen dose treatment blocks MBPl-11-specific T cells from tnediating EAE(107), Boehme & Lenardo demonstrated that apoptosis occurs when exposure to high concentration of antigen causes re-engagement of TCRs expressed on activated T cells that were already cycling in response Co IL-2 (108). This system was used to show that exposure of MBP 1-11 -specific transgenic T cells to high concentration of antigen could induce apoptosis in vicro and specifically eliminate transgenic T cells in vivo(107). Transgenic T cells wereactivated in viiro and adoptively transferred into the periphery of of administering soluhle antigen in vivo has subsequently heen studied in several other MBPl-11 TCR transgenic mouse models. Pearson and colleagues examined the effect of injecting soluble rat MBPAcl-1 1 and variants of this peptide that hind the I-A\" molecules with higher affmity into MBPl-I i TCR transgenic mice (88). Their results showed that all soluhle peptides were able to induce transient activation of transgenic T cells in vivo as measured by the expression of several activation markers. Peptides with high affinity for the MHC molecule then induced downregulation of the TCR as well. Apoptosis of transgenic T cells was also observed in this system, with the extent of apoptosis correlating with che affinity of che injected peptides for I-A\". Both proliferative T-cell responses in viCro and deletion ofT cells in vivo increased in mice that received higher affinity peptides. The simtiltaneous expansion and deletion in vivo had compensatory effects such that no net kDss ofT cells was ohserved following injection of soluhle peptide in cransgenic PL/J mice. Interestingly, peripheral deletion ofT cells expressing the same cransgenic TCR appeared to be higher on che BIO.PL hackground compared to PL/] tnice. In these MBPl-1 I TCR transgenic mice, injection of the peptide with the highest affinity for I-A\" MHC molecules, MBPAc 1 -11 [4Y], induced differentiation in vivo of the transgenic T cells into a protective Th2 phenocype, while the native, low affinity MBPAcl-11 peptide stimulated Thl cytokine responses. In contrast to induction of tolerance by deletion of cransgenic T cells or induction of Th2 T cells, other investigators have reported that injection of soluble peptide into different MBPl-11-specific TCR transgenic mice induces non-responsiveness. In one model, chronic administration of soluhle mouse MBP Acl-9[4Y] peptide was required co achieve profound non-responsiveness in transgenic T cells (87). In studies of a different MBPl -1 1 TCR transgenic mode), intrapericoneal injection of mouse MBP Acl-17 in cither incomplete or complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in non-responsiveness or anergy of the transgenic T cells (109). Proliferative responses were not restored hy the addition of IL-2 in vitro. The ahility to achieve tolerance when complete Freund's adjuvant, a potent sdmulant of the immune system, was used with the injected peptide is not understood. Tolerance occurred in both Fas--\"and IL-4-''-mice in this system, suggesting that the non-transgenic mice have also been used to investigate the mechanisms of oral tolerance in inhibiting EAF. Oral tolerance is defined as the aniigen-specific suppression of the immune response following oral administration of antigen. Several mechanisms have been propcjsed as the hasis for induction of oral tolerance. Low doses of fed antigen appear to induce antigen-specific regulatory cells that secrete TGF-p, IL-4 and IL-10. These regulatory cells may then mediate suppression ofTh] responses occurring in other tissues including the CNS. High doses of fed antigen appear to induce T-cell anergy and/or deletion. Feeding low doses of MBP to MBP TCR transgenic mice developed by Lafaille eC al. (97) resulted in production of TGF-p, IL-4 and !L-1 0 by transgenic splenocytes and adoptive transfer of these splenocytes inhihited induction of EAE in recipient animals (110). In a separate study, feeding high doses of MBP to MBP 1-11 TCR transgenic animals developed by Goverman et al. (82) resulted in a rapid depletion of transgenic T cells from peripheral lymphoid organs and an Increase in the transgenic T cells in the intestine (111). This depletion resulted in a decrease in proliferative responses to MBP hy T cells in lymphoid organs and protected the transgenic mice from subsequent EAF induction, MBP TCR transgenic mice will no doubt continue to serve as powerful tools Co Cest new therapies for EAE. Many questions remain concerning protocols involving antigen-specific therapies, including the effectiveness of exposure to specific peptide variants in inhihiting EAE, Data regarditig the exiscence of regulatory T cells in controlling aut(nmmune responses in the CNS open new areas of investigation using these models. Thus, the potential of these models to test novel therapeutic strategies in treating autoitntnune disease is just heginning to be realized. New directions in the study of CNS autoimmune disease using TCR transgenic mice Triggers of CNS autoimmune disease The unique properties of the MBP TCR transgenic mice alkjwed us to investigate several issues of CNS autoimmune disease that could not he addressed in classic models of EAE. The ohservation that exposure to microbes elicited spontaneous EAE in MBPl-1 1 TCR transgenic mice suggested that this model may he useful to invescigace mechanisms by which pathogens trigger disease in susceptihle animals. Our initial experiments focused oti the ability of different bacteria to trigger EAE in the MBP TCR transgenic mice. We tested the ability of Streptococcus pneumonioe to induce EAE when the hacceria were injected directly itito the CSF. Our results indicate that intrathecal injection in the lumbar spinal cord of either live or heat-killed bacteria induced EAE in the transgenic mice at a high incidence (T Brahh, J. Goverman, unpublished ohservations). Interestingly, injection of the same hacteria into che CSE in the cisterna magna at the base of che brain induced EAE at a significant but lower incidence chan intrachecal injection in tbe spinal cord, eveti though bacteria were injected into the CSF in hoth protocols. The reason for this difference in incidence of EAE is not yet clear. The ability of the hacceria to induce EAF following introduction into the CNS was not entirely surprising. Exposure to bacteria triggers the innate immune system, resulting in infiltration of white blood cells, including lymphocytes, into the CNS. Thus, a large number of cransgenic T cells will cross the blood brain barrier and enter a CNS in which che concentration of inflammatory cytokines is already increased. These conditions are likely to result in activation of the transgenic MBP-specific T cells. The experiments described above indicate that a bacterial infectioti in the CNS can trigger EAE in TCR transgenic mice. It is not clear, however, that this method exhihits any parallels to the conditions under which MS is initiated in humans. Therefore, we were also interested in determining whether a peripheral infection of hacteria could trigger EAE in the MBP TCR transgenic mice. Our preliminary experiments indicate chat intraperit(jneal injection of either S, pneumoniae or Group B Streptococcus induces FAE iti the MBP TCR transgenic mice. We are currently investigating the mechanisms responsible for triggering EAE with these hacceria. The MBPl-11-specific transgenic T cells do not proliferate in response co Group B Streptococcus in vitro, and injeccion of heat-killed bacteria does not induce EAE. These data argue againsc a molecular mimicry mechanism in which the transgenic TCR is stimulated hy a cross-reactive antigen present in the bacteria. Interestingly, preliminary results indicate that injection of Escherichio coli does not trigger EAE in the MBP TCR transgenic mice, although cotnparahle numhers of bacteria have not heen used in these experiments (T. Brahb, J, Goverman, unpublished observations). Despite the lack of disease in transgenic mice injected with E, coli, MBPl-l 1-specific transgenic T cells appear to proliferate in vitro in response to E. coli antigens. Future experiments will investigate the mechanisms hy which hacterial infection triggers EAE in the MBPl-1 1 TCR transgenic mice and also address the ability of viral infections to induce EAF in this mouse model.
