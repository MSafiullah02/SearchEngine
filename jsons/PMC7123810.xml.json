Because bioterrorism is difficult to predict or prevent, reliable platforms to rapidly detect and identify bioterrorism agents are important in order to minimize the spread and wide use of these agents and to protect the public health. These platforms must be sensitive, specific, and must also be able to accurately detect a variety of pathogens, including modified or previously uncharacterized agents, directly from complex sample matrices. Recent developments in laboratory prototype devices have been evaluated and were commercialized. Various commercial tests that utilize biochemical, immunological, nucleic acid, and bioluminescence procedures are currently available to identify biological threat agents. Recent developed tests identify bioterrorism agents using DNA aptamers, biochips, evanescent wave biosensors, cantilevers, living cells, and other innovative technologies. This review describes current and developing technologies against bioterrorism and considers challenges to rapid, accurate detect biothreat agents. Although there is no ideal platform, many of these technologies have proved valuable for the detection and identification of bioterrorism agents.",

Shortly after the start of World War I, Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in the United States, Russia, Romania, and France. Anton Dilger was sent to the United States in 1915 carrying cultures of glanders, a virulent disease of horses and mules. Dilger set up a laboratory in his house. He used stevedores working in the docks in Baltimore to infect horses with glanders while they were waiting to be shipped to Britain. Dilger was under suspicion as being a German agent, but was never arrested. Dilger eventually fled to Madrid, Spain, where he died during the Influenza Pandemic of 1918. In 1916, the Russians arrested a German agent with similar intentions. Germany and its allies infected French cavalry horses and many of Russia\u2019s mules and horses on the Eastern Front. These actions hindered artillery and troop movements, as well as supply convoys.\n",

Some believe that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, cultures of smallpox have become available in other countries. Although people born pre-1970 would have been vaccinated for smallpox under the WHO program, the effectiveness of vaccination is limited since the vaccine provides high level of immunity for only 3 to 5 years. Revaccination\u2019s protection lasts longer. As a biological weapon smallpox is dangerous because of the highly contagious nature of both the infected and their pox.

Analytes may be whole bacterial or fungal cells, virus particles, or specific molecules, such as chemicals or protein toxins, produced by the infectious agent. Peptides and nucleic acids are most commonly used as probes in biosensors because of their versatility in forming various tertiary structures. The interaction between the probe and the analyte can be detected by various sensor platforms, including quartz crystal microbalances, surface acoustical waves, surface plasmon resonance, amperometrics, and magnetoelastics.

This occurs primarily through the efforts of the Office of Health Affairs (OHA), a part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), whose role is to prepare for an emergency situation that impacts the health of the American populace. Detection has two primary technological factors. First there is OHA\u2019s BioWatch program in which collection devices are disseminated to thirty high risk areas throughout the country to detect the presence of aerosolized biological agents before symptoms present in patients [8]. This is significant primarily because it allows a more proactive response to a disease outbreak rather than the more passive treatment of the past.\nImplementation of the Generation-3 automated detection system. This advancement is significant simply because it enables action to be taken in four to six hours due to its automatic response system, whereas the previous system required aerosol detectors to be manually transported to laboratories [8]. Resilience is a multifaceted issue as well, as addressed by OHA. One way in which this is ensured is through exercises that establish preparedness; programs like the Anthrax Response Exercise Series exist to ensure that, regardless of the incident, all emergency personnel will be aware of the role they must fill. Moreover, by providing information and education to public leaders, emergency medical services and all employees of the DHS, OHS suggests that it can significantly decrease the impact of bioterrorism [8].\nEnhancing the technological capabilities of first responders. This is accomplished through numerous strategies. The first of these strategies was developed by the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) of DHS to ensure that the danger of suspicious powders could be effectively assessed, (as many dangerous biological agents such as anthrax exist as a white powder). By testing the accuracy and specificity of commercially available systems used by first responders, the hope is that all biologically harmful powders can be rendered ineffective.\nEnhanced equipment for first responders. One recent advancement is the commercialization of a new form of Tyvex\u2122 armor which protects the first responders and patients from chemical and biological contaminants. There has also been a new generation of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBA) which has been recently made more robust against bioterrorism agents. All of these technologies combine to form what seems like a relatively strong deterrent to bioterrorism. However, New York City as an entity has numerous organizations and strategies that effectively serve to deter and respond to bioterrorism as it comes. From here the logical progression is into the realm of New York City\u2019s specific strategies to prevent bioterrorism.\nBioShield The accrual of vaccines and treatments for potential biological threats, also known as medical countermeasures has been an important aspect in preparing for a potential bioterrorist attack; this took the form of a program beginning in 2004, referred to as Project BioShield. The significance of this program should not be overlooked as there is currently enough smallpox vaccine to inoculate every United States citizen and a variety of therapeutic drugs to treat the infected. The Department of Defense also has a variety of laboratories currently working to increase the quantity and efficacy of countermeasures that comprise the national stockpile [9]. Efforts have also been taken to ensure that these medical countermeasures are able to be disseminated effectively in the event of a bioterrorist attack. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores championed this cause by encouraging the participation of the private sector in improving distribution of such countermeasures if required [9].\n",

He explains how, even though the United States would be better fending off bioterrorist attacks now than they would be a decade ago, the amount of money available to fight bioterrorism over the last three years has begun to decrease. Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty-one American cities, Dr. Gupta stated that the cities \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to distribute vaccines as well\u201d and \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to track viruses\u201d. He went on to say that movie portrayals of global pandemics, such as Contagion, were actually quite possible and may occur in the United States under the right conditions.",

The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack. The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack. He said how \u201cbiological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse\u201d. Furthermore, Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money, but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places. The broadcast suggested that the nation was not ready for something more serious.",

RODS is designed to collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other systems like it, collect data from sources including clinic data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales [10]. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the Codirector of the RODS laboratory, conceived the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \u201cnon-traditional\u201d (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory\u2019s first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nationwide [10].",
