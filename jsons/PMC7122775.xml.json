In contrast to DNA targets, which are relatively stable, researchers who study RNA viruses, such as picornaviruses, are familiar with the plasticity of viral genomes. This high variability poses particular challenges for the design of pan-reactive oligonucleotide primers to reliably amplify complete viral complementary DNAs (cDNAs). For viruses such as FMDV, the existence of multiple serotypes (whose nucleotide sequences may vary by as much as 50% in some genome regions) can further complicate the identification of suitable target sequences.",

In both of these approaches (adopted for the characterization of FMD outbreaks in the United Kingdom in 2001 and 2007), a large number of specific primers were required. Furthermore, these oligonucleotides are specific for defined lineages of FMDV, limiting their use for study of other genotypes of FMDV. Other FMD laboratories have used similar approaches also requiring large numbers of primers (11\u201315). Additional protocols, such as rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), can be used to generate sequence data for the terminal ends of the genome and regions close to the poly (C) tract of FMDV. To reduce the complexity of the cycle-sequencing reactions, recognition sequences for universal sequencing primers (such as M13) can be incorporated into the 5\u2032 ends of the primers used for PCR (see Fig. 1a).\n\n",

Initially, these use long-range PCR to amplify large fragments of the virus genome (possibly even encompassing entire genomic sequences). These PCR products are subsequently fragmented and cloned into plasmid vectors prior to sequencing and \u00adreconstruction of the viral sequence. Since this approach uses only two viral-specific primers (which can be targeted to highly conserved regions) and is not reliant on internal virus-specific primers, this method may provide a more suitable approach that has a broader sensitivity to different viral variants. However, these methods need to balance the advantages in diagnostic sensitivity that are gained from using a smaller number of primers with the drawback of lower analytical sensitivity that may arise from amplifying large PCR products (in comparison to shorter fragments).",

This method is simple and as such makes very few assumptions about the evolutionary process. However, certain features of genetic evolution of organisms present problems when using this method of tree construction. First, inaccuracies can occur as a result of the existence of homoplasy. Homoplasy describes processes, such as convergent evolution, by which a single mutation can occur twice on independent branches of a tree. Hence, it implies that two sequences sharing a mutation were not necessarily derived from a common ancestor that also contained this mutation. Another hurdle to overcome is back-mutation, by which a mutation reverts to its original genotype. This can cause the specific sequence to appear more ancestral than is necessarily the case. A further drawback to the method of maximum parsimony is that it takes no account of the rate at which mutations arise and the varying probabilities of different mutations occurring (i.e., transversions vs. transitions).",

With the sophisticated models such as the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model (28) and the general time reversible (GTR) model (29), an improved idea of phylogeny is achieved, although fitting an incorrect model can give incorrect results. The suitability of models can be tested using a program such as model test (30).",

However, the maximum likelihood method has a computing limitation for large numbers of sequences. To infer statistical confidence in either maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood, constructed phylogenies bootstrap analyses (31) are performed. A further method to infer phylogenies is that of Bayesian inference, which generates a posterior distribution for a parameter based on the prior for that parameter and the likelihood of the data (represented by the sequence alignment). In other words, whereas maximum likelihood analysis investigates the probability of the observed data given a specific evolutionary model, Bayesian inference looks at the probability that a model is correct given the observed data set. With the availability of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (32), Bayesian inference can be a preferred choice for tree estimation because it can be faster than maximum likelihood, and no bootstrapping is required as the posterior probabilities determine the statistical confidence in the tree.",

When studying closely related sequences over a short time period the likelihood of back-mutation is relatively low, and hence maximum parsimony tree construction is likely to give an accurate estimation of tree phylogeny. Phylogenetic analysis of virus sequences is often performed with the aim of tracing specific virus history, and in these cases the method of statistical parsimony can be used. The distances depicted by parsimony trees represent the actual number of differences between sequences, whereas for a maximum likelihood tree the probability of change is shown (Fig. 3\n).",

Although the statistical parsimony trees drawn by TCS are not bootstrapped, if the data comprise the complete genome sequences of the sampled viruses, then the tree is as accurate and as representative as it can be: It is not sensitive to the choice of a single arbitrary locus because there are no further genetic data retrievable.

            "text": "\nIn addition to ensuring that all solutions used for RNA extraction are RNase free, pipets and work surfaces should be cleaned using 10% bleach followed by DNAzap (Ambion) prior to and between each sample processed.A logical work flow for processing the samples for sequencing projects is highly recommended (see\nFig. 4 for an example). This is particularly important for high-resolution molecular epidemiological studies since the discrimination of samples may be dependent on the accurate determination of only a few nucleotide differences in the complete genome length (3). Therefore, it is important that care is taken to minimize cross-contamination between samples (particularly post-PCR products). If possible, samples should be processed independently (including suitable negative control material), and the study should be organized to attempt to maximize the differences between successive samples tested.\nA variety of sample types (including blood, tissues, esophageal-pharyngeal fluid, and cell culture supernatant) can be tested; however, it is usually preferable to test primary material (such as clinical samples) since it is possible that cell culture passage or molecular cloning of viruses can introduce nucleotide changes that can influence the interpretation of results.Once placed in TRIzol reagent, samples can be stored for extended periods (at a wide range of temperatures, \u221270 to +4\u00b0C).The requirement to perform a high number of downstream sequencing reactions may necessitate that a relatively large volume of PCR product is generated requiring pooling of RNA, cDNA, or post-PCR products. An additional practical consideration is the fidelity of the DNA polymerase used for the PCR amplification step; if possible proofreading enzymes that are widely available should be used.In common with other long PCR methods, the parameters of the protocol used for amplification of viral genomes should be optimized prior to routine use. Steps to be considered include the components of the RT or PCR mixes and the cycling times used for amplification. In initial experiments, a PCR targeting a fragment of the 5\u2032 end of the genome can be used to confirm that full-length cDNA has been produced in the RT reaction.In general, these methods provide an accurate estimation of the viral consensus sequence. However, it is important to recognize that this sequence will be a composite of the component variability that, to a greater or lesser extent, may be present. In spite of concerns that it is theoretically possible that the sequence generated will not represent an actual virus species present in the sample, studies with FMDV indicated that the majority of molecular clones have identical sequences to the consensus (\n37\n). Testing of duplicate samples can generate identical results (\n4), demonstrating that these methods are accurate, and as long as the viral concentrations are relatively high, consensus sequences obtained will mask any individual proofreading errors that might arise due to low fidelity of reverse transcriptase and polymerase enzymes. These aspects relating to accurate determination of the sequences of specific viral genomes (rather than consensus sequences) will be of particular concern in studies that aim to characterize the genetic population structure within samples (i.e., the quasi-species nature of a virus). New technologies and approaches (see\nSubheading\n3.5.) may be utilized to address these important questions that underpin our understanding of viral evolution.\n",
