Sequence variation must occur, however, without compromising functions essential for the completion of the viral cycle. RNA viruses are safeguarded in this respect by their genome carrying conserved information that does not code only for proteins but also for the formation of structurally conserved RNA domains that directly perform these critical functions. Functional RNA domains can interact with other regions of the viral genome and/or proteins to direct viral translation, replication and encapsidation. They are therefore potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarises our knowledge of the functional RNA domains of human RNA viruses and examines the achievements made in the design of antiviral compounds that interfere with their folding and therefore their function.",

            "text": "The appearance of viral mutants resistant to antiviral compounds is a major public health concern. The continuous generation of such mutants is a characteristic of RNA viruses, many of which, for example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and DENV (all with a single-stranded, positive RNA genome), cause serious diseases. The genome of RNA viruses acts both as a template for replication and as an mRNA. During replication, mutations are introduced into the genome via errors in the action of viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase; this can generate mutants that may greatly contribute to viral proliferation-although it can also lead to the disappearance of the virus if such changes leave it non-viable or induce acute pathogenesis in the host, the so-called error catastrophe (for reviews, see [1, 2] ). Viruses must, therefore, strive to reach an equilibrium that allows for adaptive fitness without compromising their persistence. To accomplish this, RNA viruses have developed an information storage system that does not code for proteins, but for specific, complex and highly conserved, folded genomic regions that play direct, functional roles in the viral cycle. These viral regions present an adaptive behaviour that has evolved with the selective pressure to achieve high genetic robustness [3] [4] [5] . As a result, mutations in viral RNA genomes present minor incidence in the functional elements [4] .",

The folding of these elements represents a highly conserved, compact structure that, via the so-called all-RNA-based mechanism, mediates the recruitment of the ribosome with no need of additional protein factors [17] . The IRES structure can be split into three domains (Figure 1 (a)), each defined by a PK motif (PKI-PKIII). This conformation is considered the 'prefolded' isoform of the IRES. Domain PKIII mimics the folding of the initiator transfer RNA (tRNA), allowing it to occupy the P and E sites of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This promotes structural changes in the IRES that finally allow the binding of the 60S particle and the efficient initiation of translation from a non-AUG codon [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Thus, the conformation of PKIII replaces the need for an initiator tRNA [23]. -Extended IRES with compact regions. The prototype of this group, the HCV IRES, folds as an extended region with tightly compact domains. It is mostly contained in the 5\u2032UTR of the RNA genome but also spans a short stretch of the coding sequence ( Figure 1(b It is tempting to propose that the induction of the IRES within the coding sequence is further modulated by long-distance RNA-RNA interactions with the 5\u2032UTR, thus promoting alternative conformations that might regulate its functioning [46] .",

            "text": "FRDs are needed in the 3\u2032 end of viral genomes to promote the efficient binding of the polymerase and the regulation of the elongation step during RNA synthesis [7, 12] . They are also important partners in the preservation of viral genomic stability and the control of processes mediated by the 5\u2032 end [47] . The latter is mediated by the establishment of a dynamic crosstalk between both termini of the genomic RNA. The sequence and 3D structure of the 3\u2032 cis-acting domains are quite diverse, even among members of the same taxon ( Figure 2 ), which must entail substantial differences in the mechanism of action if the same function is to be achieved. Such great complexity and variability preclude a detailed discussion of all the 3\u2032 RNA structures present in different RNA viruses; only those most extensively studied are therefore mentioned in the following. The genus Enterovirus includes human polioviruses, rhinoviruses and the human enteroviruses of groups B, C and D (which include different human coxsackieviruses). Their genomic RNA ends with the so-called oriR region, which is composed of a short, highly folded 3\u2032UTR (75-100 nucleotides) capped by a polyA tail [48, 49] . The oriR has been shown to play an important role in viral replication via its direct recruitment of viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase and host cell factors such as PCBP, the La autoantigen and eEF1A [15] . A common architecture at the 3\u2032UTR can be inferred for all the members of the same viral group (Figure 2 (a)). Thus, rhinoviruses have a single stem-loop (named Y), polioviruses contain two stem-loops (X and Y) and coxsackieviruses have three consecutive stem-loops (X, Y and Z) [48] . The presence of two or more stem-loops defines a typical PK motif involving the apical loops of domains X and Y [50,51]. This PK may regulate dynamic spatial rearrangements in domains X and Y that fine-tune viral RNA synthesis [52,53]. Despite sequence diversity, enterovirus 3\u2032UTR represents a good example of how RNA genome structure has diversified yet retains common essential functions.",

The region required for internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity is noted. The 3\u2032 end of the viral genomic RNA is organised into two structural elements: the CRE region and the 3\u2032 untranslatable region (UTR). (b) Foot and mouth disease virus RNA genome with the VPg viral protein bound to its 5\u2032 end. The IRES region is indicated. Binding sites for eIF4G and polyA binding protein (PABP) are shadowed. The circular form is stabilised by protein-protein (eIF4G and PABP, among others) and RNA-RNA interactions. (c) Flavivirus genome is capped at its 5\u2032 end (indicated by m7G) to ensure viral protein synthesis. The locations of the complementary sequences, cyclisation sequence (CS), upstream AUG region (UAR) and downstream AUG region (DAR), are marked by grey solid lines. The black solid lines indicate long-distance interactions (direct RNA-RNA and protein-protein contacts). Arrows denote the position of the start and stop translation codons. Pseudoknots (PK) are noted as described in Figure 1 tools. The constant appearance of sequence mutants resistant to current treatments has prompted the search for alternative targets. Structurally conserved regions involved in the progression of the viral cycle are excellent candidates. The combination of different compounds targeting multiple viral regions and processes might contribute greatly to reducing the appearance of resistant variants.

Therefore, highly conserved genomic domains are the most promising regions for targeting new nucleicacid-based antiviral compounds. Importantly, a number of aspects need to be taken into account in pursuing this goal [107] , such as the cellular uptake of the inhibitor, target and inhibitor colocalisation, the active inhibitor concentration inside the cell, the intracellular inhibitor stability and the access and binding to the target region. In recent years, great progress has been made in the field of nucleic acid treatment, and some of the aforementioned problems have been now successfully solved.

A different administration strategy is based on the intracellular production of unmodified antisense oligonucleotides. It requires gene therapy protocols to deliver the construct inside the cell. Its main advantage is that chimeric constructs encompassing different antisense sequences (or even different nucleic-acid-based inhibitors) can be produced, thus targeting multiple sites simultaneously.

Further modelling and crystal structure resolution provided a strong basis for the development of modified, high-affinity antivirals derived from aminoglycosides [148] and a more accurate view of the folding of the HIV DIS region [149] .

The chemical composition of these isosters makes benzimidazole derivatives excellent candidates for interaction with natural biopolymers. One of these derivatives, ISIS-11, has attracted much attention in recent years as a potential anti-HCV molecule. This compound specifically interacts with the basal portion of the IRES domain II, the so-called domain IIa [152, 153] . During the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal particle, domain II adopts an L shape that directs the apical hairpin loop IIb towards the 40S subunit E site, thus inducing a conformational shift that promotes the positioning of the start codon close to the active site. In the presence of ISIS-11, domain IIa acquires the shape of an open helix that alters the proper folding of domain II, thus impeding the correct positioning of the viral RNA in the catalytic binding cleft. These findings confirm the important principle of interfering with RNA folding to achieve an inhibitory effect.",

Such compactness, however, requires the intervention of a supracoding system (i.e. information in the genome beyond that of the nucleotide sequence) to direct the folding required; without such a supracoding system, no such compactness would exist, and essential functions of the genome in transcription, replication and encapsidation associated with this folding would be lost. Structurally conserved functional RNA elements interact with protein factors and other RNA domains to direct and regulate these functions as well as switch between different steps of the viral cycle. Interfering with the functioning of these structural domains offers a potential means of treating viral infections. The great advances made in the field of chemical synthesis and nucleic acid production have prompted novel initiatives involving small molecules that can alter the 3D conformation of viral genomic RNA domains. This might be used to complement classical antiviral therapies, such as the use of neutralising antibodies or interferon treatment. The combination of clinical strategies is currently under extensive investigation with the aim of improving therapeutic responses and longterm outcomes while minimising toxicity and secondary effects.

RNase H mediates the cleavage of the heteroduplex antisense deoxyoligonucleotide : target RNA. For non-DNA oligomers, inhibition is achieved by directing the oligonucleotides against functional regions of the RNA, such as those involved in the recruitment of the translational or replicative machinery. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) bind to the macromolecular complex RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which selects the guide strand that recognises the target sequence in the RNA of interest. This promotes the RNA degradation by specific endonucleases.
