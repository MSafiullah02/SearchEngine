However, reported cases of COVID-19 in Guangzhou City decreased continuously from week 6 to week 11 of 2020, when the local transmission of COVID-19 then ceased in Guangzhou City [Au?1]. There has since been a dramatic increase in cases; all of these have been reported to be imported cases (Figure 1E) [Au?1]. At the same time, the number of reported influenza cases showed a decreasing trend from the beginning of 2020, while there were two growth waves in 2019 during the same period (Figure 1F) [Au?1]. an analysis and found that the measures taken by the Chinese government to control SARS-CoV-2 also controlled the transmission of influenza virus, since these two viruses share the same routes and means of transmission: (1) nucleic acid testing was performed on all suspected patients, so the patients infected with influenza were also identified; (2) people were quarantined, therefore limiting the possibility of transmission of the infection to others; (3) social lockdown at the earliest onset of the outbreak meant that the possibility of transmission was even smaller; (4) the whole population were wearing facemasks, better protecting themselves from the infection; (5) there was extensive screening for fever cases, thereby reducing infection sources; (6) screening of close contacts of confirmed cases and suspected cases was performed, further reducing the number of infection sources [Au?1]. Thus, there would be a positive effect on influenza prevention and control, as well as on other infectious respiratory diseases, which may also have been prevented to some extent while fighting the pandemic of COVID-19.
