Problems associated with the management of infections in these patients include difficulties in early diagnosis because the clinical signs of infection are subtle, the low performance of diagnostic tests, and suboptimal response to treatment because recovery of host defenses is a key factor for resolution of infection. Preventing these infections relies on infection control measures and antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. While infection control measures are safe (but not always effective), the use of antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis of infection is not devoid of problems. Its wide use may increase the possibility of the development of resistance, select for resistant organisms, and increase toxicity and cost. Therefore, any attempt to administer an antimicrobial agent should be accompanied by a reflection of the potential benefits and risks of prophylaxis.",

Likewise, the shorter is the period at risk (and therefore the predicted duration of prophylaxis) the higher is the possibility that prophylaxis will work. However, the prediction of an incidence of infection is not simple, and requires an analysis of various factors including patient\u2019s prior exposure to pathogens, underlying disease, previous and current treatment, co-morbidities, geographic area and others. Therefore, three questions are critical in defining the appropriateness of antimicrobial prophylaxis: what is the risk for infection; what are the pathogens that predominate in this setting; and what is the period at risk.",

In addition, healthcare workers should also wash their hands between patients. All surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned, including wrists, palms, back of hands, fingers and under the fingernails, preferably with an alcohol-based hand rub [2]. However, if hands are visibly dirty or soiled with blood or body fluids, soap and water are best for cleaning hands [3]. Additional recommendations include the removal of rings prior to handwashing, keeping nails short and clean, and avoiding the use of artificial nails as they may carry pathogens [4].",

By contrast, a reduction in the incidence of IA was not observed in trials comparing itraconazole with fluconazole, and itraconazole was associated with more adverse events [45, 55]. A recent meta-analysis of itraconazole trials suggest that there is a reduction in Aspergillus infections but only if a certain threshold of bioavailable dosing is used [56]. Its ability to prevent invasive fungal infections has been associated with trough itraconazole concentrations >500 ng/mL, best achieved with the IV formulation (followed by the oral solution if the gastrointestinal function is intact).

Another RCT compared posaconazole to fluconazole in allogeneic HCT recipients who developed GVHD. Although the primary endpoint (incidence of invasive fungal infection from randomization to day 112 of prophylaxis) was not achieved, posaconazole significantly reduced the incidence of IA [59]. Micafingin given during the pre-engraftment period was associated with a trend suggesting ability to prevent aspergillosis.

These findings, however, should be balanced against our significantly improved ability for the early detection of fungal infections and the potential undesirable consequences including toxicities, drug\u2013drug interactions, costs, emergence of resistance [60]. The application of serial serum galactomannan monitoring has enabled us to make the diagnosis of IA much earlier, with a significant impact in reducing mortality [54]. Indeed, this strategy has been applied in a recently published RCT. In this study, allogeneic HCT recipients were randomized to receive fluconazole or voriconazole from conditioning until day  +  100 (or more, if patients developed GVHD). Different from previous studies, screening with twice-weekly serum galactomannan was part of the protocol in the two arms, and appropriate antifungal therapy was started based on positive galactomannan tests. In the primary endpoint (fungal-free survival) there were no differences between the two arms, but there was a trend for a lower incidence of IA in the voriconazole arm, with similar survival rates [46]. Therefore, these data suggest that giving an anti-mold agent as prophylaxis or giving fluconazole plus serial monitoring with serum galactomannan result in similar outcomes. Therefore, several factors should be taken into consideration in determining if prophylaxis is appropriate at a specific treatment center, for a given patient or patient population to target a specific infection or if prophylaxis should be withheld and a diagnostic-based preemptive strategy used instead.",

The application of preemptive therapy guided by serial monitoring with CMV antigenemia has markedly reduced the incidence of patients who develop overt manifestations and/or die of CMV pneumonia [71]. More recently, quantitative PCR for the detection of CMV DNA and CMV RNA have been introduced as alternatives for the antigenemia [72, 73]. Since these techniques are more sensitive than antigenemia, a threshold for starting preemptive therapy should be established for every group of patients; in other words, a specific number of copies of CMV DNA above which triggers the institution of preemptive therapy in allogeneic HCT may not be the same for patients with less severe immunodeficiency. Indeed, the application of these sensitive biomarkers has revealed that hosts not thought to be at risk for CMV reactivation may indeed have positive CMV PCR quite frequently [74]. Outside the setting of allogeneic HCT, patients at higher risk to develop CMV reactivation include patients with CLL receiving fludarabine or (especially) alemtuzumab [75], patients with multiple myeloma receiving highly intensive therapies [76], and autologous HCT recipients treated previously with rituximab [77].",

The time of initiation and the duration of prophylaxis should be individualized according to the underlying disease and type of treatment. For example, in ALL patients, prophylaxis is usually started at the end of the induction period and discontinued 3 months after completion of maintenance therapy; in HCT recipients it should be started after engraftment and continued as long as immunosuppressive therapy is ongoing, extensive GVHD is present and CD4 count is <200 cells/mm3. Alternative agents include: aerosolized pentamidine (given with Respirgard II nebulizer 300 mg every month after an initial loading dose given every other week), atovaquone suspension (1,500 mg/day), and dapsone (50 mg bid or 100 mg/day) [3].",
