Studies have shown that ambient ozone not only induces airway inflammation and decreases lung function but also associated with elevated mortality from and morbidity of respiratory disorders (Bell et al., 2004; Gryparis et al., 2004; Schwela, 2000).",

Three common ozone metrics have been used in regulatory (USEPA, 2012) and epidemiological studies (Bell and Dominici, 2008; Bell et al., 2004), i.e., daily 1-h maximum (O3, 1 h max), daily 8-h average maximum (O3, 8 h max), and daily 24-h average (O3, 24 h avg), representing different exposure time frames for health risk assessment. Concentration of ozone and the daily peak time of ozone formation are affected by traffic-related emissions; especially nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are considered a major precursor during ozone formation under strong sunlight. Therefore, total oxidant (Ox), which includes ozone and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), is a suggested alternative indictor of the health effects of ozone (Chou et al., 2006). Moreover, flux-based exposure metrics and exceedance of standard have also been used as ozone exposure indicators and to estimate the risk of ozone exposure for human health, plants and vegetation in Europe (Karlsson et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008; Musselman et al., 2006). Although many different ozone indicators have been used, no gold standard or criteria for selecting ozone metrics have been established, especially for health risk studies.",

Briefly, the O3, 1 h max was calculated as the average maximum hourly ozone concentration in the study area. The O3, 8 h max was the daily average of the maximum 8-h moving average. The daily 24-h average value was calculated by averaging 24 hourly measurements. Finally, the total oxidant was an alternative metric, including daily 24-h ozone and daily 24-h NO2 concentrations. We used Ox to measure the combined effect of ozone and NO2 because NO rapidly forms NO2 by reacting with ozone (Chou et al., 2006). All ozone metrics were obtained by averaging the 13 monitoring values to obtain an overall daily representative ozone exposure in Taipei. Pollutants with missing data of longer than 6 h were not used for that day. The quality assurance and control were performed and operated by TEPA (Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration, 2011). The Central Weather Bureau provided 24-h data from 25 real-time weather monitoring stations in Taiwan (Taiwan Central Weather Bureau, 2013). Hourly weather measurements (average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, relative humility, dew point temperature, water vapor pressure, and wind speed) were recorded at five weather stations in Taipei Metropolitan. Daily weather measurements from the Taipei weather station located in the city center were used because they were considered representative of the ambient temperature exposures of the local population. Meteorological data for daily average temperature, relative humidity (RH) and wind speed (WS) were also retrieved.",

Although O3, 1 h max and O3, 8 h max apparently have a stronger association with mortality rate compared to O3, 24 h avg in the cool season, the AIC value for the O3, 24 h avg model is the lowest among the three ozone metrics (Yang et al., 2012). Moreover, this study observed the significant positive association between levels of O3, 24 h avg and outpatient visits of total RD in the cold season (Fig. 2) imply that this ozone metric may be optimal for use in health risk association studies.

However, the associations between ozone exposure and morbidity from RD have proven inconclusive. A multi-city meta-analysis found that emergency hospitalizations for total RD could increase by 2.97% per 10 ppb increase in O3, 24 h avg in the elderly population (Ji et al., 2011). Some studies have also reported a significant association between ozone levels and hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma (Anderson et al., 1997; Ko et al., 2007a, 2007b; Lin et al., 2008; Sunyer et al., 1997). However, studies in Prague and Los Angeles showed no significant association between ozone and hospital admissions for RD (Hunova et al., 2013; Linn et al., 2000). In Metro Taipei, while outpatient visits for total RD is associated with ozone after adjusting for PM10 and NO2, the outpatient visits for asthma is associated with the combined effect of ozone and NO2 only in the cold season after adjusting for PM10. Our findings conflict with those of a Barcelona study, in which Ox is associated with the morbidity of COPD and asthma (Tobias Garces et al., 1998). However, because of depletion of ozone by NO, which is quickly oxidized by ozone to form NO2 in ambient atmosphere, total oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) is considered a better indicator for assessing the effects of both ozone and NO2 exposure (Chou et al., 2006). Ox appears the strongest association with outpatient visits for total RD in the present study. Therefore, Ox could be optional ozone metric for estimating health effects in metropolitan areas with strong sunlight and heavy traffic pollution.",

However, the risk of ozone on outpatient visits for total RD remains robust even after controlling for the potential effects of other air pollutants such as PM10 and NO2, meteorological conditions such as daily temperature, RH and WS, and respiratory tract infections and other potential confounders. Notably, the risk varies with the ozone metrics applied. This study agreed with previous findings that ozone metrics must be carefully manipulated when applying them to assess human exposure.
