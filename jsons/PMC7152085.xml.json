Most of the cases are due to viruses and evolve as uncomplicated disease resolving without specific treatment. The infection of the nasal airways determines an acute coryzal illness, traditionally referred to as a common cold, presenting with nasal discharge and obstruction, sneezing and sore throat. It is caused by a group of infections, all of viral nature, for the most part belonging to five families: rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus (especially coxsackievirus A21), and coronaviruses. Acute laryngitis is characterized by hoarseness of voice with a deepened pitch with possible episodes of aphonia. Often these signs are associated to those of coryza and pharyngitis. The large majority of episodes are due to viral agents, including parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. Bacteria, represented by C. diphtheriae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, may rarely play a role in this condition, and are almost invariably associated to pharyngitis. The acute inflammation of the pharynx causes the pharyngitis syndrome, which presents with soreness, scratchiness and irritation. Most cases are of viral etiology, and appear in the context of the coryzal syndrome or influenza, rather than as an isolated entity. Rhinovirus and coronavirus are the most common causative agents, but adenovirus and herpes simplex virus may also be implicated, usually in more severe clinical cases. Other viral causes of pharyngitis in the context of a generalized infection are Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The pharyngitis/tonsillitis syndrome is caused by bacteria in up to 15% of the cases, the most important agent being represented by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcus) and, more rarely, Corynebacterium diphtheriae.",

Comparison among studies, however, is difficult and differences are likely to reflect diverse diagnostic procedures and definition of syndromes rather than true epidemiologic differences. Still, RTIs consistently rank in the highest belt of most frequently diagnosed conditions. Incidence rates have been recently reviewed by Denny and Kallings, ranging from 4\u201342%.8 As they correctly point out, proportions made on a population group should be differentiated from those made on an ill group. A few additional reports have become available since the above review has been published. Among 1469 British package holiday tourists 7.6% had respiratory infection, and this condition was over-ranked by travelers' diarrhea only.9 Respiratory illness occurred in 26% of 748 travelers from the USA, second only to diarrhea.10 O'Brien et al. studied a group of 232 sick travelers at a tertiary hospital in Australia mainly returned from Asian destinations: RTIs were second after malaria, accounting for 24% of the cases.11 Leder and colleagues have found that 7.8% of ill travellers overall had respiratory illness in the GeoSentinel Surveillance System.12\n",

It is easily identified through the patient history and typical manifestations, no additional diagnostic procedures are required and symptomatic treatment provides quick relief. The diagnosis of laryngitis is clinical, and antibiotic treatment is not routinely envisaged. The diagnosis of pharyngitis is also clinical. It is important to differentiate group A streptococcal infections in this group of patients because this condition may determine late complications which are readily preventable by antibiotic treatment. Reportedly, bacterial pharyngitis is associated with more severe pharyngeal pain, odynophagia and higher fever, with grayish-yellow exudate on the tonsils and enlarged cervical lymphatic glands. However, clinical criteria are unreliable to identify bacterial pharyngitis/tonsillitis, because a typical presentation occurs in <50% of the cases. Rapid antigen detection tests are available with reported specificity of over 90% and sensitivity of 60\u201395%, and should be performed on initial evaluation on specimens collected by throat swab. The need to perform a bacterial culture if a rapid test is negative is still debated. Supportive care is the only therapy for the majority of cases which are due to viruses. Antibiotic treatment is warranted if the rapid test demonstrates streptococcal infection. Presumptive antibiotic treatment may be prescribed to cases when clinical suspicion of streptococcal infection is high and the clinical manifestations are severe, to be discontinued if the culture result is negative. A treatment course with penicillin for 10 days is appropriate to treat pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes. Diphtheria is a rare cause of pharyngitis, with potentially fatal outcome. It is characterized by thick and gray pharyngeal and tracheal membranes, bleeding upon attempted removal. Microscopic examination of direct stained pharyngeal smear is unreliable, and clinical suspicion of diphtheria must be confirmed by culture isolation of a toxigenic strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The mainstay of therapy is diphtheria antitoxin, associated with antibiotic treatment with penicillin or macrolides.",

A chest X-ray should be routinely performed, because the demonstration of an abnormal chest radiograph consistent with pneumonia differentiates a patient population that may benefit from antibiotic therapy from patient populations that will not (Fig. 57.2). Although the majority of cases with radiologic evidence of pneumonia may still have a viral infection, the proportion of cases due to bacteria is high enough to warrant systematic antibacterial treatment. The chest film is not helpful in making a specific etiologic diagnosis; however, lobar consolidation, cavitation and large pleural effusions support a bacterial cause. Pneumococcal disease is often characterized by abrupt onset of fever, cough, rapid respiration, and lobar consolidation on chest film. Atypical pneumonias caused by M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are characterized by gradual onset of symptoms, cough progressive from dry to productive, chest film worse than symptoms, and normal peripheral white blood cell counts. Overall, however, clinical presentation is not specific enough to make etiologic diagnosis, and effective methods to recognize the causative agent of pneumonia are not available. The sputum Gram stain is a simple, quick and inexpensive procedure but its helpfulness for aiding in the etiologic diagnosis is unclear. The main advantages are the identification of P. carinii in patients with AIDS or acid-fast bacilli in patients with tuberculosis. The utility of the sputum culture is also unclear, since the procedure is insensitive, only half of patients with pneumonia may produce sputum and contamination occurs in one third. An advantage of routine sputum Gram stain and culture is that these procedures would capture rare causes of pneumonia like melioidosis. Because the cause of pneumonia cannot be determined on the basis of any specific clinical, radiographic, or laboratory parameter, antibiotic therapy is usually begun empirically. Treatment should be effective on S. pneumoniae, the most frequently responsible agent, and on agents of atypical pneumonia: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and legionella infections. Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid should be associated with a macrolide. Alternatively, the new respiratory tract quinolones can be used alone. Presumptive treatment should be replaced by more specific treatment when a high degree of suspicion of the etiology of diagnosis is reached.",

In Table 57.7\nare shown influenza vaccine indications and considerations.18 Vaccination is a cost-saving intervention among the elderly and subjects with chronic cardiac and pulmonary diseases under influenza epidemic conditions, as it effectively reduces influenza-related morbidity and mortality.19 Special groups may be considered for influenza vaccination for reasons of convenience, such as athletes participating at the Olympic games. As a consequence of the 1998 epidemic of influenza in Alaska and the Yukon Territory, The National Advisory Committee on Immunization of Canada recommended influenza vaccination for people at high risk of influenza complications before embarking on travel to destinations where influenza was likely to be circulating.20 At the same time, some cruise lines initiated policies to vaccinate crew members to decrease the risk for influenza transmission to travelers.21\nSubjects who have received the influenza vaccine in the previous 6 months do not deserve to be re-vaccinated because specific antibody titers remain high for at least 6 months.22 Vaccination against H. influenzae (type B only) is now part of the childhood immunization program in many industrialized countries; its possible role in adult unimmunized travelers is unclear.

The overt picture of legionellosis is that of a lobar pneumonia with abrupt onset characterized by high fever, severe headache and confusion.42 Patchy infiltrates are often present bilaterally. Mortality may be as high as 20% if diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are delayed. Diagnosis is challenging because sensitive and friendly diagnostic tests are not widely available. Urine antigen tests are very helpful for rapid diagnosis, but they are not widely used as legionellosis is considered a rare disease. Serological diagnosis requires a four-fold or higher rise in antibody titers in paired acute and convalescent phase sera, and its usefulness is very limited in clinical terms. Isolation of the bacteria from respiratory secretions is possible but cumbersome; however, this is essential to apply molecular techniques to match patients' isolates with those of the environment, in order to provide evidence for clusters and the common source of the infection.

The consequence, confirmed by clinical trials, is that BCG effectively protects against a potentially fatal form of tuberculosis in infant and child populations only.67 Based on this knowledge, the vaccine cannot be recommended to adult travelers because of its unproven efficacy, but it might be administered to children <5 years of age who travel to TB endemic areas for periods of \u22656 months.",

Travelers acquiring the infection during travel may be identified by skin conversion in pre- and post-travel tests (Fig. 57.3\n). However, tuberculin skin testing and preventive therapy have several drawbacks of operational feasibility, lack of sensitivity/specificity, and poor adherence that will be discussed shortly. At present, the detection of tuberculosis infection is based on the skin reaction to the intradermal injection of M. tuberculosis antigens and detection of an area of induration (conventionally \u226510 mm) at 72 h. Skin-testing of travelers is useful only if the pre-travel test is negative and a post-travel test is conducted 3 months after returning home, to allow time for the immune system to mount a significant skin reaction in case of infection. This therefore requires at least two encounters with the traveler before and two after travel. The possible interference of the booster effect on the significance of a positive tuberculin test might even require two tests (four encounters) before travel,5 though this is considered unnecessary by most. Sensitivity and specificity of the tuberculin skin test are far from optimal. Rieder estimated that the positive predictive value of a positive tuberculin test with a basic prevalence of 2% is 16%, and is increased only marginally even by a 1% risk of infection during a travel.68\n",

Such tests may have advantages over the TST, in terms of higher specificity, better correlation with exposure to M. tuberculosis, and no cross-reactivity due to BCG vaccination and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. The role of these tests in clinical practice still needs to be defined.69\n",

Finally, the isoniazid chemoprophylaxis regimen is not effective against isoniazid-resistant strains, which now may represent from 5\u201310% of all strains in resource -poor countries. Because of all these drawbacks, Rieder has estimated that 14 travelers should be exposed to isoniazid treatment in order to eradicate a single case of latent infection.71 In summary, a universal strategy of tuberculin testing and preventive therapy for travelers cannot be advocated, at this moment, for both economic and epidemiologic reasons.",

The risk was limited to flights of over 8 h duration, and for the seats in close proximity to the index case. In fact, airplane-cabin air is exchanged every 3\u20134 min in contrast to the air in offices and homes, which is exchanged every 5, and 12 min, respectively. A laminar flow ventilation system is in place on airplanes, and despite modern airplanes re-circulating up to 50% of the cabin air, this seems not to disseminate small droplet nuclei.",
