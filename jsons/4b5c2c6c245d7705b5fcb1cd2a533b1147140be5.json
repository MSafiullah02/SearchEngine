Participants will be randomly assigned to eight, 1.5 h, group Zoom videoconference sessions of CT, MM, or AS. Mechanism and outcome variables will be assessed twice daily during the 2-week baseline, 4-week treatment period, and 4-week post-treatment epoch via random cue-elicited EMA; physical activity level will be monitored during these time epochs via daily monitoring using ActiGraph technology. Follow-up assessments of mechanism and outcome variables will be conducted at 3-and 6months post-treatment. The primary endpoint for the primary study aim (Aim 1) is the post-treatment pain interference score, operationalized as an average of pain interference ratings made on the twice-daily diaries during the first four days after treatment. The endpoint for the secondary study aim (Aim 2) is the post-treatment score at 28 days follow-up, as operationalized as the average of pain interference ratings on the diaries from the final four days of the immediate post-treatment follow-up period. All study procedures were piloted and developed in preliminary work by the investigative team. Specifically germane to this proposal, we have conducted numerous clinical trials examining psychological interventions based on the techniques investigated in this study for CLBP and other pain conditions [19] [20] [21] [22] , including telehealth assessment and treatment delivery [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . We have also published multiple studies examining treatment mechanisms and have a great deal of experience in implementing EMA, with compliance rates exceeding 85% [14, 15, 21, . This study is pre-registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03687762). The trial protocol follows Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [49] .

Zoom videoconferences allow participants to see and hear each other, and also allow screen sharing, giving clinicians the opportunity to display visual information (e.g., PowerPoint slides) during sessions. All participants will receive a treatment workbook specific to their treatment allocation to refer to during the group sessions as well as additional content to read between sessions.

The sample sizes needed to detect significant effects for each of these analyses is presented in Table 3 , using the tests for the three direct mediation effects of the mechanism variables for three of these analyses, and a test for the three Treatment Condition X Mediation (representing moderated mediation) effects for the other three analyses, assuming at least medium effects for each of these effects. Sample size estimates needed to detect the primary mediation effects were conducted based on the joint significance method of testing mediated effects, using the PowMedR program in R Version 3.0.2 statistical software with the following assumptions: (1) alpha levels consistent with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (see Table 3 ); (2) power of 0.80; and (3) at least medium effects. Power calculations for the interaction (mediated moderation) analyses were conducted using G*Power3 with the same assumptions. Thus, by employing the analytic models experiment-wise, and by integrating treatment-condition into the model(s) as an interaction effect (rather than running separate analyses for each treatment condition), we will be able to take advantage of the power afforded by running the entire sample of participants (n = 240) through the planned tests. This, combined with the less stringent Benjamini-Hochberg type-I error adjustment, has left us well-powered to detect the hypothesized effects if they exist. That said, we plan to enroll 300 participants with a goal of obtaining complete data for 240 participants (n = 80 per condition).",
