His ARV regimen consisted of darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg and lamivudine 300 mg once daily. Blood tests performed less than 2 months earlier showed an undetectable viral load (< 20 copies/mL) and a CD4+ count of 0.441 \u00d7 10^3/\u03bcL. He was also on maintenance therapy with doxazosin, metoprolole and amlodipine for arterial hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Chest x-ray evidenced a bilateral reticular interstitial thickening. No contacts with known cases of COVID-19 were reported by the patient but, considering the ongoing epidemic in Lombardy [4] , a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was performed retrieving a positive result. Darunavir/cobicistat was replaced by lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. In the following days, the patient's respiratory function quickly worsened despite Venturi mask and continuous positive airway pressure therapy and, one week after admission, the patient required mechanic ventilation. In the intensive care unit lopinavir/ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine were replaced by tocilizumab (two doses) and remdesivir (withdrawn for acute liver injury after 5 days) with improved respiratory conditions. At the last available follow-up (April 1), the patient is still inpatient with no fever and requiring only low-flow oxygen delivery.",
