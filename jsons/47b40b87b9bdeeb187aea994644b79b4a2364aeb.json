Further research should also focus on eventual technical treatments, including biosorbents and other materials to retain and/or inactive this and other pathogens circulating in these environmental compartments, before and after going out from wastewater treatment plants (in case of these treatment systems existing, as it could be worse, with spreading of untreated wastes). Some previous papers (such as those by Auffret et al., 2019; Hlongwane et al., 2019) could be considered as reference to program future studies. Also, the \"sewage epidemiology approach\" could be very useful, as this monitoring concept went from an initial focus on illicit drugs (van Nuijs et al., 2011) to the current view (also called \"wastewater-based epidemiology\"), covering a broad array of substances in wastewater, including virus particles (Daughton, 2020; Sims and Kasprzyk-Hordern, 2020) , and it would allow a drastic reduction in the time needed to develop a wastewater monitoring approach specifically designed for SARS-CoV-2 (Daughton, 2020) .",
