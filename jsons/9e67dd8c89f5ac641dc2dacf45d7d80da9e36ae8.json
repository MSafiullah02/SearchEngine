            "text": "While human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are well accepted as a major cause of common cold syndromes (rhinitis), their role in the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections is still controversial, and their detection in asymptomatic patients is relatively common. The HRV pathogenic role in four groups of hospitalized patients (pediatric immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, and adult immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients) was investigated by quantifying HRV load in nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage samples by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Real-time RT-PCR was performed in duplicate on all respiratory samples resulting positive by qualitative RT-PCR. In addition, molecular typing allowed detection of all known HRV species (A, B, and C). In immunocompetent pediatric patients HRVs were mostly associated with lower respiratory tract infections (in the absence of other viral agents) and wheezing, when viral load was !10 6 RNA copies/ml. In young immunocompromised patients (stem cell transplantation recipients), an inverse correlation between HRV persistence over time and time at which the infection occurred after transplantation was observed, whereas in adult immunocompromised patients (lung transplant recipients) HRVs could be detected at a medium-low level (<10 5 RNA copies/ ml) in bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken routinely from asymptomatic patients. In conclusion, when detected at high viral load, HRVs may cause severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections, whereas when detected at a medium-low viral load, an event more frequent in immunocompromised subjects, they may represent only bystander viruses.",

However, more recently, their pathogenic role has been repeatedly claimed in acute sinusitis of adults , acute otitis media of children [Pitkaranta et al., 1998] , and asthma exacerbations of children, adolescents, and adults [Nicholson et al., 1993; Johnston et al., 1995] . Furthermore, the pathogenic role of HRVs in lower respiratory tract infections of infants, elderly and immunocompromised patients has been reported. In more detail, 12.5% of viral pneumonia cases in neonates were attributed to HRVs [Abzug et al., 1990] , as well as 24% of community-acquired pneumonia cases in hospitalized children [Juven et al., 2000] , often in association with concurrent bacterial infections. In addition, HRVs are considered the second most common cause of bronchiolitis after RSV, often in association with RSV [Ong et al., 2001; Papadopoulos et al., 2002] . Furthermore, HRVs have been reported to be associated with hospitalization of children with a history of wheezing/ asthma [Miller et al., 2007] . In a prospective study covering a 3-year follow-up, first year wheezing caused by HRV was the strongest predictor of subsequent 3rd year wheezing [Lemanske et al., 2005] .",

Reverse transcription (RT) of viral RNA was performed with SuperScript\u00d4 II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a reaction mixture containing 5 ml extracted RNA (corresponding to 20 ml nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage), 10 ml 5\u00c2 buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8,3], 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl 2 ), 5 ml dithiothreitol (0.1 M), 1 ml Super-Script II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase, 5 ml deoxynucleoside triphosphate (10 mM), 2.5 ml random primers p(dN) 6 , and 21.5 ml nuclease-free water in a final volume of 50 ml. The RT thermal profile was: 10 min at 25 C, 50 min at 42 C, and 15 min at 70 C. Real-time PCR was performed on 10 ml cDNA (corresponding to 4 ml nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage), according to Deffernez et al. [2004] , in a final volume of 50 ml reaction mixture containing 25 ml TaqMan \u00d2 Universal PCR Master Mix, no AmpErase \u00d2 UNG (Applied Biosystems International, Foster City, CA), 900 mM forward, and 600 mM reverse primer, and 200 mM of each of the two probes. Primer and probe sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5 0 -GCACTTCTGTTTCCCC-3 0 ; reverse primer, 5 0 -GGCAGCCACGCAGGCT-3 0 ; probe 1, FAM-5 0 -AGCCTCATCTGCCAGGTCTA-3 0 TAMRA; probe 2, VIC-5 0 -AGCCTCATCGACCAAACTA-3 0 TAMRA. Thus, probe 1 (for HRV-A) was labeled at the 5 0 end with the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and at the 3 0 end with the quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethylrodamine (TAMRA), and probe 2 (for HRV-B) was labeled at the 5 0 end with the reporter dye VIC (Applied Biosystems, PE Europe, Basel, Switzerland), and at the 3 0 end with the same quencher dye TAMRA. DNA amplification was performed in 96-well microplates using the ABI PRISM \u00d2 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) according to the following thermal profile: 2 min at 50 C, 10 min at 95 C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95 C and 60 sec at 55 C. Each real-time RT-PCR test run included the amplification of two DNA scales (one per each probe) consisting of two linearized plasmids obtained by cloning two reference HRV serotypes (serotype 13 for probe 1, and serotype 3 for probe 2) with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). External standards were amplified from 10 6 to 10 1 DNA copies, allowing the construction of two standard curves, from which amounts of viral load present in clinical samples were extrapolated. Results were then multiplied by a factor of 250 (referring to 1.0 ml nasopharyngeal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage). Thus, negative results were indicated as <250 RNA copies/ml. The two curves were adopted in order to detect both HRV-A and HRV-B groups [Deffernez et al., 2004] . RT-PCR methods for HRV detection by Steininger et al. [2001] , as well as the RT-PCR for HRV molecular typing (based on phylogenetic analysis of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5 0 non-coding region of HRV and performed on the group of young oncohematologic patients only) according to Lee et al. [2007] were performed as reported. In experiment replicas, mean intraassay and interassay coefficients of variability were both less than 10% for the PCR assay (plasmid scales).",

Patients experiencing HRV infection within 60 days from the allograft showed a high viral load in the last nasopharyngeal aspirate sample tested, thus suggesting sustained viral excretion. In patients experiencing HRV infection >80 days after transplantation, HRV disappeared from nasopharyngeal aspirates within 1-2 weeks after onset of infection. However, in these patients, the peak viral load measured during the infection was not different in magnitude from viral load peaks observed in patients undergoing HRV infection in the early posttransplantation period. Three patients of this group were infected by HRV-C strains. One of these patients, who had received two Tcell depleted allografts for relapsed leukemia from the HLA-haploidentical mother, died 6 months after transplantation due to respiratory failure (hemorrhagic alveolitis). The patient had been infected by two different HRV-C strains, one detected in nasopharyngeal secretions upon transplant, and the other detected in bronchoalveolar lavage at the time of death.",

We found that a viral load greater than 10 5 RNA copies/ml in nasopharyngeal aspirate appeared to be associated with the presence of clinical symptoms either interesting the upper or the lower respiratory tract, while a viral load lower than 10 5 copies/ml was infrequently associated with clinical symptoms. Under experimental conditions, it has been shown that HRVs are able to grow in the lower respiratory tract, as demonstrated by their ability to grow both in vitro in primary human bronchial epithelial cells [Schroth et al., 1999; Papadopoulos et al., 2000] and in vivo in lower airway secretions following experimental infection by intranasal instillation and aerosols [Gern et al., 1997; Papadopoulos et al., 2000 ]. In addition, it was shown that in bronchoscopy samples, virus titers were similar to those observed in nasal brush samples [Halperin et al., 1983] . These findings support the assumption that virus quantitation in nasopharyngeal aspirates in lower respiratory tract infections mirror the virus amount present in the lower respiratory tract. Along this line of thought, it appears reasonable to attribute the etiologic role of a lower respiratory episode to HRVs, whenever a high viral load is detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients not shedding other viruses in respiratory secretions.",

Although it is relatively infrequent that two viruses are detected at a high concentration in respiratory secretions (>10 5 RNA copies/ml NPA), our experience indicates that more than the absolute value of viral load in the admission sample, the kinetics of viral load drop in association with improvement of clinical symptoms may discriminate, among two or three co-infecting viruses, the etiologic agent of a respiratory syndrome Gerna et al., 2008] .",

In two stem cell transplant recipients repeat bronchoalveolar lavage samples were HRVpositive at intervals of 31 and 44 days after first virus detection. This finding raised the possibility of prolonged lower respiratory tract replication [Ison et al., 2003 ]. In the present study, we were able to detect an inverse correlation between duration of HRV infection and time (days) elapsed after transplantation in a group of nine young stem cell transplant recipients who were followed for at least 6 months. This finding supports the recommendation, when feasible, to delay transplantation by at least 1 month, if HRV is detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates in the period preceding the beginning of the preparative regimen to the allograft. On the other hand, peak viral loads were not influenced by the time elapsed from transplantation. In the past, cases of respiratory failure along with HRV respiratory infection were either associated with a co-pathogen or attributed to chemotherapy/radiotherapy [Ghosh et al., 1999; Ison et al., 2003; Van Kraaij et al., 2005] . However, two cases of fatal lower respiratory tract infections in adult stem cell transplant recipients likely caused by HRV have been recently reported [Peck et al., 2007] . In our study, all patients, but one, survived HRV infection during follow-up. The case of a transplanted patient who succumbed to pneumonia following HRV-C infection underscores the potential severe pathogenic role of this newly identified group of HRVs [Lau et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007] .",
