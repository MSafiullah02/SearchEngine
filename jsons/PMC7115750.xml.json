            "text": "Although a peptide can bind strongly to a protein target and\neffectively block or regulate its activity, it is also prone to hydrolysis of\nits peptide bonds. Therefore over the last few years various research groups\nsearched for peptide bond mimics, analogues, substitutes, or isosters in order\nto obtain a molecule whose shape and electrostatic potential are very similar to\nthese of the parental peptide (see table 1 for detailed references). We generated here a set of molecules\nfor further virtual screening by substituting a peptide bond by its mimics.\nTable 1 presents various\nlinkages capable of substituting peptide bonds. Almost 40 moieties have been\ndescribed in the literature and some of them can be present in various\nstereoisomeric forms. The substitutes for a peptide bond can be grouped into\nvarious subcategories. For example with respect to the number of atoms\nseparating the groups connected initially by a peptide bond one can identify\nlinkages with one, two, three and more atoms. There is also a set of peptide\nbond substitutes where rings are involved in binding two groups of the parental\npeptide. In addition there is a group of molecules where side chains of amino\nacids are substituted by atoms forming ring structures that substitute both\npeptide bonds and some side chains. The set with one-atom linkages shorter than\nthe original peptide bond is composed of amine \u2013NH\u2013 and\nether \u2013O\u2013 bridges (Baker\net al 1992). The other set with three or more\natoms separating the two groups previously joined\nby \u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013 is larger. There are linkages where\nadditional\ncarbonyl \u2013CO\u2013(\u2013CO\u2013CF2\u2013CO\u2013 and \u2013CO\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013 (Thaisrivongs et al 1986,\nWatt 1986, Wolfe et al 1999)) or\nother \u2013O\u2013 (\u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013O\u2013), \u2013N\n= CH\u2013 (\u2013NH\u2013N = CH\u2013CO\u2013),\n\u2013CH2\u2013 (\u2013CH(OH)\u2013CH2\u2013NH\u2013)\nare inserted. In the set where rings are substituting peptide bonds one can find\nazaphosphinane rings (Grembecka et\nal 2003), cyclopropane rings (Martin et al 1992), pyrrole\nrings (Smith et al 1994),\nand thiazole rings (Singh et al\n2001), while in the group where ring structures substitute not only a\npeptide bond but also some amino acid side chains one can find para-substituted\nphenyl rings (Temple et al\n1998, Tyndall et al\n2000, Yin et al\n2005) and thiazolopyridine rings (Olson\net al 1993). The largest set is the one where\ntwo atoms are separating the two groups that had been connected by a peptide\nbond. It is easy here to identify a subgroup with a\u2013PO\u2013 group\ninstead of \u2013CO\u2013 in peptides (Bone et al 1991, Fraser et al 1992, Tsukamoto et al 1998, Collinsova and Jiracek 2000, Demange\net al 2002, Grembecka et al 2003),\nand \u2013SO2\u2013 (Langenhan et al 2001). There is a subgroup with a\nfluorine atom bound to a carbon atom (Thaisrivongs\net al 1986, Fraser\net al 1992, Silva\net al 1996, Volonterio et al 2003, Annedi et al 2005, Xiao et al 2005) and a subgroup where a\ncarbon\u2013carbon double bond substitutes a C\u2013N bond in peptide linkage\n(Lehman de Gaeta and Czarniecki 1989,\nJaskolski et al 1991,\nGardner et al 1995,\nZhang et al 1998,\nXiao et al 2005).\nThere is also the set with a carbonyl group in a peptide linkage reduced to a\nhydroxyl group (Kempf et al\n1990, Jaskolski et al\n1991). Other linkages include\nester \u2013CO\u2013O\u2013 (Amblard et al 1993),\nethylene \u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013 (Amblard et al 1993),\nand \u2013CH2\u2013NH\u2013 (Jaskolski et al 1991, Guichard et al 1994, 1995) substitutes, as well as\nretro-inverto-peptides (Guichard et\nal 1994, 1995,\nBeglova et al\n2000).",

For\neach molecule a vector of two-dimensional indices and their occurrence counts\nare calculated. The index represents a unique combination of three connected\natoms. Each atom is described by six parameters: atom symbol, charge, valence,\ntype of bond, and number of connected hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms.

The system developed enables a search for similar\ncompounds in the large (approximately a million commercially available\ncompounds) Ligand.Info meta-database (von\nGrotthuss et al 2004).

The best scoring compounds of the first set are original AG7\nligand (eHiTS docking score: \u22125.615), two versions of modified AG7 (with\nremoval of some parts of the original ligand AG7; eHiTS docking scores: \u22125.103\nand \u22124.803) and as the fourth/fifth scoring compounds, the original peptides\nof the SARS protease (1UK4, chains H and G) after improving the initial 3D structure\n(eHiTS docking scores: \u22124.795 and \u22124.703). The docking scores for the\nsecond group (ligands built by modification of the peptide bond) are in most cases\nlower than those in the case of the first group. The best scoring compounds in\ntable 3 are modified versions of\nAG7 (score \u22125.940), where the peptide\nbond \u2013CO\u2013NH\u2013 in the middle of the parental AG7 molecule\nwas substituted by\nthe \u2013PO2\u2013CH2\u2013 moiety, original AG7\ncompound (score \u22125.615), and VAS5 peptide, in which the two residues Leu and\nGln from the C termini were substituted by a thiazolopyridinone ring (modified\nversion with score \u22125.465) and ligand created from the original chain G\npeptide from the SARS CoV target, where the peptide bond between Ser and Thr was\nreplaced by an ether bridge (1UK4 with score \u22125.430).",
