Still in our cohort only 49% of patients reported a smelling dysfunction, which is 92 more than in a recently published survey [4], but significantly less in comparison to what was 93 diagnosed by the Sniffin' test . E.g. the magnitude of the olfactory dysfunction in COVID-patients 94 is underreported with more than 80% of COVID-19 patients having hyposmia or anosmia, in 95 comparison to the uninfected controls, where no participant was anosmic and 27% hyposmic. In 96 a large German community sample (n = 7267) a similar low percentage of anosmia (5%) has 97",

It is unclear 106 whether olfactory sensory neurons are directly involved in the pathogenesis of smelling loss in 107 COVID-19, since they have not been shown to coexpress Transmembrane protease, serine 2 108 (TMPRSS2) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which are central for entry of SARS-109 CoV-2 into human cells [7]. In fact, the detection of the expression of these proteins in coexpres-110 sion in olfactory sustentacular cells [7] does not preclude the direct involvement of olfacory sen-111 sory neurons in COVID-19 associated smelling loss. In a mouse model infected with another 112 human coronavirus, e.g. HCoV-OC43, viral antigen is detected only in the olfactory bulb after 3 113 and in the whole brain tissue after 7 days [8]. Given the wide distribution of the Angiotensin Con-114 verting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)-receptor in the brain [9], the observation that HCoV are able to induce 115 direct neuronal injury within brainstem cardiorespiratory centers in experimental animal models 116 [2] and the increasing evidence that SARS-CoV 2 is also causing neurological complications, the 117 clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients with deterioration at around one week and the acute 118 respiratory failure may be related to the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-Number of correctly identified odors. The Sniffin test uses 12 different odors; the 141 percentage of participants (y-axes; COVID-19 patients black bars; controls white bars) correctly 142 identifying the respective number (n, x-axes) of odors is shown. The dashed lines define the cut-143 off between anosmia, hyposmia, and normosmia according to the test guidelines [",
