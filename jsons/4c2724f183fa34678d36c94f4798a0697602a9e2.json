No major hemorrhage was noted. Neurological signs were sometimes seen in the late stages. Shock and multi-organ system failure, often with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, ensued in the second week, with death in four of the five cases. Distinctive treatment components of the one surviving patient included rapid commencement of the antiviral drug ribavirin and administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), N-acetylcysteine, and recombinant factor VIIa.",

VHF may be caused by more than 25 different viruses from four taxonomic families: Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae. Transmission of hemorrhagic fever viruses is through direct contact with blood and bodily fluids during the acute illness. Although patient isolation and specific VHF precautions (consisting of surgical mask, double gloves, gown, protective apron, face shield, and shoe covers) are advised for added security, experience has shown that routine universal and contact precautions are protective in most cases [1] . Aerosol precautions, such as the use of N95 particulate filters, are only recommended when performing specific potentially aerosol-generating procedures, such as endotracheal intubation.",

In 2008, an outbreak of a novel hemorrhagic fever virus called Lujo occurred in Johannesburg, South Africa, with secondary transmission from the index patient to four healthcare workers. Four of the five patients died. Lujo belongs to the arenavirus family and is only the second pathogenic arenavirus, after Lassa virus, to be recognized in Africa and the first in over 40 years. Because most viral hemorrhagic fevers occur in remote, resource-poor settings, few in-depth controlled studies of their clinical manifestations, transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, or response to treatment options are possible. We describe the clinical features of the five cases in this outbreak and summarize the clinical management, as well as providing additional epidemiologic detail.

The patient fell sick on September 2 (Illness day [ID]-1) with the abrupt onset of fever, myalgia, sore throat, and headache, for which she took over-the-counter antipyretics and analgesics. The next day she described nonbloody diarrhea and vomiting. A mild erythematous rash appeared on ID-5 on her chest and upper arms. Fever up to 39uC continued intermittently, escalating on ID-7, accompanied by retrosternal chest pain and worsening sore throat, after which she presented to a clinic in Lusaka (ID-8), where she was given broad spectrum antibiotics. By ID-9 the rash covered her entire body. Myalgias became more prominent and her face was noticeably swollen. Rapid deterioration occurred on ID-10 with progressive confusion and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

Surprisingly, the two viruses are genetically quite distinct (up to 38.1% on the nucleotide level), with Lujo virus grouping much closer genetically to Old World arenaviruses not associated with VHF [5] Lassa fever classically begins with non-specific signs and symptoms including fever, general malaise, headache, myalgia, chest or retrosternal pain, and sore throat with progressive diarrhea and other gastrointestinal involvement [7, 9] . Severe cases may progress to a capillary leak syndrome with septic shock, rash, facial and neck swelling, and multi-organ system failure. The facial and neck swelling seen in both LHF and Lassa fever appear to be specific to Old World arenavirus infection and may help differentiate it from other African VHFs. Like in Lassa fever (and despite the slight misnomer ''VHF''), major bleeding was not a prominent feature in the patients with LHF, although minor bleeding was common. The AST and ALT are typically elevated in Lassa fever, with AST much greater than ALT and high levels of AST associated with a poor prognosis [7] . This same pattern was seen in all five patients with LHF, with the only survivor manifesting the lowest peak AST and AST: ALT ratio. Some distinctive features of LHF relative to typical Lassa fever were the abrupt disease onset (typically indolent in Lassa fever) and the presence of DIC, which is generally not considered to be part of the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, although the matter has not been extensively studied [9] . Although rash is consistently seen in light-skinned persons with Lassa fever, for unknown reasons it is almost never seen in blacks. All of the white patients and one of the two black patients with LHF manifested a very prominent rash. Interestingly, the black patient without rash was HIV infected, suggesting that the rash of LHF may be immune mediated. Patient 5 also had relative bradycardia, an interesting finding given reports of depressed cardiac function in an animal model of arenavirus infection [12] .",

Although no specific exposures were reported and some degree of personal protective equipment was worn by all four secondary or tertiary cases, it appears that strict barrier nursing practices were not always maintained and full VHF precautions were often implemented late in the course of treatment, if at all. Furthermore, the four infected healthcare workers generally had very close and sometimes prolonged contact with the patient, including in closed settings, such as the medical evacuation flight of Patient 1, augmenting the possibility of exposure to blood and bodily fluids. They also performed procedures that are often considered to be high risk, such as endotracheal intubation, insertion of indwelling intravascular catheters, and dialysis. The transmissibility of other emerging viruses such as SARS and MERS coronaviruses has similarly been enhanced when such procedures have been performed [15] . In addition to the 4 secondary/tertiary cases, another 94 persons were identified as contacts and monitored, including support staff (kitchen, laundry, cleaning), laboratory and radiography technicians, and nursing staff. We did not categorize contacts in terms of risk at the time, but now estimate that at least 30 of these would be reasonably categorized as high risk.

The most detailed data are from Patient 5, who was the only patient for whom a specific diagnosis of VHF was considered and confirmed early in the course of disease. Despite receiving ribavirin at disease onset, Patient 5's clinical status deteriorated and her illness was severe and prolonged. Although these results could be interpreted as lack of efficacy of ribavirin against Lujo virus, this is unlikely considering the drug's proven efficacy in other arenavirus infections [8, [23] [24] [25] Of greater importance was probably the fact that ribavirin was administered orally for the first 6 days of treatment. Efficacy of oral ribavirin for arenavirus infection has not been definitively shown and, in light of the significant first-pass hepatic metabolism resulting in an oral bioavailability of only ,50%, it is unlikely that oral administration reliably reaches the minimum inhibitory concentration for arenaviruses in serum [26] Serum levels are undoubtedly further diminished by decreased gut absorption, vomiting, and diarrhea in these severely ill patients.",

Animal models of sepsis have suggested that statin drugs may improve outcomes in septic shock [32, 10] . Furthermore, a large, population-based cohort analysis in Canada showed reduced risk of sepsis in patients with cardiovascular disease who were treated with statins [11] . Patient enrolment is currently ongoing for prospective trials of statin therapy after the development of sepsis. N-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant and free radical scavenger that resulted in decreased nuclear factor-kB and interleukin-8 in patients with sepsis, suggesting a blunting of the inflammatory response [28] . Recombinant factor VIIa is a prohaemostatic agent thought to act at the local site of tissue injury and vascular wall disruption by binding to exposed tissue factor to promote generation of thrombin and platelet activation. [29] . The drug has been used in hemophilia and other coagulation disorders, as well as in liver disease, reversal of anticoagulant therapy, and for episodes of excessive or life threatening bleeding related to surgery or trauma [30, 31] . Other therapies being explored for sepsis and, in some cases specifically for VHF, such as the recombinant inhibitor of the tissue factor/factor VIIa coagulation pathway, rNAPc2, and activated protein C, were not used in this outbreak due to lack of availability and/or risk of bleeding. The seemingly counterintuitive use of anticoagulants like rNAPc2 stemmed from work with an Ebola virus animal model to ameliorate the effects of tissue factor resulting in DIC [21] .",

Although hemofiltration has been suggested in patients with refractory hemodynamic septic shock, with a significant decrease in ICU mortality in responders [33] , and plasmapheresis appeared to have a brief positive effect in Patient 2, we are reluctant to advocate treatments or procedures that potentially increase healthcare worker exposure to blood. In fact, one explanation for the high secondary attack rate associated with this outbreak could be that such high-risk procedures were frequently undertaken. Many of the drugs employed in the management of Patient 5 are already clinically approved. Investigation of many of these compounds in animal models of VHF is warranted, including in LHF model using strain 13/N guinea pigs [34] . Ideally, controlled clinical trials in humans would also be undertaken, although the feasibility of this is dubious for most VHFs, with the possible exception of Lassa fever, for which many infections occur across West Africa, or perhaps through a ''multicenter'' approach through advanced planning with Ministries of Health and other partners in endemic areas for VHFs [35, 36, 21] . Until controlled efficacy data are available, and considering the high CFR often associated with VHF, we feel that it is both logical and ethical to explore the use of these approved compounds in treatment of patients with VHF when possible. Treating clinicians should make a concerted effort to collect and publish detailed, repeated, and systematic clinical observations to facilitate objective evaluation of their efficacy.",

Pathogenic arenaviruses will almost certainly continue to be discovered. Furthermore, rapid population growth, especially in Africa, and incursion for both economic and leisure activities into natural habitats harboring rodents will likely put humans at risk. The clinical findings and management experience reported here will be of use to clinicians faced with patients with arenavirus infections and as well as other VHFs. The day of illness that the value was noted is in parentheses. *Patients 1, 2, and 5 received transfusions of packed red blood cells, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma during the course of their illnesses.
