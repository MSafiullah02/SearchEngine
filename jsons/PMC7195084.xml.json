UN member states have pledged that \u201cno one will be left behind\u201d. The global response to COVID-19 must honour this pledge. Social conditions make it difficult for the vulnerable to change behaviours.

A theory of change is necessary to describe how inputs (eg, government messaging) should lead to activities (eg, people adjusting to working alone) that will lead to outcomes (eg, fewer physical contacts) to reduce the spread of the virus. Social and behavioural theory is relevant here, to complement the epidemiological theory in the models.",

Decision makers from all sectors, at all levels, should be supported to design, implement, and evaluate combination prevention approaches to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Finally, LMICs will need to be supported to strengthen the entire health system as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goal Agenda. A wave of public health action and evaluation built on these principles should be launched immediately.",
