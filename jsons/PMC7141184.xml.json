            "text": "A large family of viruses, called coronaviruses, are severe pathogens for human beings, which infect respiratory, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and neurologic diseases. They are distributed among humans, birds, livestock, mice, bats, and other wild animals [1,2,3]. The outbreaks of two previous coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in 2003 and 2012, respectively, have approved the transmission from animal to animal, and human to human [4]. In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) received notifications from China for many cases of respiratory illness that were linked to some people who had visited a seafood market in Wuhan [5]. Currently, Wuhan city suffers from the spreading of a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19 (previously, it was called 2019-nCoV). In [6], the authors concluded that COVID-19 likely originated in bats, because it is more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains. However, the source of the COVID-19 is not confirmed yet, and it requires more investigation. Most of the reported cases are in Wuhan city; therefore, at 10:00 a.m. on 23 January 2020, Wuhan was put on lockdown, in which no people were allowed to go in or out, so, the authorities stopped all public transportation, including airports, trains, metro, and public buses to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, several cities in Hubei province were put on lockdown. However, many confirmed cases have been recorded in other Chinese cities and about 24 countries globally (up to 3 February 2020) but less than Wuhan city. On 30 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the human to human transmission of COVID-19. According to the CDC, the virus can be spread by the air, close personal contact, touching surfaces, or objects that contain viral particles, and rarely from fecal contamination. One of the serious problems of the COVID-19 is its incubation period which is up to 14 days as mentioned by [7], and during this period it can spread to others. Moreover, in [8], a Chinese team concludes that the median incubation period is 3 days and it ranged from 0 to 24 days, and the median age is 47.0 years. Therefore, the confirmed cases have increased daily, specifically in China. The spread of such a virus is very dangerous and requires more strict policies and plans, which have already been implemented in many Chinese cities, especially in Hubei province. Thus, it is very critical to forecast the confirmed cases in the upcoming days to enact the necessary protection plans.",

They concluded that the number of unreported cases resulted in 469 cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. In addition, they estimated that after 17 January 2020, the cases had increased 21-fold. Nishiura et al. [10] proposed an estimation model for the infection rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China using the data of 565 Japanese citizens who had been evacuated from Wuhan from 29 to 31 January 2020. They conclude that the estimated rate is 9.5%, and the death rate is 0.3% to 0.6%. However, the number of Japanese citizens who had been evacuated from Wuhan is small and insufficient to estimate the infection and death rate. Tang et al. [11] proposed a mathematical model to estimate the transmission risk of COVID-19. They concluded that the basic reproduction number could be 6.47. They also predicted the number of confirmed cases in seven days (23 to 29 January 2020). Moreover, they expected that the peak would be reached after two weeks (from 23 January 2020). In [12], data of 47 patients were used to estimate sustained human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The author concluded that the transmission is 0.4, and if the time of symptom to hospitalization is half of the tested data, the transmission will be only 0.012. In [13], the authors presented an estimation model for the risk of death from COVID-19. Their estimation results for two different scenarios are 5.1% and 8.4%. They also estimated the reproduction number for both two scenarios as 2.1 and 3.2, respectively. The estimation results showed that the COVID-19 might cause a pandemic.",

[14] proposed a compartmental model to forecast spillover transmission risk and human West Nile virus (WNV) cases. The proposed model was applied using the historical data of WNY outbreaks of Long Island, New York, for 2001\u20132014. In [15], a comparison of several time series forecasting models is proposed to forecast hepatitis A virus infection. The authors used 13 years of data of Turkey to test four time series forecasting models, namely multi-layer perceptron (MLP), time-delay neural networks, radial basis function (RBF), and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The comparison outcomes showed that the MLP outperformed other models. In [16], the authors proposed a forecasting model based on ensemble adjustment Kalman filter for seasonal outbreaks of influenza. They evaluated the proposed model using the influenza seasons data of New York City for six years (2003\u20132008). In addition, Shaman et al. [17] proposed weekly forecasts for seasonal influenza based on susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible, ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, and influenza-like illness. Moreover, in [18], the authors employed a dynamic model with Bayesian inference to forecast the outbreaks of Ebola in several African countries, namely, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Massad et al. [19] proposed a mathematical model to analyze and forecast the infection of the SARS epidemic. They concluded that the reproduction number for two different communities, Hong Kong and Toronto, were 1.2 and 1.32, respectively. Ong et al. [20] proposed a monitoring and forecasting model for influenza A (H1N1-2009). Furthermore, Nah et al. [21] proposed a probability-based model to predict the spread of the MERS.",

            "text": "The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) [22] is widely applied in time series prediction and forecasting problems, and it showed good performance in many existing applications. It offers flexibility in determining nonlinearity in the time series data, as well as combining the properties of both artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic systems. It has been applied in various forecasting applications, for example, in [23], a stock price forecasting model was proposed using ANFIS and empirical mode decomposition. Chen et al. [24] proposed a TAIEX time series forecasting model based on a hybrid of ANFIS and ordered weighted averaging (OWA). In [25], another time series forecasting method was presented for electricity prices based on ANFIS. Svalina et al. [26] proposed an ANFIS based forecasting model for close price indices for a stock market for five days. Ekici and Aksoy [27] presented an ANFIS based building energy consumption forecasting model. More so, ANFIS is also applied to forecast electricity loads [28]. Kumar et al. [29] proposed an ANFIS based model to forecast return products. Ho and Tsai [30] applied ANFIS to forecast product development performance. However, estimating ANFIS parameters is a challenge that needs to be improved. Therefore, in previous studies, some individual swarm intelligence (SI) methods have been applied to the ANFIS parameters to enhance time series forecasting because these parameters have a significant effect on the performance of ANFIS. The SI methods include the particle swarm optimization (PSO) [31,32], social-spider optimization [33], sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) [34], and multi-verse optimizer (MVO) [35]. For example, in [34] SCA algorithm was applied to improve the ANFIS model to forecast oil consumption in three countries, namely, Canada, Germany, and Japan. In the same context, in [35], The MVO algorithm was used to enhance the ANFIS model to forecast oil consumption in two countries. In addition, in [36] the PSO was used with ANFIS to predict biochar yield. However, individual SI algorithms may stock at local optima. Therefore, one solution is to apply hybrid SI algorithms to avoid this problem. In [37], a hybrid of two SI algorithms, namely GA and SSA, was presented to improve the ANFIS model. The proposed new model called GA-SSA-ANFIS was applied to forecast crude oil prices for long-term time series data. However, the previously mentioned methods suffer from some limitations that can affect the performance of the forecasting output such as slow convergence and the ability to balance between exploration and exploitation phases can influence the quality of the final output. This motivated us to propose an alternative forecasting method dependent on the hybridization concept. This concept avoids the limitations of traditional SI techniques by combining the strengths of different techniques, and this produces new SI techniques that are better than traditional ones.",

Then the quality of each solution is calculated using the fitness value, and the solution that has the best fitness value is chosen to represent the best solution. Then the probability of each solution is computed. Then the current solution will be updated, either using global or local strategy in FPA. However, in the case of local strategy, the operators of SSA or FPA will be used according to the probability of the fitness value for each solution.
