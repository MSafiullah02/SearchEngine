Acute respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrhea, malaria and tuberculosis are the biggest infectious killers in the world and particularly in Africa.

Thus, DALY is thought of as one lost year of healthy life (WHO, 2003b) (Table\n32\u20102).\n",

Curiously and fortunately, all the studies conclude that a large part of the disease burden can be avoided by preventive and curative strategies. According to a series of studies published recently by the Lancet, 80% of the 35 million deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases in 2005, occurred in low-income and middle-income countries. Achievement of the global goal of reducing chronic disease death rates by 2% every year would save billions of dollars and avert 36 million deaths between 2005 and 2015 mainly in developing countries (Abegunde et al., 2007). A report of the World Bank, concentrating on the economic benefit of tuberculosis control in the 22 countries with the highest burden of TB, has shown that, moving from no DOTS to sustained DOTS in a global plan strategy between 2006 and 2015, will yield a benefit of US$ 129 billion quasi-totally in developing countries (Laxminarayan et al., 2007). Similarly, the impact of HIV/AIDS and other diseases on economic and human development was considered by several authors (Boutayeb, 2006; Dzenovska et al., 2005; UNAIDS, 2006).",

An estimated 17.5 million deaths were caused by these diseases in 2005, representing 30% of all deaths occurring in the world. Ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease together, caused more than 13 million deaths, whereas hypertensive and other heart conditions were responsible for an additional 4 million deaths. If the present trend is not reversed or at least stopped, some 20 million people will die from CVDs by 2015. Once associated with rich and industrialized nations, CVDs are now seriously affecting developing countries. Nearly 80% of CVD deaths occur in developing countries where they are expected to be the leading cause of death by 2010. In some countries of the East Mediterranean Region 40% of all deaths are caused by CVDs (Alwan, 1997; Boutayeb and Boutayeb, 2005; Tazi et al., 2003). Among the 20 \u201clucky\u201d million people who survive annually heart attacks and stroke, a number of \u201cunlucky\u201d survivals are living in developing countries where they cannot afford the continuing costly treatment and clinical care. Beyond mortality figures, CVDs are also imposing a huge disease burden. More than 85% of the global CVD burden happens in developing countries. In general, theses diseases strike people in their mid-life years, affecting their productivity, undermining the family budget and impeding the economic and human development of the whole society. Moreover, studies have shown that lower socio-economic groups have greater 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_6417 of risk factors, higher 10.1007/978-0-387-78665-0_5892 and higher mortality (Reddy, 2002; Yusuf et al., 2001).",

While the incidence and prevalence of some sites of cancer such as breast and cervical cancer have regressed in developed countries, they still have devastating consequences in developing countries mainly due to late detection. Other types such as lung cancer are exponentially exploding as a consequence of increase in the use of tobacco and alcohol. Finally, many types of cancer such as colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are \u201cflourishing\u201d in developing countries due to the multidimensional transition, in which most developing countries are completely or partially engaged, and its corollaries on inadequate diet and physical inactivity (Boutayeb and Boutayeb, 2005).",

According to the World Health Organisation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease causes 2.5 million deaths and some 25 million DALYs every year. Despite its chronic nature affecting some 600 million people, and the fact that it is the fifth and sixth leading cause of death in high and low- income countries respectively, COPD is thought to be overlooked, under-diagnosed, under-treated and under-funded, and also neglected by the public, pharmaceutical industry and physician alike when compared to other major killers such as cardiovascular disease and stroke (The Lancet, 2007). If urgent and efficient actions are not taken, COPD will be the third leading cause of death by 2020. This exponentially growing trend is partly explained by the ageing of the world\u2019s population and the sustained use of tobacco, which is the most important risk factor for this disease (Buist et al., 2007). Different authors have attempted to quantify its incidence, prevalence and global burden.",

More than 80% of the 50 million affected by epilepsy live in developing countries. It is thought that at least 70% of people affected can be seizure-free if treated with antiepileptic drugs. However, the vast majority remain untreated (in Africa, 80% receive no treatment). More generally, cost-effective treatments can be made available for most disorders but at least two-thirds of people who are mentally ill receive no treatment (Thornicroft, 2007). The reader can find more details in the series of articles devoted by Lancet in its volume 370 to mental disorders under the title \u201cwhy do we invest so little in our mental health care?\u201d. Mental illnesses are affecting developed and developing countries alike. However, due to lack of budget and human resources, the impact is more pronounced in low and middle-income countries where neglected mental illnesses are causing important economic costs and impeding human development.

On top of natural catastrophes, poverty, wars and conflicts, these countries are exposed to a double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases with alarming trends. Some diseases like tuberculosis are both causes and consequences of poverty. Other diseases like diabetes and cardio vascular diseases are more associated with different transition forms (demographic, economic, geographic and epidemiological) in which middle income countries are engaged. Globally, however, the double action of communicable and noncommunicable diseases constitute serious impediments to economic development by reducing productivity, setting aside saving possibilities and slowing economic growth in general. They also obstruct human development by their negative action on life expectancy, education and socio-economic status in general. The economic cost of care for noncommunicable diseases such as CVDs, diabetes, COPD and cancer is huge. The adequate treatment for communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria is beyond the capacity of most developing countries. In the main time, diseases are causing the loss of billions of dollars in terms of non productivity, absenteeism and skill. The global disease impact has a special feature in developing countries since most of the diseases affect either children or adults in their most productive part of life. Consequently, life expectancy, education, income and all human development components are affected by communicable and/or noncommunicable in developing countries. The disease burden is a major problem for health public and a real global concern for the whole economic and human development (Malawi, 2005; South Africa, 2003; UNESCO, 2007; UNICEF, 2005; Zimbabwe, 2003).",

It generally affects people aged 40 years and plus, generally treated with diet and tablets.Type1 diabetes is characterized by a total lack of insulin due the destruction of beta cells producers of this vital hormone. This type of diabetes affects children and young adults, for this reason it is also called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes. It\u2019s treatment necessitate the daily injection of insulin.Hyperglycemia occurs when the blood sugar is higher then the usual threshold. It indicates the onset of diabetes and/or its bad control in known diabetic people.Hypoglycemia is the state where blood sugar is lower than the normal concentration which is around one gram per liter or 6 mmol.In 2007, about 300 billion US$ (215\u2013375) were spent worldwide in care for diabetes and its complications.Body Mass Index (BMI) is the ratio given in kg/m2 and obtained by dividing the weight of a person by the square of its height. A person is said to be obese if its BMI is greater than 30 kg/m2.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes 2.5 million deaths and some 25 million DALYs every year.An estimated 17.5 million deaths were caused by CVDs in 2005, representing 30% of all deaths occurring in the world.In 2000, 53% of the 10 million new cases and 56% of the 7 million deaths caused by cancer, occurred in developing countries.Directly Observed Therapy Strategy (DOTS) is the most efficient strategy so far to control tuberculosis and limit its burden.\n",
