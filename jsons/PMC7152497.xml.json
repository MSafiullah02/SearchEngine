            "text": "Despite failing to uncover a specific pathogen in most case series, acute bronchitis is believed to be most commonly caused by a wide range of viruses (Table 66-1\n). Approximately 10% or less of cases are attributed to bacterial pathogens, principally Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. However, the recent increase in pertussis cases among adolescents and adults should be considered when evaluating illnesses. The relative proportion of cases caused by different pathogens varies according to age and the season studied but, importantly, is also influenced by the diagnostic methods used. Molecular tests, rather than standard culture, identify a greater number and wider range of viral pathogens, especially in adults, in whom many illnesses represent reinfection with common pediatric viruses (RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza viruses) or infections with newly discovered pathogens such as parainfluenza 4 and bocavirus.5, 6, 7, 8 Many of these infections in adults are associated with low virus shedding.6, 7 Furthermore, at presentation to a physician, virus shedding may have already ceased. Influenza A and B viruses are most closely associated with winter outbreaks of acute bronchitis in both children and adults because of a high relative incidence of infection and the efficiency of influenza virus to infect and damage bronchiolar epithelial cells.3, 8, 9, 10 Although cough associated with most coronavirus and rhinovirus infections is commonly caused by postnasal congestion, these agents, including recently identified strains of rhinovirus and coronavirus, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, can infect the lower airway, causing acute bronchitis.11, 12, 13, 14 The higher temperature of lower airways was considered inhospitable to rhinovirus replication; however, recent evidence has convincingly documented virus presence in bronchiolar epithelial cells, although cytopathology is less than that with influenza virus infection.13 Although found less frequently than other viruses in the general population, adenoviruses, including the recently identified adenovirus type 14, and adenovirus types 4 and 7, are important causes of bronchitis in military recruits.8, 15 Enteroviruses, primarily echovirus and coxsackievirus, can cause acute bronchitis. Simultaneous infection with two or more viruses occurs in 10% to 30% of cases, as is frequently the case with bocavirus infection. Worldwide, measles virus remains an important respiratory tract pathogen causing cough during the early prodromal phase; especially vulnerable are malnourished children in developing countries lacking resources for vaccination.16 Although herpes simplex virus is commonly identified in respiratory secretions of patients with respiratory illness and is generally considered to be clinically insignificant, it has been associated on occasion with acute hemorrhagic tracheobronchitis in normal persons and has been described in critically ill intubated adults.17 Although occasionally involving the lower airways, infection with human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 produces symptoms of hoarseness, stridor, and chronic cough.18\n",

Recently, Bordetella holmesii has been recognized as a cause of pertussis syndrome (see Chapter 232). In a recent acellular pertussis vaccine trial in adults, the incidence of pertussis was 0.7% in the placebo group.19 However, the number of cases in adults has been increasing in recent years, attributed to incomplete vaccine uptake as well as failure of the vaccine to induce durable immunity.20 This has resulted in a recommendation to provide a vaccine booster dose to adults and pregnant women (see Chapter 321). Bordetella bronchiseptica, a canine pathogen, can occasionally cause disease in humans, especially those who are immunocompromised.21\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (formerly Branhamella catarrhalis) have not been conclusively demonstrated to cause acute bronchitis, despite their implication in postviral pneumonia and chronic bronchitis. Although many viruses enhance bacterial adherence to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro, the actual incidence of postviral bacterial infection in clinical situations has not been well defined.",

Early after infection with influenza, type I interferons, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 can be detected.26 In experimental influenza virus infection, symptoms correlate temporally with the kinetics of cytokine secretion.27 Cytokine induction by rhinovirus may also explain the important role that this virus plays in asthma episodes.28 The immune response is thought likely to be responsible for the prolonged airway hyperreactivity that can be demonstrated for up to 6 weeks after influenza or RSV infection in normal adults.29 Among the bacterial causes of acute bronchitis, B. pertussis is unique in that its expression of toxins may play a role in clinical symptoms, including the prolonged characteristic cough.

During community outbreaks of influenza, the presence of an acute illness with fever and cough can have a predictive value of 79% in young healthy persons.32 Among hospitalized older persons with acute respiratory tract illness, similar clinical parameters increase the odds of influenza approximately threefold.33 Exposure to environmental irritants should be sought, especially in the absence of typical upper respiratory tract symptoms.

M. pneumoniae, with an incubation period of 7 to 21 days, will progress slowly through the family in contrast to influenza with its 2- to 4-day incubation period and close clustering of illnesses.

Similarly, one report described bacteremic S. pneumoniae pneumonia in long-term care patients after antecedent parainfluenza virus infections.35 Despite concerns about postviral bacterial pneumonia, several large studies have indicated that only approximately 7% of patients diagnosed with acute bronchitis will have radiographic evidence of pneumonia.36 Combinations of signs and symptoms or overall clinical judgment is imprecise, with a sensitivity of only 23%.37, 38 One study has found that in the absence of any vital sign abnormality, radiographic evaluation could be safely omitted.37 Standard laboratory tests, such as white blood cell count or inflammatory markers such as serum C-reactive protein, do not reliably discriminate viral from bacterial infection.38 However, recent studies from Europe have suggested that a serum procalcitonin level below 0.1 ng/mL may be a more reliable indicator of patients with a variety of acute respiratory syndromes, including acute bronchitis, that do not require antibiotic therapy.39, 40 Procalcitonin, the prohormone of calcitonin, is synthesized by a variety of tissues in response to bacterial infection to a greater extent than to viral infections.",

Acute bronchitis and other acute respiratory syndromes (otitis media, sinusitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections) account for approximately 75% of ambulatory prescriptions in the United States.1 Current guidelines, endorsed by a number of national societies, including the Infectious Diseases Society of America, do not recommend the routine use of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise normal persons.47 Various strategies to reduce antibiotic use, including patient and physician education or delayed prescription filling, can reduce antibiotic use by approximately 50%.48, 49 Recent randomized controlled studies using levels of serum procalcitonin to guide therapy in acute respiratory infections, including acute bronchitis, have also demonstrated that antibiotic use can be partly reduced without adversely affecting outcome.39, 40 If a specific viral diagnosis can be confirmed using a rapid RT-PCR test, perhaps physicians would be more willing to forego antibiotic treatment. Even patients with documented M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae infection may not benefit from specific therapy with macrolides or quinolones in the absence of pneumonia.
