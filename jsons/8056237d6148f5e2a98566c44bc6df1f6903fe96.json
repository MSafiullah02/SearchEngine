This therapeutic approach of specific targeting with short-chain nucleic acid molecules is known as oligonucleotide therapy. Although fomivirsen, the first such therapy, was introduced for the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in 1998, it was not commercially successful, being soon superseded by highly active small-molecule antiretroviral drugs. However, recent developments suggest that there is now a clearer path to success. 13 The high degree of personalization of therapy using this approach is illustrated in a recent report of the management of a rare genetic neurodegenerative disease, from diagnosis to synthesis and evaluation of a new oligonucleotide therapy in a single-patient (N of 1) trial. 14 Several new oligonucleotide therapies have been licensed over recent years for similar highly specific therapeutic targeting. These include mipomersen for homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in 2013, eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and nusinersen for spinal muscular dystrophy, both in 2016, and golodirsen in 2019 for the same condition. As their approvals were based on short-term trials with a limited number of patients, the true worth of those agents is still unclear. However, pharmaceutical companies continue to be optimistic enough to invest heavily in their search for oligonucleotide therapies and mAbs that might help the management of difficult-to-treat diseases such as Alzheimer's despite early disappointments. 15 ",

Early success in explaining why Black soldiers were more prone to haemolysis than White soldiers when given the antimalarial pamaquine, and later primaquine, led to increased interest in the genetics of drug response even before the structure of DNA variation had been worked out. 28, 29 Deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) due to genetic variation explained this adverse effect, and soon after, a number of other adverse drug effects were ascribed to this deficiency. 30 This led an enthusiastic editorialist at the British Medical Journal to suggest that 'To prevent attacks persons deficient in G6PD must avoid all potentially harmful drugs and foods. There is a case to be made for the use of routine screening tests, such as the spot-test, on all males of Mediterranean, Asian, or African extraction before treatment with sulphonamides, aspirin, phenacetin, and other drugs 31 '.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug, that is a drug that requires activation by metabolic enzymes including the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C19. In their randomized, but open, trial, they compared CYP2C19 genotype-guided clopidogrel therapy versus standard treatment with ticagrelor or prasugrel, two newer agents known to be effective without genetic guidance. They showed that their genotype-guided therapy was not inferior to the control drugs and resulted in a lower incidence of bleeding. This led Roden, an editorialist, to suggest that one should not wait any further before implementing genotype-guided clopidogrel therapy. 33 Some of the main reasons for lack of enthusiasm for wider implementation of pharmacogenetics in most areas of therapeutics is suggested in Roden's editorial: the variability in frequency of different genetic variants in different populations and recruitment of subjects with primarily European ancestry. In fact, in some populations, different variants of the same gene are often found. Clopidogrel has a complicated metabolic pathway, and although CYP2C19 is important, it is not clear to what extent pathway substitution occurs. 34, 35 Drug metabolism is often as complex as roadways into large cities but biologically more malleable. Block one pathway and another takes over. For conventional drugs, regulators usually require three robust controlled randomized controlled trials to replicate beneficial results and test their generalizability.

In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed seven mAbs for therapeutic use. However, this pathway of drug development is starting to feel like the molecular roulette of the previous therapeutic revolution during which more and more small organic molecules",

However, as the recent failure of an HIV vaccine shows, viruses are elusive, mutating frequently. How quickly a vaccine can be developed is difficult to predict.22 Yet, the approval of the first Ebola vaccine in December 2019 has transformed despair to optimism.23",
