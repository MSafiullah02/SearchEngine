            "text": "The present paradigm is that hantaviruses in the Americas cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), while hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is caused by hantaviruses present in Eurasia [1\u20133]. Hantaviruses associated with HFRS and HPS are primarily transmitted by inhalation of viral particles shed by infected rodents [4, 5]. In both syndromes there is a local immune reaction in the lungs, mainly in terms of a CD8+ T lymphocyte response [2, 6, 7]. Another important feature is endothelial dysfunction and capillary leakage [1\u20133, 8]. After the prodromal phase, including fever, nausea, myalgia and headache, patients with HFRS commonly develop renal failure whereas in HPS the kidneys are often spared and instead the patient frequently presents with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction [1, 3, 9].",

Repeated echocardiogram showed no overt signs of cardiac failure, though several days into her illness the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure increased to >65 mm Hg.

Three days prior to admission he had fallen ill with fever, chills, diarrhoea, dry cough, and dyspnoea. In the emergency room, physical examination was notable for fever, somnolence, tachycardia and hypotension. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air revealed hypoxia and respiratory alkalosis. The patient was taken to the ICU and therapy was started with broad spectrum antibiotics due to suspicion of pneumonia and sepsis. As with the other patients, coagulopathy, increased LDH levels, and renal failure were detected (Table 1).",

Previously, respiratory symptoms were commonly attributed to fluid overload as a result of renal failure. However, increasing evidence show that lung and heart involvement is common during the acute phase of HFRS [10, 11, 22, 23]. Concerning the cases of European hantavirus infection in our present report, there was only mild or no renal impairment at the time of admission, whereas the respiratory involvement was early and severe, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fulfilling criteria of HPS according to CDC case definition [19]. As described in HPS, the three reported patients suffered from cardiovascular dysfunction, requiring treatment with inotropic and vasopressor drugs [9]. Autopsy results support the cause of death to be cardiopulmonary distress due to hantavirus infection. The lungs of both the deceased patients were oedematous and contained mononuclear cell infiltrates with predominantly CD8+ T lymphocytes, as described in HPS patients [2, 7]. Many cells expressed granzyme B and TIA-1, indicating a cytotoxic activity, which could further be supported by high levels of LDH. We chose to demonstrate the immune response in a non-smoker\u2019s lungs (patient 1), but a similar picture was seen in patient 3.",
