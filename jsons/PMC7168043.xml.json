In the past\u2014and still today\u2014polyclonal antibodies were produced as serum in animals like horses 4. A milestone in antibody generation was the development of hybridoma technology that allows the production of monoclonal antibodies 5. But the hybridoma technology has drawbacks like limited number of candidates, possible instability of the aneuploid cell lines 6, inability to provide antibodies against highly conserved antigens and most of all its limited application to generate human antibodies 7. The hybridoma technology essentially gives murine antibodies that can be used for diagnostic or research purposes. However, their therapeutic applications are limited because repeated administration of murine antibodies can cause human anti\u2010mouse antibody reaction, reducing antibody half\u2010life and leading to severe side effects such as anaphylactic shock 8. A strategy to circumvent these problems is antibody humanization or the use of transgenic animals in which the original antibody gene repertoire is replaced with a human gene repertoire 9, 10, 11, 12. Another strategy is the human hybridoma technology resulting in human antibodies 13, 14, although this technology has the same problems of the murine hybridoma technology regarding the limitation of the immune system.",

Two different genetic systems have been developed for the expression of the antibody::pIII (phage protein III) fusion proteins for phage display. First, the antibody genes can be directly inserted into the phage genome fused upstream of the wild\u2010type pIII gene 20. Second, most successful systems, uncouple antibody expression from phage propagation by providing the genes encoding the antibody::pIII fusion proteins on a separate plasmid (called \u201cphagemid\u201d) that contains a phage morphogenetic signal for packaging the vector into the phage particles 18. No matter the used phage display system, antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of M13 phage and the corresponding antibody gene is packaged in the phage particle. Other phage display technologies using phage lambda 21 or T7 22 are less suitable for the display of antibody fragments. In addition, these phages are lytic phage that aggravates the practical work. The most common antibody formats used for antibody phage display are the single chain fragment variable (scFv) 23, 24, 25 or fragment antigen binding (Fabs) 26, 27. Other antibody formats used for phage display are single chain Fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), the variable domains of camel heavy chains (VHHs) and immunoglobulins of sharks (IgNARs) 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. Figure 1 shows an antibody phage and different antibody fragments. For veterinary research, chicken libraries are often used 34, 35. In contrast to what occurs in humans, the diversity of chicken antibody genes is the result of gene conversion, and the N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal parts of chicken's VH and VL are always identical, facilitating antibody gene amplification, and library cloning 36, 37. Also rabbit phage display was used to generate antibodies against pathogens 38.",

An other option is the panning in solution using biotinylated antigens followed by a \u201cpull\u2010down\u201d with streptavidin beads 41. The vast excess of nonbinding antibody phage will be removed by stringent washing. Subsequently, the bound antibody phage will be eluted, e.g. by pH shift or trypsin, and reamplified by infection of E. coli. After infection of the phagemid bearing E. coli with a helperphage, new antibody phage will be produced. The selection cycle will be repeated and the number of antigen\u2010specific antibody phage clones should increase with every panning round. Usually 2\u20133 panning rounds are performed. Finally, monoclonal antibody phage or monoclonal soluble antibodies can be identified by, e.g. ELISA 42, immunoblot 40, or flow cytometry 43. The antibody fragment genes can be subcloned into any other antibody format, e.g. scFv\u2010Fc or IgG 23, 27, 42, 44, 45. A schema of the selection process is given in Fig. 2.",

Currently, two recombinant antibodies are approved for the treatment of pathogens or toxins. Raxibacumab is a human antibody for anthrax treatment derived from a phage display library from Cambridge Antibody Technology (now Medimmune, part of AstraZeneca) in cooperation with Human Genome Science (now GlaxoSmithKline) 64.

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a pathogen with particular cell wall and membrane characteristics that is able to infect and multiply within alveolar macrophages leading to cough, weakness, and fever 92. In 2013, 9 million people were infected and 1.5 million died worldwide 93. In order to improve treatment and control disease spread, TB must be diagnosed as early as possible. One prominent target for this purpose is the bacterial Antigen 85 (Ag85) that is the most abundant protein secreted by Mtb 94. It is a complex of three highly homolog proteins (Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C) with a molecular size of 30\u201332 kDa each 95. In a novel approach by Ferrara et al. 68 monoclonal antibodies were selected against the Ag85 complex by combining phage\u2010 and yeast\u2010display. First, a na\u00efve scFv\u2010library was preselected against Ag85 by phage display, reducing the diversity from \u223c1011 unique scFv clones to \u223c105 colony forming units. Second, the enriched sublibrary was cloned into a yeast\u2010display system. Each clone of the selection output was screened individually for antigen binding by FACS. Those with the highest antigen\u2010binding signals were sorted and further analyzed. In total 192 clones were sequenced revealing 111 genetically unique scFv clones. Further screening assays identified seven antibody pairs, which can detect Ag85 down to a concentration of 6.1 nM in the absence of serum and 22.7 nM in its presence. Interestingly, none of the antibodies were absolutely specific for one of the Ag85 subunits of the complex. All three subunits A, B, and C were bound although not equally. In contrast, Fuchs et al. selected five human antibodies against the recombinant Ag85B protein from the na\u00efve HAL7/8 libraries 81. Three of them bound specifically to the 85B protein in ELISA (LOD: 5 ng/mL). Even sandwich detection of recombinant 85B in ELISA (LOD: 10 ng/mL) and integration into lateral flow immuno assay (LOD: <5 ng/mL) was shown. But antigen detection in Mtb cell extracts or culture filtrates was restricted to direct ELISA and immunoblot assay. The authors of both papers argued that the selected antibodies must be affinity matured in order to reach required detection limits. Successful implementation of this concept was demonstrated by Sixholo et al. 80. Chicken antibodies were selected from the semisynthetic Nkuku library against a 16 kDa recombinant antigen of M. tuberculosis, also known as heat shock protein X (HspX). After four rounds of panning, three scFvs were identified in ELISA. The clone with the lowest ELISA signal was selected for in vitro engineering using two different approaches. First, a mutant library was generated from the parental scFv by error\u2010prone PCR with a diversity of \u223c3 \u00d7 107 unique scFv. This library was selected again on the HspX antigen under more stringent conditions, leading to identification of three mutant scFvs. These contained one or three individual amino acid exchanges, occuring both in CDR and framework regions. All mutants showed increased ELISA\u2010binding signals, reaching a signal \u223c11 times higher when compared to the parental scFv. Furthermore, the mutants showed improved association and dissociation kinetics in ELISA and SPR analysis. In the other approach, the length of the scFv linker was reduced from 15 amino acids to a single glycine residue, forcing tetramerization of antibodies. Due to cooperative binding, the apparent functional affinity was improved. In ELISA, tetrameric scFv generated a \u223c14 times higher ELISA signal, and SPR proved increased association and decreased dissociation rates.",

Skottrup et al. 67 generated a na\u00efve antibody library from camels with a diversity of \u223c5 \u00d7 107 clones. A special feature is that the antibodies consist of a single monomeric VHH domain, also called nanobodies. Advantages of this format are the small size (\u223c15 kDa), the ease production in E. coli, and the convex paratope that is formed which enables the targeting of cryptic epitopes.

The genus Orthopoxvirus includes various species such as monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and especially variola virus that is the causative agent of smallpox in humans. Naturally occurring smallpox has been eradicated in 1977 because of a massive WHO vaccination program that began in 1967. However, no vaccination of the civilian population is conducted nowadays. The potential threat of intentional release has renewed the search for safe and effective smallpox vaccines as case fatality rates of 30% or more among unvaccinated subjects are reported 133. Because orthopoxviruses are highly related, it is assumed, that immunity against one poxvirus goes along with immunity against most members of the entire virus family 132, 134. Using an immune scFv phage display library constructed from vaccinia virus immunized patients, a panel of human vaccinia\u2010specific antibodies was selected. Plaque\u2010reduction neutralization tests revealed that seven of these antibodies neutralized vaccinia as well as cowpox virus in vitro. Five of those antibodies additionally neutralized monkeypox virus 124. Other antibodies were generated from a Fab immune library derived from vaccinia virus immunized chimpanzee. Converted into a chimeric chimpanzee/human IgG format, two antibodies displayed high affinities to vaccinia protein B5 (Kd of 0.2 and 0.7 nM). Antibody 8AH8AL was neutralizing in vitro for vaccinia and smallpox virus and proofed to be protective in mice challenged with vaccinia virus even when administered 2 days after challenge. In this model 8AH8AL proved to provide significantly greater protection than that of the previously isolated rat anti\u2010B5 antibody 19C2 135. Vaccinia had to be used as model, because the final confirmation of protection against smallpox is not possible.",

Because DENV envelope protein is an essential molecule for virion assembly and virus entry, scFvs selected in this study were shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on DENV infection in vitro 102. Dengue nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is essential for viral replication and host immune response modulation, making it an excellent target for dengue\u2010inhibiting antibodies.

Antibodies were generated from an immune library from human donors targeting both VEEV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 146. The isolated Fabs L1A7 and F5 were neutralizing in vitro, with F5 being 300 times more effective than L1A7. Subsequently, F5 was converted into full IgG format and was employed to generate neutralization\u2010escape variants of VEEV for epitope mapping. Within another study, an immune macaque library was used to generate human\u2010like antibodies 119. One of these antibodies, scFv\u2010Fc ToR67\u20103B4, was protective in mice when administered 6 h postviral challenge with VEEV Trinidiad strains, showing 80\u2013100% survival after a challenge with 100\u2010fold LD50. However, scFv\u2010Fc ToR67\u20103B4 was not able to neutralize Trinidad strain in vitro, but other VEEV strains instead, showing that neutralization is not mandatory for an in vivo protective antibody 119.

In this case, specific detection of the VEEV strains TC83, H12/93, and 230 by the selected antibodies was proven. Remarkably, none of the selected scFv phage clones showed cross\u2010reactivity with Alphavirus species of the Eastern equine encephalitis virus and WEEV antigenic complex or with Chikungunya virus, making them ideal tools for the immunological detection and diagnostic of Alphavirus species 105. Two different scFv antibody libraries were constructed from WEEV immunized macaques. Subcloned as scFv\u2010Fc, three antibodies from these libraries specifically bound WEEV in ELISA with little or no cross\u2010reactivity with other alphaviruses and were found to be neutralizing in vitro.

In humans malaria is elicited by at least five different species of Plasmodium, P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi\n175. P. falciparum is responsible for most malaria\u2010related deaths globally, while P. vivax is the most widespread parasite 176. Three different approaches to generate antibodies against P. falciparum using phage display are described. In these studies various structures of different developmental stages of the parasite served as antigens. In a first study Roeffen et al. 160 used two scFv immune libraries, constructed from B\u2010lymphocytes from P. falciparum patients with transmission\u2010blocking immunity, to generate antibodies against Pfs48/45, a surface protein of P. falciparum that is expressed during zygote\u2010 and macrogamete stages. Pfs48/45 is a potential vaccine candidate since it is a target of transmission\u2010blocking antibodies that are taken up by the mosquito together with the blood meal and block within the mosquito's intestinal tract the oocyte development 177, 178, 179. The panning was performed on an extract of gametocytes immobilized in immunotubes and the elution was performed by competition with a mixture of four rat monoclonal mAbs, which recognize distinct epitopes on Pfs48/45 (epitopes I, IIb, III, and V). Interestingly, all selected 14 antibody clones bound to epitope III of Pfs48/45.

Lundquist et al. 161 generated a Fab\u2010immune library from leukocytes of 13 adults with acquired immunity to malaria.

RAM1 and RAM2 also bound to their antigen in fixed and permeabilized cells in flow cytometry. The IgG3 format of RAM1 showed in a functional assay (antibody\u2010dependent cellular inhibition assay, ACDI) an inhibition rate that is comparable to affinity\u2010purified polyclonal anti\u2010MSP\u20103211\u2013237 antibodies derived from immune donors.

An example for a high\u2010risk microorganism that produces the most toxic substances known with the highest risk of potential use as bioweapons is the Gram\u2010positive, anaerobic, spore\u2010forming bacterium Clostridium botulinum, and other Clostridium spp. secreting eight different serotypes (A\u2010H) of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT). Five serotypes (A, B, E, rarely F and only one case of H) are known to cause human botulism, a disease characterized by flaccid muscle paralysis requiring intensive hospital care and passive immunization 198, 199. Especially, serotype A is recognized as the most toxic substance known, showing LD50 of about 1 ng/kg by intravenous route, about 10 ng/kg by the pulmonary route and about 1 \u03bcg/kg for the oral route 200. BoNTs are composed of a disulfide bond\u2010linked 50 kDa light chain and a 100 kDa heavy chain. The heavy chain contains two functional domains (Hc and Hn) that are responsible for toxin uptake into nerve cells by receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis and for the translocation of the light chain across the membrane into the neuronal cytosol. Whereas the catalytic domain of the light chain is responsible for the BoNT toxicity. The current approach for treatment of botulism includes the application of human anti\u2010botulism immunoglobulins, such as BabyBIG, or equine anti\u2010toxin serum. But the human serum stock of BabyBIG is limited and the equine anti\u2010toxin may cause hypersensitivity and serum sickness. In these situations, antibody phage display provides a technology to generate toxin\u2010neutralizing antibodies against each serotype. For instance, a macaque immune library was used to isolate neutralizing scFv with nM affinities against the light chain of BoNT/A 190, 201, 202, but also antibodies against the heavy chain or other relevant serotypes of BoNT are of therapeutic interest. Phage display technology was also used for isolation of single domain antibodies (VHH) after immunization of a llama with a cocktail of 7 BoNT toxoids (A\u2010F) 193. Another approach was the generation of a human antibody gene library after inducing a BoNT/A\u2010specific immune response by in vitro immunization 194. Furthermore, antibody phage display was used to generate antibodies against other clostridial toxins such as those from Clostridium tetani or Clostridium difficile\n188, 203.",

In combination with antibiotics, commercial monoclonal antibodies against PA, such as raxibacumab, are commonly used for treatment 206. In 2012, the FDA approved raxibacumab to treat inhalational anthrax. Due to security issues the use of anti\u2010PA antibodies alone is questionable, since PA could be modified and lose the recognized epitopes while retaining biological activity.

Phage display was used to generate recombinant antibodies from a murine immune library 196 and to identify the epitope of a SEB\u2010specific monoclonal antibody using a peptide phage library 209. Furthermore, a human monoclonal antibody against SEB was isolated from a synthetic human antibody gene library that inhibited SEB binding to MHC\u2010II 195.",

Ricin is a 61\u2010kDa glycoprotein from the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis), which consists of two distinct subunits (RTA and RTB). RTB is a galactose\u2010 and N\u2010acetylgalactosamine\u2010specific lectin that binds to specific sugar residues on the cell surface, allowing internalization of the toxic RTA by endocytosis 210. RTA is an RNA N\u2010glycosidase that irreversibly inactivates eukaryotic ribosomes, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis 211. Human\u2010like antibodies were selected by phage display from a macaque immunized with RTA. One antibody, 43RCA, had a picomolar affinity and neutralized the biological activity of ricin in vitro 191. Furthermore, neutralizing VHH with high affinity was selected from a llama immune library. The best antibody C8 was able to neutralize 100% ricin activity in an in vitro assay using 40 \u03bcg/mL VHH 197.",

Different animals are known to produce high potential toxins containing a complex composition. For example, Tityus serrulatus, known as Brazilian yellow scorpion and the most dangerous scorpion in Brazil, produces a 61\u2010amino acid peptide, called gamma toxin, which is the major toxic component in the venom 212, 213. Regarding this toxin, a neutralizing antibody was isolated from a human library via phage display and was capable of protecting mice 185. The same procedure was used for Bothrops jararacussu, a venomous pit viper species endemic in South America. By using a human antibody gene library, different antibodies were selected to inhibit the phospholipase activity of the venom in vitro and reduce the myotoxicity in vivo 214. Marine organisms can also produce toxins, e.g. the tetrodotoxin (TTX) from pufferfish. Here, scFv were selected from a human na\u00efve antibody gene library neutralizing 99% of TTX activity in vitro 215.",

These antibodies are mainly derived from two types of sources: immune, or na\u00efve libraries. Immune libraries should be preferred when immunized animals or convalescent patients are available, offering the chance to directly isolate affinity matured antibodies. If immunization is not possible or ethically not feasible, na\u00efve antibody gene libraries are an alternative. In such an approach, the antibody generation process is not limited by the immune system. Using antibody phage display a variety of recombinant antibodies was generated for diagnostics and therapy against bacterial, viral pathogens, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins.",
