By March 25, Italy had the second highest number of Covid-19 infections worldwide and the greatest number of deaths.1 Children younger than 18 years of age who had Covid-19 composed only 1% of the total number of patients; 11% of these children were hospitalized, and none died.2 The Coronavirus Infection in Pediatric Emergency Departments (CONFIDENCE) study involved a cohort of 100 Italian children younger than 18 years of age with Covid-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction testing of nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs who were assessed between March 3 and March 27 in 17 pediatric emergency departments. Here, we describe the results of the CONFIDENCE study and compare them with those from three cohorts in previously published analyses.3-5",

A total of 12% of the children appeared ill, and 54% had a temperature of at least 37.6\u00b0C. Common symptoms were cough (in 44% of the patients) and no feeding or difficulty feeding (in 23%); the latter symptom occurred more often in children younger than 21 months of age. Fever, cough, or shortness of breath occurred in 28 of 54 of febrile patients (52%) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). A total of 4% of the children had oxygen saturation values (as measured by pulse oximetry) of less than 95%; all these patients also had imaging evidence of lung involvement. Of the 9 patients who received respiratory support (Table S2), 6 had coexisting conditions. Laboratory and imaging findings are provided in Tables S3 and S4.",

As compared with the other cohorts, fewer patients in our cohort had moderate-to-severe disease, possibly because chest radiography was predominantly used and chest computed tomography was rarely used. Thus, fewer cases of diagnosed (subclinical) pneumonia may have been identified. Bedside lung ultrasonography by experienced sonographers was performed in only 10% of the patients, 90% of whom received a diagnosis of lung interstitial syndrome without further radiographic imaging.",
