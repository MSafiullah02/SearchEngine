In studies based on network pharmacology and molecular docking, researchers found that the core compounds of HXZQ such as quercetin, isorhamnetin, irisolidone, have a stronger binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 3CL (Mpro) than that of remdesivir with COVID-19.

Latest molecular docking results showed that quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, these core compounds in SFJD had high affinity with target proteins.

COVID-19 patients often occur respiratory distress, coagulation disorders and microcirculation disorders, especially in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or/and multiple organ failure, timely use of XBJ can effectively reverse the situation and reduce the fatality. Currently, Chinese researchers are now conducting a prospective analysis of the clinical efficacy of XBJ on COVID-19.

In this study, combining with the latest research, this work highlights the prospect of therapeutic effects and mechanism of 4 TCM in COVID-19 treatment. The therapeutic effects of 4 TCM in COVID-19 potentially focus on: anti-inflammatory, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and cut off cytokine storm, regulating immune response, protecting organ damage. By the continuing expansion of this pandemic, we anticipate more and more good messages about anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of TCM will be discovered to benefit with COVID-19 patients and finally overcome the current epidemic around the corner.",
