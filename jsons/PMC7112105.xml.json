Acidic treatment afforded 10-aminobenzo[b][1,7]phenanthroline 64 in an 18% overall yield starting from proflavine 58 (Scheme 11\n). The second route involves the Skraup cyclization. The monoacylated proflavine 59 was reacted with acrolein diethyl acetal in refluxing acetic acid. The resultant mixture of 62 and 63 was treated with DDQ in acetic acid to afford 63 as the sole product. Deprotection with 4 \nM HCl produced 10-aminobenzo[b][1,7]phenanthroline 64 (Scheme 11).

Although the exact structure of the alkaloid is still unclear, the structural analysis shows that it contains an additional tetrahydropyridine ring (87T4023). The structure of neocalliactine acetate 139, derived from calliactine by heating with water (aromatization) followed by reaction with acetic anhydride, has been established by a total synthesis 92LA1205, 93H943. On the basis of spectral data and the establishment of the neocalliactine acetate 139 structure, structure 32 is the most favorable among the four proposed by Cimino et al. for calliactine (87T4023).\n",

Acronycine (acronine) 208 was the first pyranoacridine alkaloid to be isolated, in 1948 by Hughes and co-workers from the bark of Baurella simplicifolia (Acronychia baueri, an Australian Rutaceae plant) [48NAT(L)223] and in 1949 by Lahey and Thomas from Vepris amphody\n(49MI1). The correct structure was established in 1966 by degradative studies supported by NMR studies 66AJC275, 66T3245 and finally by X-ray crystallographic studies [70AX(B)853]. Acronycine 208 has broad-spectrum antineoplastic activity 85MI1, 89MI1, 92MI1, although its poor solubility in aqueous media is a major hindrance to its development as a clinical agent. Efforts were continued to isolate more alkaloids based on this skeleton, from other plants of Rutaceae family and also through molecular variation, to improve the cytostatic activity of acronycine 208. Other alkaloids based on this system include noracronycine 209\n66T3245, 78MI1, 83JCS(P1)1681, 84JNP285, de-N-methylacronycine 210\n78MI1, 83JCS(P1)1681, de-N-methylnoracronycine 211\n78MI1, 83JCS(P1)1681, citracridone-I 212\n78MI1, 82H273, 83CPB901, 83JCS(P1)1681, 90JCS(P1)1593, citracridone-II 213\n82H273, 83CPB895, 90JCS(P1)1593, citracridone-III 214\n(91H1781), 11-hydroxynoracronycine 215\n82H273, 83CPB895, 83JCS(P1)1681, 90JCS(P1)1593, 11-methoxynoracronycine (baiyamine A) 216\n(86H1595), 11-hydroxy-20-methoxynoracronycine 217\n(84JNP325), acrifoline 218\n(95JNP1629), atalaphyllidine 219\n75E1387, 82IJC16, atalaphyllinine 220\n82IJC16, 82P1771, 83JCS(P1)1681, N-methylatalaphyllinine (11-hydroxy-N-methylseverifoline) 221\n82IJC16, 82P1771, 83JCS(P1)1681, 96P235, severifoline 222\n(82P1771), N-methylseverifoline 223\n82P1771, 83JCS(P1)1681, acronycine epoxide 224\n(88MI3), trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrocitracridone-I 225\n(95H187), (+)-1-hydroxy-1,2-dihydro-de-N-methylacronycine 226\n(87H2057), (\u2212)-cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydro-de-N-methylacronycine 227\n(86JNP1091), 1-oxo-1,2-dihydro-de-N-methylacro-nycine 228\n(87H2057), bicyclo-N-methylatalaphylline 194\n(72JOC3035), acrignine 229\n(93CPB406), neoacrimarines C 230 and D 232\n(93CPB1757), ataline 231\n[73JCS(CC)615], glycobisamines A\u2013C 233, 234a, and 234b\n[93JCS(P1)471], and buntanbismine 235\n(96P221). These alkaloids have been isolated from various species of Citrus, Glycosmis, Severinia, Sarcomelicope, and other plants (all Rutaceae family), and some of them have demonstrated significant biological activity. For example, 11-hydroxynoracronycine 215 showed significant effects on Epstein\u2013Barr virus-EA activation (95MI1), whereas glycobisamine A 233 showed in vitro antimalarial activity comparable to that of chloroquine diphosphate (91AAC377).\n\n\n",

Ring closure with PPA, followed by refluxing with\nmethanolic HCl, afforded methyl 1,3-dimethoxy-9-oxacridin-4-propionate 242. Ether cleavage at C-1, followed by reaction with an excess of MeLi, yielded the tertiary alcohol 243. Fusion with pyridinium chloride at high temperature caused O-demethylation at C-3 with concomitant ring closure. Treatment of the crude product with MeI under basic conditions produced dihydronoracronycine 239. Dehydrogenation with DDQ afforded noracronycine 209, which was converted to acronycine 208 by O-methylation with dimethyl sulfate.",
