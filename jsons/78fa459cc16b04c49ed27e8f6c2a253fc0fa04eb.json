It is again being applied, after earlier failures, because well-trained teams and improved equipment and techniques are available following the success of neonatal ECMO. In addition, in Europe extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCOzR) in adults has been more successful. The use of ECMO for pulmonary failure in children does not have fixed indications and has had considerably less success than neonatal ECMO. Patients who require inspired oxygen fractions of over 0.5 and positive end-expiratory pressures of over 6 cm H 2 0 for more than 12 h after being treated for more than 48 h should be considered candidates, given the high mortality of children with ARDS (70%). Survival averages 50% to 60%. Circuits and patient management techniques are very similar to those for newborn ECMO, but patients usually require longer times on ECMO. There are many more options for cannulation for both venoarterial and venovenous techniques than in neonatal and cardiac ECMO. The improving results indicate that ECMO will play a part in treating children with pulmonary failure. Further studies will be required to determine which patients can benefit from ECMO as well as the exact application in each case.",

A Correspondence to: M. Klein treating patients with lung and heart failure by means of an extracorporeal blood circuit is the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO)I, and many authors feel that the term \"extracorporeal life support\" (ELS) is appropriate, as it embraces support of both lung and heart function. The older term from experience with open-heart surgery is \"cardiopulmonary bypass\", or CPB, which is difficult to pronounce. The recent applications of this technology to adults have emphasized circuit blood flows less than the cardiac output and using the membrane lung mainly to remove carbon dioxide, with the acronym of \"ECCO2R\" for \"extracorporeal CO2 removal.\" Those who wish to unite both oxygenation of the blood and removal of CO2 have suggested \"ECLA\" for \"extracorporeal lung assist.\" I believe that the early term, ECMO, for \"extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\" is the most appropriate, since it was, in fact, the membrane oxygenator that made longterm extracorporeal circulation outside the operating room possible. The early oxygenators utilizing a direct blood-gas interface (bubble, disk, screen) were neither safe nor effective for long-term application.",

The first is: \"Why might ECMO be expected to work?\" Why should we turn our attention to this therapy when so much attention was given to its failure in the 1970s? While neonatal ECMO has been successful, its success is not immediately applicable to pediatric ECMO. ECMO is effective in newborns with diseases characterized by pulmonary artery hypertension as the lung's response to injury, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and occasionally hyaline membrane disease, as well as primary pulmonary artery hypertension or persistent fetal circulation. ECMO supplies the best pulmonary artery vasodilator currently available, namely oxygen, and by the simple application of Boyle's law reduces pulmonary artery pressure by removing blood from the right side of the circulation. Thus, newborns on ECMO are receiving active treatment directed specifically at the underlying problem. While many older children and adults with pulmonary parenchymal disease do have some pulmonary hyperten-284 sion and right-sided heart failure as a component of their illness, it is usually not major. In these cases ECMO is used to support end-organs until the lung can recover and to protect against the oxygen toxicity and barotrauma associated with mechanical ventilation.",

The complicating effects of ventilator barotrauma and oxygen toxicity then make the application of ECMO less likely to be successful. The success of neonatal ECMO, however, has led to the development of trained teams at major medical centers throughout the world who are able to apply the latest technology at an hour or two's notice. The existence of these teams has also generated more interest on the part of industry in developing safe and effective devices.",

[18] in Milan in the treatment of adults with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This work has been reproduced by Knoch et al. [30] in Marburg. Prior to these reports, patients with ARDS responded poorly to all therapies, including ECMO. ARDS is common in children, with perhaps 150,000 cases in the United States each year [10] . The incidence per 1,000 intensive care unit admissions is between 7 and 15, and the mortality averages 70% [6, 13, 25, 27, 33, 34, 39, 43, 46, 52, 54] .

The extracorporeal circuit is then needed only to remove CO2, a process that can be done at flows of only 20% to 30% of the cardiac output as the membrane lung is much more efficient at CO2 removal than at oxygenation, which requires flows of 100% to 150% of the cardiac output. A combination of the use of IRV and ECMO (or ECCO2R as used in this manner) resulted in an overall 79% survival in patients who would have historically had only a 9% chance of survival [18] . Those patients who actually required ECCO2R had a survival of 49%, which compares favorably with the 9.5% survival reported for ECMO in patients with similar entrance criteria in 1979. At the University of Michigan, ECMO has been applied to adults with similar success using more traditional extracorporeal support of both oxygenation and CO2 removal [2] .",

The patients were much more ill than anyone had suspected. Those designing the entry criteria had felt that they had chosen criteria predicting 50% mortality and found that 285 they predicted 90% mortality. Also, time on a ventilator prior to ECMO had not been used in the criteria, thus allowing patients with an advanced stage of pulmonary fibrosis to be included in the study. Most current experience in the United States demonstrates that adult patients with ARDS who have been ventilated for longer than 5 days and children with ARDS who have been ventilated for longer than 7 days are unlikely to survive. In addition, the time on ECMO in the 1979 study was limited to 5 days, while most centers doing ECMO for pulmonary support now find that patients frequently require ECMO not just for days, but for weeks and often as long as 1 month.",

The venous drainage cannula is passed to the level of the right atrium via the right internal jugular vein (IJV) by an open cutdown technique ( Fig. 1 ). Venous drainage of the right heart in this fashion relieves the element of right heart failure that often accompanies lung disease and lowers pulmonary artery pressure by decreasing the volume on the right side of the circulation. Some authors have feared that this could lead to pulmonary infarction or ischemia by decreasing lung Dual-lumen cannula passed to right atrium from right internal jugular vein that is used for single-catheter VV ECMO in newborns ( Fig. 3) . Cannulas for this purpose are generally available for the more widespread practice of supported angioplasty in adults [22, 56] , a technique in which cardiac output is supported by an ECMO circuit while coronary arteries are occluded by the angioplasty balloon. It has also been used to support adults in cardiac arrest until a diagnosis can be made and the underlying cardiac lesion corrected [45] . These drainage cannulas can reach as high as the right atrium and are quite effective. The arterial perfusion cannula is most often passed via the fight common carotid artery to the level of the aortic arch (Fig. 4) . This provides excellent end-organ support. Animal studies have raised some concern that the blood returned via this cannula is jetted distally and does not supply the coronary and cerebral circulations well [38, 48] , but in humans it may provide just the turbulent flow necessary to perfuse these organs. Much concern has been raised about permanent ligation of the carotid artery. To date there is little experimental or clinical evidence that this has any deleterious effects, but some centers repair the carotid artery at decannulation [1] . Our concern has been that if ligation of the carotid artery does cause ischemia, the worst time to revascularize it would be after 5 to 7 days when a reperfusion injury or hemorrhage might be expected. If, on the other hand, no damage has been done, why risk the The arterial perfusion cannula can also be placed from the groin, as it is in the supported angioplasty systems. This is usually a short end-hole cannula that reaches the internal iliac artery at the farthest (Fig. 4) . While effective in perfusing end-organs in patients with little or no cardiac output, the aortic arch is not perfused well in patients with an effective left ventricular output [36, 58] , so it is of no value in pediatric pulmonary patients in whom one can expect excellent perfusion to the lower body and continuing de-saturation in the upper body. To employ groin VA ECMO, it is necessary to perfuse the aortic arch via a long arterial cannula that is not easily available (Fig. 4) .",

This can be done by open cutdown using the saphenous vein at the saphenofemoral junction so that at decannulation the We believe there are many advantages to percutaneous cannulation. It seems to us that much larger cannulas can be placed percutaneously, perhaps because the vessel is well supported by its surrounding tissues and perhaps by avoiding vessel spasm, which occurs to some extent whenever the vessel is exposed, no matter how gently it is handled. For decannulation, these cannulas can be withdrawn and hemostasis achieved by applying pressure at the site, making operative repair or ligation unnecessary. The perfusion cannulas available are relatively short and provide for the type of VV ECMO originally done in the newborn with return of oxygenated blood to the iliac vein. This is frequently successful (Fig. 6 ), but in order to diminish recirculation most physicians doing adult ECMO have used the cannula arrangement of Gattinoni (Fig. 7) . The venous drainage cannula in this technique is placed at about the level of the renal veins, and the longer perfusion cannula is specially designed with an end-hole placed at the junction of the IVC and the right atrium. The blood returning to the patient is thus more likely to be directed to the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery and less likely to be drained back to the circuit from which it came. It is unlikely that this would be applicable in a patient whose primary problem is poor oxygenation, since little or none of the SVC venous blood is captured by the circuit and therefore blood flows approaching the cardiac output cannot be achieved. Many patients beyound the neonatal age, however, primarily need CO2 removal and will achieve satisfactory oxygenation with this circuit.",

The rate of flow is most dependent on the amount of venous return available to the pump, as in the human heart. It is the surgeon's responsibility to place the largest possible cannula and, if necessary, to place additional venous cannulas from other veins to augment venous return. Table 1 reviews the pump flows that can be expected with some of the usual venous drainage cannulas for the pediatric age group. A smaller diameter is acceptable for the perfusion cannula for two reasons: there is no tendency for the wall of the vessel to occlude the cannula holes, and there is less hemolysis for a given pressure gradient when blood is passing from the lower to the higher pressure environment than when it is going from the higher to the lower pressure system.",

This type of pump, however, has many more disadvantages. Its use requires a functioning flowmeter. Care must be exercised in blood sampling as there is no low-pressure portion of the system, only high pressure after the pump and negative pressure with its threat of air embolus before the pump. The major problem, however, is the generation, of heat and thrombus formation in the pump head, which can lead to significant hemolysis.",

Since the Kolobow lung does not take up very much room, it is difficult to see how this is much of a disadvantage. The silicone rubber lung also has a relatively high priming volume and resistance. The resistance can be overcome by mounting two of these lungs in parallel in the circuit. The hollow-fiber lungs are microporous and allow leakage of plasma and foaming, which has limited their use. One design is currently marketed with a heparin coating, but has not yet overcome the problem of requiring frequent oxygenator changes during a long run due to plasma leakage and failure of gas exchange.",

The PaO2 can be regulated by pump blood flow and the PaCO2 can be regulated by the gas flow ventilating the membrane lung. The important unsettled issues involve how to manage the native lung and how to control Needing. Opinions as to how the patient's lung should be managed while on ECMO can be divided into two opposing camps. One advocates high PEEP and high mean airway pressure (MAP) while trying to limit PIP. This, they believe, prevents atelectasis and recruits collapsed or fluid-filled alveoli. The other group stresses lung rest to avoid the barotrauma and oxygen toxicity that appear to make ARDS irreversible by creating pulmonary fibrosis. Most ECMO centers agree that pediatric patients with pulmonary disease require longer courses of ECMO than newborns and that bleeding will become a problem. Many options are available. We find that bleeding becomes troublesome on about the 3rd day of ECMO. It usually arises from a previously placed chest tube or operative site, although it can be from the lung, bladder, or gastrointestinal tract. We try not to operate, as our experience has been that this only creates more bleeding. We use as many nonoperative means as possible such as vasoconstrictive agents (epinephrine and phenylephrine), hemostatic agents (topical thrombin and fibrin glue), and direct pressure. We also correct, as much as possible, the coagulopathy induced by both heparin and the circuit by giving platelet transfusions to keep the platelet count over 100,000, FFP 10 ml/kg every 6 h, and vitamin K. Other components of the coagulation cascade are administered if their deficit is measureable and they are available. When bleeding persists we operate with the patient on ECMO. If bleeding persists at >10 ml/kg per hour despite all efforts, we try to take the patient off ECMO. If we feel this cannot be tolerated, we try to eliminate heparin while keeping the pump blood flow high to avoid circuit clotting [57] . It is helpful to have a second circuit primed at the bedside should clotting in the original circuit occur. Often bleeding will stop after 6 to 12 h without heparin, which may then be resumed slowly.",

Also, ECMO patients frequently have renal failure in addition to pulmonary failure, which may require connecting the dialysis machine to the ECMO circuit. We have found, however, that with large-volume ultrafiltration (100 to 200 rnl removed each hour) accompanied by replacement with an appropriate fluid (usually D5/0.45 normal saline) the potassium, urea nitrogen, creatinine, ammonia, and fluid balance can be controlled.",

We would strongly argue against this practice. No pathologist has been able to make a specific and accurate diagnosis from a lung biopsy that could help determine whether or not the patient should go on ECMO. Even diagnoses such as \"diffuse fibrosis\" are not incompatible with recovery 291 and, in any event, they only report on a small part of a very large organ that is remarkable for the lack of uniformity of any process within it. Right middle lobe \"hepatization\" does not mean the left lower lobe is not well ventilated with \"minimal thickening of alveolar septae.\" We find that lung biopsies only increase bleeding problems and do not really aid in decision-making. This is not to say that lung biopsy should be avoided in all patients who might become ECMO candidates: it is frequently helpful in establishing etiology and directing therapy in patients with respiratory failure, but lung biopsy has not been helpful for patients who are about to go on or are already on ECMO.",

The development of techniques for limiting the amount of anticoagulation required, whether platelet-active agents, heparincoated circuits, or regional anticoagulation of the device, should decrease the amount of bleeding and the deleterious pulmonary effects of the attendant massive transfusion. More sophisticated ECMO devices should allow some decrease in the number of personnel required to treat an ECMO patient. Given the current increase in laboratory research and clinical experience along with the growing success, it seems appropriate to predict that ECMO will become a part of the critical care of children with pulmonary parenchymal disease.",

Venous c~nula positions showing long venous ~ainage c~ula placed from co--on femoral vein to right atrium blood flow, but most of the lung's nutrient supply of blood comes from the bronchial arteries. The IJV also allows placement of the largest possible cannula to provide adequate venous return for blood flows equal to or greater than the cardiac output.There have been theoretical concerns that ligation of the IJV can increase intracranial pressure and lead to intracranial hemorrhage. This has led some authors to spearately drain the distal IJV and \"Y\" the two drainage lines together to the pump. We have found that as much as 20% of the venous return can be obtained by using this distal drainage, making it much easier to increase pump Arterial perfusion cannula positions showing standard cannula passed to level of aortic arch from right common carotid artery as well as short femoral arterial cannula that can be used when left ventricular output is poor, longer femoral artery cannula reaching to aortic arch, which is necessary when left ventricular output is effective, and axillary artery cannulation flows, and have continued to use it in older children in whom venous return from the atrium can be inadequate to provide normal blood gases no matter how large the venous cannula(Fig. 2). We also attempt to repair the vein when it has been drained distally at the time of decannulation, since there would appear to be few if any complications associated with this procedure.The venous drainage cannula can also be placed from the groin, either by open cutdown or percutaneously Subcl avi an .,o0,o ..... ..... .,,.o l~ig. 5.",
