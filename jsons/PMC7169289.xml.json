Fungicidal concentrations can be detected in feline hair after 9 days treatment and detectable levels persist for at least 8 weeks following 14 days oral therapy (30\u201340 mg kg\u22121) every 24 h.\n9\n, \n10\n Terbinafine has a limited impact on mammalian cytochromes and there are few reported adverse effects or drug interactions.\n9\n, \n10\n The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against most dermatophytes, including M. canis, M. gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes is low (MIC90 = 0.03 \u00b5g mL\u22121).\n11\n, \n12\n Several studies have reported efficacy in feline dermatophytosis at doses of 8.25\u201340 mg kg\u22121 for 14\u2013120 days in naturally and experimentally affected cats,\n10\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n although terbinafine is not licensed for animals.

El tratamiento con itraconazol fue interrumpido debido a la falta de eficacia en un gato (un Persa) y efectos adversos inaceptables en el otro (un gato Maine Coon). Ambos gatos obtuvieron cura cl\u00ednica y micol\u00f3gica tras 12\u201314 semanas de tratamiento con 26\u201331 mg/kg de terbinafina q24 por via oral (PO). Los signos cl\u00ednicos en el gato Maine Coon resolvieron por completo tras siete semanas de tratamiento. Cuatro semanas de tratamiento adicional con lavados semanales con un champ\u00fa con 2% de clorhexidina/2% miconazol tras rasurado produjo una reducci\u00f3n de un 98% en el micetoma del gato Persa que despu\u00e9s se extirp\u00f3 quirurgicamente. Dermatofitosis generalizada recurrente en el gato Persa habia sido controlada con terapia en pulso con 26 mg/kg de terbinafina q24 PO durante una semana de cada mes. No se descubrieron otras condiciones que pudieran haber predispuesto a la dermatofitosis en ninguno de los gatos. La administraci\u00f3n de terbinafina se asoci\u00f3 con letargia leve a moderada en el gato Persa, pero no se observaron otros efectos adversos o cambios en los par\u00e1metros sanguineos.

Die Therapie mit Itraconazol wurde bei einer Katze (einer Perserkatze) abgesetzt, da sie unwirksam war und bei der anderen Katze (einer Maine Coon Katze) wegen inakzeptablen Nebenwirkungen. Bei beiden Katzen wurde nach 12\u201314 Wochen der Behandlung mit 26\u201331 mg/kg Terbinafin alle 24 Stunden per os (PO) eine klinische und mykologische Heilung erzielt. Die klinischen Symptome bei der Main Coon verschwanden nach einer Behandlungsdauer von sieben Wochen zur G\u00e4nze. Eine vier Wochen lange Therapie mit zus\u00e4tzlichen w\u00f6chentlichen B\u00e4dern mit einem 2% Chlorhexidin/2% Mikonazol Shampoo nach der Schur bewirkte eine 98% ige Reduktion der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Mycetoms bei der Perserkatze, welches danach chirurgisch entfernt wurde. Die wiederkehrende generalisierte Dermatophytose der Perserkatze wurde mittels Pulstherapie mit 26 mg/kg Terbinafin alle 24 Stunden PO f\u00fcr eine Woche eines jeden Monats kontrolliert. Es wurden trotz intensiver Untersuchungen bei keiner der Katzen zugrunde liegende Ursachen gefunden, die f\u00fcr eine Dermatophytose pr\u00e4disponiert h\u00e4tten. Die Verabreichung von Terbinfin bewirkte bei der Perserkatze eine leichte bis moderate Lethargie, aber es wurden keine weiteren Nebenwirkungen oder Ver\u00e4nderungen bei den Blutparametern gesehen. Nach bestem Wissen des Autors handelt es sich hierbei um den ersten Bericht eines Dermatophyten Mycetoms bei einer Maine Coon Katze sowie die erfolgreiche Behandlung dieses Zustandes bei Katzen mit Terbinafin Therapie.",
