There are five distinct physiographic areas on the slope, each separated by sharp boundaries which mostly correspond to boundaries between features on the cliffs above. The physiography is a consequence of a seriesof landslides of different, but unknown, ages. A model of the physiographic history is presented. Each physiographic area supports a different vegetation community, also separated by sharp boundaries. The present structure of two communities, Melaleuca howeana scrub and Howea forsterana forest, is a consequence of damage by feral animals. Melaleuca scrub has replaced Cyperus lucidus sedgeland destroyed by goats (Capra hircus) browsing from 1914 until their extermination in 1955. Hov/ea forest has a markedly unimodal age distribution with very few small individuals ofthe dominant palms. This is a result of the combined effects of browsing by goats on small palms, and seed predation by black rats (Rattus rattus)/rom the 1920s, preventing regeneration.",

The evidence of a certain stage may have been destroyed by subsequent events. This is particularly true of slow changes induced, for example, by climatic changes.

Landslides and rockfalls rarely cover more than a few tens of hectares but wreak catastrophic changes to vegetation in their paths. A notable example occurred in Chile in 1960 when mass movement caused by an earthquake swarm affected over 25 000 ha (Veblen & Ashton 1978) .",

The outer face of the rampart is vertically below the lip of the top, or outer limit, of the overhang. Thus the rampart is protected from erosion from water cascading down the cliffs during storms. The northern and southern ends of the rampart coincide with permanent water drips from the cliffs. Behind the rampart the ground drops c. 5 m to the sandy floor of the cave. (c) Palm forest. Directly below the southern end of the large overhang in the cliffs above ( Fig. 2 ) the northern boulder slope ends abruptly. The slope increases, boulders at the surface are generally considerably larger, and the slope is clad with palm forest. The area commences immediately above the steep cliff c. 25 m high of poorly sorted rubble behind the beach. The slopes here are not as simple as in the first area; scree, rock slab outcrops, avalanche debris and swampy creeks all occur, but the boulders dominate the slope. Some soil is present, filling spaces between the boulders. Slabs of basalt outcrop in shallow creek gullies and become more numerous towards the top of the slope until they merge into the base of the cliffs.",

A general age sequence would be: Mixed fems and herbs -* Cassinia-Melaleuca -^ Melaleuca -^ Howea. This is not a Clementsian succession, where Howea will inevitably replace Melaleuca. Indeed, there is no evidence anywhere on the island for such a succession. It is merely an indication of what appears to be relative length of time necessary for each community to develop. As both the dry rampart and Potato Hills support similar vegetation (sparse herbs and some Cassinia-Melaleuca) physiography (here at least) dominates other factors.

Pigs {Sus Scrofa L.) were released on Little Slope several decades ago but were exterminated a few years later so they are unlikely to have exerted a lasting effect.

Hough, who subsequently published it in the Evening News, 25 July 1922): 'Last year the islanders gathered 342 bushels (12.43 m'') of seed (from Little Slope) but this year the yield was eight bushels (0.29 m^). The next crop which should be in the green is not in sight. Everywhere there is evidence of the depredation ofthe rats.' During the present study virtually no ripe palm seeds were seen on Little Slope as is shown by seed production data from the 50 sampled trees (Table 2 ). In 1977 two island assistants and I saw partially eaten, unripe seeds of the 1978 crop marked with rats' incisor teeth. These two observations, separated by 50 years, imply that rats consume virtually all seeds. It is possible that the decline in seed yield in 1922 was partially caused by droughts which occurred in 1917, 1918 and 1921 . As Howea takes four years from bud initiation to seed ripening, a drought at a critical physiological phase in any one of these years could reduce the seed yield. However, even in drought years, trees protected from rats have higher yields than unprotected trees (B. Thompson pers. comm.) and it is highly unlikely that the virtual lack of regeneration for 22 years can be attributed solely to droughts. Seed predation by rats is a more likely cause. This is supported by more recent (1980, 1981) good harvests of palm seed from Little Slope following an intensive poisoning program.",

After the extermination of goats in 1955 rats continued to eat all seeds except those few which escaped their attention.

Young seedlings would have matured but no seeds would have been available for germination. FIG. 9.

All are examples of predation and, taken together, strongly affect forest composition. This predation is modem and considerably younger than the palm stands, which developed free from this predation. Unless seed predation is periodically reduced to allow sufficient seedlings to germinate and establish in the next decade, the palm forest on Little Slope may not survive beyond the life of the present trees.",
