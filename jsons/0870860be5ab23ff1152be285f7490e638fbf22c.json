In Wuhan, China, then the epicentre of the pandemic, Cao et al. under heroic circumstances, conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection including as an entry criteria oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94% or less on air (ChiCTR2000029308). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice daily for 14 days, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. 6 Even though their study showed no benefits with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care, this is exactly the sort of study that best informs our treatment options.",

The FDA has approved it, although at the time of writing they haven't explained the rationale behind the approval, and as a consequence patients, institutions and the worried public have demanded immediate chloroquine for all. The resulting rush on chloroquine has led to severe shortages of the drug, and patients taking regular chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for lupus or other systemic diseases had to stop their treatment due to a lack of supply. This drug has well known often serious toxicities; 10 we note one small study was stopped due to potential cardiac complications (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/health/chloroquine-coronavirus-trump.html) and we suggest it should only be taken in the context of a randomised or other clinical study. This is not to suggest single arm studies are not helpful: they inform subsequent trials including dosage, duration and appropriate endpoints. For example, we have observed 11 that use of baricitinib for 10 days is associated with viral rebound in nasopharyngeal swabs in rapidly recovered and discharged patients, and thus have recommended longer use in the large randomised studies in which it is included, and we suggest again that comparisons between different therapies or placebo are likely to yield more informative results than randomised studies comparing 10 days of intravenous remdesevir with 5 days (https://benevolent.ai/news/potential-treatment-for-covid-19-identified-by-benevolentai-usingartificial-intelligence-enters-clinical-testing And https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-begins-clinical-testingtherapies-covid-19).",

Because they included only mild-to-moderate patients, the pre-defined primary endpoint was the conversion at day 21 of positive-to-negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. The real time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) method used was indeed appropriate as it was performed simultaneously on two target genes, ORF1ab and N genes, and positive and negative controls were used at each batch. Negative conversion required 2 separate real time RT-PCR tests separated by 24 hours, and the entry criteria for the definition of mild-to-moderate including the absence of pneumonia are entirely appropriate. Baseline criteria between the 3 groups were well-matched (a criticism of one of the hydroxychloroquine randomised studies is this was not the case 13 ) and follow up was appropriate. Their data helpfully shows there was no difference between any of the groups in the primary endpoint.",

Although many drugs have predicted in vitro activity against the virus, the proposal that such drugs might provide more benefit than harm is not appropriate with no evidence base supporting efficacy in any patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. A preprint reporting results from a randomised trial of the anti-viral favipravir versus arbidol in 240 adults has shown no difference in clinical recovery at 7 days, but cough and pyrexia were improved on favipravir. 14 These authors and Li et al. should be applauded for their efforts to add a useful randomised trial to the literature, albeit one that is negative. It is critical to publish such studies. International multicentre trials, such as Discovery (NCT04315948) and Solidarity (EudraCT Number 2020-000982-18), will randomise patients with COVID-19 to receive different drugs in adaptive study designs. Such initiatives will provide the best and most relevant data to guide management of patients with COVID-19.",

When patients take these off-label and recover it is not known whether the drug was helpful in the disease course without randomisation. Similarly, when patients deteriorate, we do not know if they should be continued or considered clinically ineffective and stopped. Assessing viral loads by PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs as performed in the trial here, will help clarify the roles of these medicines going forwards.",
