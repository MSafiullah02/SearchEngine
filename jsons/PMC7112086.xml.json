            "text": "Ten years after the SARS-CoV pandemic, the emergence of the MERS-CoV reminded us that unknown coronaviruses still pose a potential threat to human health (Drosten et al., 2003, Bermingham et al., 2012). Those two emblematic coronaviruses likely emerged from interspecies transmission in the vicinity of humans, such as suspected for a growing number of other coronaviruses (e.g. BCoV/OC43, PRCV, 229E, NL63). This interspecies-jump capacity makes coronaviruses of particular concern to animal and public health and advocates for stronger surveillance of their circulation in wildlife. Coronaviruses are extremely diverse and circulate in many wildlife species however, diversity is most notable in bats (Tang et al., 2006, Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015). Phylogenetic relationships between coronaviruses infecting humans and those infecting bats have been extensively discussed though no direct transmission has ever been documented (Huynh et al., 2012, Ge et al., 2013, Yang et al., 2014). The ecological richness and phylogenetic diversity of bat species are fundamental drivers of coronavirus diversity and evolution in bats (Tang et al., 2006, Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015, Woo et al., 2006, Cui et al., 2007, Lau et al., 2007, Gouilh et al., 2011, Balboni et al., 2012, Drexler et al., 2014). Rhinolophids (Rhinolophidae) and their sister group the hipposiderids (Hipposideridae) have been previously shown to harbour SARS-CoV like viruses in Asia, eastern-Europe and Africa (Gouilh et al., 2011, Li et al., 2005, Li et al., 2006, Tong et al., 2009, Lau et al., 2010, Quan et al., 2010, Drexler et al., 2010, Rihtari\u010d et al., 2010, Lelli et al., 2013). The Rhinolophidae family geographic range extends from Asia to southern Europe and Africa. Consequently, rhinolophids in the western Europe could harbour betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV like viruses. Therefore, SARS-CoV phylogroup may circulate up to the western limit of the region.",

The aims of the present study were (i) to get a wider picture of coronaviruses genetic diversity circulating in representative bats species living in the western Palearctic and (ii) to explore the presence of SARS-CoV related viruses in the region. As bat coronaviruses are shed in faeces, sampling consisted mainly of guano collection. This sampling strategy allowed us to, minimize the impact of sampling on bat populations under study (i.e. In accordance with wildlife conservation principles and in order to minimize biases), and to focus surveillance at key transmission points and ecological interfaces.",

From 2008\u20132016, more than 1500 faecal samples were collected from 26 Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, Miniopteridae and Molossidae bat species. Regions with a great diversity of bat species (central and southern France, northern and north-eastern Spain and Balearic Islands) including swarming sites an maternity colonies, were particularly targeted as they were more likely to harbour a greater viral diversity. The western limit of the study area (western Brittany) and sites harbouring species that had not yet been extensively studied, were also targeted. While most of the study sites were located in France and Spain, a few samples were also opportunistically collected from other countries in the region such as Tunisia and Morocco. These sampling sites fall within three major climatic zones representative of the western Palearctic: the temperate oceanic (Atlantic coast, Brittany and north Spain), the Mediterranean (north-east Spain, Balearic islands) and the humid continental (central-southern France and north-east Spain). Bat species were identified using both morphological characters and acoustic data and confirmed by cytochrome b (Cyt-b) sequencing (Puechmaille et al., 2007). Most faecal samples were collected under roosting bats (n=1186, 76% - Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in LF6, LF9, LS7; Myotis emarginatus in LF6; Myotis myotis in LS11 and ambiguous specimen,\nTable 1) while others were obtained directly from captured individuals. During captures, all manipulations were conducted in accordance with Eurobats (www.eurobats.org) guidelines. Trapping sessions were conducted using harp-trap, flip-net or hand-net, and fresh faeces were collected from clean cotton bags in which bats were temporarily isolated. Sampling under roosting bats was carried out after bats had left for foraging at dusk; clean sheets of paper were deposited on the floor under the colony's roost and fresh faeces were collected within 2\u201310 h. All samples were preserved in cold, antibiotic supplemented, universal transport medium for virus preservation or RNA later (Ambion) for RNA preservation.",

Nucleic acids were eluted in 60 \u00b5l RNAse-free saline buffer, 7 \u00b5l were immediately used for reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction using ssIII-RT (Life tech) and hexamers. Five \u00b5l of RT product were then used as template in a 25 \u00b5l semi-nested PCR reaction resulting in the amplification of a 440 / 220 (first PCR / nested PCR) nucleotide fragment of the RNA-dependent-RNA-Polymerase (RdRp, nsp12) coding region. The homemade semi-nested PCR protocols and primers designed to detect a broad range of coronaviruses were described previously (Gouilh et al., 2011) and allow to obtain fragments of the polymerase (nsp12) ranging from 121 to 393 nucleotides after primer and quality trimming. Briefly, the first PCR (PCR 1) used BatCoV pol 15197 (forward: 5\u2032-GGTTGGGAYTAYCCWAARTGTGA-3\u2032) and Bat-CoV pol 15635 (reverse: 5\u2032-CCATCRTCMGAHARAATCATCATA-3\u2032) primers; the second semi-nested PCR (PCR 2) used BatCoV pol nested 15419 (forward nested primer: 5\u2032-GCNAATWSTGTNTTTAACAT-3\u2032) and the PCR 1 reverse primer. For both PCRs (PCR 1 and the semi-nested PCR 2) the pcr programs were composed of 3 min of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles including 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 30 s at 50 \u00b0C (with a touch-down of 0.7 \u00b0C per cycle during the first 10 cycles) and 30 s at 72 \u00b0C. The final extension was performed at 72 \u00b0C for 8 min. Bat Cyt-b sequences were amplified by PCR (Puechmaille et al., 2007) for all coronavirus-positive samples in order to confirm the host species and for a representative number of coronavirus-negative samples, to evaluate co-roosting. The PCR products were revealed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and were sequenced using Big-Dye v1.1 chemistry on an ABI-3730XL sequencer. Resulting chromatograms were trimmed, analysed and assembled using the CLC Main Workbench software v7 (Qiagen) and cleaned sequences were submitted to a BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) in GenBank.",

The main phylogenetic analyses were performed under a Bayesian statistical framework implemented in BEAST (version 1.8.3) (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007), using the model that fits best the data according to the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) obtained in Jmodeltest2 (Darriba et al., 2012). The general time reversible model of substitution was used, with a gamma distribution and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR+I+G). The coalescent (constant size) model was specified as tree prior and a relaxed molecular clock with an uncorrelated lognormal distribution was used (Drummond et al., 2006, Kingman, 1982).

New coronaviruses were detected in France, Spain, Tunisia and Morocco (\nFig. 2). Among the 1551 samples tested, 212 (13.6%) were found positive for coronavirus, representing 10/26 (42%) species of bats and 20/39 (51%) of localities (Table 1). When considering species sampled at a given site with significant sampling size (n > 30), the prevalence ranged from 8.8% (i.e. Alphacoronavirus EPI4 in Myotis nattereri in LF5, Pont-ch\u00e2teau, Loire Atlantique, France) to 37.9% (i.e. Betacoronavirus EPI1 in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in LF6, Cantoin, Aveyron, France). Identity to known coronaviruses ranged from 85% to 99% according to 393 nucleotides of the conserved nsp12 gene (Fig. 2B). Six alphacoronaviruses were found to have their closest described relative in Europe (in Bulgaria, Spain or Germany) whereas five were more closely related to Asian coronaviruses previously reported from China and Hong Kong S.A.R. (Fig. 2 A/B) (Woo et al., 2006, Drexler et al., 2010, Falc\u00f3n et al., 2011, Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008). Alphacoronaviruses were predominantly detected in Myotis species (Vespertillionidae) while betacoronaviruses were associated with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum only (Rhinolophidae) (Table 1, Fig. 2). Phylogenetic analyses show no major contradiction between virus-host association found here and in literature (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015, Woo et al., 2006, Drexler et al., 2010). The 121 partial nsp12 sequences analysed represent at least nine Alphacoronavirus species (44% pairwise nucleotide identity or less) and one putative new species of Betacoronavirus (Betacoronavirus EPI1 - \u201cEPI\u201d stands for EPICOREM, the acronym of the name of the project in which this study was hosted). This putative new species of Betacoronavirus has less than 83% pairwise nucleotidic identity to the closest reference and exhibits an intraspecific genetic diversity (i.e. Strains \u2013 Fig. S2). Notably, this Betacoronavirus EPI1 grouped with the SARS-CoV sister-clade and was detected in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum only, but repeatedly in different colonies from western Brittany to north-eastern Spain (i.e. LF6, LF9, LS7, LS11; Fig. 2, Table 1). Notably, no MERS-CoV-like virus was detected in this study. Among nine alphacoronaviruses reported here, mainly in Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae bats, two species, tentatively named Alphacoronavirus EPI4 and Alphacoronavirus EPI7 were also detected in multiple species, including in Rhinolophidae (Fig. 2, Table 1). Interestingly, Alphacoronavirus EPI6 was detected in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum only and clustered with alphacoronaviruses previously detected in Eastern Europe by Drexler et. al. in a clade rooted by Alphacoronavirus Hiparm Ratcha detected in Hipposideros armiger (Hipposideridae, sister family to Rhinolophidae) in Tha\u00efland in 2007 (Gouilh et al., 2011, Drexler et al., 2010).",

According to nucleotide identity on the very conserved nsp12, half of the Coronavirinae species detected here (Alphacov. EPI2, EPI5, EPI7, EPI9 and EPI10) are closer to strains reported from Asia and are new for the region. Therefore, the diversity of coronaviruses in western Europe is much higher than previously described (Fig. 1, Fig. 2 (Drexler et al., 2010; Rihtari\u010d et al., 2010; Lelli et al., 2013; CBEM et al., 2010; Falc\u00f3n et al., 2011; Kohl and Kurth, 2014; Goffard et al., 2015; Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008)). Globally, coronavirus species were mostly associated with one bat genus (or even species) and phylogenetically related to those that circulate in their host's sister species in Asia (Fig. 2). This highlights the fundamental effect of the hosts diversity, phylogeny and evolution on the contemporaneous genetic diversity of coronaviruses found in bats (Gouilh et al., 2011, Foley et al., 2015).",

This, in combination with genetic drift, may promote the variability of strains leading to a fast evolution of coronaviruses. Moreover, the seasonal movements of bats, the heterogeneous distribution of individuals within the species range, the sexual and the gregarious behaviours of certain species, may reinforce and even trigger the prevalence variations and their effects on the genetic evolution of coronaviruses.",

The colony of Myotis myotis sampled in that location exhibited the highest prevalence (13.5%) of alphacoronaviruses EPI5 and EPI7 detected among locations with representative sampling size (Table 1). ii) The maternity colonies of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum harboured the Betacoronavirus EPI 1 at a high prevalence both in LF6, Bretagne and LF9, Aveyron, France (Fig. 2, Table 1). These high prevalences illustrated the intense circulation of coronaviruses associated with these specific ecological contexts. Both mixed-species roosts and maternity colonies boost the viral prevalence of a given colony. When occurring concomitantly at several sites across the wide geographical range of bat species, these local boosts of prevalence may promote local-specific and fast seasonal genetic drift of coronaviruses, possibly giving rise to new viral lineages. This diversification process is illustrated here by the genetic variability of the RdRp (i.e. that exhibits Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) found within several phylogroups and within putative coronavirus species (e.g. Betacoronavirus EPI1 and Alphacoronavirus EPI4 - Fig. S2).",

Several Alphacoronavirus species, were identified in different species of bats (e.g. a given Alphacoronavirus species infecting several species of bats). This attests that inter-species jump may (although rarely) occur in a favourable ecological context such as when different species of bats share the same roost, a behaviour called co-roosting. This in turn may promote the spread of a coronavirus across the distribution area of the new host. This hypothetical mechanism may explain the detection of Alphacoronavirus EPI4 in Myotis nattereri, Myotis daubentonii and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in three locations and the presence of Alphacoronavirus EPI5 in both Myotis myotis and Myotis capaccinii (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Furthermore, co-roosting behaviour of Myotis myotis, Miniopterus schreibersii and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum may also explain the detection of Alphacoronavirus EPI7 in these taxa that belong to different species and genera. The apparent zoonotic behaviour of these alphacoronaviruses described here contrasts with conclusions of other studies (Fischer et al., 2016) but correlates with the social behaviour of species in the genus Myotis that often share their roost with multiple species, and sometimes even with other genera (e.g. Miniopterus or Rhinolophus) (Barataud and Aulagnier, 2012; Crucitti, 1993). This co-roosting behaviour of Myotis spp. was specifically observed during the fieldwork of our study. Several Myotis sp. individuals were observed in close contact with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, in several colonies. This frequent interspecies contact at roosts, combined with phylogenetic proximity of host species is likely to promote inter-species transmission in a context of viral diversification induced by the intense circulation of alphacoronaviruses in Myotis spp.",

More specifically, Myotis emarginatus regularly forms mixed clusters with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum but so far, no Betacoronavirus has ever been isolated from the former. A possible hypothesis to explain this would be that an evolutionary trade-off maintains Betacoronavirus EPI1 adapted to its host species. In such a context, a spill-over to Myotis species, divergent by >60 million years, would require a major change that, albeit still possible, would be unlikely to occur. In addition, the frequency of contact between Rhinolophus and Myotis may not be high enough to give this spill-over a sufficient probability to be observed as yet. Another hypothesis would point the intense circulation of diversified alphacoronaviruses in Myotis spp. as a trigger of a complex immunological repertoire directed toward alphacoronaviruses that may, to some extent, provide partial cross-protection against infection by Betacoronavirus EPI1. Given the behaviour of Myotis emarginatus, the species of the genus Myotis that is the most frequently observed roosting with Rhinolophus, this species may play the role of intermediate host for coronaviruses transmission between Myotis and Rhinolophus and would be the first species to test for an eventual Betacoronavirus inter-species jump from Rhinolophus to Myotis. Unfortunately, our sampling of Myotis emarginatus was limited and the occurrence of such a spill-over between the two species should be further investigated.",

Indeed, this association between these Alphacoronaviruses and Rhinolophidae can be extended to the whole clade rooted by Alphacoronavirus Hiparm Ratcha described in 2007 in Hipposideridae bats in Thailand. This clade has been detected in Asia and in eastern and western Europe in Rhinolophoidea only, and thus represents, to date, a unique example of coevolution between a clade of alphacoronaviruses and this bat super family (Gouilh et al., 2011, Drexler et al., 2010, Foley et al., 2015).",

Further studies are needed i) to better understand this difference of host specificity between the two groups, ii) to investigate the evolution patterns of this Betacoronavirus clade in bats in the Western Palearctic and iii) to estimate more precisely the likelihood of spill-over of these viruses through molecular epidemiology and gain-function testing. The SARS-related Betacoronavirus EPI1 exhibits notable diversity across time and space which suggests a fast evolution. This therefore advocates for sustained surveillance and for intensifying studies on these coronaviruses so as to get a better understanding of their pattern of circulation in wildlife.

Statistical support (posterior probability) of nodes are depicted using a gradual color code of the tree, red indicating significant posterior probability values (>0.95). Labels of viruses detected in this study are bolded and coloured in blue. Corresponding host names are indicated in the right panel, in front of each taxa reported in the study. When significant mixing of species at the roost was observed, the name of the co-roosting coronavirus-negative species is added in brackets. Country of origin and identity score (ID) to the closest reference found in GenBank were also added for each coronavirus clade detected in this study.
