CMV viral- or peptide-specific stimulation in vitro expands single or multiple pathogen-specific vCTL. The advantages of culture over cell selection are the generation and expansion of polyclonal vCTL to clinically useful quantities of vCTL from small amounts of blood [31]. However, the major disadvantages of this strategy is the daunting task of culturing and processing after stimulation to expand the vCTL (up to more than 1 month) and the HLA-histocompatibility requirement of finding a closely matched donor. During these longer-term cultures, the vCTL may lose their capacity to self-renew and to persist in vivo, particularly after prolonged ex vivo culture [32]. It should be noted that clinical trials infusing ex vivo expanded vCTL post-HSCT showed prolonged persistence [33] and that ex vivo expansion using pathogen-specific stimuli decreased alloreactivity [19]. This may be due to selection of virus-specific clones and deselection of alloreactive clones. One study showed that residual alloreactivity seen in vCTL is clinically insignificant [34]. The initial trials of vCTL therapy required CMV lysates on APC, CMV-infected fibroblasts, or EBV-lymphoblastoid cells lines as a stimulant for expansion of donor-derived memory T cells [25, 27, 35]. The discovery of dominant and highly conserved antigens such as CMV-pp65 and adenovirus hexon and penton led to replacement of live viral stimulation with either 15-mer peptide pools spanning viral proteins or DNA plasmid-transduced antigen-presenting cells [36, 37]. The newer approaches to rapidly expand and manipulate APCs enabled use of a less restricted population of donors and the targeting of an increased number of pathogens in a single culture [20, 38]. In a recent rapid vCTL protocol, the addition of IL-4 and IL-7 leads to production of CD4+ T cells with a Th1 phenotype, whereas IL-2 and IL-15 tended to favor in vitro natural killer (NK) cell expansion [37]. The ideal population to adoptively transfer may be ex vivo expanded central memory T cells with a CD62L and CD45RA phenotype as these cells have a superior ability to persist in vivo after adoptive transfer [39, 40].",

            "text": "\nDirect selection\nrelies on cell sorting of immune donor PBMCs, usually after pulsing them with the antigen(s) of interest, to drive expansion of virus-specific T-cell clones [41]. This approach would not be viable for obtaining immune CTLs from pathogen-naive donors. Multimer selection is achieved by binding of HLA-peptide complexes to T-cell receptors (TCRs) of known antigen specificity, followed by purification of bound cells, e.g., by magnetic column separation. Alternatively, antiviral T cells expressing interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) can be isolated using the gamma capture assay. Direct selection methods have the advantage of rapid manufacturing time. Unfortunately, these approaches require apheresis of donors in order to collect sufficient cells for sorting and processing for clinical applications and pre-existing and detectable pathogen-specific T cells in the blood. Multimer selection is major histocompatibility (MHC)-restricted and selects only CD8+ T cells of a limited specificity. This could possibly allow pathogen evasion and impair persistence of vCTL in vivo [42]. Earlier studies suggested that persistent binding of multimers to the TCR may impair T-cell function [43]. Recent reversible Streptamer technology for direct selection may overcome the problem of impaired function [44]. IFN-\u03b3 positive selection captures polyclonal antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and selects for a wider range of antigen-specific cells. Combining direct selection, culture expansion methods, and cytokine cocktails can optimize the selection of central memory T cells in vCTL products and improve yields on targeted cellular phenotypes [37, 44].",

High-affinity TCR genes can be cloned and transduced into polyclonal T cells to generate a large population of TCR pathogen-specific CTLs [45]. A similar strategy was used to produce tumor-specific T cells after TCR gene transfer [18]. In contrast, CARs have an extracellular region that consists of a scFv that binds to antigen, with an intracellular signaling complex composed of TCR zeta chain for first-generation CARs, the TCR zeta chain and the CD28 for second-generation CARs, and TCR zeta and CD28 or 41BB for third-generation CARs [46\u201348]. The high-affinity TCR-transduced CTLs have been used to target CMV-infected cells [49], HPV-infected cells [50], hepatitis B-infected cells [51], hepatitis C-infected cells [52], tuberculosis-infected cells [53], SARS-infected cells [54], chlamydia-infected cells [55], and HIV-infected cells [56].

            "text": "The strategy for using bispecific antibodies (BiAbs)\nto target cancer was nearly abandoned due to cytokine storm reactions. However, the last 10 years has seen a resurrection of interest particularly for targeting T cells to various cancer antigens. Studies using retargeted T cells have been reported for HER2 in breast and prostate cancer using anti-CD3 x anti-Her2 BiAb ATC [89, 90]; EGFR in colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer using anti-CD3 x anti-EGFR BiAb ATC [91]; and CD20 in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma using anti-CD3 x anti-CD20 BiAb ATC [92\u201394]. Since chemical or molecularly engineered constructs could be used to target the TCR on one hand and tumor-associated antigen (TAA) on the other hand, we reasoned that CMV could be targeted by chemically heteroconjugating OKT3 (anti-CD3, anti-TCR) with Cytogam\u00ae (polyclonal donor-derived anti-CMV IgG, designated CMVBi) to kill CMV-infected fibroblasts [95]. In this strategy shown in Fig. 20.1, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody-activated T cells (ATC) which expanded in low-dose IL-2 were the T effector cells. ATC alone do not kill CMV-infected targets. Arming doses of CMVBi ranging from as low as 0.01 ng/106 ATC to 50 ng/106ATC exhibited high levels of specific anti-CMV cytotoxicity in targets infected with CMV at multiplicities of CMV infection (MOI) ranging from 0.01 to 1. The polyclonal nature of the Cytogam may provide multiple antibody clones directed at multiple CMV epitopes on the CMV-infected targets leading to the increased potency at a low arming dose of CMVBi. Cytotoxicity was evident at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 25:1, 13:1, 6:1, and 3:1 compared to unarmed ATC alone. At an MOI of 1.0, the mean % specific anti-CMV-specific cytotoxicities at E:T of 3, 6, and 13 were 79%, 81%, and 82%, respectively, whereas unarmed ATC at the same E:Ts killed <20%. Unarmed ATC, Cytogam\u00ae, or CMVBi alone did not exhibit significant killing of uninfected or CMV-infected fibroblasts. Furthermore, cultures of CMVBi-armed ATC with CMV-infected targets induced cytokine and chemokine release from CMVBi-armed ATC. This simple targeting strategy bypasses MHC-restricted cytotoxicity for treating viral disease in organ transplant and HSCT recipients. It was shown that CMVBi ATC do not react to alloantigens in vitro in a mixed lymphocyte culture, and they can be frozen and reinfused at different time points as an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d drug. Although promising, it is not clear from these data whether targeting CMV or other disease agents using this approach\nwill be clinically effective.",

CMV, EBV, and Adv are the three leading causes of viral-associated mortality after allogeneic HSCT. Clinical-grade Adv vector Ad5f35pp65 contains the immunodominant CMV antigen pp65, providing a unique opportunity to transduce donor-derived dendritic cells or EBV-LCL to serve as APCs for the CTL cultures. Triviral (CMV, EBV, and Adv-specific) CTLs were tested in a dose-escalation trial involving 26 patients [83]. There were no adverse effects at doses ranging from 5 \u00d7 106 to 1 \u00d7 108 cells/m2, and all patients were effectively protected against CMV, EBV, and Adv. Interestingly, although EBV- and CMV-specific CTLs were detected by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpots, Adv-CTLs were not detectable except during infection. In a follow-up trial using Ad5f35-transduced EBV-LCL to produce EBV- and Adv-CTLs, 13 patients received prophylaxis or treatment for EBV and Adv infections after HSCT [21]. Although the CTLs provided protection in vivo, the Adv-CTLs could not be detected except in the setting of Adv infection; these data suggest that levels of specific vCTLs below the limits of detection by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpots provide protection and infection induces clonal expansion. Similarly, Ad5f35pp65 transduced dendritic cells (DC) used to produce CMV- and Adv-CTLs were clinically effective in 12 patients after allogeneic HSCT [84]. There were a few cases of CMV reactivation in the setting of low-dose prednisone. This approach was applied to 50 patients after allogeneic HSCT with triviral (CMV, EBV, Adv-specific) CTLs\nusing two methods: 10 were produced by pulsing donor DCs with the HLA-A2 restricted CMV peptide NLVPMVATV and 40 were produced using Ad5f35pp65-transduced donor DCs [87]. Only 5 of 50 patients had CMV reactivation after CTL infusions and only 1 of 5 patients required antiviral drug therapy after steroid treatment for acute GVHD.",

The use of gas-permeable rapid-expansion (G-Rex) bioreactors has simplified CTL culture [96]. These advances in technology led to the development of a rapid manufacturing protocol for expanding virus-specific T-cell products (VSTs) that yield clinically relevant numbers of VSTs in 10\u201312 days. Further, VST products targeting multiple viral antigens have been shown to provide effective antiviral protection (against CNV, EBV and Ad) in ten patients after HSCT [37]. This rapid manufacturing protocol was subsequently adapted to produce five virus-specific CTLs targeting EBV, CMV, Adv, HHV6, and BK virus infections in a single T-cell product for patients following allogeneic HSCT [88]. Fourteen of 48 VST products manufactured from HSCT donors recognized all 5 viral components while 35 (73%) recognized 3 or more by IFN-\u03b3 ELISpots. Unexpectedly 22 of the donors were CMV seronegative and VSTs produced predictably lacked CMV specificity. These VSTs were used to treat 11 patients after HSCT. The 3 patients treated prophylactically remained free of viral infections and 8 patients with 18 viral reactivations received VSTs, with all experiencing partial\nor complete responses in their CMV, EBV, Adv, or HHV6 infections.",

A larger number of clinical trials focused on genetically modified CTL to target HIV using transduction of a modified TCR or CARs. These trials established safety, but exhibited limited antiviral efficacy [76, 77]. A major challenge for this approach is the outgrowth of escape mutants expressing alterations of the target epitope so the infected cell can no longer be targeted by the effector cells. A more successful approach has been inserting genes that would provide HIV resistance. This approach was clinically tested when antisense gene complementary to HIV env was transduced into T cells from 17 patients using lentiviral vectors [78].

One strategy to address this problem is to provide \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d pathogen-specific CTLs derived from third-party donors. This strategy was first validated in a phase I trial involving 8 patients who received partially matched EBV-CTLs for PTLD that developed after solid organ transplantation [66, 67] and confirmed in a cohort of 33 patients in a phase II trial [68]. The latter trial showed a response rate of 64% at 5 weeks and 52% at 6 months; the outcomes correlated with the degree of HLA matching between the CTL donor and recipient. In the HSCT patients, two patients with refractory EBV-PTLD after cord blood transplantation (CBT) with third-party EBV-specific CTLs [71]. A bank of 32 CTL lines with characterized activity against EBV, CMV, and Adv were used to match for 50 patients with refractory viral infections. This strategy resulted in partial or complete antiviral responses in 74%, 78%, and 67% of those with CMV, Adv, and EBV, respectively [85]. This is a marked improvement from standard therapy response rate of 13% in eight patients for whom a matched line could not be identified. Despite partial HLA matching at one to four loci, there were only two patients who developed grade I GVHD. Clones that are responsible for GVHD have been selected against in the expansion culture and may exist at such low precursor frequencies after culture that they do not expand enough to cause clinically significant GVHD. The lower rate of response against EBV relative to CMV and Adv may reflect selective expansion of T cells against immunodominant epitopes of the latter two viruses, thereby complicating the selection of an ideal third-party pathogen-specific line that fulfills the requirements of antiviral activity and MHC-restriction against multiple pathogens. The methods for producing third-party-virus-specific CTL include pentamer\nselection for Ad, CMV, EBV [81], and IFN-\u03b3 selection for Adv-CTL [73].",

Alternatively, Kumaresan et al. transduced T cells with the \u03b2-glucan receptor dectin [61]. Since the carbohydrate \u03b2-glucan is found in the cell wall of most fungi [103], investigators used its natural receptor, dectin-1, as a recognition receptor coupled to a CD28 (a key co-stimulatory molecule) and CD3-zeta transgene to initiate signaling and killing in T cells. The same group showed that the antifungal CARTs could mediate damage to hyphae in vitro and in vivo [61].

Candidal infections can range from mucocutaneous colonization of the skin and mouth to life-threatening systemic infections. Aspergillus species are ubiquitous molds that cause invasive pulmonary infections as well as widespread infection including central nervous system dissemination in highly immunocompromised patients [104]. Patients with inherited immunodeficiencies (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease), patients with prolonged neutropenia after repeated rounds of chemotherapy (e.g., for acute leukemia), and those receiving immunosuppression after lung transplant or allogeneic HSCT are at the highest risk for mycoses [105]. The importance of T-cell immunity in defense against invasive aspergillosis and other filamentous fungi is not clear, since patients with these invasive fungal diseases usually have severe deficiencies in multiple components of the immune system. In patients with advanced AIDS, invasive aspergillosis is an uncommon complication and generally occurs when other forms of immune impairment (e.g., neutropenia and use of corticosteroids) are present. Despite these unknowns, it may be clinically useful to target fungal infections with fungus-specific T cells after HSCT.",

Table 20.2 summarizes preclinical studies that developed fungal-specific CTLs against Candida, Aspergillus, and Rhizopus (a member of the Mucorales group) species. Aspergillus-specific CTLs were produced by stimulation of PBMC with antigens from aspergillus extracts, selection with IFN-\u03b3 secretion, and culture [106]. The CTLs were predominantly CD4+, CD45R0+ memory cells that secrete IFN-\u0263 in response to Aspergillus and Penicillium. The fungal-specific CTL enhanced hyphal damage by neutrophils and APCs. IFN-\u0263 selection and stimulation with Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Rhizopus oryzae extracts were used to produce multifungal-specific CTL lines, which were also nearly all CD4+ CD45RO+ HLA-DR+ that exhibited activation markers of IFN-\u0263, CD154, and TNF\u03b1 and enhanced oxidative activity of neutrophils when co-incubated with antigen and APCs [108]. Several studies target the Candida MP65 and Aspergillus CRF1 antigens. To produce multi-pathogen-specific T cells that secrete IFN-\u0263, proliferate, and kill CMV, EBV, Adv, Candida, and Aspergillus, donor PBMCs were incubated with peptide libraries from CMV-pp65, EBV-LMP2, Adv-Hexon, Candida MP65, and a 15-mer peptide from aspergillus CRF1 [107]. However, it remains unclear what the significance of MP65 and CRF1 is in antifungal immunity [117] [113]. Expanded memory/effector Th1 cells following stimulation with Rhizopus extracts were used to generate memory/effector Th1 cells for mucormycosis, and the product exhibited specificity to the original Rhizopus oryzae extract as well as other Mucorales species [118]. Candida-specific T cells generated with cellular extracts of Candida albicans released cytokines that caused hyphal damage and increased neutrophil activity against hyphae [111].\n",
