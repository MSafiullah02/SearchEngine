            "text": "Within the Bornaviridae family, there is only the genus Bornavirus, which includes the Borna disease virus (BDV). BDV has been shown to infect a wide range of vertebrates, causing encephalitis and behavioral abnormalities (Ludwig and Bode 2000; Richt and Rott 2001; Lipkin et al. 2011). Although its pathogenicity in humans is controversial, possible links to depression, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome and aggressive brain tumors have been suggested (Ludwig and Bode 2000; Ikuta et al. 2002; Lipkin et al. 2011). Tunicamycin treatment inhibited production of infectious BDV, and glycosidase treatment eliminated virus infectivity, suggesting that glycans play a significant role in BDV pathogenicity (Stoyloff et al. 1994). There are two reported glycosylated BDV proteins. The first is gp18 (or p16), which was initially suggested to be an integral membrane matrix-like GP (Hatalski et al. 1995; Stoyloff et al. 1997). Gp18 was later proposed to be nonglycosylated and to only line the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, as do the typical cytoplasmic matrix proteins of the Mononegavirales (Kraus et al. 2001). Gp18 is suggested to be essential for infection and includes epitopes important for virus neutralization (Kliche et al. 1994; Hatalski et al. 1995; Stoyloff et al. 1997). Both lectin-binding and endoglycosidase digestion assays have shown the matrix protein to be N- but not O-glycosylated (Kliche et al. 1994). The specific effects of these N-glycans in BDV infection and potential neutralization, however, are still unknown. The second glycosylated protein in BDV is the G GP (p56), which is thought to have roles in receptor binding and viral entry. BDV G has been shown to contain N-glycans, but no O-glycans, and the specific functions of the N-glycans remain unknown (Gonzalez-Dunia et al. 1997; Schneider et al. 1997).",

It has been suggested that the thick glycan layer created around GP by the glycan cap and MLD helps in antibody evasion (Lee et al. 2008). In support of this hypothesis, mutation of two N-glycosylation sites increased immunogenicity, possibly by unmasking epitopes normally covered by glycans (Dowling et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Remarkably, all 15 N-glycosylation sites from GP1 have been successfully mutated concurrently without affecting GP expression (Lennemann et al. 2014). N-glycan removal did, however, increase protease sensitivity, antibody sensitivity and transduction of pseudotyped virions into cells, suggesting that N-glycans protect against proteases and shield against antibody immune responses at the expense of viral entry efficiency (Lennemann et al. 2014). Single N-glycosylation site mutations asparagine to aspartate (N to D), however, were found to have similar processing, expression and transduction levels as wild-type virus (Jeffers et al. 2002). One mutant, N40D, did display less processing and no transduction. Loss of the same N-glycan via a T42D mutation, however, did not result in an altered phenotype, suggesting that the effects observed for the N40D mutant were most likely due to a change in protein conformation (as this site is near a cysteine residue) and not due to loss of the N-glycan itself (Jeffers et al. 2002). Additionally, D is not the most ideal substitution since it introduces a negative charge in addition to the loss of the N-glycan. A separate study, however, found T42A or N40K mutants to be cathepsin B resistant, suggesting that the N40 glycan is important for GP cleavage and processing (Wong et al. 2010). Additionally, the amount of N-glycan processing can also determine which receptors GP will bind. High-mannose N-glycans allow DC-SIGN lectin binding (Lin et al. 2003; Marzi et al. 2006; Powlesland et al. 2008), while the lectin LSECTIN does not recognize high-mannose glycan forms (Gramberg et al. 2005) and has been shown to bind truncated N-glycans (Powlesland et al. 2008). Thus, N-glycans clearly play a role in receptor binding and proper GP cleavage, and these functions may or may not have a direct role in viral entry by modulating receptor-induced membrane fusion.",

Deletion of the entire MLD resulted in increased processing, incorporation and viral entry using a retroviral system expressing EBOV GP. Deletion of this O-glycan-rich region also decreased cellular detachment capabilities, abolished cytopathic effects both in vitro and in vivo and reduced immune responses in mice (Yang et al. 2000; Jeffers et al. 2002; Simmons et al. 2002; Dowling et al. 2007). However, since the MLD region is 188 amino acids in length, it is possible that deletion of this region affected the GP conformation (Tran et al. 2014). In virus-like particles (VLPs) studies, immunization of mice with VLPs expressing full-length GP elicited higher antiviral titers than immunization with VLPs expressing an MLD-deleted GP (Martinez et al. 2011). Additionally, epitopes of protective monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were mapped to a domain C-terminal of the GP O-glycan-rich region (Wilson et al. 2000). The use of two different models, a retroviral system and VLPs, both highly suggest the MLD is important for an immune response, at least in mice, in addition to playing roles in viral infectivity. It should be noted that many of these studies deleted the entire O-glycan region, and thus, it remains unclear if the loss of O-glycans and/or the loss of the amino acid backbone caused the observed effects. In addition, there are N-glycans within the MLD that may partially contribute to the phenotypes observed.",

Interestingly, sGP uses five of its six potential N-glycosylation sites and contains no O-glycans (Falzarano et al. 2006; Ritchie et al. 2010). The sGP N-glycans are more processed (containing more complex carbohydrates) than those on GP1, but the reasons for these differences in processing are still undetermined (Lennemann et al. 2014; Ritchie et al. 2010).

With less research done on Marburg virus and LLOV, it is difficult to determine if the functions of these glycans demonstrated for EBOV are conserved among the Filoviridae. It is interesting to note that the EBOV N-glycans do not appear to play important roles in cell surface expression (CSE), a difference from other mononegaviruses such as many paramyxoviruses. However, filovirus N-glycans do seem to modulate protease sensitivity and thus protein processing. It appears that the O-glycan-rich region is involved more heavily in many of these functions, but since most studies so far deleted this entire region, it remains to be determined whether the O-glycans themselves are responsible for the phenotypes observed.",

Studies in Lec1 cells, a cell line lacking the enzymes necessary to convert high-mannose N-glycans to complex or hybrid forms, suggest that APMV-1 fusion and infection are not dependent on hybrid or complex N-glycans. This suggests that high-mannose N-glycans may play a role in cell\u2013cell fusion, however, the folding of these GPs was not studied (Sun et al. 2012).",

N to Q mutations caused altered fusion activity (usually lower, but one double mutant had increased fusogenicity), and all were less virulent (Panda et al. 2004), an interesting result since fusogenicity often directly correlates with virulence. The N481 mutant had lowered CSE, suggesting that the most C-terminal N-glycan is important for processing and/or transport. None of the mutants had altered cell receptor-binding abilities, though two had decreased neuraminidase activities, suggesting that the decreased virulence of these mutants may be due, at least partially, to a decreased cellular detachment ability (Panda et al. 2004). Furthermore, it has been shown that failure to form a disulfide bond results in an additional N-glycosylation, possibly by causing differential folding that exposes an otherwise obscured site to glycosyltransferases (McGinnes and Morrison 1997). However, when a D287N mutation introduced an N-glycan the effect of neutralizing antibodies was reduced. Interestingly, the D287N mutation also reduced fusion from within (fusion induced by infected cells) and increased fusion from without (cell\u2013cell fusion mediated by virus at a high multiplicity of infection). Overall, addition of the N-glycan caused diminished syncytium formation as compared to wild-type HN and enabled the virus to escape from neutralizing MAbs specific for antigenic site 3 (Deng et al. 1994). The effects of this additional glycosylation on virulence and pathogenicity, however, are still somewhat unclear.",

The same N-glycosylation sites are used in HeV F, and similarly, of these, the equivalent N-glycan as for NiV (N414 in HeV) is important for proper folding and transport, while the removal of the N464 N-glycan yielded an increase in fusion, the other two had no significant effect on fusion (Carter et al. 2005), an interesting difference from NiV. Additionally, Galectin-1, a lectin that binds primarily a specific N-glycan in NiV F, inhibited NiV cell\u2013cell fusion if added post-infection but enhanced viral entry if present at the time of infection by increasing viral attachment to target cells (Garner et al. 2010, 2015; Levroney et al. 2005), demonstrating the importance of the timing of viral exposure to this innate immune factor.",

The removal of N-glycans from the head region of NiV G generally resulted in increased fusion, with some synergistic effects observed for double or triple mutants, which had higher fusion levels than their individual site counterparts. These mutants were also more susceptible to antibody neutralization, similar to NiV F N-glycans. In contrast, the removal of an N-glycan in the NiV G stalk created a fusion-dead mutant, even in combination with the removal of N-glycans from sites that created hyperfusogenic mutants when removed on their own. NiV G N-glycan removal also affected viral entry and binding avidities with NiV F, though protein conformations and receptor-binding capabilities were not significantly affected (Biering et al. 2012). The removal of N-glycans from HeV G revealed similar trends. However, simultaneous removal of multiple N-glycans from HeV resulted in a much stronger reduction in CSE than from NiV. Additionally, the removal of the N306 and N378 N-glycans from HeV G resulted in higher cell\u2013cell fusion levels than for NiV, while the removal of the N481 and N529 N-glycans of NiV caused higher fusion levels than for HeV (Bradel-Tretheway et al. 2015). These differences suggest conformational or functional differences for the same N-glycans in the two closely related viruses and/or differences in glycan branching/composition. Mass spectrometry analysis of a soluble HeV G showed it contained mainly complex N-glycans (Colgrave et al. 2012), but a similar mass spectrometry analysis has not been performed for NiV G.",

(2016). HeV G has been shown to contain O-glycans via mass spectrometry (Colgrave et al. 2012). Loss of specific O-glycosylation sites from the HeV G stalk affected cell\u2013cell fusion, protein conformational changes, binding avidities with HeV F, pseudotyped viral entry, and quite interestingly, HeV F protein processing and incorporation into pseudotyped virions (Stone et al. 2016). Since F and G are thought not to interact until reaching the cell surface, it is quite interesting that loss of an O-glycan on G affects F incorporation into virions, especially since this effect was observed in pseudotyped virions but not in cell lysates. Similar effects were observed for the same O-glycan mutants in NiV G, with the exception that interestingly, NiV F incorporation into pseudotyped virions and pseudotyped viral entry were not altered by the loss of O-glycans on NiV G. Additionally, one mutant in NiV G was unable to express at the cell surface even though its HeV G counterpart expressed at wild-type G levels (Stone et al. 2016). Loss of an O-glycan in either HeV or NiV G had no effect on antibody neutralization susceptibility, demonstrating functional differences between N- and O-glycans for the Henipaviruses. Additionally, O-glycans were shown not to affect G oligomerization. All these results suggest the importance of both N- and O-glycans in the henipavirus life cycle, though there appears to be subtle differences of their effects between NiV and HeV.",

Treatment with an \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine, revealed that trimming of glucose residues within the ER was required for syncytia formation and for infectivity (Malvoisin and Wild 1994; Bolt et al. 1999). Additionally, tunicamycin treatment to block N-glycan synthesis inhibited virion particle formation (Stallcup and Fields 1981). All three potential MeV F N-glycosylation sites are glycosylated and N-glycan removal from any resulted in loss of protein CSE and/or processing (Alkhatib et al. 1994; von Messling and Cattaneo 2003). Nonconservative mutations (N to S) of N29 and/or N61 resulted in a lack of MeV F processing and transport to the cell surface (Hu et al. 1995). Results were similar for conservative mutations (N to Q), as N-glycan loss resulted in reduced MeV F CSE (Alkhatib et al. 1994). Interestingly, mutant N61Q still had fusion activity, while mutant N29Q did not, a finding differing from the N to S mutations where neither mutant was fusogenic, suggesting that the loss of fusion for mutant N61S was due to the loss of the N residue and not the glycan. Mutation N67Q alone did not affect protein processing or fusogenicity but combined with the loss of either of the other two glycans resulted in impaired cleavage, stability, CSE, processing and fusion (Alkhatib et al. 1994). These results highlight the importance and partial flexibility of N-glycans on MeV F for proper protein processing, expression and function.",

Two of the four N-glycans affect GP conformation, as measured by conformational MAbs. No individual N-glycan affected folding, oligomerization or transport, but the presence of at least two of the four N-glycans were necessary for these functions, suggesting transport and folding are not dependent on a specific carbohydrate chain but do rely on a collective carbohydrate functions (Hu et al. 1994). Crystallization data suggest that N-glycans may modulate receptor binding by positioning MeV H for receptor binding (Hashiguchi et al. 2007). Supporting this notion, MeV H binding to the CD46 receptor was shown to be dependent on N-glycans, but not O-glycans, on MeV H, suggesting that N-glycans help keep MeV H in a conformation recognized by CD46. Likewise, the CD46 receptor also requires N-glycans to serve as the receptor for MeV H (Maisner et al. 1994, 1996; Maisner and Herrler 1995). However, it has been argued that CD46 is not a relevant in vivo receptor (Noyce and Richardson 2012), thus the biological significance of these findings remains to be determined. The effects of glycosylation on MeV H interactions with signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) or Nectin 4, the two other known and biologically relevant receptors of MeV, have not been reported. Regardless, N-glycans on MeV H appear to play a general role in keeping MeV H in a favorable functional conformation.",

Loss of all N-glycosylation sites from CDV H using N to Q mutations resulted in a functional and immunosuppressive CDV H GP, but one that no longer caused disease (Sawatsky and von Messling 2010). It has also been suggested that lack of N-glycans on the attenuated vaccine strain may be responsible for the loss of virulence (Iwatsuki et al. 1997). These results support the importance of N-glycans in GP function, pathogenicity and vaccine development. Notably, N-glycan presence appears to be more conserved between Morbillivirus F GPs (three out of three sites for both MeV and CDV, all in conserved positions) than between the H GPs (four out of five on MeV, and up to eight on CDV), suggesting that H is under higher host immune pressure.",

High-mannose sugars are thought to be necessary for the immunoreactivity of SeV F, but not SeV HN (Mottet et al. 1986). Additionally, tunicamycin treatment inhibited SeV viral replication (Nakamura et al. 1982). Thus, it is clear that N-glycans play a significant role in protein processing, proper viral function for these viruses, and that targeting these glycans may be a potential therapeutic option.",

However, the removal of any of the four F1 subunit N-glycans resulted in protein degradation, instability and delayed intracellular transport, CSE and fusion (Bagai and Lamb 1995). PIV-5 HN contains four N-glycans that affect protein folding and assembly in a cumulative manner. Additionally, one of these four N-glycans prevents aggregation of oligomers in the ER (Ng et al. 1990).

Before the introduction of a vaccine, mumps was a common childhood infection (Rubin et al. 2015). Tunicamycin treatment inhibits viral release, likely by trapping viral GPs in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Both the HN and F GPs are N-glycosylated with both complex and high-mannose glycans (HN and F1 subunit) or only high mannose (F2 subunit), as revealed by endoglycosidase treatments (Herrler and Compans 1983). MuV F contains six potential N-glycosylation sites (Alirezaie et al. 2008), while MuV HN contains five to seven potential N-glycosylation sites (Lim et al. 2003; Yates et al. 1996), though site utilization and functions remain unknown.

N-glycans commonly appear to have roles in protein expression, processing, trafficking to the cell surface, cell\u2013cell fusion and production of infectious virions. Additionally, many N-glycans also affect pathogenicity and immunogenicity. Some, such as the glycans on HPIV3 HN, affect receptor binding, while others have no effect on receptor binding at all but affect cellular detachment. Additionally, O-glycans have been detected on some paramyxoviral GPs, and their functions so far have only been determined for NiV and HeV G GPs.

It is estimated that most children will have at least one HRSV infection by the age of 2 (Borchers et al. 2013). Interestingly, for HRSV, only the fusion GP is required for cell\u2013cell fusion and viral entry to occur, though the presence of HRSV G enhances fusion (Chang and Dutch 2012). HRSV infectivity is sensitive to N- or O-glycan removal (Lambert 1988). HRSV F utilizes three of its six potential N-glycosylation sites. The removal of these N-glycans through conservative N to Q mutations did not affect HRSV F expression or processing (cleavage activation). However, one mutant, N70Q, had a 40% increase in fusion, while another mutant, N500Q, had a 90% fusion reduction. A mutant lacking all three N-glycosylation sites had almost no fusion (Zimmer et al. 2001). Since conformations of these proteins were not tested, it is possible that the altered fusion phenotypes were due to altered protein conformations. Conformational MAbs may help determine if this is the case. Importantly, it is still unknown whether HRSV F glycans affect the binding of HRSV F to palivizumab, a therapeutic MAb against HRSV and to our knowledge still the only MAb approved for use in humans against any virus.",

O-glycans have been shown not to be involved in HRSV G oligomerization (Collins and Mottet 1992). Additionally, modeling studies suggest a positive selection of certain O-glycans in response to immune pressure (Zlateva et al. 2004), suggesting that viral glycosylation may play an important role in the host immune response.

Infection generally occurs during childhood, but can be recurrent throughout life. In addition to infecting children, HMPV also poses a threat to immunocompromised individuals, including the elderly (Panda et al. 2014). HMPV F utilizes all three potential N-glycosylation sites: one on the F2 and two on the F1 subunits. N to A mutations resulted in decreased cell\u2013cell fusion, most likely caused by reduced F cleavage, and all mutants expressed well at the cell surface (Schowalter et al. 2006). In another study, mutants lacking the most C-terminal N-glycan, N353, either alone or in combination with the removal of other N-glycosylation sites did not produce virions (Zhang et al. 2011). Although N to Q vs. N to A mutations as well as virus vs. transfected cells were significant differences between these two studies, it appears that N-glycans on HMPV F affect cleavage of F into its F1 and F2 subunits, impacting viral replication and cell\u2013cell fusion (Schowalter et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2011). Viruses lacking the N172 glycan displayed impaired growth in vitro and in vivo and reduced pathology in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice (Zhang et al. 2011; Yu et al. 2012). Administration of a live vaccine attenuated by the loss of the N172 glycan resulted in immune protection in mice (Liu et al. 2013), highlighting the ways in which knowledge of viral glycosylation can aid viral infection prevention strategies.",

The cytorhabdovirus lettuce necrotic yellow virus (LNYV) G contains three potential N-glycosylation sites, while the Northern cereal mosaic virus (NCMV) contains six (Goldberg et al. 1991; Tanno et al. 2000; Jackson et al. 2005; Dietzgen et al. 2006). The nucleorhabdoviruses rice yellow stunt virus (RYSV) and sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV) contain 10 and 6 potential N-glycosylation sites, respectively (Jackson et al. 2005). Tunicamycin treatment suggests that at least some of these N-glycosylation sites are used (Jackson et al. 2005). Interestingly, there is very little sequence homology between NCMV and SYNV G, yet they are both potentially glycosylated at similar sites, suggesting the importance of glycosylation site conservation (Tanno et al. 2000).

            "text": "RABV infects most mammals and is transmitted through bites, scratches and saliva. Infection is characterized by neurological symptoms culminating in severe encephalitis and is fatal in humans if untreated (Calisher and Ellison 2012). RABV G usually contains one (N319) N-glycosylation site highly conserved among different RABV strains (Wunner et al. 1985, 1988; Badrane and Tordo 2001; Yamada et al. 2012). Additionally, an N-glycan at site N247 is found in many lab-adapted strains (Wunner et al. 1985). It has been suggested that the latter N-glycan may play a role in the reduced pathogenicity observed in many of these lab-adapted strains and possibly the increased efficiency for growth in cell culture (Yamada et al. 2012, 2014a). Further, N37 is inefficiently glycosylated and efforts to increase N-glycosylation efficiency reduced pathogenicity of the virus (Wunner et al. 1985; Shakin-Eshleman et al. 1992, 1993; Yamada et al. 2014b). Loss of the N-glycan at N319 resulted in decreased viral production and an inability for RABV G to fold correctly that inhibited membrane fusion (Yamada et al. 2013). Deletion of all three N-glycans completely blocked CSE. A mutant containing only the N37 glycan was still able to express on the cell surface, suggesting that this inefficiently glycosylated site is not important for CSE (Shakin-Eshleman et al. 1992). Addition of an extra N-glycan (N194), created from spontaneous mutation during serial passage, increased virus production (Yamada et al. 2013). Thus, it appears that N-glycans play a crucial role in proper RABV G CSE, though the combined effects of glycans at all the N-glycan sites suggest a crucial balance where too few or too many N-glycans negatively impact viral pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Tunicamycin treatment blocked CSE of RABV G but not intracellular synthesis (Burger et al. 1991; Wojczyk et al. 1995). Additionally, experiments with a panel of various CHO cell lines deficient for different steps in the N-glycan processing pathway revealed that RABV G expression was independent of the type of N-glycan processing, as all cell lines expressed RABV G on the cell surface (Burger et al. 1991). It is still possible that RABV G trafficked at different rates, as the timing of RABV G CSE was not explored. Notably, mutation of site N247 facilitated an additional glycosylation of site N319 (Wojczyk et al. 2005). Recombinant RABV G protein produced in eukaryotic cells (and thus glycosylated) was effective as a vaccine (Kieny et al. 1984; Wiktor et al. 1984), while RABV G protein produced in prokaryotic cells (and thus not glycosylated) was not effective (Yelverton et al. 1983). While these differences could be due to other factors such as protein conformation, it is possible that proper glycosylation of RABV G is necessary for effective immune responses. However, another study indicated that glycans may not be a required target for mouse antibodies (Wunner et al. 1985), suggesting that the immunoreactivity of RABV G is multifactorial. Undoubtedly, N-glycans play a critical role in at least proper CSE of RABV G, though their effects on the host immune response merit further exploration.",

VSV is also used extensively in the production of pseudotyped viruses due to its ability to incorporate viral GPs from many other viral families (Huang et al. 1974; Witte and Baltimore 1977). VSV GP (G) contains two well-conserved N-glycosylation sites (N181 and N336), which make up approximately 10% of the GP\u2019s mass, and no O-glycosylation sites have been discovered (Etchison and Holland 1974a, 1974b; Robertson et al. 1976; Reading et al. 1978; Farley et al. 2007). Tunicamycin treatment, particularly of the San Juan strain, impaired intracellular transport of VSV G to the plasma membrane (Leavitt et al. 1977a; Morrison et al. 1978; Gibson et al. 1979), inhibited viral replication (Leavitt et al. 1977b) and altered MAb-binding patterns to the VSV G GP (Grigera et al. 1991). However, these effects appeared to be partially strain-specific, as tunicamycin treatment of the New Jersey strain slowed the folding rate of VSV G but did not prevent its eventual expression at the cell surface (Mathieu et al. 1996). Additionally, the Orsay strain showed some resistance to tunicamycin treatment (Gibson et al. 1979).",

It was also shown that either of the two N-glycans was necessary and sufficient for proper G transport, (Machamer et al. 1985). This observation is further supported by a naturally occurring mutant containing only one N-glycan that trafficked properly to the cell surface (Kotwal et al. 1986). It was also observed that the addition of new N-glycosylation sites to unglycosylated VSV G allowed for transport of G to the plasma membrane, though this restored transport ability was only successful for two of the six engineered N-glycosylation sites (Machamer and Rose 1988a).",

It has been observed that low amounts of infectious virus are produced even in the presence of tunicamycin and it is possible that some glycan mutant virions with different conformations may thus be able to traffic to the cell surface despite a lack of glycosylation (Gibson et al. 1978). This may also explain why certain strains are more resistant to tunicamycin treatment than others, as different amino acid sequences may result in different conformations that are more or less reliant on N-glycans for their structural integrity (Chatis and Morrison 1981). Thus, it appears that either of the two natural N-glycan is necessary and sufficient for proper VSV G transport and expression, suggesting that proper GP conformation, and not specific N-glycans, is most important for VSV G expression and function.",

Indeed, sequence comparisons between RABV G and VSV G show approximately 20% overall sequence identity between these two GPs, yet greater than 50% identity around the most C-terminal N-glycosylation site, with exact alignment at the N-glycosylation site itself (Rose et al. 1982). For both genera, N-glycans appear to be necessary for proper transport to the cell surface, with one N-glycan being sufficient for the cell transport function (Machamer et al. 1985; Kotwal et al. 1986; Shakin-Eshleman et al. 1992). Additionally, dependence on N-glycans for proper trafficking is independent on the type of glycan processing, as evidenced by a variety of glycosylation-deficient CHO cells where the G GP was still expressed at the cell surface (Burger et al. 1991; Schlesinger et al. 1975; Robertson et al. 1978). The effects of N-glycans appear to be more strain-specific for VSV. Although RABV strains differ more in the number of N-glycans present, the effects of tunicamycin treatment appear to be more variable among VSV strains than among RABV strains. General comparisons among the other Rhabdoviruses are difficult to make since far fewer studies exist. However, these viruses could potentially contain more N-glycosylation sites than their lyssavirus and vesiculovirus counterparts, though studies determining site usage have yet to be undertaken.",

In recent years, many human illnesses, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer, have been linked to altered glycosylation (Varki and Freeze 2009; Varki, Kannagi et al. 2009). Glycosylation is commonly used by pathogens in host invasion and immune evasion. Within the Mononegavirales order there are many conserved functions of glycosylation, such as receptor binding, viral entry, protein processing or trafficking, cell\u2013cell fusion and immunogenicity (Table I, Figure 3), all important roles for the viral life cycle. It should be noted that much more has been discovered for N-glycans than O-glycans, partly due to the difficulty in determining O-glycosylation sites compared to N-glycosylation sites. Few O-glycan functions have been described. Many functions have been attributed to O-glycan-rich regions, such as that of the Ebola GP, yet these functions have yet to be directly attributed to the O-glycans themselves. In a new study for the Henipavirus genus, novel roles were shown for NiV and HeV O-glycans (Stone et al. 2016). It remains to be seen if such roles apply to other paramyxoviruses or mononegaviruses.\n",

Glycomimetics, compounds that mimic the bioactive properties of carbohydrates, are being developed and tested for a number of different viral infections (Ernst and Magnani 2009; Magnani and Ernst 2009). The glucose-mimetic N-9-methoxynonyl (DNJ), for example, inhibits a part of the glycosylation pathway, thus preventing viral GPs from folding properly (Francois and Balzarini 2012; Dalziel et al. 2014). DNJ has been shown to be effective in combating HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and has been suggested as a possible therapeutic against the flaviviruses dengue virus and West Nile virus (Merry and Astrautsova 2010). Carbohydrate mimetics are suggested to be good drug candidates because they generally have a low toxicity, are water soluble, can be easily modified by adding different functional groups at multiple locations and have the potential to be used as scaffolds for more complex drugs (Merry and Astrautsova 2010). However, carbohydrates generally have been thought to make poor drug candidates due to their high polarity, preventing passive transport through the intestinal lining (and thus problematic for oral dosing regimens). The use of carbohydrate mimetics enables sufficient manipulation to overcome this barrier (Ernst and Magnani 2009).",

Carbohydrate-binding agents cannot only bind the viral GPs to prevent entry but also can create a long-term selective pressure for viral strains with the protective N-glycan regions removed, thus making the virus more susceptible to immune system neutralization (Francois and Balzarini 2012). Lectins are also found naturally across a wide variety of species (prokaryotes, algae, fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). Thus, there are many different lectins to explore as potential viral inhibitors (Francois and Balzarini 2012). Antibodies against the carbohydrates of viral proteins, though less common, can also be effective. 2G12 is an antibody that binds an N-glycan region of gp120 on HIV, thus inhibiting viral entry into host cells and limiting HIV infections (Merry and Astrautsova 2010; Francois and Balzarini 2012).

Viral proteins and RNA are packaged into new virions, which are then released from the cell. These virions can then interact with the host immune system.
