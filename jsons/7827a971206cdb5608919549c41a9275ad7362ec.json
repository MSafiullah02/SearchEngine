Every cell consists of a cell membrane which encloses the cytoplasm, the DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) which acts as the carrier of the genetic information, and proteins and enzymes which catalyze cellular reactions and build up substructures inside the cell. Ribosomes represent the protein production machine and are found in both procaryotes and eucaryotes. Ribosomes are responsible for processing the genetic instructions and for converting the genetic code into the exact sequence of amino acids that make up a protein. Structures of higher complexity are, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The endoplasmic reticulum is the transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations. The Golgi apparatus is the central delivery system for the cell, and is a site for protein processing, packaging, and transport.",

            "text": "The cellular membrane is a lipid bilayer impermeable to ions and polar molecules, which acts as a barrier to define a biochemical environment inside the cytoplasm that differs from outside. Permeability is conferred by two classes of membrane proteins, channels and pumps. Channels enable ions to flow rapidly through membranes in a thermodynamically downhill direction. Pumps, by contrast, use a source of free energy such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) or light to drive the uphill transport of ions or molecules. One example for such a pump is bacteriorhodopsin (bR), which pumps protons across the cellular membrane against a proton gradient upon light absorption. The proton gradient can be harnessed to generate ATP from ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) by another membrane protein called ATP synthase. This process allows the bacterium Halobacterium salinarium, which is sketched in Fig. 9 .1, to survive under unfavorable conditions. In addition to proteins, peptidoglycan polymers consisting of sugars and amino acids, can form a homogeneous layer outside the plasma membrane giving the wall shape and structural strength, as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. The peptidoglycan layer is substantially thicker in Gram-positive bacteria (20 to 80 nm) than in Gram-negative bacteria (7 to 8 nm). Gram-positive bacteria are classified as bacteria that retain a crystal violet dye during the gram stain process. Gram-positive bacteria will appear blue or violet under a microscope, whereas gram-negative bacteria will appear red or pink. The difference in classification is largely based on a difference in the bacteria's cell wall structure and therefore in its composition (see Sect. 9.7).

There is a variety of important cofactors such as: i) ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the universal \"currency\" of free energy in biological systems; ii) NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FADH 2 (flavin adenine dinucleotide), the major electron carriers in the oxydation of \"fuel\" molecules, such as glucose and fatty acids; and iii) NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), the major electron donor in reductive biosynthesis. Proteins play crucial roles in virtually all biological processes. In enzymatic catalysis proteins usually increase reaction rates by at least a millionfold. They transport and store small molecules and ions, e.g., oxygen in haemoglobin. Proteins are responsible for coordinated motion, such as muscle contraction, by the sliding motion of two kinds of protein filaments, or the swimming of bacteria by rotation of flagellae (e.g., Fig.9 .1). Immune protection is accomplished by antibodies, which The bacterium spanning a length of some micrometers is sketched with its flagella on both sides; regions of the purple membrane (PM) containing the transmembrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR); lower panel; left side: top view of the bacteriorhodopsin proteins in the PM measured by X-ray diffraction [1, 2] ; right side: side view of bacteriorhodopsin with the retinal chromophore (purple) measured by electron-diffraction [3] .",

            "text": "All proteins are built from a repertoire of 20 amino acids. An amino acid consists of an amino group (NH 2 ), a carboxyl group (COOH), a hydrogen atom, and a R group, called residue or side chain. All groups are bonded to a carbon atom called \u03b1-carbon; and the tetrahedral array of the four different groups confers optical activity to amino acids, with two mirror-image forms called the L isomer and the D isomer. Almost only L isomers are constituents of natural proteins. The side chains R of the 20 amino acids differ in size, shape, charge, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and chemical reactivity. Two examples of amino acids are shown in Fig. 9 .2. Glycine has the simplest side chain with just a hydrogen atom. Tryptophan, on the other hand, has a longer side chain belonging to the aromatic side chains, and consisting of an indole joined to a methylene group (see Fig. 9 .2). In proteins, the \u03b1-carboxyl group of one amino acid is joined to the \u03b1-amino group of another amino acid forming a peptide bond (see Fig. 9 .2). The protein consists of a repetitive and a variable region. The main chain or protein backbone is a repetition of peptide bonds, whereas the side chains constitute the variable part. Most natural proteins contain anywhere from about ten to several thousands of amino acid residues and the sequence of each protein is unique. The sequence is called the primary structure, where small variations can lead to widely different three dimensional structures and biological functions. Three dimensional structural motifs are called secondary structures. They are determined by the interaction of peptide units \u2212C \u03b1 \u2212 (C = O) \u2212 (N \u2212 H) \u2212 C \u03b1 \u2212 of a peptide chain. The peptide units are rigid and planar, narrowing down the possibilities of peptide conformations. The planarity and the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds between the carboxy and amino groups of peptide units lead to regular protein structures, as \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets. An example of an \u03b1-helical protein is the photoreceptor bacteriorhodopsin plotted in Fig. 9 .1. It has seven \u03b1-helices reaching from inside the cell through the cellular membrane to the other side. Many photoreceptor proteins exhibit a chromophore covalently bound to a specific amino acid called the binding site. This specific location inside the protein predominantly has a well-defined three-dimensional structure with optimized interactions between the chromophore and the protein surroundings. These surroundings can give rise to Coulomb interactions and interactions by hydrogen bonds, \u03c0-stacking, steric hindrance, etc. In bacteriorhodopsin these interactions result in an optimized trans to cis isomerization process of the retinal chromophore, with an increased quantum yield and an isomerization dynamics of 500 fs, which is at least 3 times faster than the isomerization reaction in solution [4] [5] [6] [7] . A mechanism for reaction optimization in bacteriorhodopsin is presented in Sect. 9.2.",

Even neutral molecules represent an overlay of positive and negative charge density patterns, and the full Coulomb interaction between molecules therefore involves an expansion into a series of dipolar, quadrupolar, etc. interaction terms. Typically, only the dipolar interaction terms are considered, which fall off with the third power of the intermolecular separation; see Sect. 9.2 for the explicit form of this interaction. Whether these dipolar interaction terms give rise to F\u00f6rster energy transfer or Frenkel exciton formation (in both intermolecular electron exchange is excluded), depends on the strength of these terms relative to that of other factors, such as IVR, intramolecular population decay (radiative or nonradiative), and optical (pure) dephasing (by coupling to the environment), which may disrupt the intermolecular coupling. If the dipolar coupling is large relative to these dynamic disturbances, electronic excited states of the ensemble of N molecules will be linear combinations of the N-molecule direct product states with one or more of the molecules singly excited. These linear combinations represent delocalized optical excitations known as Frenkel excitons, and form manifolds labeled the one-exciton manifold, two-exciton manifold, etc., depending on the number of singly excited molecules in the N-molecule basis states forming the exciton states. The combined oscillator strength of the N molecules is redistributed over the one-exciton states leading to enhanced radiative decay rates for some of these exciton states. Note that the delocalized exciton states are eigenstates of the N-molecule Hamiltonian, and therefore stationary solutions.",

A mechanism for reaction optimization by the protein environment is presented in Sect. 9.2.

            "text": "Energy transfer is also widely used in medical and analytical applications. In cancer treatment (photodynamic light therapy) energy is used to generate locally high concentrations of singlet oxygen, ultimately leading to cell death. The mechanism of releasing oxygen from molecules with endoperoxide groups is studied in Sect. 9.5. Photoreceptor proteins absorb light by chromophore molecules and convert the energy into biologically useful properties, e.g. proton gradient. The wide use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as biological label (see Sect. 9 .3), relies on using the extent of fluorescence quenching for conversion of fluorescence quantum yields into a ruler for determining distances on atomic scales. As mentioned above, various chemical and structural changes within the complete chain of a biological process can stretch over a wide range of timescales from femtoseconds to seconds. Many of these changes, which lead to biomolecular conformations or metastable structures are not accessible with optical spectroscopy, but could lead to characteristic changes in the vibrational spectra. The protein dynamics described by all possible conformations, time scales and couplings would contain a complete set of information to understand the function of proteins. However, an obstacle to calculate metastable conformations is the curse of dimensionality, as typical biomolecular systems contain hundreds or thousands of degrees of freedom. In Sect. 9.6 the Hidden Markov Model approach is applied to reduce the dimensionality of biological systems to a few essential degrees of freedom and to identify metastable conformational structures in time series. The recent developments in time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy make the prospect of combining experimental time-resolved vibrational data with molecular dynamical calculations of metastable conformation an exciting direction for future investigations. Section 9.7 deals with real-time identification of airborne bacteria using multiphoton excitation, multiphoton ionization and laser induced breakdown with femtosecond pulses to optimize the fluorescence emission of aerosol microparticles. The higher order interaction of the electric field with the bacteria reveals specific spectroscopic data not available in linear spectroscopy and is a key feature for identifying bacteria in urban aerosols. These techniques may prove very useful in future attempts to contain disease outbreaks by bacteria or viruses, such as SARS or anthrax, or straightforward monitoring of levels of typical highly antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospitals.",

The description of electric fields in proteins is still a timely issue to this day [11] , in part due to the difficulty of measuring them within proteins. A further degree of complexity is added, when it comes to measuring these electric fields in the ultrashort time domain, where fundamental phenomena occur, that govern the fate of photobiological functions.

The former play an essential role in a broad range of light-driven biological processes, such as vision, energy transduction and circadian control. All these functions involve both the conversion of light energy into charge separation and retinal isomerization, but the interplay of these processes is the subject of intense debate. The retinal protein of which the initial photochemistry is most extensively studied is the photosynthetic protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR). This protein acts as a light-driven proton pump by means of a multistep process, the so-called photocycle. In the traditional model, the light driven trans-cis isomerization of retinal ( Fig.  9. 3), is the key primary step in this cycle. However, it is also known that Franck-Condon excitation of all-trans retinal results in an immediate change of permanent isomerization dipole moment by more than 12 D [16, 17] , causing a sudden polarization of retinal. It has been suggested that the dielectric response of the protein, might be the primary light-induced event [18, 19] that could drive structural changes on longer time scales [20] . In addition, it is well established that the specific protein environment enhances the yield and the stereo-selectivity of the isomerization [21] , when compared to retinal in solvents.

Isomerization, i.e. a C13-C14 dihedral angle > 90 , thus occurs on a time scale longer than 200 fs. This conclusion is supported by transient absorption studies on wild type bR using 5 fs pulses [23] , suggesting that a skeletal change occurs in the first 200 fs, which corresponds to a large twisting about the C13-C14 bond, prior to isomerization. Similar conclusions were drawn from stimulated Raman studies showing a decay of the high frequency C=C, C-C and methyl rock modes in \u223c250 fs [24] . Femtosecond vibrational spectroscopy shows that isomerization occurs indeed later (\u2264500 fs) and is followed by a slower vibrational relaxation of the isomerized photoproduct (the so-called J to K transition) [7, [24] [25] [26] .",

[27] computed the distribution of charges in the S 1 excited state, as a function of the isomerization coordinate of model chro- mophores of rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin. The computed dipole moment of the S 1 state, increases along the isomerization coordinate of the chromophore, confirming an earlier suggestion by Salem and Bruckman [28] . It thus appears that while there is no isomerization in the first 200 fs or so, the system undergoes a large dipole moment change upon photoexcitation, followed by a translocation of charge. However, the time scale of the latter and its interplay with the initial twisting and subsequent isomerization are still unknown. Direct measurements of the charge separation process using photovoltaic techniques have been performed [29, 30] . However, the intrinsic temporal resolution of these techniques is limited to several picoseconds, i.e. slower than the \u2248500-fs isomerization process. To visualize the electronic response of bR on a short time scale, Groma et al. [31] recently reported a different approach, based on a nonlinear technique: interferometric detection of optical rectification. The second order susceptibility \u03c7 (2) of the retinal chromophore is unusually high, especially in its native protein environment, and this property has been shown to be a requirement for functioning of bR [32] . These strong nonlinear properties give rise to optical rectification [33] , among others, in non-centrosymmetric crystals. Groma et al. [31] used it in the case of oriented bR crystal films and measured an impulsive macroscopic polarization, which they associated with the charge separation.",

The absorption spectrum of bR ( Fig. 9 .4B) exhibits a band in the visible, due to retinal, and a band near 280 nm, predominantly due to the eight Trps present in the protein. The Trp absorption is due to transition from the ground state to the lowest two closelying excited states (labeled L a and L b ) of the indole moiety. The transition into the L a state implies a large difference dipole moment with respect to the ground state [36] , making the Trp's particularly well-suited molecular-level sensors of electric field changes within the protein, as the latter are expected to cause large changes in their spectral features.

To probe the electric field changes associated with the charge translocation in retinal, we have excited the latter at 560 nm, and interrogated the Trp absorption changes with 80-90 fs time resolution, using tuneable near-UV pulses, from a noncollinear optical parametric oscillator. The details of the setup are given in [37, 38] . Our approach has two advantages: (a) in contrast to experiments in the VIS or IR, that probe retinal directly [7, [23] [24] [25] , the charge displacements become detectable with high sensitivity through an electric dipole interaction in the UV, (b) the local electric field changes are followed in real-time from femtoseconds to picoseconds (ps) or more. Figure 9 .5A shows the transient absorption changes, detected between 265 nm and 280 nm. The traces are normalized, highlighting their similar shape over the whole range of probe wavelengths. The presence of a rise time is directly deduced from the temporal derivative of the bleach transient ( Fig. 9 .4B). Its full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 150 fs is significantly larger than the 80-90 fs pump-probe cross-correlation. [35] . Retinal (purple) is covalently bound to Lys216 through a Schiff base linkage. The four nearest Tryptophan (Trp) residues are shown. Insert: Relative orientations of the difference dipole moments for retinal (red arrow), of Trp 86 (full black arrow) and Trp182 (dashed black arrow). B) Absorption spectrum of bR in the purple membrane. The band with maximum at 568 nm is due to the S0-S1 transition of the protonated Schiff base form of retinal, while the near-UV band at 280 nm is dominated by the S0-La and S0-L b transitions of eight Trp's. The vertical arrow indicate the excitation wavelength and the horizontal one the range of probe wavelengths. Insert: Orientations of the transition (full arrows) and difference (dashed arrows) dipole moments of tryptophan for S0 -La (red) and S0 -L b (blue) [36] . Arrows point to the positive end of the difference dipole moment. (80-90 fs) were obtained by second harmonic generation of the output of a tunable noncollinear OPA [37, 38] . The transients are normalized in amplitude. The time axis of the left panel is linear, while the right panel has a logarithmic one. B) The early time portion of the bleach transient in fig. 9 .4A (black squares), and its temporal derivative (red circles) showing a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 150 fs. The latter is clearly larger than the experimental time resolution of 85 fs (black dots) determined by the pump-probe cross-correlation [38] .",

More specifically, we could show that the signal was due to Trp86, by repeating the experiment with a mutant that lacked Trp182, obtaining the same results as with the wild type ( Fig. 9.6 ). This makes sense since the linear polarization anisotropy of the signal is high (0.30\u00b10.05), meaning that the responding Trp transition dipole is almost parallel to the transition dipole moment of retinal along the conjugate chain, as is the case for the L a state of Trp86 (insert Fig.  9 .4A).",

In addition, the fast inertial relaxation of indole-like molecules is slower, even in liquids [40] . Rather, we attribute the bleach to the above-mentioned large dipole moment change of retinal. The rise time of the bleach signal ( Fig. 9 .5B) then reflects the instantaneous dipole moment change and an ensuing gradual charge translocation along retinal. However, the Trp response does not resemble a difference spectrum that was to be expected in the case of a pure Stark shift of the L a transition. As a matter of fact, the bleach component does not have a positive counterpart with comparable amplitude at nearby wavelengths. As shown in [37] , and briefly described below, the difference spectrum is rather dominated by the effects of excitonic coupling resulting from the resonance interaction of retinal and Trp at \u223c280 nm, meaning that oscillator strength borrowing can occur between retinal and the Trp chromophores.",

In the case of the three chromophores, the total dipolar interaction is taken as the sum of pairwise interactions. The first three terms in (1) will give rise to the Stark effect, while the last four give rise to the resonance interaction. Thus we can form the full interaction Hamiltonian H = H 0 + V of the three (27x27 matrix) or of two (9x9 matrix) interacting chromophores. H 0 is the Hamiltonian of each isolated chromophore and V represents the dipole-dipole interaction between the chromophores. Diagonalization of this Hamiltonian by standard methods gives a set of eigenvalues, from which new transition energies can be found, and eigenvectors, from which new transition dipole moments can be determined. As illustrated in Fig. 9 .7 (bottom panel), this gives rise to a single ground state (| 0, 0, S 0 ) and a single excited state (| 0, 0, S 1 >) close to 570 nm (17 540 cm \u22121 ).

The dipole moment change is due to the translocation of charge, for which we measure the time scale for the first time. Given that the events at t < 200 fs are also characterized by large amplitude torsional motion of the retinal skeleton, prior to isomerization [23, 24] , we conclude that the dipole moment increase is related to these structural changes, as also predicted by quantum chemistry calculations [27] . In an intuitive picture, the torsional motion breaks the conjugation at the C13-C14 bond and thus localizes the charges on the left and right of that bond, which leads to a dipole moment increase. A similar situation is encountered in donor-acceptor molecules like DMABN, where the build-up of a charge transfer state involves rotation of the dimethyl amine with respect to the phenol moiety [43, 44] . In the protein environment, the gradual dipole moment change of retinal in the excited state then acts as driving force for the torsional motion, because the electrostatic interactions are attractive [45, 46] .",

This is the time scale of formation of the 13-cis isomer [7] , pointing to a weaker dipolar interaction in the ground state 13-cis retinal than in excited all-trans retinal. Since the isomerization leads to an electronic ground state, with a mainly covalent character as in the all-trans adduct state [27] , the dipole moment change is small, and so is the remaining bleach signal. The additional 3.5 ps decay component, which is similar to the vibrational relaxation in the 13-cis photoproduct found in experiments probing retinal [24] [25] [26] , suggests a further decrease of the dipolar interaction. Vibrational relaxation leads to a weak displacement of the center of gravity of the charge, which may cause the decrease in dipole strength. Alternatively, energy dissipation may cause structural changes in the retinal binding pocket, which modify the field detected at the location of Trp86. Finally, the weak bleach component at longer times (\u03c4 \u221e ) points to long-lived changes in the structure of the pocket and/or the dielectric constant, which may relate to changes detected in the picosecond range in mid-IR experiments [7] .",

The higher excited-state dynamics of bacteriorhodopsin has been studied by singlewavelength PrPP [54] and the combined use of PDP and PrPP allowed the distinction of overlapping bands in the PP signals [50] . In the recent years, the MPTAS techniques have been further developed to include dispersed detection [48, 49] , which allows the simultaneous probing of complete spectra with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, that subsequently can be analyzed globally [55] [56] [57] . This development, which allowed to test explicit physical models for light-driven biological processes, moved ultrafast research on biological systems to a qualitatively new level. The utility of MPTAS spectroscopies lies in their ability to control reactions as they evolve, by manipulating the population of transient species with applied laser pulses. This is, to a certain extent, related to coherent control mechanisms where reactions are manipulated via complex processes such as vibrational wave packet motion, quantum interferences and electronic coherences [58] . A more appropriate term for describing MPTAS spectroscopies is incoherent control, because the control effects are achieved and the data is interpreted solely in terms of manipulated electronic state populations. This simplification, as will be shown in the following applications, allows for clear, concise and biologically relevant interpretations of the measured data.",

Because two excitation pulses are used along with dispersed detection, MPTAS measurements generate multidimensional data (two time delays and one wavelength dimension), which can be collected and presented in two different ways ( Fig.  9 .10) [48, 49] . In a kinetic trace measurement ( Fig. 9 .10B), the additional pulse is placed at the selected delay (called 'dump-delay' in the case of PDP measurement) after the pump pulse and remains fixed during the measurement. The dump-delay corresponds to a specific distribution of excited-state population and thus determines the effect that will be induced. The delay of the probe pulse is scanned as in PP measurements and records the effect of the dump pulse on the spectrum and dynamics of the PP signal. Alternatively, the dump-induced dynamics can be explored by measuring an action trace ( Fig.  9 .10C) [48, 49] , in which the delay of the additional pulse is scanned whilst the probe pulse is maintained at a selected delay. An action trace monitors how the PP spectrum at the chosen probe delay changes as a consequence of the interaction of the additional pulse with the system at variable instances. An additional advantage of an action trace is that it is not affected by time-zero artifacts (e.g. cross-phase modulation, stimulated Raman scattering, 2-photon absorption etc.) because the probed signal is at a much longer delay, allowing clear observation of the dump-induced dynamic changes at early times.",

For the preliminary parameterization description of the PP signals alone, a sequential scheme is used, where the components interconvert unidirectionally with increasing exponential lifetimes; it provides estimates of the characteristic timescales for spectral evolution and the corresponding evolution-associated difference spectra (EADS) [56, 57] . The EADS estimated from such a scheme do not necessarily reflect pure transient states occurring in the experiment but rather provide a phenomenological description of the observed spectral evolution. To estimate the species-associated difference spectra (SADS) that portray the real states of the system, the PDP data is subsequently analyzed simultaneously with the PP data by applying a specific physical model in a so-called 'target analysis' [56, 57] . In this description of the data, a connectivity scheme (physical model) is chosen with each of its compartments depicting a true physical state of the system. The model applied in a target analysis is designed to make physical sense, to produce plausible spectra and (of course) to represent the experimental data well.",

GFP absorbs primarily in the near-UV (the main absorption band attributed to a so-called state A of GFP peaks at around 400 nm), but fluoresces in the green (the fluorescence maximum lies near 510 nm). It is generally accepted that the large shift of the emission to longer wavelengths after near-UV absorption is caused by a deprotonation reaction of the neutral chromophore in the excited state [62] . Upon excitation of the state A band with near-UV light, the chromophore deprotonates on a picosecond timescale and subsequent proton transport occurs, most likely via a hydrogen-bonded network that involves an internal water molecule (W25) a serine residue (S205) and a terminal proton acceptor, an ionized glutamate (E222) [63] . The thus formed intermediate state, with a deprotonated, anionic chromophore and a protonated, neutral glutamate is generally referred to as I * and is the emitting state of GFP, responsible for the green fluorescence around 510 nm. An anionic ground state species, which has been labeled I, can be stabilized and photoconverted back to A at cryogenic temperatures [64] . It has been postulated that the molecular ground state of the chromophore in this anionic form acts as an intermediate in the GFP photocycle [62, [64] [65] [66] [67] . However, with time-resolved spectroscopy only the excited states A* and I * of GFP could be detected [68] , and the molecular nature and dynamics of any ground state intermediate remained elusive. MPTAS in combination with global analysis was successfully used as a tool to directly measure the ground-state proton transfer dynamics in GFP [69] . By manipulating the excited and ground state populations using an additional femtosecond laser pulse that dumped the excited state I *, the so far hidden anionic ground state of GFP was shown to be an integral part of the photocycle.",

The first spectrum (black line), taken at a delay of 400 fs, exhibits a ground-state bleaching near 400 nm, an ESA band at 440 nm and a broad SE band ranging from 450 to 550 nm. This stimulated emission can primarily be assigned to the excited state of the neutral chromophore, A*. At progressively increasing time delays, a pronounced SE band with maximum intensity around 509 nm and a shoulder at 545 nm develops. The intensity of the SE signal near 509 nm is a direct measure of the population of I *, and these results demonstrate the formation of I * on a picosecond timescale, which corresponds to the deprotonation reaction of the phenolic oxygen of the chromophore [62] . Concomitant with the rise of SE, the excited-state absorption around 440 nm increases, indicating that like A*, I * has a pronounced ESA in this spectral region. The transient absorption signal then slowly decays to zero amplitude on a nanosecond timescale (spectra not shown). These dynamics are also reflected in Fig. 9 .12A, where the kinetic trace probed at 509 nm is shown (blue squares). The trace shows little signal at early times after excitation. On a timescale of several picoseconds the SE signal rises to a maximum (negative) amplitude. The SE signal subsequently decays to zero in about 3 ns, which corresponds mainly to radiative decay of I * to the ground state [67, 70] .",

The red circles in Fig.  9 .12A show the kinetic trace at 509 nm in the presence of a short 540 nm dump pulse, which overlaps with a shoulder of GFP's fluorescence spectrum and is fired 20 ps after the 400 nm excitation flash. Up to 20 ps, the trace overlaps with an unmodified (i.e. without dump-pulse) transient absorption trace. At 20 ps, a sudden decrease of the SE signal indicates that the excited-state population has decreased as a result of the action of the dump pulse. Figure  9 .12B contains the corresponding kinetic traces measured at 496 nm, showing the appearance of a large induced absorption at 20 ps. This indicates that as a result of the action of the dump pulse, a product species that absorbs at 496 nm is formed concomitantly with the depletion of the excited state. This species corresponds to the ground state of the deprotonated chromophore, I, and therefore this experiment clearly demonstrates, for the first time, a ground state intermediate in the photocycle of GFP. Figure 9 .12C shows the kinetic trace at 492 nm, where I * shows an isosbestic point. At this wavelength, the signals exclusively represent the dynamic behavior of the ground state species I (red squares). We observe that after its formation by the dump pulse, the I state disappears rapidly; the smooth curve represents a fit of the data with a single exponential decay of 400 ps. Without the dump pulse the I state remains invisible because it decays about ten times faster than it is formed.",

As can be seen from the difference spectrum taken at a delay of 22 ps (i.e., 2 ps after the dump pulse, Figure 9 .12A), the stimulated emission band of I * from 509 to 600 nm has been significantly depleted. Moreover, a pronounced new absorption band is observed near 500 nm in the PDP spectrum, along with a 15 nm red-shift of the isosbestic point (at 492 nm in the PP spectrum), indicating the formation of the ground state species upon dumping. Thus, the dumped spectrum is a superposition of the excited state species I * and the newly formed ground state species I. To assess the spectral properties of the ground state species I, the difference spectrum of I * was scaled by a factor of 0.57 (to reflect that an estimated fraction of population 0.43 was dumped to the ground state) and subtracted from the dumped spectrum. The resulting double-difference spectrum (dotted line) corresponds to the 'pure' signal of I. At subsequent delays of the probe pulse (450 ps and 900 ps, Fig. 9 .13 B and C), the absorption feature near 500 nm decreases significantly and the 'dumped' spectrum starts to resemble the undumped spectrum, indicating that the newly formed ground state species indeed has a significantly shorter lifetime than I *. MPTAS data measured in both water and D 2 O buffer solutions were globally analyzed. The analysis revealed a pronounced effect of deuteration on the observed dynamics, but virtually no influence on the spectra, as was expected for a proton (or deuterium) transfer reaction [69] . The model used to interpret and quantify the data is shown in Fig. 9 .14 (upper panel) along with the tran- Fig. 9 .13. Time-resolved absorbance difference spectra recorded for GFP at the delays indicated after the excitation at 400 nm in the absence (solid line) and presence (dashed line) of a 'dump' pulse at 540 nm, applied 20 ps after the excitation. The dotted lines denote a double-difference spectrum, in which a fraction of 0.57 of the undumped spectrum is subtracted from the dumped spectrum, and denote the 'pure' difference spectra corresponding to the anionic ground state I. sient spectra of the GFP photocycle intermediates ( Fig. 9 .14, lower panel). Both proton transfer events in the excited and the ground state proceed in a double-exponential fashion, with the resulting species-associated difference spectra virtually identical for H 2 O and D 2 O solutions. The substantial difference is in the kinetics: the excited-and ground-state proton transfer is 2 and 12 times slower, respectively, when the proton is substituted to deuterium. The estimated proton transfer time in the ground state is 440 ps. The importance of this observation is in the fact that the proton back transfer in GFP occurs in the molecular ground state, as do the vast majority of proton transfers in biology. Thus using MPTAS the 'true', intrinsic rate constant of [19, 20] ) of A*, I *, I 1, and I 2 species relative to the A state that result from a target analysis of the time-resolved spectra recorded for GFP in H2O (solid lines) and D2O (dotted lines).",

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms behind these functions are not fully understood and in fact a concise description of their properties is lacking. Carotenoids typically have a \u03c0-conjugation length between 7 and 13 ( Fig. 9 .15) and their spectroscopic properties are interpreted on the basis of what is known for linear polyenes. Traditionally, their electronic structure has been described as a manifold with two low-lying electronic states: S 2 and S 1 (the 1B + u and 2A \u2212 g polyene states) [71] . The S 1 state has the same electronic symmetry as the ground electronic state S 0 (1A \u2212 g ) and therefore is dark, i.e. it is not observed in the linear ground-state absorption spectrum. The strong absorption of blue-green light corresponds to the transition from S 0 to S 2 . The S 2 state is easily observed in fluorescence-upconversion and pump-probe (PP) measurements as it emits in the visible region and absorbs in the nearinfrared. S 2 decays by ultrafast (\u223c200 fs) internal conversion (IC) to the S 1 state, which internally converts to the ground state, with a lifetime that depends on the conjugation length (\u223c1 to \u223c100 ps). The S 1 state is easily observed and characterized in PP experiments because of its distinctly strong ESA in the visible [71] .",

If the entire ESA band from 500 nm to 600 nm were due to S 1 state, the shapes of \u2206\u2206OD and PP spectra should be identical.

The fact that S \u2021 is depleted after dumping S 2 shows it corresponds to an excited state which is formed via S 2 , and which, as both 800 nm and 530 nm repump experiments illustrate, is separate from S 1 . and spectra (bottom) measured for \u03b2-carotene with a 400 nm pump and 530 nm dump/repump pulse.

The nature and relationship of these states remains elusive. Calculations on polyenes [77] predict two electronic states, apart from S 1 , under S 2 , the 1B \u2212 u and the 3A \u2212 g states. However, in order to assign the observed S \u2021 (or the S * ) to either of them, determination of their 0-0 energy is required. It is also unclear to what degree the spatial configuration of carotenoids influences their excited-state manifold; it has been proposed that the relaxation in the excited state manifold of \u03b2-carotene includes minor structural changes [72] and that in light-harvesting complexes, the protein-imposed configuration controls an additional deactivation channel [78] . Thus, it was concluded that these new states result from overcoming configurational barriers in the S 2 state when excited with additional excitation energy [49] .",

Figure 9 .19A shows the normalized PP spectra measured 1 ps and 10 ps after excitation. The region below 550 nm, which has been associated with the ESA of the S 1 state [79, 80] , is enhanced in the 10-ps spectrum. This implies that S 1 is populated on the timescale of a few picoseconds after the ICT state. Figure 9 .19B contains the \u2206\u2206OD traces measured in the PDP experiment with the dump pulse placed 3 ps after the pump pulse. Before the interaction of the dump pulse with the sample (probe delay less than 3 ps), the signal is zero -the dump pulse has not arrived yet and therefore the PP and PDP data are identical. The induced change appears upon the arrival of dump pulse and has a temporal profile that depends on the probe wavelength: the peak of the ICT ESA at 590 nm is lost instantaneously, whereas the loss at 535 nm (S 1 ESA) and 435 nm (GSB) shows slower, and more complex, dynamics. Figure 9 .19C contrasts the \u2206\u2206OD spectra to the PP spectra at two probe delays after the 3-ps dump. At a probe delay of 3.5 ps, the \u2206\u2206OD spectrum does not have any amplitude in the S 1 region and indicates that the dump pulse selectively depletes the ESA of the ICT-state; in contrast, the loss found at a probe delay of 14 ps is uniform across the complete ESA as the \u2206\u2206OD spectrum overlaps with the PP spectrum. This leads to a conclusion that the S 1 state is separated from the ICT state: the dump does not affect it in the same instantaneous fashion. However, the fact, that after a certain time delay S 1 does exhibit a response, indicates that the S 1 and the ICT state are in equilibrium with each other.

This relaxation involves an unrelaxed, 'hot' intermediate similar to other carotenoids [71, 72] . Both the natural and the dumped evolution of the ICT state populates an unequilibrated ground state, which in turn decays into the equilibrium ground state. The single trace that shows this most clearly is the 435 nm trace in Fig. 9 .19B (blue): upon dumping, the bleach does not recover instantaneously, but ground state equilibration dynamics takes place.

PYP contains an intrinsic chromophore, paracoumaric acid, that is covalently bound to the protein backbone via a cysteine residue [86] [87] [88] [89] . Upon photoexcitation, this chromophore undergoes a transcis isomerization around its double bond [89] [90] [91] and initiates a complicated series of reversible reactions that extends over 15 decades in time extending from femtoseconds to seconds [92] [93] [94] [95] . These isomerization-induced processes include chromophore protonation [92, 96] , protein unfolding [93] , hydrogenbond disruption [97, 98] , and their corresponding recovery reactions. Hence, PYP is an excellent system for studying the complex relationship between protein dynamics and chemical reaction dynamics and more specifically how Nature has tuned both to produce biological function. The properties and the photocycle of PYP have been extensively studied (see [99] [100] [101] for review), here we will mostly concentrate on the application of MPTAS to investigate the primary events occurring in PYP after the excitation.",

            "text": "Ultrafast PP transient spectra of wt-PYP, excited with ultrafast 395-nm excitation pulses, are shown in Fig. 9 .21, spanning probing times from 180 fs to 4 ns [48] . The collected spectra and dynamics of the PYP system are similar to the data measured in other dispersed PP measurements on PYP [94, [102] [103] [104] . All transient spectra show GSB, peaking at the maximum of the absorption spectrum (446 nm). The 180 fs and 2 ps spectrum also exhibit a broad negative band at 500 nm and a pronounced positive band at 370 nm, which are ascribed to the SE and the ESA band, respectively. In contrast, the 35 ps, 500 ps and 4 ns spectra no longer exhibit clear SE bands, but instead show positive product state absorption bands peaking at 500 nm and 480 nm, respectively, which are ascribed to the product state absorptions of the initial red-shifted intermediates in the PYP photocycle: I 0 and pR [99, 100] . The 35 ps, 500 ps and 4 ns PP spectra also exhibit a noticeable positive sharply peaked band at 360 nm that has not been previously ascribed to either the I 0 or the pR product state band. Since the ultrafast fluorescence signals on PYP show that no appreciable excited state population remains at this time [105] [106] [107] , this sharply featured band is not ascribed to the similar UV ESA band observed in the 180 fs and 2 ps spectra. Furthermore, a weak broad absorption is observed in the 4 ns spectrum, which extends beyond 550 nm. Excitation power-dependence of these bands along with the MPTAS (PDP) measurements allowed to attribute these bands to a photoionization of the PYP chromophore, resulting in hydrated electron responsible for the broad induced absorption band at wavelengths longer than 550 nm, and the radical of the chromophore, featuring the sharp induced absorption band around 360 nm [48] .",

            "text": "From the spectra shown in Fig. 9 .21, it is obvious that the pump-probe spectrum is composed out of largely overlapping bands (both spectrally and temporally) due to different initial intermediates in the PYP photocycle. Getting a picture of how precisely the initial steps of PYP photocycle are organized is impossible using pump-probe and fluorescence upconversion data alone. For example, the near complete overlap of the SE band with the absorption of the first photoproduct, I 0 , precludes directly correlating the quenching timescales of the excited state with the timescale of photocycle initiation [94, 104, 108] . Because of this ambiguity, different kinetic schemes have been proposed for modeling the initial dynamics of the PYP photocycle [102, 104] . MPTAS was applied to get a better understanding of the initial dynamics of PYP [48] . Representative kinetic traces from two PDP data sets dumped at 500 fs (green circles) and 2 ps (solid blue circles) are shown in Fig. 9 .22, overlapping the PP signals (red triangles). The dump pulse shifts part of the population from the excited state to the ground state, which is observed as a loss of SE (550 nm) and ESA (375 nm) with a concomitant recovery in the bleach region combined ESA and radical band (black squares) and hydrated electron band (blue circles). As expected for photoionization, which is a near-instantaneous process, the radical and electron bands in 500 ps pump-probe spectrum remain completely unaffected by the dump pulse, regardless of its timing. The action traces measured in the spectral regions of GSB and I 0 induced absorption allow to monitor the efficiency of entering PYP photocycle as a function of time [48] . By comparing them to excited state population (solid lines in Fig. 9 .23), which can be estimated from the intensity of SE or ESA, one can see, that in the early times, the probability of producing an I 0 intermediate is surprisingly much higher. On the basis of these PDP data and the PP data two self-consistent kinetic models were constructed to describe the observed dynamics ( Fig. 9.24 ) [48] . Both the homogeneous (Fig. 9 .24B) and the inhomogeneous (Fig. 9 .24A) models describe the observed PDP and PP dynamics as an evolution between discrete interconnected transient states that are separated into four categories: i) excited-state dynamics, ii) ground-state dynamics, iii) photocycle dynamics and iv) an ionization channel. Whilst both models produce similar quality fits to the measured PDP data, their respective interpretations differ. Fig. 9 .24. Connectivity schemes compatible with the data and used in the global analysis for the PDP: A) inhomogeneous model and B) homogeneous model. Dynamical states are separated into four classes: excited state (red), ground state (blue), photocycle products (green) and two-photon ionization dynamics (black). ESI1, ESI2, and ESI3 refer to the excited state lifetimes \u03c41, \u03c42 and \u03c43 respectively. pG is the equilibrated ground state species, and GSI is the ground state intermediate. Thick solid arrows represent the initial excitation process from the laser pulse and thin solid arrows dynamics represent the natural PP population dynamics. The dashed arrows represent the population transfer dynamics that may be enhanced with the dump pulse. Sn is a higher lying electronic state and pCA \u2022 is p-coumaric acid PYP chromophore radical after ionization. models differ primarily in the connectivity scheme for the excited-state evolution, and with respect to which state(s) is (are) initially excited by the applied laser pulse (thick black lines). Whilst the inhomogeneous model ascribes the multiexponential excited-state behavior to a superposition of multiple subpopulations with differing decay times, the homogeneous model ascribes the multiexponential decay to evolution along the excited-state potential energy surface.",

The PDP data favor the inhomogeneous over the homogeneous model since each ESI does not have the same yield in initiating the PYP photocycle. This observation, in combination with the global analysis of the kinetic trace PDP signals, supports the observation that ESI1 has the highest yield (\u223c40%) followed by ESI2 (20%), whereas ESI3 has a near negligible yield (\u223c1%) in initiating the photocycle. A homogenous model would require that the excited state population would have a time-dependent yield and evolve across a complex potential energy surface with quenching pathway(s) that compete with photocycle generation. The inhomogeneous model, in contrast, is simpler to interpret.",

Besides the problems related to the nature of the samples (biological material is 'soft', difficult to obtain in large quantities, and often unstable under laser light illumination), the dynamic properties of biological molecules are inherently complex. Photoactive proteins and pigments use the light in a variety of ways, their principle reaction pathways occur in parallel with the cul-de-sac events and the spectral features of different photoreaction intermediates co-exist in time and spectrally overlap with reaction 'byproducts'. These properties often prevent unambiguous interpretations of ultrafast spectroscopic data obtained in 'traditional' ways, such as pump-probe and fluorescence up-conversion. Multi-pulse transient absorption spectroscopies, together with the state-of-the-art achievements in laser technology, open up the possibilities of bringing the understanding the lightinduced biological reactions to a qualitatively new level.",

The higher excited state has to be considered as a representative of the multitude of higher excited electronvibrational states (it has to be introduced to allow for intra-chromophore excitations in the same energetic range where the energy of two singly excited states at different chromophores is positioned). Besides their energy level structure every chromophore has to be characterized by transition dipole moments.

Otherwise one applies the dipole-dipole approximation (necessary in any case if the higher excited states are concerned).

Fig 9. 26), but in the absence of two-exciton states and disorder. Most efficient localization is achieved for a control pulse length of around 600 fs. As has to be expected an increase in temperature acts counterproductive. The effect of transitions among the single and two-exciton manifold is demonstrated in Fig. 9 .28. It results in a reduction of P tar (\u03c4 f ) from a value above 0.6 to a value somewhat below 0.4. To correctly rate this value one has to notice that the probability to stay in the chromophore complex ground-state is larger than 0.4. Therefore, it is advisable to consider the renormalized target state population P tar (\u03c4 f )/P 0 (\u03c4 f ) which amounts to a value of about 0.6 (P 0 (\u03c4 f ) is the ground-state population). This justifies in part to neglect the two-exciton states when considering the influence of disorder (note also that an iteration of the OCT equations combined with an ensemble averaging now refers to less than 60 density matrix Fig. 9 .25) at t f . The population is drawn versus the pulse duration t f \u2212t0 as well as in the absence of dissipation and for different temperatures. All data have been obtained in neglecting two-exciton states as well as disorder and after up to 50 iterations of the coupled density matrix equations for forward and backward propagation. equations compared to about 1000 for the inclusion of two-exciton states). In any case the presence of disorder further decreases the control yield as shown in Fig. 9.29 (upper panel) . Fortunately, this inefficiency can be compensated when changing to laser pulse control including polarization shaping. The possibility of an independent control of both polarizations of the field increases the control yield considerably (cf. the lower panel of Fig. 9.29 ). As demonstrated also in Fig. 9 .29 the time interval where the two components (x-and y-component) of the field are non-zero becomes longer compared to the control with a linearly polarized field (the different sub pulses of the two components act out of phase indicating strong elliptic polarization of the control field).",

Traditionally, malaria has been treated with quinolines. Unfortunately, most of the parasites responsible for the vast majority of fatal malaria infections, have become resistant to quinolines. Today, the most potent antimalarials available are artemisinins, extracted from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua), rapidly killing all asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum by specifically inhibiting its sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase ortholog [140] . The special feature of Artemisinin is an endoperoxide group which can be cleaved or dissociated by interaction with iron ions or light [141] .

In traditional PDT, a photosensitive drug is excited by light in the presence of ground state molecular oxygen, which is abundant in tissues/cells, to produce singlet molecular oxygen, 1 O 2 , as well as other cytotoxic agents. These, and 1 O 2 cause severe physiological damage in selected cell subunits, such as cell membranes, and lead subsequently to cell death [142] . In the first step of PDT the dye is administered to the patient, where it accumulates in the tumor tissues [143] . Next, the target area is irradiated directly by a light source of a wavelength where the photosensitizer absorbs. Upon light absorption, (see Fig. 9 .30), the photosensitizer is excited to the first excited singlet state S 1 , from where it can again return to the ground state S 0 or alternatively reach the first excited triplet state T 1 through intersystem crossing (ISC). Once the first triplet excited state is formed, two different types of interaction mechanisms might occur between the photosensitizer and the target substrate [144] . Photodynamic reactions of type I are those where the photodynamic damage is mainly caused by radical photosensitizer intermediates. Reactions of type II, on the other hand, involve energy transfer (ET) from the triplet state of the photosensitizer to ground state triplet oxygen 3 O 2 , resulting in 1 O 2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The use of PDT in biological tissues is limited to a few millimeters depth, due to strong scattering and photon loss I = I 0 exp (\u2212\u03c3 t x). Here, I 0 and I are the light intensities in front of and inside the biological tissue, \u03c3 t is the total damping cross section, which is a sum of the scattering cross section \u03c3 s and the absorption cross section \u03c3 a , and x is the depth in the sample. Typically, the scattering coefficient \u03c3 s decreases from 120 mm \u22121 at 400 nm to 20 mm \u22121 at 1800 nm, whereas the absorption coefficient varies between 40 mm \u22121 and 0.01 mm \u22121 in the same spectral region. Thus, the transmitted light intensity in 1 mm depth of biological tissue is only 0.027 % at 600 nm and 4.07 % at 1600 nm. Since the intensity of the transmitted light increases for longer wavelengths, an ideal photosensitizer should preferably absorb at long wavelengths. However, the generation of singlet oxygen from abundant ground state oxygen requires an energy of more than 1270 nm, restricting the absorption of photosensitizers to wavelengths shorter than 1270 nm. As a consequence, for single photon excitation the phototherapeutic window ranges from 600 nm to 1200 nm. An alternative approach in PDT is the use of two-photon excitation processes with shaped laser pulses of longer wavelengths, and concomitantly higher light transmission in biological tissues. This could accomplish better excitation and higher selectivity in the presence of molecules with similar one-photon absorption, e.g. the melanin pigment [145] .",

Through orbital and state correlation diagrams obtained from thermochemical/spectroscopical data and symmetry/spin selection rules, Kearns and Khan [146] postulated that the excitation of small size endoperoxides to their first excited singlet or triplet states leads to the cleavage of the O-O endoperoxide bond, and therefore to the formation of oxygen biradicals, (see Fig. 9 .31a), while the excitation to higher-lying excited states, which imply promotion of an electron from a \u03c0 * OO orbital to a \u03c3 * CO orbital, induces the endoperoxide photodissociation into the parent hydrocarbon and singlet oxygen, (see Fig. 9 .31b). This can be easily rationalized taking into account that the population of antibonding \u03c3 * OO and \u03c3 * CO orbitals leads to a weakening of the O-O and C-O bonds, respectively, and therefore favors the cleavage of these respective bonds.",

In APO, the orientations of the elec-tronic TDMs are the same for S 0 \u2192 S 1 and S 0 \u2192 S 2 transitions: parallel to the x-axis (orange arrow in Fig. 9.32) . However, the S 0 \u2192 S 4 transition is perpendicular to these, and parallel to the y-axis (blue arrow in Fig. 9.32) . The investigated C-H bending vibration \u03b4(CH) of APO (black arrow in Fig. 9 .32) around 1170 cm \u22121 has a vibrational dipole moment oriented parallel to the y-axis. Excitation at 273 nm results in a bleaching of the \u03b4(CH) absorption band. The bleaching signal of the vibrational \u03b4(CH) transition at 1170 cm \u22121 is plotted in Fig. 9 .33 for different relative polarization directions of the pump and the probe beam. The bleaching for probing with perpendicular polarized light is weaker than for probing with parallel polarized light indicating a relative angle of less than 54.7. Analysis of the bleaching signal gives an angle of 28 \u00b1 20, indicating an orientation of the electronic TDM excited at 273 nm more parallel to the y-axis than to the x-axis. Thus, the absorption band at 273 nm can be assigned to the S 0 \u2192 S 4 transition, and not to the S 0 \u2192 S 1 or S 0 \u2192 S 2 transitions. These findings support the above assignment of the absorption bands and the calculated character of the transitions. To summarize: on the basis of the new data we assign the absorption band at 271 nm to the S 0 \u2192 S 4 transition, the band at 279 nm to the S 0 \u2192 S 2 transition and the band around 300 nm, which exhibits a very low oscillator strength, both in the experiment as well as in the calculations, to the S 0 \u2192 S 1 transition.",

From there, it starts to increase again, showing thereby a binding character. As already stated before, electron excitation into \u03c3 * OO orbitals would significantly weaken the O-O endoperoxide bridge favoring its homolytic rupture. This way, APO molecules excited into the S 1 state would be \"trapped\" in this potential. Preliminary wave packet simulations in this one-dimensional model indicate vibrational oscillations of ca. 80 fs (full period); at longer time scales, the vibrational energy is expected to be dissipated into other normal modes, leading to relaxed oxygen diradical molecules that would finally evolve to lower energy rearrangement products. This is consistent with the photolysis results published in the works of Brauer [147] and Eisenthal, [148] who obtain rearrangement products and the parent aromatic hydrocarbon, upon irradiation of APO or 1,4-dimethyl-9,10-diphenyl-9,10-anthracene-endoperoxide at \u03bb \u2265 270nm.",

The population of \u03c3 * CO orbitals through the conical intersection is consistent with the weakening of the CO bond and the subsequent oxygen loss. However, this process is highly unlikely to occur as the curve crossing is located significantly above the experimental irradiation energy [147] .

Figure 9 .35b displays schematically the diabatic potential energy curves for the ground electronic state and the lowest energy states of B 1 symmetry of APO. Similar to the concerted cycloreversion mechanism, several singlet/singlet crossings also can be observed for the nonconcerted mechanism. Starting from the \u03c0 CC \u2192 \u03c0 * Fig. 9 .35. Diabatic potential energy curves for the ground and the lowest energy B1 singlet excited states of APO along the RCO dissociation coordinate, assuming a concerted (a) and a step-wise mechanism (b) for 1 O2. The red arrow represents the experimental irradiation energy that results in the observation of cycloreversion products [147] . S 2 excited state, which is the only accessible state for irradiation at \u03bb \u2265 279nm, the system would be able to overcome the S 2 /S 1 and S 2 /S 3 crossings through vibronic couplings, finally reaching the \u03c0 * OO \u2192 \u03c0 * CC S 3 excited state, which in turn presents a crossing around a R CO distance of 1.70\u00c5 with the \u03c0 * OO \u2192 \u03c3 * CO dissociative state, directly associated with singlet oxygen loss. The main difference to the concerted mechanism is that in this case all the calculated singlet/singlet crossings, including the \u03c0 * OO \u2192 \u03c0 * CC / \u03c0 * OO \u2192 \u03c3 * CO curve crossing lie below the energy stored by the system upon irradiation; therefore, through nonadiabatic dynamics fragmentation can occur. Once more, these results are consistent with the experimental cycloreversion quantum yields ranging from 0.25-0.35, reported in Brauer's [147] and Eisenthal's [148] work when they irradiated at the wavelength region assigned to the S 2 band. As seen in Fig. 9 .35, a second crossing for a R CO distance of 2.35\u00c5, is also found between the dissociative \u03c0 * OO \u2192 \u03c3 * CO and APO's ground.

Efficient algorithmic identification of the metastable conformations is a challenging problem, which has recently been tackled by set-oriented approaches [158] [159] [160] . In the context of the present work Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are used to extract the effective dynamics between hidden metastable molecule conformations from observable time series. e.g. the torsional angles of the backbone of biopolymers obtained by MD simulations [161] . In addition, the flexibility within conformations can be modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDE), thus comprising the HmmSde model [162] [163] [164] . As the description of internal flexibility by SDEs also accounts for relaxation from one metastable conformation to another, this approach narrows the gap between \"flipping dynamics\" and transition path computation, as described in, e.g., [165] .",

First: Discretizing the state space is a nontrivial task, as typical biomolecular systems contain hundreds or thousands of degrees of freedom. Fortunately, chemical observations reveal that-even for larger biomolecules-the curse of dimensionality can be circumvented by exploiting the hierarchical structure of the dynamical and statistical properties of biomolecular systems: only relatively few essential degrees of freedom may be needed to describe the conformational transitions. Second: After discretizing the state space there is a choice in the lag time \u03c4 used to obtain the transition matrix. If \u03c4 * is the time step between subsequent data points then the lag time \u03c4 can be set to r\u03c4 * by evaluating transitions from every kth sampled step to every (k + r)th, r \u2265 1, sampled step. Taking r > 1 corresponds to a coarser discretization of the time domain of the originally continuous dynamics. Different values of r give rise to different transition matrices. Therefore, subsets of the state space are metastable with respect to a certain timescale. By choosing r sufficiently large one can decrease correlations between subsequent time steps and therefore ensure that the Markov description is a proper description.",

As the Markov property does not hold for projections of Markov processes in general, we have to be aware that the process on the (torsion angles) subspace might no longer be Markovian. Nevertheless, we assume that there is an unknown metastable decomposition into m sets D 1 , . . . , D m , in the full dimensional system. We then can premise that, at any time t, the system is in one of the metastable states D jt to which we simply refer by j t in the following. However, the time series (j t ) is hidden, i.e., neither known in advance nor observed, while the series (Y t ) is called the output series or the observed sequence. This scenario can be represented by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). A HMM abstractly consists of two related stochastic processes: a hidden process j t , that fulfills the Markov property, and an observed process Y t , that depends on the state of the hidden process j t at time t. A HMM is fully specified by the initial distribution \u03c0, the transition matrix P of the hidden Markov process j t , a rate matrix in continuous time, and the probability distributions that govern the observable Y t depending on the respective hidden state j t .",

In other words one expects the process to sample the restricted invariant density before exiting from a metastable state, and the sampling time of the time series is long enough to assume statistical independence between steps. Nevertheless, if this is not the case, only a slight modification of the model structure is required to include the relaxation behavior: Instead of i.i.d. random variables, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process serves as a model for the output behavior in each hidden state. The HMM then takes the form [162] : (9.13) where j t are the realizations of the hidden Markov process with discrete state space, W t is standard \"white noise\", and \u03c3 (j) the state dependent diffusion matrix.

As these regions are separated by a barrier of approx. 9 kJ/mol one would expect a metastable behavior at a reasonable timescale. To confirm this assumption, we use HmmSde to extract a Viterbi path, assuming 4 (hidden) states, for each of the Ramachan- dran angles \u03a6, \u03a8 . Superposition of these two Viterbi paths yields a Viterbi path with 11 states. As the number of hidden states is only determined by our initial guess, we use the transfer operator approach to further reduce the number of states. Setting up the stochastic transition matrix P with time lag \u03c4 = 0.1ps, and computing the first five eigenvalues: indicates 3 metastable sets. Using the information coded in the three dominant eigenvectors we aggregate the 11 states to 3 states. In Fig. 9 .38E the assignment of the data points to these metastable (hidden) states is shown, the plot reveals, that we identified the (symmetric) C7 conformations and the C5 conformation. Transition probabilities between these hidden states can be obtained by using (9.11), Fig. 9 .38D. Thus we have obtained a detailed dynamical picture of the effective finite temperature dynamics of GLDA in vacuum.",

Using a cutoff for electrostatic interactions of 1.1 nm and a Berendsen-temperature coupling to the solvent of 300K, we performed an MD-simulation over 2.5 ns with an integration timestep of 2 fs using again the Gromos 53a6 force field and recording the atom positions every 20 fs. After discretizing the Ramachandran plane in 5 \u2022 \u00d7 5 \u2022 boxes, the free energy for each box B i can be calculated by [183, 184] This free energy surface, see Fig. 9 .39, has, due to intermolecular interactions (water-GLDA), a considerably richer structure than the potential energy surface in gas phase, Fig. 9 .37. Analyzing the torsion angle time series with the HmmSde approach, assuming 24 metastable sets, perfectly distinguishes regions belonging to different local minima in the free energy surface, Fig. 9 .39. As these local minima are separated by low energy barriers, compared with thermally available energies, it is not a priori clear that they correspond to metastable states on timescales of e.g. 1 ps. An instructive picture is obtained by setting up the transition matrix, based on the 24 states of the obtained Viterbi path, and plotting the eigenvalues against the time lag used, Fig. 9 .40. It can be clearly seen that 4 metastable states are persistent even for larger time lags, as there is an obvious gap after the first 4 eigenvalues. The cause of the metastable states can be revealed by taking the intermolecular interactions into account. These interactions are mainly due to H-bond bridges between the peptide groups (-CO-NH-) and neighboring water molecules. Each peptide group provides a donor pair (NH) and an acceptor (O) for H-bond bridges attracting solvent molecules. If we restrict to microsolvation structures, i.e. GLDA with 1 or 2 waters, it is clear that ring like structures, as shown in Fig. 9 .41, are energetically favorable, as each water molecule can participate in two H-bond bridges [185] . Besides the possible extension of the C7 and C5 structure to C7+2 (atoms), C7+2+2, C5+2 and C5+2+2 structures, H-bond bridges can stabilize structures that do not occur in vacuum, namely the C6 structures shown, where the -O O-and -H H-repulsion is overcome by inserting water molecules to form a ring structure. In the following we denote by C7+X the C7+2+2 and C7+2 structures collectively (with analogous meaning of C6+X and C5+X).",

Although the system investigated here is of moderate size, HmmSde appears to be a promising approach to beat the curse of dimensionality in more complex systems. Currently conformational analysis of DNA fragments containing 15 base pairs has been pursued in our laboratory [173] . Hence, it is believed that this approach is much more general and can be used beyond the context of MD-simulations. Possible applications range, e.g., from transient spectroscopy to the analysis of climate or financial data. ",

            "text": "Several groups have developed sophisticated optical systems to distinguish bioaerosols from nonbioaerosols based on fluorescence [196] [197] [198] [199] and/or elastic scattering [200, 201] . The most advanced experiments address each individual aerosol particle, which is spectrally analyzed [196, 202, 203] . These instruments can run continuously, in-situ, and in real-time to provide rapid warning/alarm for the existence of a few potentially life threatening bio-aerosols in the midst of a vast number of nonbio-aerosols. The major flaw inherent in these instruments is frequent false alarms because the UV-Visible fluorescence systems are incapable of distinguishing different molecules with similar fluorescence peaks (such as tryptophan and diesel particles or cigarette smoke) [202, 204] . Fig 9. 43 shows, as an example, the similitude in the fluorescence spectra of diesel fuel, tryptophan and Bacillus subtilis, which is a biosimulant for Bacillus anthracis. It is even more elusive using LIF to expect identifying different kinds of harmless from pathogen microorganisms. In this latter case, extensive studies based on principle components analysis of the excitation vs fluorescence spectral matrix have been performed to distinguish the spectrum from one type of bacteria from another, without success [205] . However, an attractive capability of optical techniques is remote sensing, and especially Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging). The Lidar technique [206] allows mapping aerosols in 3D over several kilometers, similar to an optical Radar. It might be able to detect the release and spread of potentially harmful plumes (such as bioterrorism release or legionella from industrial cooling towers) at large distance and then provide time to take the necessary measures to protect populations or identify sources. So far, Lidar detection of bioaerosols has been demonstrated either using elastic scattering [206] or LIF [206, 207] . However, the distinction between bioaerosols and nonbio-aerosols was either impossible (elastic scattering only) or very unsatisfactory for LIF-Lidars (for the same reason as point monitors, e.g. interference with pollens and organic particles like traffic related soot or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)).",

            "text": "The most prominent feature of nonlinear processes in aerosol particles is strong localization of the emitting molecules within the particle, and subsequent backward enhancement of the emitted light [211, 212] . This unexpected behavior is extremely attractive for remote detection schemes, such as Lidar applications. Localization is achieved by the nonlinear processes, which typically involve the n-th power of the internal intensity I n (r) (r for position inside the particle). The backward enhancement can be explained by the reciprocity (or time reversal) principle: Re-emission from regions with high I n (r) tends to return toward the illuminating source by essentially retracing the direction of the incident beam that gave rise to the focal points. This backward enhancement has been observed for both spherical and non spherical [213] microparticles. More precisely, we investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, incoherent multiphoton processes involving n = 1 to 5 photons [212] . For n = 1, 2, 3, MPEF occurs in bioaerosols because of natural fluorophors such as amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosin), NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and flavins. Figure 9 .44 shows the LIF spectra of various bacteria, and the contribution of each fluorophor in the fluorescence spectrum under 266 nm excitation. The strongly anisotropic MPEF emission was demonstrated on individual microdroplets containing tryptophan, riboflavin, or other synthetic fluorophors [211] [212] [213] . The experiment was performed such that each individual microparticle was hit by a single laser shot. The aerosol source was based on a piezo driven nozzle, which precisely controlled the time of ejection of the microparticles. Figure 9 .45 shows the MPEF angular distribution and the comparison between experimental and theoretical (Lorentz-Mie calculations) results for the one-(400 nm) ( Fig. 9 .45a), two-(800 nm) ( Fig. 9 .45b) and three-photon (1, 2\u00b5m) ( Fig. 9 .45c) excitation process. They show that the fluorescence emission is maximum in the direction toward the exciting source. The directionality of the emission is dependent on the increase of n, because the excitation process involves the nth power of the intensity I n (r). The ratio Rf= P(180 \u2022 )/P(90 \u2022 ) increases from 1.8 to 9 when n changes from 1 to 3 (P is the emitted light power). For 3PEF, fluorescence from aerosol microparticles is therefore mainly backwards emitted, which is ideal for Lidar experiments. For n = 5 photons we investigated laser induced breakdown (LIBS) in water microdroplets, initiated by multiphoton ionization. The ionization potential of water molecules is E ion =6.5 eV, so that 5 photons are required at a laser wavelength of 800 nm to initiate the process of plasma formation. The growth of the plasma is also a nonlinear function of I n (r). We showed that both localization and backward enhancement strongly increases with the order n of the multiphoton process, exceeding Rf = U(180 \u2022 )/U(90 \u2022 ) = 35 for n = 5 [214] . As for MPEF, LIBS has the potential of providing information about the aerosols composition.",

Riboflavin was excited by two photons at 800 nm and emitted a broad fluorescence around 540 nm. This experiment [215, 216] is the first demonstration of the remote detection of bioaerosols using a 2PEF-femtosecond Lidar. The broad fluorescence signature is clearly observed from the particle cloud (typ. 10 4 p/cm 3 ), with a range resolution of a few meters (Fig. 9.46) . As a comparison, droplets of pure water do not exhibit any parasitic fluorescence in this spectral range. However, a background is observed for both types of particles, arising from the scattering of white light generated by filaments in air. Primarily, MPEF might be advantageous as compared to linear LIF for the following reasons: (1) MPEF is enhanced in the backward direction and (2) the transmission of the atmosphere is much higher for longer wavelengths. For example, if we consider the detection of tryptophan (another typical biotracer that can be excited with 3 photons of 810 nm), the transmission of the atmosphere is typically 0.6 km \u22121 at 270 nm, whereas it is 3 \u00b7 10 \u22123 km \u22121 at 810 nm (for a clear atmosphere, depending on the background ozone concentration). This compensates the lower 3-PEF cross-section compared to the 1-PEF cross-section at distances larger than a couple of kilometers. The most attractive feature of MPEF is, however, the possibility of using pump-probe techniques, as described hereafter in order to discriminate bioaerosols from background interferents such as traffic related soot or PAHs.",

While mineral and carbon black particles do not have strong fluorescence signals, aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from organic particles and Diesel soot strongly interfere with biological fluorophors such as amino acids [202, 204] . The similarity between the spectral signatures of organic and biological molecules under UV-Vis excitation lies in the fact that similar \u03c0-electrons from carbonic rings are involved. Therefore, aromatics or PAHs (such as naphthalene) exhibit absorption and emission bands similar to those of amino acids like Tyrosine or Trp. Some shifts are present because of differences in specific bonds and the number of aromatic rings, but the broad featureless nature of the bands renders them almost indistinguishable. Moreover, the different environments of Trp in bacteria (e.g., they are contained in many proteins) and the mixtures of PAHs in transportation generated particles, blur their signatures. As shown before in Fig. 9 .43, the fluorescence spectra (resulting from excitation at 270 nm) of Trp, Bacillus Subtilis and Diesel fuel are almost identical.",

This approach makes use of two physical processes beyond that available in the usual fluorescence spectrum: (1) the dynamics in the intermediate pumped state and (2) the coupling efficiency to a higher lying excited state. More precisely, as shown in Fig. 9 .47, a femtosecond pump pulse ( \u03c4 =120fs) at 270 nm transfers a portion of the ground state S 0 population of Trp to its S 1 ({v'}) excited state (corresponding to a set of vibronic levels, i.e., {v'}). The vibronic excitation relaxes by internal energy redistribution to lower {v'} modes, associated with charge transfer processes (CT), conformational relaxation, and intersystem crossing with repulsive \u03c0\u03c3 * states [218] . After vibronic energy redistribution, fluorescence is emitted from second pulse (probe) at 800 nm after a certain time delay from the pump pulse, the S 1 population is decreased and the fluorescence depleted. The 800 nm femtosecond laser pulse induces a transition from S 1 to an ensemble of higher lying S n states, which are likely to be autoionizing [219] , but also undergo radiationless relaxation into S 0 [220] . By varying the temporal delay between the pump and probe, the dynamics of the internal energy redistribution within the intermediate excited potential surface S 1 is explored. In principle, as different species have distinct S 1 surfaces, discriminating signals can be enhanced in this fashion. Figure 9 .48 shows the pump-probe depletion dynamics of the S 1 state in Trp as compared to a circulation of Diesel fuel and Naphthalene in cyclohexane, one of the most abundant fluorescing PAHs in Diesel. While depletion reaches as much as 50% in Trp for an optimum delay of \u2206t = 2 ps, Diesel fuel and Naphthalene appear almost unaffected (within a few percent), at least on these timescales. This remarkable difference allows for efficient discrimination between Trp and organic species, although they exhibit very similar linear excitation/fluorescence spectra ( Fig. 9.43 ). Two reasons might be invoked to understand this difference: (1) the intermediate state dynamics is predominantly influenced by the NH-and CO-groups of the amino acid backbone and (2) the ionization potential and other excited states are higher for the PAHs contained in Diesel than for Trp by about 1 eV so that excitation induced by the probe laser is much less likely in the organic compounds. The particular dynamics of the internal energy redistribution in the S 1 state of Trp ( Fig. 9.48) , and in particular the time needed to start efficient depletion, is not fully interpreted as yet. Further electronic structure calculations are required to better understand the process, especially on the higher lying S n potential surfaces.",

The observed pump-probe depletion results are remarkably robust ( Fig. 9 .49), with similar depletion values for all the considered bacteria (results for Enterococcus, not shown in the figure, are identical), although the Trp microenvironment within the bacteria proteins is very different from water. These unique features can be used for a novel selective bioaerosol detection technique that avoids interference from background traffic related organic particles in the air: The excitation shall consist of a pump-probe sequence with the optimum delay \u2206t = 2ps, and the fluorescence emitted by the mixture will be measured as the probe laser is alternately switched on and off. This pump-probe two-photon differential fluorescence method will be especially attractive for an active remote detection technique such as MPEF-Lidar, where the lack of discrimination between bioaerosols and transportation related organics is currently most acute.",

Although nanosecond-laser LIBS (nano-LIBS) has already been applied to the study of bacteria [221, 222] , femtosecond lasers open new perspectives in this respect. The plasma temperature is, indeed, much lower in the case of femtosecond excitation, which strongly reduces the blackbody background and interfering lines from excited N 2 and O 2 from the air. This allows performing time gated detection with very short delays, and thus observing much richer and cleaner spectra from the biological sample. This crucial advantage is shown in Fig. 9 .50, where the K line emitted by a sample of Escherichia coli is clearly detected in femto-LIBS and almost unobservable under ns-laser excitation [223] . Thanks to the low thermal background in fs-LIBS, 20-50 lines are recorded for each bacterial sample considered in the study (Acinetobacter, Escherichia coli, Erwinia, Shewanella and Bacillus subtilis) . A systematic sorting with sophisticated algorithms is in progress in order to evaluate whether the spectra are sufficiently different to unambiguously identify each species [224] . The results are already promising and we show ( Fig. 9.51) , as an example, the difference between Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis for the Li line intensity (also observed for the Ca line). This observation can be un- derstood by the typical difference of the cell wall structure between a Gram+ and a Gram-bacterium. The ratio of these lines as compared to Na for example constitutes an \"all optical Gram test\". Low temperature plasma is not the only advantage of fs-LIBS: the ablation process itself seems different. fs-LIBS acts more as a direct bond-breaking and evaporation process instead of thermal vaporization. This particular ablation process could be put into evidence as not only atoms and ions lines were observed but also molecular signatures such as CN or C 2 [225] . It was shown in particular that these molecular species are directly ablated from the sample, and not created by recombination of C atoms or ions with Nitrogen from the air (which occurs for ns excitation). Obtaining molecular signatures in addition to trace elements is a significant improvement of the method. The presence of CN molecules is, for instance, a good indicator for a biological material.",

The technique can also be applied for the remote detection of the microorganisms, if a nonlinear Lidar based configuration is chosen, as for the Teramobile. A more difficult task will be the distinction of one bacteria species from another, and in particular the identification of pathogen from nonpathogen bioaerosols. A possible way to reach this difficult goal might be ODD. Another option could be provided by LIBS, as the wealth of emission lines under femtosecond excitation might allow to target some biological process that is characteristic from one type of bacteria. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that LIBS could also be performed with a femtosecond-Lidar [226] and thus allow remote identification of particles in air.",

In particular, the strength of femtosecond spectroscopy for characterization of key reactive events and relaxation pathways, and identification of important inter-and intramolecular interactions has been illustrated in this chapter. Another avenue of growing importance is the use of femtosecond laser spectroscopies to obtain structure information in real-time on changes induced by optical excitation. For example, the monitoring of time-dependent absorption band shifts of tryptophan residues, induced by excitation of nearby bacteriorhodopsin was shown as a tool to this end. These experiments established the connection between translocation of charge [27] and the skeletal changes of the conjugate chain [23] . In addition, it also stressed the role of the dynamic electric force fields, which drive structural dynamics and govern enzymatic reactions. The capacity of infrared probing for determine the orientations of molecular electronic transition dipole moments within the molecular frame was moreover demonstrated on anthracene-endoperoxide, and in combination with quantum mechanical calculations a definitive assignment of reactive electronic states could be made. For more complex biological systems and for tackling both the fast and the slower dynamics, Molecular Dynamics simulations, such as presented in Sect. 9.6, will prove to be a powerful tool for singling out crucial 3-dimensional conformations that can be connected to key events. Methods such as these, are expected to greatly contribute in the near future to enhancing our knowledge of 3-dimensional structural details in complex biological systems and their connection to the mechanisms that govern essential biological processes.",

These inherently multiphoton techniques can also be used to investigate excitation interactions in multichromophore systems [59, 60] . These new abilities allow significant new insights into fundamental biological events governing photosynthetic light harvesting [49, 59, 60, 82] , biological proton transfer reactions [69] and primary photoreception events [48, 48] . The fact that the control is achieved by manipulating electronic state populations allows the clear and concise interpretations of the experimental data.",

Input parameters for control possibilities are the amplitude (intensity), the phase, and the polarization of the different applied electromagnetic frequencies. We are only standing at the beginning of the tremendously exciting road of experimentally testing the possibilities optically altering the natural outcome biological processes.",

Symbols are the experimental data and the solid lines are the results of the global fits to these data. Note that the time axis is linear up to 5 ps, and then logarithmic to 1 ns.(445 nm). However, the relative magnitude of the GSB recovery at 445 nm (\u223c25%) is not comparable with the depletion of the SE and ESA (\u223c50%), suggesting the involvement of a third intermediate state that temporarily stores ground-state population before refilling the bleach on a longer timescale. This ground state intermediate (GSI) is more clearly observed as an increase in the dump-induced absorption in the 480 nm and 490 nm traces, where a local maximum in both the PP and the PDP signals is observed. The structural basis of this intermediate state is not known; it may originate from a competing structural rearrangement motion (e.g. rotation about one of the sigma bonds, instead of the double bond of the chromophore) or from a local minimum in the ground state potential energy along the isomerization coordinate. The smaller dump effect in the 350-nm trace is indicative of the insensitivity of the overlapping radical contribution to the dump pulse; this observation is useful for characterizing photoionization properties. Such characterization was performed by measuring the action trace with the probe pulse placed at 500 ps after the excitation and scanning the dump pulse. This action trace is shown inFig. 9.23, which shows the dump effect as a function of dump delay on the GSB (red triangles), I 0 induced absorption (green diamonds), Action trace of PYP, measured with probe time at 500 ps. Plotted is the \u2206\u2206OD rel signal (PDP-PP)/PP vs. the dump time. The red triangles are the dump-induced depletion of the bleach (446 nm) and the green diamonds are the induced-depletion of the I0 photoproduct absorption (510 nm). The black squares and blue circles are the depletion of the radical (370 nm) and the ejected electron (620 nm) respectively. The amplitude of the PP signals were 13 mOD (radical), 30 mOD (bleach), 12 mOD (I 0) and 4 mOD (electron). Overlapping the bleach and I 0 signals is the fitted excited state population resulting from global analysis.",
