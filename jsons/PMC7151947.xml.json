It is estimated that between 5% and 10% of patients admitted to acute care hospitals acquire one or more infections. Using a multistep approach and three data sources, the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that the number of HAIs in US hospitals in 2002 was approximately 1.7 million. Thirty-two percent of all HAIs were urinary tract infections, 22% surgical site infections, 15% pneumonia and 14% bloodstream infections. The estimated number of deaths associated with HAIs in US hospitals in this study was approximately 99 000. The total number of deaths associated with HAIs by major site was highest for pneumonia (35 967) and bloodstream infection (30 655). The additional cost of patient care attributable to these infections was estimated to be $4.5\u20135.7 billion per year.3,\n4 In the UK in 2000, it was estimated that 100 000 cases of hospital-acquired infection occurred in England with 5000 deaths, costing the National Health Services (NHS) as much as \u00a31bn ($1.4bn) a year.5\n",

This will initially require a risk stratification to determine what the critical targets of surveillance should be. In the USA and other developed countries, many surveillance activities will be mandated by local or federal authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Hospital Association and the regulatory efforts of the Joint Commission (TJC). Other surveillance activities will vary, based on an understanding of the epidemiology and risk at a particular institution. For instance, surveillance for invasive aspergillosis in an institution undergoing new construction and with a large compromised host population might be rated a higher priority than the long-term monitoring of Legionella in an institution where Legionella has not been identified for years. Each hospital must tailor its surveillance activities based on risk assessment of the population as well as the available resources within the infection control team and hospital. Such \u2018targeted\u2019 surveillance should be defined for each hospital.10\n",

            "text": "A number of components are critical for an effective surveillance system. 1.Clear and uniform definitions of the infection or other outcome should be developed. Often, standardized definitions such as those defined by the CDC are the most useful so that comparisons can be made both within the system and with other institutions.11\n2.Surveillance should be an active process that includes review of microbiologic data, clinical and nursing records, pharmacologic and pathologic data, readmission and reoperation data following surgery for selected procedures, etc. These data are made more easily accessible by computer-based patient records and other electronic systems for data retrieval and coordination. Indeed, automated surveillance systems for infection control may provide a sensitive, specific, time-efficient and cost-effective mechanism for surveillance in many institutions.12,\n13 The surveillance methodology should rely on metrics that are objective, standardized and risk adjusted. Case validation by the practitioners of the procedural area under evaluation should be avoided; in this setting the process may be prone to bias and lose objectivity, especially if financial incentives are involved. On the other hand, periodic review of the case definitions and feedback on the surveillance should include members of the practice team in order to provide insights not necessarily within the skill set of the infection control team and to devise corrective quality improvement actions adapted to that specific practice.3.Whatever the system of surveillance is, both numerator and denominator data must be available for review. For instance, central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are generally expressed as number of CLABSI/number of central line days \u00d7 1000. This allows the surveillance to be expressed as a rate such that trends can be tracked and compared within and between institutions.14\n4.Appropriate benchmarking should be sought. Increasingly, health-care systems are being asked to compare their rates of events to other institutions. In the USA between 1992 and 2004 the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System collected data regarding targeted infections from participating tertiary care hospitals; this system was reorganized in 2005 under the National Health and Safety Network (NHSN). Data provided from this network can be used for benchmarking infections between hospitals. However, although standardized data may be useful for identifying areas deserving more intensive interventions within a given institution, differences in hospital size, patient mix and risk adjustment introduce complexity when comparing rates across the spectrum from smaller community hospitals to tertiary care and specialty hospitals.15,\n16\n5.Reports describing the surveillance activities and findings should be prepared (using appropriate statistical analysis) and distributed to the appropriate groups, which should include the services associated with the monitoring process and the administrative liaison affiliated with the service.6.After feedback to the particular service is provided, that service (generally in conjunction with the IPCP) should develop an action plan for process improvement, if needed. This plan, after approval by all relevant parties, should be implemented. If possible, the next surveillance cycle should be used to evaluate if improvements occurred associated with the action plan.\n",

In a health-care setting, the \u2018background\u2019 rate may be provided by ongoing surveillance activities as described above. In the health-care setting, prompt identification of an outbreak and intervention on the part of the IPCP is critical in preventing adverse outcomes and accruing costs. Whether the outbreak under investigation is SARS or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or an increase in the baseline rate of hip prosthesis infection, the same basic components of outbreak investigation are followed, as outlined in Table 6.2\n.17,\n18 An example of a functional surveillance program laying the groundwork for an outbreak investigation would be as follows: Hospital X performs a large number of hip joint replacements, and this is a procedure monitored by IPCP (Fig. 6.1). Standardized NHSN criteria are used to define surgical site infections (SSIs) for hip prosthesis. Hospital X's surveillance for hip prosthesis involves review of all microbiology data for all hip replacements done at the institution plus readmission data after hip replacement, as well as antibiotic utilization data for patients with hip replacement. Charts are then reviewed to evaluate if a hip infection occurred and at what level (superficial, deep or organ space, by NHSN criteria).It is noted that in July, there was a large increase in the rate of hip infections that was two standard deviations above the institutional mean and over the 75th percentile for NHSN hip infection rate. Charts are reviewed to confirm, and an epidemic curve is generated suggesting that the increase in infection started in mid July. This information is reported back to Orthopedics as well as Hospital Administration. Patient data review indicates that the infections are with multiple different organisms, with procedures performed with multiple different surgeries in different ORs.It is noted by one of the health-care workers interviewed that a new surgical scrub was put into place in late June in the orthopedic ORs, and the concern is raised that the increased infection rate may be associated with this. A review reveals that the new scrub is not being used per recommendations. A plan to develop and implement an educational module regarding surgical scrub is enacted, and by September infection rates in this procedure are back to baseline.\n",
