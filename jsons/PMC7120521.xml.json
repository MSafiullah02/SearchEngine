Symptoms pertain to the system involved, but diagnosis may be difficult unless a high degree of suspicion is maintained. Tissue or fluid samples from the involved organs with staining, Mycobacterial cultures or molecular probe assays are often diagnostic although radiological patterns in specific cases may be very suggestive of the process (e.g. vertebral involvement with a paraspinal abscess) (Lewinsohn et al. 2017).",

Thus a positive GeneXpert test makes a presumptive diagnosis of MDR-TB (Steingart et al. 2009). The test is more sensitive than direct microscopy and extremely specific (Steingart et al. 2014). The test is not infallible, however, and any result that is discordant with the clinical picture should either be repeated or further information sought using another modality. False-positive NAAT results can occur due to laboratory contamination. Importantly, NAAT can detect nucleic acid from dead non-viable bacilli, and so a positive test after completion of the course of treatment has no relevance in that situation (Boyles et al. 2014) nor is it of relevance in monitoring response to treatment (Friedrich et al. 2013). It is important to realize that NAAT is not a substitute for AFB smear and culture testing; culture is essential for species identification and for drug susceptibility testing (Cheng et al. 2005). A more sensitive version of Xpert has been developed.",

Conventional culture (Lowenstein-Jensen medium and its variants) is capable of detecting as few as ten bacteria per millilitre with the sensitivity and specificity of sputum culture approximating 80 and 98%, respectively (Morgan et al. 1983). Following initial culture, species identification is done by any of the following techniques: biochemical methods (testing, nucleic acid hybridization probes, high-pressure liquid chromatography or mass spectrophotometry). Drug sensitivity testing is subsequently carried out, usually at a reference laboratory (Shinnick and Good 1995) to first-line anti-tubercular agents, but sometimes to second-line agents as well when resistance to components of first-line anti-tubercular agents has been documented. In individuals living with HIV who have CD4 counts <100 cells/mm3, or those who are immunocompromised, Mycobacterial cultures of blood and urine should complement conventional testing. Point-of-care urinary detection of lipoarabinomannan, a component of the Mycobacterial cell wall (urine LAM test) may be useful for HIV-infected individuals, and its use may possibly confer a mortality benefit (Reported tuberculosis in the United States, 2013 2014). The future of point-of-care devices is next-generation sequencing, and, perhaps, innovations like detection of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath (Garcia-Basteiro et al. 2018)",

It is important to realize that TB can occur at all \u201cstages\u201d of HIV disease. The clinical presentation of HIV patients who have relatively high CD4 counts is no different to that which occurs in individuals without HIV. Such individuals manifest with the classical manifestations of post-primary tuberculosis such as upper lobe infiltrates. On the other hand, lower lobe involvement, pleural effusions and intrathoracic lymphadenopathy are common in individuals with low CD4 counts (typically <200/\u03bcL). Indeed the chest X-ray may sometimes only show vague interstitial infiltrates or even be normal (Mayer and Dukes Hamilton 2010). Taken together, the fact that in advanced HIV disease (a) the sputum is less likely to be positive for AFB (b) the PPD is usually non-reactive (c) the X-ray abnormalities are likely to represent other opportunistic infections or even non-infective conditions associated with HIV disease and (d) histopathology of involved tissues is characterized by lack of typical granulomata; these considerations make the diagnosis extremely challenging in this setting.

Haemoptysis is frequently one of the remote sequelae and can on occasion be life-threatening. An unresolved cavity is frequently the cause, and bleeding from an unsupported blood vessel in the cavity wall or in a post tubercular bronchiectatic segment can be a source of troublesome bleed. Cavities colonized by fungi (aspergillomas), broncholiths eroding into the bronchial wall and rarely expansion and subsequent rupture of an unsupported blood vessel in the cavity wall (Rasmussen\u2019s aneurysm) can cause massive haemoptysis (van den Heuvel and van Rensburg 2006). A scar carcinoma sometimes develops in an area of fibrosis and may sometimes be difficult to distinguish from a dense fibrotic infiltrate (Gao et al. 2015). Post-tubercular bronchiectasis is predisposed to when caseation necrosis and inflammation with retention of secretions leads to destruction of bronchial walls with ensuing permanent dilatation. Sometimes compression of bronchial lumen by enlarged lymph node can produce bronchiectasis by a different mechanism. Post-primary TB involves the upper lobes of the lung, and so the gravitationally advantaged upper lobes do not usually undergo a process of chronic and recurrent infection unlike the lower lobes that are involved by bronchiectasis of other aetiologies.",

Side effects are possible with any of the anti-tubercular agents, and on rare occasions, they may be serious and even fatal. The risk of liver injury with anti-TB therapy is always a concern. Among the four first-line agents INH, rifampicin and pyrazinamide are all capable of causing hepatotoxicity. Isoniazid is capable of causing asymptomatic mild elevation in transaminases in 15\u201320% as well as fatal severe acute hepatitis in 0.05\u20131%. Jaundice with liver injury can occur in 0.5\u20131%. Peripheral neuropathy due to pyridoxine deficiency can occur with INH therapy in up to 6.5% of elderly individuals (Ruan et al. 2018); pyridoxine supplementation is required for all patients taking INH (John 2019). Factors increasing the chances of INH hepatotoxicity include age, female gender, alcohol use, prior hepatitis, concurrent use of cytochrome-inducing agents and slow acetylator status (Sharma et al. 2016). Acute INH toxicity can present as seizures due to decreased GABA levels. INH is metabolized to several metabolites including the hepatotoxic metabolite hydrazine, toxic-free radicals and mono-methylhydrazine. Degradation by acetylation occurs via N-acetyltransferase-2 gene (NAT2); a deficiency of the NAT enzyme can lead to accumulation of hepatotoxic metabolite. Ten percent of patients with anti-tubercular drug-induced hepatotoxicity show progression to acute liver failure; the rest are self-limited (Badrinath and John 2018).",

Of these, 0.4 million are HIV patients who die mostly in LMIC (low- and middle-income countries) (WHO Global TB report 2017; www.who.int). Within the next 16 years, the goal is to reduce TB incidence by 90% but the progress has been painfully slow. The most effective way to reduce the burden of TB in the community, to date, has been to identify patients affected with TB as early as possible and to treat them effectively with anti-tubercular therapy.",

Yet its effect has been inconsistent, ranging from 80% to zero protection; several factors including geographical differences appear to play a role (British adolescents had better responses than South Indian participants perhaps due to background exposure to MTB or atypical mycobacteria). The efficacy of BCG has been most manifested in its protection of infants and young children from the dangerous forms of TB (such as disseminated \u201cmiliary\u201d TB and TB meningitis). Also, its effects appear to wane with time (Hasan 2014).",
