On 21 February, the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences agreed to a request for the donation of remdesivir for compassionate use in individual patients seriously affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and hospitalised at Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. A report containing the clinical information and laboratory test results of each eligible patient requiring oxygen supplementation was sent to Gilead for approval. Enrolment in the programme ended on March 20, 2020 as it was planned to start a randomised, controlled, double- blind clinical trial aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in hospitalised patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 respiratory disease [18]. Pending the results of this trial, we report the outcomes of 35 patients who received compassionate remdesivir treatment during the first days of the Italian SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.",

The most frequent severe AE was increase in liver enzymes, a finding in line with data of the multicenter compassionate study by Grein et al. [28]. Moreover, four of our patients who started remdesivir treatment in the ICU developed AKI, and three of them eventually died; however, it is difficult to say whether the AKI was caused by the infection itself, remdesivir, or any of the other administered medications. Since LPV/r was discontinued 24 hour before the administration of remdesivir we believe that the AEs were likely independent of that previous treatment although it cannot fully excluded.",

First, given the context in which it originated, it was impossible to include a control group so we cannot exclude the possibility that the patients whose hospitalisation status improved after remdesivir treatment may have improved regardless of any treatment. Secondly, most of our patients had previously received LPV/r + HQC and this may represent a confounding factor when analysing the efficacy of remdesivir. Finally, we could not predefine a virological follow-up which limits our finding of a possible virological effect of remdesivir in inducing the clearance of viral RNA in the patients' respiratory samples.",
