Efficient monitoring of infectious disease transmission is critical to 14 prevent and manage infectious disease epidemics. Wastewater-based epidemiology 15 (WBE) is an efficient approach with great potential for early warning of infectious 16 disease transmission and outbreaks. By analysing infectious disease biomarkers in 17 wastewater taken from wastewater collection points, the transmission of infectious 18 diseases in certain areas can be comprehensively monitored in near real time. This 19 short review presents WBE as a surveillance and early warning system for infectious 20 disease outbreaks regarding pathogens with pandemic potential. We also discuss the 21 challenges and perspective of WBE in infectious disease surveillance and early 22 warning.",

            "text": "Recently, the novel pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus 28 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread worldwide and become a pandemic, despite 29 city-wide quarantines and travel bans in many countries [1] . By April 15, 2020, Integral components of public health include strengthening the supervision of 36 infectious diseases, realizing early warning and preventing infectious disease 37 pandemics, especially emerging infectious diseases. There are many technologies to 38 surveil the spatial-temporal characteristics of infectious diseases, such as sentinel 39 surveillance, clinical-based surveillance, questionnaires or surveys, hospital admission 40 data, mortality and morbidity rates, which hold great significance for infectious 41 disease surveillance [4] . However, most of these approaches depend on acquired data 42 and information, such as incidence and mortality rates, prescription data and 43 hospitalization information, and herein, most of these systems are passive monitoring 44 forms. Therefore, these techniques are subject to bias, resource insensitivity, detection 45 blindness and high cost [5] . Taking countries with limited health services as an 46 example, the incidence rate may be higher than the assumed value due to a lack of 47 access to health services [6] . There are blind areas for epidemic monitoring using 48 traditional techniques. Because infectious disease testing is not available to everyone, 49 potential patients and asymptomatic patients cannot be effectively counted and 50 monitored, leading to an unknown extent of the spread. For example, it has been reported 51 that approximately 60% of asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infections may lead to a 52 second outbreak [7] . Sometimes in serious epidemics, laboratory facilities are easily 53 overburdened, and many cases are not reported. In addition, with the acceleration of 54 global urbanization and the unprecedented growth in population, higher requirements 55 are proposed for rapid health monitoring and response, which undoubtedly poses a 56 challenge to the existing infectious disease monitoring and management system. 57 Therefore, novel monitoring and management approaches are needed for the 58 prevention and early warning of infectious diseases. These technologies should be 59 flexible, cost effective and scalable and should provide comprehensive and objective 60 data in real time. Meanwhile, they also need to monitor multiple diseases, even rare 61 diseases, in limited resource settings. Considering the current insufficient clinical and 62 laboratory information [8] , it is valuable to provide a novel surveillance and early 63 warning techniques to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional tools/methods 64 and to provide comprehensive and timely population exposure and disease results.",

Therefore, we first briefly introduce the principle of WBE and its wide application. to key aspects of infectious disease information. In addition, not only can the 122 spatial-temporal trends be determined but this information can also be monitored in In addition, the ultimate goal of WBE is to achieve on-site monitoring and provide 207 real-time data, which is also a guarantee of using WBE to provide early warning 208 timeliness of infectious disease outbreaks. Analytical tools are required for simple, 209 rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, selective and multi-target analysis. The latest 210 developments in sensor methods make field measurements possible so that the system 211 can provide real-time infectious disease and public health information (see Figure 2 ). 212 We also propose tracing COVID sources using an inexpensive and efficient 213 paper-based biosensor [43] . At present, the research in this area is relatively weak, and only a few scientists have performed related studies [21] . This is an important 215 challenge for WBE with a wide application of early warning of infectious diseases, 216 and many more scientists should focus on this technical limitation in the future. biomarker concentration must also be within a certain range to detect biomarkers in 226 wastewater downstream [44] . Another important feature is that biomarkers must be 227 stable, not only in wastewater systems but also during sampling and storage [45] . 228 Therefore, it is important to find suitable biomarkers for specific infectious diseases ",

It is important that as a whole, 81 the population contributes to the collection of wastewater from any wastewater 82 collection point, and the wastewater from this community can be regarded as its 83 collected urine. It is assumed that the identification and quantification of exogenous 84 and endogenous biomarkers in community wastewater reflects the health status of the 85 community population in real time. These biomarkers are derived from specific 86 human excretions (such as metabolites or endogenous chemicals resulting from 87 exposure to and/or disease) [9], as well as associated microorganisms/pathogens [10], 88 which can reflect the health and living habits of the community because they contain 89 rich biological and chemical information.",

Later, Zuccato et al achieved the goal of WBE for the first 93 time in 2005 by successfully quantifying cocaine in wastewater to investigate cocaine 94 consumption in the community [12]. Since then, research on WBE has been 95 conducted around the world [13]. Initially, the focus was entirely on the abuse of 96 illicit drugs (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/activities/wastewater-analysis), such as 97 heroin[14], cocaine[15], ketamine[16], methamphetamine[13] and new psychoactive 98 substances[17]. Most countries have monitored the use of illicit drugs through WBE 99 for epidemiological studies. Notably, China uses WBE for practical policy making 100 and action related to drug control activity[18]. 101 To date, apart from the evaluation of drug abuse, WBE has been expanded to 102 various biomarkers [9], such as pesticides[5] and even heavy metals[19]. The scope of 103 application of WBE ranges from the assessment of drug abuse and population health 104 to the assessment of social, demographic, and economic correlates of food and 105 chemical consumption [20]. WBE has also been successful in monitoring drug 106 consumption, lifestyle choice and population exposure.",

Due to the wide variety of endogenous chemical 111 and biological biomarkers related to diseases, the potential of WBE for monitoring 112 infectious disease outbreaks and epidemic transmission at the community level is 113 obvious [4]. 114 WBE can be used as a complementary monitoring technique to provide rapid and 115 reliable information about the population to inform the community of what diseases 116 exist and help to monitor disease outbreaks (see Figure 1). When the presence of 117 biomarkers is reported, the daily load in the wastewater is usually reported.

The pathogenic information includes 137 pathogens from bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms that cause serious 138 infectious diseases. Pathogen detection of wastewater influent could trace the source 139 of pathogen carriers through pipeline backtracking, thus identifying the area of disease 140 spread in the population. There have been many reports about virus determination in 141 wastewater [23-26]. Wastewater analysis of polio has been used since the 1980s, 142 when Finland[27] and Israel[28] successfully analysed wastewater to assess the 143 spread of polio. The WHO has issued guidelines for monitoring polio in wastewater 144 samples using environmental monitoring [4]. Wastewater analysis can also be used 145 for retrospective prediction of the outbreak of hepatitis A and norovirus[29]. In terms 146 of the COVID-19 pandemic, many scientists are trying to use WBE to detect 147 SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to screen potential virus carriers and provide early 148 warning of COVID-19 outbreaks in the community [30]. 149 Another important consideration is the host-guest information caused by infectious 150 diseases, such as cough, blood protein, inflammatory, and immune information. For 151 diagnostic purposes, urinary protein-based biomarkers are considered promising 152 candidates for WBE[31], which is desirable not only because of the non-invasive 153 nature of the test but also because it is a previously unexplored source of potential 154 disease and health biomarkers[32]. The feedback of this information is related to 155 protein-based inflammatory biomarkers, which are a group of important endogenous 156 markers that are sensitive to changes in the body as early indicators of disease[33, 34]. 157 Apart from protein-based biomarkers, other human health biomarkers in wastewater, 158 such as nucleic acids, have been reported [35]. For example, genetic 159 information-related diseases can also be detected in wastewater [36]. It is believed 160 that host-guest information related to infectious diseases in WBE will provide 161 valuable new insights for community public health and have important implications 162 for potential infectious diseases.",

            "text": "principle of WBE is simple and provides an attractive advantage for166    public health monitoring, there are still some challenges to be considered. The first is167    that the wastewater matrix is complex. The biomarker concentration in wastewater is 168 much more dilute than that in urine, and the wastewater substrate is a complex169 working environment[37]. As mentioned above, wastewater contains a wide range of 170 chemical and biological substances that can provide incredible amounts of 171 information about the population. However, one disadvantage of having such a large 172 amount of information is that it must be successfully extracted from the matrix, and 173 subsequent analysis of specific targets may be difficult. Taking protein-based 174 biomarkers as an example, although it is generally believed that proteomics in WBE 175 can provide valuable new insights for community public health, methods for the 176 analysis of proteins in wastewater are lacking[31]. 177 The complexity of the wastewater matrix is also challenging for for pathogen 178 detection. The main method for pathogen analysis is nucleic acid-based PCR, while 179 there are various PCR inhibitors in wastewater, such as fat, protein, and other 180 chemicals, that may affect subsequent PCR analysis. In addition, when DNA/RNA is 181 extracted from PCR inhibitor-rich samples, the various commercial extraction kits 182 sometimes show different efficiency and consistency[38, 39]. This challenges 183 meaningful comparisons across studies and the determination of spatial-temporal 184 trends of pathogens. 185 To solve this problem, progress in molecular biology technology provides new 186 methods for genetic material analysis, including digital PCR (dPCR) and 187 next-generation sequencing technology. In dPCR, the absolute quantity of the target 188 gene is calculated by dividing DNA/RNA samples into thousands of reaction wells 189 and using Poisson distribution statistics. Due to this distribution effect, when analysed 190 by dPCR, the effect of PCR inhibitors in wastewater is small[40]. Next-generation 191 sequencing is another promising technology that provides substantial information 192 about the complex microbial communities in the samples, such as the identification of 193 various pathogens. Therefore, next-generation sequencing represents an important 194 direction in the future.

For 237 example, it is impossible to distinguish whether pathogens in wastewater originate 238 from visitors passing through or from individuals within the community. There are 239 several technologies that can be used to reduce sources of uncertainty related to 240 population size, such as water chemistry parameters of mature analytical methods, 241 which can help to estimate the population contributing to the catchment area of the 242 wastewater collection points during a specific period of time[47, 48]. However, the 243 results are affected by the composition of wastewater, which leads to additional 244 uncertainties related to these techniques, such as sample collection of pathogens in wastewater, whether from catchment residents or not, 247 still provides critical information, as members of the population may unconsciously 248 come into contact with infected individuals. This may indicate possible diseases in the 249 community, thus providing valuable time for proper preparation and response. 250 However, we should objectively recognize the limitations of WBE and develop a 251 reliable and standardized method to make the research more reliable and allow for 252 comparison in the future.",
