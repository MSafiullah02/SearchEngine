            "text": "The entry of viruses into target cells depends on sequential interactions of the viral surface proteins with the cellular receptors, and thus these surface proteins are important for developing antiviral treatments (1). However, it is often difficult to express viral surface proteins in facile recombinant hosts such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), and this hinders antibody or vaccine development. We set out to find a way to identify smaller but soluble viral surface protein fragments for use in screening for possible antigen or vaccine candidates. Compared with linear peptides derived from the surface proteins, soluble fragments may be advantageous as they have the potential to provide discontinuous epitopes. Additionally, it has been suggested that the binding of viral surface proteins to cell receptors may expose sites in the viral proteins otherwise inaccessible (2, 3). In particular, the binding of HIV gp120 to CD4 seems to expose a site that is critical for subsequent binding to the CCR receptor, but which is partially buried in the resting state of the HIV surface protein. This has been implicated as a possible mechanism adopted by the virulent virus to evade the immune surveillance (2, 3). We reasoned that by producing discrete foldable fragments which are taken out of the context of the full-length protein, some of these hidden critical sites might become exposed in the fragments thus obtained. Consequently, these discrete foldable polypeptide fragments might facilitate screening for more effective vaccines or antigen candidates.",

            "text": "Searching for soluble fragments of a polypeptide chain may be achieved by genetic cleavage at predetermined sites based on detailed analysis of the target structure, or by the more traditional protease digestion method (4\u20137). However, the former approach is limited by the generally poor understanding of the structure\u2013function relationship of proteins, while for the latter only a small number of exposed surface sites are accessible to proteases. A random method that in theory can thoroughly and individually analyze all possible folding fragments would be more desirable. To this end, we formulated a dissection scheme that is capable of searching for soluble fragments of a given target in a random but systematic manner, and which is independent of protein function. The solubility of the dissected protein fragments was accessed through expression analysis of these fragments as N-terminal fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP), which has been shown to be a good indicator for the \u201cfoldability\u201d of the upstream polypeptide partner (8, 9). This method using GFP as folding reporter is generally applicable because it does not require structural or functional information on the target proteins. Results from dissection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein and HIV-1 gp120 are presented.",

Target genes can be inserted into the multiple cloning region and placed under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals, and expression is induced by isopropylthio-\u03b2-D-galactoside (IPTG).

We used an in-house GFP-containing vector pET30a-hydA, which was constructed from pQB-2 (13).

The reason for the use of VspI is that there is an NdeI restriction site in the GFP gene.By inputting the gene sequence of HIV-1 HBc2 gp120 (1,446 bp) into the free software DNAworks (http://mcl1.ncifcrf.gov/dnaworks/dnaworks2.html), 66 oligo sequenceswere returned, and synthesized accordingly (15). These oligos were assembled to gp120 by the standard overlapping procedure (24). Then two flanking primers (5\u2032-ATGACC-GAAAAACTGTGGGTGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGCGCTTCTCAC-GTTGAACAACACG-3\u2032) were used to amplify the full-length of gp120 by touch-down PCR.In the random digestion step, the use of DNase I in the presence of MnCl2 is critical as this protocol will generate DNA fragments of relatively uniform sizes, which facilitates the reassembly step (17, also see Note\n5). Other digestion methods often lead to smears of fragments that are difficult to purify and use. Do not use the buffer supplied with the DNase I enzyme, which contains MgCl2 and would lead to smears of digestion products. Additionally, the amounts of the target DNA, DNase I, and the digestion time should be controlled carefully as indicated above. Otherwise, the DNA would be overdigested or underdigested and could not produce appropriately sized fragments.When the random digestion by DNase I is used for some genes, peculiarly a small amount of the full-length gene has been observed even after prolonged incubation. In this case, the digestion mixture should be passed through a column with an appropriate molecular weight cut-off to filter out the full-length gene, followed by a Microcon\u00ae YM-30 column to accomplish the buffer exchange.The manipulation in Subheadings\n3.2.2 and 3.2.3 is in part analogous to the DNA shuffling protocol (24, 25), but unlike the latter, the purpose here is not to produce full-length hybrids from a group of different parental genes, but to generate smaller and different DNA fragments for a single template gene. This reassembly step following DNase I treatment is necessary in order to prepare a large amount of DNA sequences with controlled lengths, which is achieved by tailoring the PCR cycle number used in the reassembly.In our work, several enzymes, that is, T4 DNA polymerase, S1 Nuclease, Mung Bean Nuclease, and Deep Vent\u00ae polymerase, were tested for blunt-ending gene fragments. T4 DNA polymerase yielded the best results.In order to improve the final yield of backbone vector, the manipulation steps should be as few as possible. The heat-sensitive shrimp alkaline phosphatase was used to reduce one purification procedure after dephosphorylation.In order to improve the percentage of positive clones contai-ning larger inserts (inserts of more than 50 amino acids), three principal improvements were made. First, gene fragments resulting from reassembly were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Second, T4 polymerase was denatured with a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit upon the completion of the blunt-ending reaction to prevent residual T4 DNA polymerase activity from degrading DNA in later steps. Third, a second step of the dephosphorylation by heat-liable SAP was incorporated to improve dephosphorylation efficiency.We found that the basal expression level often observed for the pET vectors was sufficient for the expression of gene fragment-GFP fusion. Low IPTG concentrations (lower than 0.1 mM) did not enhance green fluorescent colonies, while higher concentrations only inhibited fluorescent colonies or generated abnormal hallow colonies.\n",
