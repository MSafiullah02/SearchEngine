In response to this uncertainty, people often produce and spread rumors (DiFonzo & Bordia, 2000, 2007). Rumors can be defined as messages that convey information which could be important or relevant but has not yet been verified (Allport & Postman, 1946). During government efforts to protect the public from risks, the spread of unreliable information can create serious problems. Now that so many people get their information from social media, risk experts and government officials worry that the increased dissemination of rumors could worsen public trust in government risk management efforts.",

To prevent the public panic that sometimes results, governments try to publicly refute or deny the rumors, or even threaten legal punishments for people who create and spread them. Several government rumor response strategies have been proposed by institutions such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. However, we still do not know which of these strategies are most effective and why. In the related field of crisis communication, studies tend to focus on how, when crises occur, organizations that are perceived to be responsible for risks might protect their reputations (Coombs & Holladay, 2004; Coombs, 2000). But in research on situations of national-level risks, few studies have investigated which rumor response strategies are effective and what makes them effective.",

Informed by research in rumor psychology and crisis communication (Coombs, 2000; DiFonzo & Bordia, 2000, 2007), it explores three questions. First, what effects do different types of risk rumors have on people\u2019s beliefs in the rumor and their intention to disseminate the rumor? Second, what kinds of rumor response strategies significantly lower rumor beliefs and intentions to disseminate rumors? Drawn from Situational Crisis Communication Theory, the three response strategies examined are refuting the rumor, denying it, and attacking its source. Third, are there possible interaction effects between types of rumor and types of rumor response strategies? We address these research questions in the context of rumors related to food safety risks, specifically radiation-contaminated foods from the seas near Fukushima, Japan. This risk issue takes center stage in this study because, in South Korea for the past seven years, it has received ongoing attention in the public, media, and government agendas.",

Among the disaster\u2019s serious consequences was damage to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Dangerous radioactive material was released into the environment, and thousands of people were evacuated. After the air, land, and seas near Fukushima were found to be contaminated, the neighboring country of South Korea banned imports of agricultural and seafood products originating from the area. For months and years afterward, several rumors about these radiation hazards spread among the South Korean public. Many rumors were about whether Japan was exporting contaminated seafood, and whether the Japanese and South Korean governments were colluding to cover up foisting that food onto unwitting South Korean consumers (Kim & Kim, 2017). In the months immediately after the nuclear accident, sales of Japanese fishery products in South Korea plummeted (Jeong, 2011). One year later in 2012, fish caught from the seas near Fukushima were found to contain dangerously high levels of radioactive cesium (Fish with, 2013). In 2013, the South Korean government widened its ban and issued stricter safety standards on seafood imports from Fukushima and surrounding areas. As recently as April 2018, the legality of these stricter regulations remained under dispute at the World Trade Organization by the Japanese and South Korean governments (Koreans still, 2018; S. Korea files, 2018).",

A 2017 survey conducted by the South Korean Consumers Union reports the following: 46 percent of South Korean consumers support a complete ban of all food imports from Japan; over 50 percent avoid buying Japanese seafood and dairy products; safety concerns are the reason why many have reduced or curtailed their consumption; and substantial numbers of people are concerned that radiation exposure may cause cancer, birth deformities, and hereditary disease. However, in light of current scientific findings, most of these fears are unfounded or at least exaggerated (Koreans still, 2018).",

Compared to experts, lay people are understandably under-informed and uncertain about many risk issues. Risk communication therefore plays a key role in efforts to give people necessary information, cultivate accurate risk perceptions, reduce public uncertainty, and help people make the right decisions for dealing with risks (Walaski, 2011). However, during risk outbreaks one thing that often interferes with these efforts is the spread of rumors. A rumor can be defined as \u201ca proposition for belief of topical reference disseminated without official verification,\u201d and it tends to have three characteristics: first, it is often transmitted, and thereby distorted, through word-of-mouth; second, it provides information regarding particular persons, events, or conditions; third, it serves certain communities\u2019 emotional needs (Knapp, 1944, pp. 22\u201323). Rumors have been classified into several types depending on factors such as content characteristics, discursive quality, valence, time period of occurrence, cause of occurrence, motive of occurrence, and breadth of dissemination (Kim, 1997; Peterson & Gist, 1951).",

During several major disasters and infectious disease outbreaks, rumors have misled people into panicking and taking unnecessary or counterproductive actions such as stocking up on foods and staying home from work (DiFonzo & Bordia, 2007). As a result of misleading rumors spread online during the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea, people were persuaded to avoid health clinics where MERS-infected patients were falsely reported to have been admitted (Lee, 2015). At that time there were also steep sales increases for vitamins and foods that were marketed as, but not proven to be, effective in treating MERS (Choi, 2015).",

In the aftermath of the disaster, the South Korea Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries was compelled to respond to multiple rumors related to Japanese food radiation matters (Japan\u2019s radioactivity, 2013). The rumors claimed that Japan was exporting radiation-contaminated seafood to South Korea, and that the South Korean government and importers were accepting it, selling it to unwitting Korean citizens, and covering up their conspiracy. In this case, the types of unverified claims that were spread illustrate the tendency for risk-related rumors to be negative, inaccurate, conspiracy-laden, and likely to frighten people. In 2013, two years after the Fukushima disaster, persistent rumors about contaminated food imports were so widespread and inaccurate that the South Korean Prime Minister publicly threatened legal punishments for people caught spreading them (Kim & Kim, 2017).",

Several studies of crisis-related rumors in South Korea have focused on how rumor types or rumor characteristics relate to the following variables: rumor-related beliefs about risks, intention to disseminate risk rumors, risk-related purchasing behaviors, and perceptions of the reputations of organizations deemed responsible for causing risks (e.g., Kim, Yoo, & Kahn, 2015; Lee & Kim, 2016; Zhang & Cho, 2017). Among the examined factors that affected rumor beliefs and dissemination intention are channel characteristics (e.g., trust in Internet information: Kim & Kim, 2017; Ryu & Kim, 2016), audience characteristics (involvement, efficacy, emotional reaction: Ahn & Lee, 2011), and information processing (Kwon & Cho, 2017).",

For example, one corporate crisis study found that the conspiracy-type rumor \u2014 a rumor that a particular company or organization is plotting for its own self-interest or hiding important facts \u2014 had a higher level of rumor beliefs than did the contaminating-type rumor \u2014 a rumor that contains claims about a product\u2019s contamination, deformation, or damage that may affect perceptions of the product\u2019s value (Zhang & Cho, 2017). Of interest in national-level risk contexts are the extent to which people believe in rumors and intend to disseminate them. These variables \u2014 rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor \u2014 have been important outcome variables in rumor research because they could lead to serious behavioral consequences. For these reasons, and informed by a content analysis showing that bogie and wedge rumors appear most frequently during risk outbreaks (Yang & Paek, 2018), the current study investigates possible differential effects of rumor type on rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor. Due to a lack of empirical evidence justifying statement of a hypothesis, we propose the following research question.",

In the context of corporate crisis situations, Jang and Cho (2013) also found that the most effective strategies are not passive ones such as denial but rather more aggressive ones such as attacks and refutations via legal actions, evidentiary materials, or formal press conferences. In the current study\u2019s context of risk issues affecting public health, the government\u2019s perceived ability to handle a risk is critical, particularly when rumor sources may not be easily identified. However, if the government attacks rumor sources by threatening punishments, this strategy might have adverse consequences on people\u2019s trust in government and their perceptions of its ability to deal with the risk.

While the role of trust in government in risk rumor contexts has not yet been explored and was not a primary focus of the current study, our instrument included it, and we performed a post-hoc analysis, i.e., ANCOVA with the variable as a covariate. Results show that trust in government did not affect our findings on the main and interaction effects of rumor type and rumor response strategies. However, the trust variable itself had some marginal effects on reduction in rumor beliefs (F(1,934) = 3.05, p =  .08), as well as on intention to disseminate the rumor (F(1,934) = 3.46, p =  .08). This finding suggests that trust in government may be an important element in the rumor management process. Future research about risk rumor management should therefore more closely examine its potential mediating and moderating roles.",

In the context of developing effective crisis response messages, Coombs (2000) has recommended deploying different strategies under different circumstances: when the attacker is identified, refutation and attacking the attacker are more effective; when the attacker is not identified or when attributed corporate responsibility is low, explanation or denial are more effective. Our findings, though, do not support such conditional effects. This result may point to key differences between rumors about risk issues that affect public health and rumors about crisis issues that affect organizations\u2019 reputations. If more studies identify and confirm such differences, risk communicators will be better informed about appropriate ways to respond to rumors during national-level risks.",

Future research should study rumor response strategies in the context of other risks \u2014 e.g., natural disasters, infectious diseases, terrorism \u2014 to see whether our findings are replicable across types of risk. Another limitation is that this study mainly explored the role of rumor type and response strategies on rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor. Future research should further investigate both main and interaction effects of rumor type and response strategies on other outcomes such as uncertainty reduction, emotional reactions, or behavioral responses. Also, in addition to rumor type and response strategy type, various other factors in this process should be taken into consideration, such as characteristics of rumor, rumor source, and audience. Last, another research question worth exploring would be whether the effects of rumor response strategies on reduction of rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor are best explained by cognitive or emotional mechanisms.",

Theoretically, our study integrates insights and findings from rumor psychology and Situational Crisis Communication Theory from the field of public relations to explore effective rumor response strategies in the context of a national-level risk. Practically, our findings suggest that the government\u2019s response to a rumor plays an important role in controlling public beliefs about it. However, to make that control more effective, what matters more is which specific rumor response strategy the government uses. During outbreaks of rumors about risks, particularly food-related risks, the government should aggressively and promptly refute the rumor \u2014 not with flat denials or threats of punitive actions but rather with sufficient evidence and persuasive arguments.",
