We propose a procedure to detect CoVID-19 affected localities using a sewage mass testing and pooling mechanism which has gained ground in recent times. The proposed method named Sewage Pooling Algorithm tests wastewater samples from sewage systems to pinpoint the regions which are affected by maximum chances of the virus spread. The algorithm also uses a priority-based backtracking procedure to perform testing in sewage links depending on the probability of infection in the sub-areas. For places with very rare CoVID cases, we present a gradientbased search method to prune those areas. The proposed method has less human intervention and increases the effective tests/million people over current in-place methods.",

Current evidence suggests that the virus may be excreted in faeces, regardless of diarrhoea or signs of intestinal infection. Studies have shown that CoVID-19 viral RNA fragments can be detected more accurately from patient's (even asymptomatic patient's) stool specimen [6] No one knows about the actual number of people affected with COVID-19. We are only aware of the status of those infectious people who have been tested. Testing is our only window to handle this pandemic situation as we get aware of the way virus is spreading and also actual number of infectious people.In the asymptomatic infectious cases in the community or when people are not sure whether they are infected or not, community sewage detection could determine whether there are CoVID-19 carriers in an area so that effective intervention can be taken as soon as possible. The present testing mechanism is too slow, cost prohibitive and sometimes provide negative results even if the person is infectious. As of now in INDIA, number of samples being tested is 0.03 per thousand people [5] . The proposed mechanism of wide sewage testing is daunting yet more manageable. Studies have shown that SARS COV-2 is highly similar to SARS COV-1 genetically [7] . Now because of the genetic similarity, detection method remains quite similar, and there have been studies regarding the detection method of SARS COV-1 from sewage samples [8] .",

Otherwise, the branches are tested in decreasing order of their probabilities. The procedure is trivially described in Figure 2 . Link \u2212 1 is tested first because it has the maximum probability of infection followed by Link \u2212 2. Link \u2212 3 is pruned because its probability value is below the cut-off. When level \u2212 (i + 1) links are done with the testing, subsequent levels are tested using the same rule until terminal links are tested in a recursive manner. This procedure is known as Priority-based backtracking as probability is guiding this searching procedure.The flowchart for the entire procedure is provided in Figure 3 . The entire approach is named as Sewage Pooling Algorithm presented in Figure 4 . 1.

We find gradient of all links of level \u2212 1 if the concentration at level \u2212 0 is less than a threshold (very low) above which the region is denoted as yellow zone in sewage testing context. As the CoVID cases are less, if the gradient is negative and the concentration value is less than the precision value, there is no CoVID case in that catchment region. This is because the sample size at level \u2212 1 is less than level \u2212 0 or n * . So if there was a positive CoVID case there must be a rise in the CoVID level as a percentage.

For example, it requires proper mixing of the pooled sewage samples but in reality it may not be the case. There may be various organizations in the locality which negatively affects the results. For example, if the area has a hospital treating CoVID patients or a factory emanating chemicals which may change the nature of the wastewater samples, the result will get badly affected. The procedure needs some modifications to make it applicable to real-life situations which is not possible without practical testing and implementations.
