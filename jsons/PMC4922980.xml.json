Recent outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) in poultry throughout Asia have had major economic and health repercussions. First documented human infection with avian influenza virus was in 1997 in Hong Kong where 18 people were affected out of which 4 died. First case was a three year old child who presented with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms and subsequently died five days after admission due to multi organ dysfunction [1].",

These countries were Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan [1]. The occurrence of this disease in humans and reports of death awakened the health authorities globally to the impending disaster. Not only this virus is deadly to human beings, it can also have a devastating impact on booming economies. In a rough estimate severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) epidemic costed South East Asian countries 59 billion dollars in 2003 while it is feared that bird flu is going to have even more devastating financial impact [2].",

Influenza \u2018A\u2019 is further subdivided into strains depending on surface haemagglutinin (H) and Neuraminidase (N) antigens. In human infections usually H1, H2, H3 and N1, N2 are implicated. More than 15 subtypes of H and 9 subtypes of N are recognized [3]. Many of these affect birds, the common lethal ones being H5 and H7. Different strains are denoted as H1N1, H2N2, H3N1, H5N1, H5N2 etc depending on the combinations of these two antigenic variants. The influenza viruses are irregularly shaped spherical particles and have a lipid envelop from the surface of which the \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018N\u2019 glycoproteins project. \u2018H\u2019 is the site by which viruses bind to cell entry. \u2018N\u2019 helps in shedding of Progeny virions from the infected cells [3]. The structure of Influenza virus is depicted in Fig. 1.",

            "text": "All influenza viruses are genetically labile. This helps them in eluding the host defences. The viruses lack the ability to proof read and repair the errors which occur during cell division. These uncorrected errors change the genetic composition of viruses leading to new antigenic variants. These constant, permanent and usually small changes in antigenic composition constitute the phenomenon of \u201cdrift\u201d. However, a second and a more dangerous phenomenon occurs in which influenza viruses, including subtypes from different species can swap or reassort genetic material and merge. This is known as \u201cshift\u201d and can result in a subtype different from both parent viruses. These variants can cause highly lethal pandemic as the population would have no immunity against them and available vaccines would be ineffective [4]. Such antigenic shifts can occur when humans live close to domestic poultry and pigs. Pigs, being capable of harbouring both mammalian and avian strains of influenza virus, can serve as \u201cmixing vessels\u201d in which scrambling of genetic material can occur. Evidence is also emerging that even humans can serve as mixing vessels for almost 15 avian influenza virus subtypes. Once this mixing occurs, the virus acquires the capacity of human-to-human transmission [2].",

In a recently published article on clinical presentations of 10 proven patients with Influenza A (H5N1) infection from Vietnam, authors concluded that Influenza A (H5N1) infection, characterized by fever, respiratory symptoms, and lymphopenia, carries a high risk of death [7]. Although in all these 10 cases, the infection appears to have been acquired directly from infected poultry, the potential exists for genetic reassortment with human influenza viruses and the evolution of human-to-human transmission.",

Use of salicylates, especially in children should be avoided because of fear of Reye's syndrome. Cough suppressants like codeine preparation might be required. Specific antiviral therapy, if indicated, should be started as early as possible, for any beneficial effect. M2 ion-channel inhibitors, like amantidine and rimantidine, are the usual antiviral drugs used for treating these patients. They work by interfering with the replication of influenza viruses. Either can be used in the dosage of 200 mg/d for 3-7 days. The dose, however, has to be reduced in patients with renal dysfunction. The other group of drugs which are being increasingly utilized are the neuraminidase inhibitors e.g. zanamivir and oseltamivir. These drugs exert their action by interfering with the release of viruses from infected cells. Zanamivir is used as an inhalation in the dose of 10 mg twice a day for 5 days. Oseltamivir is used orally 75 mg twice a day for 5 days. A nucleoside analogue, ribavirin, has also been reported to show some benefit when used as an aerosol. The role of vaccines is well established in groups exposed to poultry live-stalk or those who have a predisposition to acquiring the traditional influenza infection. It can also be helpful in lowering the availability of these viruses in the host and thereby lowering the possibility of mixing with other strains. Vaccine against a new strain would take more than 6 months for development and clinical use.",
