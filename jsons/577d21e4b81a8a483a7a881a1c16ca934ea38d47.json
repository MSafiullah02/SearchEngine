Persistent diarrhea and wasting are important and relatively common gastrointestinal illnesses in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) (2). A variety of bacterial and parasitic pathogens have been linked to diarrhea1 illness in patients infected with HIV. These pathogens include agents frequently responsible for diarrhea in HIV-seronegative homosexuals such as ShigeJJa, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia Jamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and others that are perhaps more common in AIDS, such as Cryptosporidium, Isospora belli, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, and cytomegalovirus (3, 4) . Despite extensive investigation, however, an enteric pathogen cannot be identified in some HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (5,6).

After thawing, a 10% suspension of feces in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% sodium azide was made. The samples were tested by (a) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by tive men in Australia. Whereas we both noted that rates of virus detection for symptomatic HIV-infected men with or without diarrhea were similar, Cunningham et al. found a much higher frequency of virus infection in AIDS and ARC patients (50\u00b01, 54%) and in asymptomatic HIV-seropositive men (16%).

Small round particles were seen by immune electron microscopy in three samples and adenovirus was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in six samples from the AIDS group and in the single positive ARC patient. The adenoviruses detected did not belong to groups 40 or 41, which have previously been associated with human diarrhea1 disease (14). Virus detection did not correlate with the presence or absence of diarrhea at the time of sample collection. Although virus detection was more likely to occur in the AIDS group (9% vs. 3% ,$ = 4.40, p < 0.05), the agents we sought do not appear to be important causes of diarrhea in the HIV-infected patients studied. Rather, our results suggest that the increasingly severe immunocompromise implied by progression of an HIV-infected person to ARC and then AIDS can include clinically silent enteric viral opportunists as well as the clinically apparent bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections.
