Estimating phylogenies involves solving an optimization problem, called the phylogenetic estimation problem (PEP), whose versions depend on the criterion used to select a phylogeny among plausible alternatives. This chapter offers an overview of PEP and discuss the most important versions that occur in the literature.",

For example, the use of molecular phylogenetics was of considerable assistance to predict the evolution of human influenza A [8] , to understand the D. Catanzaro relationships between the virulence and the genetic evolution of HIV [55, 66] , to identify emerging viruses as SARS [51] , to recreate and investigate ancestral proteins [17] , to design neuropeptides causing smooth muscle contraction [2] and to relate geographic patterns to macroevolutionary processes [36] . Since no one could observe evolution over thousands or millions of years, a part from known phylogenies ( [57] ), there is no general way to validate empirically a candidate phylogeny for a set of molecular sequences extracted from taxa. For this reason, the literature proposes a number of criteria for selecting one phylogeny from among plausible alternatives. Each criterion adopts its own set of evolutionary hypotheses, whose ability to describe evolution of taxa determines the gap between the real and the true phylogeny, i.e., the gap between the real evolutionary process of taxa and the phylogeny that one would obtain under the same set of hypotheses if all molecular data from taxa were available [9] .",

The phylogeny T that optimizes f and satisfies g is referred to as optimal, and if T approaches the true phylogeny as the amount of molecular data from taxa increases, the corresponding criterion is said to be statistically consistent [32] . The statistical consistency is a desirable property in molecular phylogenetics because it measures the ability of a criterion to recover the true (and hopefully the real) phylogeny of the given molecular data. Later in this chapter, we will show that the consistency property changes from criterion to criterion and in some cases may be even absent.",

A number of authors suggested that the use of the time homogeneous Markov models could overcome the underestimation problem in all those cases in which the hypotheses at the core of the model would properly describe the real evolutionary process of the analyzed sequences [29] . Moreover, in order to compare the evolutionary distances of different pairs of molecular sequences, the authors also proposed to express the evolutionary distances in terms of expected number of substitution events per site rather than the time necessary to transform a sequence into another [29] . In this section, we will present the most general formula currently known in the literature to compute the evolutionary distance from pairwise molecular sequences.

It is worth noting that the Markov conservative hypothesis implies that the determinant of matrix R is equal to zero, i.e., at least one of its eigenvalues is identically zero. Moreover, since any k-leading principal sub-matrix of R, k < 4, has negative determinant, for one of the Sylvester corollaries (see [6, p. 409 ]) all the remaining eigenvalues are negative. Thus, as the spectrum of P.t/ is the exponential spectrum of R, matrix P.t/ has at least one eigenvalue equal to 1, called the maximal Lyapunov exponent, and three eigenvalues lying in the interval OE0; 1. The maximal Lyapunov exponent prevents the presence of chaotic attractors and guarantees that, as t goes to infinity, the generic entry p ij .t/ is non-zero and independent on the starting state i 2 .

It is worth noting that if in one hand the hypothesis of time-reversibility simplifies the formalization of the evolutionary process of a pair of molecular sequences, on the other hand its introduction gives rises to important consequences. In fact, the hypothesis of time-reversibility implies that if we would compare two molecular data whose nucleotide frequencies are in equilibrium, the probability that a nucleotide i undergoes a substitution to nucleotide j would be equal to the probability that a nucleotide j undergoes a substitution to nucleotide i . Thus, given a present-day molecular sequence and its ancestral sequence, it would be impossible to determine which sequence is the present and which is the ancestral one. Hence, the hypothesis of time-reversibility removes the temporality from the evolutionary process. We shall show in the next sections how the paradigms of phylogenetic estimation take advantage of this fact. Below, we provide an example from [79] showing a possible application of (8.9).",

The degree constraint has not necessarily a biological foundation but helped the authors to formalize the evolutionary process.

That evolution proceeds by small rather than smallest changes is due to the fact that the neighborhood of possible alleles that are selected at each instant of the life of a taxon is finite, and perhaps more important, the selective forces acting on the taxon may not be constant throughout its evolution [4, 80] . Over the long term (periods of environmental change, including the intracellular environment), small changes will not generally provide the smallest change.

Since there is no biological justification for that, Pauplin proposed a new paradigm in which all edges of a phylogeny were weighted in the same way.

Unfortunately, this task seems hard, although at present no information about the complexity of BME is known in the literature. Recent advances in the polyhedral combinatorics of BME led to solve exactly instances containing up to 20-25 taxa [13] . However, the size of the instances analyzable to the optimum is still far away from real needs; for this reason, the use of clustering heuristics (Fig. 8.5) , such as the neighbor-joining tree (NJT) ( [70, 75] ), is common to tackle large instances of BME. Possibly, future developments on the polyhedral combinatorics of BME will provide fundamental new insights for the development of more efficient exact approaches to solution of the problem. ",

Moreover, since any edge weight of a phylogeny is de facto an evolutionary distance, also the entries of vector w must satisfy the triangle inequality. This last observation imposes that for each path p rs from taxa r and s in X, the constraint P e2p rs w e x rs;e d rs is satisfied. Hence, Beyer et al. [4] proposed a possible paradigm of phylogenetic estimation consisting of solving the following mixed integer programming model: MELP is a well-known APX-hard problem [26] for which the current exact algorithms described in the literature provide solutions to instances containing not more than a dozen taxa [14] .

This major criticism could be possibly overcome using non-homogeneous Markov models. Specifically, in a non-homogeneous Markov model, the Chapman-Kolmogorov master equation becomes [84] : since it is possible to prove that (8.16) converges to matrix P.0; t/ when k ! 1 [18] . Hence, under a non-homogeneous Markov model, the substitution probability matrix could be easily computed by means of iterative procedures that appropriately approximate (8.15 ). Concerning the second drawback, it is easy to realize that the NP-hardness of the minimum evolution paradigms constitutes a big handicap for the development of exact solution approaches of practical use. Exact approaches are necessary to guarantee the optimality of a given solution and fundamental to investigate whether the hypotheses at the core of a criterion are well suited to describe the evolutionary process of the observed taxa. At present, most molecular datasets involve hundreds of taxa, whereas the current exact solution approaches have difficulty to tackle instances containing more than two dozen taxa (even smaller for the linear programming paradigm). Increasing the size of the datasets analyzable to the optimum is possibly one of the most challenging problems in molecular phylogenetics and warrants for sure further research efforts.",

The recursive nature of the likelihood function and the intractability of computing the denominator of Bayes' theorem prevent an analytical approach to solution of the bayesian paradigm. Hence, the maximum a posteriori phylogeny is usually computed by means of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [30] , i.e., an algorithm that samples B.T; S; M / through a stochastic generation of phylogenies in T ( [49, 52, 83] ). Sampling B.T; S; M / is extremely time consuming; therefore, the bayesian estimations may take even weeks [42] . However, as observed by Yang [82] and Huelsenbeck et al. [41, 43] , the sampling process has also the indisputable benefit of providing a measure of the reliability of the best-so-far solution found. In fact, by sampling stochastically around the (best local) maximum a posteriori phylogeny T , the bayesian paradigm could determine support values for the subtrees of T , i.e., measures of the posterior probability that the subtrees are true.",

Specifically, a number of computational and theoretical drawbacks affect the two paradigms. The computational drawbacks mainly involve (i) the optimization aspects of the likelihood function and (ii) the sampling process in the bayesian paradigm. The theoretical drawbacks concern the evolutionary hypotheses at the core of the likelihood and bayesian criteria. As regards to the computational drawbacks, in Sect. 8.5 we have seen that finding the most likely phylogeny for a set of taxa involves maximizing a nonlinear and generally non-convex stochastic function over all the possible phylogenies in T , and for each phylogeny, over all the possible edge weights and substitution probabilities. Notoriously, this task can be only performed in an approximate way, due to a lack of general mathematical conditions that guarantee the global optimality of a solution in nonlinear non-convex programming [21, 54] . Hence, although it is possible (at least for small datasets) to enumerate all the possible phylogenies in T , it is not possible to optimize globally edge weights and the substitution probabilities of a fixed phylogeny T . This fact may affect negatively the statistical consistency of the likelihood and the bayesian paradigms. In fact, the local optima of the likelihood function grows up exponentially in function of the number of taxa considered [7, 19, 20] . Thus, fixed a phylogeny T , the global optimum of the likelihood function is generally approximated by means of hill-climbing techniques that jump from local optimum to another one until a stopping criterion is satisfied (e.g., the number of iterations performed or the elapsed time) [7, 28, 64] . Assume that two phylogenies T 1 and T 2 are given, and let 1 and 2 be two vectors whose entries are edge weights and the substitution probabilities associated to T 1 and T 2 , respectively. Let z 1 and z 2 , the likelihood values of T 1 and T 2 for 1 and 2 , respectively, and assume, without loss of generality, that z 1 > z 2 . Due to the local nature of the optima 1 and 2 , there could exists another local optimum, say O 2 , such that O z 2 > z 1 > z 2 . If the hill-climbing algorithm finds O 2 before 2 , then we will consider T 2 as a better phylogeny than T 1 , otherwise we will discard T 2 in favor of T 1 . Hence, it is easy to realize that if one of the two phylogenies is the true phylogeny, its acceptance is subordinated to the goodness of the hill-climbing algorithm used to optimize the likelihood function, and as a result the statistical consistency of the likelihood and bayesian paradigms may be seriously compromised.",

In fact, as shown in Sect. 8.5.1, the approximation of the posterior density function is generally performed by means of a MCMC algorithm (e.g., the Metropolis or the Gibbs sampling algorithm [30] ) that performs random walks in T . The random walk should be sufficiently diversified to sample potentially the whole T and avoid double backs (i.e., to sample phylogenies already visited). Unfortunately, despite the recent computational advances in the bayesian paradigm [65] , no technique may guarantee a sufficient diversification of the sampling process. Hence, the convergence to the maximum a posteriori phylogeny in practice becomes the convergence to the best-so-far a posteriori phylogeny that can be arbitrarily distinct from the true phylogeny (see [29, p. 296] ).",

For example, if a proposed model of molecular evolution matches (at least roughly) the real evolutionary process of a set of molecular data, then the likelihood and the bayesian paradigms could succeed in recovering the real phylogeny of the corresponding set of taxa (provided a solution to their computational drawbacks). However, if it is not the case, the paradigms will just provide a (sub)optimal solution for that model that may completely mismatch the real phylogeny. This aspect becomes evident e.g., in Rydin and K\u00e4llersj\u00f6 [67] 's article where, for a same dataset, two different Markov model of molecular evolution are used and two different maximum posterior phylogenies are obtained both having the 100% posterior probability of supporting the true phylogeny. concerns in general all the paradigms discussed in this chapter and possibly there is no easy solution for it.",

In fact, it is worth noting that if on one hand a strength of the bayesian paradigm is the ability to incorporate the a priori information, on the other hand this information is rarely available, hence in practical applications the prior distributions are generally modeled as uniform distributions, frustrating the potential strengths of the paradigm [1] . Moreover, it is unclear what type of information is well suited for a prior distribution; how possible conflicts among different sets of a priori information can be resolved; and if the inclusion of prior distributions strongly bias the estimation process. Huelsenbeck et al. [43] vaguely claimed \"in a typical Bayesian analysis of phylogeny, the results are likely to be rather insensitive to the prior,\" but this results was not confirmed by Yang [82] who observed that \"[...] the posterior probabilities of trees vary widely over simulated datasets [...] and can be unduly influenced by the prior [...].\" Possibly, further research efforts are needed to provide answers to these practical concerns.",

Since we are far away from a complete understanding of the complex facets of evolution, it is not generally possible to assess the superiority of a criterion over others.

Our purpose has been to introduce a classification scheme in order to provide a general framework for papers appearing in this area. In particular, three main criteria of phylogenetic estimation have been outlined, the first based on the least-squares paradigm, first proposed by Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards [15] , the second based on the minimum evolution paradigm, independently proposed by Kidd and Sgaramella-Zonta [45] and Beyer et al. [4] , and the third based on the likelihood paradigm, first proposed by Felsenstein [28] . This division has been further disaggregated into different, approximately homogeneous sub-areas, and the basic aspects of each have been pointed out. For each, also, the most relevant issues affecting their use in tackling real-world sized problems have been outlined, as have the most interesting refinements deserving further research effort.",

Selected an appropriate model of molecular evolution M , the prior distributions are then combined with the likelihood function to provide a posterior density function B.T; S; M / that represents the probability distribution of phylogenies conditional on the observed data matrix S, the model M and the priors distributions .T /, .t/, and .R/.

According to Bayes' theorem, fixed a phylogeny T i and denoted t i and R i the corresponding subspaces of edge weights and substitution probabilities, the mathematical expression of the posterior probability B.T i ; S; M / of T i can be written as: B.T i ; S; M / D L R .T i ; S; M / .T i / P T j 2T L R .T j ; S; M / .T j / ; (8.17) where .T i / denotes the prior probability of T i , and L R .T i ; S; M / denotes the integral of the likelihood function L.T i ; S; M / over all possible edge weights and substitution probabilities [41], i.e., L R .T i ; S; T i ; S; M / .t 0 / .R 0 /dt 0 dR 0 :",
