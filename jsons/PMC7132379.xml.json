            "text": "As a class of airborne pollutants \u201cBioaerosols\u201d are particulate matter usually associated with compounds of biological origin. This definition includes all pathogenic or non-pathogenic, live or dead fungi and bacteria, bacterial endotoxins, mycotoxins, peptidoglycans, \u03b2 (1, 3)-glucans, viruses, high molecular weight allergens, pollens, etc. (Douwes et al., 2003). They are ubiquities, highly variable and complex and are natural or manmade in origin. Air contains a significant number of bioaerosol particles which vary in size and composition. The majority of bioaerosols are of respirable size, namely of the order of 0.003 \u03bcm for viruses (Taylor, 1988), from 0.25 to 20 \u03bcm for bacteria (Thompson, 1981), from 17 to 58 \u03bcm for plant pollens (Stanley and Linskins, 1974), and from 1 to 30 \u03bcm for fungi (Gregory, 1973). The inhalable fractions are of primary concern as major portions of bioaerosol are susceptible to reach the deeper parts of the respiratory system. Composition mainly depends on the source, aerosolization mechanisms and environmental conditions prevailing at the site (Pillai and Ricke, 2002).",

            "text": "Two types of factors that influence the bioaerosols according to several studies are physical characteristics and environmental factors. Physical characteristics includes size, density, and shape of droplets or particles while environmental factors include the moisture content of building material, density of the air, relative humidity and temperature (Droffner et al., 1995, Foarde et al., 1993, Pasanen et al., 2000), air exchange rates (Kulmala et al., 1999), and human activities (Buttner and Stetzenbach, 1993). High average temperature and higher relative humidity favor microbiological growth on proper substratum thereby acting as a proper source of bioaerosol (Jones and Harrison, 2004). Light intensity, magnitude of air currents, wind direction and wind speed also play major roles in bioaerosol concentration and their transportation and displacement from one environment to another (Lighthart and Shaffer, 1994\n). Bioaerosols ranging in size between 1.0 and 5.0 \u03bcm generally remain in the air, whereas larger particles are shortly deposited on surfaces (Mohr, 2001). As environmental factors play a major role in bioaerosol distribution, several studies related to spatial and temporal distribution of bioaerosol have also been conducted in different parts of the world. In Beijing, China the highest airborne bacterial concentration was observed in summer and fall (Fang et al., 2007). Almost similar results were observed in Washington D.C., Montreal of Canada and Moscow, wherein bacterial concentrations were at their peak in the summer and lowest in the winter season due to regional climatic conditions (Jones and Cookson, 1983, Kelly and Pady, 1954, Vlodavets and Mats, 1958). In case of fungal bioaerosol, their distribution nature had also been studied wherein in suburban areas of Washington airborne fungal concentration was similar to bacterial concentration, i.e., the lowest in winter and the highest in summer and fall (Jones and Cookson, 1983). Similar pattern of fungal distribution was also observed in Beijing with the highest in summer and autumn and the lowest in spring and winter (Fang et al., 2007). Seasonal variability of airborne mold was conducted in single-family residence in NY with no visible water damage or leaks and wherein 15\u201340% RH and 17\u201318 \u00b0C temperature was maintained in winter while 40\u201380% RH and 22\u201328 \u00b0C temperature in summer. The study revealed that fungal levels in summer were 26 times higher in comparison to winter (LeBouf et al., 2012). Similar to the above studies, seasonal variability of airborne bacteria were conducted in the restrooms different indoor environments such as a shopping centre, hospital, subway system, public library and old and new university lecture building in Republic of Korea. Among the six locations, all five sites revealed significantly smaller bioaerosol concentration in winter than in summer except the restroom in hospital lobby which may be due to the maintenance of almost similar indoor air conditions by air conditioning system artificially in both summer and winter (Lee et al., 2012).",

Indoor upon outdoor (I/O) ratio in several studies has shown that outdoor concentration had always acted as one of the sources of bioaerosol in different indoor environments (Ghosh et al., 2013). Apart from outdoor concentration building condition, occupancy level and human activities also determine the varying concentrations of bioaerosols (Nasir and Colbeck, 2010). In fact human beings have been attributed to be one of the most important sources of airborne bacteria (Stetzenbach, 1997). Increased human shedding of skin cells and activities such as talking, coughing and sneezing force air under pressure through nose. This process ejects microbes from upper respiratory tract into the air (Terkonda, 1987). Sneezing is the most vigorous of these mechanisms, by generating as many as one million droplets lass than 0.1 \u03bcm in diameter (Campbell et al., 1991), and presence of such organic particulates in air gives added protection to bacterial cells and result in enhanced survival of the air borne microbes. Sweeping of floors and dusting of objects, movement of people and air currents also have been found leading to the suspension of dust particulates and generation of airborne microorganisms (Kallioski et al., 1996). Food stuffs, house plants, flower pots, pets and their beddings, furniture stuffing also release various fungal spores into the air (Cox and Wathes, 1995, Kalogerakis et al., 2005). According to certain studies higher level of dust and macromolecular organic components (proteins) were found in carpet dust than floor dust, hence it can be said that human movement across such a carpeted floor covering ejects trapped debris and dust into the air (Gravensen, 1987).",

During different IAQ studies it has been found that bioaerosols contribute to about 5 to 34% of indoor air pollution (Wanner et al., 1994, Srikanth et al., 2008). Hence it is an important criterion to take into account the microbiological air quality so as to provide a safe environment while designing indoor workplaces. This review provides a brief description of various sampling and analytical techniques that are generally used to characterize bioaerosols. This review also provides the information on the concentration levels of various airborne microorganisms in different indoor environments, their associated health effects as well as various bioaerosol control mechanisms worked upon till now. The objective of this review is not only to acquire knowledge about bioaerosol and their associated health effect in order to apply measures to reduce them by various controlling mechanisms, but also to find out the advantages and limitations of each sampling and enumeration technique from all the previously assembled works so as to facilitate future researchers in deciding upon the correct bioaerosol assessment protocol accordingly.",

            "text": "Impactors are economically feasible samplers due to their low costs and easiness of handling (Zollinger et al., 2006). The basic principle behind impactors is impaction that collects microorganism and particles in the air. The impaction sampler draws in air and forces to change its direction which causes particles with high inertia to get impacted over collecting surfaces (Henningson and Ahlberg, 1994). Generally particles which are larger than a particular aerodynamic size get impacted onto a collection surface forcing the smaller particles to proceed through the sampler (Hinds, 1982). A number of samplers available commercially using impaction based methods are one of the common approaches to collect bioaerosols (Gangneux, 2001, Pillai and Ricke, 2002). Impactors differ in the characteristics of inlet size and shape, number of collection \u2018chambers\u2019 within the sampler and whether the microorganisms are impacted onto a solid (glass slide) or semi-solid (agar plate) surface, or, a filter or gelatin (Macher and Hansson, 1987). Collection and recovery efficiencies of the samples are strongly influenced by the inlet characteristics of the samplers where inlet (and collection) efficiency highly depend on wind velocity at the time of sampling, and the orientation of sampler during sampling. With wind velocity above 5 ms-1 and the inlet aperture facing the wind almost 50% of overestimation of 10 \u03bcm sized particles are done while when the sampler is in an upright position (with wind blowing across the inlet aperture), less than 5% of 10 \u03bcm particles were collected (Willeke et al., 1993). It has been seen that the mass of particles smaller than cut-diameter (d50) that are generally collected are equal to the mass of particles larger than the d50 that pass through the impactor. In fact it has been found that the collection efficiency of the impaction samplers is 100% when the aerodynamic diameter is greater than d50 (Hinds, 1982). It has been seen that for the same aerosol sample which shares the same geometric standard deviation, the mass and count particle distributions will show distinctive means and medians. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) describes the mass distribution which equals the diameter where particles larger than MMAD contribute half the collected mass while those particles smaller than MMAD contribute the other half. The median of the number of particles in the particle distribution is named as count median aerodynamic diameter (CMAD). Sampling time and impaction velocity also plays a very important role in the collection and viability of the airborne collected microorganisms. At a constant time if impact velocity is increased it may cause particle bounce, decreasing the actual collection efficiency (especially for spores) and also affects the viability of stress sensitive microorganisms (Juozaitis et al., 1994).",

As seen the collection medium is that the collected micro-organisms are cultured and then counted on the plates requiring no post-sampling processing to determine the numbers of microorganisms present (except for incubation at the required temperature) (Li and Lin, 1999, Nesa et al., 2002). Disadvantage of using agar plates is of becoming over loaded by microorganisms making enumeration of the colonies difficult as they overlap and become indistinguishable from one another. A statistical \u201cpositive hole correction\u201d is thus needed to evaluate highly loaded plates (Feller, 1950, Andersen, 1958). Desiccation related problems are also associated with impaction sampling as surface moisture is removed by air stream passing over the agar plate limiting the ability to impact more particles due to reduced surface stickiness (Cox and Wathes, 1995).",

            "text": "A number of impactor samplers are commercially available each of which show differences in number of nozzles, nozzle dimension and shape, jet-to-plate distance and number of stages. When a single nozzle is used to suck in air the shape is usually rectangular as in Slit sampler (e.g., Burkard Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Hertfordshire, United Kingdom; New Brunswick Scientific Co., Edison, N.J.; Casella London Ltd). In this sampler for proper spreading out of the collected bioaerosol particles the collection surface may be moved under the slit. Such sampler has been used for both indoor and outdoor sampling of airborne microorganisms (Lal et al., 2013). Cascade impacter such as Anderson sampler (Graseby Andersen, Smyrna, GA, USA) have several stages with successively smaller nozzles such as the Six stage Anderson Sampler used to quantify both fungal and bacterial bioaerosol in different indoor environments such as hospital, student dorm, laboratory, hotel room etc., in Beijing (Xu and Yao, 2013). This allows separation of bioaerosols according to their aerodynamic diameter. MAS 100 (Merck, Germany) is one of the single stage impactors which consists of a perforated plate with 400 holes each of 0.7 mm diameter through which the collected air is aspirated either vertically or horizontally and with the speed of 10.8 ms-1 is propelled onto a solid agar plate. The sampling volume is adjusted to 100 L/m3 after passing through an airflow meter (Meir and Zingre, 2000). Consistent performance was found when MAS 100 was used for sampling Aspergillus fumigatus and other thermotolerant fungal bioaerosol (Engelhart et al., 2007).When the number of nozzles increases usually circular in shape it takes the appearance of a sieve thus forming another sampler named Sieve \u2013 type sampler (Spiral System Instruments, Bethesda, Md.). Rotorod Sampler (Ted Brown Associates, Los Altos Hills, CA) and Rotoslide sampler (Oak Ridge Reproduction Service, Oak Ridge, TN) are rotating impactors generally used for outdoor sampling collects particles larger than 15 \u03bcm (Mandal and Brandl, 2011). Sampling by such samplers are done by sweeping the collecting surface which may be a rod or a slide through the air. Fraction of particles impacted on the collecting surface from the volume of air swept by the rotating surface defines the collection efficiency of the samplers (Juozaitis et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Among all the above-mentioned impactor samplers slit sampler was specifically described for collecting airborne microorganisms long back (Bourdillon et al., 1941). This type of sampler is best applicable to monitor the effect of \u201cpeople activity\u201d as well as operational variation and material movements over the production and distribution of bioaerosol and hence have been widely used in settings such as agricultural environments that are highly contaminated (Blomquist et al., 1984) as well as in domestic environments (Verhoeff et al., 1990). For collecting large airborne particles (such as large fungal spores, clumped spores and pollen grain) slit sampler is very useful and hence had been mostly employed to determine the fungal bioaerosol in domestic settings (Kozak et al., 1980) instead of bacterial cells and small spores. As slit sampler provides information about bioburden in respect to time and activity without regarding particle size, both cascade impactor and sieve type sampler determine the particle size distribution of the bioaerosols. Cascade impactor and stacked sieve six stage Anderson viable impactor can be used to collect both bacterial and fungal spores and fragments unlike slit sampler. In case of six stage Anderson viable impactor, sampling of airborne bacterial and fungal with mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) less than 4 may result in an overloaded sample if the concentration is greater than 5000\u20137000 CFU/m3 while for the same diameter range Sieve personal sampler can be used satisfactorily for sampling (Jensen and Schafer, 1998). Hence sieve sampler seems to best fit for sampling in highly contaminated environments while Anderson sampler can be used when positive hole correction factors are used for proper calculation of the number of particles collected when overloaded (Blomquist et al., 1984, Macher, 1989). In comparison to the above-mentioned Rotorod sampler mainly helps in qualitative assessment of bioaerosols rather than quantitative (Cox and Wathes, 1995). Rotorod has been found to collect greater number of large sized airborne particles such as pollen grains instead of bioaerosol spores per unit of air (Cage et al., 1996).",

On completion of sampling the aliquots are cultivated on proper growth media to enumerate viable microorganisms. Impingers are generally needed to be sterilized before re-use. In fact replicate samples require a \u2018fresh\u2019 impinger, which increases costs of impingement based sampling than impaction-based sampling (Cartwright et al., 2009).",

Studies carried out by scientist in May (1966) revealed that at 4.5 m s\u2212 1 wind speed across the inlet, the collection efficiency turned out to be 9.6%, whereas after creating a still air condition by using a baffle, the collection efficiency jumped upto 99% (Sanchez-Monedero and Stentiford, 2003).",

As most of the impinger samplers are made up of glass they are cheaper than metal samplers such as the Andersen sampler, but affecting their robustness in the field. AGI-30 is a single stage impinger with a cylindrical reservoir under vacuum that contains a suitable collection liquid for concentrating bioaerosol from the air through a central jet raised 30 mm from the base of the cylinder. AGI-30 consists of an electrical powered pump capable of drawing 12.5 L/min at a pressure drop across the impinge jet of 50 kPA with a typical sampling time of 10\u201330 min. The AGI-30 sampler (Ace Glass Inc., N.J., USA) is a cheap but less efficient sampler (Ding and Wang, 2001). AGI-30 comes with a disadvantage of foaming that can be induced in several collection solutions through the impingement process (Dillon et al., 2005). The most popularly used sampler is \u201cBiosampler\u201d liquid impinger (SKC, Eight Four, PA, USA). This sampler is a good example of an all-glass, swirling aerosol collector. It mainly consists of an air inlet, three tangentially arranged nozzles and a collection vessel (Lin and Li, 1999). The Biosampler also consists of a pump capable of drawing in air at the same rate as that of AGI-30 but the sampling duration is very high 0.5 to 4 h. The greatest advantage of the sampler is its ability to be used in highly contaminated environment with sampling duration up to 30 min with aqueous based sampling media and up to several hours by using a viscous sampling medium (Dillon et al., 2005).",

Out of these gelatin filters offers a much better environment (Mandal and Brandl, 2011). The forces that are responsible for collection of particles are inertial forces, diffusion and electrostatic attraction (Gilbert and Duchaine, 2009). The filter method is generally used in personal samplers (such as worn by workers at relevant facilities) rather than in general sampling due to their small size. In fact filter-based samplers when used as non-personal samplers were more suitable for qualitative assessments of airborne micro-organisms only (Predicala et al., 2002). According to size fraction bioaerosol collection can be done by using polyurethane foam inserts (Kenny et al., 1998).",

Desiccation/drying off of microorganisms on the filters post collection is another problem related to filtration based samplers (Hinds, 1982). Though some microorganisms such as fungi and spore forming bacteria are sometimes found alive on the filters, vegetative bacterial cells such as Gram negative bacteria cannot tolerate the desiccation stress at all (Wang et al., 2001). In fact sampling time and relative humidity plays a major role in determining the loss incurred due to desiccation. It has been reported that when temperature exceeds 30\u00b0 celsius and relative humidity increases from 30 to 85% fungal propagules are still viable while many vegetative bacterial cells become nonviable (Wang et al., 2001). The filters when vortexed help in the recovery of bacterial cells (Douglas, 2012).",

In an electrostatic precipitation sampler the biological particles are charged at the inlet. The charged airborne biological particles are then exposed to an electrical field inside the sampler resulting in their cross sectional migration eventually depositing over charged plates. Finally from the charged plates the microorganisms are extracted and analyzed. This technique provides a much better means of collection especially for stress-sensitive microorganisms as the particle velocity component perpendicular to the collection medium is almost two to four order lower than those found in bioaerosol impactors and impingers at comparable sampling flow rate (Mainelis et al., 1999). The collection efficiency is found to be dependent on applied voltage, flow rate, dimension of the precipitators and initial particle charging level (Mainelis et al., 2001, Mainelis et al., 2002a, Mainelis et al., 2002b). By limiting the initial charge on airborne microorganism at the inlet the loss due to viability can be controlled (Mainelis et al., 2002c). Generally low power is required for maintaining the sampling flow through an electrostatic precipitator as it is an open channel. Moreover since very little power is also needed to create precipitation voltage, this method turns out to be highly feasible for low power monitoring of bioaerosol in a counter bioterrorism network.",

A recently developed electrostatic precipitator had no charging unit in the inlet while the physical collection efficiency strongly depended on the precipitation voltage which eventually depended on the charge present on the airborne microbes naturally due to aerosolization (Kunkel, 1950, Flagan, 2001) thereby making collection possible by differentiating between the positively and negatively charged microorganisms by adding a signature to the bioaerosol particle sampled (Lee et al., 2004a, Lee et al., 2004b). During the effort made for electrostatic sampler's development and evaluation, important information was found regarding the electro biological properties of microorganisms that is related to electric potential of their membrane which is further determined by the transmembrane potential between the extracellular fluid and cytoplasm, and 2 surface potentials at the external and internal interfaces of the membrane. According to the information gained bacteria that are dispersed from a liquid through pneumatic nebulization generally possess a wide and bipolar electric charge distribution. The viability of the bacteria was also found to be affected by the electric charge imposed on it during aerosolization due to removal of some fragments of bacterial surface and counter ions (Mainelis et al., 2001). Since the basic metabolic activity of the bacterial cells depend on the membrane potential (Cevc, 1990), ion transporters/channels and metabolically essential proteins, ATPase are significantly affected by this change in membrane potential (Bond and Russel, 2000) eventually making the microbes nonviable.",

In cyclone samplers microorganisms are captured into a liquid (aerosol to hydrosol) using swirling air and centrifugal force. Such samplers are advantageous as they are less susceptible to particle \u2018bounce\u2019 and re-entrainment (Willeke et al., 1998). These samplers are relatively easy to sterilize and play an important role when multiple samples are needed to be taken (Cartwright et al., 2009). Since water is used as the sampling medium in both the samplers cyclones and impingers, studies related to their efficiency was done revealing the recovery efficiency of cyclone samplers to be 100 \u00b1 10% relative to AGI-30 impinger for Gram negative bacteria (Henningson et al., 1988).",

On entering the temperature gradient the airborne particles tend to move away from the hot surface towards the cooler surface and depositing over it, a phenomenon known as thermophoretic motion (Waldmann and Schmitt, 1966).The hot surface is generally heated up to 125 \u00b0C while the other collecting surface is cooled by a circulating water heat exchanger. Immediate microscopic examination can be done is glass microscopic cover slips that are used as the cooler collection surface or if collected over filter paper from which the deposits could be transferred to agar plates to allow colonies to grow and examined thereafter (Kethley et al., 1952 and Orr et al., 1956). The collection efficiency of such sampling technique is very high for small particles ranging from < 0.01 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm, when the temperature gradient is sufficiently maintained all throughout the sampling time, and thus this method is used to determine the particle size distribution (Watson, 1958). Although its collection efficiency for smaller particles is high yet its collection rate is very low in comparison to other samplers ranging from 7 cm3\n min\u2212 1 to 1 L min\u2212 1 (Cox and Wathes, 1995). Thus because of such low rate sampling and requirements of very precise adjustments, such samples are not commonly used in industries (Kang and Frank, 1989).",

In such sampler, air is drawn in through a vacuum pump into humidifier first. The humidifier consists of a heating source that evaporates liquid source such as water (usually a biocompatible source) to create a humid environment (with relative humidity 90% or higher) to temperature higher than the room temperature i.e., 35 \u00b0C but lower than 45 \u00b0C so as to prevent the deactivation of microbes collected. The air sample is then drawn into the amplifier via vacuum action. The amplifier consists of a cooling source that eventually reduces the temperature to as low as 10 \u00b0C. Due to this low temperature the air volume in the amplifier is subjected to condensation with supersaturated vapors. Here the sampled bioaerosol acts as the condensation nuclei from which the particle grows or amplifies, however maintaining the viability of the microorganism. Particle size amplification of bioaerosols due to condensation of super saturated vapors can occur at the order of nanometer and/or submicron to a greater size such as 10 \u03bcm and above. The time period required for condensation amplification is as less as 1 s or even lesser. Thus amplification increases the bioaerosols dimensions indirectly increasing the detection efficiency. The amplified bioaerosol then can directly sent into a biomass spectroscopy system (such as MALDI-TOF) for in-line and continuous identification. Due to such technique very small bio-species/ bioaerosols such virus that cannot be sampled or detected by conventional systems can be amplified and studied upon (Wu et al., 2013).",

After the air samples are collected through impaction, the cultivated bacterial species is excited by a laser light whose wavelength that is selected is often the one at which the species has its largest cross section. Within a few nanoseconds or microseconds the species de-excite and emit light (with wavelength longer than the excitation wavelength) (Zare, 2012). This emitted fluorescent light is then recorded by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or Filtered photo diode. LIF is highly advantageous over absorption spectroscopy because the detection sensitivity is very high as the signals are observed against dark background and two to three-dimensional images can be obtained as emitted fluorescent radiation can be obtained in all possible angle (Zare, 2012). The classified fluorescent signals can be confirmed by correlating with morphology, Gram staining or family (R\u00f6sch et al., 2005). As seen in Table 2 in LIF as analysis and detection is done on the basis of emitted fluorescence light from the species, probability of improper measurement exists as all the species do not fluoresce.

In comparison to other immunological and biochemical tests identification of species by this process is highly economical and accurate (Seng et al., 2009) however as shown in Table 2 it can only analyze compounds greater than 600 Da in size such as proteins, and peptides, available in database forms due to intense matrix signal thereby restricting its identification range.",

It is a time resolved atomic emission spectroscopic analytical technique based on optical emission following pulsed laser ablation of a sample (Radziemski and Cremers, 2006, Schechter et al., 2006). In this process when the laser is focused onto a small area at the surface of the specimen, it ablates a very small amount of material (in nanograms to picograms) which generates a plasma plume with temperature in excess of 100,000 K. At such high temperature the ablated materials breakdown into excited ionic and atomic species. During this time, the plasma emits a continuum of radiation which does not contain much information about the species present which is useful. During this emission of radiation within a very small time frame the plasma expands at supersonic velocities and cools. At this point the characteristic atomic emission lines of the elements can be observed which gives the information about the specimen.",

It is important to note that LIBS analysis does not depend upon identifying the genetic differences between the species (the LIBS analysis does not rely on the elements that comprise DNA or proteins such as carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen), it is rather the difference in the inorganic chemical composition of the outer membrane that is detected. In fact the chemical composition varies between bacterial species as a function of the genetic variation between those species. In recent studies by using LIBS with both nanosecond and femtosecond laser pulses bacterium E. coli was identified (Baudelet et al., 2006, Diedrich et al., 2007). E. coli a nonsporulating Gram negative bacterium has specific outer membrane that contains Mg2 + and Ca2 + (Singleton, 1997). The ionized and neutral Mg and Ca emission lines act as the dominant spectral features in the LIBS spectrum of E. coli. Thus for a particular bacterium for creating a \u201cSpectral fingerprint\u201d, measurement of emission lines from these and other trace inorganic elements such as iron, potassium, sodium, phosphorus and manganese are done. However, there are chances of less precision of result obtained ranging from 5 to 10% depending upon excitation properties of laser, sample homogeneity and sample matrix as mentioned in Table 2.",

Moreover if it is attached with a computer based image analysis system, the counting gets automated and a high throughput of samples are achieved (Kildeso and Nielsen, 1997). However the disadvantage of this technique (as shown in Table 2) is binding of the fluorochrome to abiotic material, error in counting the microorganisms by human as well as differentiating between microbial cells and abiotic material such as dust (Pillai and Ricke, 2002). Although as mentioned before by using an image analysis automated system one can improve enumeration yet limitation still persists as it will only count particles which will fall within the size parameters of the programmer (Crook and Sherwood-Higham, 1997). Thus the overlapped cells are most likely not to be counted. In order to minimize the \u201cfalse positive\u201d results generated from binding of fluorochromes to abiotic particles Baclight Fluorescent stain can be used as this stain is less susceptible to binding to such materials in respect to acridine orange that is found to bind with humic material (Kildeso and Nielsen, 1997). Thus for enumeration of airborne microorganisms both baclight and acridine orange are used maximally (Terzieva et al., 1996).",

Depending upon the background fluorescence the data analysis software provided then calculates the cycle number CT (at which the fluorescence in the sample crosses the threshold) which is inversely correlated with the microorganisms concentration in the sample. Studies have proven that standard curves can be produced by using known microorganism concentration as templates. These standard curves can then help to quantify the total microorganism concentration in the unknown sample (Ana et al., 2006).

Again just like epifluorescence microscopy, along with the microbial cells, counting of abiotic particles having the same size as of cells is one of the limitations of this technique. The other disadvantage is that it can only count microorganisms that are found as single cells. In case of bioaerosols along with single cells aggregates of cells can also be sampled, which will then be required to be vortexed or agitated in order to break the cell clusters before analyzing using flow cytometer. This process may again lead to some other disadvantages such as affecting the viability of some of the cells present as well as increasing the cell numbers (Terzieva et al., 1996, Jensen et al., 1992).",

Metagenomic analysis involves various steps such as isolation of DNA from the required environmental sample followed by cloning of the extracted DNA into a suitable vector. Soon after that the clones are transformed into a host bacterium. The transformants are then screened such as 16S rRNA and rec A for phylogenetic markers, or for multiplex PCR (Stein et al., 1996), or for specific trait expression as for example enzyme activity (Lorenze et al., 2002), or can be randomly sequenced (Tyson et al., 2004). In recent studies \u201cshotgun\u201d is being largely used to get unbiased samples of genes from the sample community members (Eisen, 2007). Advancement in the refinement of DNA amplification as well as proliferation of computational power have helped the analysis of DNA sequences extracted from environmental samples thereby allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples. Although previously clone libraries were used yet at present cloning step is omitted due to the advancement of next generation sequencing techniques that yields greater sequencing data without labor intensive step. Thus with the help of high throughput sequencing technologies shotgun metagenomics not only provide information about the type organisms present in the environmental sample but also informs about the possible metabolic processes in the community (Segata et al., 2013). Whole genome sequencing has also been applied to study the airborne microbial community in various indoor and outdoor environments of NYC after collecting air samples using a Wet Cyclone Portable Air Sampler at the flow rate of 450 L/min (Yooseph et al., 2013).",

The throughput requirement also seems to be quite less, only one or two instruments for the completion of the experiment. The work process of next generation sequencing-ready libraries consists of a few steps. Firstly, ligation of specific adaptor oligos at both ends of the DNA fragment and hence prepared for sequencing. In NGS it is important to note that relatively very little DNA input (only a few grams at the most) is required and by using slightly modified library processes the platforms can also sequence the paired ends of the of a given fragment. Moreover in comparison to the capillary sequencers (where long read lengths of 650\u2013800 bp are produced), depending upon the platforms shorter read lengths (35\u2013250 bp) are produced by the next generation sequencers. Apart from theses generally shared features, the commercially available sequencers significantly differ from each other such as Illumina sequencing is based on \u201csequencing by synthesis\u201d i.e., SBS (Ansorge, 2009), Rocha (454) sequencing operates on the principle of \u201cpyrosequencing\u201d (Margulies et al., 2005), SoLiD sequencing (Mardis, 2008), etc. Thus as seen in Table 2 the obvious disadvantage of NGS apart from high startup cost and requirement of multiple days of run the major disadvantage is limited phylogenetic characterization capability as it works on only short read lengths (< 600 bp). The comparative metrics and performance of the above-mentioned next generation sequencers are given in Table 3\n.",

Recently, DGGE of ribosomal DNA fragment amplified by PCR has been introduced as another genetic fingerprinting technique in microbial ecology (Muyzer et al., 1993). Once the DNA fragments of multiple organisms are extracted and amplified using PCR, they are subjected to DGGE where DNA fragments of different sequences but same length are separated. In DGGE a constant heat of 60 \u00b0C and an increasing concentration of DNA denaturants i.e., mixture of urea and formamide are used to unwind the DNA molecules. Since in electrophoresis molecular weight, shape and electrical charge of DNA, RNA and proteins play the major role in the separation process (Creighton, 1999), similarly in DGGE, positive electrodes attract the negatively charged DNA fragments and are forced to migrate through the polyacrylamide gel. While moving through the gel they encounter the denaturing reagent mixture which in the presence of constant temperature breaks the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs unwining them or as termed partially melting them (Muyzer et al., 1993). The melting domains are thus determined which are eventually defined as stretch of base pairs having specific identical melting temperatures (Muyzer et al., 1993, Muyzer and Kornelia, 1998). Difference in melting temperatures due to variation of sequences within theses melting domains causes the differential migration of the sequences to different positions in the gel (Muyzer et al., 1993). Almost 50% of sequence variant up to 500 bp can be detected in DNA fragments using DGGE (Myers et al., 1985), which can be increased to almost 100% by attaching on one side of fragment a GC clamp i.e., a GC rich sequence which prevents the complete dissociation of the double stranded DNA into single stands due to high melting domain (Sheffield et al., 1989).",

However, several published values in relation to acceptable concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosol have been found that differ from country to country such as for total bioaerosol concentration in Korea and Netherlands are 800 cfu/m3 and 10,000 cfu/m3 respectively (Jo and Seo, 2005, Eduard, 2009); Fungal concentration in Brazil, Germany, Portugal and Switzerland are 750 cfu/m3, 10,000 cfu/m3, 500 cfu/m3 and 1000 cfu/m3 respectively (De Aquino Neto and de G\u00f3es Siqueira, 2004; Institut f\u00fcr Arbeitsschutz der Deutschen Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung (IFA), 2004; Pegas et al., 2010, SUVA, 2007) and bacterial concentration in Finland, Germany and Netherlands are 4500 cfu/m3, 10,000 cfu/m3 and 10,000 cfu/m3 respectively (Nev\u00e4lainen, 1989; Institut f\u00fcr Arbeitsschutz der Deutschen Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung (IFA), 2004; Eduard, 2009). Most of the guidelines are found to be in relation to specific microorganism such as Penicillium (Eduard, 2009) or specific group microorganism such as Gram negative bacteria (SUVA, 2007). Thus it is very evitable that till date no work has been done that can describe health effects solely on the basis of overall fungal or bacterial concentration present, rather many research have worked in the direction revealing that health effects are dependent on the combination of three factors namely, the genera of the airborne microbe, their size range (depicting till what level they may penetrate in the respiratory system) and their concentration in the concerned environment. This statement can be supported by the study done on 11 sawmill workers exposed to 0.2\u20131.5 \u00d7 106 fungal spores/m3 mainly of Rhizopus and Penicillium by Roponen et al., wherein a NOAEC in relation to nasal inflammation was suggested i.e., mere exposure to high microbial concentration does not evoke inflammation, rather the type of microbe or microbial product in the environment determines the potential of proinflammation of microbial exposure (Roponen et al., 2002).",

Among all the three, standard for the exposure concentration of 50 EU/m3 for endotoxin was published by Dutch Expert Committee on Occupational Standards (DECOS) in 1998 (DECOS, 1998) which was re-evaluated to 90 EU/m3 in 2010 on the basis of respiratory effects such as inflammation of airway (Samadi et al., 2013). Apart from DECOS, in Netherlands for general population an exposure limit of 30 EU/m3 was also suggested by Health Council of The Netherlands (Health-Council-of-the-Netherlands, 2012). Study carried out in several buildings of mid-western USA correlated pulmonary and respiratory problems with endotoxin levels in the indoor, some reports being as low as 1 EU/m3 (Reynolds et al., 2001). Mycotoxins, as the name suggests are secondary metabolites of fungi (fungal specific) that are highly toxic to both animal and human health. Among different mycotoxins aflatoxin B1 released from Aspergillus sp., (Bennet and Klich, 2003) have been found to cause liver cancer, hepatitis (Ross et al., 1992); deoxynivalenol released from Fusarium graminearum (Bennet and Klich, 2003) have been found to cause vomiting and nausea (Rotter et al., 1996) while Fumonisin B1 released from Fusarium nygamai (Bennet and Klich, 2003) has the ability of probable esophageal cancer in humans (Bucci et al., 1996). In comparison to mycotoxins, mvocs have always received less attention although some studies revealed mvocs associated with \u201csick building syndrome\u201d (Molhave, 2009) as well as headache, lethargy, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough and wheezing (Araki et al., 2010).

The deliberate release of pathogenic Bioaerosols has become an act of terrorism or warfare that has become a troubling possibility and a frightening reality. In 2001, Bacillus anthracis spores were mailed in envelopes in U.S. around the country and its outbreak resulted in killing 5 people, sickening 17 others, and contaminating several Senates, post, and media offices (Klietmann and Ruoff, 2001). Smallpox (Variola virus) is considered to have the greatest Bioweapon potential (Henderson, 1999). Other potential Bioweapons capable of getting released into the air include Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Brucella spp., Variola virus, and Coxiella burnetii (Atlas, 2002). Bioweapons are predicted to be the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) of the future due to many reasons for example: they are inexpensive to use, provide high probability of delivering considerable devastation and large scale panic (Henderson, 1999).",

The potential applicability of thermal energy has been studied by several researchers (Jung et al., 2009, Grinshpun et al., 2010). Bioaerosol treatment by thermal energy released from electrical heating coils is highly advantageous due to easy installation in buildings as well as low production of byproducts. Research has shown that exposure to temperature of 100\u2013140 \u00b0C for sub seconds can inactivate airborne bacteria (Lee and Lee, 2006) decrease the size of fungal bioaerosol their concentration as well as reduce the amount of (1 \u2192 3)-\u03b2-D-glucan (a key agent in bioaerosol-induced inflammatory responses) (Jung et al., 2009). Denaturation of proteins followed by damage of microorganism is also seen when exposed to very high temperature (Madigan and Martinko, 2006). Although thermal energy was used to control bioaerosol by Louis Pasteur around 150 years ago and its use continued thereafter for a longer period of time yet currently due to the need of energy conservation its use has been restricted (Lee, 2011).",

The germicidal effect of UV was found to be dependent on irradiation dosage, moisture content of the air and the movement pattern of the air along with the size of the room (Kujundzic et al., 2006, Beggs et al., 2006). Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) disinfects air by using ultraviolet light at sufficiently short wavelength between 220 and 300 nm destroying the nucleic acid of the organism leaving them unable to perform any vital cellular functions, eventually killing the microorganism (Madigan and Martinko, 2006). Several studies related to the dosage response of UVGI have been done revealing that high doses are required to inactivate fungal bioaerosol than vegetative bacterial bioaerosols (Lee, 2011). As for instance UVGI dosage of 1.6 \u00d7 104\u03bcW s/cm2 was found to be required for 2 log decrease in the concentration of fungal bioaerosol (Kujundzic et al., 2007) while 12 fold reduction in bacterial bioaerosol were seen at 290 \u03bcW sec/cm2 UVGI exposure (Lidwell, 1994). In comparison to thermal treatment UV irradiation technique utilizes very less energy along with simplified installation technique of UV lamps. Hence due its user friendliness UV lamps are usually installed and used to inactivate bioaerosols in indoor environments.",

Hence several researchers have developed filters with anti- microbial components such as iodine and other membrane breaking enzymes (Lee et al., 2008a, Eninger et al., 2008). Such anti- microbial filters are however useful for only short period of time because of its ineffectiveness caused by the accumulated dust particles over them. Hence by combining different bioaerosol control methods, hybrid methods are developed by scientists, as for example deposition of silver nanoparticles over filters rendered 99% inactivation of bacterial bioaerosol (Lee et al., 2008b) while under low relative humidity condition the death rate tolled up when exposed to high number of silver nanoparticles (Lee et al., 2010). Apart from use of silver nanoparticles over filters, integration of thermal energy and UV irradiation in a single method had also proven to enhance the inactivation and control of bioaerosols compensating the respective weakness of the constituting methods (Hwang et al., 2010).",

Moreover as potential health effects of bioaerosol are highly diverse including acute toxic effects, allergies, infections and cancer, assessment of bioaerosol is highly essential. Without detailed information about sampling and enumeration technique interpretation of exposure level is very difficult. Hence both advantages and disadvantages of all the methods should be known before deciding upon the suitable one for use. High bacterial count as well as presence of several allergenic fungal genuses in indoor environment represents a highly allergic environment. Hence apart from assessment, suitable steps are also necessary for controlling the airborne microbes.

Thus studies are needed to be carried out to provide proper exposure limits in relation to health in various indoor environments for which experimental studies upon animals could be conducted as has been used in several toxicological studies for other hazardous substances. Moreover, as seen in this review different detection methods have evolved with different limitations, thus studies can also be conducted of combining various techniques so as to overcome the limitations of each.",
