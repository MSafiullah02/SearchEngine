The study took place in the French Sentinel Network, a nationwide surveillance network of General Practitioners (GPs) representative of French GPs in terms age, location, and type of practice (urban/rural). Three virological laboratories also participated in the study. The study was planned for 5 weeks from January 25, 2010 to February 27, 2010. A subset of 150 Sentinel GPs, located in mainland France, was enrolled to collect clinical data and nasopharyngeal samples from every first patient of the week having a medical visit for influenza-like illness defined as a sudden fever of 398C or more with respiratory symptoms and myalgia. Sixty-three GPs (42%) collected 103 samples while 87 GPs (58%) did not. GPs did not differ with respect to their age, gender, urban/rural distribution, or years of inscription in the Sentinel Network. Patients included were of a similar age and had similar vaccination characteristics, but were more frequently men than influenza-like illness patients reported to the network during the study period. Sixtyone viruses were detected from 56 of 96 (58%) interpretable samples. The respiratory viruses detected most frequently were metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. This study",

This finding was attributed to the circulation of other respiratory viruses and, to a lesser extent, may have been associated with the increased propensity of patients with influenzalike illness to seek medical advice due to increased anxiety in the pandemic context. This finding was also observed for influenza-like illness incidence rates reported by the French Sentinel Network [Turbelin et al., 2009] . The Sentinel Network is a continuous epidemiological surveillance system based on General Practitioners (GPs) and has been operating since 1984 in France. It consists of a sample of 1,319 GPs throughout France, of which 200-400 participate each week in continuous surveillance [Valleron et al., 1986] . The GPs participating in the Sentinel Network are representative of the whole French GP population as regards to age, location, type (rural/ urban), and kind of practice (alone/pluridisciplinary) [Chauvin and Valleron, 1995] .",

Similar networks have been launched in other European countries, e.g., the UK, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain (www.ecdc.europe.eu).

Thus, the surveillance system could be sustained during periods when the number of cases of influenza-like illness is much higher. Although obtaining the results on the same day would be the ideal scenario, the ease of implementation and higher throughput are important factors, especially in high-volume laboratories [Raymond et al., 2009 ]. The present pilot study was not optimized to shorten the delay between collection and delivering the results to the GPs, the reason why the actual delay was 10-14 days. However, the results of the surveillance were made available the week following sample collection, notably because results were aggregated over the preceding week.",
