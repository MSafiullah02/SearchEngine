Whilst these are helpful, they neglect important multi-dimensional interactions between characteristics of communities. Using the Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper algorithm we construct an abstract representation of NUTS3 level economic data, overlaying onto it the confirmed cases of Covid-19 in England. In so doing we may understand how the disease spreads on different socio-economical dimensions. It is observed that some areas of the characteristic space have quickly raced to the highest levels of infection, while others close by in the characteristic space, do not show large infection growth. Likewise, we see patterns emerging in very different areas that command more monitoring. A strong contribution for Topological Data Analysis, and the Ball Mapper algorithm especially, in comprehending dynamic epidemic data is signposted.",

Where summary statistics speak of trends, and maps of cases help get a visual handle on the spatial scale, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) after Carlsson (2009) and particularly the Ball Mapper (BM) algorithm of D lotko (2019) can quickly highlight patterns within the characteristics of communities for policy to attend to. This short note, firstly, contributes a first look at how BM produces an abstract two dimensional representation of NUTS3 data and how, by doing so, we can see where in the characteristic space cases are particularly fast rising in terms of number of infections. Whilst regional characteristics are comparatively static, the changing nature of cases facilitates the envisioning of changing outcomes on the point cloud. A second contribution is thus to show how the relative levels of Covid-19 are changing within the space. Moreover we bring to the empirical economics literature an approach that recognises the outcomes we study do not manifest linearly through space as our models may present, nor are they organised neatly along axes. Interactions matter, location in the space is important, and visualising the true picture from our data is the only way to see and quantify what is truly there.",

            "text": "Intuition for the BM plot is as straightforward as the wealth of information we would gain from seeing a two-dimensional scatter plot of two characteristics. The BM technique allows us to visualize multiple dimensional data sets represented in the form of point clouds. Having this helps to understand where the considered activity, in this case the infection spread, is most prevalent. As an observation has a coordinate on a scatter plot so it is a point in this multi-dimensional cloud. Where regions in that cloud have high incidences of Covid-19 so attention must focus on the combination of each characteristic that is associated therewith; just as we would look at whether high incidences were top left, top right, etc. in a scatter plot. The dynamics are thus quickly viewed and trends therein exposited. Adda (2016) speaks much to the present situation with Covid-19, placing the spread of epidemics firmly within a world of increased transportation and trade. The high frequency use of influenza data in Adda (2016) aids economists in understanding how economic conditions link to disease spread, engaging a discussion with epidemiology. This contribution to the literature owes much to the pioneering work in combining high, and low, frequency data to marry annually updated regional characteristics with the daily information on Covid-19 cases. Obtaining data at a sufficiently micro level for study in the UK presents its own challenges, met in this paper by the use of NUTS3 level data 1 . A strong focus in the discussion of economics and disease spread is placed on employment, following works on influenza by Markowitz et al. (2019) and Eichenbaum et al. (2020) . Likewise there are considerations of income, working patterns and population age that can help understand spread (B\u00f6ckerman et al., 2009; Barnay, 2016) . Population density is a natural key to contamination rates also and must be included (Jones et al., 2008) . Familiarity with what propagates the spread of common flu viruses gives strong guidance to what may then drive the spread of Covid-19. This paper maps the characteristics space for UK NUTS3 regions to the extent of available data.",

Unlike the \"black box\" nature of non-linear and deep-learner models, the BM approach here is simply a representation of the data that the user interprets. There is also much to remind of other visualisation methods, such as t-SNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008) as endorsed recently in medical analysis by Linderman et al. (2019) , and the original TDA mapper algorithm of Singh et al. (2007) . Unlike these approaches BM does not require the construction of a full distance matrix between points as t-SNE does, and is more stable than the original mapper as BM has just one parameter and no functional choices. Consequently the insight gained into economics and the spread of disease from this paper have full transparency. In what follows we take the learning from past studies of disease spread, the methodological advancements of TDA and BM and explore what we may learn from the evolving English picture.",

Cases of Covid-19 by local authority are reported by the UK government and are as collated for researchers on the Github site of Tom White 2 . Matching from local authority to NUTS3 is performed using the look up queries from the Office for National Statistics, supplemented by some manual work on cases where no match can be found. Because of the nature of reporting, the data used here only considers England. Summary statistics for the variables used are provided in Table 1 , with the six characteristics of the point cloud showing very different scales. To overcome the challenge of having one dominant axis, the axes of the dataset are normalised into the interval [0, 1] so that the maximal value of each column gets mapped to 1, the minimal value gets mapped to 0, and all the intermediate values are mapped inbetween. In this paper raw values of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Value Added (GVA) are used as our aim is to distinguish tangibly between regions. Employing the logscaling would create greater spread lower down the distribution, meaning more balls at the lower income level, but would equally connect very different high income areas at the top of the scale. Average hours worked do not vary greatly but we do see a large regional income disparity; such is well studied for the United Kingdom. Because this is economic data, appeal is made to the geographic imbalance of the United Kingdom when considering spatial extents; weighting of GDP and wages towards London means they serve to capture much of the geography of the spread. Likewise on a micro scale the movement away from regional economic centres like Manchester, Bristol or Newcastle conveys a similar spatial extent.",

The BM graph is constructed using the six characteristics of the NUTS3 regions shown in Table 1 , recalling that these are normalised onto the interval [0, 1] owing to the varying scales of the different regional economic measures. In choosing the radius for the balls we considered carefully the trade-off between noise in the colouration and being able to chart neatly the dynamics of the cases. Colouration of the balls is a three step process. Firstly the average number of cases on a given day within the ball is calculated. This number is then divided by the sum of cases for all balls at that day. That gives a proportion of the cases within the considered ball to all cases at the given day. Note that this is done in this way because points appear in multiple balls where they sit in the intersection. The resulting variable is then passed back to the BM graph which is subsequently plotted. Altering the colouration in this way reminds that the total number of cases is increasing every day and ensures the balls only show the relative position. The alternative of calculating the new cases is liable to be volatile, high infection areas may report low cases on one day and appear lower risk for example. Hence using our adjustment allows the continued charting of dynamics. Figure 1 shows four plots which chart the changing picture of Covid-19 cases in England. These BM graphs are drawn with six axes and demonstrate a broad connectivity between most regions of England. However there are a series of balls which do not connect at this value of . These include those areas with particularly low population density, coloured red as they have a low number of cases, and those with particularly high earnings such as the combined region of Hammersmith, Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, coloured purple. Indeed Ball 20, which represents this NUTS3 area is the highest in three of the four plots. Panels (b) to (d) show a broad consistency in the relative proportion of cases in each ball. By the time we reach 3rd April, panel (a) shows the dominance of ball 20 starts to break, with more blues emerging and a general move into the orange across the plot. What we see in panel (d) is a much more even distribution of the cases of the space. Since information about the NUTS3 areas within each ball is known we can quickly check the implications of the transmission. Whilst these new hotspots have similar population densities, median ages, GDP, GVA and hours worked there is notable differential in the average pay. It is the large differential in pay that leaves ball 20 disconnected from the space. From a socio-economic standpoint this transition into the hotspots being in areas of lower wage will be noteworthy in informing the policy response.",

Figure 2 offers such a plot with one panel for each of the six axes. Panel (a) shows that it is the balls to the lower right of the main shape that have the highest population density, but the colouration of these is very mixed, the right-most set are where the numbers of cases increase notably but the left set do not see any increase at all. This suggests further confounding factors at play. Panel (b) may offer an explanation as those regions with the higher median age do correlate neatly with the ones that have the lowest reported number of Covid-19 cases. GDP and GVA, panels (c) and (d) are similar across the connected shapes as we know it is these two variables that drive the separation of the outlier balls. Likewise there is some similarity in gross pay, panel (f), though there we do witness differentiation between higher rates to the lower right and low rates at the top left. Hours worked do vary greatly with some correlation suggested there with Covid-19 cases.",

The most obvious case being balls 24 and 1. The former is predominantly districts of Outer London, whilst the latter is smaller cities such as Peterborough, Swindon, Hartlepool and the Thames Gateway. Connection between the two balls comes from Milton Keynes lying at the intersection. With the exception of Hartlepool, these are places which would see strong commuter links to London and yet the contrast with the balls that contain London is stark. Similar movement towards blue is seen in ball 27, which also contains London boroughs. There is a second interest at the other end of the connected shape where we see balls 9 and 14 become more yellow. This is not taking them to the same scale as the highest set, but it is evidence that there are non-uniform changes in other parts of the shape. These balls are the industrial north, including North-East Manchester, Blackburn and Darwen, Bradford and Sheffield. They are not major urban centres, and their overall population density is relatively low compared to other build up areas. Whether this transition is indicative of a growing cluster is unknown, but such changes are something which authorities may wish to monitor as more data comes in. The cities of Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Birmingham and Bristol sit in ball 7, this lies between the major growth balls and balls 9 and 14. A suggestion is made that these serve as a conduit to their satellites, but ball 8 that has characteristics between the two, does not show such change in early April. As time has gone on we see distinct increases in the relative proportions through ball 8 into balls 9 and 14. The latter remain ahead of their neighbours. Our dynamic plots help greatly in charting change.",

The BM algorithm has been employed to represent the economic characteristic space. We have done so across six key axes, giving a mapping of the importance of interactions of these characteristics in determining outbreak extents. Developments in Outer London, and particularly the contrast with relatively similar areas which serve London as commuter towns, will be of interest in modelling the spread. Likewise, the growing intensity seen in the North of England, in the industrial heartlands of Lancashire and Yorkshire, will also be something for further thought for UK policy-makers. Development of the dataset, fine graining the information to better represent target populations and understanding more economic variables, will all help enhance the modelling. A further omission is the spatial dimension, there is no measure here to capture the physical geography; rather we simply appeal to the idea that many of our measures are driven by the distance to London because of the economic imbalance of the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding these concerns, the goal of this paper has been a demonstration of what BM can do and inspire the growth of its use. Our dynamic evaluation is constantly updating, and as more is learned so the narrative takes shape. Extending to other countries where localised reporting of cases is available offers a rich seam for impact generating exploration. Important steps are taken in both opening new perspectives to statistical studies in economics, but also in appreciating the spread of disease across socio-economic space.",

The legend in the top left of the plot details. We see how progressively balls 22, then 24, then 27 have recorded more cases than ball 20. The London boroughs are thus gaining more cases than the original hotspot of Hammersmith and Fulham & Kensington and Chelsea. A strong increase in recent days in Ball 1 is picked up towards the lower panel, interestingly occurring a week after the lockdown became effective on March 23rd. Through April the clear flattening of the curve in ball 20 can be seen but the other curves show limited evidence of flattening.",
