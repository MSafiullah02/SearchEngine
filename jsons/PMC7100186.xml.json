The biosynthesis of these glycan chains takes place mostly in compartments of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway, in stepwise reactions involving specific nucleotide sugar transporters, glycosyltransferases, glycosidases and other glycan-modifying enzymes.1, 2 Expression of some of these gene products is altered in embryogenesis, cancer, injury and inflammation, resulting in altered glycan patterns. Sialic acids (sias) are typically the outermost monosaccharide units on the glycan chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins (Figure 1a) and are often part of recognition sites to which pathogens attach.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 On the other hand, they also serve important intrinsic functions and are required for normal development.10, 11 This brief review focuses on the many ways in which Sias can present themselves on cell surfaces, some examples from our own work of the resulting implications for normal biology and disease, and some immunohistological tools used to detect this diversity in situ.",

            "text": "Perhaps the earliest discovered \u2018function\u2019 of Sias was to serve as a receptor for the influenza A and B viruses (Figure 1c).14, 15 Most influenza viruses that infect and spread among wild and domesticated birds preferentially recognize Sias that are \u03b12-3-linked to the underlying glycan chains (the most recent example being the H5N1 \u2018bird flu\u2019 virus). Humans are resistant to infection by such viruses at least partly because we instead display \u03b12-6-linked Sias on the epithelium of upper airways (see Figure 2a). Thus, in order for avian influenza viruses to become human pathogens, certain specific mutations must occur in the Sia-binding pocket of the virus hemagglutinin. This is thought to occur in intermediate hosts such as the pig, which has both \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 linked Sias on its airways.14 However, there has been at least one instance (the 1918 influenza pandemic) wherein the virus adjusted to bind both types of linkages16, 17 and \u2018jumped\u2019 directly from birds into humans. Recent infections of a few humans with the bird flu have fortunately been traced not to such a change in virus-binding specificity, but likely exposure to a very large dose, which reached the lower airways and bound to \u03b12-3-linked Sias present at that location.15 This can also explain why these patients did not easily pass on their infections to other humans.",

We have found that the differential susceptibility of humans and chimpanzees to P. falciparum and P. reichnowii malarial parasites, respectively, might be explained by the differential preference of the parasite-binding proteins for human and nonhuman Sias.20 Thus, the change in Sias associated with human evolution (see below) was likely characterized by a phase in which our ancestors escaped from the common malaria of apes, only to later become the target for P. falciparum, which prefers the human Sia phenotype.",

Tumor emboli and microthrombi result when carcinoma selectin ligands on hematogenously borne carcinoma cells interact with selectins on platelets, innate immune cells and endothelium, serving to propagate metastases.28, 29 The serendipitous finding that some clinically approved heparins can block many of these selectin-mediated processes at clinically acceptable levels might explain why heparins reduce the incidence of metastasis, when utilized during the \u2018window of therapeutic opportunity\u2019.28, 29, 30",

Combined with modern techniques of genomics and glycomics, the various tools that have been developed for the detection of the Sias in situ can reveal much about the roles of Sias in normal and pathological states. The future is bright for these and other aspects of sialobiology, and those with an interest in training in investigative pathology are urged to take advantage of these opportunities.",

Sias are typically found at the terminal position of N- and O-linked glycans attached to the cell surface and to secreted glycoproteins, as well as on glycosphingolipids expressed at the cell surface. Ac, O-acetyl ester; Fuc, fucose; Gal, galactose; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; Glc, glucose; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Man, mannose; S, sulfate ester. Reproduced with permission from Varki.11 (b) Structural diversity. All Sias share the common feature of having nine carbons, a carboxylic acid residue at the 1-position, and a variety of linkages to the underlying sugar chain from the 2-position. Various types of substitutions at the 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 positions combine with the linkage variation to generate the diversity of Sias found in nature. Only a portion of this diversity is represented here. Some examples of the binding specificity of probes for detection of Sia types and linkages are discussed in the Box 1. (c) Examples of pathobiological interactions involving Sias. This cartoon shows examples of the types of interactions involving recognition of Sia diversity. The molecules and cells are obviously not drawn to scale.",

(a) Differential display of \u03b12-6-linked Sias on the ciliary border of lung bronchial epithelial cells in humans and chimpanzees. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and blocked for endogenous biotin and overlaid with biotinylated Sambucus Nigra agglutinin (SNA), followed by Tris-buffered saline washes, alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin and additional washes. Color detection used a Vector Labs blue substrate and nuclear fast red counterstain. Arrows point to the epithelial luminal edge, where staining is seen in humans, but not in chimpanzees or in other great apes.18 (b) Expression of 9-O-acetylated Sias in rat liver. Left panel: DFP-treated recombinant soluble influenza C Hemagglutinin-esterase (CHE-FcD). Right panel: non-DFP-treated version of the same probe (CHE-Fc, esterase active, negative binding control).19 Frozen sections of rat liver were blocked for endogenous peroxidases, fixed in formalin, washed, overlaid with the CHE-FcD or Che-Fc probes, which were pre-complexed with HRP anti-human antibodies at predetermined dilutions. After incubation at 4\u00b0C for 2 h, sections were washed in PBS and color developed using the AEC substrate with Mayer's hematoxylin for nuclear counterstain. (c) Detection of the nonhuman Sia Neu5Gc in human tumors, using an affinity-purified chicken IgY antibody. Left Panel: example of positive colon carcinoma. Frozen sections of a human colon carcinoma were blocked for endogenous peroxidases, fixed in formalin, washed and overlaid with a chicken anti-Neu5Gc antibody.38 Following washes and incubation with HRP-labeled donkey anti-chicken antibody and further washes, color was developed using the AEC substrate with Mayer's hematoxylin for nuclear counterstain. The right panel shows a negative control using a nonspecific chicken IgY. (d) Detection of GD3 and de-N-acetylated GD3 in human melanomas. Left Panel: detection of GD3 using MAb R24. Right Panel: detection of de-N-acetyl-GD3 using MAb SGR37. Unfixed frozen sections of a human melanoma were blocked for endogenous peroxidases and overlaid with monoclonal antibodies R24 or SGR37.33 Following PBS washes, incubation with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig antibodies and further washes, color was developed using the AEC substrate with Mayer's hematoxylin for nuclear counterstain.
