Studies have shown that countries conducting wildlife pathogen surveillance are more likely to understand the disease dynamics within their borders and thereby may be better equipped to limit the risk of pathogen spillover across wildlife, domestic animal, and human populations [8,9]. A prominent example was the monitoring of wild bird populations in order to investigate the transmission of avian influenza viral subtypes across species [10].

Two PREDICT countries did not submit completed surveys and three PREDICT countries were not included because they were just beginning or ending their programmatic activities at the time of the survey. For each participating country, a lead PREDICT project scientist with veterinary training and wildlife expertise was encouraged to complete the survey using individual knowledge and local resources regarding conditions observed in-country. Following completion of their portion of the survey tool, each project scientist was then asked to interview at least one wildlife official within their country for completion of the stakeholder portion of the rapid survey tool.",

In Latin America, a higher percentage (p < 0.015) of wildlife officials (86%) indicated that shared water sources were an important interface for conducting surveillance for zoonotic pathogens in wildlife compared to project scientists (0%). In Asia, a significantly higher (p < 0.007) percentage of wildlife officials (100%) indicated the areas where wildlife were butchered were an important interface compared to project scientists (20%). No statistically significant differences were observed between stakeholder groups in Africa. To further understand where greater local capacity building efforts were needed, the percentage of high priority interfaces, where PREDICT activities were focused, was evaluated. The majority (93%) of country teams were working in greater than 50% of the high priority interfaces. Additionally, 20%, 25%, and 43% of country teams in Asian, Latin American, and African countries, respectively were working in 100% of their high priority interfaces.Lack of sustainable funding and/or resources was the greatest challenge associated with conducting wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens, as identified by both the wildlife official (96%) and project scientist groups (81%) (Figure 1). However, there was no agreement in the ranking of the other important challenges identified by both stakeholder groups. The second most important challenge as identified by project scientists was insufficient laboratory capacity (63%), whereas the second most important challenge identified by wildlife officials was the lack of existing government wildlife surveillance programs or wildlife policies (91%). When examined by global region, lack of sustainable funding was the challenge identified by most officials in all three areas (Latin America: 86%; Asia: 100%; Africa: 100%). Lack of existing government wildlife surveillance programs or wildlife policies and insufficient communication or coordination among agencies, sectors, or regions were also identified as important by at least 75% of wildlife officials in all three regions. When examining the differences between the two stakeholder groups, a significantly higher number (p < 0.007) of wildlife officials (86%) thought that insufficient human capacity (i.e. trained personnel) was a major challenge for effectively conducting wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens compared to project scientists (44%). Statistically significant differences between the two stakeholder groups were also observed with ranking the challenges of insufficient communication or coordination (wildlife officials: 86%, project scientists: 56%, p < 0.044), limited interest/awareness regarding wildlife disease (wildlife officials: 77%; project scientists: 38%, p < 0.013) and cultural acceptability in conducting wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens (wildlife officials: 41%; project scientists: 6%, p < 0.018). Overall for each challenge, a larger percentage of wildlife officials identified the descriptors as important when compared to project scientists.The top opportunity important for improving wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens identified by wildlife officials was increasing communication or coordination among agencies, sectors, or regions (100%) (Figure 2). However, the most important opportunities identified by project scientists were increasing human capacity, increasing laboratory capacity, and the growing interest or awareness regarding wildlife disease or surveillance programs (all 69%). Opportunities for capacity building in wildlife pathogen surveillance identified as important by at least 75% of wildlife officials were explored by region. Seven opportunities for conducting wildlife surveillance were identified in all three regions, which included increasing funding (96%), increasing human capacity (96%), increasing laboratory capacity from new/existing programs and facilities (82%), building on existing surveillance networks/programs (91%), collaboration with local/foreign programs or organizations (96%), growing interest or awareness regarding wildlife diseases or surveillance programs (96%), and increasing communication or coordination among agencies, sectors or regions (100%).

In a study examining global trends in emerging infectious diseases from 1940 to 2004, researchers found that the global resources needed to counteract disease emergence were disproportionately focused in regions where emerging disease events were least likely to originate, such as in the developed nations of Europe, North America, Australia, and parts of Asia [7]. Due to factors such as globalization and urbanization, diseases that emerge in once isolated areas now have the ability to cause global health crises [11]. This interconnectivity highlights the fact that any surveillance gaps at the individual country level can affect global health. Recognizing this disparity across countries, numerous efforts to build and strengthen the capacity for disease detection and response in these \u2018hot spots\u2019 \u2013 regions identified as likely for the emergence of novel pathogens from wildlife that affect human health \u2013 were undertaken [12]. The PREDICT project, along with partner organizations in over 20 developing countries, specifically concentrated on preventing future pandemics at potential sources through the promotion of increased capacity, enhanced surveillance programs in wildlife, and a better understanding of the drivers associated with emerging health threats [13]. This study, conducted by PREDICT\u2019s capacity tracking team, was just one area of focus in the larger effort for global pandemic surveillance, prediction, and prevention.",

The wildlife official and project scientist groups both indicated the importance of working at key human-animal interfaces, such as the hunting locations, markets, wildlife near dwellings, wildlife-livestock interaction, captive wildlife, and extraction areas. Discrepancies across stakeholder groups regarding the relative importance of other interfaces could have been due to differences seen in each organization\u2019s current focus or limitations in each individual\u2019s area of expertise. However, gaps in program presence at interfaces that were labeled as important by wildlife officials, such as areas where wildlife were butchered, shared water sources, and land use change, remain a key focus for program improvement and stakeholder education. It is essential to note that wildlife officials were not required to rank the relative importance of the interfaces, and thus could identify as many choices as \u2018important\u2019 as they thought appropriate. While the instructions to the project scientists were no different, the nature of their work required the prioritization and ranking of the relative importance of interfaces on a daily basis to decide how their financial and time resources would be spent. Therefore, project scientists were more likely to have a larger spread in their rankings across categories than wildlife officials.",

However, different opportunities for improving wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens were identified between the stakeholder groups. This could be due to the fact that most project scientists were representatives from non-governmental organizations or universities, whereas the wildlife officials were from governmental organizations, and as such, the opportunities familiar to the individuals within their respective organizations were likely specific to the chances to improve capacity provided to them within their organizational framework. Discovering ways to collaborate and capitalize on these opportunities across sectors is an important step in building successful wildlife pathogen surveillance programs in each country. Additionally, the fact that knowledge of outbreaks potentially originating in wildlife varied by global region suggests that there was a lack of sufficient communication across stakeholder groups and that there is a need to raise awareness among stakeholders on wildlife health issues in relation to public health.",

Given limited resources, it was not surprising that all human-wildlife interfaces could not be addressed in the initial PREDICT surveillance program. For example, shared water sources were a lower priority for surveillance because they represented primarily indirect opportunities for zoonotic pathogen transmission given the dynamics at play where humans and animals often utilize water sources at different times. On the other hand, areas where there were more direct interactions between wildlife and humans, and thus a greater potential for pathogen transmission, were targeted more often (e.g. markets). Opportunities, such as a growing interest or awareness regarding wildlife disease or surveillance programs, could be used a starting point to obtain the funding needed to increase both human and laboratory capacity for wildlife pathogen surveillance.",

It was recognized that the interfaces, challenges, and opportunities listed were subjective, and there was often overlap among categories. However, the options given at the time of the survey represented the main themes encountered in wildlife surveillance. The survey also concentrated on the zoonotic transmission of pathogens at key human-animal interfaces and did not specifically focus on other pathogen transmission routes in ecosystems which are extremely important from a One Health perspective, such as anthroponoses and pathogens solely transmitted in non-human animals. Furthermore, this study consisted of a convenience sample of a limited number of wildlife officials chosen by the project scientists. The limited sample size restricted the generalizations that could be made beyond participating countries. However, similarities on the importance of the interfaces, associated challenges, and opportunities for conducting zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife would likely be seen across global regions.",

However, the results still showed important differences even at the regional level, suggesting that different global regions may have unique issues that could relate to specific human-animal interactions in that region or to the varying level of infrastructure and development by region, for example the fact that the Latin America region is considered more developed than the Asia and Africa regions may present different challenges and opportunities for wildlife surveillance. The rankings were derived from survey responses that indicated whether a stakeholder thought the priority interfaces, challenges, or opportunities were important to wildlife pathogen surveillance in his or her country specifically; therefore, it would be difficult to determine if a negative response was an indication that the descriptor was not applicable to the country, or if it was just simply not considered to be important by the respondent.",
