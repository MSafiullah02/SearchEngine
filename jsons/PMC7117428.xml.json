Subsequently, the infection spread slowly among Danish swine herds, and in 1996 the herd prevalence was about 30% (Mortensen and Strandbygaard, 1996). From mid-October 1996, there was a sudden increase in the number of samples (foetuses, weakborn and stillborn piglets) submitted to the Danish Veterinary Institute for Virus Research (DVIVR) for PRRS virus (PRRSV) examination. The samples originated from herds with acute PRRS-like clinical signs, characterised by increased numbers of late term abortions and stillborn piglets, and increased mortality in the nursing period (B\u00f8tner et al., 1997). In the vast majority of these herds, the appearance of the clinical problems coincided with recent vaccination using the attenuated live \u201cIngelvac\u00ae PRRS MLV\u201d vaccine (Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, MO, USA) which is based on the pathogenic American PRRSV field isolate, VR-2332 (Chladek et al., 1995).",

This was the first time that American type PRRSV had been isolated from clinical cases in Denmark, and this was epidemiologically closely linked to the use of the live vaccine (B\u00f8tner, 1998a, Mortensen, 2000).

Many of these herds also experienced acute PRRS-like symptoms (B\u00f8tner et al., 1997), and American type PRRSV was isolated from foetuses/stillborn piglets from more than 50 of these herds (B\u00f8tner, 1998a, B\u00f8tner, 1998b).",

The absence of infectious virus in these foetuses most probably reflects a destruction of virus caused by the autolysis, as also suggested by Christianson et al. (1992). That almost all piglets were found to be viremic at 10 days of age, was probably due to a horizontal transmission of virus from in utero infected pigs to non-infected litter-mates during the early period of life, as also described by Mengeling et al. (1998).",

This has raised the question as to whether the observed clinical symptoms were caused by the vaccine virus or by other pathogens. The present study, however, provides strong evidence that the problems were primarily the result of infection with the PRRS-VDV. The sporadic bacteriological findings did not indicate a primary role of bacteria. However, especially the pathogenic bacteria, e.g. staphylococci, found in some of the principal piglets may very well have played a secondary role in the development and severity of actual disease in individual animals. Furthermore, the fact that none of the sows seroconverted to any other viruses, and that attempts to isolate other viruses than PRRS-VDV remained negative, strongly indicated that no other viruses than PRRSV were involved. Finally, differentiating RT-PCR performed on both the original isolate, the virus inoculum itself, and on serum from two principal piglets excluded any role of European type PRRSV.",

            "text": "Having excluded the role of other infections, it was of interest to consider why problems associated with the use of the live PRRSV vaccine were so pronounced in Denmark. We suggest that a number of unique circumstances existed regarding the use of the live PRRSV vaccine in Denmark, as outlined in the following: (i) No North American wild type of PRRSV was present in Denmark, so the spread of the vaccine virus was easy to monitor. (ii) The vaccine was used solely in piglets in herds seropositive towards European type of PRRSV, and with the majority of the herds having no or minor clinical PRRSV-associated problems at the time of vaccination. (iii) The simultaneous (within few months) use of the vaccine in more than 1100 herds made it much easier to detect vaccine reversion. (iv) Due to the coordinated vaccination-program, the vaccinating herds were followed very closely. (v) In Denmark, a serological test differentiating between European and American strains of PRRSV is routinely used. In summary, the situation in Denmark made it very simple to observe vaccine reversion. In contrast, due to the reasons given above, vaccine reversion might go unnoticed in other countries. In fact, studies from American laboratories are increasingly beginning to quote vaccine reversion as the cause of clinical problems (reviewed by Meng (2000)).",

            "text": "Recently, another study describing the experimental inoculation of pregnant sows with a putative vaccine virus revertant has been published (Allende et al., 2000). That particular isolate (16244B) had 212 nucleotide substitutions when compared to the vaccine virus (Allende et al., 2000) and produced reproductive disorders comparable to those caused by the VR-2332 isolate parental to the vaccine virus (Christianson et al., 1992). Compared to the present results, Allende et al. (2000) observed a more pronounced clinical effect after infection of pregnant sows at 90 days of gestation with the 16244B isolate. Thus, these authors found a reduced level of liveborn pigs (57% in contrast to 77% in our study) with a parallel increase of stillborn pigs (43% in contrast to 23% in our study). Furthermore, the rate of survival at 10 days after farrowing was much lower (29%) than in the present study (80%). The present PRRS-VDV isolate which was collected approximately 6 months after the introduction of the vaccine into Denmark had only 63 nucleotide differences when compared to the vaccine virus (Nielsen et al., 2001). This higher level of sequence identity to the attenuated vaccine virus may explain the apparently reduced mortality when compared to the 16244B isolate, and may indicate \u2014 as also speculated by others (Mengeling et al., 1999) \u2014 that the genetic reversion to virulence happens gradually with prolonged time of passage of the vaccine virus in the field.",
