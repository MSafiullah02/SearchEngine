Ivanovsky, a Russian scientist in 1892, marking the beginning of the science of 'virology', the fascinating field of virology has progressed and benefitted mankind globally. Subsequent to the isolation of the first plant virus, namely, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the first animal virus -foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus -was reported in 1897 by Loeffler and Frosch (1898) . The virus aetiology of yellow fever in humans was established in 1900 by Walter Reed (Reed et al. 1901) . In India, animal virology started around 1900 with research work on rinderpest (cattle plague) at the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Mukteswar (now Indian Veterinary Research Institute), Izatnagar/ Mukteswar. One of the most important achievements for Indian animal virologists was the development of vaccines that proved efficient and safe. These were used for rinderpest and African horse sickness (AHS) eradication programmes (Yadav 2011; Yadav et al. 2016 ) and control of important viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases of livestock and poultry.",

The term 'epidemiology' originated in the last part of the nineteenth century from the Greek word 'epid\u0113mia', meaning 'the knowledge of the prevalence of disease'. Different definitions have been coined for 'epidemiology'. The simplest definition describes epidemiology as 'the scientific study of the spread and control of disease in populations'. In other definitions, it has been described as the 'branch of medicine which deals with the incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to health' or 'the study and analysis of the distribution and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations'. Epidemiology has been classified as descriptive epidemiology, analytical epidemiology, spatial epidemiology, landscape epidemiology, temporal epidemiology, local and global epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and applied epidemiology. The data collected on the epidemiology of important livestock diseases is of immense use in formulating appropriate disease control and management strategies.",

New proteomic approaches including T-cell and B-cell epitope mapping have given a boost to the pace to discover antigen-antibody relationships, thus giving a push to the development of newer diagnostics and vaccines for infectious diseases. Innovations in genomic technologies have paved the way for unravelling interactions between the microorganisms and cells of the innate immune system. The advent of molecular techniques in recent decades has made visible impact on the study of the epidemiology and resultant boost to the understanding of disease dynamics, aetiology, diagnosis and charting of suitable control measures at faster speed. A large number of molecular techniques have been developed and used to address epidemiological concerns. Different techniques are now available for different aspects of investigations (Joshi et al. 2013) . At the core of 'molecular epidemiology' is the need for high accuracy and specificity in typing the disease-causing agents; to monitor the spread of pathogens in populations and different species and regions; to trace back the original source of the causal agent; to study variations in the antigenicity, pathogenicity and immunogenicity; to differentiate between enzootic and panzootic infections; to discern the mode of transmission of the causative viral agent from host to host; and to sense the existence of strain variants in the vulnerable population and/or individual, besides addressing other epidemiological parameters and issues Singh et al. 2017) . Availability of newer innovative molecular technologies in recent years has revolutionized the study of patho-immunobiology and understanding the disease dynamics, leading to better diagnostics and vaccines. Molecular subtyping, being more discriminating, is considered to be better than most of the phenotypic subtyping methods as it is least influenced by the organism's responses to environmental factors.",

In the last 40 years, the world has witnessed the emergence of a number of new viral diseases in animals, humans and plants in various parts of the world with more severe consequences due to ecological, demographic and climatic changes. While about 60% of the infections are zoonotic, 75% of new viral diseases reported during the last three decades are zoonoses, i.e. transmissible between animals and humans. Interplay of host, pathogen and environment-related factors in the epidemiology of diseases justifies to cover viral and other infections under the 'One World, One Health' umbrella. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of the viral aetiologies allows better selection and adoption of appropriate and timely management practices including prophylactic vaccination of the susceptible population or therapeutic vaccination in the affected livestock population. Therefore, development/standardization of diagnostic techniques which are reliable, time-efficient, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and feasible under field conditions is of utmost importance for prevention, control, eradication, monitoring and forecasting of infectious and contagious diseases .

To name a few, these have an edge in the area of detecting infectious agents, tumours, intracellular and tissue imaging, immunohistochemistry, multiplexed diagnostics and fluoroimmunoassays. The increasing use of quantum dots, decorated gold nanospheres and nanoshells, nanobarcodes and nanobiosensors in the field of diagnostics is quickly taking over diagnostic techniques of the past as these provide accurate, faster and sensitive monitoring and surveillance tools and intensify network approaches assisting greatly in formulating effective disease prevention and control strategies.

Livestock rearing is central to the livelihoods and nutritional security of millions of small and marginal farmers and landless agricultural labours across the country. India is blessed with rich livestock resources with diverse species, breeds and strains and impressive production performance. It has the world's largest bovine dairy herd of around 300 million comprising of cows and buffaloes and stands first in milk production globally since about two decades (1998 onwards). Among the many areas of concern that limit the realization of the full potential of the livestock sector, the rising and unescapable outbreaks of viral diseases among animals are posing considerable challenges to livestock health and production. Although exact estimates due to various viral diseases to livestock industry are not available due to inadequate reporting of the disease outbreaks, the viral diseases are most important as they cause heavy economic losses through morbidity, mortality and other direct and indirect costs on treatment, hygiene, disinfection and sanitary measures; loss in production, reproduction and working capacity of animal; and replacement costs of stock. Unlike bacterial, fungal, parasitic and mycoplasma diseases, non-availability of cost-effective antiviral drug therapy, rapid spread, etc., make the task of their control more difficult.",

The infection and death rates in newly exposed na\u00efve population were as high as 95-100% leading to colossal economic losses. A death rate of around 200,000 animals per annum was recorded among the affected bovine population of 400,000 during the first half of the 1950s in India. Throughout the history of mankind, the social, economic and ecological consequences due to rinderpest had been more serious and severe. In India, the presence of rinderpest was confirmed by the Cattle Plague Commission (Hallen et al. 1871) . This disease has been conquered successfully by following mass vaccination along with zoo sanitary measures. The FAO declared the global eradication of rinderpest on 28 June 2011, marking it as the first ever viral disease of animals eradicated globally about three decades after the eradication of small pox, a viral disease of humans in 1980 (Yadav et al. 2016) . In India, dividing the country into four zones based on the epidemiological picture of the disease and adopting strategic and focused vaccinations at interstate and international borders and migration routes of bovines and caprine for creating immune belts, coupled with rigorous clinical and serosurveillance, were of great help in achieving freedom from the infection. With the successful eradication of rinderpest, the livestock sector across the globe became safer and consequently the livings of livestock farmers improved. Eradication of rinderpest helped in assuring inclusive growth as it mainly benefitted landless, marginal and smallholder livestock keepers, besides providing much needed animal protein, food and nutrition security and livelihood security. The milk production in India enhanced 2.99 times from the year 1955 to 1995 and further stepped to 4.796 times by 2006. Similarly, the bovine meat production increased by 17.99 times between 1959 and 1995. The income from bovine milk and meat increased to 102. 06 and 193.96 times, respectively, between 1950-1951 and 2005-2006 . In value terms these benefits amounted to 15563.56 million US dollars in respect of milk and 435,011 million US dollars for bovine meat from the year 1950 to 1996. It is estimated that India gained additional food production valuing 289 billion US dollars from 1965 to 1998 due to reduction in rinderpest incidence. This is one of the greatest contributions of veterinary scientists to crop production and dairy development programmes in India after Independence (Uppal 2011) .",

This knowledge should include the duration of incubation period; pathogenesis; route of entry of virus in the host species; extent and duration of excretion of the virus from the host; reservoir and carrier hosts; duration and mechanism of interepidemic survival of the virus; survival of the virus in nature including its susceptibility to high and low temperature, freezing and thawing, acid and alkaline pH and disinfectants; survival in body fluids; and antigenic variations, such as types, subtypes, clades and genotypes, particularly in RNA viruses. Appropriate knowledge of these parameters will be very useful in planning and implementing cost-effective disease control programmes. For example, in case of equine influenza, the knowledge that the virus is excreted for not more than 10 days from the infected animal can be used with advantage to check the spread of infection by restricting animal movements from infected to healthy premises and vice versa for 2 weeks. Similarly, all direct and indirect contacts between the sick and healthy animals and farms need to be avoided, besides symptomatic palliative treatment and complete rest to the sick animal to avoid secondary bacterial complications. In case the fever lasts for more than 3 days, antibiotic therapy should be considered to combat secondary bacterial infections. A three-day rest is recommended for each day of fever the animal had run in equine influenza. Influenza virus is highly susceptible to freezing and thawing and common disinfectants, such as Dettol, Savlon, 70% alcohol, phenyl, KMNO 4 , ultraviolet light and sunlight, but fairly resistant to sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) and sodium hydroxide (Yadav et al. 1993) . Thus, suitable cost-effective disinfectants may be used for decontamination of the stables and adjoining premises, ropes of animals, hands, shoes and clothing of animal attendants. The outbreaks of influenza, which are more common during winters, fade away in summer due to the susceptibility of the virus to high ambient temperatures.",

It can relapse due to immunosuppression on account of stress conditions due to pregnancy, hard work, cortisone therapy or other factors. Such carrier animals are thus potential source of infection for spreading the disease throughout their life. In the absence of a suitable vaccine, the only solution to limit the infection is by destruction of seropositive animals. However, in the absence of proper legislation, the owners did not agree to put down their EIA-positive animals immediately and have to be convinced about the accuracy and validity of the test by repeat tests of the animals on fresh serum samples in the same laboratory or at other laboratories in the same country or abroad. The authors, while confronted with this problem in India, made use of an old observation of a researcher wherein it was shown that an insect after feeding on an EIA-affected equine does not go beyond 200 meters and prefers to come back to the same host for the next blood meal, by isolating the seropositive animal in Coggins test (agar gel precipitation test) more than 200 meters away from other equines before they were put down.

Though at present only 11-18% of zoonotic pathogens from domestic livestock and carnivores are viruses, a significantly high number (55-59%) of emerging zoonotic pathogens are viruses. Approximately, 90 novel human pathogens were discovered during the last 30 years, averaging 3 per year, 66% of which were viruses, and more than 80% of these are RNA viruses. The propensity for emergence of new variants of RNA viruses is very high because of their small and segmented genome, rapid rate of multiplication and polymerase enzymes that lack proofreading capability. As a result, these viruses are more prone to exchange genetic material from related viruses when coinfecting the host by recombination or reassortment events. Pathogens that can infect multiple species and those that find a closely related host species in close proximity can jump species under suitable conditions and may cause the emergence of a new disease which may lead to epidemics/pandemics. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie, caused by prions, are examples of species jumping.

For ease of vaccination and reducing the stress to the animals and the vaccinator in controlling the animals, in future combined vaccines, multiple vaccines -peptide, split, thermostable, and recombinant vaccines -will be more in demand. Similarly, intradermal and pressure vaccination may become a common practice. Vaccination in advance stage of pregnancy should not be practiced to avoid immune tolerance in the newborn.

For profitable animal husbandry practices, prevention and control of diseases should be considered on cost-benefit ratio basis. The colossal losses are incurred during disease outbreaks like FMD, IBR, PPR, bluetongue, sheep pox, goat pox in livestock and IBD, MD, IB, EDS, CIA and avian influenza in poultry. Vaccines and judicial vaccination procedures are only ways to prevent and control such diseases in a cost-effective manner. The concept of vaccination was first popularized by Edward Jenner in 1798 as a method to fight against the deadly human small pox disease. However, prior to it, Chinese people were practicing a form of vaccination called 'ovination' where virulent sheep pox virus was inoculated in sheep to generate immunity against further infection with sheep pox virus. Similarly, in FMD, in the absence of a vaccine, 'apthization' (deliberately rubbing the infected fluid or lesions of diseased animals into the healthy animals of the farm/herd) was practiced with the objective of reducing the time, labour and cost towards the management of the outbreak in one go at the farm. The ILT virus, a herpes virus which causes respiratory disease in poultry, was recommended to be inoculated in the cloacal region to impart immunity in want of vaccine availability. However, now with the availability of dependable vaccines against most of the infectious diseases it is not advisable to use such methods as it has the risk of spreading the virulent virus to susceptible animals. After the successful initial approaches by Jenner using cow pox virus as vaccine against small pox in human, the concept of killed vaccine was made into use by Louis Pasteur in 1885 to prevent post-bite rabies disease in man. The mid-1940s designated as 'the era of cell culture' made a revolution in vaccine research to develop more attenuated live organisms as vaccine. Vaccine research has moved from the application of whole organism approach (inactivated or live attenuated) to synthetic antigenic peptide-based or gene-based vaccine approaches for man and animals against a number of infectious diseases.",

The emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS-coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A H5N1, Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example of zoonotic disease threats adversely affecting animal health and public health, national economies and food and nutrition security globally. Due to breach in the biosecurity, deadly viral diseases like FMD had re-surfaced in countries which were having disease-free status for decades. Disease incursions through imported livestock and poultry, fish and their products in the past in India have been responsible for the introduction of a number of diseases like PPR, bluetongue, IBR, IBD, CIA and classical swine fever (CSF) in India. AHS was responsible in the death of around 3,00,000 equines between 1959 and 1961 in Asia including India and other countries (Kumar 1976 ). Subsequent to its first occurrence in 1996 in China, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus H5N1 has affected more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The virus affected wild birds as well as domestic poultry. Sporadic cases of transmission to humans in close contact of infected birds with sizeable mortality raised pandemic concern of 'bird flu'. Since the first reporting of H5N1 virus from India and Bangladesh in 2006 and 2007, respectively, both these countries are experiencing outbreaks almost every year. The zoonotic disease outbreaks due to animal pathogens underline their double-sword action on animal human health, livelihoods of livestock farmers and food and nutritional security and safety.",

This necessitates redesigning and updating of the vaccines to include the new antigenic variants. Compared to DNA viruses, RNA viruses are more prone to such changes due to their inherent biology, such as segmented genome and possibility of exchange of genes from related virus types resulting into recombination and reassortment. These changes in influenza viruses are described as antigenic drift (gradual minor changes) and antigenic shift (major antigenic alterations). Thus, the need for continuous surveillance and monitoring of virus types in the population and updating of the vaccines becomes a costly and time-consuming proposition. It would be appropriate here to mention the phenomenon of 'antigenic sin' in case of influenza viruses where the infection of a new type of virus may give rise/boost up a detectable HI antibody response against a previous heterologous type/subtype infection.

Fights between dogs and jackals lead to the transmission of the rabies virus from jackals (sylvatic cycle) to urban cycle.

Under field conditions, a question is usually asked: if the host is already showing the symptoms of the disease, in that case, should vaccination be undertaken or not? The simple answer is 'no' as the antigen(s) present in the vaccine may make the host more susceptible to the disease as a result of the neutralization of existing humoral antibodies/immunity and diversion of the host immune system to respond to nonimmunogenic proteins in the vaccine will weaken the immune response against the vaccine. However, if the disease occurrence (outbreak) is detected in a closed (animal farm) or defined herd and we are able to detect and diagnose in the beginning, vaccination can be attempted with certain conditions. The first author has experienced handling an outbreak in a dairy farm of the institute, having about a hundred cows. On day 1, one cow was reported to be sick with high fever. Examination of the herd revealed that only one cow was having fever as well as lesions of FMD. Only one cow had fever but no lesions in the foot or mouth. Examination of the material collected from the foot-and-mouth lesions of the diseased cow confirmed an FMD virus antigen. The remaining cows in the herd were apparently normal and had no fever or FMD lesions. Two sick cows were separated at the farm. The remaining cows were administered inactivated aluminium hydroxide gel FMD vaccine. The sheds, dung, urine, fodder and feed waste were thoroughly decontaminated with 4% sodium carbonate (Na2 CO3) disinfectant before disposal for a week. The interior of the animal sheds including mangers, floor, walls and roof were also disinfected similarly. The milk was properly boiled before feeding to the suckling calves or discarded. This exercise proved effective as no further case of the disease was detected at the infected farm or in other dairy units or experimental animals maintained at the campus. The success may be attributed to the availability of expertise, diagnostic facilities and vaccine, taking prompt decision and action in dealing with the outbreak. Another situation is with rabies subsequent to the bite of a rabid animal; in that case, vaccination is recommended irrespective of the fact whether the animal had been earlier vaccinated against rabies or not. This type of vaccination practiced in rabies is termed as 'therapeutic' vaccination.",

In case of FMD virus which affects a number of ruminants and other species, it has been observed that after passage of the virus in cell culture while it became attenuated for one species, it remained pathogenic or became more virulent to other susceptible species. As a result, no safe live vaccine could be developed against FMD.",

However, it may not be always so, particularly while using inactivated vaccines and the route of infection is respiratory tract, because inactivated vaccines elicit a poor secretary IgA response which is not adequate to neutralize the virus in the respiratory tract. As a result, the virulent virus if contracted may be harboured in the respiratory tract of the host. Equine influenza and FMD viruses can be cited as examples. The FMD and influenza viruses may persist in the respiratory tract of vaccinated animals due to partial immunity. The FMD virus has been detected in the oesopharyngeal fluid for several months. Similarly, the presence of rabies virus in a few dogs as long as up to 2 years without showing any symptom necessitated the need to revise the policy of recommending vaccination even after the bite of a person by an apparently normal dog.",

Preparedness and combating the prevailing emerging, re-emerging and transboundary diseases require sound monitoring and precision detection systems that are flexible and adaptable under field conditions. There is also an international obligation for OIE reportable diseases of high importance from the point of view of trading in animals and animal products harbouring potent infectious agents/pathogens by all member countries of WTO. It is the right time to apply developed diagnostics and molecular detection tools at the field stage to ensure fast detection and confirmation of pathogens capable of causing diseases in humans and animals. This must be accompanied by national-level disease surveillance, monitoring and networking to enable an early warning system for infectious diseases based on forecasting (Saminathan et al. 2016) . Due priority is also required for application of new vaccines, developing vaccine delivery systems and adopting prudent vaccination programmes and immunomodulatory and effective therapeutic modalities, which would help in devising timely prevention and control strategies against viral and other infectious diseases. Besides these, good management and standard biosecurity measures/practices and appropriate hygienic and zoo-sanitary and quarantine measures should be observed. Moreover, on-the-spot control and checking the spread of pathogens and adequate trade restrictions as envisaged under the SPS agreement of WTO also need to be followed. A holistic vision is required for timely implementation of these concepts and strategies along with strengthening of various multidimensional research and development programmes backed with appropriate funding resources. These measures will greatly help minimize disease incidences and outbreaks and lessen economic burdens due to infectious animal diseases and boost livestock and poultry health, reproduction and production to strengthen sustainable growth of livestock and poultry industry. Reduction in pandemic threats and public health concerns eventually lead to improvement in the socioeconomic status and welfare of the society at large.",
