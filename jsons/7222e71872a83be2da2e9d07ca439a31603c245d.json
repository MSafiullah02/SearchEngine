Indeed, the possibility of foodborne transmission cannot be ruled out for any virus. However, these possibilities should be understood in-depth as supported by scientific data and analysis so that the virus spread could be controlled in a more focused and efficient way. In this review, we intend to make a comparison between coronaviruses (CoVs) with the most recognized foodborne virus, human NoVs, in order to supply evidence to evaluate the possibilities of foodborne transmission of CoVs. The comparisons were performed from four different perspectives including the epidemiological evidence, their presence in foods, their persistence in food systems, and their relevant clinical manifestations.",

The link between many of the illnesses and the human NoVscontaminated-food consumption has been clearly demonstrated (Table 1 ) thanks to the comprehensive investigations among all the components of a food control system. Typically, a successful foodborne outbreak investigation will need collaborative efforts from food law and regulations, food control management, inspection services, epidemiological and food monitoring (laboratory services) and consumers' education of and communication. Verhoef et al. [3] estimated the proportion of foodborne infections caused by human NoVs on a global scale to be as high as ~14%. Meanwhile, it should be well noted that large-scale outbreaks are often the result of a combination of several transmission routes. For example, the virus can first infect a sensitive population by food, water or an asymptomatic shedder, and a more efficient viral spread in a large group of population could be followed by direct person-to-person contact or via a contaminated environment.",

One may argue that the CoV presence could have been understudied and in the future, especially with the use of metagenomics technologies, CoVs might be able to be found within the viromes of foods. However, care should be taken when interpreting the results of virus detection from foods with the use of molecular methods. In-depth understanding over the virus quantities in relation to a dose-dependent effect and the virus viability (as the molecular methods detecting the presence of nucleic acids are not able to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viruses) are of crucial importance in order to determine the relevant public health influence. Figure 1 illustrates the foodborne transmission routes of human NoVs. Since viruses cannot multiply themselves without a host, after being shed to the environment, the viruses must be able to resist the possible environmental stress in the food systems, such as solar irradiation, desiccation, high or low temperature, unfavourable chemicals, etc., and remain infectious for durations long enough until being J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ingested again. In fact, human NoVs are known as the \"super survivor\" in the food systems as shown by numerous studies (Table 3) . Table 3 intends to compare the stability between NoVs and CoVs under different possible conditions in the food systems. Since molecular methods underestimate largely the infectivity decrease of viruses, we only included data generated with the use of cell culture based methods or from human volunteer studies.

Nevertheless, it seems that both NoVs and CoVs were able to remain infectious on foods and/or food packaging materials long enough (from several days to several weeks) to potentially cause transmission especially at low temperatures. 19] ), assumptions could be made that the viruses may migrate from the oral ingestion to the respiratory tracts via, for instance, the throat. However, this assumption will need sound experimental and/or clinical supports not only in a qualitative way (to show whether it is possible for the virus to migrate from oral ingestion to the respiratory tract), but also in a quantitative way. Since if large quantities of viruses must be ingested in order to cause the migration, the chance of such occurrence could be very low in reality.

On oysters, a 1-log reduction of both HAV and MNV occurred at 4\u00b0C, even after 14 days. However, a 5log reduction of MNV occurred on peppers at 4\u00b0C. MNV showed the shortest survival duration on peppers at all temperatures compared to the other viruses. Viral survival was better on oysters than on peppers. At a given temperature, HAV survived better at higher RH, while MS2 survived better at lower RH.

Surrogates including feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and coliphage MS2 that share pathological and/or biological features with human NoVs have been widely used to study the stability of human NoVs. For CoVs, although the mostof-interest strains are SARS-CoVs and other severe syndrome strains such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), working with BSL-3 laboratory containment places can cause significant practical challenges, and thus researchers have employed surrogates such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a diarrheal pathogen of swine, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a respiratory and enteric pathogen of laboratory mice, to study the survival and persistence of CoVs. Consequently, large variabilities were observed even within the NoVs or CoVs used in different studies",

Similarly, human coronavirus (HCoV) survived for 10-100 days in tap water, yet for only 2 to 4 days in wastewater [9]. At 25 \u00b0C, TGEV survived for 22 days, and MHV survived for 17 days in reagent-grade water, whereas in wastewater, TGEV survived for 9 days and MHV survived for 7 days [10]. Therefore, the matrices with different components tested with the viruses may play different roles, either in viral protection from the environmental stress, or as anti-viral agents alone or together with the external stress.",

            "text": ", when it comes to the disinfection studies, more straightforward comparisons become possible thanks to the availability of studies evaluating human NoV viability with the use of tissue culture model [11] and studies directly comparing NoV and CoV surrogates [12]. According to the results demonstrated in Tables 3, NoVs were clearly much more resistant than CoVs towards alcohols, chlorine and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. Foodborne viruses are transmitted via fecal-oral routes So far, all of the well-recognized foodborne viruses are transmitted via fecal-oral routes. For human NoVs, although our understanding on the cellular pathways that control infection and the exact pathogenesis remains limited [13-14], the recent breakthrough of human NoV in vitro cultivation systems with mucosaderived intestinal epithelial organoids [4] reveals clearly that human NoVs infection occurs primarily in the human digestive tracts. Besides, the clinical manifestations of human NoVs also have the following features being believed to contribute to its \"achievement as a successful foodborne virus\". First, human NoVs are extremely contagious. The infectious dose of human NoVs was estimated to be as low as 10 particles [15]. Second, once infected, human NoV particles can be shed from the stool and vomit of the patients in large quantities (e.g. up to >10 10 genomic copies per gram of feces [16]). Moreover, it has been discovered that asymptomatic infections with long-term fecal shedding (up to three weeks) of human NoVs can have a high prevalence, especially in the group of children [17]. CoVs, including the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, mainly spread through the respiratory tract. There are indeed reports showing the presence of CoVs in human fecal samples. For instance, in a recent investigation, 41 (55%) out of 74 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their fecal samples and the fecal shedding remained for a mean of 27.9 days after the first symptom J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f onset [18]. However, there is so far no clear evidence showing SARS-CoV-2 can cause infection in human digestive tracts. Considering the high probability of infection of SARS-CoV-2 (basic reproduction number estimated to be above 2.0 by WHO [",

            "text": "Based on our understanding, four important features are shared by foodborne viruses. I) Clear epidemiological evidence showing the link between relevant illnesses and the consumption of viruscontaminated foods; II) Records of virus presence in foods by the monitoring or surveillance studies, which in reality facilitate due diligence in the food supply chains or initiate recalls; III) High stability and resistance towards environmental stress in the food systems; IV) Fecal-oral transmission routes with infection occurring primarily in the human digestive tracts.In correspondence, the chance of foodborne transmission of CoVs is considered low and thus CoVs should not be recognized as foodborne viruses. CoV infection has never been found to link with food consumption, and so far CoVs have never been detected from foods either. Although CoVs indeed showed the possibilities to remain infectious on foods and/or food packaging materials long enough (from several days to several weeks) to potentially cause transmission, they were found to be less resistant to chemical and physical disinfections than NoVs. More importantly, CoVs mainly spread through the respiratory tractand there is no clear evidence showing CoVs can follow fecal-oral routes and cause infection in the human digestive tracts. In the future, the possibility of CoV infection via oral ingestion should be monitored closely, as many facts of these viruses still remain unrevealed and the viruses may evolve rapidly. In addition, care should be taken when interpreting results obtained with the emerging molecular technologies. As the trace of virus genetic materials may neither necessarily represent the presence of viable viruses thus nor the public J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f health threats. Lastly, when multiple transmission routes are identifiable, comprehensive consideration is necessary to set up the priorities and to control the virus spread efficiently.
