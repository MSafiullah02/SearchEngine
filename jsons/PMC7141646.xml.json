Health care teams around the world are working diligently to limit the spread of COVID-19 despite unprecedented challenges. In this letter, we provide additional strategies and a potential framework for maintaining successful patient care while limiting risks for faculty, residents, staff, and the community during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

To prevent infection of an entire specialty group, departments should consider adopting a team-based practice model to limit cross-contamination. Each team consists of a ratio of providers based on the individual institution's workforce. For example, 1 team in our department consists of 1 attending physician, 2 resident physicians, 2 nurses or medical assistants, and 1 supportive staff member. Individuals are in the clinic only if their team is conducting in-person visits that day. They are not allowed to have in-person contact with members outside of their designated team. In the event that a team member is exposed to or tests positive for COVID-19, only individuals within their team are required to self-quarantine for 14 days and/or be subsequently tested. By using this approach, cross-contamination is limited; thus, the department can continue to operate and deliver in-person care despite COVID-19 exposure.",

A key step is to implement this model as early as possible in combination with teledermatology, as other practices have already suggested.2\n,\n3 As depicted in the diagram, patients with high acuity, such as individuals with concerning lesions and potentially life-threatening eruptions, have priority for in-person visits. Simultaneously, continuity of care for existing patients can be achieved through teledermatology. With this system, patients can continue long-term management while decreasing the risk of exposure.",

We agree with these recommendations, although PPE has been in short supply, restricting successful implementation. Alternatively, sterilization of PPE equipment can help mitigate this limitation.",
