            "text": "Like many enveloped viruses, paramyxovirus requires virus\u2013cell fusion and mediates cell\u2013cell fusion.1 At least two viral membrane glycoproteins of the paramyxovirus fusion protein (F) and attachment protein (HN, H or G, depending on the genus) participate in the fusion process. For many paramyxoviruses, such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the attachment proteins (HN for NDV) are absolutely required for F protein-mediated cell fusion,1 while other paramyxoviruses, such as simian parainfluenza virus 5 (SV5)2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),3 fusion does not absolutely require attachment proteins. The mechanism underlying this difference is unclear. The F proteins of paramyxovirus contain conserved functional domains, which include the fusion peptide and two heptad repeat (HR) regions, called HR1 or HR-A and HR2 or HR-B.4 The fusion peptide, responsible for insertion of the F protein into the host cell membrane, is located immediately before the HR1 region in paramyxovirus. Biochemical and crystal structure studies demonstrated that the HR1 and HR2 could form a stable six-helix bundle, which is referred to as a trimer of HR1 and HR2 heterodimer or trimer of hairpins. This has been suggested to represent the core structure of the post-fusion F protein, known also as the fusion core.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 It has been shown that peptides derived from the HR regions could inhibit virus-mediated cell fusion, probably by disturbing the interaction of the HR regions during the conformational changes of the F protein.6\n",

            "text": "Like all the members in the Paramyxoviridae family, the NDV F protein is synthesized initially as a precursor, F0, and then cleaved into the disulfide-linked subunits F1 and F2 by a furin-like enzyme of the host cells.12 This cleavage of the F protein is necessary for protein maturation and fusion activation.13 The cleavability of the F0 protein is a key determinant for infectivity and pathogenicity of NDV.12 For avirulent NDV strains, the F protein cannot be cleaved by the furin-like enzyme in the cell culture and can exist as F0 only at the cell surface. Therefore, the fusion process cannot be fulfilled unless an exogenous protease such as trypsin is added to promote F0 cleavage into the fusion activation form. Previous studies14, 15, 16, 17 from our laboratory and others have shown that, similar to the HR2 peptides of the HIV-1 gp41 protein, the peptides derived from the NDV F protein HR2 regions could be used as inhibitors of F or virus-mediated cell fusion, but the inhibition activity of HR1 peptides was poorly characterized, likely due to their hydrophobicity, just as the HR1 peptides of the HIV-1 gp41 protein18, 19, 20. Interestingly, previous studies showed that peptides derived from the HR1 domain of the NDV F could inhibit F protein-mediated fusion only if added prior to the cleavage of the F0 protein in an in vitro transfection system.16 However, the mechanism involved was unclear. Our previous study showed that the free HR1 or glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion HR1 could not block the fusion process mediated by the NDV virulent strain.17 One possibility for this negative result could be due to the instability and aggregation of the in vitro prepared HR1, rather than the difference between virulent and avirulent strains. Therefore, it requires further experimentation with more stable preparations to distinguish between these possibilities in order to better characterize the NDV fusion mechanism. In this study, we built upon our previous constructs9 and designed three new proteins called HR121, HR212 and 5-Helix. The HR121 and HR212 were the 2-Helix proteins,9 plus another HR1 at the C terminus or another HR2 at the N terminus. The 5-Helix was just the 6-Helix protein,9 lacking one HR2 at the C terminus. These constructs were predicted to be more stable than the free HR1 or HR2 peptides based on the formation of a six-helix bundle.9 At the same time, they should serve also as inhibitors, based on the current conformational change model, as they have or lack one free HR domain. The biochemical characters of the designed proteins were analyzed and the fusion inhibition activities were determined using NDV (virulent and avirulent strains) mediated cell fusion as a model. The probable mechanism of fusion inhibition is discussed.",

Most of the GST fusion 5-Helix and HR121 proteins were soluble in the supernatants of the lysed E. coli cells when expressed at 30 \u00b0C, while GST-HR212 proteins were soluble when expressed at both 30 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. For elution of GST-5-Helix and GST-HR121 proteins, 150 mM NaCl was added to the elution buffer and an increased elution volume was used in order to improve the results. This is likely due to the hydrophobicity of the HR1 region. The 5-Helix, HR121 and HR212 were purified after removing the cleaved GST and GST-3C (Figure 2\n). The GST pull-down assay showed that GST-5-Helix and GST-HR121 could bind especially well with HR2 or HR212, while GST-6-Helix did not show any convincing binding (Figure 3\n). GST-HR212 could bind with HR1 peptides (Figure 3(c)). It was further demonstrated by gel-filtration analysis that GST untagged 5-Helix, HR121 and HR212 could interact with HR2 or HR1 peptides, respectively. After 5-Helix, HR121 and HR212 were mixed with HR2 or HR1 peptides, their elution peaks shifted as compared to those of the controls. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated an association between the proteins and the peptides (Figure 4\n), which indicated a specific interaction of the peptide partners. These results suggested that the designed proteins could be potential fusion inhibitors of NDV F protein-mediated cell fusion.",

This indicated that both HR121 and HR212 could form multimers, probably trimers. Subsequently, chemical cross-linking of HR121 and HR212 preparations showed that both dimers and trimers could be seen on a reducing gel (Figure 5\n(a) and (b)). Monomers/dimers tended to fade as the EGS cross-linker concentrations were increased, whereas the trimer bands became more prominent. These data implicated protein trimers, although the monomer/dimer bands were still visible, even in high concentrations of the cross-linker. It was also demonstrated by gel-filtration peak shifting that one trimer of HR121 or HR212 probably could bind three HR2 or HR1 molecules (Figure 4(b) and (c)).",

These results, as well as the GST pull-down assay (Figure 3), indicated that HR212 proteins performed their fusion inhibition activity through binding to the HR1 domain of F protein, but it was still unclear at which stage this occurred. To address this, a high concentration of HR212 proteins was added at different times after adsorption of the NDV virulent strain to HeLa cells. Strikingly, the HR212 proteins could inhibit cell fusion only at a very early stage of virus adsorption, i.e. before 2 min (Figure 10\n), which suggested that HR212 bound to the F protein at the early stage of conformational change.",

Great efforts have been made to elucidate the molecular mechanism of enveloped virus entry and fusion, with an increasing number of studies showing that most enveloped viruses have a similar fusion process. Therefore, similar studies on fusion inhibition have been conducted in recent years.4, 6, 21 Peptides derived from the heptad repeat regions of virus fusion proteins have been demonstrated to be fusion inhibitors for many enveloped viruses (class I), such as retrovirus and paramyxovirus. For HIV, a peptide called T-20 or Enfuvirtide\u00a9, derived from the HR2 (or C-peptide) domain of gp41 has currently finished the third clinical trial in USA as an anti-HIV drug.22 However, the high cost of peptide synthesis and instability limit the broad use of this drug. Studies showed that peptides corresponding to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HR1 or N-peptide) of gp41 were weak inhibitors of HIV fusion, likely due to their tendency to aggregate.19, 20 Much effort has been devoted to the design of more stable and effective protein inhibitors of HIV fusion, including N-peptides fused with trimeric coiled-coils,18 a chimeric protein termed NCCG-gp41,23 and a protein called 5-Helix.24 They were all demonstrated to prevent HIV fusion. In this study, we designed several protein inhibitors, including 5-Helix, on the basis of our previous studies of paramyxovius fusion,9 and the results showed that all the proteins could inhibit NDV-mediated cell fusion. This study showed also that all the proteins, including HR121 and HR212, were very stable and could be obtained easily by expression and purification. This design strategy should be tested for other enveloped viruses, especially HIV.",

            "text": "For paramyxovirus, virus fusion involves at least two envelope glycoproteins, an attachment protein and fusion protein, which are responsible for receptor binding and cell fusion, respectively. F protein is believed to mediate the fusion between the cellular membrane and the virus membrane through a series of conformational changes.1 In the current model,6 there are at least three conformational states of the F protein, i.e. a pre-fusion native state, pre-hairpin intermediate state and post-fusion state. In the post-fusion state, the two conserved HR regions bind each other in an anti-parallel fashion as a coiled-coil structure and form the so-called 6-Helix trimer.6 The two HR regions are highly conserved in all sequenced paramyxoviruses. Like HIV, many studies, including ours, showed that HR2 peptides could inhibit virus-mediated or F protein-mediated cell fusion in many paramyxoviruses, including NDV.15, 16, 17 However, details of the inhibition activity of HR1 peptides had not been clear so far. Our previous study showed that HR1 peptides derived from the NDV F protein had no fusion inhibition ability against NDV-mediated cell fusion,17 while the other studies showed HR1 peptides could inhibit F protein-mediated cell fusion if added before the F0 protein was cleaved.16 Like the HR1 of HIV gp41, the HR1 peptides of paramyxovirus fusion proteins are hydrophobic and tend to aggregate, so it is necessary to design more stable protein inhibitors that have the same function as HR1. We previously designed a construct called 2-Helix, which was a construct connecting HR1 and HR2 as a single chain (HR1\u2013HR2) and the results showed that the 2-Helix protein could form a stable six-helix bundle trimer.9, 10, 11 In this study, on the basis of the 2-Helix construct, another HR2 or HR1 was added at the N terminus or C terminus of 2-Helix, i.e. HR2\u2013HR1\u2013HR2 (HR212) and HR1\u2013HR2\u2013HR1 (HR121), to form two new constructs. A 5-Helix protein was constructed according to a recent HIV study.24 It was demonstrated that all the proteins were \u03b1-helical and thermostable, similar to 2-Helix.9 The 5-Helix and HR121 have the same binding character as HR1, and they are more stable than the single HR1 peptide. The HR212 has the same characteristics as HR2. Both fusion and plaque formation inhibition tests showed that only HR212 could inhibit NDV virulent strain-mediated cell fusion, while 5-Helix and HR121 could not, which was consistent with the results of our previous study.17 It indicated also that the fusion inhibition of HR212 was mediated through its binding activity to HR1 peptides. This suggests that HR212 might inhibit virus fusion through interacting with the HR1 domain of the intact F protein. All the designed proteins, including 5-Helix and HR121, could inhibit the fusion of the NDV avirulent strain if added before F0 was cleaved. This suggested that 5-Helix and HR121 probably interact with the corresponding domain of the F0 protein, not the cleaved F1/F2 complex. The paramyxovirus F protein is synthesized initially as a precursor, F0, which is cleaved into disulfide-linked F2 and F1 by the furin-like enzyme of the host cell. For the F0 protein of the NDV avirulent strain, the furin-like enzyme cannot cleave it into F1 and F2, so it cannot be activated to promote cell fusion. Additional enzymes are required to cleave the F0 protein to promote the infection with the avirulent stain. Using this system, it was convenient to detect the inhibition activity of the peptides that were added before F0 cleavage. On the basis of our results, peptides corresponding to the HR1 and HR2 domains of the NDV F protein can inhibit virus-mediated cell fusion, but the inhibition probably occurs through a different mechanism, e.g. at different stages of F protein conformational changes.",

This was in contrast to the results of others,16 which showed that both HR1 and HR2 could inhibit cell fusion only when added prior to cleavage activation. As a further characterization, we detected the inhibition of HR212 added at different stages of virus attachment. The results showed that HR212 could exhibit high fusion inhibition only when added as early as 2 min after virus attachment. There was almost no inhibition detected if added after 10 min after the attachment. This result implied that the conformational changes of the F protein occurred very quickly after receptor binding to the HN protein, and that this change was irreversible (i.e. HR212 could interact with the F protein only at the very early stage of fusion). This may explain why the inhibition activity was much lower if added after cleavage activation. However, all these results are still consistent with the idea that HR2 peptides could interact both with cleaved and uncleaved F protein, while the HR1 peptides could interact only with the F0 protein to inhibit virus fusion.",

Previous studies have shown that HR1 peptides derived from the paramyxoviruses whose fusion absolutely requires HN proteins (or its homologue G or H) appear to not have any fusion inhibition,17, 25, 26 whereas the HR1 peptides derived from the paramyxoviruses whose fusion does not absolutely require the attachment protein show the fusion inhibition effect.14, 27 Therefore, we assumed that the interaction of the HN and F proteins plays an important role in the HR1/HR2 domain exposure during conformational changes of the F protein. It had been accepted that the conformational change of the F protein was promoted by the HN protein binding to the receptor,4 and several studies showed that the HN protein was associated with the F protein.25, 28, 29 Co-expression of the HN and F proteins does alter the conformation of cell-surface F protein.30 In addition, a recent report demonstrated that the HN protein of NDV could interact with the HR2 domain of the F protein,31 indicating that this type of interaction may affect the fusion inhibition of HR1 peptides. According to this result, we supposed that the HR2 domain of the mature F protein was hidden by the interaction with the HN protein, and this interaction continues with the conformational change of the F protein. This may be the reason why HR1 peptides cannot bind to block fusion. However, the HR2 domain of the immature F0 protein was not covered by the HN protein and can be exposed to external HR1 peptides. Additional studies are required to clarify the detailed interaction of HN/F along with associated conformational changes.",

Bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 150 mM NaCl). Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the lysate was incubated for 30 min at 0 \u00b0C and subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 \ng for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The clarified supernatants were passed over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (equalibrated with PBS). The GST fusion protein-bound column was washed with ten column volumes of PBS and eluted with three column volumes of 10 mM reduced glutathione (an extra 150 mM NaCl was added for elution of 5-Helix and HR121 fusion proteins). The GST fusion proteins were then cleaved by GST-fusion rhinovirus 3C protease (kindly provided by Drs K. Hudson and J. Heath) at 5 \u00b0C for 16 h in cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)). The free GST and the GST-3C protease were removed by passage through the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column again.
