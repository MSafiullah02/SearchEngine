The overwhelming majority of cardiovascular and cancer patients are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection; accordingly, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities are playing a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients. Many of the therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, or treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago, and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities. Here we have provided a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.",

These therapies range from vaccines, to repurposed treatments for influenza, to drugs that were not effective in Ebola patients, to treatments for malaria that were developed decades ago. Recognizing that patients with underlying cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular disease, or cancer have an increased risk for adverse outcomes with COVID-19, and recognizing that these vulnerable populations may be enrolled in COVID-19 clinical trials, here we present a critical review of the rationale for the different therapeutics that are currently being employed. As background, we first review the epidemiology of COVID-19, followed by the biology of coronavirus. We then briefly define the complex interplay between the coronavirus and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is directly relevant to the care of the majority of patients with cardiovascular disease or cancer who are receiving drugs that modulate this system. Finally, we review the mechanisms of action the multiple therapies that are currently being studied in clinical trials. Given the breadth of information that is emerging, we will not discuss the role of vaccines.",

While there is a great deal that still remains to be 4 understood, initial reports from 552 hospitals in China describing 1,099 of the 7,736 COVID-19 infected patients provide some insight into the disease (1) . In this multi-center retrospective analysis, the majority were Wuhan residents or had contact with Wuhan residents, although 25 .9% were neither. The median age of patients was 47 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 35 to 58), and 41.9% were female. Patients with more severe disease tended to be older, and tended to suffer from at least one comorbidity, compared to those with non-severe disease. In this retrospective analyses, patients commonly received intravenous antibiotics (58.0%). Oseltamivir was administered in 35.8%, systemic steroids in 18.6%, and oxygen in 41.3%. The median duration of hospitalization was 12.0 days, interquartile range 10.0-14.0 days); however, the majority of the patients (93.6%) remained hospitalized at the time of data analyses and as such, the clinical course still largely remains to be defined.",

ACE plays a critical role in activation of the RAS, by processing Angiotensin I (Angiotensin 1-10) to Angiotensin II (Angiotensin 1-8), the major effector peptide of RAS , which mediates its effects through selective interactions with G-protein coupled Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors (17) . ACE, however, has not been implicated in the entry of human coronaviruses into cells. 9 ACE2 is highly expressed in the mouth, tongue, and type I and II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs. ACE2 is also abundantly expressed by cardiovascular endothelium, cardiac myocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, as well as epithelial cells of the kidney and testis. The major substrate of ACE2 is angiotensin II, which is cleaved to Ang 1-7 (Figure 1) , and functions through association with the G-protein-coupled receptor Mas receptor. The ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas receptor axis is regarded as the counter-regulatory arm of the RAS by opposing the effects of the ACE-Angiotensin II axis-AT1. Although the precise role of ACE2 is still being evaluated, studies been shown that ACE2 exerts protective effects in the pulmonary and the cardiovascular systems, where it serves to oppose the deleterious effects of RAS activation (18) (19) (20) .",

Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 can result in uptake of virions into endosomes (Central Illustration). Viral entry into the cell requires priming of the S protein by the serine protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which cleaves the viral S protein at the S1/S2 and the S2' site, and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes (21) . The S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can also use pH sensitive endosomal proteases (cathepsin B and L) for priming and entry into cells. Interestingly, the binding affinity the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain to ACE2 is 10-to 20-fold higher than the binding of the SARS-CoV ectodomain to ACE2 (15) . The increase in stickiness of the SARS-CoV-2 capsid S protein makes disease transmission more likely, and might explain the increased person-to-person transmission with SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. Insofar as the viral S proteins are the part of the virus that interacts with the immune system, they may serve as a promising target for vaccines.",

As shown in Figure 1 , activation of ADAM-17 results in the proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 (referred 11 to as shedding) from the cell surface, with the release of the catalytically active soluble ACE2 (sACE2) ectodomains into the circulation (referred to as soluble ACE2) (20, 23) . A decrease in ACE2 levels on the cell surface would be expected to result in a decrease in the levels Ang 1-7 levels (cytoprotective) and a corresponding increase in tissue levels of angiotensin-II (proinflammatory and pro-fibrotic). The importance of SARS-CoV2-induced down regulation of cell surface ACE2 was demonstrated in experimental studies, wherein administration of recombinant human ACE2 protein, genetic deletion of the AT1 receptor or administration of an AT1 receptor antagonist were shown to be protective in acute lung injury models (19, 20) . These, and other observations have suggested that the use of AT1 receptor antagonists may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients (24) , and consistent with this, losartan is currently being tested in randomized, double-blind placebo controlled studies as a potential therapy in hospitalized infected patients ( Table 1) . Relevant to this discussion, the ACE inhibitors in clinical use do not directly affect ACE2 activity (25) . The biological significance of circulating sACE2 is not known. Of note, sACE2 retains its ability to bind the S protein of SARS-CoV and was shown prevent entry of SARS-CoV into cells in vitro (26) . Thus, sACE2 may act as a decoy receptor that prevents SARS-CoV-2 from binding to ACE2 on the cell surface. APN01 is a human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) that has been shown to block the early stages if SARS-CoV-2 infections in cell culture and human tissue organoid cultures. (27) . APN01has already undergone safety and tolerability testing in a phase II trial I healthy volunteers (NCT00886353), but at the time of this writing is not being tested clinically in COVID-19 patients.",

However, as noted in a recent review on this topic, the experimental and clinical data often yield conflicting results with respect the role of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists on ACE2 levels in different pathophysiological contexts (30) , suggesting the effects on RAS inhibitors on ACE2 are complex and nuanced, and should not be assumed to be the same for all RAS inhibitors, nor should it be assumed that changes in ACE2 levels in the heart or other tissues necessarily reflect changes in ACE2 levels in the lung, which is the portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2. Given that we have limited understanding with respect to the interaction of RAS inhibitors, ACE2 levels and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in humans, we do not believe that it is possible to make definitive statements that go beyond the joint statement issued on March 17, 2020, by the Heart Failure Society of America/the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, who together recommended \"continuing RAAS antagonists for those patients who are currently prescribed such agents for indications for which these agents are known to be beneficial\" (31) .",

In the endocytic pathway, the endocytosed virions are subjected to an activation step within the endosome, which is typically mediated by the acidic environment of the endosome, resulting in fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, which allows for the 13 release of the viral genome into the cytosol. Several viruses, including HIV and SARS-CoV use direct membrane fusions at the cell surface or endocytosis to enter cells. As noted above, recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, which is leads to endocytosis of the receptorvirus complex (21) . What is not known at this time is whether SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of directly fusing with the lipid membrane of cells. However, based on the similarities of how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 behave, it is likely that their modes of entry into cells will be similar. Understanding these differences in cell entry has implications for developing novel therapeutics.",

Camostat mesylate has already shown to inhibit replication of influenza and parainfluenza viruses and to prevent the 14 development of pneumonia and viral myocarditis in infected mice (34) . Given that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is activated by the pH dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L, this processing step may be sensitive to inhibition with drugs that indirectly inhibit cathepsin L activity by interfering with endosomal acidification (e.g. bafilomycin A1), or by compounds which directly block the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L.",

Inside cells, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are rapidly protonated and concentrated in endosomes. The positive charge of the chloroquine increases the pH of the endosome, which prevents cathepsin-induced priming of the viral S protein. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine decrease SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultured cells; however, hydroxychloroquine was more potent than chloroquine (35) . In a small single-arm study of patients with confirmed COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was associated with a significant difference in clearing of viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 within 3 -6 to days when compared to untreated controls. Azithromycin when added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination (36) . However, both therapies can result in QT prolongation, and as such, caution needs to be exercised when using these therapies together.",

As detailed below, Hydroxychloroqine will be used as one of the treatment arms in the World Health Organization (WHO) multi-national SOLIDARTY trial (38) , and is also currently being investigated in a number of other studies (Tables 2 and 5) . Interestingly, amiodarone, which is a cationic amphiphile, was shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection in vitro in target cells, using 15 concentrations of amiodarone that overlapped those detected in the sera of patients treated for arrhythmias. Both amiodarone and its main metabolite, monodesethyl amiodarone (MDEA), were shown to interfere with the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, thus blocking viral replication (39) . Amiodarone has also been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV infection and spreading in vitro, by altering the late compartments of the endocytic pathway by acting after the transit of the virus through endosomes (40) . Once the genomic RNA of SARS-CoV is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell, the positive-strand viral RNA is translated on host ribosomes into one large polypeptide termed the replicase, which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to yield proteins that are required from genome replication, including a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The viral RdRp generates a full-length, antisense negative-strand viral RNA template, which is used for replicating positive strand viral genomic RNA, as well as shorter subgenomic negative strand RNAs that serve as templates for synthesizing mRNAs that code for structural proteins of the virus, including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.",

Given that the vast majority of cardiovascular patients are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology community will play a major role in caring for COVID-19 patients now and for the foreseeable future. As a community, we have a long tradition of enrolling patients into clinical trials that evaluate therapeutic agents whose mechanism(s) of action is familiar, which has for clinical equipoise when enrolling patients in clinical trials. In the coming months that lie ahead our communities 20 will be asked to contribute patients to clinical trials where the mechanism of action of the therapeutic agents is less familiar and the knowledge base required for providing care for COVID-19 is accelerating at a dizzying pace. Here we have tried to provide a foundation for cardiovascular physicians who are on the frontline providing care to COVID-19 patients, so that they can better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology of COVID-19, as well as the biological rationale for the plethora of clinical trials that are either being designed or are currently recruiting patients. 21 ",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein. The S protein is responsible for facilitating entry of the CoV into the target cell. The routes employed by SARS-CoV include endocytosis and membrane fusion. The route employed by SARS-CoV-2 is via endocytosis; whether SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by membrane fusion is not known. Binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV to ACE2, lead to the in uptake of the virions into endosomes, where the viral spike protein is activated by the pH dependent cysteine protease cathepsin L. Activation of the spike protein by cathepsin L can be blocked by bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride, which indirectly inhibit the activity of cathepsin L by interfering with endosomal acidification. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are weak bases that diffuse into acidic cytoplasmic vesicles such as endosomes, lysosomes, or Golgi vesicles and thereby increases their pH. MDL28170 inhibits calpain and cathepsin L. SARS-CoV can also directly fuse with host cell membranes, after processing of the virus spike protein by TMPRSS2, a type II cell membrane serine protease. Camostat mesylate is an orally active serine protease inhibitor. , which is the major effector peptide of the renin angiotensin system. Angiotensin II mediates its effects through selective interactions with G-protein coupled Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R) receptors. Angiotensin II is degraded to Ang 1-7 by angiotensin converting enzyme 2, Ang 1-7 binds to the Mas receptor (not shown). The ACE2-Ang (1-7)-Mas receptor axis opposes the effects of ACE-Angiotensin II-AT1-axis. The binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 induces ACE2 shedding by activating ADAM-17. A decrease in ACE2 levels would be expected to result in a decrease in the levels Ang 1-7 levels (cytoprotective) and a corresponding increase in tissue levels of angiotensin-II (pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic). TMPRSS2, a type II cell membrane serine protease that activates the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and allows it to bind to ACE2.

The metabolites of Ribavirin resemble adenosine or guanosine nucleosides that then become incorporated into viral RNA and inhibits RNA-dependent replication in RNA viruses. Ribavirin is currently FDA approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS\u00ae). Protease Inhibitors. Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor class that is used in fixed-dose combination with another protease inhibitor, Ritonavir (Lopinavir/Ritonavir [Kaletra\u00ae]]) for the treatment of HIV. Results from a randomized, open-label study of 199 hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection assigned 1:1 to Lopinavir 400mg-Ritonavir 100mg twice daily for 14 days with standard of care or standard of care alone were recently published (46). All patients had an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air or a ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) <300. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement, where clinical improvement was defined based on an ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital. The study was designed for 80% power with a 2-sided significance level of \u03b1 of 0.05 to detect an 8-day difference in median time to clinical improvement. Here, the median time to clinical improvement was 16.0 days (IQR 13.0, 17.0 days) in the Lopinavir-18 Ritonavir group compared to 16.0 (IQR 15.0, 18.0 days) with standard care. The mortality at 28 days in the treatment group was similar to that observed in the standard care group (19.2% versus 25%, difference -5.8%, 95% CI -17.3, 5.7), as was the detectable viral load. However, there were some suggestions of potential benefit with lopinavir-ritonavir with a shorter ICU stay (median 6 days versus 11 days) and a shorter time to hospital discharge (median 12 days versus 14 days). As noted, the fixed dose combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir is one of the treatment arms in the SOLIDARITY trial (Table 3) (38). Immunomodulatory Therapies: Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines activate the innate immune system in response to viral infection. Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) are synthesized by most cell types in the body response to a viral infection, whereas type II interferon (IFN-\u03b3) is produced by immune cells following antigen stimulation. Both Type I and Type II interferons provoke the synthesis of proteins that have antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Recombinant IFN-\u03b2 has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro more effectively than either IFN-\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (47,48). Interestingly, IFN-\u03b3 downregulates the expression of ACE2 on the cell surface and protects type I pneumocytes from SARS-CoV infection (49). The combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and IFN-\u03b21b is being evaluated in the treatment of laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospitalization",

(a) The SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein attaches to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell surface. Upon entering the cytoplasm, the viral core particle, which contains the positive (5'-3') strand genomic RNA, is released into the cytoplasm of the cell (b). The positive-strand viral RNA is translated on host ribosomes to generate a large polyprotein (c) that undergoes proteolytic processing to generate multiple viral proteins, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). (d) The RdRp generates a full-length, antisense negative-strand (3'-5') viral RNA strand (d) that serves as template for replicating positive strand viral genomic RNA, as well as shorter negative strand RNAs (e) that serve as templates for synthesizing mRNAs that code for structural proteins of the virus (f), including the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Translation of viral mRNAs occurs using the host endoplasmic reticulum (g). Once the viral structural proteins, S, E, and M are translated and inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum, they move along the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (h). The viral proteins become encapsulated and bud into membranes containing viral structural proteins, where mature virons become assembled. (i) Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis (k) (ACE2 = Angiotensin converting enzyme, ER = endoplasmic reticulum, ERGIC = emdoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartmen) (Modified from Turner et al, Trends Pharmacol Sci 2004;25:291-4.1",

Recent studies have also demonstrated that overall 19.7% of patients suffer from cardiac injury(8).

There have been case series published on COVID-19 infection in heart transplant recipients. Two confirmed cases suggest similar presentations to non-transplant recipients and both patients demonstrated clinical improvement. A questionnaire of 87 heart transplant recipients in China, of which importantly 96.6% undertook quarantine procedures, did not suggest a markedly elevated rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population (11,12).
