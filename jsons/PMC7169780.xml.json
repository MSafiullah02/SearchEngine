The detection of multiple viruses has been reported in 22% of Brazilian transplant patients 11. Recent studies reported a frequency of 21.4% and 10% of dual respiratory viral infection in children with bronchiolitis after molecular assays were added to the diagnostic list of clinical laboratories 12, 13. Therefore, when using modern and sensitive methods, such as real\u2010time PCR, in the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections, even higher rates of viral codetection are anticipated to be found in the transplant setting 11. As shown before 11, the detection of multiple respiratory viruses in transplant recipients was not associated with a poor prognosis in these patients.",

In previous investigations, using conventional diagnostic methods (i.e., direct immunofluorescence and viral culture), the incidence of PIV III infection following transplantation varied from 2\u20139% 4, 14. On the other hand, studies based on PCR revealed a higher frequency of PIV III infection, as high as 14.0% 4. In contrast to transplant patients, in whom PIV III was the predominant virus, RSV was the main cause of respiratory infections in the non\u2010transplant population (54.5%), referred to the same hospital. The high RSV frequency detected in non\u2010transplant patients suggests that most of these patients were probably children, which is in accordance with the literature that suggests that RSV is one of the most common causes of severe lower respiratory disease in young children 15. Human rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are frequently associated with the common cold and are generally considered to replicate principally within the upper respiratory tract 16. Despite the high frequency of these viruses in the population, the real importance of these agents in the transplant population remains to be determined 16.",

Even though a previous study showed prolonged hBOV shedding in non\u2010transplant children 7, only 1 patient with hBOV infection was included in our study, and therefore, we were not able to properly evaluate hBOV shedding in our transplant cohort.

Another limitation was the small number of transplant patients studied.

Because viral shedding is prolonged in these patients (as demonstrated by the current study), this criterion could have reduced the number of patients enrolled in our study 9. Furthermore, it is already known that transplant patients have fewer and milder symptoms. Because of this fact, we could have missed some patients with mild to no symptoms, which could affect the estimated duration of shedding.",
