            "text": "Pneumonia is a common illness that continues to be the major killer of young children in developing countries and elderly people in developed countries. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, and now attention is turning to the importance of viruses as pathogens. Widespread introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines into immunisation programmes has led to speculation about the growing predominance of viruses as causes of childhood pneumonia. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, and the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus has re-emphasised the important role of respiratory viruses as causes of severe pneumonia. New respiratory viruses\u2014such as human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus\u2014have been discovered during the past decade. Importantly, the availability of molecular diagnostic assays (such as PCR) has greatly increased our ability to detect and characterise the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies, in which conventional virological diagnostic techniques were used, have most likely underestimated the role of viruses as pneumonia pathogens.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 In this Seminar, we review viral community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent children and adults, focusing on studies that have used modern molecular diagnostic techniques.",

In a Canadian study, 25 319 admissions for childhood pneumonia took place during the 9-year study period; 11 deaths were recorded and only one death did not have a comorbid condition.10 Mortality of 1\u00b72 per million previously healthy young adults has been recorded in the UK.11 In the USA alone, the economic burden of community-acquired pneumonia has been estimated to be more than US$17 billion annually.12\n",

For diagnosis of viral pneumonia, reliance on testing of nasopharyngeal specimens presents its own challenges; detection of a virus in the nasopharynx could represent coincidental upper-respiratory infection or a pneumonia pathogen. Measurement of background prevalence of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal viral infection in a control group might help to clarify the size of this diagnostic issue at a population level, but this approach has been used only rarely in aetiological studies. Furthermore, most research has focused on patients admitted to hospital and, therefore, findings might not be representative of mild-to-moderate disease.",

Respiratory viruses have been noted in 95% of mucus samples obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration from children with respiratory infection.16 Obtaining an aspirate is, however, unpleasant and requires a suction device. Nasal swabs taken with a sterile cotton swab from a depth of 2\u20133 cm have comparable sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates for culture of all major respiratory viruses, except respiratory syncytial virus.17 Flocked swabs with nylon fibres in a perpendicular fashion are now preferred by many clinicians because they are convenient to use and have a similar sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates for detection by PCR of respiratory viruses.15, 17, 18 In adults, nasopharyngeal swabs have a higher sensitivity than throat swabs, but they can be less sensitive than nasopharyngeal washes.14 Transnasal nasopharyngeal flocked swabs also have high virus detection rates in adults.19, 20\n",

However, bacteria and viruses alone or together can induce a broad range of chest radiographic changes, and alterations are only helpful in specific cases to confirm a microbial cause of pneumonia. In one study, bacterial infection was noted in 97 (71%) of 137 children with alveolar infiltrates, whereas 97 (72%) of 134 with bacterial pneumonia had alveolar infiltrates.33 In children with viral pneumonia, 40 (49%) had alveolar changes. Of 85 children with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, alveolar infiltrates were recorded in 77 (91%) and interstitial infiltrates alone in eight (9%).37 Multilobe disease in various cases of viral pneumonia was reported in half of 88 adults with community-acquired pneumonia.19 Thoracic CT indicated tree-bud opacities, multifocal consolidations, and ground-glass opacities in adults with viral pneumonia without any evidence of possible concomitant bacterial infection; however, a viral cause was never suggested by the radiologists.38\n",

Globally, respiratory syncytial virus continues to be the major causative viral agent of pneumonia in children and could be the predominant viral cause of severe pneumonia in this population.52, 53 With the advent of PCR techniques, rhinoviruses have been detected increasingly in childhood pneumonia.54 The clinical profile of 643 rhinovirus infections in children admitted to hospital has been reported in seven studies,55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 and 11\u201353% had pneumonia. However, the role of rhinoviruses in pneumonia is still questioned because of the frequent detection of rhinoviruses in asymptomatic individuals (mean prevalence 15%), strikingly more than for other respiratory viruses (prevalence 1\u20135%).62 Jartti and colleagues suggested that PCR is likely to detect a true but asymptomatic infection.62 A difficulty with rhinoviruses is the paucity of serological tests to verify acute infection. In immunocompetent individuals, rhinoviral clearance after symptomatic infection is rapid (average 1\u20133 weeks).18\n",

These researchers noted dual viral infection in 67 (5%) cases. Detection of several viruses in a fairly high proportion of cases has been a feature of pneumonia aetiological studies in which PCR was used. In particular, for childhood pneumonia, two or three viruses have been detected in 10\u201320% of children.21, 30, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 Specifically, human bocavirus is detected frequently in association with other respiratory viruses.67, 68, 69 In a Thai pneumonia study, 40 (91%) of 44 children younger than 5 years with human bocavirus infections had co-infection with other viruses.68 The combination of human bocavirus and rhinovirus was the most typical dual infection. In a comprehensive virological study of childhood pneumonia, two or more viruses were detected in 61 (18%) of 338 pneumonia episodes, and three viruses were recorded in nine cases.41 Human bocavirus was associated with other viruses in 33 (69%) of 48 episodes, followed by influenza viruses (13/25; 52%) and respiratory syncytial virus (34/67; 51%). In another study, 64% of children with human bocavirus infection and co-infection with another virus had serological evidence of acute human bocavirus infection.69\n",

Some experts recommend that all patients with pneumonia should receive antibiotic treatment, because exclusion of the presence of bacterial infection is impossible. Recommendations of the British Thoracic Society are that antibiotic treatment can be withheld in young children with mild illness in whom viral infection is likely.1 As far as we know, only one randomised placebo-controlled study has been done to investigate the need for antibiotic treatment in childhood community-acquired pneumonia.133 In 136 children, no clinically significant efficacy of antibiotics was recorded. Most study children had fairly mild disease and the investigation was undertaken during an epidemic of respiratory syncytial virus, so most participants probably had pneumonia caused by this virus. Further randomised placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic treatment for pneumonia are unlikely to happen because of ethical concerns.",

In children and adults, neuraminidase inhibitors reduce median time to resolution of symptoms by 0\u00b75\u20132\u00b75 days when administered within 48 h of onset of symptoms.135 Importantly, early use of neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce development of complications such as pneumonia.136 The Infectious Diseases Society of America extends treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors to admitted influenza patients whose onset of symptoms is more than 48 h before presentation.137 Selection of the most appropriate antiviral to treat influenza should be made on the basis of relevant susceptibility data. Before emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, the seasonal H1N1 virus developed resistance to oseltamivir, and treatment with either zanamivir or amantadine or rimantidine was recommended, whereas the seasonal H3N2 virus was resistant to amantadine and rimantidine. If subtype information is unavailable, zanamivir or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine is recommended.137 The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus remains susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, and oseltamivir has been used widely for treatment of pneumonia caused by this virus. Although resistance to oseltamivir has been reported in people with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus infection, it has been largely restricted to immunocompromised individuals.103 All isolates are still susceptible to zanamivir. Intravenous use of peramivir or zanamivir could be lifesaving in critically ill patients with influenza.138, 139\n",

Influenza vaccines have been used since the mid 1940s and they now have an established role in prevention of influenza A and B virus infections. Importantly, inactivated influenza vaccine is effective in young children, including those younger than 2 years.150 During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a monovalent vaccine against the virus was developed.103 Its active use could have played a part in the course of the initial pandemic wave in some countries\u2014eg, in Finland, only 44 fatal cases were recorded. In addition to vaccines, influenza A and B virus infections can be prevented by prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors.137 Severe respiratory syncytial virus infections in high-risk neonates have been prevented successfully with palivizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody, which is administered during a respiratory syncytial virus epidemic.151 This agent has been shown to prevent admissions related to respiratory syncytial virus by 50% in premature infants. Since the 1960s, several types of vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus have been developed without success. Live-attenuated vaccines produced by reverse genetics are now in clinical studies.142 Pneumonia caused by adenovirus types 4 and 7 has been prevented in military trainees by an oral vaccine, with 95% efficacy. Unfortunately, conflict over the manufacturing process stopped production in 1996.95 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was shown to prevent a third of viral pneumonia cases in a study in South Africa, most probably by prevention of superimposed bacterial co-infections.152\n",
