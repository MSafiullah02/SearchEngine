Events such as the 1918-1919 \"Spanish Flu\" pandemic and the Black Death have devastated communities, cities and continents, causing sickness and mortality well beyond the burden of disease experienced in normal times. This chapter will explore the nature of communicable diseases, a brief history of pandemics, and will introduce the mathematical models used to evaluate the risk pandemics pose to human populations. Such modelling is used in a public health context, where modelling past and current events provides insight in how to respond most effectively to a new outbreak. It is also used in the context of risk mutualisation and transfer. As recently as 2013, a survey of 30,000 insurance executives placed global pandemic as the biggest extreme risk facing insurers (Towers Watson 2013). The chapter will introduce the principles used to model these events in the insurance industry and will conclude with a review of the way these models are applied in an unconventional risk transfer context.

Epidemic diseases are diseases where the number of cases \"spikes\", or temporarily exceeds established baseline caseloads. What constitutes an epidemic will depend on the nature and prior history of the pathogenic agent. Features of the exposed population including its size and susceptibility to the pathogen, and the spatio-temporal characteristics of the outbreak are all factors that are used to define whether an epidemic is occurring. Taking Dengue as an example, an epidemic could be characterised by substantial increase in caseloads in an area where Dengue has an established moderate baseline of cases, or if a small number of cases were to emerge in an area that had no prior history of Dengue.

Generally, it is emerging or re-emerging diseases readily transmissible between humans that have the potential to cause pandemics. This is because there is little to no immunity in the world population and because the disease will propagate through the population via usual human-to-human contact, respectively. Zoonosis is a key biological mechanism by which novel infectious diseases emerge. Taking the 2009 H1N1 pandemic as an example, the origin of this disease was a pig in Mexico. The novel virus emerged via the process of reassortment, where two different strains of influenza, one endemic in North American pigs and the other in Eurasian pigs, infected the same animal. The two viruses exchanged genetic material (RNA) to result in a new virus significantly different from its precursors. This antigenic shift means that the immune systems of humans and swine have never been exposed to this disease before and therefore do not possess the antibodies to halt infection. This coupled with the property that it was relatively readily transmissible resulted in large swaths of the world population being infected (Smith et al. 2009 ).

The most commonly used models are called population (compartmental) models. Developments by WH Hamer, Sir Ronald Ross and Kermack and McKendrick between 1910 and 1930 resulted in the core mathematical models that continue to be used to understand and predict the transmission of infectious diseases today (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) . These deterministic dynamical models have been extended to stochastic variants for use under certain circumstances, and for modelling diseases with other modes of transmission than those originally studied, as well as for studying endemic and endemo-epidemic diseases. Age structure and spatial structure have been introduced as further features to the dynamical models. More detailed spatial structure between subpopulations, taking account of social groups and travel patterns, captures a subclass of pandemic models with increased spatial heterogeneity. Network models of infectious disease take advantage of modern computing power and increased amounts of readily available social network data to model transmission based on models of individual people's contacts with others in their social groups. Agent-based models go one step further and Where the animal is marked with an asterisk (*), this indicates that the disease's zoonotic origin was traced back to the same animal host. Note that where there is no observed recent animal-to-human transmission for some diseases, it remains likely that the disease's earliest origins were via zoonosis. Smallpox's mode of transmission is suspected to be airborne but was not fully confirmed before its extinction in 1979 (Milton 2012) (if applicable) and pathogenic agents, thus removing some of the assumptions underlying the dynamical models and attempting to generate real-world epidemic behaviour directly from the interactions of the agents. 5 By definition, pandemics occur only if the susceptible population is sufficiently large that sustained transmission can occur over large swaths of the planet. For this to happen, there needs to be low residual immunity in the population: it is emerging or re-emerging pathogens that are likely to give rise to pandemics. Moreover, in an unconventional risk transfer context, the principal use case is to model the risk of emergence of a novel pathogen capable of reaching pandemic scale, and subsequently the size, scale and impact of that pandemic. It is for this reason that industry focuses its attention on population models with spatial heterogeneity: they are able to capture the large-scale behaviour of pandemics relevant to counterparties involved in risk transfer transactions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 261, "end": 272, "text": "Kermack and", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 273, "end": 300, "text": "McKendrick between 1910 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 301, "end": 305, "text": "1930", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 444, "end": 473, "text": "(Kermack and McKendrick 1927)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1759, "text": "(Milton 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1760, "end": 1775, "text": "(if applicable)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Modelling Infectious Disease Spread"}, {"text": "Population (compartmental) models of infectious diseases break down the population into compartments that represent, over time, the populations of various distinct disease states. We have already encountered the term susceptible, which is one such compartment that includes anybody who could be infected if they came into contact with an infectious host. Infective is another such compartment, which is populated by hosts capable of transmitting the disease to susceptible members of the population. To complete one of the most basic compartmental models of epidemic behaviour, the SIR (susceptibleinfective-recovered) model, we introduce a recovered compartment, which includes those removed from the susceptible population, as they are now immune to infection. The sum of the three compartments is the total size of the population (Fig. 15.4) . In the SIR model, the force of infection, \u03bb, is modelled as the contact rate (number of contacts one person makes with other people per unit time) multiplied by the fraction of the population that is infective (Fig. 15.4) . This captures the logical idea that susceptibles coming into contact with many people are increasingly likely to encounter an infective host as the number of total infectives rises. The rate of recovery, \u03b3, is assumed to be constant in the usual formulation of the SIR model. These epidemiological parameters can be combined to yield a powerful descriptor for the transmissibility of an infectious disease, which combines the population characteristics and behaviour with the communicability of the pathogen. This is the basic reproduction number, R 0 , which is the expected number of people an infective would infect in an otherwise fully susceptible population. For sustained transmission and an epidemic to occur, R 0 in an SIR model and other similar models must be greater than one. There are various derived terms with their foundations in the basic reproduction number, such as effective R 0 (R\u2032 is a measure of reproduction number contingent on the existing immune fraction of the population) and R t (a measure of reproduction number as an epidemic progresses over time). Table 15 .3 provides R 0 values for some key historical pandemics and other epidemic diseases. The basic SIR model contains a set of assumptions that render it suitable for certain classes of disease model, but deserve closer scrutiny when considering real-world disease outbreaks. One such assumption is that, once exposed, an individual will immediately become infective. Often, there is a latent period where the levels of pathogen are building up in the host and during which the host is not yet infective. This is termed the exposed compartment, and its effects are demonstrated in Fig. 15 .5. In both the SIR and SEIR deterministic models, for a disease with R 0 > 1, the number of infectives (the effective case- 1.0-6.5 a HIV R 0 estimated using a basic method and based on experience in Uganda from 1996 to 2008 load in these models) undergoes exponential growth until it reaches a peak, after which the number of susceptibles available to infect has significantly diminished, resulting in an inflection point where caseloads begin to fall. Similarly, the formulation of the rate of recovery implicitly assumes that recoveries are exponentially distributed, whereas in reality, other distributions (including those with low variance) of recovery times are typical. Various methods have been proposed and used in tackling this issue, including separating the infective compartment into a sequence of sub-compartments, yielding gamma, normal and delta-distributed recovery times as the number of infective compartments is increased (Wearing et al. 2005) . 6 Another pair of assumptions is that the populations are effectively infinite and the compartments are perfectly mixed. These assumptions may be reasonable approximations to the truth during the peak and late stages of a large epidemic or pandemic. However, consider the case of a novel pathogen. The basic deterministic SEIR model's initial conditions are based on the concept of Fig. 15 .5 Simple deterministic SIR and SEIR models for smallpox, displaying populations of each compartment relative to the total population. A total of 10 \u22124 of the total population is infective at t = 0 in an otherwise fully susceptible population. In the SIR model (upper), there is no latent period: susceptibles move directly from susceptible to infective. The SEIR model (lower) incorporates this latent period and yields different dynamics closer to what is seen in smallpox and many other epidemics D. Smith a well-mixed proportion of the population starting as infective, whereas in the real-world scenario, there is a single person (index case) that is infective. The subsequent course of the disease will depend on the behaviour of that person and the local characteristics of the population in that area. Thus, while the R 0 may be less than or greater than one when assuming the population is perfectly mixed, whether an epidemic will happen will be uncertain and dependent on a small number of human interactions during these early stages of an outbreak. Introducing demographic stochasticity to the model can improve the realism of this feature (Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000) .

Such models can range from the relatively simple where the coupling is homogeneous and requires only minor extensions to the compartmental models described above, to the complex. Heterogeneous coupling and network models of detailed population dynamics such as commuting and travel patterns can be taken into account in such models.

This development and subsequent developments of other vaccines using the same fundamental immunological principles has perhaps saved (or extended) more lives than any other single medical innovation in history. Vaccines remain the most powerful tool used by public health practitioners to protect populations against transmission of epidemic diseases. One caveat of the use of vaccination is that, by definition, a vaccine will not be available for an emerging infectious disease. Some prior biological material from the pathogen or a close relative (e.g. deactivated virus particles) is required to develop a vaccine, and these either will not exist or will not be known at the early stages of an outbreak. Recent experience from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic indicates that a time period of 5-6 months is required from first isolation of the novel virus to availability of the first batches of influenza vaccine (World Health Organization 2009). During this interval, depending on the transmissibility, a large fraction of the world population may have already been infected.

While the antibiotic does not directly have any impact on viral load, in historical pandemics such as 1918, very large numbers of deaths have been attributed to secondary bacterial infections, such as bacterial pneumonia (Morens et al. 2008) . Modelling the effect of antibiotics over the course of such a pandemic can be done as follows: (i) assess antibiotic efficacy against secondary bacterial infections in the infected individual, yielding proportion of mortality reduced per secondary infection; (ii) multiply this by the proportion of secondary infections that occur; (iii) compare against the baseline of the primary infection case fatality rate.

Therefore, data on the zoonotic reservoir of the disease can be useful in estimating future pandemic frequency. Influenza viruses circulate among animal, notably avian and swine populations. Where swine or poultry is kept in closely confined conditions and where viral strains that may be common in animal populations in other regions are introduced to a new region, the chance of reassortment is increased. Close human contact with animals, for example, sleeping in close proximity or frequent manual handling can increase the chance of a novel pathogen being transmitted to humans. We can, therefore, use proxies derived from these principles to gain insight on the probability of reassortment occurring and its transmission to humans.
