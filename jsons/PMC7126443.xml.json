Stormwater has been considered as an alternative water source for both potable (drinking) and non-potable uses (gardening, landscaping, and irrigation) (McArdle et al., 2011; Page et al., 2014c; Page et al., 2015). There are several advantages to using stormwater, including (i) reducing demands on the urban potable water supply (ii) diversification of water supplies (iii) reducing discharge of untreated urban stormwater to urban streams and marine outfalls. Despite these advantages, stormwater has not been widely adopted as an alternative water due to a perceived lack of information on the presence and risk from microbial and chemical contaminants.",

            "text": "The chemical quality of stormwater has been reviewed and indicated the presence of numerous contaminants including heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated aliphatics, halogenated ethers, monocyclic aromatics, phenols and cresols, phthalate esters, nitrosamines, pesticides, and other organics, especially in urban and/or industrialized areas (Makepeace et al., 1995; Eriksson et al., 2005; Baun et al., 2006; Huber et al., 2016). Risk assessments of chemical contaminants in stormwater have suggested that in some cases, contaminants may exceed concentrations in the environment that are relevant for ecological endpoints, but may be lesser contributors to human health risks (Eriksson et al., 2005; Baun et al., 2006; Eriksson et al., 2007). Non-carcinogenic risks due to ingestion of fish in stormwater-contaminated waterbodies have been identified as a potential concern (Bickford et al., 1999). Iron levels exceeding Australian guidelines and elevated (but below guideline) levels of Arsenic have also been identified as potential risks for managed aquifer recharge with stormwater, with overall chemical risks from various compounds posited to be low (Page et al., 2010a, Page et al., 2010b). Heavy metals and pathogens are thought to be the drivers of human health risks for exposure to stormwater (Page et al., 2010a, Page et al., 2010b, Page et al., 2010c, Page et al., 2010d; Chong et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2016). Indeed, public perception of microbial risks, in particular, remains a crucial barrier to the expansion of water recycling and reuse (Higgins et al., 2002). Therefore, the current review will focus on microbiological contaminants in stormwater and their associated risks.",

The pathogens present in various animal fecal sources will differ from those in sewage (Schoen and Ashbolt, 2010; Soller et al., 2015; Federigi et al., 2019), and therefore stormwater is likely to contain a different pathogen profile than sewage. Studies have reported a high prevalence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and enteric pathogens in stormwater (Noble et al., 2006; Rajal et al., 2007; AWQC, 2008; Sidhu et al., 2012a; Cizek et al., 2008). The microbial quality of water is assessed by FIB such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enterococcus spp. (USEPA, 2000). These indicators are abundant in the intestine of warm-blooded animals, and their presence in waters indicates fecal contamination and the likely presence of potential pathogens.",

Another limitation of FIB is that they cannot provide information regarding the sources of fecal contamination (Field and Samadpour, 2007; Stoeckel and Harwood, 2007). Remediation strategies can be more effectively implemented if the potential sources of fecal contamination and pathogens are known in stormwater (Sidhu et al., 2012b). Since the monitoring of FIB in water does not provide information on origin, e.g., human or animal feces, researchers have developed a set of analytical tools collectively known as \u201cmicrobial source tracking (MST) tools.\u201d These tools can be used to obtain information on whether the fecal contamination in water came from human or animal wastewater or both (Harwood et al., 2014).",

Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize the concentrations of traditional and alternative fecal indicators, MST marker genes and potential pathogens in stormwater runoff and outfalls. A section of this review has been dedicated to summarizing available quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs) for potable and non-potable uses of stormwater. The focus for reviewing available QMRA models is to summarize the types of assumptions used to model pathogen fate, transport, and exposure in order to identify data gaps and areas where further attention is warranted. Additionally, a review of fecal indicators and pathogen log removal values (LRVs) through Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) or Best Management Practices (BMPs) of stormwater runoff has been compiled. Finally, risk mitigation approaches and the most critical research gaps are identified concerning the public health aspects of stormwater reuse.",

The elevated FIB concentrations generally occur at or just before the peak inflow of the storm hydrograph. Stumpf et al.

The authors reported 30 and 37 times greater loadings of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. in storm flow compared to base flow. E. coli and Enterococcus spp. were weakly correlated (r\n2 = 0.13 to 0.32) with total suspended solids, while strong associations (r\n2 = 0.40 to 0.78) were observed between FIB and streamflow rate and various stages (base, rising, peak and falling) of the hydrograph.

The urban site had the greatest level (E. coli 7.39 log10 MPN/100 mL; fecal streptococci 7.21 log10 CFU/100 mL) of FIB concentrations compared to agricultural site (E. coli 2.51 log10 MPN/100 mL; fecal streptococci 2.48 log10 CFU/100 mL) because of runoff from commercial markets and impervious cover, sewer and septic overflows. The authors noted intra-event variability of FIB across the monitoring sites. FIB concentrations increased during the peak flow and then decreased as the storm progressed. Levels of FIB significantly (p < 0.05) varied between early and late summer seasons with higher FIB concentrations observed in early summer. Anthropogenic activities and impervious cover were found to influence positive correlations (r > 0.6) between FIB numbers and environmental parameters such as temperature, turbidity, and total suspended solids.",

However, some E. coli strains such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (E. coli O157:H7 or other EHEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and others are pathogenic to humans and can be used for risk estimation purposes. Although these subsets are not routinely measured, general FIB can be used as a preliminary screening tool prior to testing for other pathogens. Additionally, ratios of FIB to pathogens are used occasionally for risk assessment purposes (Petterson et al., 2016).",

Untreated sewage poses the greatest risks to humans and the environment due to high concentrations of enteric viruses (EC, 2000; Fong et al., 2010; Soller et al., 2010). Sewage may be introduced into stormwater through illicit connections, cross connection between sewer pipes, storm drains and leakages into sewers through broken lines or poor pipe joints (Pitt, 2004). The presence of sewage in stormwater can be problematic due to the likely co-presence of pathogens. Identifying the presence of sewage in stormwater using is not straightforward due to dilution, infiltration, and lack of sensitive detection methods (Panasiuk et al., 2015). However, microbial source tracking (MST) marker genes are used to identify human feces and other sources of animal fecal contamination such as cattle, dogs, pigs, and birds in water (Harwood et al., 2014; Ahmed et al., 2016).",

Concentrations of these marker genes were one to three orders of magnitude higher (4.04\u20135.59 log10 GC/L of HB and 4.04\u20136.27 log10 GC/100 mL of Lachno2) in stormwater samples during storm events compared to low flow periods (3.53 log10 GC/100 mL of HB and 3.71 log10 GC/100 mL of Lachno2). A further increase in the order of a magnitude of marker genes was observed during the combined sewer overflow (CSO) event compared to storm events.

Information on the concentrations of pathogens in stormwater is needed for risk assessment and management for beneficial reuse. However, the data on the occurrence and levels of pathogens in stormwater runoff is limited. This is because collecting stormwater samples during storm events can be challenging. Grab samples are easy to collect, and the cost associated with sampling is low, but only represent a snapshot of the water quality at the time of collection (Harmel et al., 2010). Automated samples are more accurate and appropriate for stormwater sampling as they collect representative samples. However, it has to be installed at a specific location, requiring construction of infrastructure and regular maintenance. Other factors such as the presence of high concentrations of suspended solids, grease and PCR inhibitors make it difficult to detect pathogens with molecular based methods (USEPA, 1999; Stenstrom et al., 1984; Rajal et al., 2007).",

Epidemiological studies observe patterns of disease in conjunction with environmental exposure and provide inferences rooted in observed health outcomes, and for this reason are highly valuable for assessing health risks. The findings of several epidemiological studies have supported a relationship between stormwater exposure and waterborne illness for stormwater-impacted waterbodies (Haile et al., 1999; Colford Jr et al., 2007; Soller et al., 2017). However, due to the study sizes and expense required to achieve predictive power in epidemiological studies and difficulty attributing risks to a particular exposure source and/or pathway, often QMRA approaches are used to assess risks where effect sizes are projected to be small due to low environmental concentrations. QMRA uses a process of hazard identification, exposure assessment, dose response analysis, and risk characterization to predict the risk of an infection or disease- related outcome based on an exposure to environmental media (Haas et al., 2014). To the author's knowledge, there has not been an epidemiological study for potable or non-potable uses of stormwater resources. However, studies by Ashbolt and Bruno (2003) and Soller et al. (2017) have demonstrated the utility of combining both epidemiological and QMRA information where feasible for stormwater-affected waterbodies.",

Several (n = 16) QMRA studies have relied upon concentrations of pathogens observed in stormwater-impacted coastal, recreational waters, or drinking source waters for assessment of health risks (Donovan et al., 2008; Soller et al., 2010; ten Veldhuis et al., 2010; Fewtrell et al., 2011; Tseng and Jiang, 2012; Andersen et al., 2013; McBride et al., 2013; de Man et al., 2014; Sales-Ortells and Medema, 2014; Schoen et al., 2014; Soller et al., 2014; Adell et al., 2016; Krkosek et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2017; Soller et al., 2015; Soller et al., 2017), and two have used other modelling approaches for microbial health risks such as Bayesian network modelling (Goulding et al., 2012) or disease transmission models (Soller et al., 2006). These recreational water QMRAs are reviewed in detail by Federigi et al. (2019). However, few studies have conducted a QMRA for potable and non-potable reuse exposures to stormwater (Table 3). The focus on potable and non-potable uses here is due to the difficulty of comparing recreational exposures with multiple non-point as well as point sources of contamination with stormwater-only exposures. Stormwater-impacted recreational waterbody exposures using FIB as well as pathogens as index pathogens were very high in some cases, up to 1.0 for a homeless population ingesting Giardia, for example (Donovan et al., 2008). The risks from potable and non-potable uses of stormwater in Table 3 varied substantially depending on the target pathogen and exposure scenario. Risks were considered highest for viral pathogens, in most cases exceeding risk benchmarks for potable and non-potable use with the exception of toilet flushing in some cases (Lim et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2017). The studies summarized in Table 3\nindicate that potable and non-potable exposures to stormwater are likely to exceed water quality targets [e.g. up to a geometric 240 CFU/ mL for recycled water (USEPA, 2012b)] and risk benchmarks (10\u22124 probability of infection or 10\u22126 disability adjusted life years per person per year (pppy) in the absence of additional treatment and/or BMPs depending on the area, end use, and source water. Microbial risks from harvested rainwater are considered as captured stormwater but have been reviewed elsewhere (Hamilton et al., 2019).",

Once concentration values are obtained, values can be corrected for recovery efficiency in a QMRA, however, low or variable recovery efficiencies can also complicate QMRA analysis. Furthermore, concentrations observed at the point of exposure may not be indicative of realistic exposure scenarios over time as they typically are not observed after a rainfall event during presumably peak pathogen concentrations, or dilution occurs at the point of exposure that in some cases will render concentrations of pathogens below the analytical detection limit (McBride et al., 2013). These factors must be taken into account when constructing QMRA models. Previous studies of pathogens in stormwater discharges have relied upon small samples sizes (Sidhu et al., 2012a, Sidhu et al., 2012b; McBride et al., 2013; Sales-Ortells and Medema, 2015), limiting the ability to capture the large variability in stormwater pathogen concentrations due to potentially diverse fecal contamination sources (human and multiple animal fecal wastes, affecting the types of index pathogens chosen for the QMRA), rainfall patterns, decay rates, and other factors.",

(2013) confirmed that variability in pathogen concentration is indeed high between rainfall and baseline events. There is therefore a need to look at a scenario-conditional risk estimate (sometimes referred to as \u201cconditional risk\u201d), rather than averaging or annualizing over time without regard to rainfall events. Pathogens can survive on urban surfaces and building materials, for example, and could furthermore be introduced into stormwater during subsequent rain events without the presence of an ongoing fecal source. This further supports the need for comparison of stormwater wet-weather risks with dry event (baseline) risks (Taylor et al., 2013).",

In lieu of a detailed hydrodynamic or fate and transport models for pathogens, simplified assumptions of decay and dilution between a pathogen source and human receptor are often made. Dilution factors are sometimes applied to estimate pathogen loads between stormwater and receiving recreational bodies; for example, McBride et al. (2013) used a 30-fold dilution factor applied to the concentrations of pathogens observed in stormwater discharges. Other studies have applied an estimated microbial decay factor for particular pathogens or indicators as surrogates for pathogens in stormwater, sometimes also coupled with a dilution factor (Petterson et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2015). The use of hydrodynamic mixing and inactivation models such as those applied by Andersen et al. (2013) could be used to obtain more accurate site-specific dilution information, or a distribution of dilution factors could be incorporated into a Monte Carlo approach in QMRA models as performed in Soller et al., 2017.",

These assessments show that there are non-trivial risks associated with the use of stormwater resources to supplement water portfolios and in some cases guidelines are not sufficient to mitigate risks (Murphy et al., 2017). This is needed as stormwater harvesting areas can create new opportunities for co-mingling of potential animal habitats or reservoirs for animal fecal material and human recreational environments, where transmission of fecal pathogens can occur (Sales-Ortells and Medema, 2015; Petterson et al., 2016). While acknowledging the utility of QMRA, caution must be exercised when comparing risk estimates from QMRAs employing different methodologies. For example, a direct comparison of annual infection risks and annual disability adjusted life years (DALYs) (pppy) should be interpreted carefully as these methodologies can lead to different risk conclusions when compared to guideline values (Lim et al., 2015). Furthermore, it has been suggested that drinking water benchmarks could be too stringent for comparison with alternative water uses in some cases and warrants consideration of the development of more applicable guideline values (Mara, 2011; Schoen and Garland, 2015).",

WSUD approaches often use a \u2018treatment train\u2019 where a series of treatment approaches are used to meet stormwater objectives. The approaches applied will depend upon the catchment characteristics, climate conditions and discharge requirements. Often the initial stages of a WSUD treatment train will focus on the removal of coarse sediments, which can help improve the treatment effectiveness of subsequent stages that use filtration and/or biological processes. In addition to the WSUD treatment approaches summarized below, non-structural catchment-scale approaches can be used to improve quality of runoff discharged to receiving waters (Wong, 2006). This can include buffers around waterways that limit potentially polluting land uses, and the revegetation of riparian zones. For example, Bryan et al. (2009) described the use of an adaptive management framework to reduce Cryptosporidium risk in an agricultural catchment in South Australia.",

Most studies have employed FIB to derive the LRVs of microbial removal in specific WSUD treatment processes and as such, and there is much less information on the removal of specific pathogens such as viruses and protozoa which have very different physico-chemical characteristics. A range of factors have an impact on the treatment capability of WSUD systems. The removal of pathogens varies from system to system and therefore, it may be useful to assess individual systems in-situ to account for local variability resulting from factors such as sedimentation, sunlight exposure, water temperature, and adsorption/desorption with biofilms (Jiang et al., 2015). Peng et al., 2016 highlighted that most microbe focused studies of stormwater biofilters focus on FIB, which are measured by culture-based methods, and less frequently by molecular based methods. These studies may be difficult to extrapolate to pathogens. There are few studies on the removal of pathogens, particularly viruses, in stormwater by biofiltration. Peng et al. (2016) also noted the need for more studies that use field-based measurements, rather than laboratory settings, as it captures the more variable and complex features of the urban environment that influences how effective WSUD approaches are likely to be in reducing pathogen loads.",

The authors concluded that the ability of BMPs to reduce FIB varies widely within BMP categories. No single BMP appears to be able to consistently reduce FIB in effluent to levels below instream primary contact recreation standard.

While there is variability in the removal capacity of the different reported WSUD systems, in general all of these systems achieved 0.5 to 1 LRV for FIB and the bacterial pathogen Campylobacter. The results also show that bacterial removal is faster (or higher) than viral and protozoan pathogens, which tend to be more resistant to treatment processes, and therefore more able to survive through the different WSUD treatments. This is due to the differences in size surface characteristics, mode of reproduction and life cycle of viruses and protozoa which are different than those of bacteria (Hoff and Akin, 1986). In general, sequential treatment systems with a series of ponds, wetlands or combinations tend to improve pathogen removal from source water. For example, Reinoso et al. (2008) evaluated the removal of a variety of traditional and alternative fecal indicators such as coliphages, total coliform, E. coli, fecal streptococci and C. perfringens and pathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. from domestic sewage in a treatment train including pond storage followed by surface and subsurface wetlands, with the overall Cryptosporidium and Giardia removal efficiency found to be as high as two log10. A new potential WSUD treatment component currently being studied is the addition of heavy metal (e.g., copper) labelled zeolite to filtration bed media. Laboratory research has demonstrated that copper coated zeolite can have LRV capability for bacteria such as E. coli greater than three log10 (Li et al., 2012). Stormwater can also be contaminated with viral and protozoan pathogens, both of which have higher treatment requirements than bacteria. However, the information on the effect of zeolites coated with heavy metals on these enteric non-bacterial pathogens is very limited. Silver/copper coated zeolites could reduce coronavirus by 2\u20133 LRVs (Bright et al., 2009) and silver-impregnated filtration pots reduced Giardia and Cryptosporidium by at least 96% (~1.5 LRV) (Adeyemo et al., 2015). More research would be needed to assess the treatment potential of copper-coated zeolite on a range of enteric viruses and protozoa under in-field conditions before its use could be justified as beneficial for the cost, particularly for the removal of pathogens.",

Use of wetlands and bio retentive systems can also assist in reducing high loads of organic matter (e.g. leaf fall) as well as removing nitrogen and phosphorus through phytoremediation. Additional levels of treatment are often required to manage human health risks, where stormwater from a sewered residential catchment is used for public, open-space irrigation (e.g. in schools and sporting ovals). Here, human health risks can be managed by the use of on-site access controls to minimise exposure to irrigation water.

These accepted default LRV tables can be then used along with catchment specific knowledge where possible exposure controls are used to determine the required level of treatment for pathogens. For example, Page et al. (2012) reported that risks from viruses have the highest required LRV targets and if they are met then protozoan and bacterial LRV targets will also be met. It was reported that for open space irrigation requires <2.0 LRV is sufficient for stormwater recycled via an aquifer and this can potentially be managed using chlorination and exposure controls. However, if in the same system where stormwater is recycled via an aquifer were to be used for drinking water, a LRV of 5.5 would be required to manage human health risks from viruses (Page et al., 2014c). Generally these default LRVs apply where there has been no stormwater catchment-specific assessment of the health risks posed by the quality of the stormwater.

This will provide additional information on the human health risks associated with stormwater from point and non-point sources of fecal contamination. Identifying and quantifying sources of human sewage in stormwater is most important followed by cattle due to the presence of a wide array of enteric viruses and zoonotic pathogens in these sources.\u2022The concentration of pathogens in stormwater, outfalls and receiving environmental waters can be high, especially in urban areas. Monitoring of traditional FIB takes 24\u201348 h and does not provide real-time information on the quality of recreational water. This is important from a human health perspective. Swimming area closure causes economic losses. Therefore, it is recommended that a rapid pathogen monitoring toolbox and standardized methods need to be developed that are able to quantify a number of reference pathogens in waterbodies with increased accuracy, reliability, and less technical training under various conditions. The toolbox can be used either in the laboratory or in the field to provide a rapid assessment whether the stormwater from a particular storm event presents a hazard to public health.\u2022Most of the stormwater quality monitoring studies focused on determining the concentrations of pathogens in urban stormwater. However, more data is required on the concentration of pathogens in stormwater sourced from a range of land uses. While sewage discharges are relatively well characterized, there remain gaps in our understanding of runoff from nonpoint sources. More studies are required to determine the concentrations of zoonotic pathogens in stormwater.\u2022Fecal contamination in stormwater is largely dependent on the land uses and mostly include sewage, septage and various animal feces. Therefore it is imperative to determine the sources of contamination. This will in turn provide a basis for cost-effective remediation and information on the immediate human health risks in stormwater impacted waters. Currently used FIB monitoring approaches are inadequate due to their presence in both human and animal feces. An MST toolbox comprised of various human and animal feces-associated marker genes needs to be employed which will allow managers to quickly identify the relative contribution of point and non-point sources of fecal contamination.\u2022The quality of stormwater in terms of microbial contaminants is poorly understood. Microbial risk will be the dominant acute health risks on stormwater reuse due to the risk of waterborne pathogens (Hrudey and Hrudey, 2014). However, in some cases, chemical risks may be the driving health concern and relationships between multi-contaminant exposures should be explored. Few QMRA studies addressing potable and non-potable exposures to stormwater were available. Most of the QMRA studies are based on conservative assumptions. More data are required on the concentrations of pathogens and recovery from water samples across sites and stormwater hydrographs. In addition, improved understanding of the influence of catchment characteristics and baseline levels of pathogens, meteorological factors, and decay of pathogens is required for accurate QMRA estimates.\u2022Different types of WSUD and BMPs are able to reduce microbial contamination, however, reliable information is still lacking on the performance of these treatment barriers. Standardized natural treatment validation protocol needs to be developed. Most studies determined the efficacy of WSUD or BMPs on the removal of microorganisms using FIB, while one or two studies investigated the LRVs of protozoa pathogens such as Cryptosporidium spp. or Giardia spp. Given the differences in size and characteristics of different groups of pathogens, it is unlikely that FIB LRVs will be representative for pathogens especially enteric viruses. Therefore, studies should focus on determining the removal of enteric viruses and other pathogens (i.e., bacterial and protozoans) of interest to determine the removal rates through different types of WSUD and BMPs, simultaneously. These data will be important for evaluating the effectiveness of WSUD/BMPs for reducing microbial contaminants in the receiving environments and can support improved QMRA models. The evaluation will focus not only on the performance of individual component of WSUD/BMPs but also on a series of different types of BMPs.\u2022Little is known regarding the decay of pathogens in stormwater or outfalls, and the relative differences in persistence between FIB, pathogens, and host-associated markers. As stormwater becomes aged, pathogens will start to decay and as result, the human health risks will also decrease. Studies should focus on determining the decay of pathogens in stormwater and outfalls or recreational water contaminated with stormwater. In-situ decay studies are preferable over laboratory microcosm studies where it is difficult to mimic real world scenarios.\n",

However, human and environmental health risks associated with stormwater need to be assessed carefully. This is due to the presence of fecal pollution and associated pathogen in stormwater that are capable of causing illnesses in humans. The research gaps discussed in this paper and other uncertainties associated with the performance of stormwater treatment systems needs to be investigated. Health risks can be assessed using a QMRA analysis, thus facilitating decision-making and risk management efforts. This may, in turn, increase the confidence of regulators and public health managers for adopting stormwater practice widely.",
