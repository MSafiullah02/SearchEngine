Retrospectively, 135 prehospital and 100 hospital personnel reported symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure. Fortunately, none required emergency treatment.1,\n2 Eleven physicians caring for the sickest victims (including one in cardiac arrest and one in respiratory arrest) were most affected, and six of them required antidotal therapy. Fortunately, all recovered fully and did not have to cease their patient care efforts due to symptoms.3 Approximately 80% of victims self-referred to hospitals, which is consistent with U.S. experiences indicating that few victims of chemical contamination events undergo decontamination before arrival at a medical facility.2,\n4 This has caused most jurisdictions to reconsider historical plans that contaminated patients would not be in contact with medical care personnel until they were \u201cclean.\u201d EMS and hospital personnel need to be prepared for contaminated patients presenting directly to them and to recognize that in certain situations, PPE may be required to safely provide care.",

The report, titled \u201cProtecting Emergency Responders: Lessons Learned from Terrorist Attacks\u201d describes in detail many of the challenges responders faced (Box 36-1\n).8\nBOX 36-1HISTORICAL HAZARDS FACED BY RESPONDERS TO TERRORISM EVENTS\n\u2022Physical hazards including fires, burning jet fuel and explosions, rubble piles with sharp rebar and heated metal, falling debris (which resulted in the death of a nurse in Oklahoma City), hazardous materials, electrical hazards, structures prone to collapse, heat stress, exhaustion, and respiratory irritants\u2022Heat-related seizures while wearing chemically protective suits\u2022Eye injuries (usually related to particulate exposure), which accounted for 12% of all WTC disaster response worker injuries\u2022Potential for secondary hazards, including explosive devices and chemical, biological, and radioactive agents\u2022PPE shortcomings:\u25cbHeavy helmets hindered performance\u25cbSelf-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) was heavy and cumbersome\u25cbSCBA face pieces fogged (reducing visibility), and the equipment hindered verbal and radio communication\u25cbSCBA air bottle made it difficult to enter small spaces, and the limited air supply (up to 1 hour) necessitated leaving the operation to exchange the air bottle\u25cbAir tanks and/or filters were not interchangeable between teams, and teams worked under different standards\u25cbPowered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) filters became clogged and were uncomfortable for long duration use. Many workers instead opted to use dust masks (which offered little protection and caused nose-bridge chafing) or to wear the masks/hoods around their necks (\u201cneck protectors\u201d)\u25cbUse of respirators made it difficult for workers to communicate with each other, often resulting in users breaking the face seal to talk\u25cbTurnout gear (the common protective garments used by firefighters) increased heat stress and physical fatigue\u25cbAt the WTC, the rubble pile was so hot in places that it melted the soles of workers' boots; providing wash stations to cool the boots resulted in wet feet and serious blisters for many workers; some 440 WTC disaster response workers sought treatment for blisters\u25cbSteel-reinforced boots (soles and toes) protected against punctures by sharp objects but conducted and retained heat, which contributed to blisters and burns\u25cbStructural firefighting gloves worked well until they got wet and hardened, reducing their dexterity\u25cbWTC disaster response workers did not consistently protect their hands against potential hazards such as human remains and bodily fluids\u25cbSafety glasses were readily available but often were open at the sides and did not offer adequate protection against airborne particles\u25cbGoggles were uncomfortable, hindered peripheral vision, tended to fog, and did not fit well in conjunction with half-face respirators\u25cbMany disaster response workers at the WTC (especially law enforcement officers) did not consistently use hearing protection, even around heavy machinery, because they needed to hear their radios and voices and listen for tapping when they were searching for survivors\n\u2022Most volunteers at the WTC, Pentagon, and Oklahoma City did not receive pre-event training on PPE and hazardous materials\u2022Although firefighters generally received detailed pre-event training, this was less true for law enforcement officers\u2022Accurate \u201creal-time\u201d hazard information was not readily available, especially during the anthrax incidents\u2022Protection from falls was available at some sites (in the form of ropes and harnesses) but was inconsistently used\n",

The numerical score determines the gravity of each threat to the community. Each community's HVA will reflect the unique risks that must be considered by its emergency responders. Choice of PPE may be affected by factors within the HVA such as:\u2022Population density of the community and surrounding area\u2022High- or moderate-risk terrorist targets in the community (e.g., government buildings, centers of commerce, or another symbolic site)\u2022Chemical hazards posed by community industry (e.g., use of cyanide and hydrofluoric acid in the electronics industry)\u2022Risk of transportation incidents and major transportation routes, particularly highways and railroads\u2022Proximity of healthcare facilities, schools, or other key locations to these potential targets and industrial and transportation hazards\u2022Frequency of hazardous materials (HazMat) incidents in the community\u2022Resources available to respond to HazMat incidents (e.g., rapid access to on-site decontamination may decrease, but not eliminate, contaminated persons leaving the scene)\n",

No provider required hospital admission, and no chemical PPE was used. Other reports of emergency department evacuation and/or provider illness due to off-gassing from contaminated patients have been summarized.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 The most serious of these incidents involve patients with suicidal ingestions of organophosphate pesticides.14, 15, 16 Exposures to these patients caused at least one provider to require intubation and receive aggressive antidotal therapy due to contact with pesticide in emesis and vapors during patient resuscitation.14 Patients who have ingested organophosphate may off-gas for days and present an ongoing risk to healthcare workers.16 NIOSH has documented 46 healthcare worker injuries from pesticide agents between 1987 and 1998.14 In conjunction with the information from the Tokyo subway sarin attack and the chemical terrorism risk posed by these agents, it is clear that these pesticides present a substantial risk of toxicity from secondary exposures.",

Generally, as the level of protection increases (A being the highest level), so do the weight, cost, and physiological burden. Increasing protection also generally means decreasing mobility, dexterity, and scope of vision. Inherent risks to PPE include trip and fall hazards; a reduced ability to complete tasks; heat stress19,\n24, 25, 26, 27; anxiety28; and seizures, which, although rare, have been reported.19 Cardiovascular demand is dramatically increased as ensemble weight and heat retention increase. PPE must be selected on the basis that it does not impose unnecessary risks on the provider while at the same time offering an appropriate margin of safety against the chemical hazard. Because the selection of PPE usually revolves around the selection of the respiratory component, various types of respirators must be reviewed. Each respirator has an assigned protection factor that reflects the degree of protection afforded to the user. Simply put, 1/protection factor equals the amount of exposure for the wearer. For example, a provider wearing a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 1000 is exposed to 1/1000 the level of contaminant as compared with wearing no protection.",

Technology change is occurring far more rapidly than the current approvals process and new standards that have arisen in the wake of the events of 2001. Clear guidance on appropriate technologies for warm zone activities is lacking at this time. This can lead to confusion and difficult choices for agencies and facilities, knowing that their PPE selection may be either too much or too little to satisfy future standards. Currently, there is no recommendation or consensus on the level of PPE that is required for hospital-based personnel, much to the consternation of hospital preparedness leaders. Some have proposed a PPE level \u201cH\u201d to meet this need. More research is clearly needed regarding safe but comfortable PPE, methods of decontamination, modeling of airborne concentrations of specific agents, and PPE selection.",
