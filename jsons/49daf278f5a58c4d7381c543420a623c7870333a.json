To induce cholesterol-laden endosomal compartments and lipid droplet vacuoles, A549 cells were treated with 2 \u03bcg/ml U18666A (Sigma) and 0.2 mM Oleic acid (Sigma), respectively.

Also, total-, free-and esterifiedcholesterols were quantified using Cholesterol Quantification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacture's instruction. To quantify colocalization of proteins, the Pearson's correlation coefficients of the different fluorescent signals were determined with the NIS-Elements Advanced Research (AR) imaging software, version 3.22.11 (Nikon Instruments Inc. Melville, NY) based on the pixel density and overlap of two-color signals. The mean \u00b1 SD of the Pearson's correlation coefficient value was calculated based on more than 20 cells and the metric values were presented in each image. To calculate the intensity of the Nile Red staining, more than 20 cells were analyzed using the NIS-Elements AR software. To monitor replication of GFP-VSV and GFP-IVA within infected A549 cells, GFP fluorescence signal was captured by immunofluorescence microscopy (Olympus 1X71 Inverted Microscope).",

(H) A549-Vector, A549-IFITM3 and A549-IFITM3 \u0394TM2 cells were infected with GFP-VSV and GFP-PR8 influenza virus (MOI=1.0). After two days postinfection, cells were photographed using fluorescence microscopy (magnification: 10x). (I) A549-Vector, A549-IFITM3 and A549-IFITM3 \u0394TM2 cells were subjected to viral single-entry assay using defective MLV-EGFP pseudotyped with envelope proteins of VSV, IAV H1N1 (PR8), and IAV H3N1 (Udorn). Values represent mean \u00b1 SD, n \u2265 3 independent experiments. (J) Bacterially purified GST or GST-VAPA proteins were mixed with OSBP-containing cell lysates together with IFITM3-, IFITM3-CD4-or IFITM3-TR-containing cell lysates. After 2 hours incubation at 4\u00b0C, GST pull-down (GST PD) and IB were performed with the indicated antibodies. WCLs were used for IB with the indicated antibodies. Related to Figure 5.

R. White-embedded cells were subjected to immunolabeling with anti-VAPA antibody and 15nmgold particle-conjugated secondary antibody. The black arrows indicate ER localization of VAPA and the white arrows indicate endosomal localization of VAPA. Scale bar: 0.2\u03bcm. (E) TEM images of ultrathin sections of epon-embedded A549-Vector cells were captured. Scale bar: 2\u03bcm. (F) TEM images of ultrathin sections of epon-embedded A549-VAPA cells were captured.
