Two of those articles are included in this issue of 50 the Journal. 1,2 Marcus Shaker, Matt Greenhawt, and 19 other experts from around the United States 51 have provided a very extensive guide to contingency planning during this unprecedented crisis. 1 Their 52 comprehensive Special Article covers a wide range of relevant topics, including clinical background 53 regarding COVID-19 infections, prevention and control measures for healthcare workers, the 54 implications of emergency social distancing on ambulatory allergy/immunology care services, and 55 specific guidelines regarding each of the conditions allergist/immunologists commonly treat. This article 56 also details methods and policies on how to use telemedicine/telehealth services as a safer alternative 57 to in-person visits. In an excellent Editorial, Jay Portnoy and colleagues provide additional perspective, 58 guidance, and resources for incorporating various forms of telemedicine into allergy/immunology 59 practice during the current pandemic. 2 60 61 In addition to publishing articles, JACI: In Practice hosted a special edition of our Virtual Journal Club on 62 April 1, during which authors Marcus S.
