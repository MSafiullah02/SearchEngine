The development of methods for identifying drug uses based on phenotypic data can improve the efficiency of drug development. However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications based on cell picture data. This work reported one state-of-the-art machine learning method to identify drug uses based on the cell image features of 1024 drugs generated in the LINCS program. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by non-experimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. The analysis of feature conversion shows that different features play important roles in identifying different drug functions. For the current COVID-19, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine achieve antiviral effects by inhibiting endocytosis, etc., and were classified to the same community. And Clomiphene in the same community inibited the entry of Ebola Virus, indicated a similar MoAs that could be reflected by cell image.",

In addition to drugs that can directly interact with viruses, a large number of drugs may exert antiviral effects through host targets. For example, chloroquine can inhibit the endocytosis of COVID-19 by changing the intracellular environment, increasing the intracellular PH value, etc., so as to achieve the antiviral effect; and some drugs targeting the cell pathway may produce anti-Coronavirus effects (Antiviral potential of ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling modulation for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection as identified by temporal kinome analysis).",

            "text": "Due to the virus invasion, replication and release are highly host-dependent, therefore, analyzing the effect of drugs on cells is very important to find effective antiviral drugs. Transcriptome, proteome data and other information are the direct influence of drugs on intracellular molecules, which is very helpful for the discovery of new uses of drugs. However, due to the complexity of the image data itself and the fact that it does not directly reflect the molecular characteristics, it is still difficult to use the image data for drug function discovery despite its relatively low cost. In this study, by analyzing the image data of 1024 drugs acting on cells, the mode of action of the drugs was found. In terms of mechanism of action, 1024 drugs represent more than 300 different mechanisms of action. Fewer samples and more classifications make it difficult for machine learning methods to effectively use these data for action pattern identification. Because the multi-dimensional features of the image are affected by nonexperimental factors, the characteristics of similar drugs vary greatly, and the current sample number is not enough to use deep learning and other methods are used for learning optimization. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] As a consequence, this study is based on the supervised ITML algorithm to convert the characteristics of drugs. The results show that the characteristics of ITML conversion are more conducive to the recognition of drug functions. In this paper, 1105 drugs are analyzed by clustering algorithm in machine learning. At the same time, this paper also uses a variety of data preprocessing methods to improve the clustering effect. In data preprocessing, this paper compares Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm and metric learning algorithm and in data clustering we use Affinity Propagation (AP) algorithm. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Therefore, we adopted the ITML algorithm to achieve the identification of drugs with similar mechanisms by optimizing the measurement of drug image features. Compared with the original data and PCA without the ITML algorithm, this method can help to identify drugs with similar mechanisms. For the enrichment analysis of drug types with a sample size exceeding 5, it is found that 39 clusters were enriched with 604 types of drugs, suggesting that a variety of cell features may be used to discover the mechanism of action (MOA) of the drug.",

At the same time, when the categories of data increase, the former training model needs to be retrained under the new categories, which will cause a lot of resource and time consumption. Therefore, deep learning method is often limited in practical application. As a kind of machine learning, metric learning can solve this problem well. It makes the similarity between the same type of data increase, and the similarity between different types of data decrease.

They can all appear in category 21. The CSIFs of the drugs in the cluster include Nuclei_Intensity_IntegratedIntensity_Mito, Nuclei_Texture_InfoMeas1_Mito_3, and so on. The result indicates that their common mechanism is related to the DIP after they act on the cells. The other drugs in the cluster are not the same as the known mechanisms of action of these drugs, suggesting that they may also have similar effects. The other drugs contained in cluster 21 have different mechanisms of action. These DIP-like drugs may have similar effects in antiviral. The MoA of Clomifene in cluster 21 is annotated as Estrogen receptor antagonist, which has been found to be resistant to Ebola, suggesting that it may have a similar mechanism of action. The image data after the drug acts on the cell is one of the most easily obtained screening data. Judging the potential effects of drugs from images has great application value. Here we use the cell characteristic data processed by professional cell image processing software (cellprofiler) to predict MoA. Due to the complex MoA of drugs, we use third-party MoA annotation data and optimize the metrics based on ITML. The optimized cluster is more closely related to the known MoA. Next, we found that the clustering results based on image features are closely related to the MoA of the drug itself. Such as Tubulin inhibitors, CDK inhibitors and Microtubule inhibitors can inhibit the formation of spindles, and they are simultaneously classified into cluster 20. The COVID-19 drug candidates chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and the anti-Ebola drug clomiphene appeared in cluster 21 at the same time. Although their MoA annotations are different, they can inhibit the entry of the virus, and on multiple image features Have similarities. These results confirm the possibility and accuracy of drug discovery based on cell image data.
