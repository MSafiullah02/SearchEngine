            "text": "The mortality rate is the most important factor that determines whether a highly infectious disease becomes a public concern and carries risks causing a pandemic. Different virus epidemics take place throughout the world every year, but only a few rise to the level of public concern (Schlagenhauf and Ashra, 2003; Viboud and Simonsen, 2012; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), swine influenza A H1N1 virus (H1N1), and Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola) brought on the public's attention because they caused many severe infections and thousands of deaths (Dawood et al., 2012; Nicholls et al., 2003; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014). Similarly, the disease COVID-19 caused by a coronavirus (2019-nCoV) brought world-wide attention and caused public panic because many deaths had been reported without being put in the context of the many mild infections and its potentially low case fatality rate (Chan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). For example, despite being a common infection, influenza rarely causes public concern because even though it is common, it leads to death in only 0.1% of cases. A variety of reports indicate that 2019-nCoV is highly infectious through multiple routes (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). While the high infection rate is certain, the mortality rate of COVID-19 has not been definitively determined. It is reasonable to suspect that the deaths of six of the first 41 patients (15%) in Wuhan (Huang et al., 2020) in the earliest reports by Chinese scholars were inaccurate. When the initial mortality rates were reported, only patients who were critically ill were included. Patients with mild symptoms, as well as those with asymptomatic infections, were not analyzed (Chen et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Case-fatality rates reported by Huang et al. (2020) analyzed a skewed patient sample since it included only a small number of patients who had been transferred from other hospitals due to their critical condition. Therefore Huang et al.'s sample was skewed towards a concentration of severely ill patients, while the general patient population includes more patients with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms and who have not been hospitalized. Chen et al. (2020) reported an 11% death rate, again based on patients with severe conditions.",

The PIBA uses patient data in real-time to build a model that estimates and predicts death rates for the near future. PIBA uses data of patients identified early in the disease process to calculate the average number of days from hospitalization to death for those hospitalized. Another feature is to take into account variations based on mathematical models. The PIBA calculation method does not divide the total number of patients on a day by the number of deaths on the same day. Instead, the PIBA calculation method divides the number of deaths on that day by the number of possible patients of a day or days when the patients have just begun to develop the disease.",

As time goes on, large amounts of data from northern and southern China have been accumulated through continuous reporting, all of which are used by PIBA, which then becomes more accurate as data accumulates. We conclude that it is time to utilize the accumulated data to estimate the case fatality rate of COVID-19 infection. Based on national data from the China National Health Center, the COVID-19 death rate is much lower than that reported in Huang et al. (2020). Holistic data covering all of Wuhan, the epicenter city of COVID-19, also indicates a death rate lower than that reported by Huang et al. These data sources cover a larger patient sample, and include patients displaying symptoms with varying levels of severity. Therefore, the updated estimation of the death rate should reference these larger scale and more representative data.",

Because of this, we were not able to prove the feasibility of this method in more regions in mainland China. However, because the environment, medical conditions, and population races in different countries are different, to test the usefulness of the PIBA model in other countries, we need to get the basic information of the initial population. This information includes the specific number of days from onset to death of a reasonable number of patients in different regions of different countries. At present, we could not access these data accurately. The only thing we can do is to test Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan based on their ethnic similarities with populations in China. Taking all aspects into consideration, we believe that South Korea's data are more reliable. Therefore, we further tested our model using the affected population in South Korea. As shown in Fig. 5\n, the trend of deaths in South Korea in recent days is consistent with our prediction.",

This real-time accurate prediction and estimation of disease mortality provide the public, government, and society with more accurate disease information. Based on currently available data that includes patients with varying degrees of severity, the estimated prediction of the mortality rate of COVID-19 is less than 3%, and less than the prior prediction based on limited available data. This finding may ease public concern and panic. Updated scientific findings will be widely disseminated to broaden public awareness and contribute to helping fight COVID-19. The medical, clinical, and research community should strive to publish scientifically rigorous findings related to urgent public health issues. Publishing findings based on the availability of limited data contributes to unnecessary public concern and government action. In this particular case, the first report on the estimation of coronavirus death rate is an applaudable effort. However, it also had the limitations of a skewed dataset that focused on patients who were transferred from local hospitals because of their critical condition while excluding patients with less severe symptoms who remained at local hospitals. As soon as more data are available, we should provide updated reports and introduce improved estimation and prediction algorithms.",

One of the most obvious questions is why the mortality rate in Wuhan is considerably higher than in other places. Based on our assessment, Wuhan's medical equipment and rescue measures are comparable with other areas in China, and the pathogenicity of the virus is similar. We conclude that there is a large proportion of patients in Wuhan who have mild illness and not been hospitalized at all. Due to the uncertainty of the movement of infected people in the early stages of the onset, these mildly ill people move around in Wuhan unidentified. This problem reminds other parts of the world that if the fatality rate of the COVID-19 is found to be high, a large number of infected people have not been able to be identified or diagnosed. Therefore, the work of controlling and isolating this infected group has not been completed, and the disease is still spreading and circulating in the area.",

With the development of the generations of 2019-nCoV, its toxicity will gradually weaken, and we expect that the mortality rate in the cold northern regions will not increase, nor will it exceed that in Wuhan or Hubei Province.",

The second aspect is the accuracy of the number of patients diagnosed and the number of hospitalizations per day. Due to the back and forth revision and correction of the data as announced by the official sources, we are not confident that all the data are error-free; however, we feel that these data as a whole are reliable. The third limitation of the PIBA method is that it depends on accurate patient information at the beginning of the epidemic.
