Questions were posed: were associates and dental practice owners reaching a stage that significant numbers were going to either give back their NHS contracts, spend more time on private dentistry and fail to meet their UDA targets or in other ways provide less NHS care? How many junior hospital dentists would walk away from hospital careers and opt for specialist private practice? The community dental services workforce was highlighted as ageing, would they increasingly opt to retire early or resign from part-time posts? Would all of this happen in sufficient numbers to start to create real workforce shortages and impact on access to NHS care?",

Contract reform sits at the top of that pile. Little wonder -it is approaching nine years since the Department of Health in England began piloting and prototyping new contractual arrangements in England. It has been a long and testing process, and only last October the BDA reported the end could be in sight, with a degree of certainty known about dates that were being committed to. 1 Not quite. Further waves of prototypes were anticipated -although unconfirmed -to be taking place from April 2020.

But, as with so many other areas, government lockdown gives us the time to reflect whether that will or should happen. With many economists expecting a global recession, is NHS dentistry doomed, or is there one last lifeline? Access is now the worst it has been for a decade, with just half of adults undergoing regular checks. Ten years on from the recession and austerity, the current economic climate does not bode well for the future of a service being funded on fumes and goodwill. In October last year, for the first time in a decade, dentists in England received an uplift close to inflation levels. The Department of Health and Social Care confirmed that the annual uplift for 2019/2020 of 2.42% would be backdated to April 2019.",
