Of note, delays in diagnosis are still among the most commonly cited reasons for delays in therapy in health care.8",

It also identified an opportunity to improve staff awareness of the OCH Severe Sepsis Management Protocol, which had been put into practice 1 year earlier. Several months later, New York State mandated the reporting of hospital sepsis data. These events prompted 2 systemic changes: the creation of a separate Sepsis QA Committee and implementation of a cloud-based alert system operating through the hospital\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) (St John Sepsis: Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, Mo.). Nurses would now be automatically notified if their patient\u2019s data met pre-established criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or sepsis. This system was limited by its triggers, which were based on adult sepsis research. Of note, no structured sepsis education accompanied these changes.",

Feedback from physicians, nurses (RNs), respiratory therapists (RTs), and advanced practice providers (APPs) helped inform the development of a needs assessment by these champions to describe practitioner knowledge, attitude, and behavior better. Knowledge was assessed through the creation of 7 clinical vignettes by the principal investigators (PIs). Each vignette provided a case stem, including examination findings and pertinent laboratory values, and prompted respondents to indicate if patients met the criteria for sepsis (or not) or septic shock (or not). Criteria published by Goldstein et al14 served as the standard for accuracy (see Supplemental Digital Content 1 at http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A166). To aid with content validity, the PIs piloted the vignettes with 10 pediatric providers (3 faculty physicians, 3 RNs, 2 RTs, and 2 APPs) with at least 5 years of inpatient experience in an outside tertiary care enter. Likert items were provided for participants to indicate their level of comfort with recognizing sepsis and septic shock and the frequency with which they hesitate to bring sepsis/shock concerns to their care teams.",

The first tier was electronic, with the creation of a \u201cSevere Sepsis\u201d order set in the EHR and a \u201cStop Septic Shock\u201d portal on the OCH intranet. The order set pre-selected antibiotics, intravenous fluids, laboratory tests, and supportive care options aligning with the OCH Severe Sepsis Management Protocol. The webpage allowed users to access management protocols and their supporting literature and institutional sepsis epidemiologic data. It also would archive the newly minted sepsis e-newsletters, prepared by the PIs and emailed to staff quarterly. These contained Sepsis QA committee updates, tips and strategies for management, and quizzes for staff to use to assess their understanding of the material. The second tier was dedicated to visual marketing, with colored posters depicting sepsis screening and recognition tips and strategies placed throughout the hospital. Smaller versions were printed on identification badge-sized cards and distributed to staff. Laminated copies of the OCH Severe Sepsis Management Protocol were also placed at each nursing station and code cart. The third tier focused on active education through sepsis drills: 15-minute, low-fidelity simulation sessions facilitated by physician, nursing, and respiratory care champions. The target audience was ED, PICU and ward residents, RNs and RTs\u2014those providers spending the most time at the bedside. These sessions were unscheduled, with the only stated goal of at least 1 drill per unit per month. Facilitators could engage their audience at a bedside or nursing station whenever they deemed appropriate, without the need for a manikin or other operating equipment. Instead, they presented a laminated card containing 1 of 15 clinical scenarios developed by the PIs (see Supplemental Digital Content 2 at http://links.lww.com/PQ9/A167). Attendees were prompted to diagnose and articulate a management strategy, after which facilitators offered several preordained take-home points. Staff attendance was recorded. Multiple facilitators were assigned to each unit to capture both day and night practitioners.",

These drills emphasized sepsis content prioritized by the OCH respondents to our baseline needs assessment: reinforcement of diagnostic criteria, strategies for timely, bedside recognition, and identification of resources needed for prompt therapeutic intervention when indicated. Previous studies of individual provider groups (eg, resident physicians) have shown that structured educational modules\u2014including those incorporating simulation\u2014can increase sepsis knowledge and positively influence practitioner behavior.15,16 Simulation exercises and other means of \u201cactive participation\u201d education have also been shown to improve coordination of care and affect practice change in pediatrics.17\u201319 However, the combination of this provider-centric strategy with a broader, institution-wide, multidisciplinary approach, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described. This multi-tiered methodology does make it difficult to ascertain what proportion of the improvements seen might be attributable to the sepsis drills as opposed to the poster campaign, EHR order set, screening cards, or e-newsletters. Post-intervention survey data (eg, the significant increase in vignette performance irrespective of drill participation) do suggest an impact of these other elements, especially considering the decrease in the number of drills performed after 3 months. Therefore, our results likely speak to the potential impact of a coordinated, multi-tiered strategy.",

As previously described, sepsis knowledge\u2014as indicated by vignette performance\u2014significantly increased post-initiative, as did the proportion of respondents indicating comfort with calling attention to evolving cases of sepsis or septic shock. There was also an association between knowledge and comfort, with \u201ccomfortable\u201d respondents answering, on average, more vignette questions correctly. This observation may be explained by the fact that providers who are better able to identify sepsis or septic shock are more confident in their suspicions and thus more comfortable reporting them to the care team. Interestingly, while \u201cmore knowledge\u201d appeared to be associated with more comfort in raising concerns, it was not associated with less (self-reported) hesitation to do so. The lack of a difference in vignette performance between \u201chesitators\u201d and \u201cnon-hesitators\u201d suggests this behavior is influenced by more than mere comprehension. Perhaps the concerns reflected in the Likert items\u2014inspired by pre-implementation focus group feedback\u2014such as worry over the clinical implications of labeling a patient as septic (eg, additional venipunctures for lab work) are substantial enough to override providers\u2019 instincts. It is also possible that respondents with \u201cmore knowledge\u201d are hesitating for reasons other than their peers. For example, they may be overanalyzing cases and reluctant to call attention because their suspicions do not technically meet all necessary criteria. Future study is warranted, especially given the strong association between hesitation and refusal to raise concerns identified in the post-intervention survey.",

The simulation sessions and both surveys excluded neonatal, obstetrical, and surgical providers, given the nuances of sepsis particular to these patient populations. These exclusion criteria may, however, limit the generalizability of the results. Our evaluation strategies may also have introduced certain confounders. Vignette performance may not be the best surrogate for knowledge, and gains made could be due to the intervention better \u201cpriming\u201d post-implementation respondents to recognize question patterns. If so, this may or may not be practically relevant, insofar as providers were still better able to make a cognitive association (eg, between viral, as well as bacterial infections, and the development of septic shock physiology). Knowledge improvements may also have been due to better clarity of the questions, although this was unlikely given that case presentations kept the same format. A post-initiative influx of providers well-versed in sepsis and septic shock could theoretically have impacted the results. Assessments of comfort and hesitation via Likert items may not be optimal, and all behavioral evaluations were based on self-reporting. Finally, we implemented this initiative after we established a Severe Sepsis QA Committee; the New York State\u2019s Department of Health began mandating hospital outcome reporting, and we instituted a cloud-based EHR alert system. All of these may have raised awareness and impacted OCH sepsis culture. However, all pre-initiative survey findings were obtained with these factors already in place.",
