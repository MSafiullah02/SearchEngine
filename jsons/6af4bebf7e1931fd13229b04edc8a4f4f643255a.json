These interventions have been reported to save lives and improve patient quality 116 of life 26 and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this role is relevant in augmenting efforts 117 being made by other members of the healthcare team to ensure patient safety and wellbeing. 118Although different practice models relate to pharmacy, the concept of pharmaceutical care was 119 proposed and instituted in the mid-1970s to represent general services in patient care where the 120 patient is the primary beneficiary of the actions by pharmacist 27 . The role of pharmaceutical care is significant for people with chronic illnesses and is particularly relevant during this 122 COVID-19 pandemic period where many people have various medicines-related concerns. The 123 concept has also been relevant for community practice where services and functions of 124 community pharmacists in promoting and supporting rational medicines use and counseling is 125imperative 28 . 126In providing pharmaceutical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of community 127pharmacists will be on the prevention, identification and/or resolution of drug therapy problems128 for patrons to their facility. Community pharmacists are ideally positioned for this role because 129 they are the most accessible group of health practitioners during this COVID-19 pandemic to 130 address the substantial issues of inappropriate use of and promote rational use of medicines to 131 people in the community as well as to special populations like patients with chronic conditions 132 29,30 . Some pharmaceutical care practices that have been effective in improving patient 133 outcomes for a number of chronic diseases includes the provision of appropriate drug 134 information and counseling on chronic medications, making essential medicines available, 135 addressing polypharmacy and medication safety concerns, assessing medication needs, 136 promoting adherence and providing follow-up services 31-36 . 137 138 Pharmaceutical care and chronic disease management during COVID-19 pandemic 139 The pharmaceutical care practices of community pharmacists for patients with chronic diseases 140 during the COVID-19 pandemic are outlined (Figure 1): 141 Information and communication about COVID-19 142 Most countries have been forced to lockdown their major cities and restrict movement within 143 such cities. This restraint has led to many patients relying on community pharmacies for their 144 medication needs and health information 37 . Patients with chronic diseases may want to know what to do with their management and medicines during this pandemic. While community pharmacists play key roles in educating patients on preventive measures and the pandemic in 147general, providing adequate health information on chronic diseases and its management will 148 directly address the concerns of patients in this category who may be confused and worried 149 about their health. These patients may also have questions about medicines to take during this 150 period and the community pharmacists can also serve as \"information verification hubs\" to 151 clarify the various remedies being advertised on media platforms for the prevention or treatment 152 of COVID-19.",

The community pharmacy will therefore be the most patronized health facility for people to 186 either seek for or verify these recommended therapies. Examples of these popular remedies187 include hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, preparations with high doses of vitamin C, garlic 188 capsules, lemon tinctures and apple cider vinegar. Community pharmacists are thus tasked with 189 the role of providing information on the authenticity of these claims to promote rational use of 190 medicines. For patients with chronic illnesses especially, who are likely to be taking their 191 prescription drugs, wrongful uptake of information translating into irrational use of these other 192 social opinionated remedies might lead to drug interactions with their routine chronic medications 38 . In addition, the proper use of over-the-counter medications for managing simple ailments of common occurrence in patients with chronic illness also need to be monitored by 195 community pharmacists. By playing their traditional roles of counselling patients on their 196 medications, the contribution of community pharmacists in supporting rational use of medicines 197 during this COVID-19 pandemic will be emphasized. 198 199 Promoting medication adherence 200 Reiterating the need for patients with chronic disease to adhere to their medication regimen has 201 been emphasized by community pharmacists, with evidence of improved outcomes from their 202 interventions 39 .
