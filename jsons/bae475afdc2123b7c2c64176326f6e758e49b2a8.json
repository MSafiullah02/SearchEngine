First, I present an overview of the types of problems that have been handled in the fields of bioethics and medical ethics in Japan since the 1980s. I begin my discussion in this era because modern bioethics began its development in Japan in the early 1980s. I divide this time period (beginning in the early 1980s until around 2020) into three parts, corresponding to Phase I, Introduction: 1980-1999; Phase II, Development: 2000-2010; and Phase III: the Recent Past (2011-present) . No significant distinction is intended between use of the terms \"bioethics\" and \"medical ethics.\" For full description, refer to references [1] [2] [3] . This chapter is a brief summary of those three papers and some further considerations.",

Beginning in the 1980s, nationwide debates began as to whether brain-death constituted human death, and whether organ transplantation from a brain-dead body should be permissible. These issues were discussed in medical circles, religious groups, political groups, the media, and among the general population. With the establishment of a commission on braindeath, and the 1997 enactment of the Organ Transplantation Law, organ transplantation from a brain-dead body was finally deemed permissible, with strict conditions. Specifically, the clear and written expression of the intent to donate from the organ donor (15 years or older) as well as the family's consent were both required. Politically, this marked a major milestone. Several positive outcomes were achieved, including discussion on the definition of death and Japanese views on life and death; this set a healthy tone for how bioethical arguments should be handled in Japan from that point forward.",

Informed consent in the clinical context entails an act in which \"medical caregivers provide sufficient explanation to those with sound judgment capacity and ensure that the patient understands, while the patient then offers consent of their own volition.\" Today this is considered common protocol, but such was not always the case in Japan. There was even extensive debate on how to translate the English term \"informed consent\" into Japanese; today, the term \"infomudo konsento\" is used, but is presented in katakana, the phonetic alphabet used for foreign terms and names. In the course of this discussion, those arguing to protect patient autonomy, basing their arguments on self-determination and the right to know, were in a dominant position. Others countered that argument, stating that prioritizing individual autonomy so heavily is unsuited for Japan. However, an explanation of the patient's condition has now been systematically added to the treatment plan at the time of hospital admission and discharge, such that it is covered by health insurance [4] . Informed consent is therefore a common theme that has been integrated into medical care. This flow of events necessitated a change in paternalism among physicians. It also led to the medical record disclosure system based on the Private Information Protection Law in 2003.",

In this case, a physician, in response to a clear request from the patient's family, administered potassium chloride (KCl) to a terminal cancer patient [5] . He was found guilty of murder and given a suspended sentence by the Yokohama District Court in 1995. The trial was an unprecedented case in which a doctor performed euthanasia. As the court decision presented the conditions that would allow for active euthanasia in the obiter dictum, it was erroneously relayed to other countries that active euthanasia was legally permissible in Japan. Reports of physicianassisted suicide emerged from abroad, and terms such as euthanasia, mercy killing, and dying with dignity were used without clarity. Currently in Japan, the act of a medical caregiver administering muscle relaxants or KCl to a patient, leading to the latter's death, carries with it a high probability that the medical caregiver will be placed on trial for murder. Notably, unlike several other countries, Japan has not legalized active voluntary euthanasia. In addition, with the increased popularity of hospice or palliative care, fewer cases of \"withholding treatment\" requested ahead of time by patients are legally problematic. However, the issue of \"treatment withdrawal\" (removal of an artificial respirator) from a terminal patient has yet to be subject to legal resolution (see Chap. 4).",

            "text": "In the second phase, topics in medical ethics shifted to issues pertaining to the beginning of life. Among them, the heightened discussion surrounding the moral status of the human embryo became particularly significant. At this time, research on embryonic stem cells (hereafter, ESCs) had become widespread. Human ESCs have the capacity to differentiate into all kind of tissues and all cell types, and there was great hope for these cells in the field of regenerative medicine. However, in order to create human ESCs, one must destroy a fertilized egg (embryo) that has the capacity to become a human individual in the future. If one perceives that human life is present in an embryo, then this type of use of embryos cannot be approved. In 2004, the Council for Science and Technology Policy and the Experts Panel on Bioethics compiled the document \"Basic Principles Concerning the Handling of Human Embryos.\" This document stated that the human embryo is not a person per se, but it is also not an object. The document instead uses the phrase, \"sprout of human life.\" The writers conclude that a human embryo is worthy of respect and requires careful handling (see Chap. 5). Fundamentally, \"The Guidelines for Derivation and Utilization of Human Embryonic Stem Cells\" and \"The Act on Regulation of Human Cloning Techniques\" take the same stance as \"The Basic Principles Concerning the Handling of Human Embryos.\" Given that the moral status of the human embryo is a topic of deep religious and political debate in other countries, it seems that Japan has actually handled this issue with relative ease. However, it remains a mystery as to why abortion-another debate that should be begging many questions about the moral status of an individual prior to birth-did not gain as much momentum as that surrounding the human embryo.",

Many of these were drafted by governmental review boards or committees. These drafting sessions came to include medical and legal specialists as well as ethicists, and representatives from the general public such as journalists. By this time, a new framework had been put in place for policy-making in the fields of life sciences and medical care. This was a linear process that began with forming a public committee comprising specialists from many disciplines, drafting the guidelines, implementing the public comment system, and publishing the final results on the internet, followed by media reporting and revisions over several years. This framework reflected the nature and process of the debate surrounding organ transplantation from brain-dead donors.",

However, in 2000, the first graduate level Department of Biomedical Ethics was established at the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, and several full-time faculty members were hired. In 2003, the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine also created a Department of Biomedical Ethics.

It has been defined as an \"intervention aimed to improve the human form and function more than is necessary for maintaining health or recovery\" [6] . A more straightforward definition is set forth by Kato, a Japanese philosopher, who defines enhancement as \"employing medical technology for a purpose other than treatment.\" Examples of enhancement include the administration of growth hormones for children who are not suffering from growth restriction, \"doping\" or the use of steroids to enhance muscle strength in sports, and the use of mind-altering drugs such as Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) by healthy individuals to enhance their attention (learning capacity) or mood (\"smart pills\" or \"happy pills\"). In the future, we may be dealing with designer babies due to genome editing, increased longevity, and enhancement using a brain-machine interface that can operate machinery by connecting a brain to a computer. Ideas to improve humans are not new, but developments in medical technology now present the possibility of altering the human body, which has led to many debates surrounding the ethical issues involved. Those opposed to enhancement are concerned about its widespread use, advocating that it is unnatural for human beings to \"play God,\" that there are unknown dangers, and that we would lose sacred values such as the importance of weakness and being interlinked with one another. Meanwhile, those whose stance is one of the passive promotion, that is \"so long as each individual's freedom to choose is respected we cannot go so far as to prohibit this,\" are in favor of enhancement, as are those who actively promote it based on utilitarian principles, arguing that enhancement promotes the happiness and enjoyment of human beings, and thus we are obligated to pursue it.",

This field has come to be known as \"neuroethics.\" Safire defines neuroethics as \"the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain\" [7] . Two major developments in neuroscience aided in creating momentum for neuroethics. First, the development of brain functional imaging technology such as PET and fMRI made it possible to observe the brain functions of a living human being. This new technology presents the possibility of obtaining an even more diverse array of information, such as lie detection and clarifying an individual's level of consciousness. However, it also opens up possibilities for mind-reading, or the ability to read the condition of another person's spirit. The second major technological development involves selective pharmacological and anatomical intervention/manipulation of neurological processes. For example, it is now possible to control tremors caused by Parkinson's disease with Deep Brain Stimulation. This technology could potentially be applied to patients with other diseases. Moreover, it could also be used for brain enhancement in healthy people. Brainwashing and mind control for military purposes have also come into the debate.",

Currently, iPS cell research has moved from the basic research stage to drug development and even clinical applications such as cell transplantation.

Due to groundbreaking developments in genomic medicine, the time will come when at the time of our birth (or indeed at conception), we will know our genetic destiny. This raises many serious ethical issues. For example, if it is discovered at birth that a child would develop a severe disease by the age of 10, what sort of care should that child receive? What would we do if we found out that we would develop dementia by the age of 50? Would we be tested early on and take preventive drugs? Adults may have the capacity to make these sorts of decisions, but the ethics of administering these tests to underage individuals is not as clear. Is testing justifiable in children if the intent is to prevent disease or slow its progression? Should genome editing be conducted, ensuring that the genes causing disease are eliminated prior to birth? Alternatively, is this an area into which humans should not intervene? This would change the nature of medicine entirely. Similar issues are raised by the development of artificial intelligence, as implementation of this technology may change the physician's role markedly. Currently, in an age in which progress has been realized in genomic medicine, precision medicine will likely become one of the most difficult ethical dilemmas for mid-twentyfirst century medical care.",

            "text": "Having touched on the history of bioethics in Japan, I will turn to some issues for the future. First, I anticipate that the life sciences and medical technology will continue to progress further, giving hope to many suffering from currently incurable diseases. Some of the developments, such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors, iPS cells, and ESCs, are technological innovations that may help to overcome conventional ethical problems. However, as is evident in issues related to enhancement and neuroethics, forward progress in medical technology that hides within itself great possibilities can, on the one hand, give us great hope for the development of new treatments, while also creating friction between conventional values and ways of living, causing anxiety in society. Moreover, when technology is first introduced, it is difficult to envision sufficiently the influence it will have. How should society handle the \"uncertainties\" that inevitably and constantly accompany these new technologies? Constructing a framework to ensure that these are addressed effectively is one major challenge for the future of medical ethics in the Japanese context. In addition, even if the arguments in medical ethics shift over to those concerning the beginning of life against the backdrop of new technological developments, issues with terminal medical care and end of life will continue to cause worry among patients and their families, as well as among medical caregivers involved in treatment.",

Thus, the framework required to address these issues, while befitting the Japanese context, also comprises an effective method that listens to external voices and adjusts to create harmony in society in order to resolve ethical issues in life sciences and medical care. Yet, I cannot help but assume that the excessive use of 1.4 The Future of Bioethics in Japan guidelines and laws creates a dependency among medical caregivers and researchers, such that they lose the motivation to face problems head-on and think deeply about them, or when necessary, communicate to the outside world about issues.",

Indeed, the demand not only to accomplish all they do in their busy workday but also to tackle these ethical issues is a tall order. However, we cannot assume simply that because laws and guidelines are in place, all problems will be resolved quickly. If we hope to resolve these ethical issues, we must take a multifaceted approach that is both policy-based (guidelines are issued, ethics committees are established, and healthcare systems are improved) and education-based (awareness and problem-solving capacities are increased among medical caregivers and researchers in those fields as a result of medical ethics education). This is what I envision for bioethics in Japan.",

If I do not do this, my concern is that international trust and confidence in Japan's research and medical care will deteriorate over time, and the value quality of Japan as a nation will decrease. This is not a lack of patriotism. As noted in the Introduction, the present book was written to achieve a global scale of bioethical dialogue; to this end, I cannot shy away from criticism of my own country's policies or cultures in this process when this is necessary.",
