Insects usually react against introduced foreign bodies, such as the eggs of parasitoids, by hemocyte-mediated encapsulation. Consequently, endoparasitic insects have evolved different strategies for overcoming these reactions (Vinson, 1990) . In some cases avoidance of encapsulation is simply passive, whereas more often, parasitoids actively disorganise the host immune system by different substances either injected by the adult parent at the time of oviposition or directly produced by the parasitoid larva (Lavine & Beckage, 1995) .",

The calyx of the ovaries of different taxa within the superfamily Ichneumonoidea shelters replication of specific Polydnaviruses (Fleming, 1992) . Several members of this family have been extensively studied since their discovery in the 70's. Polydnaviruses help the parasitoid avoid encapsulation by either altering or eliminating host haemocytes (Strand & Pech, 1995) . In 1982, Edson, Barlin & Vinson described virus-like particles (VLP), not from the ovaries, but from the venom apparatus of two out of the nine braconids they studied. More recently, Lawrence & Akin (1988) confirmed that the venom glands of one of these wasps, Diachusrnirnorpha Zongicauduta (Ash. j, contained two VLP's that morphologically resembled Entomopoxviruses and Rhabdoviruses. These viruses are also suspected to help the parasitoid suppress host defence mechanisms (Rolle & Lawrence, 1994a,b) . Although a venom apparatus is present in all female braconids (Edson & Vinson, 1979) , its function in species which are not known to paralyse their hosts remains largely unknown.",
