In this document, we discuss these privacy issues in more detail and introduce approaches for building a contact tracing application with enhanced privacy guarantees, as well as strategies for encouraging rapid and widespread adoption of this system. We do not make explicit recommendations about how one should build a privacy-preserving contact tracing app, as any design implementation should first be carefully vetted by security, privacy, legal, ethics, and public health experts. However, we hope to show that there exist options for preserving several different notions of user privacy while still fully serving public health aims through contact tracing apps.",

Consider injecting random noise by augmenting the data with artificial tokens. Whenever Alice and Bob send information to Grace (either in the form of a diagnosis report or a query), they can augment their tokens with random ones. Note that some care has to be taken in deciding which distribution to draw the random tokens from. Not only should the system keep the probability of spurious matches low, but the distributions should also be designed to make inferences by Grace difficult.",

In theory, Bob could augment his own tokens with a set of n random tokens {r i } n i=1 drawn uniformly from {0, 1} N , and send those to Grace as well. Unfortunately, N was chosen to prevent accidental collisions; this means that the probability that the additional random tokens correspond to the tokens broadcast by any individual is vanishing small. But then, there is actually little to no privacy gained. Grace can just assume that the augmented set of tokens correspond to Bob, and perform the same linkage analysis that she would with only the correct set of tokens. This does nothing but pollute Grace's database with extra data, without affording any real privacy gains for Bob. Similarly, Alice also cannot obfuscate her exposure through Bob from Grace, because any extra tokens she sends to Grace will not change the fact that she has Bob's token as one of her contacts.",

Instead of hiding true tokens with random noise, suppose the system includes a set of M honest-but-curious non-colluding \"mixing\" servers not controlled by Grace that aggregate data before forwarding it on to Grace. When Bob is diagnosed with COVID-19, he partitions the tokens he wishes to send (depending on the setup of the system, either his own tokens, or those of his contacts) into M groups, and sends each group to one of the mixing servers. The mixing servers then combine Bob's data with that of other users diagnosed with COVID-19 before forwarding it onto Grace. Similarly, Alice does the same thing for querying, except she also needs to wait on a response from the mixing server for each of the tokens she sends. The linkage problem then becomes much more difficult for Grace, because the valid tokens for individuals have been split up. Similarly, each mixing server only has access to a subset of the tokens corresponding to each individual, making the linkage analysis more difficult for them.

For example, in the version where Bob sends his own tokens B to Grace, Alice can download batches corresponding to her contact tokens\u00c2.

At a cost of more computation, however, we believe that a solution for secure contact tracing can be built using modern cryptographic protocols. In particular, private messaging systems [27; 28; 29] and private set intersection (cardinality) [30; 31; 32; 33] protocols seem especially relevant. The sketch we provide below is based on private messaging systems, though we do not claim this to be an optimal implementation. We will give the intuition here before going into technical details necessary for an effective implementation. First, we replace the random tokens (a t , b t ) exchanged by Alice and Bob with random public keys (pk A t , pk B t ) from asymmetric encryption schemes [34] . The matching secret keys are stored locally on each of Alice's and Bob's phones. Then, imagine that Grace has established a collection of mailboxes, one for each public key that Alice and Bob exchange. Additionally, we introduce Frank and Fred. Frank forwards messages to/from Fred. Fred forwards messages to/from Grace. They do not tell each other the source of the messages. At fixed time points after Bob's contact with Alice (up to some number of days), Bob addresses a message to Alice encrypted using the public key Alice gave Bob. Bob gives the message to Frank, who then forwards it on to Grace (through Fred), who puts it in Alice's mailbox. The content of the message is Bob's current infection status, and the reason he sends messages at fixed time points is to prevent Frank from figuring out Bob's infection status from the fact that he is sending messages. Alice checks all of the mailboxes corresponding to her last several days worth of broadcasted public keys. In one of the mailboxes, she then receives and decrypts Bob's message, and learns whether she has been exposed to the virus. Grace cannot decrypt the message Bob sends to Alice because it is protected by asymmetric encryption. Furthermore, to protect Alice's privacy, she can also access her mailboxes through Frank and Fred, who deliver the messages in Alice's mailboxes to her without Figure 1 : Overview of contact tracing based on private messaging systems. When Alice and Bob are near each other they exchange public keys as tokens. They then periodically encrypt (using each other's public key, followed by the public keys of the proxy servers) a message indicating their infection status, and send it to the proxy server. They also periodically query the proxy server for messages posted to the mailboxes corresponding to their public keys to find out whether they have been exposed to the virus. revealing which mailboxes she owns.",

This is a more sophisticated use of mixing servers than described in Section 4.3 for the polling based solution. When Bob wishes to send his encrypted message to Alice, he first encrypts it multiple times with public keys corresponding to each of the servers in the mix network. Because the messages are encrypted in multiple layers, and each server peels only the outermost layer, the final destination (Alice's mailbox) is revealed only to the last server, and only Alice can read the content of the message (i.e. infection status). To prevent Grace from learning the identity associated with each mailbox, Alice can also access her mailboxes through the mix network, which shuffles the traffic to decouple the mailboxes from their owners. As long as one of the servers is neither breached nor controlled by the adversary, the final message cannot be linked to a specific sender even if the adversary has full control of the rest of the network. Such a system for private communication could allow the users (Bob) to share their infection status with their recent contacts (Alice) while hiding the metadata of their contact patterns from the service providers. The involvement of non-government entities, such as an academic institution or a hospital, in the mix network may help increase users trust in the system and lower the bar for adoption.",

This loss of privacy from contacts can be partially alleviated by choosing a less frequent token refresh, so that with high likelihood, Alice cannot completely identify Bob by the time interval. Actual implementations much decide on the right tradeoffs between Alice and Bob's privacy from eachother and authorities, as well as contact tracing effectiveness. Another possible way to mitigate this problem would be to aggregate the messages for Alice on the server before making the results available to her. The messages are encrypted under different public keys, but it may be possible to use multi-key homomorphic encryption schemes [39; 40] which allow computation over ciphertexts encrypted with different public keys to sum up the count of 'infected' messages.

Though many techniques [36; 27; 29] have been proposed to address this challenge, further discussion among the stakeholders is needed to determine the suitable trade-off between the level of latency that can be tolerated and the level of privacy guarantees desired by the users. Ultimately, though, private messaging systems enable provable privacy from the authorities while still maintaining the usefulness of contact tracing.",

Having the app go 'viral' requires that people trust the app enough to install it and are enthusiastic enough to convince their friends to do the same. After all, app adoption must have a higher 'transmission rate' than the virus itself in order for it to be effective. Providing strong privacy guarantees would likely encourage voluntary adoption. Any app needs to clearly explain privacy guarantees in ways understandable by the average user, which was our motivation in describing here the different types of privacy (from snoopers, contacts, and the authorities) that the app should be able to provide to users in order to earn their trust.",

Lastly, we also do not build a full model for privacy of contact tracing, which is a delicate and easy-to-get-wrong task that requires much more careful research.

One additional concern which we have not addressed is that of nefarious actors seeking to spread panic by falsely claiming to be infected. This could be prevented by allowing only hospital workers to trigger the broadcast of infection status, as in Singapore's system, where the Ministry of Health directly contacts those exposed, though that of course trades away some of the privacy of diagnosed patients. Alternately, others have proposed cryptographic verification of contact events, which could perhaps be extended to infection event broadcast without giving direct access of tokens to the authorities [47] . However, given that some cities are already rationing testing kits and doctors' visits to only the most serious cases [48; 49] , restricting self-reporting might result in many instances of virus spread to be missed. Alternately, the system can also be designed to separate self-reports from confirmed reports by simply keeping two databases.",
