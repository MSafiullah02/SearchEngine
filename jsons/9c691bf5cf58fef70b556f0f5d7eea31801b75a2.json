Normally, the numbers of new infected cases mirrored the actual degree of transmission, while the numbers of new confirmed cases, often lagged the real situation by the existence of the duration between catching virus and being confirmed by testing.

If governors of states delayed one week, or more, for the resumption of businesses, that would significantly scale down the simulated magnitude of the second wave of the infection. But the benefit of delaying decision would be smaller and smaller when the current control policies continue to be effective. According to the report 22 , we consider the date of resumption of business for states of New York and New Jersey together. For the states of New York and New Jersey, since the average values of the estimated decreasing numbers of unidentified infected cases per 100,000 of adjacent Mondays in Extended Data Table 1 in the Supplementary Information were large (6.18 per week and 14.15 per week, respectively), there would be higher benefit for delaying the resumption of businesses. Meanwhile, the simulated numbers of cumulative confirmed cases per 100,000 in Fig. 4 were significantly higher than the projected case (22.44% and 60.18%, respectively) on May 11, implied considerable risks for the resumption of businesses before May 18.

To consider this nature of COIVD-19, it is crucial to evaluate the unobserved number of unidentified infected cases.

Compared with California state, the numbers of unidentified infected cases in the states of New York and New Jersey dropped faster after the peak, which was consistent with the estimated minima of for California). The details of estimated results for three states are given in Extended Data Figs 4-6 in the Supplementary Information. We considered the possible timing for resuming business in the forthcoming Mondays, i.e., May 11, May 18, May 25, June, June 8 and June 15. The predicted numbers of unidentified infected cases per 100000 for states of New York, New Jersey and California on May 11, May 18, May 25, June, June 8 and June 15 are given in Extended Data Table 1 in the Supplementary Information. Note that the estimated numbers of unidentified infected cases per 100,000 for states of New York, New Jersey decreased faster than California state.
