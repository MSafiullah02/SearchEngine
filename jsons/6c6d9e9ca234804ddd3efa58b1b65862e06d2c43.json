            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 21 200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of 22 April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has 23 extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 24 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities 25 within the Region of Murcia (Spain), a low prevalence area. Firstly, an aluminum 26 hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was tested using a porcine 27 coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The 28 procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10.90 \u00b1 3.54% and 10.85 \u00b1 2.11% in influent 29 water and 3.29 \u00b1 1.58% and 6.19 \u00b1 1.00% in effluent water samples for PEDV and MgV, 30 respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from 31 March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By 32 using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that 33 targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of 34 SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater waters of 5.29 log genomic copies/L 35 on average. Moreover, we tested as negative all secondary and tertiary treated water 36 samples, highlighting that current water disinfection treatments applied in the analyzed 37 WWTP are able to remove SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 38 This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at 39 municipality level, revealing that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating among the population 40 even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the 41 cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 42 wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this 43 strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population.

In brief, 200 mL of biobanked influent (n=2) 104 and effluent water samples (n=2) were artificially inoculated with PEDV and MgV.

The pH was readjusted 107 to 6.0 and sample mixed using an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 15 min at room 108 temperature.

However, as for SARS and 59 MERS, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool samples from patients suffering 60 COVID-19 and from asymptomatic carriers (1-5). The duration of viral shedding has 61 been observed to vary among patients with means of 14-21 days (6, 7), as well as the 62 magnitude of shedding varies from 10 2 up to 10 8 RNA copies per gram (1, 2, 8). 63 Infectious viruses deriving from fecal specimen have been cultured in Vero E6 cells and 64 observed by electron microscopy (9). In addition, gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelial 65 cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the release of the infectious virions to the 66 gastrointestinal tract supports the possible fecal-oral transmission route (10). Even though 67 the possibility of faecal-oral transmission has been hypothesized, the role of secretions in 68 the spreading of the disease is not clarified yet (6, 7, 9, 11). 69 Wastewater monitoring has been a successful strategy pursued to track chemical and 70 biological markers of human activity including illicit drugs consumption, 71 pharmaceuticals use/abuse, water pollution, and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance 72 genes (12-15). Viral diseases have been also surveilled by the detection of genetic 73 material into wastewater as for enteric viruses (16-18), re-emerging zoonotic hepatitis E 74 virus (19, 20), and poliovirus during the global eradication programme (21).",
