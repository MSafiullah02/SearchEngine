It was subsequently named bovine immunodeficiency virus, also known as bovine lentivirus-1 (BIV) [1], [2], [3], [4]. The cow had persistent lymphocytosis, became severely weak and emaciated following parturition and was euthanized. The lymph nodes (LN) were enlarged; although, evidence of lymphosarcoma was not detected. The LN had generalized hyperplasia and the brain had mild lymphocytic perivascular cuffing [1]. Subsequent experimental infection of cattle with this isolated agent (BIV isolate R-29) produced lesions in the lymphoid system, ranging from lymphocytosis to lymphoid hyperplasia of the LN and hemal lymph nodes (HLN). Studies of BIV were discontinued until the value of investigating the comparative features of this agent with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was recognized [5], [6], [7], [8].",

Experimental BIV infection of cattle has been associated with immune dysfunction which included a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio with delayed and lower antibody responses to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 [13]. Viral replication was identified by detection of BIV provirus or by virus isolation in a variety of tissues, including brain [14], [15], [16], [17]. Lymphadenopathy and non-suppurative meningoencephalitis have been identified in calves experimentally infected with BIV strain FL112 isolated from a dairy cow in Florida, USA [18], [19], [20], [21]. Two of six calves inoculated with BIV had clinical ataxia [21], suggestive of the bovine paraplegic syndrome (BPS) observed in Venezuelan cattle [22].",

Storage of tissues for prolonged periods (8\u201312 months) may have resulted in a higher incidence of negative results. The frequent development of concurrent infections in BIV-infected animals, especially those associated with abscesses, mastitis, and laminitis, suggested that persistent BIV infection had a role in reducing functional immune competence. Lentiviral infection of cells of the reticuloendothelial system, such as the follicular dendritic cells (FDC) can interfere with immunological recognition at several levels and may be implicated in the generation of abnormal immunological reactions [29]. In the animals infected with the bovine lentivirus 1, FDC infection and functional alteration of these cells and/or the lymphoid tissue microenvironment [30] may allow the perpetuation of a chronic infection independent of on-going viral effects on the lymphocytes of the immune system. Under some circumstances the presence of parasitic and other antigenic sources has produced an accelerated onset and clinical course of HIV disease and may be a factor for precipitation of the BIV-associated clinical disease [31], [32]. Concurrent endemic BLV and co-infection with BIV may have influenced disease manifestation. In the United States, BLV herd infection rates were 89% for all US dairy operations and 99% for those in the southeast region which included Louisiana [33].",

Another possibility is that the nervous system lesions of SBE and BIV are closely similar or identical at the light microscopic level [34]. Months after completion of this investigation, a cow aborted with a pigeon strain of C. psittaci which was isolated from the placenta and fetus [35]. Several weeks later this cow (which was serologically positive for BIV) died with metritis and brain lesions of non-suppurative lymphocytic encephalitis. At the time of death the cow was negative for Chlamydia antibody [35], suggestive of anergy, possibly similar to that reported for BIV as a loss of BIV Gag-specific antibody during the course of infection [36]. Another potential explanation for the encephalitis, other than primary lentiviral infection, is activation of latent vaccinal IBRV.

In cows that had weight loss of approximately 40%, the HLN were not enlarged. Muscle wasting, which occurred while the cows had free-choice access to feed, raised the possibility of a central depression in appetite, suggestive of a clinical neurogenic anorexia which was observed in BIV-infected calves [31]. Weight loss is a component of the recognized progressive changes of initial symptomatic disease in humans with AIDS [37], [38].",
