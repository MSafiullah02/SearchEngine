We also performed a comparative gene expression study as a reference between two groups of cirrhotic livers with HCV-high (n=7) and HCV-low (n=3) viral loads.

Then, we compared the gene expression profiles statistically with Gene Spring version 7 (Agilent Technologies, Santa HEP-14-0692_S13Clara, CA). At first, the output data were normalized per chip and per gene, and then, all 54,675 probes were filtered with at least one present flag in 10 samples each.

Immunoblotting of TMPRSS2 produced in TMPRSS2-wild type and TMPRSS2-mutant cell clones. (A) Structure of TMPRSS2 protein and the recognition site of the anti-TMPRSS2 antibody used. TMPRSS2 is a type II transmembrane serine protease and is thought to be activated by auto-cleavage at the C terminus of R255. QSR is the amino acid sequence of positions 3, 2 and 1 at the cleavage site. The antibody recognizes the C terminal active site (catalytic triad HDS) of trypsin-like serine protease.
