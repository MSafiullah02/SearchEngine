By way of anecdotal evidence, in addition to the coincidence of the beginning of the epidemic with the dry season in Wuhan mentioned above, note that Seoul and especially Tokyo, where the incidence and mortality have been lower, have on average wetter climate [5, 6]. Correlate of sharp raise in Covid-19 mortality with local dry period may also be seen on the example of Lombardy, where February is the driest month in Milan [7], as opposed to a wetter beginning of the spring in Rome [8]. The much dryer March in Spain as opposed to e.g. more humid neighbouring Portugal [9] seem to point in the same direction of raise in Covid-19 mortality correlate with transient over-dry local environment.",

FIG.1 shows the Covid-19 mortality rate in the federal states vs the average local air humidity in March. The local air humidity was defined as proxy recorded in the largest city of each federal state [11] . The choice of the German federal states data sets is motivated by the data availability and reliability, and, in particular, by the presumed uniformity of the data collection protocols in Germany. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has been excluded as the resource [11] gives no humidity data neither for Rostock nor for Schwerin. The linear least squares fit (red solid line), weighted by the most recent population size of the federal states as given by Wikipedia, gives the slope of \u22128.09 with a standard deviation of \u00b13.32, i.e. reliably negative. We have also applied the Theil-Sen estimator, also weighing the data points proportionally to population sizes, which gives the slope of \u22123.10. The corresponding fits are also shown in FIG.1 (blue dashed line) . The discrepancy between the linear and Theil-Sen estimates are not surprising as the problem is clearly multi-factorial and we are looking at only one of the factors. Still, the two estimates concur that the slope of the dependence is negative, that is mortality is on average higher in a drier air and lowers with rise of air humidity, which confirms our hypothesis on negative correlate of Covid-19 mortality with local air humidity.",

Both of the studies did not seem to take into account the effect of non-causal correlation between the seasonal increase of humidity and decrease in transmission rate due to the taken administrative measures. Still, both studies are interesting as they present an approach complementary to the one we used in FIG.1 , namely, both studies do not take into account regional variations of air humidity and Covid-19 statistics; instead, [13] is exploiting their temporal variations. In any case, the overall conclusion from those studies concurs with our hypothesis.",

Therefore, it might be useful to distinguish between the spread of Covid-19 infection and the asynchronous local rises of Covid-19 mortality. For instance, a prolonged dry weather may be taken as an indication of likely local elevation of Covid-19 mortality. In Madrid, August is the driest month of the year [21], so preventative measures might be indicated to forestall or flatten the second wave of Covid-19 there.
