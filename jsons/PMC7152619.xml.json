As of March 10, 2020, the turnaround time for the COVID-19 RT-PCR assay was 12\u201372 h [5]. One of the earliest publications on COVID-19 and CT imaging found that chest CT had a sensitivity of 98% for early presentation of COVID-19 compared with 71% using the RT-PCR assay. The lower sensitivity for RT-PCR found in this study may be due to improper sampling, low viral load at the time of testing, and various detection rates for different manufacturers [6]. While, as of March 22, 2020, the American College of Radiology does not recommend using chest CT as a screening tool for COVID-19 [7], in patients with possible exposure to COVID-19 or suspicious symptoms, the RT-PCR assay may be used in conjunction with the chest CT findings to triage patients requiring hospitalization from spreading the infection to the vulnerable hospital patient population and frontline health care workers.",
