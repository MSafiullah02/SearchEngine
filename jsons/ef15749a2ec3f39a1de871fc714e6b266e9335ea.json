As the other causes of the disease were excluded, acute enteritis or gastroenteritis was considered to be the most likely predisposing factor for the intestinal intussusception. The most common type of intussusception was found to be the ileocolic. Of the 21 dogs that underwent surgical resection and anastomosis of the intestine, 18 dogs recovered completely and three died due to complications. The high survival rate was due to the effective pre-operative, surgical and post-operative therapy.",

            "text": "Intussusception is a type of intestinal obstruction that is created by the forceful invagination of one part of the intestine into the lumen of an adjacent segment and affects mainly young animals (Orsher and Rosin, 1993; Guilford and Strombeck, 1996) . The exact pathophysiology of the intussusception still remains unclear. It may begin as a result of a local intestinal incongruency in homogeneity (induration, flaccidity or sudden anatomic change in diameter) or a mechanical linkage of non-adjacent intestinal segments, which leads to a kink or a fold in the bowel wall (Lewis and Ellison, 1987; Guilford and Strombeck, 1996) . Intussusception has been reported to occur as a sequela to a number of conditions such as intestinal parasitism, linear foreign bodies, non-specific gastroenteritis, viral-induced enteritis (parvovirus, distemper), leptospirosis, intraluminal masses and prior abdominal surgery (Wilson and Burt, 1974; Weaver, 1977; Lewis and Ellison, 1987; Oakes et al., 1994; Guilford and Strombeck, 1996) . However, others consider that most intussusceptions that occur in young animals are idiopathic (Wilson and Burt, 1974; Ellison, 1986; Lewis and Ellison, 1987) . Treatment of intussusception in dogs is by laparotomy and manual reduction or resection and anastomosis of the affected intestinal segment. Intussusception associated with systemic disease (e.g. acute viral enteritis or gastroenteritis) has an increased morbidity and mortality (Ellison, 1986) .",

A total of 220 young dogs (age range, 2 to 12 months old) that fulfilled the above criteria were admitted to the Department of Clinical Studies, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, between January 1995 and June 1999. The dogs were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated against distemper, infectious hepatitis, leptospirosis, canine parvovirus and coronavirus. On admission a physical examination followed by haematology (packed cell volume, as well as white blood cell and platelet count), biochemical screening (serum alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lipase activities and blood urea nitrogen, potassium and albumin concentration), urinalysis and a faecal examination were carried out in every case, before any kind of treatment was instituted. A direct faecal examination and fresh saline preparations were used for the detection of parasitic ova and intestinal protozoa, respectively. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (CITE test: IDDEX Laboratories Inc, Westbrook, USA) was also used at the time of admission (which ranged between 1 and 5 days from the beginning of the symptoms) for detecting parvoviral antigen in stool samples taken directly from the rectum. Abdominal radiography (plain or contrast) and/or abdominal ultrasonography were performed on dogs that were suspected of having intestinal intussusception.",

Acute enteritis or gastroenteritis predisposes to intussusception by inducing alterations in the intestinal motility. Intestinal hyper-or hypomotility is a feature of parvoviral enteritis (Dow, 1996; Guilford and Strombeck, 1996; Rewerts and Cohn, 2000) . The present findings are in contrast with those of others where most intussusceptions were either idiopathic or associated with a low incidence of viral-induced enteritis (Wilson and Burt, 1974; Weaver, 1977; Oakes et al., 1994) . The high incidence of intussusception-associated acute enteritis or gastroenteritis in this study may be attributed to the high incidence of viral or bacterial enteritis, inflammation and hypermotility in young dogs that were admitted to this hospital between 1995 and 1999.",

An increased tendency of recurrence was also reported for parvoviral enteritis-associated intussusceptions (Ellison, 1986) . According to Wolfe (1977) and Guilford and Strombeck (1996) the recurrence rate is decreased if the intussusception is resected rather than reduced manually. In contrast Oakes et al. (1994) reported recurrence in five of 22 dogs that had their intussusceptions resected. Furthermore the recurrence rate of the intussusception may be increased if the predisposing factor is still present following surgical correction (Oakes et al., 1994; Guilford and Strombeck, 1996) . In order to reduce the possibility of recurrence some authors advocate the use of enteroplication (Oakes et al., 1994; Wolfe, 1977) . The present findings seem to support those of Wolfe (1977) and those of Guilford and Strombeck (1996) . No recurrence has been reported in any of the 18 dogs that survived surgical resection of the intussusception, although the predisposing factor (acute enteritis or gastroenteritis) might have been present at the time of surgery. The use of opioids in the post-operative period in the present study may play a role in preventing the recurrence of intussusception, because these drugs increase non-propulsive gastrointestinal tone and prevent ileus during the early postoperative period (McAnulty et al., 1989) . However, Oakes et al. (1994) found no effect of these drugs on the recurrence of intussusception.",
