Guidelines for the triage of elective cases have been released by multiple professional associations including the American Urological Association (AUA), the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The American College of Surgeons has released \u201cCOVID-19 Guidelines for Triage of Urology Patients\u201d1 which include triage criteria that take into account the \u201clogistical feasibility for a give procedure\u201d based on facilitate resources including beds, staff, equipment, and supplies.2 The ACS has also called for a reduction in performing elective complex cases that may require ICU stay and ventilator support postoperatively.3 CMS\u2019 recommendations state that the \u201cconservation of critical healthcare resources is essential, in addition to limiting exposure of patients and staff to the virus that causes COVID-19.\u201d4 PPE use has also been described by these professional associations. Beyond standard surgical PPE, which include surgical bonnet or scrub cap, surgical mask, disposable or reusable gown, and surgical gloves, the ACS recommends that \u201cN95 respirators or respirators that offer a higher level of protection should be used when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g., patient intubation) in COVID-19 or suspected infected patient.\u201d5\n",

Case length, surgical and operating room staff present and number of articles of PPE were quantified. All personnel that entered the room were counted as requiring one mask and one hat (bouffant or scrub cap). All personnel who actively scrubbed during the case were counted as using a single disposable or reusable gown, and one pair of surgical gloves. Some assumptions to our methodology were required: attending and resident urologists performing robotic surgery were assigned two articles of PPE due to the unscrubbed console time. Surgical technician breaks were accounted for with electronic medical records of operating room staffing.

In situations where long-term PPE shortages may be suspected, consideration may be given to more definitive management which may require an upfront cost of higher PPE but may conserve overall resources over time. While PPE shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic are currently being addressed nationally and internationally, this study provides a baseline benchmark for articles of PPE required for common urological procedures. Should another pandemic or global disaster accompanied by critical supply shortages occur in the future, these data are pertinent to decision-making with attention to conservation and optimization in resource allocation.",
