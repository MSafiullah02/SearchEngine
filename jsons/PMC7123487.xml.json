            "text": "This chapter describes the activities of a bookclub that brought scientists and non-scientists together to read novels where infectious disease formed part of the plot, and to consider how these novels could be used to promote a better understanding of disease and epidemiology (Treffry-Goatley 2017), and the work of the professional scientist. Fictions, and popular fictions in particular, have been used to support the understanding of complex concepts. Jarvis and Gouthro (2015) identify \u2018using arts to illustrate complex concepts and dilemmas\u2019 as one of five key ways in which academics use the arts in education. This can include scientific concepts and dilemmas, such as those explored by White (2008). Fewer investigations consider how this might operate with the wider public\u2014which is where the Bad Bugs Bookclub concept originated. A particular focus of the bookclub was to suggest how teachers in Higher Education might use these novels in their practice, but I believe that this specialised format, with a relatively narrow focus on subject matter but no limitation on genre, can be used to benefit a wide range of professional (and non-professional) audiences. With a focus on infectious disease, the Bad Bugs Bookclub has also been particularly targeted towards students reading for a degree in Biomedical Science. This degree is accredited by the Institute of Biomedical Sciences: graduates are professionally qualified to be employed as medical laboratory scientists. (The nature of student participation in bookclub meetings and related activities varies, and will be described later in the chapter.) The discussions that take place during bookclub meetings enable scientists to better understand how non-scientists perceive different aspects of science. The literature on fiction and education has identified its capacity for enabling learners to experience the feelings and perceptions of those from many different walks of life. Keen\u2019s work on empathy (2007) outlines the challenges associated with this, and many educators have used fiction to support a better understanding of the perceptions of those they feel are different or other (Tisdell and Thompson 2007). In the bookclub milieu, gaps in knowledge, misunderstandings and concerns can be addressed through conversation and explanation, without the need for the experts to resort to \u2018lecturing\u2019. Fiction forms an important part of social discourse generally. Many people\u2019s perceptions of the professions is shaped, at least partially by popular fictions. Scientists abound in film and television, but their representation can be partial (Jubas 2015). The novels considered by the bookclub have enabled us to explore more fully aspects such as how the scientist is represented in literature; the role of female scientists in plot development; and the laboratory environment in which scientists operate\u2014in terms of project development and delivery, teamwork, equipment and procedures. Indeed, in whatever form the bookclub has been delivered, and to whichever \u2018audience\u2019, it is apparent from discussions\u2014meeting notes are recorded and logged on the website (Verran 2009)\u2014that much is learnt about transmission of infection and treatment and emergence of disease, as well as about fiction and communication through conversation and creative writing.\n",

            "text": "As a microbiology lecturer, a key premise to my teaching philosophy was that students should be able to communicate their science knowledge and enthusiasm to different audiences. This would in turn demand understanding of scientific principles on their part, as well as different styles and modes of communication. As critical education theorists have pointed out, fostering effective communication is integral to supporting deeper forms of learning (Brookfield 2015; Mezirow 2000). Thus I developed a number of learning activities to enable the acquisition of communication skills. In particular, I encouraged the use of art as a medium for science communication. In a lecture to first-year microbiology undergraduates, using many examples, I asked what relationship microbiology has to art, and how art can be used to convey information about microbiology to audiences that may be less open to, or less familiar with, science (Verran 2010a). An associated assignment was the production of a creative output that illustrated some aspect of the topic.",

The Family Fun Day comprises a range of events including author readings, storytelling, exhibitions and other activities. The Bad Bugs Bookclub provided a \u2018science corner\u2019, focusing on microbiological aspects of the (then) popular teen novel (2005) by Stephenie Meyer (Verran 2010a). For example, Edward, the hero, became a vampire in 1918 to prevent his death from influenza, thus the transmission and prevention of influenza was compared to that of vampirism and other diseases transmitted by biting. Extending this work to include zombies, a second workshop utilised a game, SimZombie (Verran et al. 2013), to demonstrate the spread of the zombie condition as illustrated in four children\u2019s novels: Boneshaker (Priest 2009), Warm Bodies (Marion 2011), Rot and Ruin (Maberry 2010) and The Enemy (Higson 2009). A third workshop in 2014 compared the emergence of smallpox with that of zombie-ism using (Cooney 2005) and a newly developed game, SimFection (Carolan et al. 2018). In all of these activities, students helped to plan and deliver events, some as volunteers and others as part of their final year dissertation.",

Compton keeps a cheese and pickled egg sandwich in a shoebox under his bed for 13 weeks, after which he eats parts of it and discovers that it has given him time-travelling powers. The microbiological element of this is clearly the 13-week incubation of the sandwich, thus we carried out an experiment to see what would actually happen under these conditions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1B4wFf_8Z8 for the story; and a time-lapse film at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY9leVeLZo8). We brought the 13-week old soil-like remnants of the sandwich (sealed in a transparent sandwich box) to the Family Fun Day, along with microscopes and fungal cultures, and talked about food hygiene and safe sandwich production, storage and consumption (Fig. 7.3). The author Matt Brown noted: \u201cIt was a personal thrill to have a team of real scientists work through the science of my Compton Valance books\u2026 I loved what she did and really think that it will have sent kids home, fizzing with inspiration. I was also very pleased to note that my description of a thirteen-and-a-half week old cheese and pickled egg sandwich was pretty accurate. It really did smell worse than having twenty rhinoceroses farting right in your face\u201d.\n",

From its inception, it had been decided that non-fiction would not be a focus for the Bad Bugs Bookclub. We would focus on more accessible works of fiction that enable wide-ranging discussion around accuracy, misunderstanding, and transferability to the \u2018real world\u2019, whilst developing science literacy \u2018through the back door\u2019. Nevertheless, some works of non-fiction have crept into the canon: The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (Skloot 2010), Microbe Hunters (de Kruif 1926), 28 Stories of AIDS in Africa (Nolen 2007), The Ghost Map (Johnson 2006), and I Contain Multitudes (Yong 2016). Of these, all but I Contain Multitudes are written as stories, and thus retain more informal entertainment value better suited to our reading group. There has recently been a significant surge in non-fiction books focusing on microbiology, perhaps reflecting interest in the human microbiome, antimicrobial resistance and the importance of infectious disease to global health, such as Mark Pallen\u2019s (2018) fascinating account of the Birmingham smallpox outbreak The Vaccine Race (Wadman 2017) and How to Survive a Plague (France 2017).",

In addition, students could also be stimulated to produce their own creative writing outputs, for example by writing case studies\u2014of great value on biomedical science and medicine education\u2014using more personal stories (Yuan and Benson 1995): even comics have been used in medical education and patient care (Green and Myers 2010).

Thus an additional useful activity (again, not tested) would be for students to supplement the reading of fiction with an examination of peer-reviewed outputs, in order to synthesise a critical evaluation of the science as represented in the novel, and to see the lineages between narrative fictions and scientific scholarship. For example, fungal parasites that infect ants (Evans et al. 2011) are the cause of human infection in The Girl with All the Gifts (Carey 2014). Microbiology (Benbow et al. 2013) has great potential to play a part in forensic medicine, such as that described in the investigations of the deterioration of human cadavers in Patricia Cornwell\u2019s (1994). Neurological disease and behavioural change (Flegr 2013) has been associated with infection by Toxoplasma gondii described in Parasite (Grant 2013).",

A thorough reading of the novel being studied, preparation of questions and an understanding of key microbiology themes are essential preparation, as well as a serious approach to the event (since the reading group is often comprised of the student\u2019s friends or colleagues). One student selected AIDS Sutra: Untold Stories from India (Akhavi 2008) for discussion because it focused on her country of origin where AIDS was rarely mentioned. Another considered comparison of Semmelweis\u2019s work with content related to childbed fever and Streptococcus pyogenes in the novel The Bone Garden (Gerritsen 2007). A third used existing reading guides to assess their value for student reading groups. A fourth focused on her interest in the human microbiome to develop, deliver and evaluate a public event at Manchester Museum of Science and Industry to raise awareness of probiotics and fermented foods: she is a co-author on the resultant publication (Verran et al. 2018b). For all of these students, activities directly helped secure employment ( teaching, medical communications), by evidencing valuable skills.\n",

The venue displayed relevant student art, including information on their research and reflections that helped to create the outputs (Verran 2010b), and the event also included talks, games and fund-raising activities to entertain the audience of around fifty. The bookclub meeting (The Calcutta Chromosome, Ghosh 1996) was held in the evening attended by the usual small membership.

Themes began to emerge from the readings. One theme was the use of vampires and zombies as models for infectious disease epidemiology, which led to the production of a range of learning activities and materials (Carolan et al. 2018; Verran et al. 2013). These materials focused on the development of computer models to illustrate the spread of disease, thus avoiding the pitfalls associated with trivialisation of topics and associated lack of student engagement (Houghton et al. 2016). Another was how emerging diseases such as new strains of influenza became subjects for fiction. This triggered interdisciplinary research with the University\u2019s Institute for Gothic Studies, the designation of \u2018emerging infectious literatures\u2019 (Verran and Aldana Reyes 2018), and the author\u2019s enrolment on a Masters in Creative Writing. Thus the Bad Bugs Bookclub truly played a part in my own professional education: as a scientist, I had not had the opportunity to study fiction for many decades. I discovered wonderfully written, stimulating books such as Oryx and Crake (Atwood 2004), (Roth 2010), Frog Music (Donoghue 2014) and Rant (Palahniuk 2007), and became much more aware of a range of misconceptions and misunderstandings about infectious disease amongst non-scientists. Lifelong learning was brought home to me most forcibly.",

            "text": "\nAntimicrobial resistance is a matter of grave concern. Microorganisms are becoming resistant to many different types of antibiotics with concomitant problems in not only treatment of infection but also in prophylaxis in surgery and immunosuppression (Bowater 2017). Yet few novels use this phenomenon as a plot device, perhaps because the impact tends to be on individuals and their families rather than on populations where there is more opportunity to develop a bigger story (more people infected). A range of different outputs, perhaps quicker to produce than the novel, has been produced recently. The graphic novel Surgeon X (Kenney and Watkiss 2016), published with accompanying learning materials and activities, attempts to engage audiences in discussion\u2014and behaviour change\u2014about a future without antibiotics. Infectious Futures is a series of short stories commissioned by Nesta (2015) describing a future where antimicrobial resistance is commonplace and much of our way of life has been irrevocably altered. Plays broadcast on BBC Radio 4 have described different scenarios: one, Resistance (McDermid 2017), where a resistant bacterium causes an apocalyptic pandemic spread initially through ingestion; and another, The Truth About Hawaii (Emanuel 2018), broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in January/February 2018 focuses on one child battling against a serious infection. A Fierce Radiance (Belfer 2010) is set at the end of the Second World War and at the beginning of the antibiotic era. It describes initial attempts to mass produce new antibiotics and decisions as to who should be the first recipients of these drugs. Although the book ambitiously encompasses virtually all genres (romance, war, espionage, murder, thriller, historical), it provided a platform for useful bookclub discussion. Additional bookclub meetings were planned using this novel as supplementary activities for public engagement events focusing on antimicrobial resistance, the search for new antibiotics and a comparison with pre-antibiotic treatment. However, although the events themselves were successful, no members of the public signed up for the bookclub: afternoon meetings were not attractive, and after evening events participants preferred to go home (Redfern et al. 2018; Verran et al. 2018a).",

Since the focus for the novels studied by the Bad Bugs Bookclub was infectious disease, there were occasions where the disease was very much background to the story, typically providing the setting within which the plot develops. Frog Music (Donoghue 2014) is set within a nineteenth century San Francisco during a smallpox epidemic. Similarly, in A Lovely Way to Burn (Welsh 2014), the protagonist pursues a murderer during the emergence of a virulent influenza pandemic. The Pesthouse (Crace 2007) describes a journey across America (West to East) some years after an apocalyptic pandemic, but we never know what the disease actually was. For these novels, we considered how the disease affected the plot, and tended to discuss the writing and the story itself rather than the microbiology. Three novels that dealt more overtly with the city of Manchester\u2014thus providing local interest for the bookclub\u2014than with infectious disease, were all set before or during the Industrial Revolution: everyday infections encountered by the characters demonstrated how disease impacted on public health (Mary Barton, Gaskell 1848; The Manchester Man, Banks 1876; The Street Philosopher, Plampin 2009).",

As Jubas and colleagues have shown (Jubas et al. 2017), fictions can stimulate reflection on public issues such as health and healthcare. A narrative theory of learning draws upon literary, psychological and critical social theories to consider how educators can expose learners to different perspectives and circumstances to broaden their viewpoints and gain insights into various social issues. Books that explore pandemics or the ethical implications associated with the production of antimicrobial agents can delve into these real-life concerns through fictional stories. Using literature in a creative way, such as through the Bad Bugs Bookclub, fosters this kind of dynamic and critical engagement in learning.",

The content of the novels enables discussion that can be used to update the appropriate disease epidemiology, and/or consider current concerns regarding global health. The nature of the discussions can also provide students with a broader perspective on public understanding of science and communication skills (oral and written). However, despite the versatility that the bookclub format provides, the audiences benefitting from these activities have been limited, primarily because I have not promoted the resource or practice as yet. The online resource, comprising meeting reports and reading guides is a significant resource, freely available to anyone wanting to set up their own bookclub. In addition to the unassessed, and voluntary participation of students in the bookclub, there is potential for developing the format into a more formal learning activity for ( science) students, as well as for utilising other science-based topics rather than microbiology (for example environmental science, medicine, genetics). It is hoped that this chapter will raise awareness of the use of a bookclub to support professional education.",
