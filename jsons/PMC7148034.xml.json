            "text": "Diversification of web search results is a well-known approach to handle queries that are ambiguous, underspecified, or including multiple aspects [23]. Diversification methods in the literature are broadly categorized as implicit or explicit. The implicit methods essentially make use the documents in the candidate set, i.e., the initial retrieval results for the query. In contrary, explicit methods exploit the knowledge of query aspects, which is usually inferred from a topic taxonomy [1] or query log [20]. The exhaustive experiments in the literature confirm that the latter type of additional information is very useful, as explicit methods consistently outperform the implicit ones [10, 23]. This finding does not render the implicit diversification less valuable, as in many scenarios the query aspects are not readily available or not easy to infer (e.g., for the rare queries in Web search) [15], but rather calls for approaches to improve their performance.",

First, being a simple, intuitive and efficient method, MMR is employed as a baseline and/or representative approach in a large number of works (e.g., [10, 21, 26, 27]). Secondly, we conducted preliminary experiments with some other candidates (namely, MSD [8], MMC and GNE [26]) and did not observe meaningful performance differences wrt. MMR. Actually, only GNE produced slightly better results, however as it is based on a greedy local search, its execution time is considerably longer than MMR. Therefore, we proceed with MMR as a representative method. In what follows, we first briefly review MMR and then discuss how word embeddings are employed to represent documents in this context.",

The second group of features is intended to reflect the diversity of a ranking. To this end, we propose to compute the pairwise similarity of the documents, and aggregate these scores using minimum, maximum and average functions. While computing such similarities, we employ both tf-idf and word embedding based document representations (as discussed in Sect. 2).
