With this success came the dilemma of post\u2010transplant infectious complications, which, to this day, remain a significant contributor to overall morbidity and mortality in the lung transplant recipient (LTR). Of all solid organ transplants, lungs are the most prone to infection, and this is likely due to several factors unique to the lung allograft. Apart from constant exposure to the outside environment, the lungs are exposed to the colonized native airway and have been stripped of their usual mechanisms of defence including the cough reflex, bronchial circulation and lymphatic drainage. These factors, coupled with the induction of an immunosuppressed state collaborate to produce an environment that is ripe for the development of infection.",

In a recent epidemiological study in which 51 LTR were followed for a mean of 38.2 months, 75% of infectious episodes occurred within the first year after transplantation, and nearly half (42%) occurred within the first 3 months.\n3\n Bacterial disease accounted for the largest proportion of infections (48%) followed by viral, fungal and mycobacterial disease (35%, 13% and 4%, respectively). In the early post\u2010LT period (days to 1 month), nosocomial organisms account for the majority of infections. Following this period and for the next several months, at a time when immunosuppression is at the highest level, opportunistic organisms such as CMV and fungi account for the majority of infections.

Prompt recognition and treatment of these factors is paramount for appropriate management. Prophylaxis strategies continue to evolve and show promise for several of the infectious agents. Avoidance of these infectious complications may not only lead to a decrease in the direct consequences of infection but also to a reduction in the subsequent causes of ultimate graft failure including both acute and chronic rejection. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem, and although newer antimicrobials will likely be of benefit, especially against viral and fungal pathogens, prevention of these diseases remains the best approach. Careful consideration and further research are needed regarding the mechanisms by which infection and subsequent inflammation alters the immunoregulatory machinery of the host and subsequently leads to the development failure of the allograft. Factors that are important in evaluating an infectious episode include time after transplant, immunosuppression, CMV serostatus, prophylaxis regimen and treatment for acute rejection.\n3\n Given that outcomes appear to be improved with early recognition and treatment of disease, all practitioners must always maintain a high index of suspicion caring for these patients.",
