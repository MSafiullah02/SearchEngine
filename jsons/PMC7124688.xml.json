The ability to replicate in a variety of cell lines is characteristic of EAV, SHFV, and PRRSV, but not of LDV, which has a strict host cell specificity. In mice, it is known that only a subpopulation of peritoneal macrophages and other macrophages support LDV replication [2]. To date, no cell lines in which LDV can replicate or LDV receptors responsible for cell tropism have been identified; therefore, the mechanism underlying LDV susceptibility restriction remains unclear.",

It is close to the N-terminal end of three potential adjacent transmembrane segments that mimic sequences in the corona virus M protein [11]. The larger protein is the envelope glycoprotein VP-3, encoded by ORF 5. It is generally heterogenous in size (25\u201340 kD) due to varying amounts of N-glycosylation [12]. Li et al. [13] have postulated that LDV VP-3 may be the virus attachment protein. Their studies have shown that the neutralization epitope is located in the short envelope glycoprotein ectodomain and is associated with polylactosaminoglycan chains, which may affect neutralizing antibody binding to LDV virions.",

            "text": "LDV M/VP-2 and VP-3 are present in virions as heterodimers that are covalently linked by disulfide bonds, probably between single cysteine residues in the protein ectodomains [14]. Because disulfide bond breakage causes viral infectivity loss, linkage between M/VP-2 and VP-3 appears to be required for host cell entry and is perhaps achieved by generating the virion receptor attachment site. Further analysis of the interaction between LDV VP-3-M/VP-2 heterodimer envelope proteins and host cells will require an expression system that includes glycosylation and cell surface localization. Using transient mammalian expression systems based on Sindbis and vaccinia virus-based expression vectors, the non-structural proteins 2 and 3 (nsp2 and 3) of EAV and ORF 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 products of PRRSV have been reported [15], [16], [17]. Although in vitro translation of LDV ORF 5 and ORF 6 transcripts has been reported in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system [18], a mammalian cell system expressing LDV proteins remains unestablished. While experiments with the transient expression systems described above are convenient for studying cytotoxicity [17], cellular immune responses [15], and viral processing [16], there is considerable variability between individual experiments. Cell lines stably expressing viral envelope proteins would be useful for detailed molecular analysis of interactions between viral and host cell proteins and mechanisms underlying LDV susceptibility restriction. In this study, we established a stable mammalian cell system expressing both the LDV ORF 5- and ORF 6-encoded proteins (ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins) as viral envelope proteins and analyzed the expressed proteins by immunological methods.",
