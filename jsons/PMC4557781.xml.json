Culture has low complexity but also low sensitivity and requires viable organism. Immunologic techniques like direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) are rapid but can be laborious and have lower sensitivity than molecular diagnostics. Sequencing provides substantial information but is technically complex and impractical. Molecular diagnostics, although fairly complex, are becoming the preferred technology because of high sensitivity and shorter testing time.",

No further analysis was performed on discrepant results due to low sample and nucleic acid extract volumes after RT-PCR/ESI-MS testing was completed. This was especially the case for the DFA-negative/RT-PCR/ESI-MS\u2013positive samples (Table 1). Comparison of DFA with RT-PCR/ESI-MS was problematic because comparison of a non-amplified diagnostic, DFA, with an amplified diagnostic, RT-PCR/ESI-MS, may have skewed the RT-PCR/ESI-MS performance characteristics. Additionally, all of the xTAG RVP\u2013positive results were initially DFA negative, and this discrepancy was also problematic. Additionally, DFA could have generated false-positive results, as 3 DFA-positive detections were not confirmed by RT-PCR/ESI-MS or xTAG RVP. A more accurate comparison would have utilized 2 amplified tests, such as xTAG RVP and type specific real-time PCR. Although DFA comparison was suboptimal, it was the best available comparison method based on clinical virology screening algorithms used to report respiratory virus diagnoses. Finally, xTAG RVP assay was only performed on DFA-negative samples collected among immunocompromised patient negatives as per clinical virology testing algorithm policy. Many DFA-negative samples collected among immunocompetent patients could have tested positive with xTAG RVP. Additionally, the DFA negative, RT-PCR/ESI-MS false positives (Table 1.) could have been more accurately confirmed if RT-PCR/ESI-MS and xTAG RVP had been directly compared for those samples.",
