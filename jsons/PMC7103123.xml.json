These Na+/K+-ATPases are composed of two subunits (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and an auxiliary subunit \u03b3. The \u03b1-subunit binds ATP and both Na+ and K+ ions as well as allosteric binding for cardenolides. The combination of \u03b1 subunit and \u03b2 subunit have been shown to exhibit different kinetic parameters, including selectivity for cardenolides, and tissue distribution (Baker Bechmann et al., 2016, Habeck et al., 2016, Katz et al., 2015).",

The tested compounds were added to the wells 1 h prior to the addition of TGEV (0.01 MOI). The plates were then incubated for an additional 22 h at 37 \u00b0C as indicated. To quantify the viral yield in the cells, the supernatant of cells in each specific treatment was harvested and subjected to viral titer determination via an end-point dilution assay conducted in ST cells. The mean values and S.D. were calculated from three independent experiments. Serial dilutions of each supernatant were prepared and inoculated to cultured cells in a 96-well plastic plate, which contained an eight sample series of 10-fold dilutions each with 12-repeats. The number of cell cultures that were infected was then determined for each virus dilution, by looking for a cytopathic effect. The endpoint of viral dilution leading to cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated wells was estimated using the Reed Muench method and designated as one TCID50 (Tissue Culture Infective Dose). TCID50 was then used for the measure of infectious TGEV virus titer as approximately 1 TCID = 0.69 PFU (Plaque-forming unit).",

Once the mouse was able to produce antibodies against N protein, the mouse's spleen cells were then fused with its myeloma cells to generate immortalized hybridoma cells producing the antibody.

The ST cells were pretreated with the test compounds for 1 h prior to infection with TGEV at an MOI of 7. After 6 h of TGEV infection, the ST cells were fixed and subjected to IFA with antibodies specific for the S and N proteins of TGEV. Reevesioside A, reevesioside F, and epi-reevesioside F, all possessing structural features similar to those found in the cardenolides, were found to impart potent anti-TGEV activity with IC50 values of 164 \u00b1 47 nM, 304 \u00b1 44 nM, and 155 \u00b1 39 nM, respectively. Accordingly, more cardenolides were sought so their anti-TGEV activity could be tested. Digoxin, digitoxin, oleandrin, and ouabain amongst others were also found to impart potent anti-TGEV activities with IC50 values of 615 \u00b1 120, 373 \u00b1 32, 166 \u00b1 8, and 147 \u00b1 28 nM, respectively (Table 1\n). Next, we examined the inhibitory activity of these cardenolides against Na+/K+-ATPase and found a correlated trends of inhibition for both TGEV and Na+/K+-ATPase (Table 1). The represented structures and dose dependent inhibition curves for IC50 values from IFA results of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1A, B and C respectively. Moreover, the N protein expression by western analyses in TGEV infected ST cells also exhibited a dose dependent manner of decreases by treatments with oleandrin or reevesioside A (Fig. 1D). Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 protein level was not significantly affected upon TGEV infection in ST cells (Fig. 1E). Thus, these cardenolides, Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors, can protect ST cells from TGEV replication.",

Accordingly, the less potent dihydroouabain and reevesioside G/epi-reevesioside G at a higher concentration of 10 \u03bcM exhibited better protection effects for caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2A) and cytopathic effect than at 1 \u03bcM (Fig. 2B).

When the Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11 expression was knocked down to 34 \u00b1 13% and 64 \u00b1 3% respectively, the resultant TGEV infected cells expressed relatively less TGEV N protein, 26 \u00b1 6% and 47 \u00b1 9% (Fig. 4A). We then measured the relative TGEV N and S expression level by IFA for TGEV infected cells harboring ATP1A1-shRNAs or control-shRNA and used it as an indication of TGEV infectivity (Fig. 4B). The Na+/K+-ATPase depleted cell clones retained 43 \u00b1 12% and 69 \u00b1 13% of infectivity to TGEV respectively, compared to the control-shRNA cells, which correlated the relative Na+/K+-ATPase expression levels to the corresponding infectivity (Fig. 4C). Moreover, aldosterone and Db cAMP were reported to increase the Na+/K+-ATPase level and activity (Delamere and King, 1992, Feraille et al., 2003, Gonin et al., 2001, Salyer et al., 2013) therefore we applied them to perform a gain-of-function experiment for Na+/K+-ATPase and TGEV infectivity. We found aldosterone and Db cAMP moderately augmented the Na+/K+-ATPase protein level in ST cells (Fig. 4D-a) and increased the infectivity of TGEV (Fig. 4D-b). Furthermore, aldosterone and Db cAMP were able to antagonize anti-TGEV activity of cardenolides (Fig. 4D-c). Therefore, we concluded that Na+/K+-ATPase contributed to TGEV infectivity in ST cells.",

            "text": "Different coronaviruses recognize their own specific host cell receptors for infectivity (Blau et al., 2001, Chan et al., 2015, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). The murine coronavirus, MHV, is a coronavirus that causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, and infects murine cells through the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule-1 (CAE-CAM-1), a cell surface receptor, receptor for attachment and entry (Blau et al., 2001, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). TGEV uses and binds membrane aminopeptidase N as its cell receptor for viral entry (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). The identified anti-TGEV cardenolides did not exert anti-MHV activity in terms of reduction in MHV induced cytopathic effects and viral protein expression (Fig. 5). Moreover, cardenolides inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase with selectivity over the combination of its \u03b1 (\u03b11-\u03b14) and \u03b2 (\u03b21-\u03b23) isoforms (Baker Bechmann et al., 2016, Habeck et al., 2016, Katz et al., 2015) and cells express different relative levels of \u03b1 subunit which also determines their responsiveness to cardenolides (Yang et al., 2009). Thus, the combination of Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms and the specific cell receptor for each coronavirus are suggested to be important for their selectivity of cardenolides against TGEV over MHV. Moreover, it also merits further exploration of anti-viral activity of cardenolides against other coronaviruses. In addition to above mentioned, whether the Na+/K+-ATPase coupled cellular signaling pathways (Newman et al., 2008) upon the binding to cardenolides contribute to their anti-TGEV activities is also under investigation in our laboratory.",
