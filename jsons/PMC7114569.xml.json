The risk of cross-infection from these airborne respiratory diseases can be high among vulnerable hospital patients and the healthcare staff who care for them. This is particularly relevant in general ward settings where the indoor air environment is not equipped to handle these forms of infection. The situation is further aggravated by the various patient treatment procedures that can generate large amounts of aerosols, e.g. physiotherapy. Furthermore, air ventilation systems are a recognised source of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks in hospitals.1 Outbreaks of Acinetobacter infection have also been observed to be airborne spread.2 Similarly, widespread environmental contamination with Clostridium difficile has been reported.3\n",

The new design replaces the normal corridor return without air return duct with an exhaust air duct that extracts exhaust air from inside the cubicle into the open area outside the hospital. This exhaust air duct can be installed in the cubicle at either a high ceiling or low bed level. It would be very difficult to conduct a real life experiment in a hospital to assess this ducted return strategy for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, such a study would require sophisticated instruments to measure and collect the necessary three-dimensional data and might very well impact on routine patient care. Accordingly, this study used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyse the \u2018ducted return strategy\u2019 under the three air change rates of 4, 6 and 12 air changes per hour (ACH) adopted in various international ventilation design standards.6, 8\n",

Further analysis of the location of the exhaust point indicated that the high level exhaust grille layout provided even better CRE results. This can be explained by the interaction between body thermal plumes and the downward supply air stream. These findings agree with experimental results obtained for the dispersion of exhaled droplet nuclei in hospital wards with different ventilation systems.28, 29 This further suggests that the low level exhaust design should be abandoned, as it is difficult to implement in existing hospital general wards due to space constraints.",

The 4 ACH design does not provide good results owing to air flowing from the cubicle to the corridor. Although at 6 ACH most of the air is exhausted through the high level exhaust grille, a significant portion of the air still flows toward the corridor via the cubicle entrance. When operating at the higher rate of 12 ACH, the CRE at the exhaust approaches unity and only an extremely small amount of air leaks into the ward corridor. This shows that, when the supply and exhaust of air is maintained at 12 ACH, the main air stream flows from the corridor towards the ward cubicle and a clean to less clean air flow direction is achieved.",

The relatively simple design of the proposed system is based on an air-ducted exhaust situated at the ward cubicle ceiling level and a higher non-recirculating airflow supply of 12 ACH. The AHU should also be designed to run at lower rates of air change to save energy during the non-peak seasons for infectious disease. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the work and capital outlay required to install the additional exhaust return air duct and a larger capacity AHU represent a very small fraction of the construction cost of a new hospital general ward. Similarly, the cost of retrofitting an existing general ward would be far less than that of a full-scale refurbishment.",

Even so, a number of questions remain to be answered, including the need to locate the hospital where there are sufficient and regular air movements or wind, the types of hospital design layout suitable for natural ventilation, and whether specific indoor environmental conditions are required. Until such time that the natural ventilation approach has been fully explored and endorsed, the ventilation design proposed in this study remains a useful and effective alternative.",
