Children accounted for approximately 2% of confirmed cases in the current study, although they make up 18% to 22% of the population in Korea, China and the United States. 15,18,20 Admission rates for infected children would be predicted to vary markedly depending upon the criteria for testing and for admission. When COVID-19 was first recognized, almost all infected children were admitted due to the severity of disease in adults. However, it has become apparent that most children can safely remain as outpatients. The preliminary admission rate was 20% in 745 cases in the US 18 but they estimate that the true rate could be as low as 5.7% since data were missing for 1827 cases and hospitalization status is more likely to be known for more severe cases. ICU admission occurred in about 5% of pediatric hospitalizations in a hospital in Wuhan, but the rate would have been higher had children with mild disease not been admitted. 11,12 The preliminary ICU admission rate in the US appears to be higher at about 10% of hospitalized children but could be lower as ICU status is more likely to be known for severe cases. 18 However, this rate could also increase as some reported US cases will still be in hospital. The criteria for ICU admission vary by hospital and must become stricter .

The prevalence and the contribution of asymptomatic or mild infection to disease transmission is an emerging area of research. 21-23 Deaths from COVID-19 predominate in the elderly and are commonly associated with a hyper-inflammatory state. 24 It is not clear why this harmful immune response is rare in children. Understanding the presentations of COVID-19 disease in children and how they differ from the presentations of more common childhood viral illnesses should lead to a better understanding of the observed profound variation in morbidity and mortality between adults and children. 25 The main limitation of this study is that pediatric data are yet to be reported for most countries, data would not have been recently been updated on all websites, and data on hospitalizations were missing from most websites. Data from the publications will already be out of date. The number of reported cases is very much determined by testing algorithms which may favor testing of elderly adults over children. The age ranges that were analyzed were not uniform with the upper limit for the pediatric age range varying from 14 to 19 years. The data in the current study may under-estimate ICU admissions and deaths. Initial data from China in adults with pneumonia showed a lag of about 12 days between symptom onset and admission so these outcomes may yet occur for children in the current study. 26 The impact of COVID-19 on .
