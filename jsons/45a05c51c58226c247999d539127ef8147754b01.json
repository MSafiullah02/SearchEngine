The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS-COV2 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25 th April, 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non-structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T>I, 5828P>L and 5865Y>C are unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P>L is predominant in both Europe and USA. Mutational changes in amino acids are predicted to alter structure and function of corresponding proteins, thereby it is imperative to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral orf1ab.",

Positive-stranded, RNA genomes of Coronaviruses is around 27 to 32-kb in length, of which about 2/3 rd encompasses viral Orf1ab gene and expresses the largest and most complex polyproteins of any RNA viruses. The open reading frame 1 (ORF1), functions as replicase, replicase/transcriptase, or polymerase polyproteins, is translated into ORF1a (approximately 486kDa, major product) and ORF1b (~306KDa) polyproteins in the host cell. Virus-encoded proteinases including Papain like protease (PLPs) and 3C like protease (3CL Pro) cleaves ORF1 into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps)(1,2). ORF1a comprising nsps (nsp 1 to nsp 10) play an important role in coping cellular stresses and maintaining functional integrity of the cellular components along with the pivotal roles in viral replication. On the other hand, ORF1b encodes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), exonuclease (nsp14), a polyU (Uridylate) specific endonuclease (nsp15), and methyl transferase (nsp16). Hence, majority of these nsps play an important role in viral pathogenesis and promising target for anti-viral drug targeting and vaccine synthesis (3).",

Different states of USA like Washington D.C, New York, Connecticut, Idaho, Georgia etc have uploaded sequence of Orf1ab polyprotein in the database. Since COVID-19 originated in Wuhan and found to be extended to different parts of the globe with variation in its virulence, it is imperative to identify the mutations occurred in Orf1ab polyprotein and consequent impact in protein structure and interaction with the host body. Hence the present study aims (i) to identify the mutations observed in orf1ab polyprotein, (ii) to predict the conformational changes of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein due to the mutations and (iii) to identify the signature pattern, if any for USA.",

Comparing to the European and Asian strain(s) we observed four characteristic mutations 265T>I (nsp 2), 4715P>L (nsp 12), 5828P>L (nsp 13) and 5865Y>C (nsp 13) which can be considered as a signature pattern for USA. It is noteworthy to mention here that 5828P>L and 5865Y>C, exclusively found in USA till now; whereas 265T>I is found in very low abundance in Asia (4.42%) and not found at all in Europe. 4715P>L is commonly found in both USA (58.1%) and Europe (51.6%) but present in low abundance in Asia(11.2%). 971P>L and 6158F>L are frequently observed in Georgia and South Carolina only representing the South-East region of the country. All of the four signature mutations caused structural alteration in their respective non-structural proteins (nsp 2, nsp 12 and nsp 13). Thereby it is essential to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral ",
