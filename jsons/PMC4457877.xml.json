PRR ligation triggers innate immune responses and leads to the induction of inflammatory and antiviral gene expression, which together function to limit pathogen growth, activate the adaptive immune response, and ultimately resolve the infection [1,2]. Precise regulation of PRR-mediated signaling is necessary to both avoid inadvertent tissue damage in response to non-pathogenic stimuli, and to prevent immunopathology resulting from excessive expression of inflammatory molecules. In essence, the ideal inflammatory response must exhibit a balance between appropriate activation against a genuine threat and self-limiting behavior once that threat has been controlled. Despite its importance in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis and limiting pathogen-associated diseases, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of this balance are poorly understood.",

Generally, lung tissues infected with pathogenic isolates exhibit high virus titers and robust inflammatory gene expression, as has been documented in in vivo studies with the 1918 Spanish influenza virus [8,9], highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses [10\u201312], and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus [13,14]. In contrast, seasonal influenza viruses typically replicate less efficiently, elicit more restrained inflammatory responses, and are usually not associated with lethal infections. Recent evidence has implicated the level of virus replication in infected lung tissues as the primary phenotypic variable driving inflammation and lethal outcomes [15,16]. Other data indicate that influenza viruses that exhibit significant differences in pathogenicity stimulate qualitatively similar host responses that differ primarily at the level of magnitude and kinetics [17]. However, these studies have not revealed the mechanisms that account for the different profile dynamics observed in infections by high and low pathogenic viruses. Such information would aid in clarifying not only how some influenza viruses induce lethal disease, but also the general mechanisms that regulate inflammatory balance.",

Referred to as systems inference microarray analysis, our method builds on current approaches that use co-expression analysis to isolate modules of functional signatures in gene expression data and then extends these methods by fitting the gene expression modules to mathematical equations (models) by using segmented regression analysis. Models can be created to look for strain-dependent responses and, unlike traditional differential expression analysis, to predict gene expression under new experimental conditions. By using this method, we set out to determine how influenza viruses that exhibit variable pathogenicity profiles influence the dynamics of the inflammatory response.",

            "text": "To characterize the dynamics of the host immune response to specific virus isolates, we infected mice with 105 PFU of three virus isolates with distinct pathogenicity profiles and harvested lung tissues at 14 time points after infection (from 0 to 7 days post-infection; n = 3 per virus per time point; see Fig 1) for several parallel analyses. These viruses included a low pathogenicity seasonal H1N1 influenza virus (A/Kawasaki/UTK4/2009 [H1N1]; referred to as \u2018H1N1\u2019), a mildly pathogenic virus from the 2009 pandemic season (A/California/04/2009 [H1N1]; referred to as \u2018pH1N1\u2019), and a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (A/Vietnam/1203/2004 [H5N1]; referred to as \u2018H5N1\u2019). An initial inoculation of 105 PFU was used as previous studies indicated that a high virus dose was needed to invoke different pathologies in H1N1 and pH1N1-infected mice [13]. As expected, lung virus titers (virus titers determined by plaque assay and reported in plaque forming units [PFU] per gram lung; Fig 1) indicated a clear hierarchy of mild, moderate, and severe virus-induced disease. Specifically, the H5N1 virus produced the highest lung titers and between days 5 and 7 post-infection, this virus also caused mortality in the animals whose lungs were to be collected on day 7 post-infection (i.e., \u2018severe\u2019 disease). In contrast, all animals infected with the H1N1 or pH1N1 viruses survived the duration of the time course study; however, pH1N1-infected animals were visibly sicker and exhibited higher lung titers relative to those infected with H1N1 at all time points observed after the first 30 h post-infection (i.e., \u2018moderate\u2019 and \u2018mild\u2019 disease, respectively). Histopathological analysis of tissue samples collected on days 1, 2, and 5 post-infection (Fig 2) also showed that H5N1-infected tissue exhibited the earliest, most severe signs of inflammation and inflammatory immune cell infiltrates followed by pH1N1-infected tissue, whereas H1N1-infected tissue showed mild evidence of inflammation and was most similar to tissue from the control mice (mock-infected mice).",

We first asked whether the expression of inflammation-associated genes clustered into modules of co-expressed genes. Tissues from the same animals that were used to determine virus growth were used to evaluate changes in global lung transcriptional profiles. A total of 168 microarrays were developed (three per time point for H1N1-infected, pH1N1-infected, H5N1-infected and control mice). One microarray was removed after reviewing replicate quality. After filtering transcripts for minimally confident variation (we required at least one time-matched, infected condition compared with mock-infected absolute fold change \u2265 2 and a false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted P-value < 0.01), the log2 of the normalized intensity of the retained transcripts (16,063) for all 167 samples were then clustered by using the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm [18]. In all, 45 distinct co-expression modules were identified (referred to as N1, N2, etc.; S1 Table provides the module assignments for all transcripts). To identify the biological role of the host response modules, we performed functional enrichment analysis on each gene module by using DAVID [19] and ToppCluster [20]. Because each module was comprised of positively and negatively correlated transcripts, we used the module eigengene (i.e., the first principle component of the gene expression matrix) to divide each module into two submodules containing transcripts that were positively or negatively correlated with the parent module\u2019s eigengene, denoted as kME+ and kME- (referred to as module membership), respectively. This procedure allowed us to look for biological processes with similar but opposing dynamic responses to the virus infections. Functional enrichment analyses were then applied to each submodule by using two bioformatics platforms to ensure robust results.",

The complete enrichment results from ToppCluster and DAVID are available in S2 Table and S1 and S2 Files). The N1 module was uniquely enriched for cytokine activity and type I interferon (IFN) regulating TLR and RLR pathways [21], as well as transcriptional signatures associated with IFN-regulated activity (i.e., the transcription factor binding sites [TFBS] of Irf1, Irf7, Irf2, ISRE, and NF-\u03baB). Additionally, N1 was the only module that exhibited significant enrichment with a compendium of established IFN-stimulated genes (\u2018ISGs\u2019; Table 1; see Methods. The list of ISGs is available in S3 File). A more recent study identified 147 IFN stimulated genes in immortalized, human airway epithelial (Calu3) cells [22]. Of these, 90 mouse homologs were annotated on the microarrays and 70 of the homolog probes were assigned to the N1 module (Fisher\u2019s exact test; P-value < 10\u201316; odds ratio = 36.4), further associating N1 interferon-stimulated gene activity.",

Instead, it was primarily associated with several annotations related to leukocyte and lymphocyte activity (see summary of ToppCluster enrichment results in Table 1; see S1 and S2 Files). Further analysis with CTen [23], a platform for associating clustered gene expression data with specific cell types, found N2 to be highly enriched for genes expressed in macrophages in various cellular states (e.g., bone marrow-derived macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) (Fig 3A; additional details available in S3 Table). The remaining immune-associated submodules (the kME+ N22, N25, N31, and N35 submodules; described in Table 1) were enriched for several key immune processes such as antigen presentation, and T cell and natural killer (NK) cell activity, but their further assessment would be beyond our focus and the scope of this study.

Exudate macrophages [26] and neutrophil [27] have been identified as factors of severe disease during influenza infection. To associate gene expression dynamics with changes of immune cell counts, a new population of mice were infected with the three influenza viruses, five mice per infection group were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 and the changes in the number of macrophages and neutrophils was assessed (see Methods). Unlike the previous study by Brandes, et al. [27], strong neutrophil infiltration was not specific to fatal infections but, instead, infiltration of both cell types had a clear hierarchical relationship with the severity of the infection (Fig 3D and 3E). The N2 module eigengene exhibited a lesser correlation to virus titer (\u03c1 = 0.55), but was tightly correlated to macrophage influx into the lung (\u03c1 = 0.90; P-value < 0.01 Student\u2019s t-test). Of the 45 module identified in the studied, N2 had the highest correlation to both macrophage and neutrophil influx (the correlation of macrophage and neutrophil influx and all 45 module eigengenes are provided in S5 Table; \u03c1 = 0.80; P-value < 0.01). The N1 module on the other hand was weakly but significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration (\u03c1 = 0.67 [P-value = 0.03] for neutrophils; \u03c1 = 0.60 [P-value = 0.05] for macrophages), but its eigengene was not the most highly correlated (5 other module eigengenes had a greater absolute correlation). These results further associate N2 with immune cell-specifically macrophage- infiltration, while the sum of the bioinformatics, virus titer correlations and immune cell infiltration evidences associated N1 with inflammation and type I IFN pathway activity.",

We used the module membership (the correlation between the gene\u2019s expression and the module eigengene, kME) to isolate potential regulators of the N1 module. Among the top intramodular hub genes (i.e., genes with the highest module memberships, see S4 Table), we found Mnda, Herc6 and Cd274 and several interferon regulated, virus replication inhibitory genes such as Oas2 and Oas3 [29]. Herc6 is involved in ubiquitination [30]. Mnda is significantly up-regulated in monocytes exposed to interferon \u03b1 [31] while Cd274 is a transmembrane protein expressed on antigen presenting cells and modulates activation of T cells, B cells and myeloid cells. We also observed that interferon stimulated genes tended to have higher intramodular hub rankings, suggesting a regulatory role for interferon (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P-value < 10\u201312). We then considered the module membership rankings of transcription factors known to regulate interferon. Of the established interferon regulatory factors that are members of the N1 module (e.g., Irf1, Irf2, Irf7, Irf9, Stat1, and Stat2. Nfkb1 and Nfkb2 were not assigned to N1), Irf1 and Irf7 had the highest module memberships (kME = 0.94 and 0.93; ranking = 118 and 225, respectively). Irf7 expression was also several orders of magnitude greater than Irf1 (S4 Table). Together, these findings corroborate our bioinformatics analyses by suggesting that N1 is regulated by interferon, and N1 expression likely results in enhanced cytopatchic effects and regulation of the lymphocyte immune response. Network analysis further suggests that Irf7 may play a regulatory role upstream of interferon transcription.",

Following activation, N1 gene expression increased as a function of virus concentration at the same apparent rate for all infection conditions, and more complicated dynamics were observed only during the later phase of the infection when virus clearance was observed (i.e., when the virus titers began to decrease).

As shown in Fig 4B, ultrasensitive responses are typified by an attenuated response to low levels of stimulation but a strong response occurs once a threshold level of stimulus is reached. Cooperativity [33] and positive feedback [34] are two mechanisms that produce ultrasensitive responses. To formalize the hypothesis that the inflammatory gene response follows an ultrasensitive response profile, we selected a segmented linear model (SLM, defined in Fig 4C) to be a simplified representation of the ordinary differential equations normally used to model ultrasensitive responses, and we fit the N1 SDE to an SLM that was strictly a function of the virus titer. The optimal fit showed a threshold of 107.78\u00b10.14 PFU/g is required for N1 module activation to occur, after which the SDE\u2019s rate of activation (a2) was 0.5\u00b10.07 log10(PFU/g)-1 with an intercept (b2) of -3.8 (unitless) (see the Methods and S2 Fig for additional details). Below this threshold, the model predicted minimal gene expression (a1 = 0.17; b1 = 0.03). The SLM goodness of fit on the training data was an adjusted R2 = 0.72 while an adjusted R2 = 0.41 was observed when the data was fit to a linear model. A Davie\u2019s test confirmed that a segmented model was a significantly better fit than a linear correlation model (P-value < 2.2e-16). While the H1N1-infected lung tissue did not exceed an average peak virus titer of 107.4 PFU/g (peak titer occurs at 48 hpi in Fig 4A), we observed increased transcriptional activity in H1N1-infected mouse lung tissues after this time point, suggesting either that the actual peak virus titer occurred between 48 hpi and the subsequent time point (60 hpi), or that the model-predicted threshold was slightly over-approximated.",

For this, we selected the H5N1 virus, which has previously been associated with an excessive cytokine response [10]. We infected mice with 103 PFU of the H5N1 virus (a 100-fold reduced dose compared with that used in the experiments to fit the model), determined lung virus titers at the same time points used for the initial experiment (S3 Fig), and then evaluated the segmented linear model\u2019s ability to predict cytokine-associated gene expression. First, we confirmed that the original transcripts assigned to the N1 module were again co-expressed, and thus we used the same transcripts originally assigned to the N1 module to determine the eigengene (see S4 Fig for an analysis of the conservation of the N1 module between the two experiments). In this experiment, as expected, the peak average virus titer (109.3\u00b10.21 PFU/g) for the 103 PFU dose was delayed compared with that for the 105 PFU dose (S3 Fig, compare to Fig 1). Moreover, the SDE exhibited an 18-h delay in activation and a 42-h delay in peak expression compared with the 105 PFU N1 eigengene (Fig 4D). Importantly, based on the virus titers alone, the fitted segmented linear model accurately predicted N1-like SDE behavior (R2 = 0.71 for all time points and R2 = 0.87 for time points up to peak expression; Fig 4E and S5 Fig), and this could be further demonstrated at the individual gene level for specific N1-associated transcripts (e.g., Herc6, Stat1 and Irf7; Fig 4F). These observations provide strong evidence that activation of inflammatory-associated gene expression is dictated by a specific virus concentration in infected tissue, and further suggest the novel possibility that the pulmonary innate inflammatory response has a nonlinear, ultrasensitive-like activation profile that promotes tolerance to low concentrations of virus.",

Indeed, of the 17 cytokines associated with the N1 module, 15\u2014including key inflammatory proteins, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)\u2014were significantly correlated with the N1 module eigengene (Pearson\u2019s \u03c1\u22650.5; FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.01; see S6 Table). In addition, when the protein expression levels of these 15 cytokines were plotted against the corresponding titer data, we observed dynamics similar to that of the inflammatory-associated N1 gene module. Initially, protein expression was low but strongly increased only after the virus titers exceeded the threshold of ~108 PFU/gram determined in the gene regulation model (Fig 5A). In contrast, most of the protein levels of the other measured cytokines with transcripts that were not assigned to the N1 module did not show any obvious relationship to the proposed threshold response (S6 Fig). The only major exceptions were LIF, RANTES, and IL18 (S6 Fig). LIF\u2019s gene transcript was not annotated on the arrays whereas IL18\u2019s transcript was not identified as differentially expressed and therefore was not included in the clustering study. The RANTES transcript was included in the clustering study and assigned by the WGCNA algorithm to N2 although the transcript\u2019s correlation to the N1 eigengene suggests it could also have been assigned to the N1 module (Pearson correlation = 0.84 and 0.89 to the N1 and N2 eigengene, respectively). Some proteins appeared to conform to the threshold model in pH1N1-infected, but not H1N1- or H5N1-infected, mice. These may be cytokines that have strain-dependent responses and do not conform to the model. Overall, changes in N1-associated cytokine protein levels in influenza virus-infected mouse lungs were consistent with the proposed virus-titer regulated threshold-mechanism underlying the IFN-mediated response.",

Images of representative blots are available in S9 Fig). Significant increases in the concentration of IFN-\u03b1 and phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) were detectable in infections with all three virus isolates and occurred at time points after the threshold level of virus was exceeded (Fig 5B). For the H1N1 data, significant levels of pSTAT1 were observed at 36 hpi which\u2014as noted previously\u2014corresponds to the time immediately after the virus titers in H1N1-infected mice reached their peak (see previous discussion). On the other hand, significant increases in phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3) were observed only in pH1N1 and H5N1 infections, whereas significant increases in IFN-\u03b2 were observed only in the H5N1 infection. Changes in the levels of IFN-\u03b2 and pIRF3 occurred after significant increases in pSTAT1 and IFN-\u03b1 occurred. As such, the change in the percentage of pSTAT1 was more closely correlated to the N1 eigengene than was that of pIRF3 (correlation = 0.77\u00b10.06 and 0.67\u00b10.09 respectively), and significant increases in pSTAT1 corresponded to time points at which the mean virus titer exceeded the threshold level identified in the gene expression analysis (~107.78 PFU/g). The greater correlation of IFN\u03b1 and STAT1 activation to the inflammation-associated, N1 module\u2019s gene expression dynamics and the enrichment of the N1 module for the IRF7 binding sequence (Table 1) suggest that the primary driver of the threshold-regulated, inflammatory gene response originates along the IRF7 \u2192 IFN-\u03b1 \u2192 STAT1 axis (Fig 5C).",

Threshold-like and ultrasensitive mechanisms are hypothesized to be necessary for effective management of critical cellular machinery in noisy environments, and are recognized players in the activation of the cell cycle [34], mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling [35], and apoptosis [33,36].

            "text": "The ultrasensitive response observed in this study provides additional insight into the mechanisms that drive severe pathologies during influenza infection. Several works have suggested that viral load is a key determinant of pathology [12,15] while other works suggest that highly pathogenic influenza viruses induce early, strong inflammatory responses that are independent of the viral load [9,24,37]. Recently, it was observed that fatal influenza infections in mice coincide with a strong influx of neutrophils in what the author\u2019s describe as a viral load-independent, \u201cfeedforward\u201d inflammatory circuit [27]. The ultrasensitive response suggested by our study consolidates these hypotheses by suggesting that viral load drives cytokine production (and in turn immune cell infiltration) in a nonlinear manner which is capable of producing states of high and low innate immune responses. Characterization of key aspects of the inflammatory response, such as the onset and peak inflammatory gene expression, require a high temporal resolution of the virus growth and host response dynamics; an experimental design that was unique to our study. The ultrasensitive response model does not negate the significance of neutrophil infiltration [27] in determining fatal infections but suggests that viral load drives the high and low innate immune states. The observed threshold may represent the transition to immunopathology; as indicated by the histopathology results (Fig 2). Moreover, the influenza virus\u2019 NS1 protein is crucial for inhibiting the interferon-mediated antiviral response [38]. The NS1 protein of three viruses used in this study have the SUMO1 acceptor site that indicates interferon antagonism capability [39\u201341]. Additional studies with NS1-mutated viruses and other pathogens may better reveal strain-dependencies for the observed thresholding behavior.",

Interestingly, after the threshold was exceeded, the rate of activation for inflammatory and interferon-associated gene expression (N1) was conserved for a moderately pathogenic and deadly viruses (Fig 4A). The conserved rate of activation implies that the immune response detects the virus concentration but not the virus growth rate; suggesting the innate immune response is naturally limited in its ability to respond to high growth influenza viruses. Additionally, studies in knockout mice indicate that type I IFN-associated pathways are essential for protection during primary infection [42] and that earlier initiation of these pathways coincides with increased survival in mice infected with highly pathogenic isolates [43]. In combination with these studies, the findings here suggest a novel means of protecting high risk groups by treating them with compounds that target the molecular mechanisms responsible for the threshold behavior. Lowering the threshold required to induce the cytokine response may be a means of providing protection from severe influenza infection. Since these compounds would target host proteins, such treatments would be effective against various influenza virus strains. Data from the viruses studied here suggest that post-threshold, inflammatory gene expression primarily reflects interferon-regulated tissue damage, but time-course data from additional highly pathogenic viruses are needed to assess the degree to which interferon activity is associated with virus growth suppression.",

Only significant changes are shown in the heat map (FDR-adjusted P-value < 0.05 relative to mock-infected samples). Titers highlighted in red indicate that the threshold level (as determined in the initial analysis) was exceeded. Panel (c) shows a schematic of known canonical pathways that regulate IFN production in response to virus infection. Black arrows denote induction whereas red lines denote points at which influenza virus is known to impair these pathways. IFN-\u03b1 is primarily produced by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) whereas IFN-\u03b2 is produced in virus-infected, non-APC cells. Both IFNs can induce STAT1 phosphorylation and expression of ISGs in responding cells.",
