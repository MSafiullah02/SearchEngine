The limitations of such treatment have underscored the need to develop more effective strategies to control the spread and pathogenesis of infection. In 1996, the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) commenced in established market economies, causing a dramatic reduction in morbidity and mortality in those infected individuals who received these medicines. These agents target aspects of the viral life cycle and there are now 20 approved therapeutic agents for licensed for treatment of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a pathogen that in the 1980s was uniformly fatal. These advances have been associated with significant toxicities and drug resistance. Antiviral potency and durability causing suppression of viremia has been the cornerstone of the initial success of HAART regimens. Following this, the restoration of immune function, the prevention of the emergence of resistance, and ultimately the prevention of disease progression has been the focus of treatment. Future progress will allow greater choices for physicians and patients.",

A major side effect of this drug is an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction which may be fatal if the patient is re-challenged following cessation of therapy. The hypersensitivity reaction is easy to recognize with prominent respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, a fever and usually a rash. Discontinuation of therapy results in rapid improvement in symptomatology but rechallenge is strongly contra-indicated. The CPK is often greatly raised during an attack. A widespread physician and patient educational programme has ensured that this condition is recognized. The hypersensitivity reaction is very strongly associated with the ancestral haplotype B5701 (Hetherington et al., 2002) . Whether this should be used as a screening test prior to introduction of therapy is unclear and the association is not sufficiently strong to use this as a test to diagnose a hypersensitivity reaction. This drug is prescribed twice a day but intracellular pharmacokinetics indicate that the triphosphate levels of the drug are maintained throughout a 24 hour period and as studies comparing twice a day with once a day regimens indicated a similar drop in plasma HIV viral load, it may be licensed for once a day use in the future.",

It is relatively free of side effects. Although the licensed dose is 150 mg twice a day, the long intracellular half-life of the triphosphate component indicates it can probably be used once a day.

Two mechanisms of resistance development are now clearly understood. With some drugs like 3TC the development of resistance by the virus involves mutations which increase the affinities to the natural nucleoside substrates at the expense of the drug. For other drugs resistance involves conformational changes which encourage the removal of the chain terminating nucleoside analogue once it is attached. The process of reverse transcriptation and elongation of the DNA chain is a reversible process. The nucleoside is substituted for by a phosphorus molecule either donated from pyrophosphate (pyrophosphorylisis) or from ATP. This process of reversal of chain termination is exaggerated in resistant mutant viruses. Tenofovir still acts as a chain terminator with some AZT resistant viruses because this reversal process is inefficient, presumably because of the particular structure of tenofovir. ",

Clinical utility was rapidly confirmed by three clinical end point studies. One showed an improved outcome in late disease when ritonavir was added to otherwise failing therapy. A second showed a reduced frequency in clinical end points when a regimen of indinavir and two nucleoside analogues was compared with using the nucleoside analogues alone (Hammer et al., 1997) . Although protease inhibitors are potent drugs, they have a number of potential disadvantages. Most have short half-lives and have to be taken several times during the day. Absorption through the gut mucosa is often variable producing wide intrapatient and inter-patient variability in plasma levels.

The first important positive controlled trial of non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was with nevirapine which demonstrated that in a regimen also containing zidovudine and didanosine, there was a superior surrogate marker outcome compared to the use of the two nucleosides alone. This study was followed by a comparison of zidovudine and lamivudine with efavirenz and indinavir with the same nucleoside analogues which showed an equivalent or superior surrogate marker response at 48 weeks for the NNRTI containing regimen . Nevertheless both efavirenz and nevirapine have established an important role in the initial treatment of HIV infection because of their freedom from irritating toxicities associated with drug administration and their relatively long half life (efavirenz is taken once a day and nevirapine which is licensed for twice a day is often used once a day).

All recent studies of antiretroviral therapy have used these surrogate markers to assess likely clinical effectiveness. Preventing HIV viral replication as completely as possible has always been regarded as important and, therefore, particular attention has been paid to the ability of drugs in combinations to reduce plasma levels of HIV below detectable limits of sensitive assays, (currently less than 50 copies per ml). Many clinicians thus believe that the most important outcome of a clinical trial is the proportion of individuals who have a below 50 copy HIV-1 RNA assay using an intent to treat analysis at 48 weeks.

Data from several cohort studies with short term follow-up have suggested that patients who initiate therapy when the CD4 count is <200 cells/mm 3 have an increased mortality ( Hogg and Wood, 2001; Sterling et al., 2001; Kaplan and Karon, 2001 ) compared with those above this level, but were unable to show any difference in those starting at any CD4 level >200 cells/mm 3 . However, data from other cohort studies (Phillips et al., 2000) suggest that patients who delay therapy until the CD4 lymphocyte count is <200 cells/mm 3 may have a similar virological and immunological response to those starting earlier. This is in contrast to data from prospective clinical studies (Wood and Team, 2000; Opravil et al., 2001) , although the effect of baseline CD4 response on therapy may not be the same for all drugs (Nelson et al., 2001) . One study (Nelson et al., 2001) has suggested that patients who commenced therapy with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm 3 were less likely than those who commenced later to experience disease progression or death.",

A number of factors need to be considered when making decisions with each individual patient. Patients with a rapidly falling CD4 count (e.g. falling >80 cells/mm 3 per year on repeated testing) have an increased risk of CD4 cell count decline to <200 cells/mm 3 in the next 6 months. This group many thus be considered for initiation of therapy relatively earlier within the CD4 count range 200-350 cells/mm 3 . Previous guidelines have suggested starting therapy relatively early in patients with a high plasma viral load (Carpenter et al., 2000) . There are three reasons why viral load measurement should help guide decisions about when to start antiretroviral therapy. First, a viral load >55000 copies/ml (Mellors et al. (2000) predicts a faster rate of decline in CD4 cells. Second, this level of viral load is an independent risk factor for subsequent disease progression and death. However, these data are from an era before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and may not be relevant. Furthermore, recent cohort studies (Sterling et al., 2001; Kaplan et al., 2001) have suggested that baseline viral load does not predict subsequent mortality independently of the baseline CD4 count after starting therapy. Third, some data have suggested that the baseline viral load adversely affects the virological response to treatment in some prospective studies Moyle and Opravil, 2000) .",

Even in these patients the death rate is low providing the CD4 count is maintained above 50 cells/mm 3 . It is clear that continuing therapy is beneficial compared with discontinuing, presumably because viral mutations which are less sensitive to drugs are also less virulent and therefore have less effect on reducing the CD4 count. Thus in these individuals, there is a paradigm switch of treatment from trying to make the viral load undetectable (which is not possible) to one in which the CD4 count is kept as high as possible for as long as possible. In this situation some clinicians believe that the minimum number of drugs to continue to give those viruses which are resistant already in the circulation a continuing survival advantage, whereas others believe that large numbers of drugs, even though they may have little effect individually are beneficial overall. The disadvantage of this latter mega HAART approach is increased toxicity, a large pill burden and unexpected pharmacokinetic interactions. It is likely that this is the stage at which T20 would be prescribed but it only has an evanescent effect if it is the only active drug in the regime. Thus it is probably better to use T20 in the last regime at which undetectability is likely to be achieved.

The commonest chemokine receptor utilised is CCR5 and a number of compounds capable of inhibiting this interaction are now in various stages of development, the most advanced of which is now in phase 3 study. Obviously only individuals who harbour viruses which is CCR5 trophic are likely to respond to this drug and the long term side effects of inhibiting one of the body's receptors is unknown although a large deletion within this receptor which renders it inactive is a common balanced polymorphism in European communities without major untoward effects. The virus also is capable of utilising the CXCR4 receptor present particularly on CD4 cells and such viruses are associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS. Although there have been worries that the use of CCR5 inhibitors may encourage the virus to mutate to become CXCR4 trophic, there is limited evidence in vivo as yet that this is the case. CXCR4 inhibitors are also being developed but these are at an earlier stage of evolution. Fusion inhibitors represent an excellent example of where detailed knowledge of the processes involved in HIV replication have led to specific drug design. T20 represents the first of a new series of fusion inhibitors. This peptide was specifically designed to interact with helical portions of GP41 which contract during the process of fusion to draw the surface of GP120 into close proximity with the host cell, allowing interaction with the T cell receptor and the chemokine receptors. T20 is administered subcutaneously twice a day and is effective in salvage therapy. It was used as additional therapy to standard care in patients who failed all three classes of drugs where marked viral load drops (1 log) which persisted for up to 48 weeks were seen. Virological failure in patients taking T20 is associated with mutations in the relevants portions of GP41. A new form of this drug which can be administered once a day is also being developed. As often happens during drug development the optimum role for this drug which is likely to be licensed soon remains unclear. Most clinicians would like to combine T20 with other drugs which are also likely to be effective to reduce viral replication to undetectable levels eg tenofovir and lopinavir boosted with ritonavir in individuals following initial PI failure.",

Interestingly this occurred after a one to two day lag period following administration.

More recent in vitro studies and limited human experiments have not indicated that this is likely to happen. Unfortunately the main drug which is being developed to inhibit the interaction between HIV and CXCR4, AMD310, which has to be administered intravenously, showed very little effect in Phase 1 human studies (Dameta et al., 1996) .

It has activity against viruses with reduced sensitivity to the presently available NNRTI. It is likely to be given three times a day and will require ritonavir boosting to produce acceptable drug levels. Drug development was suspended until recently because of a vasculitis noticed at high dosages in dogs. However, in lower dosages comparable to those given to patients, no vasculitis was seen and so development has now been allowed to continue. The role of this drug which requires remains unclear but one obvious use would be in individuals failing initial NNRTIs in whom standard therapy at the moment would be a ritonavir boosted PI, and adding capavirene to this regime might increase potency.",

There are many contributing factors to this increased demand, including the ever-increasing prevalence of chronic viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis B as well as the emergence of new viruses such as the SARS coronavirus. The weaknesses of current drugs in the treatment of HIV are being tackled with new targeted therapies. Because of their early stage of development, the question of improved tolerance remains largely unanswered for most of these compounds and many such drugs will undoubtedly fall by the wayside, however some, will become new and valuable treatments.",
