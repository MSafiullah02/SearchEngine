            "text": "Micro\u2010organisms are ubiquitous in our environment. Although many are harmless and even beneficial, some are well\u2010known pathogens while others can elicit allergic responses in humans. Casual contact with surfaces and objects contaminated with infectious droplets (i.e. fomites) is an established route for transmission of many diseases (Pruss et al. 1999). Maintaining clean and pathogen\u2010free surfaces is necessary in controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Metal surfaces containing silver, copper and brass possess intrinsic germicidal properties that can kill many pathogenic micro\u2010organisms upon contact. They are commonly known as \u2018contact\u2010killing\u2019 surfaces (Fang 1997; Block 2001). Similarly, chromium and nickel in stainless steel and zinc in galvanized iron are known to inhibit microbial growth (Fang 1997). Nanosilvers (Fu et al. 2006; Yu et al. 2007), photocatalytic TiO2 (Sunada et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2007) and surface\u2010tethered bactericides (e.g. quarternary ammonium compounds, phosphonium salts) (Isquith et al. 1972; Cen et al. 2003; Popa et al. 2003) are among the new generation of contact\u2010killing, antimicrobial surface coatings developed in recent years. Nonmetals such as ceramics and enamels whose surfaces are physically nonadhesive and resist biofilm formation are also extensively used in sanitary settings. Microbes adhere poorly to ultra\u2010hydrophobic surfaces and bacteria\u2010repelling poly(ethylene glycol) (Desai et al. 1992). However, the antimicrobial properties of these materials diminish rapidly when the surface is fouled by dirt and contaminants, thus requiring frequent cleaning to maintain their effectiveness.",

For example, a chlorine dioxide (ClO2) biocide is generated from the reaction between stored sodium chlorite salt and acids released from a polymer matrix by either hydrolysis or photolysis reactions (Callerame 1989; Wellinghoff 1997). The latest developments in new antimicrobial coatings are oriented towards multiple mechanistic approaches for surface disinfection. Cohen\u2019s group (Li et al. 2006) employed layer\u2010by\u2010layer, self\u2010assembly methods to produce antibacterial coatings capable of both release\u2010killing and contact\u2010killing based on stored silver salts and surface\u2010grafted quarternary ammonium. Ho et al. (2004) used a polymer film to immobilize nanosilver to achieve both contact\u2010 and release\u2010killing effects, while a grafted layer of polyethylene glycol repelled the adhesion of bacteria.",

Released as a gas, the antimicrobial action of ClO2 is less affected by dirt and surface fouling. The gaseous ClO2 was originally used for large\u2010scale disinfection by bottling companies and as a replacement for the more toxic chlorine in drinking water treatment. The successful stabilization of ClO2 in liquid form has resulted in broad applications, including the use of a ClO2 fumigant to disinfect the air ducts in the US Capitol following the Anthrax episode in 2001 (Gordon and Rosenblatt 2005). ClO2 is safe compared with other oxidizing disinfectants (e.g. chlorine and ozone) and is approved by US FDA for disinfection of poultry and beef products, fruits and vegetables.",

The glass was cut into 2\u00b75 \u00d7 2\u00b75 cm2 pieces and prepared according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) guideline (2005a). Any defective glass was eliminated and the remaining substrates were rinsed once with distilled water and thrice with ethanol (99\u00b79%; Merck) followed by another rinse with excess amounts of distilled water.

It is safe (McDonnel and Russell 1999) and effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, spores and viruses over a wide pH range from 2 to 8 (Huang et al. 1997; Young and Setlow 2003; Sy et al. 2005; Simonet and Gantzer 2006). The disinfection ability of ClO2 has also been reported for B. anthrax cells and spores (Canter et al. 2005), the severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus (Wang et al. 2005) and the influenza A virus (H1N1) (Ogata and Shibata 2005). ClO2 is a very reactive free radical molecule. Owing to its unique one\u2010electron transfer reaction mechanism, it is also a highly selective oxidant (Gordon and Rosenblatt 2005). It attacks electron\u2010rich centres in organic molecules (Gordon and Rosenblatt 2005) and kills micro\u2010organisms through oxidizing their cell membranes (Berg et al. 1986) and denaturing their proteins (Ogata 2007). It breaks the inner membrane of spores preventing their proper germination (Young and Setlow 2003) and reacts with the viral envelope to cause irreparable damage and inactivation (Ogata and Shibata 2005). ClO2 solution can be applied or sprayed directly onto the target surface for action. The disinfection ability, however, diminishes with time in terms of minutes as the ClO2 vaporizes. In enabling a longer lasting disinfection performance, ClO2 gas was generated from sodium chlorite salts stored in a polymer matrix through a reaction with an acid (Callerame 1989; Wellinghoff 1997), and the acid was either stored with the salt or formed as byproduct of polymer decomposition. This process is inevitably slow as the generation of ClO2 gas depends on the release or production of acid and its subsequent reaction with sodium chlorite.",

Also, their responsiveness to different environmental cues such as temperature, pH and moisture has been amply demonstrated for controlled drug delivery (Tarcha 1991; Sosnik and Cohn 2004). The emulsion was readily sprayable and with the Pluronic polymers acting as a surfactant. The emulsion droplets deposited uniformly on surfaces as shown by the SEM picture in Fig. 1b.

Assuming that there is a constant rate of ClO2 release from the polymer, the coating prepared in this study can optimally last for 3 months. The P123 polymer does not favour a fast transport route via inverted micelles of encapsulates in the oil phase (Matsumoto and Kang 1989;Sela et al. 1995). Studies showed that molecules can migrate through the oil phase without affecting the double emulsion stability (Bibette et al. 1999). The ClO2 encapsulated in this study is likely transported from the interior of the polymer to the peripheral surfaces via diffusion, resulting in a sustained release of ClO2 over the 28\u2010day study period.",

The amount of B. subtilis killed was comparable with that killed after exposure to 300 ppm ClO2 solution. The relative susceptibility of B. subtilis spores and the range of bacteria killed followed with the trend reported by Russell (2003). Gram\u2010negative E. coli was most susceptible and endospores of B. subtilis were the least susceptible (2, 3). Staphylococcus aureus was the least susceptible to ClO2 among the tested vegetative species. Staphylococcus aureus also exhibited similar low susceptibility to a hypochlorite (i.e. bleach) solution (data not shown). This may be related to the presence of carotenoid pigments in Staph. aureus that are antioxidative and provide the bacteria with some degree of protection from oxidizing biocides (Clauditz et al. 2006).",

This trend favours the use of the encapsulated coating as an antimicrobial surface. Under ambient conditions, droplets or fomites from whatever source will be deposited onto surfaces and remain on the site until they are transferred to other surfaces or objects after contact. This means that there is ample time for the ClO2 to act on the species resting on the coating. We speculate that the bactericidal or sporicidal activity is caused by multiple actions of the coating. Primarily, both dissolved and gaseous ClO2 is released through diffusion from the ClO2 encapsulated in the polymer matrix. In addition, the coating is rehydrated by droplets or fomites upon deposition. This rehydration destabilizes the outermost membrane film of the coating, resulting in its rupture and rapid flooding of the contact area with the encapsulated ClO2. The release is sustained by the difference in the osmotic pressures between the exterior and interior water phases of the polymer formulation. The rehydration thus initiates the sporadic release of ClO2 in addition to the usual release\u2010killing mechanism employed by antimicrobial systems using ClO2 (Callerame 1989; Wellinghoff 1997). This sporadic release potential gives the coating the advantage of self\u2010disinfection of areas contaminated by droplets or fomites.",

            "text": "Formation of biofilms is detrimental to the coating surface. Phenotypic tolerance to oxidizing biocide can arise from biofilm formation via consumption of the biocide by the organic constituents of the biofilm (Chen and Stewart 1996), or by a \u2018population\u2010based\u2019 resistance strategy (Cochran et al. 2000). No biofilm was observed in this reported polymeric matrix coating. The active biocide, ClO2, used in the formulation prevents indiscriminate reactions and rapid consumption of ClO2 by the biofilm because of rapid diffusion (Hosni et al. 2006) and greater reaction selectivity (Gordon and Rosenblatt 2005). The absence of a biofilm may also be due to the antiadhesive properties of the P123 and P127 polymers that prevent the adhesion both of the Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative bacteria (e.g. B. subtilis and E. coli) on its surface (Fig. 5). The chance of seeding a biofilm on the coating is also reduced. The antiadhesive property of the polymers is probably related to the anchorage of the hydrophobic core of the triblock polymers on the material surface, while its hydrophilic chains form sterically stabilized barriers against adhesion in the periphery (Bridgett et al. 1992). The antiadhesive property of the coating surface reduces the chance of the coating degeneration as a result of biofilm formation and allows the coating surface to be a self\u2010maintaining bactericidal system.",
