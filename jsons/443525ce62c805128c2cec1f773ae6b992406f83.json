Several corrections that enrich the information which may be derived from the alignment methods are proposed. The corrections take into account the distributions along the sequences of the aligned bases (neglected in the standard alignment methods). As a consequence, different aspects of similarity, as for example asymmetry of the gene structure, may be studied either using new similarity measures associated with four-component spectral representation of the DNA sequences or using alignment methods with corrections introduced in this paper. The corrections to the alignment methods and the statistical distribution moment-based descriptors derived from the four-component spectral representation of the DNA sequences are applied to similarity/dissimilarity studies of \u03b2-globin gene across species. The studies are supplemented by detailed similarity studies for histones H1 and H4 coding sequences. The data are described according to the latest version of the EMBL database. The work is supplemented by a concise review of the state-of-art graphical representations of DNA sequences.",

The hypothetical model sequences consist of independent equidistributed symbols with randomly interspersed repeats. The model that can be analyzed analytically predicts that the entropy of DNA sequences measuring the information content is much lower than suggested by earlier empirical studies.",

            "text": "Statistical studies aiming at characterization of correlation structures of DNA sequences has been a subject of many studies (for review see [4, 5] ). In particular Foss [6] using spectral density of individual base positions demonstrated long-range fractal correlations as well as short-range periodicities. Arneodo et al. [7] used the wavelet transform to demonstrate the existence of long-correlations in genes containing introns and noncoding regions. Buldyrev et al. [8] in order to answer the question in computational molecular biology whether long-range correlations are present in both coding and noncoding DNA sequences have used standard Fourier transform analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis. For that purpose, the authors performed analysis of the sequences available in GenBank in 1995. For noncoding sequences, they obtained the presence of long-range correlations. Azbel in his work [9] demonstrated a universality in a DNA statistical structure using an autocorrelation function. However, no long-range correlations have been found in any of the studied DNA sequences. Peng et.al. [10] studied long-range correlations by constructing a map of the nucleotide sequence onto a walk which they referred to as a DNA walk. Using such an approach they found long-range correlations in intron-containing genes and in nontranscribed regulatory DNA sequences, but not in complementary DNA sequence or intron-less genes. Visualization technique proposed by Peng et al. is based on a one dimensional DNA walk showing the relative occurrence of purines and pyrimidynes along the sequence. Silverman and Linsker introduced vectorial representation of the bases in three dimensions [11] . They used the unit vectors of 3D space to construct a Fourier transform. Such Fourier transform graphs representing the sequences were used as measures of DNA periodicity. Another visualization technique based on DNA walk plotted in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system has been introduced by Berger [5] . In his work Berger gave also a good review of visualization techniques based on DNA walk and their applications for an analysis of DNA sequences i.e. a study of correlation information, sequence periodicities, and other sequence characteristics. More examples of studies focused on statistical properties of DNA sequences and also on their biological interpretation may be found in [12, 13] .",

            "text": "This work is focused on graphical representations of DNA sequences. Biological sequences are often very long, and it is not obvious how to represent them graphically in an easy way that shows the main features of these objects. The size of the plots is restricted by the human abilities of perception. How to restrict the graphs representing the sequences to two-dimensional plots and how to avoid degeneracies has been the subject of numerous studies which resulted in many graphical representations (see subsequent chapters). Graphical representations offer both numerical and visualization tool for similarity/dissimilarity analysis. These methods are still restricted to small groups of users. Computing codes calculating optimal sequence alignment are implemented using dynamic programming and are freely accessible in the internet and that makes them attractive for potential users. However, they are computationally expensive, and methodologically offer too simplistic similarity/dissimilarity analysis. They restrict the multidimensional similarity space of complex objects and show only one aspect of similarity. It becomes more and more popular to replace the alignment methods by alternative ones. In particular, H\u00f6nl and Ragan consider numerical alignment-free methods that can replace multiple-sequence alignment to infer a phylogenetic tree that represents the history of a set of molecular sequences [37] . Graphical representations have been also used for the construction of phylogenetic trees. Since multiple alignment strategy does not work for all types of data, Liao et al. [38] proposed to use the similarity matrix based on their 2D graphical representation of DNA sequences [39] to construct phylogenetic tree. The authors consider mitochondrial sequences belonging to different species. The same graphical representation has been also used by the authors to obtain the phylogenetic relationships of H5N1 avian influenza virus [40] and the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses [41] . Another 2D graphical representation [42] has been used by Yu et al. to construct the phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses and lentiviruses [43] . 3D graphical representation has been also used to construct a phylogenetic tree [44] . Wang and Zhang studied molecular phylogeny of H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Asia using 2D and 3D graphical representations of DNA sequences [45] . Graphical representations of DNA sequences have been also generalized for the analysis of similarity/dissimilarity between RNA secondary structures, as for example [46, 47] . 2D graphical representation has been used for the characterization of the neuraminidase RNA sequences of H5N1 [48, 49] and of H1N1 [50] strains. Also graphical representations of the proteins have been created [51] [52] [53] [54] .",

Similarity analysis is not unique to sequences in biology. For instance, the problem of similarity has been developed and applied in computational pharmacology and has resulted in methods such as QSAR, QSPR [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] which aim at the prediction of molecular properties. The basic paradigm of quantitative structure-property relationship (QSAR) is that compounds with similar structure have similar properties. This implies a smooth transient behavior in the relation between structure and property/activity, i.e., for any small change in the structure, the magnitude of the physico-chemical property or biological activity changes smoothly rather than in an abrupt, in all-or-none type, way. The molecular similarity measures are based on a large number of descriptors, i.e. of the numerical indices characterizing molecules. The basis for these studies is the development of various kinds of mathematical descriptors [62, 63] . In the theory of molecular similarity it is commonly accepted that different descriptors and different similarity measures reveal different aspects of similarity. A pair of complex objects may be similar in one aspect and not similar in another aspect. Using different similarity measures, usually one obtains contradictory results which may be relevant in different contexts. The first QSAR studies on biological sequences using graphical representations of sequences have been already performed [64] .",

[66] . Another important problem is to identify protein coding regions of genomic sequences [67, 68] . First attempts of identifying protein coding genes using graphical representations of DNA sequences based on Z curve [69] or based on trinucleotides [70] have been already performed. It has been shown that the similarity relations are different for exons, and sequences with introns using the four-component spectral representation (see subsequent chapters).

In the first case, the A bases are spread over the whole sequence (positions 1, 3 give non-zero contributions). In the second case, the A bases are cumulated. In this sense, the alignment methods are degenerate: different structures give the same result. Then, in the alignment methods these structures are undistinguishable. This is certainly one of the weakest points of the alignment methods. The degree of degeneracy may be very large and increases with the lengths of the sequences. Obviously, the degree of degeneracy in the model example is larger than 2. One can add more than two cases that give the same score as the two model cases.

In a way this is an inverse problem to the one from which the statistical spectroscopy originated: from global characteristics of the eigenvalues one tries to obtain some information about details of the spectrum. Examples of generating individual energy levels using methods of statistical spectroscopy may be found in the theory of nuclear, atomic, molecular, and solid-state spectra [76] [77] [78] . Approximating the eigenvalues by statistical quantities (spectral density distribution moments) is not limited by dimensions of the matrices and that is an advantage comparing to the standard methods based on diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. In particular, we have studied statistical properties of spectra of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian [78] . The distribution of the eigenvalues have been found to be Gaussian-like, well approximated by several-term Gram-Charlier expansions [79] . The exact spectra (obtained by the diagonalizations of the Hamiltonian matrices) have been compared with the ones derived from the moment-generated spectral density distributions. This approximation gives a very good description of the spectrum in its central part however, as one should expect, deteriorates at the extremes. Relations between the exact and the moment-generated spectra are analyzed for several kinds of the lattices as a function of the number of moments. It has been observed that the quality of the statistical description improves with an increase of the dimension of the problem and with a lowering of the symmetry of the lattice.",

Initially, the method of generating of envelopes of the intensities has been introduced for the transitions in crystals [84] and in atoms [85] . Replacing the calculations line by line by the statistical approach with much shorter computing time became also attractive in molecular physics. The shape of a molecular band may be defined as an envelope of the rovibrational lines which constitute the band. The method of determining the shapes of molecular electronic bands consists of several steps. First the expressions for the intensity distribution moments for the considered system are derived. Then these expressions are used to calculate the moments corresponding to the solution of the pertinent quantum chemical model. Finally, a smooth function for which several lowest moments are equal to the exact ones, is derived. This function is an approximation to the envelope of the electronic band in a molecular spectrum. In particular, I have used this algorithm to derive the intensity spectrum corresponding to the transitions in H 2 molecule using 3-moment trial function [86] . In that paper I have also shown that the quality of the approximation depends on the choice of the trial function rather than on the number of moments taken into account. Adding moments of the order higher than 4 does not improve the results when the Gram-Charlier expansion is taken as the trial function. This process may even be divergent. In some cases a 4-moment Gram-Charlier expansion may give worse results than the 3-moment one. For example, this happens in a spectrum derived from a model based on the harmonic oscillator potential. In the case of H 2 molecule a non-standard 3-moment trial function has to be applied in order to get a high quality approximation of the spectrum (treated as a statistical distribution).",

For the symmet- ric distributions, in particular if identical sequences are compared, 3 is equal to zero. It is negative for the left-skewed distributions and positive for right-skewed distributions. One can observe, that the asymmetry of the aligned distributions for Exon 1 C DS (Table 5) is different from the one for Exon 2 C DS ( Table 9 ). The number of the negative values of 3 is 41 for Exon 1 C DS and 21 for Exon 2 C DS . For example, in the case of human-mouse sequences, 3 is negative for Exon 1 C DS and it is positive for Exon 2 C DS . Another similarity measure independent of the lengths of the sequences is 4 . This is the kurtosis parameter, that is the measure of the peakedness of the distribution. Analogously as for the lower order moments, 4 is different for different parts of a gene (Tables 6, 10). For example, the similarity measure based on 4 for galluslemur sequences is 1.86 for Exon 1 C DS and 1.70 for Exon 2 C DS . The similarity relations based on 4 between all the sequences are shown in Fig. 1 . The horizontal axis represents the values listed in Table 6 Table 5 versus values listed in Table 7 ( Fig. 2, panel b) and the values listed in Table 9 versus values listed in Table 11 means that the information coming from 5 is similar to the one coming from 3 . Therefore, the corrections 5 can be neglected.

The shapes of the curves were determined by a walk in a space spanned by four vectors that represent the four bases. In the first article on this subject, Hamori proposed a graphical representation method in which the information about the DNA sequence has been mapped into a three-dimensionalspace curve. A unit vector of a characteristic direction has been assigned to each of the four nucleotides: adenine A, cytosine C, thymine T, and guanine G. In this approach the shape of the curve (called H-curve) representing the sequence of nucleotides is obtained by joining the vectors in the order of the nucleotides in the sequence. Changing the resolution one can see short-range details or global trends of the distribution of nucleotides. For example, H-curve is shifted in characteristic direction if the sequence is rich in certain nucleotides. It is also easy to recognize the locations of the repeating elements in the sequence. The first mathematical representation Hamori also published in Nature in 1985 under the title \"Novel DNA sequence representation\" [91] .",

According to the authors such a change allows to exhibit the distribution of purines (A and G) and pyrimidines (C and T). The authors noticed that some information may be lost if a walk moves several times over the same ground. However, the authors found a good solution to identify in the plot the regions in which the parts of the sequences are hidden: the scale is visible even for long sequences and the numbers that label the bases in the plot are pointed every one hundred. The authors have not proposed any numerical characteristics and a way of indication in the plot of the hidden parts (by labeling or coloring) seems to be a good solution.

Labeling and coloring only approximately localizes the regions in the sequences where the hidden parts are located. A 2D walk does not retain the history of the graph. This is not a linear method: A particular part of the graph may come from different parts of the sequences. The advantage is a small size of the graph representing long sequences and very often the information coming from such a plot may be sufficient. In order to eliminate, or to minimize, the degeneracy caused by the repetitive walks, many different methods have been introduced. For example, Guo et al. [95] introduced a new graphical representation, also based on a walk in 2D space changing the angles between the basis vectors: the four nucleic acid bases are represented by the vectors: A by \u22121, 1 d ; T by 1 d , \u22121 ; G by 1, 1 d ; and C by 1 d , 1 , where d is a positive integer. The authors have shown that the degree of degeneracy of the new graphs is lower than for Nandy plots, but it is still present and depends on the value of d.",

We have called this representation 2D-dynamic graph because its numerical representation, i.e. the set of descriptors, is analogous to the one used in the dynamics (see subsequent chapter). This method is based on Nandy plots but it removes the degeneracy coming from the repetitive walks. The DNA sequence is represented as a set of material points in 2D space. Figure 4 , panel a, shows the method of plotting the 2D-dynamic graph for a model sequence CTC and Fig. 5 , panel a, for CTCT one. The first base in the sequence is C and we make a shift along the vertical axis in the positive direction. At the end of this vector (position (0,1)) we locate the point with the mass equal to 1. The second base in the sequence is T and we make the second shift along the vertical axis in the negative direction starting from the end of the last vector. At the end of the second vector again we locate the point with the mass also 1 (position (0,0)) and so on. If the ends of vectors meet several times at the same point then the mass of this point increases (it is equal to the sum of all masses located in this point). The total mass in the graph is equal to the total number of bases in the sequence (3 in Fig. 4 and 4 in Fig. 5 ). Different masses are represented by different symbols in the plots. Please note that both sequences CTC and CTCT are represented by the identical Nandy plots (Figs. 4, 5, panels b) since the last shift in Fig. 5 is made along the same trace as the previous one. 2D-dynamic graph removes this degeneracy (the masses of the points (0,0) are different: 1 for CTC and 2 for CTCT). The difference between the two sequences is also revealed in the mass-density distributions which we create for x and y directions [101] . The masses are projected onto two orthogonal directions and then summed for each x and y. In the model examples the results of the projection and of the summation of the masses are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 (panels a). For example, in the x direction, they are 3 and 4 in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. The mass-density distributions are composed of single lines located at the coordinates corresponding to the projected masses (x = 0 for \u03c1 x and y = 0, y = 1 for \u03c1 y ). The intensities of the lines correspond to the projected masses. The center panels in Figs. 4 and 5 correspond to mass-density distributions for x direction (\u03c1 x ) and the right ones for y directions (\u03c1 y ). These distributions create another way of visualization of the 2D-dynamic graphs. However, the main reason for the creation of the mass-density distributions is deriving new descriptors related to 2D-dynamic graphs (see the subsequent chapter).",

Within this model, differences in only one base can be detected. By using linear graphical representations of DNA sequences the problem of degeneracy can be overcome. However, in technical terms, the visualization of long sequences is rather inconvenient. A good solution for this drawback is introducing a resolution parameter for linear representations as it was done for the four-component spectral representations (for details see Sect. 4).",

Four nucleotides form 16 dinucleotides and 64 trinucleotides. By assigning different vectors to each pair or to each trinucleotide in 3D space, 3D-curves are obtained. The curves contain the information about neighboring bases and their distributions along the sequence. Dual nucleotides can be also divided into groups according to their chemical properties, as for example purine dinucleotides (AG, GA), pirymidyne dinucleotides (CT, TC), amino ones (AC, CA), keto ones (TG, GT), weak H-bond (AT, TA) and strong H-bond (CG, GC). 3D graphical representation of one sequence by four characteristic curves based on dinucletides has been proposed by Cao et al.

The mean x and y coordinate values are equal to the firstorder moments (M x,1 , M y,1 ) of the mass-density distribution, \u03c1 x and \u03c1 y respectively. In particular, if in a 2D-dynamic graph we put all masses equal to 1, then the 2Ddynamic graph becomes the Nandy plot and all the moments of the two graphs are identical. Introducing the masses different than 1, the mean x and y coordinate values become the coordinates of the center of mass of the graph and are different than for the Nandy plot. As the new descriptors we proposed moments of the mass-density distributions \u03c1 x and \u03c1 y up to the sixth order [101] and up to the eighth order [142] . Higher-order moments give more specific information about the distribution of masses. For example, second-order moments (M x,2 , M y,2 ) give the information about the width of \u03c1 x and \u03c1 y . We have shown that the third-(M x,3 ), fourth-(M x,4 ), fifth-(M x,5 ), and sixth-order (M x,6 ) x-moments of the mass-density distributions representing histone H4 coding sequences have different values for plants than for vertebrates [101] . In the present work, 2D-plots M x,q \u2212 M x,q are proposed instead of 1D-plots (descriptors versus labels of the sequences) that were shown in [101] . 2D-plots are shown in Fig. 6 6 . In all the plots we observe clusterization of evolutionary similar organisms: plants are located in different parts of the plots than the vertebrates.",

Figure 7 shows moment-based classification of the molecules: M 1 \u2212 M 2 (top), M 3 \u2212 M 4 (middle), and M 5 \u2212 M 6 (bottom). We have shown that the new molecular descriptors (moments of the intensity distributions) have different values for two kinds of molecules: nitriles and amides. In our recent paper, 1D plots have been presented (descriptors versus labels of the molecules) [143] . Figure 7 shows 2D plots. We observe that the descriptors representing nitriles are located in different parts of the plots than those representing amides. Figures 6 and 7 represent different objects: DNA sequences and molecules, respectively. However, the idea is the same. The clusterization of the descriptors indicates that these descriptors can be a good tool for similarity/dissimilarity analysis. The descriptors cluster (have similar values) for similar objects so they exhibit some properties of the considered objects. Moreover, some of the plots reveal similar shapes, as for example, middle and bottom parts of Fig. 7 . This may suggest correlations between some of the descriptors. However, the shape is similar but not identical. The problem of correlation and extracting the minimal set of moments we studied in ref. [144] . We concluded that a universal set of independent moments does not exist. Usually 4 lowest moments are sufficient to describe the object but also the information coming from higher-order moments cannot be neglected in some cases.",

We also introduced the principal moments of inertia as the descriptors of DNA sequences associated with the 2D-dynamic graph [100] . They are associated with the rotations about the principal axes. The moment of inertia of an object about a given axis describes how difficult is to induce an angular rotation of the object about this axis. If the mass is concentrated close to the axis of rotation, it is easier to accelerate into spinning fast and the moment of inertia is smaller. As a consequence, these descriptors give the information about the concentrations of masses around the axes. Another kind of new descriptors has been recently proposed by Huang et al. [98] . The authors proposed to take as the descriptors the set of characteristic vectors rep-resenting all bases in the sequence. Guo and Wang obtained smooth curves from the zigzag curves and took curvatures of the smooth curves as descriptors of the sequences [145] . Yu et al. proposed two kinds of descriptors: a set of coordinates of TN curves, and the probabilities of occurring of particular trinucleotides among all 64 trinucleotides in the sequence [134] .

The particular bases are represented by Gaussians centered at p = ( p \u2212 1)r , where p = 1, 2, . . . 50. The first base is represented by a Gaussian with the maximum located at 1 = 0 for all the cases and the last one at 50 = 49, 50 = 98, 50 = 147, 50 = 196 for r = 1, r = 2, r = 3, r = 4 respectively. For smaller r the bases are located close to each other and as a consequence the neighboring Gaussian functions overlap and we observe the envelope of the spectrum. In particular, if all the bases are the same, the spectrum becomes rectangular (Fig. 8, panel a) . Increasing the resolution, the range for which the spectrum is different than zero becomes larger and we have a chance to look into details of the spectra. The details are the locations of particular bases along the sequence. For long sequences, the balance between the details of spectra and the range of the plot determined by the location of the last Gaussian N = (N \u2212 1)r has to be found. Theoretically, the resolution may change from a small positive value to infinity. However changing the resolution not always results in a change of the information coming from the spectrum. For example, if in the model example the resolution is taken as smaller than 1 then also rectangular representation is obtained. Figure 9 shows I A spectrum for this model example where r = 0.5. The difference between r = 1 (Fig. 8, panel a) is the range ( 50 = 24.5 for r = 0.5) and the maximum values of I A . For smaller resolution the range of the spectrum is smaller and the neighboring maxima are located close to each other. As a consequence of closely located Gaussian functions exp[\u2212(x \u2212 p ) 2 ], the resulting maxima of spectrum I A are larger (around 3 in Fig. 9 and around 2 in Fig. 8, panel a) . However the qualitative information is the same in Fig. 8 , panel a, and in Fig. 9 .",

This means that the difference of the distributions of C bases along the sequences is the largest comparing to the differences of the distributions of other bases. Moreover comparing the number of lines that are positive to the ones that are negative, for a particular plot, one can easily estimate the differences between the numbers of the particular bases. For example, N C = 79 for the sequence of human and N C = 96 for the sequence of maize so the number of negative lines for I C i j is larger then the number of the positive ones. Analogously, the Table 16) number of negative lines for I G i j can be seen: N G = 100 for the sequence of human and N G = 111 for the sequence of maize. Since the number of A and T bases are larger for the sequence of human then for the sequence of maize, one can observe in I A i j and I T i j plots more positive lines than the negative ones. In Fig. 13 the differences with the resolution r = 1 between the spectra representing histone H4 coding sequence of human (i = 9, Table 17 ) and histone H4 coding sequence of mouse ( j = 7, Table 17 ) are shown. As a result of the difference between the numbers of A bases one can observe in I A i j more positive lines than the negative ones: N A = 73 for the sequence of human and N A = 65 for the sequence of mouse.

Generally, comparing Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 one can see that the differences human-maize spectra are larger then the differences human-mouse spectra (the number of lines in Fig. 12 is larger then the number of lines in Fig. 13 ). x Fig. 13 Differences between the spectra for histone H4 coding sequence of human M60749 and histone H4 coding sequence of mouse V00753 (i = 9, j = 7, Table 17) As the descriptors of the four-component spectral representation, I have proposed D \u03b3 q . Figure 14 shows D G 1 \u2212 D G 4 diagram for ten sequences listed in Table 17 and for one additional sequence (one point in the figure represents descriptors of one sequence). The additional sequence is histone H4 coding sequence of human (M16707). In many articles the ten sequences were treated as a model set to introduce new graphical and numerical representations. However, there was a mistake in the old version of the EMBL database. Obviously, the length of this coding sequence should be 312 and not 311 as it was in the old version of the EMBL database. The additional base is G, located at the last position of the sequence. The descriptors D \u03b3 q of spectral representation are very sensitive. The difference by only one base can be detected using these descriptors. Moreover, the approximate location of this base can be indicated. The descriptors characterizing the same sequence calculated using the old and new version of the EMBL database have been denoted using different symbols in Fig. 14 . Their locations are different in the diagram. It is remarkable that the difference by this very base may be recognized in the plots. Table 17 Figures 15, 16, 17, 18 show the diagrams also for the sequences listed in Table 17 . In particular, Fig. 15 shows diagrams for G-descriptors, Fig. 16 for Adescriptors, Fig. 17 for C-descriptors, and Fig. 18 for T-descriptors. Panels a in the figures correspond to D Table 17 indicates the location in the sequence of the base that is different for a pair of sequences. The additional G base in the new sequence causes the shift to larger values of the mean of the distribution (D G 1 becomes larger, Fig. 14, Fig. 15 , panel a). The width of the distribution also increases (D G 2 for the new sequence is larger than for the old one, Fig. 15 Table 17 lows:",

            "text": "Sim (5, 6) Sim ( 100 19 by j = 7, 8, 9) . However, using new similarity approach it is possible to extract such components of the similarity measures that cluster the sequence of chicken with the ones of vertebrates rather than with the ones of plants [147] . Table 18 shows similarity values obtained using different similarity measures \"Sim\". Using alignment method (Sim=CL) the similarity value \"chicken-plant\" CL(5,6) is the same as the similarity value \"chicken-vertebrate\" CL (5, 7) . Considering different aspects of similarity, using d \u03b3 3 , one can see that the clusterization of the sequence of chicken with vertebrates is obtained for \u03b3 = G, A, C. However the asymmetry of the gene structure for T bases is identical for the sequence of chicken and of plants (d T 3 (5, 6) = 100) and the similarity value is small in case \"chicken-vertebrate\" (d T 3 (5, 7) = 19). Figures 19 and 20 show the diagrams for the sequences listed in Table 16 (histone H1 coding sequences of different species). In particular, Fig. 19 shows D and D \u03b3 2 is linear. The most regular linear dependence is for G-descriptors (Fig. 20,  panel d) . However, using the diagrams for the descriptors independent of the lengths of sequences (Fig. 19) , for A and G-descriptors (panels a, d respectively) the clusterization of plants and vertebrates is observed. For C-descriptors, the effect of clusterization is smaller. The effect of clusterization is not observed for T-descriptors. T-descriptors representing sequences of plants and vertebrates even overlap. These observations are the same as in the case of histone H4 coding sequences. Figures 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 show the relations between the standard calculations Clustal W (C L) and the new measures (Eqs. 24, 25, 27) for the sequences listed in Table 17 (histone H4 coding sequences). Table 16 Figures 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 are plotted in the same way as it has been done in chapter 2 (Figs. 1, 2, 3) . Each point in the plot corresponds to one case: comparison of sequence of species No. i with sequence of species No. j using different methods. For example, the horizontal axis in Fig. 21 corresponds to the similarity matrix between sequences of different species using Clustal W method (C L) and the vertical axes correspond to the similarity matrix between the same sequences using different components of alternative similarity measures d \u03b3 q . As a consequence each plot represents two similarity matrices, which gives a better visualization of the relations between two different similarity measures. In the figures, the functions x = y, where x and y represent, respectively, the horizontal and vertical axes, are plotted Table 16 (dashed lines). Comparing the distributions of the points around the dashed lines it is easy to recognize these aspects of similarity for which the relations are the same. If the points are concentrated close to the lines then the similarity relations represented by x and y axes are also close to each other. The similarity matrix C L based on Clustal W approach for the considered sequences is given in [146] . Small range of similarity measures indicates small differences Table 17 between the sequences of different species. The range of values of C L is from 78% to 100%. The ranges of values of d \u03b3 q for q = 1, q = 2, and q = 4 are smaller than for q = 3 for all \u03b3 . d \u03b3 3 changes from about 15% to 100% for all \u03b3 . The differences between sequences across species using d \u03b3 4 are smaller than using d Since each \u03b3 -component is related in a different way to the standard measure, one may expect that it carries independent similarity information. Averaging the measures over \u03b3 , and then averaging over q, d M E AN q (Eq. 25) and d n (i, j) (Eq. 27) are obtained. Figure 25 shows the relations of d n with the standard measure. The convergence of d n measures to the standard measure CL we have discussed in [147] . In the present paper this effect is shown in detail adding d 1 Table 17 term. d 1 is very different from CL (the points are located far away from the dashed line, panel a, Fig. 25 ). Adding higher-order terms, the points are pushed towards the dashed lines (panels b, c, d Fig. 25 ). Figures 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 show similarity relations for \u03b2-globin gene across species using similarity measures defined in Eqs. 32 and 33. These data are the standard ones for alternative methods. Since the sequences in the database are not complete for some species, they are unified in this work and the appropriate locations in the gene are listed in the tables. In particular, the sequences of mouse and of chicken belong to the standard set of data used by many authors. However, several bases are ambiguous for the third exons for the sequences of the two species. As it was already mentioned, the method used in this work is so sensitive that even a difference in a single base can influence the results. Therefore the sequences of mouse and of chicken are omitted from this consideration. Moreover, in gorilla and chimpanzee sequences the stop codons are not available in the database. Therefore for all the species the stop codons are excluded from the calculations. This means that the length of the coding sequence N CDS is three times larger than the corresponding length of the protein sequence for all the species. In this way (excluding the stop codons) all the data used in the calculations are consistent. Table 17 The locations in the gene, the numbers of \u03b3 bases, N \u03b3 k , for each k-th exon according to the latest version of the EMBL database are specified in Tables 19, 20 Table 17. 5. The whole first exons which are given in the EMBL database only for three species with the length N W 1 , denoted Exon 1, 6. The coding sequences with the lengths N CDS = 3 k=1 N k , denoted CDS. \u03b3 are also shown in Fig. 28 . In this figure the measures are compared for different parts of the \u03b2-globin gene. The horizontal axes correspond to the sequences with introns, PlusI. The vertical axes correspond to the coding sequences of particular exons: column 1 to Exon 1 C DS , column 2 to Exon 2 C DS and column 3 to Exon 3 C DS . The first row of subfigures correspond to A bases, the second row to C bases, the third row to T bases and the fourth row to G bases.",

By a common property we understand close to zero S 3,4 \u03b3 (small values correspond to large similarities). In particular small differences between sequences across species are revealed for G bases for the first and for the second exons (panels j, k) and also for C and for T bases for the second exon (panels e, h). Generally, larger differences are seen for longer sequences. However also for PlusI one can extract properties more common for the species (small ranges of S 3,4 A [PlusI] and S 3,4 T [PlusI]-first and third rows). Figure 29 shows similarity relations for different exons using standard alignment method Clustal W version 2.0 [148] . As it was mentioned before, the alignment methods do not take into account which bases are aligned. The alignment of all the bases gives the contribution to the final result and, as a consequence, the similarity is large for all the parts. It is not possible to extract detailed properties of similarities. The information coming from these calculations is averaged. Finally, the similarity Table 23 values for different exons are the same for all the species since most of the points are concentrated close to the dashed lines. Complete sequences for the first exons are given only for three species (Table 23 ). The whole sequences of the first exons for human and gorilla differ by only one base. As we see in Fig. 30 this is G base. The descriptors D A 1 , D C 1 , D T 1 are exactly the same for human and gorilla sequences. The difference caused by this single base is recognized by D G 1 (panel d). ",

Since many authors use slightly different data for \u03b2-globin gene, the locations of different subsequences in this gene and their full description listed in the tables may be helpful for some alternative similarity studies. The numbers of particular bases in all the sequences are also given. It has been shown that the four-component spectral representation can be used for the classification studies (clusterization of the descriptors representing histones H4 and H1 coding sequences of plants and of vertebrates). Analogous clusterization is also obtained using some descriptors related to 2D-dynamic graphs (Sect. 4). The sensitivity of the four-component spectral representation has also been shown. In particular, a difference between a pair of sequences by only one base can be recognized. Also the approximate location of the difference and the base which is different in the compared sequences can be also determined.",

This means that the results obtained with the alignment method may be interpreted as an average of the considered components of the alternative similarity measures. Calculating an average is always related to some loss of information, i.e. large degree of degeneracy may appear. As we know, this is an inconvenient feature of similarity/dissimilarity analysis. For example, using the alignment methods the two situations 1. AAAA AAAA 2. TTTT TTTT cannot be distinguished. Therefore, using the four-component spectral representations one has a chance to decompose the similarity information and remove the degeneracy.",

It has been shown that each part of \u03b2-globin gene demonstrates different similarity relations across species. The relations also change when different aspects of similarity are compared (asymmetry of the gene structure or kurtosis of the distributions). Therefore using different descriptors or different graphical representations the results may be or very often should be contradictory. Different alternative methods describe different aspects of similarity. In particular, most of alternative studies that have been performed for Exon 1 CDS of \u03b2-globin gene often give contradictory results. For example the similarity value of Exon 1 CDS human-goat is larger than human-mouse if the methods described in the works [106, 112, 126, 137, 149] are used. The reverse situation i.e. similarity value between the sequences of Exon 1 CDS human-goat is smaller than human-mouse if methods taken from [32, 33, 36, 108, 110, 122, [150] [151] [152] are applied.",

We expect the largest similarity for human-chimpanzee sequences. However detailed similarity/dissimilarity analysis of beta-globin gene using four-component spectral representation indicates that this is not true for all parts of the beta-globin gene and for all \u03b3 -components of similarity measures. According to the definition of the new measures, S 3,4 \u03b3 becomes smaller if the sequences are more similar. Considering the second exon, I obtain the largest similarity in the case of human-chimpanzee sequences. This means that S 3,4 \u03b3 is the smallest for the two sequences for all \u03b3 , and in particular S 3,4 \u03b3 =0 for \u03b3 = A, C, T . The difference between the two sequences is only in the distribution of G bases. It is interesting to note that S 3,4 \u03b3 = 0 for the second exon, both for C and for T bases, in three cases: human-chimpanzee, human-gorilla and gorilla-chimpanzee sequences. However for other exons, S 3,4 \u03b3 is not always the smallest in the case of human-chimpanzee sequences comparing to human-other species sequences. If the sequence with introns, PlusI, is considered then S 3,4 C is the smallest for humanchimpanzee sequences and for \u03b3 = A, T, G, S 3, 4 \u03b3 are the smallest for human-gorilla sequences.",
