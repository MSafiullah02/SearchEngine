Plants and animals of marine and terrestrial origins are considered to be main food resources for humans, of which the marine environment is considered to be one of the best and huge reservoirs. It has been repeatedly reported that marine sources consist of animals and plants, which can be potentially used as foods in our daily life (Kim, 2012; Kim and Taylor, 2011). Macroalgae is one of the class of marine plants that has gained much attention in the recent years for health food supplements used as food ingredients and animal feeds in East Asia. These macroalgae are rich sources of soluble dietary fibers, proteins, peptides, carotenoids, polysaccharides, minerals, and potential metabolites (Yang et al., 2016; S\u00e1nchez-Camargo et al., 2016). It has also been suggested elsewhere that metabolites derived from macroalgae have potential biological activities such as antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic, anti-HIV, and anti-cancer activities (Yang et al., 2016). Owing to ample of these medicinal properties, the marine macroalgae can be considered as a potential health benefitting medicinal food.",

            "text": "\u201cPhlorotannin\u201d (1,3,5-trihydroxy benzene), is a group of polyphenolic compounds which are commonly present in the brown algae accounting for about 5\u201312% of the dry mass (Sathya et al., 2017). The development of phlorotannin can occur through polymerization of phloroglucinol oligomers via acetate-malonate (polyketide) pathway (Li et al., 2011a; Sathya et al., 2017). . Eisenia bicyclis, Ecklonia cava and Ecklonia kurome are commonly found in Japanese and Korean coastal areas. Phlorotannin content in Eisenia bicycles accounts for 3% of total dry mass of algae. HPLC results suggest that E\n.\nbicycles consists of phloroglucinol (0.9%), phloroglucinol tetramer (4.4%), eckol (7.5%), phlorofucofuroeckol A (21.9%), dieckol (23.4%), and 8,8\u2032-bieckol (24.6%), plus some 17.3% of other unknown phenolic compounds (Shibata et al., 2004). However, phlorotannin content in seaweeds can also vary through the individual species, geographic region and extraction techniques (J\u00e9gou et al., 2015). Fucodiphlorethol G was isolated from E\n.\ncava for the first time and acetylated to make different derivatives of the compound (Young et al., 2007).",

Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is widely used to characterize the structure of compounds.

            "text": "HPLC-HRMS (high resolution mass spectrometer) is the most commonly used method to characterize phlorotannins (Melanson and Mackinnon, 2015). Folin\u2013Ciocalteu assay is a commonly used technique to quantify the phlorotannin content in a given species. Recently, 1H qNMR was also used to quantify the phlorotannin content in brown algae (J\u00e9gou et al., 2015; Parys et al., 2007). Furthermore, Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) has also been employed to study the isomeric complexity between the phlorotannins (Heffernan et al., 2015). Water-Organic solvent mixtures were also used to extract the phlortannins. The details of step by step extraction procedure and purification were given by Gall et al. (2015). Balboa et al. (2015) developed a biorefinery process for the isolation of phlortanin in a single method. In this method, conventional solvent extraction with 96% ethanol, supercritical CO2 extraction method, and membrance microfiltration were used. Tierney et al. (2013, 2014) developed pressurized a liquid extraction method, which was used to extract the polyphenol compounds from Irish macrolage Ascophyllum nodosum, Pelvetia canaliculata, Fucus spiralis and Ulva intestinalis and compared with the traditional solid\u2013liquid extraction techniques in terms of their antioxidant properties. The results suggest that pressurized liquid extraction produces higher phenolic compounds when compared to traditional extraction methods (Tierney et al., 2013, 2014). Two-dimensional liquid chromatography was used to isolate phlorotannin from seaweed (Montero et al., 2014). Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) was used to separate the phlorotannins, which were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction using the solvent system n-hexane:EtOAc:methanol:water (2:7:3:7, v/v). Dieckol (fraction I, 40.2 mg), phlorofucofuroeckol-A (fraction III, 31.1 mg), and fraction II (34.1 mg) with 2,7-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol and pyrogallol-phloroglucinol-6,6-bieckol were isolated from the crude extract (500 mg) by a one-step CPC system (Lee et al., 2014). In another study, a macroporous adsorption resin was used for chromatographic purification of seaweed phlorotannins (Figs. 2 and 3\n). Four different resins (HP-20, SP-850, XAD-7HP, and XAD-2) were tested, and HP-20 resin showed the highest adsorption and desorption capacities (Kim et al., 2014). Compared to organic solvent extract, the recovery yield of dieckol from the boiling water of E\n.\ncava, Ecklonia stolonifera, Ecklonia bicyclis was found to be 86%, 93%, and 98%, respectively (Chowdhury et al., 2014).",

The yields of the phlorotannins increased 2\u20134 times in summer (June\u2013October) and then were decreased to normal levels in winter (November\u2013March). In the extraction of E. bicyclis, ethanol percentage in water, extraction time and washing time significantly affected the yield of the extract and the phlorotannins, whereas the temperature and the sample/solvent ratio impacted the extraction to a lesser degree (Kim et al., 2013b).",

Biosynthesis of phlorotannins has also been explored (Bertoni, 2013). The UHPLC-HRMS method described was successful in rapid profiling of phlorotannins in brown seaweeds based on their degree of polymerisation. HILIC (Hydrophilic interaction chromatography) was demonstrated to be an effective separation mode, particularly for low molecular weight phlorotannins (Steevensz et al., 2012). Mature thalli contained 1.5-fold more dieckol (1.82 mg/g-dry tissue) than young thalli. In the tissues of E\n.\ncava, blade tissue contained more phlorotannins than the stipe or holdfast. Among differently dried thalli, approximately 90% or more dieckol and phlorofucofuroeckol-A were extracted from shadow-dried tissue as compared with lyophilized tissue (Chowdhury et al., 2011). The 2,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMBA) assay was developed whereby the chemical specifically reacts with phlorotannins to form a coloured product (Stern et al., 1996). Phlorotannins from different regions and species of North American and Australasian marine herbivores vary significantly in terms of structure and function (Van Altena and Steinberg, 1992). Important and chemically characterised phlorotannins with HPLC and NMR techniques are shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3.",

In addition to this, phlorotannins can act as total antioxidant with high reducing power activity. DPPH free radical scavenging of Sargassum aquifolium species were the highest, corresponding to 6.770 \u00b1 0.001 mg phlorotannin g\u22121 dry weight (DW), 6.1290 \u00b1 0.0200 mg ascorbic acid g\u22121 DW, 19.7210 \u00b1 0.0300 mg FeSO4 g\u22121 DW and 76.28 \u00b1 0.20% of 25 \u03bcg DPPH mL\u22121 extract (Cuong et al., 2016).

The general method to check the antioxidant activity of compound were as follows with the small modifications (Yotsu-Yamashita et al., 2013). First, 5 \u03bcL of sample solution were mixed with 95 \u03bcL of 1:1 volume of 0.4 M ethanolic solution of DPPH and 100 mM aqueous MES (sodium 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonate) buffer (pH 6.0) for 1 min.

            "text": "Chronic inflammation is one of the main reasons behind majority of diseases. Several kind of anti-inflammatory drugs are available in the market to treat the inflammatory diseases, but those drugs are often associated with some side effects. Therefore, much attention has been paid to natural marine-based anti-inflammatory compounds (Cheung et al., 2016; Balboa et al., 2012; Shin et al., 2006). Marine-based compounds are unique and have proven to be potentially useful to treat inflammatory diseases. Yang et al. (2016) proposed that the phlorotannin-rich E\n.\ncava can be used to treat sepsis. Eom et al. (2017) investigated anti-inflammatory effects of eckol on Propionibacterium acnes induced human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells. The functions of eckol in production of nitric oxide, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9, NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and necrosis factor-\u03b1 were also studied. Eckol significantly inhibited the expression or formation of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines in HaCaT cells (Eom et al., 2017). In most of the studies, LPS (lipopolysaccharide) was used to induce the inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. Kang et al. (2015) reported that diphlorethohydroxycarmalol reduced interleukin 6 (IL-6), DPHC (12.5 and 100 \u03bcM) and suppressed the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappa (NF \u03baB). In another study, Wijesinghe et al. (2013) reported that phlorotannin-rich fermented E\n.\ncava by-product extract dose-dependently inhibited nitric oxide production, prostaglandin-E2 production and suppressed inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expressions in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Sugiura et al. (2013) reported the inhibitory effect of histamine release from rat basophile leukaemia (RBL) 2H3 cells. The anti-inflammatory activity potential of the methanolic extract and its fractions from Eisenia bicyclis was in the order of dichloromethane > methanol > ethyl acetate > n-butanol (Jung et al., 2013). 6,6\u2032-Bieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol A also suppressed LPS-induced iNOS, COX2 and PEG2 production and inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages (Yang et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2009, 2011a).",

The results showed that dieckol rich extract group decreased in insulin and C-peptide levels in 12 weeks, however there is no significant difference between the groups (Lee and Jeon, 2015). Antidiabetic effect of phlorotannins can follow diverse mechanisms, such as to improve insulin resistance or inhibition of hepatic glucose by stimulating GK (Hepatic glucokinase) activity (Lee and Jeon, 2013). Dieckol isolated from brown seaweed significantly attenuated type II diabetes which was investigated in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mouse model. Dieckol was administered through intraperitoneal route at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose for 14 days. The results show that reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as increased activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, catalase (CAT) and GSH-px in liver tissues were observed in the dieckol administered group (Kang et al., 2013d). Even though the phlorotannins from E\n.\nkurome showed some amount of toxicity, their consumption might be useful in ameliorating diabetics-related complications (Xu et al., 2012).",

The Ascophyllum extracts inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase, another key enzyme involved in starch digestion and blood glucose regulation, at low levels, e.g. IC50 of approximatively 20 \u03bcg/mL GAE (Nwosu et al., 2011). It is evidenced that diphlorethohydroxycarmalol (DPHC) has the ability to reduce the effects of \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase. The IC50 values of DPHC against \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase were 0.16 and 0.53 mM, respectively. In addition to this, increased postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly suppressed in the DPHC-administered group than those in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic or normal mice. Moreover, the area under curve (AUC) was significantly reduced via DPHC administration (2022 versus 2210 mmol min/L) in the diabetic mice as well as it delayed the absorption of dietary carbohydrates (Toume et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2012). High glucose (30 mM) treatment induced the death of rat insulinoma cells, but treatment with 10 or 50 \u03bcg/mL 6,6\u2032-bieckol significantly inhibited the high glucose-induced glucotoxicity. In addition to this, usage of 6,6\u2032-bieckol significantly reduced the level of TBARS, generation of intracellular ROS and NO level, all of which were increased at high glucose concentrations (Park et al., 2015).",

This may be caused because of the extensive formation of reactive species. Several small molecules have been used to suppress the reactive oxygen species to prevent further damages (Shin et al., 2014). Some of the compounds from marine resources have also been used such as dieckol and dioxinodehydroeckol (DHE) from E\n.\ncava. Chang et al. (2016) investigated drug-induced ototoxicity with dieckol in mice model; mice pre-treated with gentamicin were later exposed to dieckol for 48 h. Partial protection of gentamycin induced hair loss was observed after the treatment of dieckol (Chang et al., 2016). DHE has been explored for protective effect against UVB-induced damages in HaCaT cells. The cells were exposed to 20 mJ cm\u22122 of UVB irradiation which is the minimal erythema dose (MED) for individuals to be able to tan. Furthermore, the expression levels of Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3, -8, -9, which are the genes associated with apoptosis were investigated when cells were either treated with DHE doses after UVB irradiation or exposed to UVB only. Clear UVB-protective effects were observed in DHE-treated cells (Ryu et al., 2015). In another study, DPHC was used to protect from UVB-induced DNA damages in HaCaT cells (Piao et al., 2015).",

Phloroglucinol, eckol and dieckol were used, and dieckol showed highest protective effect against ethanol-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the dieckol-treated group scavenged intracellular ROS and prevented lipid peroxidation and ethanol-induced cell death in the zebrafish embryo (Kang et al., 2013c). From the same group, reports suggest that most of the phlorotannins possess noticeable free radical scavenging activity, which can be potentially useful in diseases concerned with oxidative stress (Kang et al., 2013b). Eckstolonol from E\n.\ncava showed the protective effective against UVB-induced ROS in human keratinocytes (HaCaTs). Cell viability was decreased by UVB radiation and restored by the treatment with different eckstolonol concentrations (0, 5, 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcM). Furthermore, eckstolonol reduced UVB-induced ROS, lipid peroxidation, damaged DNA levels, and cell death (Jang et al., 2012). In another study, Heo et al.

Increase in the number of mature adipocytes is the main cause of obesity (Kim et al., 2013a). Some of the phlorotannins have shown inhibitory activity towards adipogenesis and obesity. Kang et al. (2015) investigated the phlorotannin from E\n.\ncava for inhibitory effect of adipogenesis. The researchers also examined the adipogenic activities by measuring glycerol release level and adipogenic-related gene expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The phlorotannin increased glycerol secretion and reduced glucose consumption level in cells. In addition, effects on PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1 and differentiation-dependent factor 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, as well as downstream genes such as fatty acid binding protein-4, fatty acid transport protein-1, fatty acid synthase, leptin and acyl-CoA synthetase 1 were also studied (Kong et al., 2015). In another study by Karadeniz et al. (2015), it was reported that phlorotannin suppressed adipogenesis in preadipocytes. Triphlorethol-A, eckol and dieckol were checked against the antiadipogenesis activity. Phlorotannin (20 \u03bcM) reduced lipid accumulation and suppressed the adipogenic differentiation markers (Karadeniz et al., 2015). In another study, dieckol from E\n.\ncava suppressed lipid accumulation in animal model. Mice were used in the study with normal diet, high-fat diet and dieckol-treated groups. Dieckol-supplemented groups showed significant decreases in body weight gain (36%) when compared with the high-fat diet group. In addition, dieckol downregulated the adipogenic factors and decreased the triacylglycerol content in MT3-L1 cells (Choi et al., 2015).",
