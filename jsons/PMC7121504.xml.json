            "text": "During an epidemic outbreak, individuals may change their behavior in order to reduce the risk of infection, especially when serious consequences for individual health are implied. A population-based survey reported that more than 75 % of respondents would avoid public transportation and 20\u201330 % would try to avoid crowded environments as precautionary actions in response to a hypothetical influenza pandemic  [22]. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza, an initial high level of anxiety about the pandemic has been observed [11] and different behavioral changes triggered by the perceived risk of infection have been reported [7, 21, 23\u201325]. In Australia, after the first pandemic wave, individuals \u201creported increasing handwashing (46 %) and covering cough and sneezes (27 %)\u201d to reduce the risk of infection  [24]. In the USA, data collected on public response to H1N1 influenza from May 2009 to June 2009 suggest that \u201c16 to 25 % of Americans had avoided places where many people are gathered, like sporting events, malls, or public transportation and 20 % had reduced contact with people outside [their] household as much as possible\u201d  [25]. Furthermore, larger uncoordinated behavioral changes have been detected for more severe epidemics. For instance, an 80 % reduction in travel to and from Hong Kong has been reported during the 2003 SARS crisis  [9]. This empirical evidence highlights that behavioral response occurs when a new infectious disease emerges, although it is hard to quantify its impact on the epidemic spread.",

In this case, the \u201crecovery from fear\u201d occurs at a constant rate, regardless the current state of the epidemic and the behavior adopted by the individuals. However, individuals may or may not reduce risky behaviors on the basis of the current risk perception of the epidemic. The approach considered in this chapter is based on evolutionary game theory  [12], which allows considering a symmetric mechanism regulating spontaneous behavioral changes. Different behaviors adopted in the population are represented by a given set of strategies. The adoption of self-protection is assumed to be driven by the perceived convenience of different behaviors, dependent on the epidemic dynamics.",

On the other hand, \u03c1 drives the delay (embedded in the imitation dynamics) between the time at which a strategy becomes more convenient and the time at which the strategy is adopted by the majority of the population. In sum, the time at which the transition between the two possible behaviors occurs is driven by m, while the duration of this transition is driven by \u03c1; these two parameters together define the responsiveness of the population to an epidemic outbreak.",

Indeed, the estimated parameter configuration obtained by fitting ILI incidence entails an initial overestimation of the perceived risk (which decreases over time), along with an initial diffusion of the altered behavior in the population, which in turn is replaced by the normal behavior during the course of the epidemic. In fact, at the beginning of the pandemic, the simulated population is led to adopt the altered behavior by a high level of perceived risk of infection (as in the presence of a well-sustained circulation of the virus) and, as a consequence, the growth rate of the epidemic results lower than what would have been observed in a population adopting the normal behavior. On the other hand, a decrease in the perceived risk of infection is observed, despite the (slow) increase in the actual number of cases. In fact, the latter depends on the combination of two opposite phenomena: the increase of new infections and the decline (slowed by the memory mechanism) of the perceived prevalence, which was overestimated in the early phases of the epidemic. As the perceived prevalence goes below the risk threshold 1 \u2215 m, the normal behavior starts to spread quickly in the population as the most convenient strategy to be adopted through the subsequent course of the epidemic. This leads to a sudden change in the growth rate of the epidemic which is triggered by an increase of R\n0. Model simulations show that the two distinct exponential growth phases observed for ILI incidence correspond to an initial diffusion of the altered behavior in the population, which determines an epidemic spread driven by R\n0\na, and a second phase characterized by the diffusion of the normal behavior, where the spread is driven R\n0\nn. The best estimate for R\n0\na is 1.24 and for R\n0\nn is 1.48. Estimates of R\n0\nn, i.e. the basic reproductive number for a population in which the normal behavior is widely adopted, are in good agreement with those obtained for the 2009 influenza pandemic [2, 3, 10, 16].",

In particular, if changes in behavioral patterns are fast enough, they can have a remarkable effect in reducing the daily prevalence of infection and the final epidemic size. In addition, human response may also lead to quite rich epidemic dynamics including, for example, the occurrence of multiple epidemic waves. Our performed investigation singles out the main determinants of human behavior and risk perception leading to remarkable alterations of the dynamics of an epidemic outbreak. First, if the perceived risk associated to an epidemic is sufficiently large, even a small decrease in the number of potentially infectious contacts can remarkably reduce the impact of an epidemic. Second, the disease spread is highly sensitive to how rapidly people adopt self-protecting behavioral patterns. Third, when the population becomes aware only late of a new epidemic outbreak, the effectiveness of human response reduces. However, when the mechanism regulating the spread of information about the disease is sufficiently fast, spontaneous social distancing is always effective.",
