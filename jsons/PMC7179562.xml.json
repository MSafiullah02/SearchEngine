This disease spread to Hong Kong first, and caused an outbreak in many countries including Vietnam, Canada, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries. Almost 9,000 individuals have been infected and over 900 have died from the disease since February 2003 [1]. This new and deadly syndrome was first brought to the attention of the World Health Organization (WHO) by Dr. Carlo Urbani, and was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2]. The pathogenesis of SARS is believed to be a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which was first found by Peiris et al. [3] in Hong Kong and was confirmed by other groups [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The analysis of genomic sequences showed that the virus is different from previously known coronaviruses [9, 10, 11], and serological studies also confirmed that the virus has not been found in humans [12].",

The previously known human coronaviruses are frequent causes of the common cold. Life-threatening pneumonia caused by coronaviruses is uncommon. Generally speaking, the genome of coronavirus is the largest (about 30 kb in length) found in any RNA viruses, which encodes 23 putative proteins, including 4 major structure proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. The N, S and M mature proteins contribute to generating the host immune response [13, 14]. Similarly, the genome of SARS-CoV is a 29729-nucleotide with polyadenylated RNA and about 41% GC content. The genomic organization of SARS-CoV is similar to that of a typical coronavirus, containing the characteristic gene order (5\u2032-replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid-3\u2032) and short untranslated regions at both termini [9, 10, 11].",

It is very important to understand the mutation rate of the SARS virus spreading through the population for the development of effective vaccines. Meanwhile, several studies have shown that adaptation of a virus to non-natural host cells induces genetic changes in viral genome, and these culture-mediated mutations may produce bias and affect evolutionary studies [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In order to avoid these causations, we sequenced the entire SARS-CoV directly using clinical specimens. Using these approaches, we were able to analyze the origin of SARS-CoV infection more accurately.",

It has been reported that some pathogenic microbes undergo adaptation in response to laboratory culturation. Host-mediated mutations in several viruses have been documented, such as HIV, Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A, Sendai and influenza A viruses [17, 18, 19, 20]. Molecular evolution studies using such sequences may be at risk of the data containing laboratory factors [16]; the analytic data that do not represent random samples of natural pathogen populations or the sampling design is unknown. In this study, we can directly detect the whole genome of SARS-CoV from clinical samples, so that it will avoid the bias mentioned above. Although TC1 (a clinical specimen) and TWC (an isolate) were from the same patient, phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were located at different positions of the phylogenetic tree. Our results confirmed that the sequences of a cultural isolate may be different from those of a clinical specimen although they are derived from the same origin. We analyzed the sequences of the variant observed in cultural isolates and clinical specimens which were published in GenBank. Interestingly, we found that the nt 3,852 C, 11,493 T and 26,477 G appeared in all the clinical specimens, but only in two of 23 cultural isolates. The nt 3,852 T, 11,493 C and 26,477 T were found in all the cultural isolates except TWC2 and in none of clinical specimens (table 5). From these discrepancies, these mutations may be most likely due to cultural adaptation, but we are unable to completely exclude the possibility of the shifting of two original different viruses during culturing process.",

In order to increase the specificity, a nested PCR [22] or a probe [25], enzyme hybridization methods [26], or microarray [27] have been used. In this study, we used multiplex RT-PCR to amplify the whole SARS genome in two separate reactions, and the PCR products were further amplified using 15 pairs of nested primers so that the products covered the whole genome in 15 separate tubes. The 15 PCR products were then sequenced. A similar approach has been used to analyze the HN gene of human parainfluenza virus [28], however, only a small portion of human parainfluenza genomes was analyzed. In contrast to this report, we analyze the whole genome of the biggest RNA virus. Although multiple RT-PCR to amplify the whole SARS genome can be used as a detection method, it is difficult to evaluate the quantitative change in the clinical specimens. So, we first amplified the Pol region of SARS virus to detect the virus and evaluate the quantitative changes of SARS virus, and then used multiplex RT-PCR and direct sequencing to analyze the whole genome.",
