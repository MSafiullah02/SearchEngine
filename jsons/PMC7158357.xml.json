Pigs designated SPF are a good source for biomedical research; however, it must be remembered that the designation does not mean that the animals are completely free of diseases that may interfere with research. It is best to buy animals from a herd in which the institutional veterinarian has screened for complicating diseases.

Swine reach sexual maturity and a commercial slaughter weight of approximately 250\u2013280 kg at 5\u20136 months of age. At birth, swine weigh approximately 3 kg (average); consequently, there is an exponential growth phase during the adolescent period. Most swine used in research programs are 15\u201330 kg and are 8\u201312 weeks of age. Weight gain during this period may be 2\u20135 kg per week. When selecting a model, the age and maturity factors must also be considered. Consequently, domestic swine are rarely used for long-term projects unless the study includes the effect of growth and maturity factors or the animals are involved in agricultural research. Generally, most projects involving a length of > 3 weeks would best be performed in miniature swine (Swindle, 1998; Swindle et al., 1994; Fisher, 1993).",

Commercial sources typically implement a vaccination and parasite-control program beginning at weaning age and dependent on the intended experimental use of the animal, such efforts may or may not need additional attention at the research facility.

Newly received animals should be given a minimum of 72 hr to adjust to the new environment during which time physical exams and screening tests for parasites can be performed. Diet changes should be gradual over several days, with fiber increased if stress-induced diarrhea develops. Adult swine that are housed long-term should have, at a minimum, periodic physical exams that include weight and parasite checks. Vaccination programs for adult swine should be implemented based on risk assessment that considers how the animal will be used in research, what the housing conditions are, and how close the research herd is to new animals of uncertain health status. Ideally, pigs should be purchased from one source of established health status to take advantage of natural herd immunity. The value of good herd health management is illustrated by the observation that swine herds that maintain specific pathogen-free status have an odds ratio of 0.2 relative to that of conventional herds for the development of diarrhea (Moller et al., 1998).",

Swine have difficulty with firm footing on these floors, especially when the floors are wet. If contact flooring is used, it should either have a rough surface to provide traction and provide wear on the hooves or it should be covered with deep wood-chip bedding. Wood-chip bedding keeps swine clean and satisfies their rooting instinct. However, wood-chip bedding is eaten by swine, especially when they are fasted. Raised flooring has been found to be satisfactory in many laboratory situations. Plastic-coated metal grids are sturdy and easy to sanitize. However, if a cut becomes apparent in the plastic, swine will strip the flooring and eat the plastic. Slatted fiberglass floors with grit to provide hoof wear are generally ideal in most situations. They are lightweight and easy to remove from pens for sanitation (Swindle, 1998).",

There is considerable variation of the genetic capacity for accretion of lean body mass among the various breeds of swine utilized in biomedical research. The \u201cfarm swine\u201d include breeds developed for meat production and at 6 months of age may have a lean body weight 5- to 6-fold greater than that of a micropig breed. The published research on swine nutrition is focused on farm swine and maximization of lean growth (Table III\n). The majority of mini- and microswine nutritional research is proprietary and is reflected in the commercially available formulations offered by feed companies. In general, the nutrient requirements of these breeds are similar; however, the small breeds often require fixed-quantity feeding to control obesity, especially for long-term research studies. This in turn necessitates a higher margin of safety for many nutrient concentrations to prevent deficiencies, since most commercially available diets are designed for free-choice feeding. Diets formulated for the mini- and microbreeds generally have lower-energy and higher-fiber concentrations. The daily energy (Fig. 10\n) and quantity of feed (Fig. 11\n) required by farm pigs will predispose the mini- and microbreeds to obesity.",

Neonates will compete for, and establish, teat order on their day of birth. This hierarchy remains until weaning (Sawatsky, 1993).

Many pigs respond to gentle rubbing of the ventral abdomen by rolling over onto their sides, enabling caregivers to perform such minor procedures as wound cleansing or suture removal without restraining the animals. This type of handling is very effective for positively reinforcing contact between pigs and their caretakers and has a calming effect on most animals.",

            "text": "In comparison to those of most other mammals, cortical and medullary areas of lymph nodes have an inverted relationship, a trait shared with the elephant, rhino, dolphin, hippo, and warthog (Pescovitz, 1998). Afferent lymph percolates from the central cortex to the outer paracortex (equivalent of medulla), where cells migrate through high endothelial venules and back into the blood; thus, efferent lymph is relatively acellular. Medullary areas of the porcine lymph node are denser in cell numbers than those of most other species, being rich in macrophages, plasma cells, and eosinophils. The pig also has prominent intraluminal macrophages within respiratory airways. Similar to ruminants, pigs have two types of Peyer's patches present in the small bowel. Although there is no clearly established functional distinction, the multiple (20 \u00b1) discrete Peyer's patches found in the jejunum contain B and T cells, while the singular long ileal Peyer's patch contains B cells almost exclusively (Barman et al., 1997). Due to a relative lack of specific antibodies, identification of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers to phenotype lymphocyte subsets has lagged such studies of the mouse and the human. Two International Swine Cluster of Differentiation Workshops have been held for comparison of novel antibodies to swine CD antigens and cross-reactive antibodies available from mouse and human studies (Saalmuller et al., 1998). Many homologous CD markers have now been identified, and a limited number are available commercially from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia) and Pharmingen, Inc. (San Diego, California). A monoclonal antiporcine CD3 antibody has been identified that is capable of activating or depleting T cells in vitro and inducing an immunosuppressive state in vivo, which will greatly facilitate studies of the swine immune system, in particular, induction of tolerance in xenotransplantation research (Huang et al., 1999). Bone marrow of swine is more similar to that of humans than of rodents in toxicity response to lethal irradiation, allowing studies that have demonstrated the benefit of T-cell depletion of donor tissues in preventing graft-versus-host disease.",

Reports on swine cytokine regulation and function suggest that the biology is similar to that of humans and mice and that there is some limited homology; swine lymphocytes will respond to recombinant human interleukin (IL)-2 in vitro (Whary et al., 1995). Located on chromosome 7, swine leukocyte antigens (SLA), the equivalent of the mouse major histocompatibilite complex (MHC), have been cloned and sequenced. As they are in other species, SLA class I genes are universal in tissue expression and function to restrict T-cell activation, particularly antiviral immune responses, and are pivotal for inducing tolerance for \u201cself.\u201d The SLA class II genes have been cloned and are restricted in expression to B cells, activated macrophages, a subset of CD8+T cells, and vascular endothelium. The number of SLA class III genes that have been cloned is lower than that found in other species. Member genes of the SLA class III complex function in the complement system, which in the pig is closely aligned with the human systems of classical and alternative pathways of complement activation. One difference is that elimination of antigen\u2013antibody immune complexes occurs through the lung in the pig, in contrast to the target organs of liver and spleen in humans (Davies et al., 1995). Red blood cell antigen classification is very complex in the pig, with 16 genetic systems having been developed that consist of 78 blood factors, which are either antigens of the red blood cell itself or become cell-associated from other tissues when serum concentrations are high (Pescovitz, 1998). Knowledge of red cell surface expression of carbohydrate antigens is important to xenotransplantation because of their role in complement activation, which mediates hyperacute rejection of transplanted tissues.",

Pairing donor and recipient within a line is used to model for transplants between identical human siblings, between lines as a model for nonidentical siblings, and between F1 hydrids for parent-offspring transplants. Intra-SLA recombinant strains have permitted study of SLA class I and II differences and demonstrated the effect of SLA mismatches on graft survival of various tissues. Matching SLA skin grafts typically survive for 7 to 12 days, but vascular grafts and liver transplants survive much longer, some indefinitely. One-third of renal transplants have survived indefinitely, and when rejection did occur, it led to discovery of non-SLA-linked genes that promoted immune-mediated rejection. Acceptance of vascular grafts has been shown to induce tolerance to minor histocompatibility loci, and when performed prior to skin grafting, skin graft survival time was extended. Reversing this process (skin graft first) apparently sensitizes the host to reject vascular grafts hyperacutely.",

Lack of long-term success has generated multiple strategies to minimize rejection. Hyperacute rejection of organs occurs within minutes to hours and is mediated by complement when pig organs are perfused with human or nonhuman primate blood (Saadi and Platt, 1999). High titers of natural \u201cxenoantibodies\u201d in the human (or experimentally, in the nonhuman primate) target carbohydrate antigens, such as Gal(\u03b1l-3),Gal(\u03b1l-4),GlcNAc-R, expressed on donor tissue endothelium, resulting in complement activation and subsequent vascular injury and in severe cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). One strategy has been to eliminate natural xenoantibodies from the circulation of baboons using \u03b1-Gal immunoaffinity columns or extracorporeal perfusion through pig liver; depletion is temporary, on the order of days to weeks (Kozlowski et al., 1998). Sachs unsuccessfully attempted to identify an inbred swine genotype of low \u03b1-Gal expression with the objective of using selective breeding of pigs to decrease \u03b1-Gal expression (Chae et al., 1999). Others have suggested screening specific donors for carbohydrate antigen expression levels as a means to diminish antigenic stimulation of the recipient (Papalois et al., 1999). Brenner et al.

An attractive approach that has shown early promise is the induction of donor-specific tolerance using bone marrow transplantation to create chimeras. Tolerance to fully MHC-mismatched allografts has been demonstrated in mice and primates after first creating a mixed allogeneic hematopoietic chimerism by engrafting donor bone marrow cells into the recipient. However, this hematopoietic chimerism has been difficult to achieve in the discordant pig-to-primate xenogeneic model (Sablinski et al., 1999), most likely due to species-specific differences in regulatory cytokines and elements of the stromal microenvironment (Emery et al., 1999). Representative of a typical experimental protocol and illustrative of the complexities involved, recipient primates underwent whole-body irradiation on days 6 and 5 prior to infusion of pig bone marrow. Primate antipig xenoantibodies were immunoad-sorbed by extracorporeal perfusion of recipient blood through a pig liver immediately before the intravenous infusion of porcine marrow (day 0). In addition to cyclosporine for 4 weeks and 15-deoxyspergualin for 2 weeks, recombinant pig stem-cell factor and interleukin 3 were given for 2 weeks. Recipient primates required 4 weeks to recover from pancytopenia from whole body irradiation, and antipig IgM and IgG antibodies were temporarily depleted by the liver perfusion for 12 to 14 days. About 2% of the myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow of the recipient were of pig origin, and the chimeric animal was less responsive by mixed lymphocyte reaction to pig-specific stimulators. This was the first report of long-term survival of discordant xenogeneic bone marrow in a primate recipient. Others have reported on the poor function of porcine hematopoietic cells in primate marrow microenvironments. Warrens et al. (1998) found differences between swine and human bone marrow cultures in function of two well-characterized ligands known to be important in hematopoiesis, CD44 and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), but they concluded that the differences were not significant enough to explain lack of effective porcine hematopoiesis in the primate marrow, suggesting that other unknown interactions may be important.",

In a mouse model, inhibition of xenoantibody production was accomplished by retroviral transfer into mouse bone marrow of a gene encoding the enzyme that synthesizes swine carbohydrate antigens (Bracy et al., 1998). Gene therapy to express swine SLA class II antigens on baboon autologous bone marrow cells has had limited success (Ierino et al., 1999). Transcription of the transgene was transient, and xenografts were rejected after 8 to 22 days. This experiment was important because it demonstrated that transfer and expression of xenogeneic class II transgenes can be achieved in baboons, and this therapy may prevent late T cell-dependent responses to porcine xenografts, which include induced non-\u03b1-Gal IgG antibody responses. Porcine thymic grafts in immunodeficient mice have been found to support normal development of polyclonal, functional human T cells, and these T cells were specifically tolerant to SLA antigens of the porcine thymus donor, suggesting thymic transplantation may be an approach to achieve tolerance in pig-to-human xenotransplantation (Nikolic et al., 1999).",

Transgenic expression of CD59, a human complement regulatory protein, has promoted survival of swine lungs in a pig-to-primate model (Kulick et al., 2000; Yeatman et al., 1999).

Importantly, immunosuppression may take away the expected barrier of \u201cspecies-specificity\u201d of a potential agent. In addition to the anticipated risks associated with normal flora, environmental contaminants, and true pathogens, there is concern about the unknown risks of viral latency, viral recombination, and endogenous retroviruses (Levy et al., 2000), which in the pig are known to infect human cells in vitro (Weiss et al., 1999; Tacke et al., 2000). In order to minimize risks, donor animals must be free of potential zoonoses and other complicating diseases (Ye et al., 1994). The pig as a model has the advantage that it can be produced under gnotobiotic conditions, and management of newborn piglets from hysterectomy to donation has been described (Munoz et al., 1999). Swindle has suggested that the term \u201cxenograft-defined flora\u201d rather than SPF be used to designate the appropriate health status of donor animals in order to avoid confusion with existing standards (Swindle, 1998).",

Characteristic rhomboid or rectangular-shaped, slightly raised, firm skin lesions are most commonly found on the skin of the abdomen but also on the thighs, ears, snout, throat, and jowls. There is congestion of the spleen, lungs, and liver, and there may be petechial hemorrhages on the surface of the kidneys, on the atrial myocardium, and within lymph nodes (Wood, 1984, 1992). Microscopic lesions in the acute phase are the result of damage done to endothelial cells in capillaries and venules. In the dermal papillae these lead to fibrin deposition, microthrombi and lymphocytic and plasmacytic perivascular infiltrates, and focal necrosis. Chronic lesions are manifested as a proliferative nonsuppurative synovitis and arthritis that results in enlarged joints, most commonly involving the stifle, hock, and carpal joints (Wood, 1984, 1992).",

The virus predominantly impacts the respiratory and nervous systems with related clinical signs. Neonatal pigs typically respond to exposure with acute signs related to the central nervous system (CNS). Affected pigs will tremble, hypersalivate, stumble, and exhibit nystagmus and opisthotonus, often with epileptiform-like seizures. Because of posterior paresis, the animals may be observed actually sitting like a dog. Other signs include circling and paddling, vomiting, and diarrhea. Once CNS signs start, death usually follows within 24\u201336 hr, and mortality approaches 100%. As the pigs age, the clinical signs become less severe, fewer pigs develop CNS involvement, and mortality declines. Respiratory signs characterized by sneezing, nasal discharge, and cough become the hallmark of pigs that are infected at greater than 9 weeks of age. Morbidity rate is high, but mortality is low with uncomplicated CNS signs such as muscle tremors that occur only sporadically. The duration of clinical signs is usually 6\u201310 days, with rapid recovery unless the disease has progressed to pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia has been initiated. Sows and boars also develop primarily respiratory signs, although pregnant animals in the second to third trimester abort and in the first trimester, resorb the fetus.

Indirect transmission can occur by inhalation of aerosolized particles or by contact with contaminated surfaces. Fomite transmission is also possible. Infective levels of virus can persist for up to 7 hr in air with relative humidity of 55% (Schoenbaum et al., 1990). Infective levels of viral particles can also be present in tissues of animals that have died from the disease. Consuming infected carcasses or feed that has been contaminated with the virus is another means of transmission. Evidence indicates that avian species are not a significant contributor to the spread of the virus, and the role of insects in the transmission process has not been adequately evaluated (Zimmerman et al., 1989).

Environmental air pollutants, namely, high ammonia levels (50\u2013100 ppm) and dust (Hamilton et al., 1999), and genetic factors also play a role. Pasteurella multocida strains A and D produce a thermolabile dermonecrotic toxin (DNT), which severely damages the nasal mucosa, producing a progressive form of nasal turbinate atrophy. Bordetella bronchiseptica also produces a heat-labile DNT and alone will produce a moderate self-limiting form of the disease in which damaged tissues may regenerate in time (Tibor, 1999). Haemophilus parasuis reportedly causes a mild turbinate atrophy (Cowart, 1995). Combined infections of toxigenic P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica produce the most severe form. Typically, two or more infectious organisms are required to produce clinical disease with permanent nasal distortion and turbinate atrophy. Recently, the term \u201cnonprogressive atrophic rhinitis\u201d (NPAR) has been applied to the form caused by B. bronchiseptica alone, and the term \u201cprogressive atrophic rhinitis\u201d (PAR) to P. multocida alone and combined infections of P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica (De Jong, 1999).",

Brachygnathia superior (BS) is the most common form seen and is due to slower bone growth in the upper jaw which gives it an upturned appearance. Significant turbinate atrophy can be present without visible snout abnormalities. Commonly, this atrophy is subjectively measured at necropsy by visual scoring of a section at the level of the second premolar. Techniques for objective quantification of this atrophy by digital image analysis or digitization (Gatlin et al., 1996) and computed tomography (Shryock et al., 1998) have been published. The latter method allows morphometric analysis of live pigs. In the more severe cases, whole-body growth rate will be decreased (De Jong, 1999), and this may be due in part to the possibility that the toxin produced affects the growth of the skeletal system (Ackermann et al., 1996). Differentials for PAR include other causes of facial deformities, including paranasal abscesses and breed variations.",

Primary isolation may be achieved by cross-streaking on a blood agar plate with a staphylococcus, which produces NAD. Termed \u201csatellitism\u201d or \u201csatellite phenomenon,\u201d this will allow growth near the staphylococcus colonies.

Recent in vitro susceptibility studies have shown that valnemulin has exceptional activity against M. hyopneumoniae, and perhaps in vivo trials will validate this as another effective antibiotic treatment for MPS (Hannan et al., 1997).",

Antigenic comparison of the H1N1 swine viruses has shown, in contrast to human strains, that there has been little antigenic variation over the last 50 years (Sherrar et al., 1989).

The provision of bedding material is associated with a higher incidence of A. suum infection than in bedding-free housing systems (Dangolla et al., 1996). Neopredisan (p-chloro-m-cresol) disinfectant has been shown to be a very efficacious ovicide and larvicide for A. suum (Mielke and Hiepe, 1998). This coupled with a strategic or continuous anthelmintic treatment program should eliminate clinical disease. If outdoor pens are utilized, housing on concrete or bringing the animals indoors to prevent access to earthworms and to facilitate sanitation and anthelmintic treatment is worthwhile. Feral Sus scrofa in the United States and Europe have been found to have A. suum and Metastrongylus spp. (Gipson et al., 1999; Henne et al., 1978) and are a potential reservoir in areas where contact is possible. It is recommended that health monitoring for these pathogens be done on any wild populations. An indirect ELISA for anti\u2013A. suum IgG is more sensitive and probably provides a more realistic assessment of the prevalence than fecal examination for oocysts (Roepstorff, 1998).",

The AEEC porcine organisms attach to enterocyte microvilli by means of an attachment factor and then efface the microvilli and invade the epithelial cells (Gyles and Thoen, 1993). The ETEC organisms contain a mucopolysaccharide capsule that is antiphagocytic and not very antigenic. The Kl polysaccharide enhances bacterial resistance to complement mediated killing by inhibiting the alternative pathway to complement activation. The very long O chain polysaccharide chains in the cell wall bind the membrane attack complex resulting from complement activation distant from the cell membrane so that it cannot lyse the cell (Gyles and Thoen, 1993). Specialized fimbriae, K88(F4), K99(F5), F6, and F41, permit the adherence and colonization of the enterocytes. The ETEC also produce heat-labile toxins, which elevate levels of adenylate cyclase leading to the efflux of Na and CI ions and water out of the cell. In addition, SLT-IIe, a heat-labile, Shiga-like toxin, binds to and damages vascular endothelium, resulting in edema, hemorrhage, and thrombosis (Gyles and Thoen, 1993). The heat-stable toxins Sta and Stb cause elevated levels of prostaglandins in enterocytes, which may enhance diarrhea (Gyles and Thoen, 1993).",

The piglets are usually severely dehydrated, and there is no chyle in the lymphatic channels in the mesentery (Hooper and Haelterman, 1966, 1969). The most striking microscopic lesion is the severe villus atrophy in the jejunum and ileum, which causes a massive loss of mature absorptive enterocytes. The villus crypt ratio is 1:1, compared to a normal of about 7:1 (Hooper and Haelterman, 1966, 1969). The enterocytes are vacuolated and low-cuboidal or flattened, there is lymphoid depletion of Peyer's patches, and there is a minimal inflammatory response in the lamina propria (Hooper and Haelterman, 1969).

The sows can be washed with appropriate antibacterials (chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine shampoos) prior to parturition, and any sharp or abrasive surfaces removed from the pens. The animals should be checked to be sure that they are free of mange and lice, as these may irritate the skin.

The chronic form is characterized by late-term abortions, stillbirths, and weak newborn piglets. This is particularly true of serovar pomona infection. Infertility of the sow is seen following infections due to serovar bratislava; however, reproductive performance following abortions due to pomona is not affected (Ellis, 1999).

In the subacute or chronic form, the animal will be anemic and anorexic, with passage of dark feces that may be intermittent or persistent. Occasionally, the only sign observed may be the passage of dark, hard feces. Pigs of either sex and any breed may be affected. Usually, single pigs are affected, and body temperature is normal or slightly subnormal. Anemia can be detected hematologically if the chronic/subacute form is present. Differential diagnoses include swine dysentery, Salmonella choleraesuis, transmissible gastroenteritis, and intestinal hemorrhagic syndrome.

One study investigated the prevalence of Gastrospirillum suis in pigs with gastric ulcer but found no correlation between its presence and the occurrence of ulceration (Barbosa et al., 1995).

Factors contributing to this condition include congenital abnormalities, trauma caused by the female, chilling, and female hypogalactia. Infectious hypogalactia (also referred to as MMA for mastitis, metritis, and agalactia) is a condition in which one or more of the mammary glands are inflamed and infected with gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxin release interferes with the release of prolactin and subsequently prevents milk letdown. Oxytocin, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory drugs are helpful.

The clinical outcomes are damaged areas of skin that can become infected, leading to abscesses (Huey, 1996), poor performance (Wallgren and Lindahl, 1996), suppurative arthritis (Cowart, 1995), and possible mortality. The basis for this behavior probably stems from the natural tendency of pigs to root and chew to obtain food in their natural environment. In confined group housing, pen mates, for lack of anything better, take the place of natural rooting structures. Iron deficiency anemia has been considered a possible cause for this behavior in piglets. Inadequate ambient temperature control, ventilation, pen and feeder space, and access to water (Rizvi et al., 1998) are also considered contributing factors. However, the most plausible explanation is the lack of sufficient environmental enrichment. Corrective measures should include access to rooting materials, including wood-chip bedding, straw, and \u201cindestructible\u201d polyethylene balls. When groups are formed, the animals should be of similar age and size and of numbers appropriate for the space. Tail docking is also considered a preventive measure since this reduces the incidence of tail biting (Hemsworth, 1999).",
