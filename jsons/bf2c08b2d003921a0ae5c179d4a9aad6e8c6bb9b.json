The main advantage of pleuroscopy is the ability to achieve early diagnosis of MPE when pleural fl uid cytology and closed-needle pleural biopsy have failed. It allows inspection of approximately 75% of the visceral pleural surface as well as of the parietal pleural surface ( Fig. 64.1 ). Boutin reported that in 85% of patients with MPE, thoracoscopy revealed visual features suggestive of malignancy, including nodules, polypoid lesions, localized masses, thickened pleural surface, and poorly vascularized pachypleuritis. However, since appearances can be misleading -some malignancies may appear in fl ammatory while some in fl ammatory lesions can look like tumors -macroscopic diagnoses must always be con fi rmed by histology. Biopsies can be visually directed in instances where tumor deposits appear to be localized (Figs. 64.2 and 64.3 ). In addition, biopsy specimens can be obtained from multiple sites and are of greater size and depth, factors that improve the diagnostic yield (Figs. 64.4 and 64.5 ). The larger sample sizes increases the ability of the pathologist to make an accurate diagnosis; the pathologist, for example, can better differentiate malignant mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma and can perform special studies such as hormone receptor assays or genetic marker studies on the tissue that help determine prognosis and guide therapy.",

The cause of dyspnea, the most frequent and often the most distressing symptom, is likely multifactorial and can be due to compressive atelectasis, decreased lung compliance causing increased work of breathing, and worsened ventilationperfusion mismatching causing hypoxemia.

In addition to playing an integral role in the diagnosis of a MPE, thoracentesis also plays a central role in the palliative treatment when a large volume of pleural fl uid is drained. Indeed, if a MPE is strongly suspected in a patient with a newly noted pleural effusion, both a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis can be combined in one procedure. By draining a large volume of fl uid, one can assess whether the patient's symptoms, particularly dyspnea, improve and whether the underlying lung reexpands radiographically. If symptoms signi fi cantly improve, other drainage procedures can be planned such as tube drainage and pleurodesis. If symptoms do not improve, other causes of the dyspnea should be considered, including underlying lung or heart disease, venous thromboembolism, chemotherapy-or radiation therapy-induced lung injury, tumor emboli, or pulmonary lymphangitic tumor spread. If the lung does not reexpand to touch the chest wall, one must consider pleural adhesions or lung entrapment by tumor preventing full expansion or atelectasis due to endobronchial obstruction by tumor. Such fi ndings can affect diagnostic and treatment decisions; for example, diagnostic and therapeutic The use of ultrasound guidance for localization of the pleural effusion and to determine the optimal entry point for drainage before performing thoracentesis is becoming standard practice. Besides localizing pleural fl uid, it also helps identify adhesions and fl uid loculations and helps avoid puncturing visceral organs. Pleural manometry, although not yet widely adopted, can be helpful in identifying patients with trapped lung because of abnormally negative intrapleural pressures and may also help prevent reexpansion pulmonary edema by stopping drainage when intrapleural pressures exceed \u221220 cm H 2 O (or when patients experience chest discomfort, which can be a surrogate for extremely negative intrapleural pressures.) The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the most recent British Thoracic Society (BTS) practice guidelines continue to recommend limiting fl uid withdrawal to <1.5 L during thoracentesis to avoid reexpansion pulmonary edema, in the absence of pleural manometry.",

For chest tube drainage, the current BTS guidelines for the management of malignant pleural effusions recommend the insertion of a small-bore intercostal tube, controlled evacuation of fl uid (initial drainage of 1.5 L, and 1.5 L at a time every 2 h) to prevent reexpansion pulmonary edema and radiographic con fi rmation of chest tube placement and lung reexpansion.",

The typical dose of talc when given as a slurry is 5.0 g diluted in 50-100 ml of normal saline. Common adverse effects of talc, likely secondary to pleural in fl ammation, include pain and discomfort, fever (which is common and often transient), hypoxemia (in up to 30% of patients), and dyspnea. Less common side effects include pneumonia, arrhythmias, and empyema. Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to talc has been described by several authors and does not appear to be related to dose or method of delivery but may be related to talc particle size. The talc available in Europe (mean particle size >20 m m) has not been reported to cause ARDS, as opposed to the talc available in the United States (the only FDA-approved preparation is Sclerosol \u00ae ), which contains particles <10 m m. It has been hypothesized that talc with smaller particle sizes (<10 m m) can be systemically absorbed into the vascular beds and cause an in fl ammatory reaction in the lung resulting in an acute pneumonitis or ARDS. The incidence of respiratory failure in patients with MPE receiving talc slurry for pleurodesis was 4% in a prospective randomized trial. Despite the potential adverse effects, talc remains the most commonly used pleural sclerosant because of its wide availability, low expense, and good ef fi cacy.",

There are several theoretical advantages to thoracoscopic talc insuf fl ation compared with talc slurry sclerosis. Medical thoracoscopy allows complete effusion drainage under direct visualization and optimal chest tube positioning. Talc is insuf fl ated in a manner that allows even distribution over the entire visceral and parietal pleural surfaces. In contrast, the slurry of waterinsoluble talc may gravitate to the dependent part of the pleural space shortly after instillation. Finally, in patients with an underlying malignancy but negative fl uid cytology, parietal pleural biopsies of suspicious areas can be taken at the time of medical thoracoscopy, before proceeding with pleurodesis. A systematic review comparing the various treatment options to achieve pleurodesis in patients with MPE was published in the Cochrane Database in 2004. The comparison of thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis (TTP) and talc slurry pleurodesis favored thoracoscopic pleurodesis, with a relative risk for nonrecurrence of the effusion of 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04-1.36).",

Overall, no difference was detected in the percentage of patients with successful pleurodesis at 30 days (78% for TTP and 71% for talc slurry). However, in the subgroup of patients with primary lung or breast cancer, the success rate of TTP was found to be signi fi cantly higher than with talc slurry (65% vs. 50%, p = 0.014). Lung cancer and breast cancer are the fi rst and second most common neoplasms causing malignant effusions, and these fi ndings suggest that TTP may be a better option for a large proportion of patients Fig. 64.7 Sterile talc that has been sterilized and packaged in a pressurized canister (Sclerosol \u00ae ) for talc poudrage during medical thoracoscopy with MPE. Moreover, a subgroup analysis of those patients with lung cancer or breast cancer who achieved lung expansion after drainage of the fl uid (and therefore did not have radiographic evidence for trapped lung) and were alive at 30 days showed that TTP achieved successful pleurodesis more frequently compared to talc slurry (82% vs. 67%, p = 0.022).",

It should be demonstrated that drainage of the fl uid results in symptom relief, that pleurodesis is achievable since the lung is expandable, that the patient can tolerate moderate sedation required for thoracoscopy, and that the patient can tolerate the procedure itself. In a study examining predictors of survival in patients with symptomatic MPE referred for TTP, the authors concluded that performance status, as measured by the Karnofsky score, was the best predictor. The authors proposed that a Karnofsky score \u00b3 70 (which re fl ects a patient who is ambulatory and living independently) may be a reasonable marker for deciding which patients with MPE should undergo TTP. In patients with MPE, overall prognosis should thus be considered in the selection of patients for TTP. As an example, a patient with MPE who has a Karnofsky score of \u00b3 70 and an expected prognosis of more than 6 months might be an excellent candidate for TTP, whereas other options (such as tunneled pleural catheters, which will be described later, or palliative care) should be considered for a patient with a poor performance status and an expected survival of less than 1-2 months.",

The median duration of hospitalization following the procedure was 1.79 days, and the tunneled pleural catheter was removed at a median of 7.54 days.
