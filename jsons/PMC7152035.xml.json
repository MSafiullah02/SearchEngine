More elaborate and sensitive detection methods (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or tissue urease activity) are research tools rarely if ever used in a diagnostic setting. In the past 15 years, there have been at least nine studies specifically examining the relationship between Helicobacter infection, development of histologic lesions, and clinical disease. None of these studies has proven any causal relationship between infection and disease.13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 All but one, however, have claimed that infection is associated with an increase in gastric mucosal leukocytes, fibrosis, and lymphoid follicles. The problem is that the increased leukocytes claimed to represent \u201cgastritis\u201d invariably fall within the normal range for gastric mucosal cellularity as established by Southorn and as subsequently adopted by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) Gastrointestinal Standardization Group.12, 14 Most of those studies had no uninfected control against which to measure the claims for increased cellularity. Even if one were to accept the hypothesis that colonization by Helicobacter causes a small increase in mucosal leukocytes (including lymphofollicular hyperplasia), the most plausible explanation is that the Helicobacter simply represent an increased antigenic challenge to the resident mucosal leukocytes that respond in an entirely appropriate fashion, analogous to what occurs when gnotobiotic animals are first introduced to a \u201cnormal\u201d bacterial flora.31\n",

Many examples lie in the middle of that continuum, and pathologists are not uniform in how they classify these. Leiomyomas are formed by cells virtually indistinguishable from normal smooth muscle, except that they grow in interlacing bundles to create a disorganized nodule clearly different from the surrounding, laminar arrangement of the tunica muscularis.

The challenges of successful endoscopic biopsy are numerous and are dealt with elsewhere in this text. From the pathologist's perspective, the number, size, and handling of such samples is directly related to outcome (i.e., a meaningful histopathology report). A minimum of six to eight biopsies of duodenal and ileal mucosa should be collected, and these should be sufficiently deep to include the entire mucosa to the level of muscularis mucosa (Fig. 29-14\n).

This prevents disruption of the tissue following any vigorous agitation that might occur while the samples are in transit. Most histology laboratories are willing to supply these sponges and cassettes.

A final consideration is that the microscopic interpretation of intestinal biopsies (particularly endoscopic samples) is not a simple procedure. There is considerable interobserver variation in assessment of intestinal biopsies between different pathologists.71 The WSAVA Gastrointestinal Standardization Group has proposed that intestinal biopsies should be evaluated in a systematic way using a \u201ctick-box\u201d list that encourages the pathologist to examine and record all of the salient aspects of the samples.11 In this way, the clinician can be ensured that all relevant components of the tissue were examined, even if they were histologically normal. Most initial microscopic evaluation will be done with sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), but the pathologist should be able to follow this up where required with other histochemical stains (e.g., for identification of some infectious agents, for delineation of collagen in fibrosis).10 It is also now generally possible for the pathologist to request immunohistochemical labeling, particularly in the case of phenotypic identification of round cell or stromal tumors. Clinicians should always develop a close working relationship with their pathology laboratory, and feel comfortable about contacting the pathologist to discuss further any particular case.",

            "text": "Similar data are reported for the feline small intestine66 but these highlight some interesting differences between the two species. While cats also have more T cells in the villus (compared with cryptal) lamina propria, there is only enrichment of IgM and IgA plasma cells within cryptal lamina propria\u2014with equal numbers of IgG plasma cells in villus and cryptal lamina. Also in contrast to the dog, cats have increasing numbers of T cells from duodenum to ileum, and an increase (as opposed to a decrease) in IgA plasma cells from anterior to distal small intestine. The two most striking differences between these species lies with epithelial expression of class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and with the numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) (Fig. 29-18\n). Whereas dogs display constitutive epithelial expression of MHC class II, the normal feline enterocyte layer is devoid of this molecule.20, 66 Additionally, cats have significantly more IELs than dogs, with an increasing number of these cells from duodenum to ileum (there is no anatomical difference in the dog). The majority of feline IELs are CD8+ (with an \u03b1\u03b1 homodimer)52 and express the \u03b1E integrin that likely mediates their interaction with the epithelium.73 It has been suggested that some of these changes may reflect the relatively greater number of microbial flora that are proposed to lie within the small intestinal lumen of the cat.32, 45\n",

The three major noninfectious inflammatory diseases of the canine small intestine are idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), food responsive diarrhea (FRD; also referred to as dietary hypersensitivity or food allergy), and antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ARD; small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [SIBO]). The first two of these are also well-recognized in the cat. These disorders likely share elements of pathogenesis relating to the interaction between the intestinal immune system and bacterial or food antigens, and there is probably a pathologic continuum with overlap between the three entities.23 A range of canine breed\u2013associated enteropathies (e.g., those affecting Irish Setters,50 soft-coated Wheaten Terriers,61 Norwegian Lundehunds,14 and Basenjis4) also likely fits within this pathologic spectrum. The clinical and pathologic definition of these specific diseases remains problematic, but all may involve a small intestinal mucosal inflammatory response, generally characterized by lymphoplasmacytic and/or eosinophilic infiltration.29, 30, 32, 67, 74 Alternatively, examples of all three disorders are commonly found where there is no clear evidence for intestinal inflammation.",

The morphologic criteria that define small intestinal inflammation include villus stunting and fusion (Fig. 29-19\n), epithelial injury, crypt dilation, distention or abscessation (Fig. 29-20\n), lacteal dilation, and fibrosis. The types of inflammatory infiltrate that may occur are lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, or neutrophilic (Fig. 29-21\n). Mixtures of these three types of response may also occur.

Extensive lacteal dilation is also a hallmark of the entity termed lymphangiectasia, in which there is \u201cballooning\u201d dilation of the lacteals accompanied by lamina propria edema and loss of lymphatic fluid (and associated cells and protein) into the intestinal lumen (protein-losing enteropathy) (Fig. 29-22\n). Affected villi are generally blunt. Lymphatic vessels in the submucosa, muscularis, serosa, and mesentery may also be dilated. Lymphangiectasia is recognized in the dog and may be a congenital developmental disorder or be acquired secondary to occlusion of lymphatic outflow by inflammatory or neoplastic processes.37, 58 Increased lamina propria cellularity is described in some cases, and specific elevation in the numbers of IgG plasma cells has been described. Lymphangiectasia may be accompanied by the formation of discrete microgranulomata (lipogranulomas) within the submucosa or deeper regions that generally center upon lymphatic vessels.63 These inflammatory foci contain numerous highly vacuolated macrophages (lipophages) that take up the lipid-rich chyle that leaks from affected vessels. It is more likely that these lesions are a sequel to, rather than an initiating cause of, occluded lymphatic outflow. These key lesions may only be visualized on full-thickness (as opposed to perendoscopic) biopsy. As a distinct histopathologic syndrome, some dogs with protein-losing enteropathy have prominent crypt dilation/abscessation with mild lymphatic dilation, but an absence of villus pathology or mucosal inflammatory infiltration.70\n",

One example of such change is that which accompanies parvovirus infection of the cryptal epithelia. The hallmark features of parvoviral enteritis in dogs and cats are extreme villus atrophy, crypt dilation, and distention, with characteristic epithelial necrosis and bizarre squamoid morphology of surviving cells, and minimal lamina propria inflammation (Fig. 29-23\n).5, 64 Later in the course of disease there may be crypt hypertrophy as a consequence of compensatory crypt epithelial hyperplasia/regeneration. Feline leukemia virus has been proposed as a cause of cryptal necrosis similar to that caused by parvovirus. By contrast, feline (and canine) coronavirus enteritis causes loss of enterocytes from the tips of villi rather than affecting the crypts. Antigen from all three feline viruses may be identified within intestinal tissue by immunohistochemistry.34 Crypt epithelial proliferation and mucosal erosion may occur in young pups with Campylobacter enteropathy and these bacteria may be identified within the crypt epithelial cell cytoplasm.12 By contrast, in canine peracute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (most often affecting young animals of toy and miniature breeds and suggested to have clostridial etiology; Clostridium perfringens type A) there is hemorrhagic necrosis of the mucosa with sparing of the crypts. In both dogs and cats, clinical disease and intestinal pathology associated with \u201cattaching and effacing\u201d Escherichia coli (AEEC) is recognized but in many cases other concurrent intestinal pathogens are identified.65\n",

In this instance, the pathology is generally serosal (rather than mucosal) and characterized by the presence of vasculocentric pyogranulomatous reactions thought to be initiated by the deposition of antigen\u2013antibody immune complexes (Fig. 29-24\n). Granulomatous enteritis secondary to mycobacterial infection may also occur in cats and dogs following ingestion of unpasteurized bovine milk or infected small rodent prey (Fig. 29-25\n). In certain geographical areas (e.g., the southern United States), granulomatous enteritis caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum is prevalent in dogs.7 Canine histoplasmosis most commonly affects the ileum and colon and organisms are prominent within the cytoplasm of infiltrating macrophages (Fig. 29-26\n). Hemorrhagic granulomatous enteritis may also occur in canine \u201csalmon poisoning\u201d in which dogs ingest salmon infected by the fluke Nanophyetus salminicola, which transmits the causative rickettsial organism Neorickettsia helminthoeca. Granulomas with prominent eosinophil infiltration may surround fragments of migrating Toxocara canis in the intestine of young dogs with poor husbandry. This change is generally considered an incidental finding, but has been termed canine multifocal eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The attachment of hookworms to the small intestinal mucosa may also induce local tissue damage related to the ingestion of blood by the parasite. Tapeworms also attach to the intestinal mucosa, but they generally have minimal clinical significance for the host. Although primarily a colonic infection, Tritrichomonas foetus may also infect and induce inflammation in the ileum of cats. Small intestinal giardiasis is not uncommon in young dogs and cats, but the Giardia organisms produce little intestinal pathology other than damage to the enterocyte microvillus border.",

These tumors may be of epithelial, mesenchymal, or hemopoietic origin. A frequent small intestinal neoplasm is alimentary lymphoma, which may concurrently involve other regions of the GI tract or mesenteric lymph nodes. Alimentary lymphoma is the most common tumor of the small intestine in cats. With the advent of successful vaccination and testing programs for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection there has been a change in the epidemiology of feline lymphoma. This disease now occurs principally in an older cohort of cats, is more likely to be unassociated with FeLV infection, and most frequently has alimentary distribution.62 In one study from Australia (where FeLV infection is uncommon), 15 of 118 cats with lymphoma had only intestinal involvement, a further 20 cats had alimentary lymphoma with involvement of other abdominal viscera, and another 25 cats had alimentary lymphoma with concurrent involvement of nonabdominal viscera.18 In a retrospective study from California, 186 of 257 cases of feline lymphoma were recorded as having primary intestinal disease. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal lymphoma had increased in the latter 10 years of this 1983 to 2003 survey.38 Feline alimentary lymphoma may give rise to a discrete nodular mass(es) within the intestine and/or may involve diffuse infiltration of the intestinal wall without producing mass lesions. The tumor may arise at any level of the gastrointestinal tract.",

Three distinct morphologic/phenotypic variants are described: small-cell lymphocytic villus lymphoma, large-cell or lymphoblastic lymphoma, and large granular lymphoma. Small-cell lymphocytic villus lymphoma affects older cats and begins as an accumulation of small T lymphocytes at the base of the villus. These cells gradually extend throughout the lamina propria and into the epithelium, and eventually the infiltrate becomes transmural.6 Large-cell (lymphoblastic) lymphoma affects cats of any age and is a more aggressive, rapidly progressing, transmural tumor that forms nodular masses and metastasizes to mesenteric lymph nodes. At least a proportion of these tumors are of the B-cell phenotype. Large granular lymphoma is an aggressive metastatic form of disease involving large epitheliotropic lymphocytes with distinctive eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules that contain the molecule perforin immunohistochemically.9, 33 This finding suggested that these cells may be either cytotoxic T lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells, but further phenotypic investigation revealed that they are CD3+ and also express a CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimer, and are therefore likely to be intraepithelial T lymphocytes.51 These large granular lymphocytes are also considered to be the same population as \u201cfeline globular leukocytes.\u201d Recent immunophenotypic studies have characterized the majority of feline alimentary lymphomas as being T-cell in phenotype (some of which may be epitheliotropic), but B-cell lymphoma or mixed phenotype tumors also occur.40, 68 By contrast, other studies report a dominance of B-cell lymphoma affecting the feline alimentary tract.17 There is no clear evidence that immunophenotype is associated with survival time for feline alimentary lymphoma.46\n",

Transcoelomic or hematogenous metastasis is rare. Microscopically, there is often a marked scirrhous reaction with small nests of pleomorphic tumor cells embedded within this matrix (Fig. 29-28\n).

The normal canine colonic mucosa is made up primarily of straight cylindrical crypts oriented perpendicular to the underlying muscularis mucosa. The crypts lie against each other, surrounded by a cell-poor lamina propria populated by stromal cells, vessels, and a sparse population of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and mast cells. The base of each crypt is separated from the muscularis mucosa by no more than four cellular layers, in which eosinophils are often prominent. In dogs, crypt length varies from 400 to 600 \u00b5m, and in two-dimensional histologic sections consists of two parallel columns each with about 100 simple columnar epithelial cells. The lining of the superficial three quarters of the crypts appears dominated by goblet cells, but in fact the crypts are populated by a mixture of goblet cells, neuroendocrine cells, columnar absorption of epithelium, and germinal basal cells. Goblet cells are claimed to account for only approximately 10% of the total, but the distended mucus goblets often seem to crowd out the other cells and in routine histologic sections create the visual impression of an almost pure goblet cell population (Fig. 29-29\n).

Those residual lesions include one or more of mucosal fibrosis, cryptal atrophy or tortuosity, and increased leukocytes with no evidence of active epithelial injury or vascular changes appropriate to active inflammation. Considering the waxing and waning clinical signs in many examples of canine or feline colitis and the rapidity of colonic repair, we need to pay much more attention to when the biopsies were taken relative to the last \u201cepisode\u201d of clinical disease when assessing colonic biopsies. Lesions of mature mucosal fibrosis and mucosal atrophy are not likely to be relevant if the biopsies were taken in the midst of an acute episode of classical colitis; on the other hand, they may be extremely significant as a footprint of previous inflammatory disease if the biopsies were taken, for example, 2 weeks after the last episode (which is often the case just because of scheduling appointments with a specialist).",

HUC is a distinct disease syndrome with characteristic histologic lesions seen in young Boxers and French Bulldogs. It is a chronic, progressive, and eventually transmural disease characterized initially by shallow microscopic erosion and ulceration of the colonic surface and by an accumulation of large epithelioid macrophages containing PAS-positive cytoplasmic vacuoles between the muscularis mucosa and the base of the colonic crypts (Figure 29-36, Figure 29-37\n). Over time, the number of macrophages increases dramatically, with extension into submucosa and spread via lymphatics to occupy large portions of the draining colonic lymph nodes.11, 12 The granulomatous proliferative disease is usually more obvious than the ulceration. In the early disease, the patchy deep mucosal granulomatous infiltrates can be missed if one is looking only at shallow endoscopic biopsies. For many years, this disease was considered idiopathic and invariably fatal. More recently, the observation that most cases responded to antibiotic treatment with enrofloxacin stimulated a resurgence of interest in this disease.13 Subsequently, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in colonic biopsies from affected dogs and subsequent genomic analysis identified specific strains of Escherichia coli capable of adhering to, invading, and replicating within colonic epithelium. These strains were not found in colonic biopsies from healthy dogs and clinical response to treatment was accompanied by disappearance of the organisms.14 Why the disease is limited almost exclusively to Boxers and related French Bulldogs remains an intriguing mystery worth solving.",

They originate from epithelial cells in the crypts, invade across the muscularis mucosa and into the submucosa, and spread by direct extension and intralymphatic permeation through the muscularis propria. They then implant throughout the peritoneal cavity, and can also spread by lymphatic and venous dissemination to liver, lung, and any other location. They are often quite well-differentiated mucus-producing tubular carcinomas, and traditionally induce substantial scirrhous reaction. In the colon, however, approximately 25% of carcinomas are, at the time of initial diagnosis, extremely well-differentiated intraluminal papillary tumors that are seen rarely if ever in stomach or small intestine. If sampled just by shallow endoscopic biopsies, these can be mistaken for hyperplastic polyps (especially in dogs and especially if they occur in rectal mucosa where they overlap grossly and histologically with harmless rectal polyps). The key to the diagnosis of carcinoma is that these well-differentiated hyperchromatic columnar epithelial cells invade across the basement membrane and into the lamina propria (Fig. 29-42\n). In biopsies that are deep enough, one can usually detect at least some invasion into the submucosa.

Infiltrates of neutrophils frequently accompany both pancreatic necrosis and peripancreatic fat necrosis (Figure 29-48, Figure 29-49) and exacerbate injury to the pancreas by the release of enzymes. Septa between lobules are usually expanded by hemorrhage, fibrin, neutrophils, and macrophages. There may be local destruction of small blood vessels associated with hemorrhage, and thrombi are common in small veins and arteries in severe disease (Fig. 29-50\n) leading to further ischemic damage to the pancreas. Thrombi may extend into the portal vein from the pancreas.13\n",

Carcinomas may present as a single nodule or coalescing nodules that may extend into the adjacent mesentery or invade the duodenum or liver (Fig. 29-60\n). The cells form ducts, tubules, or acini or have a solid pattern. The neoplastic cells exhibit a broad range of morphologies, from relatively well-differentiated acinar or ductular cells (Fig. 29-61\n) to poorly differentiated anaplastic polygonal cells with large nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, scant amphophilic to basophilic cytoplasm, and numerous mitotic figures. In anaplastic tumors it may not be possible to determine if the tumor is of exocrine or endocrine (islet) origin by routine light microscopy. Islet cell tumors may be positive for insulin, glucagon, or somatostatin and are usually positive for chromogranin by immunohistochemistry. Carcinomas may spread into the adjacent duodenum, stomach, and liver, and also spread throughout the abdomen (carcinomatosis). Pancreatic carcinomas frequently elicit a desmoplastic response with cells surrounded by fibroblasts and collagen (Fig. 29-62\n).

There are a number of models that describe the structural unit of the liver.1, 2 In this section, the standard lobule is used as the structural unit of the liver. The liver is a three-dimensional structure and can be envisioned as a tightly packed cluster of grapes with each grape representing a lobule. From the two-dimensional microscopic perspective the \u201ctypical\u201d lobule is outlined by a hexagon of portal tracts about 1 mm in diameter with a central vein (terminal hepatic venule) at its center, although some lobules form imperfect hexagons (Fig. 29-63\n). Portal tracts usually contain a branch of the portal vein and one or two branches of the hepatic artery, as well as a bile duct. In addition, the portal tract contains abundant connective tissue as well as lymphatics and nerves. However, there is normal variation in the number of bile ducts and hepatic artery branches. Usually, the portal vein profile is larger than the surface area of the bile ducts and the hepatic arteries. There is a distinct border between the portal tract connective tissue and the initial surrounding row of hepatocytes, termed the limiting plate. Between the portal tract and the central vein the hepatocytes are arranged in radial plates that are one or occasionally two cells thick. Normal hepatocytes have abundant cytoplasm that is more than three to four times the surface area of nucleus and the cytoplasm may be vacuolated to various extents. Frequently, there is a mild to moderate coarse, irregular, clear vacuolation caused by the presence of stored glycogen. Hepatocytes may vary in size in response to systemic or localized factors. Blood oxygen is highest in the periportal regions of the lobule where blood from the portal veins enters the sinusoids and lowest in the centrilobular areas. Centrilobular hepatocytes may become smaller than normal when blood oxygen levels become too low (e.g., during anemia or chronic congestion) or hepatocyte oxygen demands increase (e.g., during heat stroke). Centrilobular hepatocytes may become enlarged where there is induction of drug metabolizing enzymes as these enzymes are in the highest concentration in these hepatocytes. In older cats, the centrilobular hepatocytes often contain brown granular lipofuscin pigment. Mitotic activity of hepatocytes is rarely seen in the normal liver.",

The optimal size of the biopsy is determined by balancing the need for sufficient tissue to enable diagnosis and the clinician's concern for the patient. Disorders with diffuse and uniform appearance require the least amount of tissue to make a diagnosis. Other disorders, particularly chronic inflammation, can vary from lobe to lobe and even within a lobe and require multiple sections for accurate assessment of the health of the liver. Wedge biopsies provide a more accurate view of most liver disorders than needle biopsies,3 but it is disappointing, at the least, for the pathologist to receive a single wedge of liver after the patient has undergone a laparotomy. Despite the apparent normality of liver at surgery, histologic evaluation is frequently useful. Multiple small wedges from several lobes are preferred over a larger section from a single lobe. Needle biopsies can be sufficient for many approaches, but multiple biopsies from more than one liver lobe are desired. In any event, properly collected and handled tissue is essential for optimal microscopic evaluation. Once collected, the liver tissue should be handled as little as possible to avoid physical distortion or loss of tissue. This is particularly true of needle biopsies. Small or fragmented biopsies can be placed into embedding bags or plastic cassettes with a screen mesh. In most circumstances, the tissue should be placed immediately into 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissue should not be more than 0.5 to 1 cm at its greatest thickness and the ratio of formalin to tissue should be 10 : 1. If immunohistochemistry (IHC) is to be performed, the tissue should be processed within 48 hours to avoid overfixation.",

            "text": "A congenital portosystemic shunt is an abnormal vascular channel that allows a portion of the blood within the portal venous system to bypass the liver and to drain into the systemic circulation. Shunts occur most commonly in the dog, but are also described in cats.5 A congenital shunt can be either intra- or extrahepatic in location, but is almost always limited to a single vessel.5 Extrahepatic congenital shunts can occur between a variety of sites within the portal drainage and the systemic venous system. Extrahepatic shunts occur more often in small breeds of dog. Typically, intrahepatic portosystemic shunts involve failure of closure of the fetal ductus venosus at birth. These shunts, like the ductus venosus, are most often located in the left side of the liver. This anomaly occurs most often in large breed dogs. Regardless of the site of the shunt, affected animals are typically stunted and frequently develop signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The liver is small and microscopically displays hepatocellular and lobular atrophy.5 There is an increase in the profiles of hepatic arterioles within the portal areas, presumed to relate to a compensatory increase in systemic arterial blood flow, in response to the inadequate portal flow. There is also sometimes a proliferation of small caliber bile ducts. Portal vein profiles are smaller than normal or absent (Fig. 29-64\n). Changes in the central and sublobular veins are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Dogs have a spiral smooth muscle surrounding the hepatic veins that can contract to restrict blood flow from the liver. This muscle constricts in response to various pharmacologic agents and presumably in shock. In some instances, dogs with hypoperfusion of the portal vein, regardless of the cause, have constricted smooth muscle, leading to a small-caliber hepatic vein with prominent smooth muscle (Fig. 29-65\n). This change has been misinterpreted as \u201carterialization\u201d of hepatic veins. Surrounding lymphatics are also often distended. Variable numbers of lipogranulomas, collections of vacuolated and pigmented macrophages, can be found in the parenchyma or within the portal areas. Portal vein pressure is normal in congenital shunts and ascites does not occur. At postmortem examination abnormal vascular anastomoses are often difficult to identify without the benefit of antemortem imaging studies to localize the shunting vessel. The histologic appearance of congenital portosystemic shunts and other vascular anomalies of the liver have considerable overlap as the liver has a stereotypical response to inadequate portal perfusion. Clinical data, such as the presence or absence of shunt vessels and the determination of portal vein pressure, may be needed to achieve a final diagnosis.",

Some cells in the ductal plate mature into the bile duct system, whereas others undergo apoptosis. Disturbances in development of this cell population give rise to a variety of biliary developmental abnormalities. Congenital biliary cystic disease is characterized by dilation of portions of the biliary tree and associated fibrosis. Similar lesions are frequently found in the renal tubules as well. Although the pattern of lesions and inheritance in domestic animals is not as clearly separated as it is in man, the WSAVA Liver Study Group7 has proposed the following classification for congenital lesions of the biliary tree:1Congenital dilation of the large and segmental bile ducts (similar to Caroli disease)2Juvenile polycystic disease/congenital hepatic fibrosis3Adult polycystic disease (including von Meyenburg complexes)\n",

Consequently, it is also the most common site of toxic injury. Such injury often produces a characteristic distribution of acute coagulative necrosis within the hepatic lobule, most often centrilobular (Fig. 29-93\n). This pattern of toxin-induced injury is attributed to the higher content of cytochrome P450 enzymes in this area of the lobule. Hepatic metabolism of many molecules destined for excretion usually goes through a three step process that involves oxidation of the parent molecule, conjugation with a polar molecule (often glutathione), and transport across the canalicular membrane into the bile. Hepatocellular injury can arise when the initial oxidation step leads to an excess of the oxidized (or bioactive) parent molecule. This bioactive form can bind to cellular proteins, RNA, and cell membrane lipids, causing acute toxicity, and in other circumstances bind to DNA and lead to carcinogenicity. Many naturally occurring and therapeutic hepatotoxins (e.g., acetaminophen, xylitol, aflatoxin B1) produce centrilobular to massive necrosis, depending on the dose.21, 22, 23 Cats are particularly sensitive to hepatic toxins such as acetaminophen and this is likely because of less robust antioxidant defenses and hepatic drug conjugation pathways compared with the dog.24 Other types of toxins do not need hepatic metabolic activation and can cause injury directly, often producing random or periportal patterns of necrosis. However, drug- or chemical-induced acute necrosis in the periportal or midzone of the hepatic lobule is uncommon in dogs and cats.",

The degree and extent of necrosis can vary considerably from lobe to lobe and within lobes. Inflammation may be seen, but this is typically a nonspecific response to cell injury and death. The histologic appearance of acute toxic injury is heavily dependent on time, as a single insult can be nearly resolved in 3 to 4 days, depending on the severity of the initial insult. As a result, biopsies may fail to show significant lesions if the biopsy is obtained several days after a single exposure to a toxin, even though liver enzymes may still remain elevated. Centrilobular necrosis of the liver can also be caused by vascular disease, hypoxia, and some viruses, and must be distinguished from necrosis caused by toxins.",

Hepatocellular necrosis is not usually evident (Fig. 29-99\n). Neutrophils may predominate in a proportion of the portal areas in acute extrahepatic diseases.

Histologic examination is often needed to make a final determination. Histologically, hepatocellular adenomas are compressive masses composed of well-differentiated hepatocytes that form uniform plates up to two to three cells thick. Within the mass there is usually no more than a single portal tract (Fig. 29-101\n). Adenomatous hepatocytes tend to abut normal adjacent hepatocytes at right angles. Cystic areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or serum, as well as foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis can be present. Hepatocellular adenomas can be difficult to distinguish from hepatocellular nodular hyperplasia in biopsies because of similarity between the level of differentiation of the hepatocytes in both lesions. Unlike adenomas, nodular hyperplasia retains normal lobular architectural elements, although the portal tracts are more separated than normal. In small biopsies it is nearly impossible to distinguish regenerative nodules from hepatocellular adenomas, as many microscopic features are identical, such as the degree of differentiation of the hepatocytes and the paucity of portal tracts. However, regenerative nodules arise in a background of hepatocellular injury and are typically multiple so an appropriate clinical history can aid in the correct interpretation. Hepatocellular adenomas are most likely underdiagnosed and often confused with well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas because diagnostic criteria have been imprecise but the advent of newer criteria should clarify this issue.7\n",

Hepatocellular carcinomas are often solitary, frequently involve an entire lobe, and are well demarcated, although these tumors can also form multiple nodules within the liver via intrahepatic metastasis or possibly multiple sites of origin.43 Massive forms involving the entire liver can also occur.43 Areas of necrosis and hemorrhage are common. Histologically, malignant hepatocytes can form trabecular, pseudoglandular, or solid patterns. All three patterns can be found in a single neoplasm. Trabeculae are variably thick with three or more cells forming a trabecula and there may be prominent vascular spaces between the trabeculae (Fig. 29-102\n). In the pseudoglandular pattern neoplastic cells line a space that may contain eosinophilic fluid. Solid variants are composed of sheets of neoplastic hepatocytes (Fig. 29-103\n). Neoplastic hepatocytes can range from well-differentiated to highly anaplastic spindle cells. Pleomorphic and giant cells can occur. Bile plugs may be found in canaliculi. Metastasis to a variety of sites may occur, particularly to lymph nodes within the anterior abdomen, lungs, and seeding into the tissues of the peritoneal cavity.43, 44 Intrahepatic metastasis is also possible. The rate of metastasis of hepatocellular carcinomas is an area of considerable debate. Early references suggest a relatively high rate of metastasis (more than 60%),43 although most were reported to occur in the hepatic lymph node. Other reports indicated a rate of metastasis half of this level.44 More recent surveys are not available, but the conclusion of a consensus panel of veterinary hepatic pathologists was that metastasis of hepatocellular tumors to other organs was very uncommon. In the absence of metastasis, a clear indication of malignancy, the most useful criteria of malignancy are (a) invasion by malignant hepatocytes into local veins and through the interface between the tumor mass and the normal adjacent compressed normal hepatocytes; (b) prominent hepatocellular atypia, including pleomorphism, anisokaryosis, prominent nucleoli, and giant cells; and (c) increased mitotic index.",

It is important to ensure that a thorough postmortem examination is done, or when evaluating a biopsy, that the complete history is available to determine whether masses have been removed previously.",
