            "text": "Since the emergence and worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), published summaries have predominantly highlighted that children represent a small proportion (<2%) of COVID-19 cases, including hospitalizations and deaths. [1] [2] [3] Although children and young adults clearly are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, attention has focused primarily on their potential role in influencing spread and community transmission rather than the potential severity of infection in children and young adults themselves. Reanalyzed data from the epicenter of the Chinese outbreak noted that children represented 12% of infections. 4 To date, reports of severe disease in international pediatric populations have been limited, primarily descriptive, and in the United States, limited only to incomplete public health epidemiologic data. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Methods: This observational retrospective cohort study included 177 children and young adults with clinical symptoms and laboratory confirmed (177/1804; 9.8% of tested) SARS-CoV-2 infection treated between March 15 and April 30, 2020 at the Children's National Hospital, a large freestanding medical center located in Washington DC. These 177 patients came to medical attention for clinical evaluation of symptoms to our emergency departments, ambulatory clinics, inpatient units, or by referral for admission from external facilities. From these 177 infected patients, we identified cohorts of non-hospitalized (N=133) and hospitalized (N=44) patients. Of the 44 hospitalized patients, we identified cohorts of non-critically ill (N=35) and critically ill (N=9) patients. The objective of the study was to determine if specific epidemiologic and clinical patient characteristics were more likely to be associated with hospitalization and/or critical care. Data were extracted from medical records and recorded in a RedCap database, including age, sex, presence or absence of underlying medical condition and presence or absence of fever or respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath), as well as other symptoms (diarrhea/vomiting, myalgia, chest pain, loss of sense of taste or smell, headache). The Fisher exact test was performed to examine differences in the distribution of categorical variables between hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized patients, as well as between hospitalized critically ill patients vs. non-critically ill patients. Continuous variables were evaluated using logistic regression. This project was submitted to the IRB and was determined to be a Quality Improvement initiative and not human subjects research.",

Minor symptoms such as congestion/rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough and headache were also present more commonly in the non-hospitalized cohort. As has been the case in adult reports, fewer than half of the patients had both fever and respiratory symptoms present at the time of their diagnosis, but the majorities have one or the other. Our critically ill cohort includes a previously well child with the newly emerged hyper-inflammatory phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-associated KD-like shock syndrome that has been identified concurrently within the same time frame at other centers internationally. The pathogenesis of this phenotype is not yet fully characterized but it is important to recognize as yet another potential severe presentation in the pediatric population.",

It recently has been noted that introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to the Eastern United States most likely occurred as a result of importation of European strains, rather than Asian strains. Although no significant mutations conferring increased pathogenicity have yet been described, this is another potential difference that merits further analysis.",

One patient had features consistent with the recently emerged Kawasaki disease-like presentation with hyper-inflammatory state, hypotension and profound myocardial depression. Details regarding these critically-ill patients including the maximum respiratory support required are summarized in the Table 2 (available at www.jpeds.com). Co-infection: Sixty-three (63) of the first 105 (60%) SARS-CoV-2 infected patients underwent concomitant multiplex molecular testing for respiratory pathogens; of these, 59/63 (94%) had no evidence of co-infection. 4/63 (6%) had co-detection of routine coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or rhinovirus/enterovirus, , DC metropolitan region (Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Colombia) is in the midst of a steady increase of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the 6 weeks since March 15, 2020 In contrast to published and anecdotal reports from other countries and regions of the United States, our freestanding Children's Hospital has already evaluated and cared for a large number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2,including a significant number of children and young adults requiring hospitalization and critical care. This has occurred even prior to reaching the predicted peak surge of cases in our region at the time of this interim report. Twenty-five (25) percent of patients presenting to our hospital with symptoms required hospitalization and 5% required critical care, including need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, BiPAP and high-flow nasal cannula. No deaths have been reported to date, but critically ill patients remain hospitalized on mechanical ventilation at the time of this interim report.",
