Fueled by large\u2010scale genome sequencing projects, DNA microarray technology became the first application of this theory and has been widely used in gene expression profiling.2, 3, 4, 5, 6 However, biological functions are carried out primarily by proteins rather than nucleic acids. Furthermore, RNA expression levels do not always correlate with protein expression levels, and it is almost impossible to predict biochemical properties of a protein encoded by a given gene simply based on its expression profiles.7,8 Therefore, by focusing on studies of protein structures, functionalities, and protein\u2013protein interactions one can more directly characterize biological function of a given gene.",

First, the biochemical properties of proteins are far more diverse and complex than those of nucleic acids. Second, there is no ready method to amplify proteins for analysis, unlike PCR\u2010based amplification of nucleic acids. Third, many proteins are prone to denature or degrade in standard buffer conditions and at ambient temperature, making them substantially more challenging to study. Therefore, technology for systematically assaying protein function that is both high\u2010throughput and highly flexible is urgently needed. The past success of the DNA microarray technology highlights the power of a highly parallel, high\u2010throughput platform that allows profiling of thousands of molecular targets in a single experiment. By the same token, protein microarray technology is now emerging as a promising new tool that can push proteomic studies to a new level. In the past decade, many methodologies based on the protein microarray technology have been successfully developed and applied to proteomic studies, including protein identification, quantification, and functional analysis of signaling pathways and networks, as well as clinical diagnostics and antibody characterizations.",

Depending on their applications, protein microarrays can be classified into two types: the analytical and functional protein microarrays. Analytical protein microarrays are usually composed of well\u2010characterized biomolecules with specific binding activities, such as antibodies, to analyze the components of complex biological samples (e.g., serum and cell lysates) or to determine whether a sample contains a specific protein of interest. They have been used for protein expression profiling, biomarker identification, cell surface marker/glycosylation profiling, clinical diagnosis, and environmental/food safety analysis. On the other hand, functional protein microarrays are constructed by printing a large number of individually purified proteins, and are mainly used to comprehensively query biochemistry properties and activities of those immobilized proteins. In principle, it is feasible to print arrays comprised of virtually all annotated proteins of a given organism, effectively comprising a whole proteome microarray. Functional protein microarrays have been successfully applied to identify protein\u2013protein, protein\u2013lipid, protein\u2013antibody, protein\u2013small molecules, protein\u2013DNA, protein\u2013RNA, lectin\u2013glycan, and lectin\u2013cell interactions, and to identify substrates or enzymes in phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and nitrosylation, as well as to profile immune response.

For instance, Zhu et al. utilized soft lithography to generate nanowells on a polydimethylsiloxane sheet placed on top of microscope slides.15 These nanowell chips were used to immobilize substrate proteins to profile phosphorylation specificity of 119 kinases encoded by budding yeast. The open structure of nanowells provides physical barriers and allows for sequential adding of different buffers, which is critical for multistep experiments. The main disadvantage of this method is the requirement of specialized equipment needed to load nanowells at high density.",

The purification protocol took advantage of both a 96\u2010well format and immobilized affinity chromatography. This strategy allowed parallel purification of unprecedented numbers of proteins\u2014up to 1152 per day. The success of this approach is built upon several unique aspects: First, it utilizes a eukaryotic expression system that both generates high levels of recombinant proteins and tends to produce a high fraction of soluble proteins. Compared with bacterial expression systems, in which a large fraction of recombinant proteins end up in inclusion bodies, this is a huge advantage when a large number of eukaryotic proteins are being generated. Second, the expression of recombinant proteins is only induced over about two total cell cycles, which greatly reduces toxicity and cell death. Third, a foreign eukaryotic protein purified from yeast is more likely to be active because post\u2010translational modifications (PTMs) necessary for function are more likely to occur correctly than in either bacteria or a cell\u2010free system. Forth, the use of an N\u2010terminal GST tag helps protein fold correctly and therefore, improve its stability and solubility. Other commonly used tags include the so\u2010called tandem affinity purification (TAP\u2010tag), maltose binding protein (MBP), and 6xHis, to name a few. In fact, the same group later went on to build a TAP\u2010tagged yeast ORF collection and purified >5000 yeast proteins.19\n",

To explore alternative approaches, several groups have attempted to test the in vitro transcription/translation systems, such as the E. coli, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocyte systems. In these systems, proteins can be expressed directly from cDNA templates,25 which can be obtained through PCR amplification without the lengthy and costly process of subcloning. For example, the E. coli cell\u2010free protein expression system has been used to synthesize proteins in a 96\u2010well format,26 and the improved wheat germ cell\u2010free protein synthesis system has been applied to the in vitro expression of 13,364 human proteins.27 Furthermore, these systems can significantly decrease the reaction volume required for generation of recombinant proteins,28 which is also one of the advantages because the cost of in vitro expression system is rather high.",

Recently, NAPPA has been successfully expanded to high\u2010density arrays of 1000 different proteins.31 In addition, Tao et al. developed a different method in which ribosomes are installed at the end of an RNA template to allow for the capture of the nascent polypeptides by a puromycin moiety that is grafted at one end of an oligonucleotide immobilized on a solid surface.32\n",

Adapted from DNA microarray fabrication, the robotic contact printing tool is the most suitable for producing protein microarrays of high content due to the requirement to array large numbers of different proteins. Metal pins with solid or quill tips are used in contact printers to deliver subnanoliter of protein samples to the slide surface. Quill pins, which have a larger sample capacity, can print hundreds of spots continuously after each sample loading. The printed spots are typically circular and the size depends largely on the pin tip dimension, surface chemistry, and the printing buffer. A significant advantage of this type of microarrayers is their speed and throughput\u2014up to 48 pins can be loaded and more than 200 slides printed at a time. However, the pins are very fragile and expensive, and the pin tips may damage the slide surface, especially complex 3D substrates (e.g., nitrocellulose\u2010coated slides). Furthermore, some proteins are sticky to metal and the general washing steps may not clean them completely from the pins, and thus give rise to cross\u2010contamination of protein samples and carry\u2010over problem.",

However, such instruments usually suffer from longer printing time and fewer pins, which is a significant drawback when printing a large number of protein samples. Moreover, noncontact printers can sometimes misplace spots and/or generate satellite spots, resulting in a high failure rate.38 An additional disadvantage of noncontact printers is that they usually require a larger sample volume, which is challenging and expensive for high\u2010throughput protein production.",

Surface plasmon resonance is a label\u2010free technology to analyze biomolecular interactions in real\u2010time, and has been adapted for protein microarray signal detection.56,57 Based on the principle that incident light can resonate with plasma on a metal surface in total internal reflection, the resonance signals will change when ligands bind to (and dissociate from) ligands on the array surface. Binding event can thus be monitored and the kinetic parameters calculated in real\u2010time. Mass spectrometry has also been used for detecting ligands bound to individual proteins printed on protein microarrays, with such approaches as MALDI\u2010MS, SELDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS, and MALDI\u2010TOF\u2010MS used for this purpose.58, 59, 60 The analysis is rapid and simple, requires small sample amount, and can be used for direct detection of analytes bound from complex samples, such as urine, serum, plasma, and cell lysates. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) uses surface topological changes to identify the analytes bound on the array.61,62 More specifically, AFM detects the increase in height of the proteins/antibodies on the array, and thus is able to measure binding interactions.",
