The newly identified virus was named HPIV3/China/BCH01/2016, and the genome sequence was deposited in GenBank under accession number KY234287. Interestingly, alignment of the sequence of the surface haemagglutinin\u2010neuraminidase (HN) gene of this strain with other HPIV3 HN gene sequences from isolates from seven countries (United States of America, Australia, India, Japan, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and China) in GenBank revealed a 32\u2010bp insertion in the HPIV3/China/BCH01/2016 strain. This insertion leads to an advanced stop codon at residue 58 in the haemagglutinin\u2010neuraminidase glycoprotein and has not been reported previously (Figure 2B). The presence of this insertion was further confirmed by PCR and direct Sanger sequencing. The influence of this insertion on the function of the HN protein and pathogenicity of the HPIV3 virus is unclear, and we are currently attempting to isolate this strain using human airway epithelial cell culture. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HPIV3/China/BCH01/2016 strain belongs to Cluster C. Compared with Clusters A and B, which were isolated in the middle of the last century, most strains in Cluster C were isolated recently in Asia. The Cluster C isolates were further grouped into four sub\u2010clusters (C1, C2, C3, and C4). HPIV3/China/BCH01/2016 strain belongs to the C3 group together with previously reported isolates from Beijing, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Gansu provinces of China and one isolate from Japan (Figure 2C). Because the primers used in the Luminex assays were patented, we could only deduced that the primers used for HPIV3 virus detection in the Luminex assay were annealing around the insertion area, leading to a negative result.",

The results suggested that there might be no direct link between the two and that children might be an important reservoir of TTVs.8 SEN virus (SENV) was first discovered in the serum of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101) infected patient.

For human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1), because no more than 12 reads were detected and genome coverage of HIV were less than 1% for each four samples, one reasonable explanation was that the HIV related reads were due to contamination of the reagents used in sample process step, as murine leukemia virus (MLV) is commonly found in reverse transcriptase, and its shared extremely high homology with HIV in partial genome.",

However, the nasopharyngeal aspirates collected are likely to contain virus which mainly replicate in the upper respiratory tract. The mucosa may also contain temporary microorganisms that are not part of the normal microflora. They may come from the environment, for example, from dust and from food and water. It is likely that a proportion of the sequences came from such microorganisms. Viral metagenomics clearly provides a crucial tool for virus discovery. With this approach, not priori information is needed, in contrast to directed PCR or Luminex assays, and viruses that are difficult to propagate in cell culture can be discovered. In this study, we detected a novel HPIV3 strain with a 32\u2010bp insertion in the HN gene, highlighting the strength of the method to identify not only novel viruses but also viruses likely to be missed by ordinary clinical tests. Lysholm et al5 also identified one novel type of Rhinovirus C and a number of previously undescribed viral genetic fragments of unknown origin using a metagenomic sequencing strategy. Using the high\u2010throughput capacity of ultra\u2010deep sequencing, Yang et al7 detected a co\u2010infected case of HEV with HRV that was missed by regular PCR testing.
