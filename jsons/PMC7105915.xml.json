In practice, 100% (exponential) amplification efficiency may occur for only part of a PCR.4 In the initial cycles, efficiency depends on the ease with which the primers, in a background of human genomic DNA sequences (that may have partial homology with the primers), find and hybridize with their specific target. Thereafter, exponential amplification may occur until limited by saturation events: PCR products outnumber the available thermostable polymerase and/or primers; these reagents are then insufficient to support amplification of each PCR amplicon previously synthesized. Experiments are required to optimize and standardize the efficiency of a given PCR assay. False-negative data may result from sub-optimally designed PCR tests.

The TaqMan probe is labelled with a fluorescent reporter dye (e.g. FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein)) at the 5\u2032-end and at the 3\u2032-end with a fluorescent quencher dye (e.g. TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)). During the annealing step of a PCR cycle, the TaqMan probe hybridizes to its target; FAM fluorescence emission is suppressed despite excitation due to the proximity with TAMRA. During the extension step, Taq DNA polymerase begins synthesizing DNA from the primer upstream of the probe binding site. Taq DNA polymerase possesses a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease activity, which cleaves FAM from the probe and also degrades the probe as extension proceeds.

The ARMS technique exploits this biology for the detection of point mutations, SNPs or base insertions/deletions.4, 17 In its simplest form, the technique requires three primers: one primer (CP) is common to alternative forms of a given allele; a second primer (P2) is designed so that the 3\u2032-end matches a defining base specific to one allele form; and a third primer (P3) is specific at the 3\u2032-end to the alternative allele. Two separate PCRs are performed, one with primer pair CP/P2, and one with primer pair CP/P3. (If the common primer is a \u2018forward\u2019 primer, the second and third primers are \u2018reverse\u2019 primers and vice versa.)

Using this approach, it is possible to tell if a patient is homozygous or heterozygous for a given allele form: a homozygous patient will only yield one amplicon, CP/P2 or CP/P3 depending on the allele present, whereas a heterozygous patient will yield amplicons with the CP/P2 and CP/P3 combinations.

            "text": "Identity testing is most commonly performed by multiplex PCR for microsatellite repeat units. PCR is performed using primers that flank the microsatellite repeat region (and also include unique genomic sequences). The microsatellite units are repeated a variable number of times at a given chromosomal locus. Many of these microsatellites are highly polymorphic with respect to the number of repeats at a given allele and are also highly heterozygotic within the population. Analysis of the number of repeats and the extent of population heterozygosity allows calculation of the probability of matched microsatellite amplicons from different individuals. Typically, a minimum of four and up to 12 microsatellite loci are screened in PCR identity tests. For example, the GammaSTR\u00ae Quadriplex assay (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) amplifies four microsatellite-containing loci (Figure 9\n); the probability that two Caucasian individuals will have matching amplicons at all four loci is 1 in 16,790. (If an additional eight loci are added, the matching probability is 1 in 3.03 \u00d7 1011.) In pathology practice, microsatellite PCR is useful in resolving issues of questionable specimen identity (Figure 9). Microsatellite PCR analysis is also performed for paternity testing and for monitoring the establishment of donor bone marrow tissues in a recipient.10, 11, 12, 18, 19\n",
