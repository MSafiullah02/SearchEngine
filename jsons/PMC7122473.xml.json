Pharmacokinetics is the study of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs. Clinical pharmacokinetics applies the data gathered in these studies to design optimal dosing and minimize adverse reactions for optimal therapeutic outcomes. In general, for drugs to reach their target organs (distribution), they first need to enter into the system circulation. Drugs given orally, intramuscularly, or by transdermal patch need to be absorbed through several physiological barriers before reaching the systemic circulation. Drugs are metabolized by specific enzymes (many by the cytochrome P450 oxidases in the liver) into other metabolites that may or may not have the same pharmacological effect as the parent drug.",

The aqueous humor is a clear fluid that flows through the anterior segment of the eye that provides nutrients and drugs to other nonvascular eye tissues. After use, many eye drugs exit the eye, enter the blood stream, and are transported to the liver where they are metabolized. The drug metabolites or the drugs themselves are then excreted from the body either through urine or feces. However, it is important to note that pathological conditions, genetic polymorphism, and drug\u2013drug interaction may influence the pharmacokinetics of drugs.",

Clinically, pharmacodynamics is the correlation between the dosage of a drug that is administered to a patient and the pharmacological response of the drug. It is important to note that there may not be a correlation between increases in dosages and pharmacological effects. One important reason is that the pharmacological effects of drugs are achieved through drug/receptor interactions. Drugs bind to their respective receptors, form a complex, and elicit their physiological effects. At base level, almost all receptors are available for the drugs to bind. As concentrations of drugs are increased, there are less available receptors with which to bind; therefore, the effects of the drugs may not change as drug/receptors reach saturation.",

For example, in Fig. 1, drug A and drug B have the same efficacy, but greater than drug C. ED50 is the concentration of drug where there is a half-maximal effect in vivo, EC50 is the concentration of drug where there is half-maximal effect in vitro, and Kd is the concentration at which half-maximal binding of drugs to receptors occurs. In addition, depending on if studies for drugs and receptors are carried out in vitro or in vivo, the curves are called concentration\u2013response curves or dose\u2013response curves, respectively.\n",

A partial agonist in the presence of a full agonist can also be considered an antagonist. An inverse agonist is a phenomenon where a drug produces an opposite effect of that produced by an agonist (drug D on Fig. 2). Antagonist have no efficacy (drug C on Fig. 2) on a receptor and act either by blocking the direct binding site of an agonist (direct antagonist) or by binding to an indirect binding site, and changing the conformation of the receptor into its inactive state so that an agonist cannot bind to the receptor (Fig. 3). A direct antagonist can be overpowered by increasing the concentration of an agonist and would cause a shift of the dose\u2013response curve to the right; on the other hand, an indirect antagonist in the presence of an agonist cannot be overcome by increasing the concentration of the agonist.\n\n",

These agents include the first-line agent prostaglandins, beta-blockers (timolol), selective alpha-adrenergic agonist (brimonidine), and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, like brinzolamide. Prostaglandins are considered first line for the treatment of glaucoma because they are the most potent topical agent that can be used to lower IOP, meaning that it takes less drug to get a desired therapeutic effect. If looking at the dose\u2013response curves in Fig. 1, the prostaglandin agents would be drug A, while the other IOP lowering drugs would have their dose\u2013response curves shifted to the right.",

They are also known as Cys-loop receptors for the homologous extracellular loop that is flanked by two cysteine residues connected by a disulfide bridge. These receptors allow the movement of both cations and anions, which determines if the receptors are excitatory or inhibitory, respectively (Calimet et al. 2013). The excitatory LGICs consist of the serotonin, nicotinic acetylcholine, and zinc-activated ion channel, while the inhibitory receptors are the GABA and glycine receptors (daCosta and Baenziger 2013; Lemoine et al. 2012). The pentameric receptor\u2019s subunits have both the amino- and carboxyl-terminus on the extracellular region. These receptors include four transmembrane segments where the second membrane segment of each subunit associates with all five subunit second membranes to form a pore (Lemoine et al. 2012).",

The result of the ligand binding to the receptor causes a receptor conformational change therefore opening up the channel to allow ions to flow through. The speed of the cellular signal transduction occurs within milliseconds. There are no secondary messenger biochemical systems involved with LGICs. However, the influx of Ca2+ is important where it can act as a secondary messenger, activating many calcium-binding proteins, thus further amplifying intracellular signals and producing a signal transduction cascade which could influence gene expression and changes in cell physiology (Akopian and Witkovsky 2002; Pankratov and Lalo 2014).",

Many small organic molecules are able to bind to within the transmembrane segments; however, larger ligands such as protein normally bind to the extracellular amino-terminus or the extracellular loops between the transmembrane segments (Kobilka 2007). Binding of a ligand to the receptor results in a conformational change; this causes the receptor to act as guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The plasma membrane resident heterotrimeric G proteins (G\u03b1, G\u03b2, G\u03b3) are recruited then to the GPCR, promoting an exchange of a GDP for a GTP on the alpha subunit resulting in the dissociation of the G\u03b1 subunit from the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit protein. The \u03b1 subunit and the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit mediate other proteins as second messengers of GPCRs to transduce cellular signaling further downstream. The inherent GTPase activity of the G\u03b1 subunit causes hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, resulting in the termination of the G protein and reuniting of the \u03b1 subunit to the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit (Johnston and Siderovski 2007).",

An example of RTKs being a target for ocular pharmacology are the vascular endothelin growth factor (VEGF) receptor, where overstimulation of the receptor signals for the formation of abnormal blood vessel growth observed in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic macular edema (Davuluri et al. 2009; Triantafylla et al. 2014; Witmer et al. 2002). Cytokine receptors do not have kinase enzymatic activity itself and therefore need the use of intracellular tyrosine kinases such as JAK to phosphorylate the receptor itself as well as other proteins (Patel et al. 2013). GCs are similar to RTKs and are part of the G protein-signaling cascade where they synthesize cyclic GMP from GTP (Gileadi 2014).

These receptors are not embedded in the plasma membrane of cells but found in the cytoplasm or within the nucleus. Ligands for nuclear receptors need to be lipid soluble to allow the ligands to pass through the plasma membrane freely where it binds to the receptor. The receptor then translocates to DNA, binding to a regulatory region near the promoter called a hormone response element, acting as a transcription factor. Co-activator and corepressor factors are then recruited mediating gene transcription. The activation of nuclear receptors is important for the regulation of metabolism, development, and homeostasis (Bain et al. 2007). These receptors can regulate many genes at once, for instance, glucocorticoid receptor has over 1000 genomic binding sites regulating the transcription of numerous genes (Polman et al. 2012).

ENaC is characterized by a conductance of 5 pS at physiological sodium concentrations and a half-saturation of ion conductance at 70 mM sodium and is selective for sodium over potassium. ENaC is constitutively active at the plasma membrane and changes between open and closed conformations with an average open probability of ~0.5.",

Prostaglandins are ubiquitous, and the types produced in a given cell are dependent on the expression profile of the prostaglandin synthetic enzymes in that particular cell. Prostaglandins are autocrine or juxtacrine modulators that have diverse pharmacological effects on the central nervous system and the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and visual systems. Additionally, prostaglandins have been associated with diseases such as cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase in the clinical treatment of inflammatory diseases and the use of prostaglandin analogs in the treatment of glaucoma underscore the physiological importance of prostaglandins.",

While there are five identified members of the VEGF family, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth factor (PlGF), alternative splicing of corresponding mRNAs results in many isoforms of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PlGF. VEGF receptors include three protein tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3, and two nonenzymatic receptors, neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2, localized to vascular endothelial cells. These specialized localization and distribution of VEGFRs allow for the selectivity and specificity of VEGF\u2019s actions. VEGFR-1 binds to VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and PIGF with high affinity, while VEGFR-2 binds with lower affinity to some isoforms of VEGF-A and higher affinity to VEGF-C and VEGF-D; however, binding results in different biological effects. VEGF plays a fundamental role in the process of neovascularization in normal physiological processes as VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 null mice failed to form organized blood vessels which resulted in death between embryonic days 7\u20139 (Dumont et al. 1998; Fong et al. 1995; Hiratsuka et al. 1998; Shalaby et al. 1995).",

AMD involves losses of cone photoreceptor cells in the macular region of the retina and results in blurred vision and eventually loss of central vision. Two types of AMD have been characterized, non-neovascular AMD (dry) and neovascular AMD (wet AMD). Aberrant VEGF expression has been associated with the pathophysiology of neovascular AMD (Kvanta et al. 1996) and results in abnormal growth of new blood vessels with structural defects that may lead to seepage of vascular contents and bleeding, thus leading to damages to the delicate macula. Of the two types of AMD, drug treatment options for neovascular AMD involve antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. This therapy is aimed at reducing the amounts of VEGF that is secreted in the eye, particularly the choroid layer of the eye.",

Target tissues are the ciliary processes (Potter and Rowland 1978) which contain \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors and the retina (Elena et al. 1987; Ferrari-Dileo 1988). Activation of \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist decreases IOP by decreasing aqueous humor secretion in ciliary processes and decreasing the flow of aqueous humor. Both betaxolol HCl and timolol are neuroprotective in glaucoma animal models. While \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist is also involved in blood flow to the optic nerve head, it is not clear if its regulation of vascular tone is protective. Timolol, nonselective \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptor antagonists, protects RGCs in rat glaucoma model. The signaling pathways by which \u03b2-blockers achieve their effects involve inhibition of adenylate cyclase and decreased cAMP in ciliary processes (Crider and Sharif 2002). In the retina inhibition of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors may involve regulation of calcium and sodium channels, NMDA receptors, and BDNF regulation.",

NO could be neuroprotective or degenerative, depending on the concentrations in the tissue. In ciliary processes cholinergic stimulation regulates nitric oxide synthase activity (Ellis et al. 2001). In Schlemm\u2019s canal, shear stress causes increases in NO (Ashpole et al. 2014) which binds to soluble guanylate cyclase and activates the enzyme. In trabecular meshwork and Schlemm\u2019s canal, activation of soluble guanylate cyclase results in increased cGMP levels and activation of protein kinase G. The high conductance calcium-activated potassium channel is regulated by protein kinase G, and this regulation results in changes in cell volume and or cell contractility (Dismuke et al. 2008).",
