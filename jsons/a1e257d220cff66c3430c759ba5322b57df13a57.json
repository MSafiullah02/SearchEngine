Appropriate tests can identify autoreactive T cells and antibodies preceding t!ie onset of c!inica! disease in, for example, IDDM (1-4).

Sarvetnick -Vinjsei, lost respionses. and autoimmunity cics in the immune response occur outside of rhe affected tissue. In IDDM, pancreatic p cells and their auiigens are the targets of destruction; in MS, the myelin sheath produced by oligodendrocytcs ol the CNS is affected, and in rhettmatoid arthritis, collagen is attacked as a self-antigcii present iu the syuovial membranes of joints. Many autoiminune diseases are mtiltifactorial with associations t(3 both genetic and environmental factors. Although strong evidence links some autoimmune diseases vvidi inherited genes, including those ofthe major histo-conipatibiliLy complex (MHC) (5, 6), theparciLipation of enviroiinieiital influences (7, 8) has been well documeuted, Iu fact, viral infections often precede both the onset ofdiabetes (9-14) aud relapses t>f MS (15-17), In experimental animals, virtises can actually cause diabetes (14, 18, 19) as well as demyelination like that iu MS (20, 21), Understanding the etiology of autoimmune diseases thoroughly enough to account for the complexity of such multifactorial processes is difficult. To simplify aud group the many components associated with the progression of tiiese diseases, we can separate their onset into three sequential steps. First, a repertoire of immuue cells with the capacity for autoreactivity is estabhshed. Appropriate MHC and T-cell receptor (TCR) alleles must be available both to present and to recognize self-antigens, thereby generating au autoreactive response. For example, susceptibility to diabetes is inherited by biimaus via MHC allek^s like HLA DQ8 or by noii-obese diabetic (NOD) mice through I-A g7, but the presence of these alleles alone does not lead to disease. Therefore, an cuvironmeutal event like infection is apt lo be a contributory factor. Second, pocencially autoreactive T cells must be activatt^d. Target tissue inflammation, possibly   through viral infection, is the most likely mediator for T-cell activation. An initial, localiztid iufection would not only serve to release sequestered antigens that stimtilate autoreactive cells, but would also create a high local concentracion of cytokines aild chemokines that would further attract immune cells to the organ. Once an infection is neutralized (i,e, viral clearance), a chronic respouse to the target tissue by these newly activated autoreactive lympliocytes could remain. Third, a faihire of the Immune system to counter-regulate the autoreactive response would result in further chronicity. Without proper regulation, an excess of activated lymphocytes would remain after che infeccion had dissipaced, rcsulcing iu a breakdown of colerance to specific self-antigens. The lack of effective regulation could be gcuecically determined so that tbe individual's immune response is otU of control. A similarly plausible scenario is that a sufficiently strong iuflammatory resp(jnse could activate an equally strong auCoreacCive T-cell populaCion for which normal lymphocyte counter-regulation would be itisufTicient, Inflammation as an autoimmune process Infccticnis and iuflammatory processes can elicit cytokiue and/or chemokine release, immune cell infiltration, and tissue destruction, as well as release and presentation of both foreign and self-an tig ens. Consequently, self-reactive lymphocytes arc activated. Normal immune regulation mitiimizes the impact of tiiese autoreactive T cells by limiting their migratory capability and hfespan after infection. Logically, chen, defects in this regulatory process lead to autoimmuue disease as is the case in the lpr/lpr mouse, which develops a lupus-like syndrotiie (22).",

The expression of both Thl and Th2 cytokiues like interferon (IFN)-y, ttuiior necrosis factor (TNF)-a, iuterleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-p in the pancreata of transgenic mice incite autoimmune diabetes (28-33) but, conversely, IL-4, IL-6 and TGF-p stippress spontaneous diahetes in NOD mice (34-36), Similarly, transgenic expression of IFN-yand TNF-a iu the CNS (37, 38) leads to the dtivckDpmcut of demyeliuacing disease and, in the case of IFN-y, enhances disease after EAE induction (39), Therefore, increased local cycokine levels that tnimic and Induce organ-specific inflammation can result in tissue damage and release of tissuespecific self-antigetis that xiltimately activate autoreaccive lymphocytes.

However, after LCMV infection of the mice, viruses were cleared by a vigorous cellular immune response tbat subsequently led to an attack on p cells and resulted in diabetes (73, 74) , This sequence of events was not limited to the pancreas, because other transgenic mice were eventually generated whose CNS specifically expressed LCMV and, after infection by that virus, developed a disease similar to MS (75).

Repeated virai infections from distinct viruses with no known cross-reactivity liave been shown to cross-activate memory lymphocytes from cariicr infectious (92, 93) More specifically, this activation of CD8' T cells hy IFN was induced by IL-1 5 and appeared to utilize the IL-2 receptor (5 that is found on CD8-T celis but not CD4+ T cells (106), Tiierefore, this CD8\"-seiected reactivation makes sense and is appropriate considering that, after virai intrusion, the cyt(jiytic arm of the immune response is generaiiy the most critical in clearing the infectiou. Therefore non-specific cross-activation may participate only when CDS' T cells and their epitopes are involved in disease development. However, in the coxsackie-induced IDDM of BDG2,5 cransgeuic mice (89), in HSV-1-induced HSK (40), and iu pachogen-induced EAE (103), chc accivacion of pathogenic CD4' lymphocytes was essential for disease inducciou, and targeC tissue breakdown vi'as required. In systems dependent on CD8\"^ lymphocytes, snch as the LCMV crausgenic models previously described, systemic cross-activation may be the <Diily reqtiiremenC to activate memory CD8' T cells and induce ciieir pacliogciiic accs that produce disease.

The simplest explanation, since inflammation and access to the target tissue arc both required, is release of sequestered ancigens during che inflammaCory process. These ancigens would certainly reactivate both CD4' and CD8-^ lymphocytes and leave a population of autoreactive lymphocytes that recognizes a numher of autoantigens, as is observed in human autoimmune disease. One could hypothesize chat memory lymphocyces could reaccivacc ciirough inolccuiar mimicry; however, the induction of cimlcal disease would require a significanC increase in the cocai number of these specific seif-reaccivc lymphocytes, as Oidstone has described (49, 77, 78, 107) , Considering the number of specific lymphocytes required, the viral epitope would need to cross-reacc with a self-epitope ofa suitably high affinity and would most likeiy have to be the predominant epitope for virai clearance. Additionally, chis cross-reactivation alone would undoubtedly be iustifficieut to cause disease without target tissue inflammation.",

Viral initiation of organ-specific autoimmunity The strength of the epigenetic hypothesis is that viruses and other pathogens can act at all three stages of disease induction. By breaking down host tissues or mimicking host antigens, viruses can establish an autoreactive immune response. Infections of specific tissue can lead to the activation, amplification, and recruitment of autorcaclive lymphocytes, A strong, virally induced immune response can then overwhelm local counterregulatory mechauisms.

One of the strongest associations between this form of immunity and disease is the example of bacterial streptococcal M protein cross-reacting with myocardial tissue antigens in the oligodendrocyte protein, transaldolase, has molecular similarity to human T-cell lctikcmia virtis-1 Gag (55), The CB3 and CB4 strains of coxsackie virus have small regions of amino acids that resemble those in the myocardium or the pancreatic islet autigcii, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), respectively, and infection with these viruses is ass(jciated with the clinical onset of myocarditis (57-59) or IDDM (13), respeccively, in mouse and man. Particularly interesting is tht: association between coxsackie viruses and IDDM, Epidemiological studies have shown that coxsackie viral infecti(5u is a frequent event iu patients who ultimately suffer from IDDM (2, 14, 60-64), In patients and NOD mice with IDDM, auioreactive responses to islet antigens like GAD and heat shock pr(5teiu 60 are observed preceding the clinical onset of disease (2, 3, 65, 66), Suppression of the autoimmune response in NOD mice following the injection ol GAD intrathymically or intravenously in 3-week-old mice was successful in delaying and/or preventing the onset of disease (67-69), These results further tmderscore the important link between tolerance to GAD and susceptibility to IDDM, Moreover, the identification ofa six-amino-acid stretch of similarity between coxsackie virtis CB4 P2C protein and GAD generated support for the mimicry hypothesis as the mechanisin by which c(Dxsackic virus infection might initiate IDDM in susceptible individuals (3,4), Immunization with peptides from both GAD and CB4 P2C protein in mice also demonstrated that both peptides could generate cross-reactive T-cell responses (70-72); however, tiiese responses were restricted to the NOD MHC allele. Additionally, in patients with IDDM, the predominantly recognized determinant contains the cross-rcactivc CAD sequence (3), The ability of coxsackie virus to infect the pancreas and Inflict a strong, local inflammatory response ftirthcr complicates chc discincciou between possible causes for the related diabetes; either the virally induced cross-reactivity or the induced iiifiammatory processes.

Self-reactive immuue cells arc, thus, stimulated as part of the bystander response. Ordinarily this aberrant response can be controlled, but iu the susceptible individual, imintme dysregulation may allow these autoreactive cells to persist. By virtue of iniecting a specific organ, a virtis can elicit an autoimmune respouse resulting in clinical manifestacions well after viral clearance. of disease(89), The first of these strains were the NOD mice, which carr)-the NOD MHC allele to vvliich presentation of thr cross-reactive epicope is restricted; tiiese mice develop spontaneous IDDM by 1 6 to 20 wci.-'ks of age. The CB4i.Dfected NOD mice showed no enhancement or change in the onset tir progression ofdiabetes, Additiojially, no proliferation to cither ofthe cross-reactive epitopes was observed. Therefore,the predominant immune response to the virus following siich infection is most likely to other viral epitopes. The second strain tested, BlO,H2g7 mice, carry the restricted MHC allele but lack many other susceptibility factors and do iun develop sponlaneons IDDM; again, tiiese mice did not develop diabetes or insulitis after nifection. Tiie lack of deveiopment ofdiabetes or even proliferative responses to the cross-reactive epitopes in these mice scrongly suggests that similar determinants are not involved in the rcs[K\")[ise to coxsackie viral infeccion. Indeed, they may not be processed and presented at all. However, infection ofthe third experimental strain, BDC2,5 transgenic mice, which harbor a transgene euc(.)ding a diabetogenic TCR specific to an islet granule antigen that is distinct from GAD65 and does not cross-react with CB4, resulted in rapid onset of diabetes within 2 to 4 weeks of infection in two-thirds ofthe mice. Yet, tiiese BDC2.5 mice do not otherwise develop spontaneous diabetes. Coxsackie virus infection of the BDC2,5 mice activated the resting islet-specific memory lymphocyte population, and this was mcasuraiile by increased cell surface expression of CD25 and CD44 molecules on the transgenic Vp4\"' lymphocytes. Thus, infection and inflammation ofthe pancreas led to the activation of a significant pt>pulation of isiet-speciflc memory T lymphocytes through a bystander mechanism and resulted in clinical disease. The rapid nature of chc induced diabetes is consistent with the idea tiiat the responding T cells in tiie pancreas were resting memory iympliocytcs prior to activation by CB4 infection. Indeed, a primary response may not stimulate sufficient numbers of autoreactive lympiiocytes, whereas reactivation of memory autoreactive T cells can generate a sufficiently intense response to produce clinical disease, Whtjcher tbese memory cells were reactivated by release of sequestered antigen from the damaged tissue or simpiy by cytokine induction from tbe systemic immune response to the virus remained in question. -viral response, it is agreed that a small yet substantial popuiation of non-viral specific iympliocytes arc activated. Viral expansicHi of non-specific T-cell rt'spoiiscs can be mimicked b)-tile injection of IFN-a or poly 1;C (96). Therefore, we performed additiojial experiiTients to dissect tiic rc'C]t!irernents tor IDDM induction by intbcting BDC2,5 niicc with LC;MV Yet, LCMV infection did not indtice diai)ctcs, nor was therr an observable increase in insulitis, Immunostaining of peripherai blood iymphocytes before and after infection of tiiese BDC2,5 mice demonstrated preferential activation ofthe non-V,i4 (nii]itransgenic) popuiation of CD4' iymphocytes, \\isihlc as increases in CD44 and CD2 5 staining, williotu tlu-acti\\-ati<)n of the V;j4' (transgenic) poptilation. During acute iniection, LCMV rarely infects tbe islets, and no pancreatic tissue destruction was observed. Additionally, as expected, treatment of BDC2,5 mice with poly I:C did not induce diabetes (M, S, Horwitz, N, Sarvetnick, in preparation), Sitiiilarly, in work done with transgeuic mice expressing an enccpiiaiitogenic TCR, disease was induced on!)' after breakdown of the target tissiic to allow entry of lymphocytes (97), wiiich suggests a role for the pathogen iTi tisstie damage and disease indnction. This outcome further argues for the conclusion that release of sequestered antigen, not induction by cytokines from the systemic immune response, is responsible ftir reactivation ofthe resting anti-islet lymphocyte popuiation and drvolopiueni of IDDM, The ability of coxsackie virus to elicit IDDM in BD{'2,5 TCR transgenic mice bttt not in NOD mice denioustratcs that the mechanism was bystander damage aud activation of T cells, and not an autoreacCive response to GAD induced chrough molecular mimicry Furthermore, the dialietic state in tbese niice steuuiied from tbe pancreatic iropism of the CB4 viral strain and its capacity to direct tissue damage. Although the ability of viruses to activate T-cell responses nonspecifically has been well documented (90, 92, 93), thf role of this bystander ampiifled set of lymphocytes in autoimmune disease has been the subject of some debate, Tf, as suggested, chcsc nt:wly activated responses cannot act in vivo lo cause disease (98, 99), how has non-spccifk, cr<iss-activaii<)n of tympiiocytes yielded pathologic evcuts iu two distinct models of virus-induced demyelinating disease (25, 75), Etjiiowing coxsackie viral infection, non-specific reactivation of autoreactive lymphocytes resulted in diabetes, Tiiis sequence suggests a oniy the importance of breakdown and reiease of sequestered antigen in tissue that ultimately hecomes the target for autoimmune disease but aiso the requireinenc for a prec'xiscing memory population of autoreactive lymphocytes. Recent experiments on HSK, an autoimmune disease ofthe eye triggered by HSV-1, re-emphasize chc complex events that enable a virus to inflict tissue-specific damage aud also share aiitigcuic simiiarity, Zhao et ai. (1 00) used mutational analysis ofthe virus to demonstrate a requirement for the cross-reactive epicope in HSV-1 to induce HSK, However, in sharp contrast, Gangappa cc al, (40) found chat HSK could occur in mice iucapable of generating a cross-reactive response to HSV-I. How can such coufliccing results be reconciled? The tropism and rephcacion of clie virns itself may poiiiC Co chc answer, Repiication of the virus in the eye can resulc in cissue damage and recruicmenc of iymphocyCes that are ultimately reqtiired to induce disease. Mutacional aiceracioiis in that virus would direccly deter repiication of that virus in tbe eye and, chereby, reduce its ability to induce disease. The apparent cross-reactive response may simply serve to amplify the disease process. Is there a role for molecular mimicry in the development <Df autoimmune disease? Studies of large panels of monoclonal antibodies (>600) generated against viruses (45, 49, 101, iO2) have measured the rate of cross-reactivity with iiost proteins to be roughly 4%, Although chis is undoubtedly a higher race ciian statistical analysis vi'ould predict, the biological relevance of this number is questionable, since the studies were made under in vitro conditions. More importantly, the generation and activity of T cells tbat cross-react has not been adequately demonstrated. In related research, Wucherpfennig & Strominger (53) tested apanel of I 29 peptides from pathogens chat mimicked the T-cell epitope of MBP on T-cell clones from MS patients. Only eight peptides efficiently activated some of tiiese clones, of whicli only one could be easily identified as a molecular mimic of the original epitopt^. Missing from their analysis was a comparison to similar host peptides. Furthermore, the biological consequence of such cross-reactivity was not demonstrated. In fact, many reports have documented the appearance of self-reactive T cells in patients with autoimmune disease as well as in healthy individuals. The generation of cross-reactive T cells not oniy requires a chc case of die puCative epitopes fi'om CB4 P2C and GAD, despite their similar amino acid sequences, no one had demonstrated that these are ciie accual immtmogenic epiCopes processed and presenced by the MHC, In the somewhat convincing work of Fujiuami & Oidscone (45), rabbiCs were injecCed wich a pepcide from che hepatitis B virus poiymerase. This peptide's sequence cioseiy resembled that of MBP, and the injected rabbits developed a CNS disease similar to EAE, Yet, to dace, the infection of iiumans wicii iiepaCicis B has iioc been associated witb encephalomyelitis-like symptoms. Regardless of repeated attempts Co demonscrace molecular mimicry between sequeuces of host aud patiiogen at the Ievei of T-cell recogiiition, only a smail number of epitopes have proven capabie of cross-accivacion, and vircually all chese experiments bypass the critical steps of antigen processing and presentation. And nit>re importantiy, in no case have T cells speciflc to pathogens been able to mt^diate autoimmunity in vivo. So, even though some evidence exists to verify the invoivemeut of molecular mimicry in autoimmune pathology, for the most part, even chat evidence seems mere coincidence, leaving other mechanisms of disease promocion as stronger candidaccs. Viruses as reactivators of autoimmune disease Not oniy can viruses trigger autoimmune diseases hut chey are also likely, be imporcant in the reactivation and cbronicity of autoimmunity. After an initial event that generates and expands a popuiation of seif-reaccive T cells, subsequent iuft^ctions can serve to restimuiate and further amplify tiiis autoimmune response. Recent evidence supports two possible mechanisms for viral restimulation of autoimmune disease leading to relapses or exacerbation of disease: cross-activation of self-reactive memory lymphocytes and stimulation of sclf-antigeu diversification.",

            "text": "mice tiiat had previously been exposed Co LCMV Since these mice did not develop CNS disease after cheir first exposure to LCMV, clearly self-reactive (LCMV trausgene-specific) memory iymphocytes established by the prior LCMV iufection were required. Most important, once LCMV memory lymphocytes had been established, infections wich viruses other than LCMV also caused disease, most likely, through cross-(nonspecific) activation of the LCMV-specific memory T cells. During experiments on transgenic mice with MBP-specific T ceh receptors, EAF developed spontaneously in animais housed in a non-sterile environment (103), Furthermore, disease reqnired breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (97) and a role for a pathogen was indicated. These observations demonstrate tbat the TCR repertoire and exposure to environmental agents both influence suscepcibihty to GNS autoimmune disease. Alsoimplied is that the deveiopmcut ofa self-reactive repertoire and a history of viral infections are crucial to the development of autoimmune disease. In fact, tiic iattcr results are similar to the outcomes t)f coxsackie viral infectious iu BDC mice described earlier (89), In that case, tuimaniptdated mice did not develop spontaneous disease, altiiough tbey harbored a T-cell popuiation composed primarily of memory cells specific for an islet granule antigen. Only after tissue hrcakdow-u imparted by coxsackie viral infection was disease induced (89), Somewhat similarly, children who were vaccinated as protection from polio, and later received poliovirus booster immunizations developed immuDe responses to unrelated antigens, including reovirus aud tetanus toxoid, chereby indicaciug chaC secondary activation of immune responses also occurs in humans (104). Additionally, in patients wicii MS, disease exacerbates following common viral infections (15-17), Therefore, viruses play a major part in restimulating aud enhancing the autoimmune response during chronic or long-term autoimmune disease. Undoubcedly, repeaCed viral infeccions over a suscepCible paCieiic's lifetime could euhauce the opportunity to develop autoimmune disease. The cross-activation of memory T cells specific for an oiigodendrocyte protein by virai exposures subsequent to the ini-CiaCing iniection may accounC for periodic cxaccrbacions of disease in pacients with MS, Sucli repeated iufections may also explain both the long lag period before die symptoms of this disease manifest and the risk factor association Co che first I 5 years of life in MS patiencs, A cross-reactive immune response to oligodendrocyte-specific antigens through a of resting memory lyTtiphocytes simply caused by uoii-antigenic stimuiation following uprcgulation of cytokine expression in response to any viral infeccion? Recent evidence has implicated type 1 IENs in the reactivation of specific memory lymphocytes (90), and, of course, viral infecti(jus are key mediators of type I IFNs (105), As stated carhc-r, the upregulation of systemic Cype 1 TFN was not enough to activate diabecogcnic T ceils iu transgeuic BDC2,5 mice infected with LCMV (89) or treated with poly I:C (M, S, Horwitz, N, Sarvetuick, in preparation). Results from otber investigators (98, 99), imply tiiat au additional factor is required to reactivate lymphocytes and drive autoimmunity Merely activating potential autoimmune responses is not enough to cause disease. Yet, in some instances, viral cross-activation has increased disease (25, 7 5). Tough & Sprenc (96) have described the pocencial for crossaccivacion during uifecCion aud indicaCed that CD8\" T cells arc the populatiou predominantly reactivated by type i IFNs, GD4* T cells arc not shniiarly reactivated wich IFN type I stimuiation.",

            "text": "like IL-10 have been shown to have immuno stimulatory properties with respect to antigen-presenting cells (I 08), In particular, IL-10, when overexpressed in pancreatic p celis of transgenic mice, has accelerated disease (109), Additionally, IL-10 expression is required for the development of iiisuiitis (33). However, despite the necessity for IL-10 in the early progression of diabetes (33, 110), this cytokine also acts during diabetes by modulating CD8' lymphocytes and does not require B-cell participation (111), Although originally thought to be a SLippressor of the inflammatory response similar in action to other Th2 type cytokines like IL-4, recent data have ascribed to IL-10 a function in the inflammatory pathway. Indeed, expres-NOD mouse renders this area an important one for further investigation. Another incriguing observation is that severai viruses, including FIIV-l, FBV, Thieler's mtirine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and respiratory syncytiai virus, have been shown to induce IL-i 0 in vivo along with other inflammatory cytokines (1 12-1 16), Moreover, in comparisons of FAF and TMEV infection, both of which indtice a demyeiiuating disease similar to MS, TL-1 0 expression was observed before or coinciding witii the onset of ciinical disease and continuing throughout its course (115), Elsewhere, IL-10 did not specifically accompany remissions of disease but, instead, was expressed continuously throughout all stages of chronic disease, including relapses as well as remissions (1 i 5), In these experiments and others by the Miiier laboratory using EAE and TMFV to indtice CNS disease, antigenic diversification and epicope spreading were found over the course of disease (25, 26, 1 15), and this change of epitopes cieariy correlated with relapses iii clinical disease. Additionally, the Rodriguez laboratory (117) showed that CD8\" T cells arc essential in the development of clinically evident demyelinating disease induced by TMEV. By infecting an indtvidtiai in a way that produces a limited and controlled autoreactive response, a virus could induce local upreguiation ofa cytokine like TL-1 0 and consequently diversify the self response locaily. We speculate tiiat IL-10 upregtilation could lead to an increased magnitude and efficiency of kiliing within the CD8\" T-cell compartment, damaging tisstie aud, thtis, releasiug antigen to be presented by B cells so as to further diversify the response. The importance of IL-10 in association with antigenic diversification and disease relapse as well as its important meciianism of facilitating CD8+ T-ceU target destruction is a critical area of investigation. Another cytokine invoived in virai pathogenesis and possibly ill diversifying the respouse fVom antiviral to antiself is TGF-p, TGF-P is piuripotent in its activity and has been implicated ill the immune response as a suppressor ofthe iiifiammatory pathway and aiso in the regeneration of injured cisstie. Expression of TGF-p in the pancreata of NOD mice protected them from TDDM (36), Of particular interest, this protection was mediated by alterations in preferences of tiie autigen-presentiug cells resuUing in polarization ofthe response towards a Tii2 piienotype. Furthermore, TGF-p appeared to act in influence the responding T-ccll subsets. This lypically results in protection from autodestructive disease tiirough this decrease in the population of autoreactive lymphocytes. However, by makiug a change in the T-cell subsets that respond following infectioji, it is hypotiieticaiiy possible ciiat autoreactive T cells couid be inadvertently activated and lead to disease. As one might expect after infection iiy a uumiier of different viruses, TGF-p is indeed upregulated (115, I 19-122), In fact, TGF-p expression has been specificaiiy observed after infection with TMEV, HSV, EBV and chronic hepatitis C viral infection (II 5, 119-122), Curiously, the viruses associated with increased TGF-P levels are also chronic or persistent pathogens, Specificaiiy, tiic severity of HSV-1-induced pneumonia was supposedly governed by viral dysregulation (.)f TGF-p rather than viral replication (1 19). The role, if any, of TGF-p in these diseases is conjectural so far but is worthy of clarification. As a maccer of course, inuiuine responses follow viral infeccions. CounCer-regulaCory responses arc critical co control damage to clic host. Previous results, mainly from in vifro scudies, indicate chat cytokines can be classed as cither imiiiunoscimulatory or immunostippressive. However, during the past several years many cytokines, sucii as TT.-4, 11,-6, TGF-p, TFN-y, TL-10, TNF-a, and TNF-p, have been associated wich both induction and ccssacioii of autoimmnne diseases (28-39). The disease outcome from each individual signal varies depending upon whether the signal Is experienced locaiiy or syscemically, and the specific scagc of chc disease during which the signal is present, Cieariy, a balance exists, and ultimately many factors play into whether a particular cytokine acts to stimulate or suppress. Indeed, the progression toward disease is qtiitc complex, and factors affecting diverse processes such as GTL killing might be disease promoting early or disease inhibiting later depeudiug upon tbe state of differentiation of their tissue target, Tbe cycokine TL-4, expressed in pancreatic islets, is able to completely block insuiitis and clinical disease in the NOD mouse (34), Htnvever, co-expressed in conjtinction with a TCR transgene chat results in a monoclonal CD4 T-cell repertoire reactive Coward islet antigen, clinical disease is actually pro-specific target tisstie may also govern the pathway ofthe immime response. Studies with IFN-y in \\itro and in vivo indicate its propensity to stimulate ceiiuiar auC(niiimunity (123, 124), However, interestingly, when tiiis molecule is present in the neuromuscular junction, htimoral autoimmunity not cellular atitoimmtuiity results (I 2S), Therefore tiie tissue and the specific signal co-participate in dL'tcriiiining the ultj mate pathway ofthe response, A further understanding of the diverse mechanisms oi these effector molecules wichin individual tissues is dearly warranted. Increased understanding in this area will allow therapeutic intervention moduiating these complex moiecuies. Conclusions Muitipk factors from genetic and environmentai sources underlie the pathogenicity of autoimnuine diseases Hke IDDM and MS, These diseases have long prodromal phases before clinical onset and are, thereafti^, characterized by iiuiiierotis relapses and exacerbations. All chese qtialities are typical aftermaths of virus infection, Becatise viruses effectively activate autoreacCive lymphocytes through both crossreactive epitope stimulation (molecular mimicry), and i^ystandcr damage and activation, viral activities can break immnn(.ilogical tolerance and initiate autoinununity We have described meciianisnis by which molecular mimicry and bystander activation could create an autoiinmune state. Evidence from muitiple systems demonstrates that bystander activation is a key factor in the viral induction of autoimmune disease, whereas the importance of molecular mimicry is less well established and conies under question, ln addition, we present evidence that viruses have the power to reactivate an antoinimtme response as disease exacerbates to the level of clinical onset, A better understanding of these mechanisms, vira! cross-activation as well as local cyCokine induction, may allow ns to focus imniunotherapeutic strategies not necessarily on preventing disease but on events that mitigate disease. Reducing or suppressing the antiviral response in susceptible individuals sbould enable us to decrease the severity or delay tiie onset of clinical antoimmune disease.",
