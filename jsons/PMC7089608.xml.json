Neonatal diarrhea is primarily caused by the four most prevalent enteropathogens in calves including rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli K99, and Cryptosporidium spp. (Meganck et al., 2014). Mono-infections with one pathogen or co-infections with two or more pathogens are commonly seen (Brar et al., 2017, Cai et al., 2017). Among them, Cryptosporidium spp. and rotavirus are most frequently identified in fecal specimens from neonatal calves all over the world (Cho et al., 2013, Al Mawly et al., 2015, Mohamed et al., 2017).",

The association of Cryptosporidium infection with bovine diarrhea was first reported in 1978 (Pohlenz et al., 1978). This was followed by direct demonstration of the occurrence of diarrhea in experimentally infected calves (Tzipori et al., 1983). Since then, cryptosporidiosis has been considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea and enteritis in neonatal calves globally (Blanchard, 2012, Cho and Yoon, 2014, Wang et al., 2017). Recently, several cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been reported in neonatal calves in Australia, Estonia, India and China, resulting in high mortality and substantial economic losses (Izzo et al., 2011, Randhawa et al., 2012, Cui et al., 2014, Brar et al., 2017, Niine et al., 2018).",

            "text": "We identified cryptosporidiosis as the likely cause for the outbreak of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves described in this study. This was largely based on results of the initial EIA test, which identified the presence of C. parvum and rotavirus in the 18 seriously ill calves examined during the outbreak. Two other common enteropathogens for neonatal calf diarrhea, coronavirus and E. coli K99, were ruled out as the cause of the diarrhea. The role of rotavirus in the occurrence of the diarrhea outbreak appears to be small, as only fewer than half of the seriously ill calves had the infection and rotavirus infection was not significantly associated with the occurrence of moderate or watery diarrhea in calves during post-outbreak investigation. This was further supported by the peak occurrence of rotavirus infection in calves at 1 week of age, which is slightly earlier than the age range (10\u201320 days) of ill calves during the outbreak. The identification of cryptosporidiosis as the cause of the diarrhea outbreak was substantiated by genotyping of Cryptosporidium spp. in calves. All Cryptosporidium-positive ill calves had C. parvum instead of C. bovis, which is the dominant Cryptosporidium sp. in pre-weaned calves in China but mostly avirulent (Feng and Xiao, 2017). In addition, the occurrence of C. parvum in pre-weaned calves was significantly higher during the outbreak than after the outbreak (OR = 5.7\u2013129.6), and C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves in a post-outbreak investigation. Nevertheless, rotavirus could have played a secondary role in the outbreak of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned dairy calves on the farm, as suggested by investigations of outbreaks of calf diarrhea in Australia and India (Izzo et al., 2011, Brar et al., 2017). In this study, pathological investigations were not conducted on dead calves due to the distant nature of the farm from research facilities. We became involved with the investigation when the outbreak was nearing the end, and the fecal specimens from the 18 seriously ill calves were received by express mail.",

In these earlier studies, the detection of Cryptosporidium infections was based on microscopy or an EIA test. Although the species involved was unknown, it was reasonable to assume that these outbreaks were caused by C. parvum, which is well known to cause watery diarrhea (Meganck et al., 2014). In one recent study in Estonia, however, the C. parvum subtype IIaA18G1R1 was identified as the cause of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in pre-weaned dairy calves (Niine et al., 2018). Similarly in China, the only reported bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak was caused by the C. parvum subtype IIdA15G1 (Cui et al., 2014). That outbreak occurred on a dairy farm in Ningxia, northwestern China, leading to the death of 356 calves. Unlike the finding in Ningxia, the bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak reported in the present study was caused by the C. parvum subtype IIdA19G1. Although C. parvum is still an emerging Cryptosporidium sp. in dairy cattle in China, IIdA15G1 and IIdA19G1 subtypes are dominant C. parvum subtypes in pre-weaned dairy calves (Feng and Xiao, 2017, Wang et al., 2017).",

The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium spp. was 14.2%, which is similar to the average prevalence rate (14.0%) in dairy cattle in China (Wang et al., 2017). As in most previous studies in China and elsewhere (Fayer et al., 2010, Venu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2017), declining infection rates with increased age was also observed in the present study, with the infection rate in pre-weaned calves (22.7%) significantly higher than those in post-weaned calves (8.4%) and adult cattle (1.0%). Among the four Cryptosporidium spp. identified on the farm in the present study, C. parvum was the most frequently detected species in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae and C. bovis were dominant in post-weaned calves, whereas C. andersoni was only identified in three older animals. This is largely in agreement with the age-related distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. in dairy cattle elsewhere in the world (Xiao, 2010). However, as in some locations of China (Cai et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2017), C. bovis and C. ryanae were also common in pre-weaned dairy cattle. In fact, C. ryanae was not only the most common species identified in post-weaned calves, but also more prevalent than C. bovis in pre-weaned calves in the present study. Due to the high infection rates of both C. bovis and C. ryanae, a high rate of co-infections with the two Cryptosporidium spp. was also observed in this study.",
