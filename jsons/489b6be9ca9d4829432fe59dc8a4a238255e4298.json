The genetic co-clustering of BetaCoVs among closely related bats reflects host taxon-23 specificity with each bat family as the host for a specific BetaCoV group, potentially a natural barrier 24 against random transmission. The divergent pathway of BetaCoV and host evolution suggests that the 25 viruses were introduced just prior to bat dispersal and speciation. As such, deviant patterns were 26 observed such as for 2D-IV, wherein cross-taxon transmission due to overlap in bat habitats and 27 geographic range among genetically divergent African bat hosts could have played a strong role on their 28 shared CoV lineages. In fact, a few bat taxa especially the subfamily Pteropodinae were shown to host 29 diverse groups of BetaCoVs. Therefore, ecological imbalances that disturb bat distribution may lead to 30 loss of host specificity through cross-taxon transmission and multi-CoV infection. Hence, initiatives that 31 minimize the destruction of wildlife habitats and limit wildlife-livestock-human interfaces are encouraged to 32 help maintain the natural state of bat BetaCoVs in the wild. 33 34 35 36 Importance 37 Bat Betacoronaviruses (BetaCoVs) pose a significant threat to global public health and have been 38 implicated in several epidemics such as the recent pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome 39 coronavirus 2. Here, we show that bat BetaCoVs are predominantly host-specific, which could be a 40 natural barrier against infection of other host types. However, a strong overlap in bat habitat and 41 geographic range may facilitate viral transmission to unrelated hosts, and a few bat families have already 42 been shown to host multi-CoV variants. We predict that continued disturbances on the ecological balance 43 may eventually lead to loss of host specificity. When combined with enhanced wildlife-livestock-human 44 interfaces, spillover to humans may be further facilitated. We should therefore start to define the 45 ecological mechanisms surrounding zoonotic events. Global surveillance should be expanded and 46 strengthened to assess the complete picture of bat coronavirus diversity and distribution and their 47 potential to cause spillover infections. 48 49 7).",

Two new species of HCoVs, the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 76 were also discovered in 2004 and 2005, respectively (15). Disease types caused by HCoVs usually range 77 from gastrointestinal infections, upper respiratory infections, and lower respiratory infections such as 78 pneumonia (16). Further studies revealed that CoVs cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological 79 diseases in animals like bats, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, mice, horses, and whales (17). Moreover, the 80 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which have clear zoonotic origins have also been found to cause lower 81 respiratory infections such as pneumonia. In particular, SARS-CoV has been associated with diffuse 82 alveolar damage (DAD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while MERS-CoV has been 83 linked to renal failure (16). Recently, SARS-CoV2 has been reported to cause pneumonia, ARDS and 84 multiple organ failure (7,18). CoVs can be transmitted via fecal-oral route, respiratory, as well as contact 85 transmission (19). The spread of SARS-CoV has been primarily attributed to human-human transmission via direct contact with respiratory droplets and exposure to fomites (20). Similarly, although no evidence 87 of being sustained, human-human transmission has also been reported for MERS-CoV infections (21). 88 The World Health Organization (WHO) released guidelines on how to limit human-human transmission, 89 and reduce the risk of animal-human transmission in order to contain the rapidly spreading COVID-19 90 disease that started in Wuhan, China (22).",

Instead, this is indicative that the currently circulating viruses may have been introduced relatively recently, i.e. to the most recent common ancestors of each bat taxon but prior to 283 global dispersion and speciation, during which the virus acquired adaptation to its host. The recent 284 introduction of BetaCoVs in bats implies that other factors may have had the opportunity to influence 285 virus-host dynamics. In the succeeding discussions, we will present two deviant phenomena that 286 exemplify this: cross-taxon transmission of CoVs and bat hosts with multi-CoV lineages.",

This classification can 240 correct the GenBank annotation of deviant samples such as the BetaCoVs that grouped with AlphaCoVs, 241 and add information on the currently unclassified BetaCoVs in GenBank.

These findings support previous 255 reports (31) which we have expanded here to identify the specific bat taxon associated with each 256 BetaCoV group and a more extensive analysis of fruit bat CoVs. Network analysis showed no clear trends 257 in the geographical distribution of closely related BetaCoVs except for 2D-IV, which is composed of four 258 genetically distinct bat hosts (family Pteropodidae subfamily Pteropodinae, Epomophorinae, and 259 Rousettinae; and family Hipposideridae), but all of which are found in Africa. Hence, host specificity could 260 play a major role in BetaCoV diversity, except for 2D-IV for which geography may have a stronger 261 influence.262Host specificity is uncommon in other bat-infecting viruses such as Paramyxoviruses and 263 Papillomaviruses, which have been reported to have prevalent host switches (32,33).

E. glaucinus has a wide distribution in South America that 290 overlaps with the vesper bat Eptesicus sp. (43,44), which is an opportunity for cross-species transmission 291 of CoVs. Another example is the Pteropodinae bat Dobsonia moluccensis, Dyacopterus spadiceus, and 292 M. minimus that carried Nobecoviruses from various subgroups. Dobsonia sp. and Rousettinae bats are293 primarily cave dwellers that have been documented to co-roost in the same cave habitat (45-49), which 294 could explain their shared BetaCoVs from lineage 2D-I . Evidence of forage site overlap has also been 295 documented for Cynopterus sp. and other Pteropodinae bats such as M. minimus which also feeds on 296 banana and palm trees, and Dyacopterus spadiceus which have been documented to feed together with 297 Cynopterus horsfieldii in the same foliage site (45). Here, we reported that these Cynopterinae and 298 Pteropodinae bats have BetaCoVs that commonly belong to 2D-II. A final example is 2D-IV, which is 299 composed of four genetically distinct bat hosts from Epomophorinae, Pteropodinae (E. helvum), 300 Rousettinae (R. aegyptiacus), and Hipposidiridae/Old World leaf-nosed bats (T. persicus). The diverse 301 hosts of 2D-IV could be explained by overlaps in foraging, roosting, and distribution of African bats. For 302 example, Rousettus aegyptiacus has been reported to share the same foraging site with Epomophorus 303 gambianus (50). Meanwhile, Eidolon helvum roosts gregariously, exhibiting an annual migration pattern 304 as a function of food supply and has a wide distribution range in the African continent (51-53), which 305 overlaps with the distribution and range of other Epomophorinae fruit bats in Africa.

It has been reported that different receptor-binding S1 subunit C-314 terminal domains (S1-CTDs) from different coronavirus lineages can recognize the same receptor (56).For example, the Lys353 amino acid in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) plays a crucial role 316 for the binding of the SARS-CoV and the HCoV-NL63, both of which are very divergent coronaviruses, 317 the former being a Betacoronavirus, and the latter belonging to the alphacoronavirus lineage.",

A good demonstration of this is the evolution of human SARS-327 CoV which is believed to have occurred in a stepwise fashion, with the spike protein undergoing early 328 selective pressure probably to mediate the switch from animal to human hosts, followed by the RdRp in 329 the late stages to facilitate a more efficient replication in humans (42).

C. brachyotis is 352 locally abundant and widely distributed throughout urbanized and secondary forests in both South and 353 Southeast Asian regions, and have a high fruit species diversity in its diet (68). It is therefore 354 recommended to explore the incidence of CoVs in the wild population of C. brachyotis in the Philippines, 355 which may present a higher risk for future spillover infection in animal and/or human populations due to 356 their presence in urban communities. On the other hand, the absence of CoV detection in other fruit bat 357 species in this study does not rule out the possibility of these bats as reservoirs. This could have been 358 due to sampling bias, i.e. non-Cynopterus species comprised only~30% of the captured bats, which 359 highlights the need to strengthen surveillance efforts for BtCoVs in individual countries to estimate the 360 true burden of viral diversity and distribution.
