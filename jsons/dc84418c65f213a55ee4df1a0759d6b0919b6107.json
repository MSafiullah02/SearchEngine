The first case of infection in response to a new strain of Coronaviridae, designated Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was recorded in Wuhan, China [1] . This virus appears to be weaker than SARS, in terms of pathogenesis but more sustained in its transmission behavior [2] . COVID-19 is transmitted through droplet inhalation, saliva, nasal and mucous membranes of eyes. Symptoms include fever, continuous coughing and shortness of breath. This has been shown to lead to a mild or severe respiratory illness and, in a number of cases, death. However, this is largely dependent upon the health status of the patient, with highest risk associated with those who have pre-existing respiratory tract pathologies [3] . As of April 2, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 896,450 cases of COVID-19 and 45,525 deaths worldwide. The number is growing, and urgent clinical strategies are needed [supplementary materials 1].",

Recent findings demonstrate the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines in several respiratory system diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The biological functions of this cytokine include i) the production of chemokines such as IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and growth-regulated oncogene-\u03b1 (Gro-\u03b1) which increase the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, ii) the production of IL-6, a cytokine produced by macrophages, epithelial cells and T cells in response to extracellular microorganisms, iii) the production of the hematopoietic cytokines such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocytemacrophage (GM)-CSF, that stimulate the expansion of myeloid lineages and the production of other mediators such as IL-1, TNF-\u03b1 and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [6] . Moreover, it has been reported that IL-17 is associated with several inflammatory respiratory diseases. Laan and colleagues reported that the autocrine action of IL-17 encourages the production of chemokines such as IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial and venous endothelial cells, thereby promoting the influx of neutrophils and exacerbating airway inflammation [supplementary materials 5].",

This poses an interesting paradigm whereby IL-17 released from innate cellular components, may direct lung structural cells to respond more vigorously. Our hypothesis is also in accordance to a recent article from Wu & Yang [7] which reviewed Th17 responses in patients with SARS-CoV-2. They found that peripheral blood cells from patients with severe COVID-19 infection had strikingly high numbers of circulating Th17 cells which were associated with a \"cytokine storm\" including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, IL-17, G-CSF, interferon \u03b3induced protein 10 (IP-10), MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIPs) and TNF-\u03b1. As a result of this hyper-inflammatory state, the authors suggested the use of Fedratinib, a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) small molecule inhibitor which is involved in the suppression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), as a potential therapeutic agent for patients with elevated Th17 (but also Th1) type immune profiles [8, 9] .",

This would potentially provide a rationale for testing neutralizing antibodies targeting IL-17. Could targeting IL-17 alone or in combination with IL-6 supersede other therapeutic approaches? A global effort by the research community will certainly help to tackle such questions and we hope to be part of this.",
