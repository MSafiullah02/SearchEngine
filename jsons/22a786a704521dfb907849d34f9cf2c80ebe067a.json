Multiple fields have used telemedicine to continue care while maintaining social distancing and quarantine practices in the pandemic. Presented in this paper is a review describing the application of telemedicine in caring for surgical patients, and methods for potential implications of telehealthcare for surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A review of the PubMed Central and Medline provides articles examining the role of telemedicine for preoperative, postoperative, and follow up evaluation of surgical patients encompassing the past two decades. Additionally, articles examining the financial and legal considerations of telemedicine, and the effect COVID-19 has had on the current legislature were included. We report the summarized findings of these studies, the financial and HIPAA considerations of using telemedicine, potential benefits, pitfalls and strategies for the utilization of telemedicine into the clinical practice of general surgery and its subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In efforts to mitigate transmission and spread of the virus, social distancing, closure of public spaces, and quarantines have been implemented across the country. Despite the unfolding pandemic, other diseases require treatment, and will through what could be months of social distancing in the foreseeable future. Patients still require post-op care, emergency procedures, and surgical evaluations for time-sensitive new diagnoses. Telehealth may be able to help close the gap created by the pandemic and further our reach going forward. While surgery may not seem like it would lend itself to telehealth practices, multiple studies have shown it can be a viable modality for safe and effective surgical care as an alternative to in-office visits in the pre and post-operative periods. 1e3 There are three primary forms of telehealth, including video, telephone calls, and instant messaging, including email, health system messaging services, and mobile apps to track patient recorded metrics. While video conferences may be preferred, each has benefits and can be commonly accessible by patients in 2020.",

            "text": "While no current guidelines exist for preoperative evaluations or general surgery consults, the literature suggests that all preoperative telehealth evaluations should undergo an in-person evaluation by the operative surgeon on the morning of the surgery. 1, 5, 6 While telehealth is limited by the lack of physical exam, this can be overcome by through using video conferencing for consults. Telehealth evaluations provide the unique advantage of allowing a local primary care physician or mid-level to consult the surgeon remotely, and perform a supervised physical exam. 1,6 Furthermore, telehealth offers patients timely visits, often sooner than an inperson visit, and has high rates of satisfaction from patients and clinicians. 1, 5, 6 Surgical subspecialties and oncologic resections lend themselves well to telehealth preoperative surgical evaluations, as demonstrated in a study by Cerfolio et al. published in June 2019, with 55 of 56 patients enrolled underwent thoracic oncology surgeries. 5 Postoperatively, telemedicine offers a variety of modalities easily accessible by patients and surgeons. Video conferences and pictures were taken on a smartphone are effective for follow-ups, including the detection of post-operative complications and even saves patients time. 2 A study in 2017 also used mobile phone pictures for early detection of post-operative complications following appendectomy (laparoscopic or open) and found a 100% sensitivity, 91.6% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 100%. 6 These favorable results include patients undergoing complex oncologic surgeries. 2, 5 Historically, there has been a lack of legal guidelines and stringent HIPAA policies that have been amended to allow use of easily accessible technologies like Skype and FaceTime for telehealth from the patient own home. 8 The Center for Medicare Services (CMS) expanded coverage and reimbursement of telehealth encounters, with state Medicaid and private insurances left to decide under public eye. 9 These changes allow for greater accessibility to telehealth for both patients and providers.",
