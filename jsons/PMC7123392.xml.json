According to WHO reports, 80% of people in developing countries use natural medicines for their primary health care needs (Yadav et al. 2014). Bioactive herbal compounds are used in the manufacturing of plant-based drugs, which have unique properties with long-term effects and good compatibility in the body. Alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, terpenes, and sterols are the major phytochemicals that can be used as herbal medicines if taken in appropriate amounts. They are present in fruits and vegetables (Saxena et al. 2013). Some plant-based drugs that have been introduced in the USA over time are vincristine, vinblastine, reserpine, and deserpidine (Fabricant and Farnsworth 2001).",

LBVS techniques involve pharmacophore and three-dimensional (3D) shape matching, quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSARs), and likeness and substructure searches. A standout among the most well known ligand-based drug design approaches is QSAR. The objective of QSAR is to determine the connection between the basic/physicochemical properties of active compounds and their biological activity. The use of virtual screening for hit and lead identification involves a group of procedures based upon the data that have already been collected regarding the targeted and/or existing ligand earlier in the screening process. Machine learning is rapidly becoming popular in LBVS as novel calculations are proposed to manufacture precise and strong QSARs. Diverse techniques are proposed, and every technique has its own points of interest and detriments. Among these strategies, regression and classification methods\u2014for example, multiple linear regression (MLR) , nearest neighbor, na\u00efve Bayesian classification, support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees\u2014are effectively connected. Discovery of novel lead compounds through computational use of experimentally determined protein structures, obtained from screening of databases through focused design exercises, is well established (Jain 2004).",

Nowadays, various docking programs are commercially (or freely) accessible, with various conformational sampling algorithms and an assortment of scoring functions. Scoring of ligands is a pivotal advance in the achievement of SBVS. In spite of the fact that prediction of the ligand binding site is generally conceivable with the accessible strategies, scoring is still extremely difficult, and it is consequently hard to distinguish the right binding site or to rank compounds.",

For synthesis of nanoparticles, noble metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) are used because of their unique d\u2013d transition characteristics and high localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomena (Khan et al. 2017, Mohan et al. 2014; Dreaden et al. 2012). Gold, platinum, silver, and palladium nanoparticles 20 nm in size have characteristic colors of wine red, yellow, grey-black and dark black, respectively (Khan et al. 2017). Copper nanoparticles have special properties, which have made them important for various applications such as antimicrobials, catalysts, biosensors, nanoscale drugs, drug delivery, and targeted drug delivery systems (Cerda et al. 2017; Rajesh et al. 2018). Gold, silver, copper, etc., can be excellent metals for use in various biomedical applications, such as cellular imaging, photothermal therapy, and biocides (Singh et al. 2016). Nanoparticles can be synthesized to include various types of chemical reducing agents, plant extracts, or enzymes (Cerda et al. 2017; Prasad 2014). These are effective agents with low toxicity, which is especially important in the biomedical field (Rajesh et al. 2018). For synthesis of nanoparticles, a number of reducing agents are used, such as ascorbic acid, lithium aluminum hydride, and sodium borohydride (Cerda et al. 2017; Wu and Chen 2004; Tang et al. 2010). Reducing agents reduce metal ions, followed by agglomeration into clusters. These clusters eventually form metallic colloidal particles (Hussein 2016). Some nanoparticles have excellent physical and chemical properties but do not possess suitable surface properties for specific applications. Apart from the cost effectiveness of copper nanoparticles, the stability of these nanoparticles is matter of concern; therefore, it may be necessary to modify the surface of the metals (Ruckenstein and Li 2005). A common method used for surface modification of these nanoparticles is addition of suitable organic groups to the positively charged surface atoms of the metal (Kickelbick and Schubert 2003).",

For example, metal particles can be made water soluble when suitable groups are attached. A third reason for modifying nanoparticles is to enable their self-organization (Neouze and Schubert 2008; Kickelbick and Schubert 2003; Doty et al. 2005). Metal nanoparticles can be synthesized by various methods such as metal vapor synthesis, photolytic reduction, radiolytic reduction, the sonochemical method, solvent extraction reduction, the microemulsion technique, the polyol process, and alcohol reduction (Cerda et al. 2017). Physical and chemical methods are most widely used for synthesis of different nanoparticles. However, the physical methods are very expensive, while the chemical methods are detrimental to the environment, as well as to living organisms (Shamaila et al. 2016). Moreover, these methods require expensive instruments, high energy, release of harmful chemicals, cell culture, and wasteful purification. The chemical reduction method has some advantages; for example, it is simple and inexpensive, and it is easy to control the size and shape of the nanoparticles. However, it has some disadvantages that can harm the environment, such as the need for disposal of noxious solvents and dangerous chemical reducing agents (Cerda et al. 2017).",

In green nanosynthesis of metal nanoparticles, use of (1) nontoxic chemicals used as reducing agents, (2) environmentally friendly solvents, and (3) renewable materials as stabilizing or passivating agents is very important to consider (Mohan et al. 2014; Prasad et al. 2018). Synthesis of nanoparticles using plant and plant-based biopolymers can be considered green chemistry. Plant extracts are used for metal ion reduction to form nanoparticles. Plant metabolites\u2014such as sugars, starches, proteins, polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolic acids, gums, and \u03b2-cyclodextrin\u2014play important roles in metal ion reduction into nanoparticles and their stability (Parveen and Rao 2015). In recent decades, some well known examples of carbohydrate polymers, such as chitosan, have been employed for synthesis of metal nanoparticles because of their interactions with metal ions and metal nanoparticles. With the increasing demand for adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly protocols, the use of biodegradable and nonbiodegradable precursors to prepare nanomaterials has been extensively explored. For instance, within the polysaccharide group, cyclodextrins have been applied as stabilizing agents to produce copper nanoparticles (Manivannan and Ramaraj 2012). \u03b2-Cyclodextrin is a nonreducing cyclic oligosaccharide with seven units of \u03b1-D-glucose. The glucose rings are connected through \u03b1-(1\u20134) linkage with a hydrophilic outer surface and a hydrophobic interior cavity (Navgire et al. 2016). \u03b2-Cyclodextrin can form inclusion complexes with various organic compounds (Gogoi and Sarma Chandra 2017) and act as stabilizing agent because particles synthesized with it have the smallest size distribution. This is due to the stiff structure and low water solubility of \u03b2-cyclodextrin, causing complex precipitation easily and thereby regulating the growth of the nanoparticles (Cerda et al. 2017).",

Applications of this old system are being rediscovered and could be of immense potential in yielding innovative metal\u2013herb formulations that could hold promise for use in biomedicine (Galib et al. 2011). For developing such preparations, the biocompatibility and therapeutic activity of phytoconstituents present in plants play a determining role in the choice of various herbs. Such herbomineral preparations could have better curative potential because of their physiological compatibility, minimal toxicity, natural origin, easy accessibility, and lower costs. The promising applications of such nanomaterial-based herbal preparations in the field of biomedicine have led to the innovative concept of herbonanoceuticals (Gomes et al. 2014). Many studies have shown that during the processing of Ayurvedic metal-based formulations, the size of the metal particles goes down to the nanometric range (Pavani et al. 2013). Gold is used as swarna bhasma (gold ash) in different conventional Indian Ayurvedic preparations and has been characterized as having a particle size of 56\u201357 nm and a spherical shape. Mercury-based Ayurvedic preparations include crystalline mercuric sulfide in a 25- to 50-nm size range (Pal et al. 2014). Pavani et al. (2013) reported a modified method of bhasmikaran (a method for preparing bhasma) for preparation of iron oxide nanoparticles, which was based on green synthesis. XRD and TEM analyses have demonstrated that during use of the Ayurvedic bhasmikaran method, metal nanoparticles are formed. The metal nanoparticles, along with various phytoconstituents, can lead to better absorption and even tissue-specific targeting of therapeutic ingredients in the body. Because of their small size, these preparations are said to be more effective, as naturally synthesized metal nanoparticles do not cause toxicity in the body (Paul and Chugh 2011).",

Polyphenols are the main phytoconstituents in plant extracts that possess the ability to act as reducing agents, mainly because of their hydroxyl side chains. These can act as capping and stabilizing agents for metal nanoparticle formation. Gold nanoparticles are among the most widely utilized metal nanoparticles in the biomedical field because of their biocompatibility (Bhattacharya and Mukherjee 2008). Geetha et al. (2013) reported a rapid, economical, and single-step method for formation of gold nanoparticles, utilizing a flower extract from Couroupita guianensis. Green synthesis of gold nanoparticles was reported using glucoxylans of Mimosa pudica seeds to which no extra chemical stabilizing agent was added (Iram et al. 2014). Rao et al. (2016) discussed different medicinal plants and their active compounds, as well as green-synthesized metallic nanoparticles from medicinal plants, in relation to their anticancer activities. Metal nanoparticles formed using plant extracts showed enhanced tumor specificity, promising activity, and reduced toxic effects on healthy cells. The cytotoxic effects of nanoparticles are predominantly due to their large surface area, which enables efficient drug delivery, and some nanoparticles exhibit anticancer activity.

Many researchers have put forward various methods for green synthesis of metal nanoparticles, employing microorganisms and plant extracts, that have been found to be eco-friendly, economical, and nontoxic (Makarov et al. 2014; Prasad et al. 2018). However, there are certain problems with metal nanoparticles, which need to be addressed prior to their commercial usage. The metal nanoparticles used for various purposes are reported to have diverse characteristics and diverse derivations, and are being utilized in various systems. However, their potential side effects in patients and the environment are yet to be thoroughly explored (Krug and Wick 2011). Contradictory biosafety considerations pertaining to metal nanoparticles have been reported in different studies (Tsoi et al. 2012; Edmundson et al. 2014; Ambwani et al. 2015).",

This chapter has focused on the collaboration of nanotechnology in progressing the bioavailability of promising phytochemicals, which may encounter delivery issues in their free-drug form. It has also shown that different natural products may yield compounds that are ideal for use in different nanoformulation systems. In any case, progress in nanomedicine\u2014regardless of whether it is phytochemical based or synthetic based\u2014fits to the clinical setting is advancing more slowly than expected, fundamentally because of safety issues and, in particular, the cost effectiveness of nanomedicines when the costs of manufacturing and therapeutic application are taken into consideration. In the event that these issues can be settled, phytochemical-based nanomedicines (herbonanoceuticals) may end up being favored choices for various therapeutic treatments in the future.",
