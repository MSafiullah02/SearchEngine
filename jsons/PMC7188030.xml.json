Some preliminary data suggest that severe lymphopenia and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, cardiac troponin I, and D-dimer correlate with the severity of hypoxemia and may predict hospital mortality.5,6 Case 1 with elevated D-dimer, and Case 2 with lymphopenia, elevated CRP and ESR, and biomarkers of cardiac injury (elevated CKMB and troponin) died.

It is not clear if Case 1 and Case 2, who were readmitted about 2 weeks after surgery, got the infection at the time of surgery or after hospital discharge in community. Obviously if Case 4 was not presenting with pulmonary manifestations (eg, if he was only in the incubation period of infection with minimal symptoms), he would have had the bariatric procedure the next day.",

Depending on the severity of an epidemic and availability of resources, the risk and benefits of performing elective surgical procedures should be carefully assessed in this setting. In locations with widespread infections and limited resources, the risk of elective surgical procedures for index patient and community may outweigh the benefit. In some situations, postponing elective surgical procedures might be the right decision which can also preserve the resources including the personal protective equipment and maintain treatment space for critical patients. Another option would be routine or selective screening of patients for COVID-19 before elective surgical procedures, which we feel is the minimum acceptable baseline. Utilizing telemedicine and virtual visits using a smartphone for perioperative visits can also be an option to decrease the risk of spreading the infection during the outbreaks. Although many questions remain unanswered about COVID-19 and surgical practice, the surgical and perioperative communities should appropriately respond to this worldwide public health crisis to improve patient outcomes and minimize the burden on the health care systems and global society.",
