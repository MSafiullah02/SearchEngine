            "text": "Epidemics are inherently spatial phenomena. According to an understanding that reaches back to the Hippocratic writings, the epidemic should not be mistaken for the illness itself. Rather, the term designates a certain mode of its dissemination. Combining the Greek epi (on, over, upon) with demos (people), \u2018epi-demics refers to a condition set upon people who are close in time and space\u2019 (Van Loon 2005: 42). Consequently, the different measures taken against epidemics have always reckoned with their spatiality. Ranging from villages barring themselves from strangers over techniques of quarantine and border policing to panoptic surveillance \u2014 the protective efforts against the spread of epidemics have regularly led to innovations in spatial design (Bashford 2006a). Epidemics and the political ordering of space thus share a common genealogy. Throughout history, the government of epidemics has entailed particular modes of governing space.",

Shortly after the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002, the legal scholar David Fidler (2003) characterised the coronavirus responsible for SARS as the \u2018first post-Westphalian pathogen\u2019. This statement indicates that a certain spatial matrix of government became problematic during the crisis. The de-territorialising logic of viral contagion was regarded to be at odds with the territorial segments that form the international order of modern states (Elden 2006). Confronted with this incompatibility, the WHO operated in an \u2018extra-legal experimental space\u2019 (Weir 2012: 323) to address the trans-border dynamics of disease transmission. Only after the emergency response, the requirements for a re-articulation of the political landscape were to be accommodated within the revised version of the main legal document designed to guarantee global health security: the International Health Regulations (IHR).",

Therefore, the IHR \u2014 whose final version was adopted in 2005 and was put into force by most of the WHO member states by 2007 \u2014 can be considered as a protocol of the attempts to reconfigure the contours of the Westphalian order. In a sense, SARS turned the world into a juridical-political laboratory in which new governmental geographies were delineated and tested. By incorporating the ad hoc measures taken against SARS into a fully fledged juridical framework, the IHR contain the efforts to rearticulate the coordinates of global political space. Accordingly, the IHR have to be analysed as a solution to the problem of how epidemic contagion is rendered governable in ways that resolve the constraints of the Westphalian territorial order.",

            "text": "Methodologically, the analysis is informed by the interdisciplinary field of \u2018legal geography\u2019 (Blomley 1994; Blomley et al. 2001). Authors in this field question the clear-cut division between space and law. Instead of opposing law as a textual domain of meaningful representations to a notion of space as materially given and static, law itself is considered to be spatialising: law circumscribes territorial orders, draws boundaries and configures mobilities. For capturing such modes of legal \u2018world-making\u2019, David Delaney (2004, 2010) has introduced the notion of the \u2018nomosphere\u2019 (24\u201333). The term is derived from the Greek nomos that relates to acts of division, separation and demarcation. Most famously, these connotations have assumed centre stage in Carl Schmitt\u2019s (2003) Nomos of the Earth. In this book, Schmitt traces the geopolitical contours of the international order enshrined in the Jus Publicum Europaeum. Unlike Schmitt, however, Delaney does not assume a mythological foundation of law in \u2018concrete spatial orders\u2019 \u2014 a view most palpable in Schmitt\u2019s portrayal of the Earth as the element that \u2018contains\u2019 and \u2018sustains\u2019 law (Schmitt 2003: 42; Dean 2006). Rather, Delaney seeks to highlight how law is constitutively involved in the articulation of always contingent spatialities. Accordingly, this article wants to look at how the IHR become imbricated in the production of our spatial present. Undertaking such \u2018nomospheric investigation\u2019, however, does not imply that legal documents shape the political cartography single-handedly in a causal way. They are but one element in the material practices that configure the spatial setup of global governmental assemblages (Collier and Ong 2005; Valverde 2015).",

Foucault is important in this context since he is one of the few thinkers who have emphasised the inherent connection between political rationalities, space and infectious disease (Legg 2005). For him, the history of modern political power is, to a large extent, a history of how epidemics were dealt with. Diseases such as leprosy, plague or smallpox gave rise to specific modes of spatial ordering that correspond with specific technologies of governing. This article adopts this perspective for understanding the making of \u2018nomospheres\u2019. It looks at the legal document of the IHR as an operative device in the fabrication of governmental spaces, which are supposed to provide security against the pandemic threats to come.",

Two particular nomospheric features encoded in the IHR stand out in this respect. The first concerns the referent object of governmental practice: the regulatory effort to secure global public health does not focus on human life so much as it does on post-human materialities of global traffic. Infrastructures and objects of mobility are its main concern. The second feature pertains to the particular type of territorial control envisioned under the current conditions of intense globalisation. For governing \u2018viral traffic\u2019, the IHR stipulate technologies such as screening and quarantine, which supplement the liberal image of a smooth and borderless world. These technologies re-territorialise the planetary space by forming thresholds at which the movement of risky bodies is interrupted and rhythmicised. The IHR thus constitute a \u2018nomadic nomos\u2019 (Vismann 2012: 37) that incorporates territorial strategies into the government of the networked topologies generated by global traffic.",

The first section reconstructs the relationship between epidemic crisis and the emergence of spatial orders to be found in Foucault. Unfolding this heuristic framework for the subsequent analysis of the IHR, it elaborates especially the role that legal concepts play in translating the idea of liberal circulation into the global sphere. Against this background, the second section investigates the peculiar mode in which the IHR constitute a nomosphere of global circulation. It traces the shifting concern from the health of the individual and the population towards a continuum of organic and inorganic bodies travelling along infrastructures of transmission. The third section focuses on the role played by technologies of thermal screening and quarantine in this peculiar rationality of governing circulation. It presents them as territorial strategies designed to govern the de-subjectified flows of universal traffic.",

            "text": "In Western modernity, issues of public health have never been just about health (Rosen 1993). They became deeply intertwined with politics and the making of political spaces in particular. Whereas the first quarantine regulations in the Mediterranean city-states of the fourteenth century were famously directed at maritime trade, it was not before the seventeenth century that sanitary measures \u2018came to be used consciously as instruments of statecraft\u2019 (Harrison 2013: 24). On the one hand, the politics of public health influenced states\u2019 external relations deeply. To combat the epidemics of the 1660s, England interfered with the Dutch trading empire by imposing quarantines against vessels sailing from Amsterdam; about a 100 years later, Austria had completed a sanitary cordon over 1,600 kilometres along the lines of a former military cordon at its Eastern border (Rothenberg 1973: 16); and in the nineteenth century, the European powers established consular commissions in Alexandria or Constantinople for \u2018defending Europe from Asiatic infections\u2019 (Harrison 2013: 70). On the other hand, public health had a tremendous impact on the internal politics of evolving nation states. A wide array of administrative practices, such as isolation, segregation, or urban planning, were led by the concern for health as a \u2018common good\u2019 \u2014 an understanding that triggered regulatory reforms to set up systems of \u2018medical police\u2019 by the end of the eighteenth century in most European states (Carroll 2002). Despite their extreme heterogeneity, all these instances share one common feature. In each case, the history of public health reveals itself to be tightly coupled with a history of spatio-political settings.",

Epidemics appear as singular moments of crisis that provoke the development of novel spatial orders and political technologies. However, Foucault is not so much interested in the historical vicissitudes as such as he uses the historical material to identify distinct rationalities. He distinguishes schematically the responses to leprosy, plague and smallpox, each of which is tied to the emergence of a peculiar cartography of power (Thacker 2009: 139\u201342).

The disciplinary response to the plague of the seventeenth century reverses this procedure. Its basic formula reads: \u2018Not rejection but inclusion.\u2019 (Foucault 2003: 46) Instead of drawing a single boundary delimiting an interior from an absolute exterior, discipline imposes a partitioning grid. It creates a space segmented into differentiated enclosures that seek to isolate individuals, reduce contacts and allow for panoptic surveillance. Foucault describes discipline as a form of \u2018counter law\u2019 for it works in the interstices of liberal law, subverting freedom and equality from below through its minute normalising procedures (Golder and Fitzpatrick 2009: 22\u20133).",

Within this political rationality, epidemic disease appears as a collective affair with immanent regularities to be rendered visible by statistics. It is dealt with as a mass phenomenon through measures of public hygiene and practices of inoculation. Accordingly, governmental power is not exercised over a territory but within a population. This, however, does not amount to a neglect of the individual. Rather, the government of populations is linked intrinsically with the individualisation of the liberal subject (Foucault 1978: 139\u201345). Modern biopolitics addresses the health of the population through individual well-being and vice versa (Foucault 2001: 13\u201327).",

The population forms a dynamic, living entity that is tied closely to the circulation of bodies, goods, and resources in space. Since the circulatory flows are considered to be the well-spring of the population, liberal government aims at protecting and enhancing this metabolism in its vital force against the inherent threat of disease (Swyngedouw 2006: 107\u201312; Dillon and Lobo-Guerrero 2008). Beyond this background, measures of containment and fixation through enclosures appear as inherently problematic. Each parcelling of space that hinders or even immobilises those elements that are assumed to circulate is seen to constrain the life process. Furthermore, since disease exists \u2018within a collective field\u2019 (Foucault 2007: 60) it cannot be simply externalised. It is an unfortunate, but intrinsic phenomenon that cannot be made subject to a total ban. All in all, liberal government is careful not to obstruct contacts. Rather, it facilitates and organises connectivities, aiming to secure them against their immanent dangers \u2014 \u2018maximizing the good circulation by diminishing the bad\u2019 (Foucault 2007: 18). In principle, the space of circulation is therefore an open and unbounded space. Liberal government operates, in Foucault\u2019s own words, \u2018centrifugally\u2019. \u2018New elements are constantly being integrated [\u2026].

Foucault himself devotes only a few pages to this consequence. However, this short passage \u2014 that has, thus far, also received relatively little attention \u2014 is of utmost importance for the current argument, since Foucault (2008) links the \u2018appearance of a new form of global rationality\u2019 in governmental practice with what he calls a \u2018juridification of the world\u2019 (56). After gesturing towards maritime law and the problem of piracy as examples of such \u2018elaboration of a worldwide space\u2019 (ibid.), he turns to Immanuel Kant\u2019s text on \u2018perpetual peace\u2019 (1795). In Kant, he finds the view that a global law beyond the state is to emerge from the inter-relations naturally occurring between humans all over the world. Whereas political philosophers usually adopt the Kantian premises for justifying the existence of cosmopolitan law, Foucault turns this normative position upside down by reading Kant archaeologically as a governmental script. A closer look at Kant might, therefore, illuminate Foucault\u2019s unusual, but innovative argument about the relation between the liberal government of global circulation and global law.",

In the German original, this intercourse is couched in terms of a natural \u2018flow\u2019 or \u2018in-fluence\u2019 (Kant 1977: 203) that traverses the borders of state territories.1 It establishes a form of interrelatedness that is always already transcending the space of international law into a cosmopolitan order. Kant deduces the latter from the spatial properties of the Earth. Because of its spherical shape \u2014 its Kugelgestalt \u2014 the Earth\u2019s surface forms a limited space in which human beings \u2018cannot disperse infinitely but must finally put up with being near one another\u2019 (Kant 1991: 329). The cosmopolitan right \u2018to present oneself for society\u2019 (ibid.) is thus rooted in the empirical features of global space (Eberl and Niesen 2011: 262\u201365). The Earth places humans irrevocably in a proximity to one another and it generates relations of communication and exchange across the world. The means of transport \u2014 such as ships or camels, the latter figuring in Kant\u2019s (1991) view as \u2018ships of the desert\u2019 (329) \u2014 support men in their commerce and facilitate mutual contact. They offer the technical basis for worldwide circulatory processes that follow \u2018naturally\u2019 from the Earth\u2019s spherical shape. In this way, the cosmopolitan right is derived from those natural circulations that it has to protect. It allows individuals to get in touch with each other irrespective of their national affiliation. It stabilises the capability to connect globally, a potential that is grounded in the spatial qualities of the Earth.",

It secures transnational traffic and communication, thereby constituting an infrastructure for circulatory movements. In this sense, law appears as a governmental technology. Again, it is worthwhile to underline the analytical twist at work here. Whereas a more traditional normative reading of Kant proceeds from a particular state of the world to a cosmopolitan juridical framework, the governmental reading observes how cosmopolitan law is devised as a tool to stabilise a liberal view of worldly processes. In one case, humanity\u2019s natural use of the perfectly rounded globe grounds an equally universal law. In the other case, law functions as a particular device for fostering specific modes of global movements. This difference matters strongly, since only the latter angle allows for investigating the practical work of establishing \u2018nomospheres\u2019. Only the second of the two viewpoints prompts empirical research to analyse how contemporary forms of global law are operative in developing governmental cartographies: How do legal textures configure movement-spaces? In which way do they specify how circulations are to be monitored, channelled and held in check in order to be maintained? How do legal regulations discriminate between what is supposed to circulate and what not?",

The main aim was to make quarantine the object of international agreements in order to minimise impediments of commerce during a period sometimes referred to as a \u2018second wave of globalisation\u2019 (Robertson 2003).3 This concern led to the first International Sanitary Conference in 1851. Although the participants failed to agree on quarantine regulations at the first meeting in Paris, ten further conferences were to follow until 1903, most of them seeking to balance measures to prevent the spread of yellow fever and cholera against restrictions on travel, the disruption of trade and especially the costly immobilisation of ships (Howard-Jones 1975: 11).",

The IHR thus follow earlier attempts at global health by situating themselves within a planetary horizon, putting forward a trans-border vision of the Earth.

What is the \u2018historic individuality\u2019 of the current attempt at dealing with pandemics as globally collective phenomena? To answer this question, it is necessary to understand how the IHR contain a remarkable modification of the biopolitics of liberal governmentality (Lemke 2011). The IHR untie the complementary relation between the individual and the population outlined in the last section. On the one hand, they almost completely remove the question of individual health care from the preoccupation with circulatory matters. This is highly significant, since during the twentieth century a right to health became implemented not only in national jurisdictions, but also in key documents of international law such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 25) and the Preamble to the WHO\u2019s constitution. Yet, the IHR contain no substantial allusion to individual health, the figure of the individual person who is sick and needs care is, for the most part, absent. On the other hand, and even more curiously, the IHR also refrain from concerning themselves with the health of the population. While the figure of the population still featured prominently in the global health politics in the second half of the twentieth century, the IHR do not make a prominent reference to it. The IHR appear as an example of what Niamh Stephenson (2011: 621) or Andrew Lakoff (2008) have observed as a more general political trend: that the population ceases, increasingly, to be the main object of public health. Although not being completely absent, it appears only marginally in the IHR. This raises the question of what has come to substitute the dual structure of the individual body and the population in public health: What is put at risk by epidemic disease?",

Since viral traffic \u2014 broadly defined as \u2018movements of viruses to new species or new individuals\u2019 (Morse 1990: 82) \u2014 is always bound up with patterns of human traffic, Morse calls for \u2018viral traffic planning\u2019 (ibid.: 83): \u2018Basically, people are creating much [\u2026] of the traffic [\u2026]. We need to recognise this and learn how to be better \u201ctraffic engineers\u201d.\u2019 (Morse 1992: 1327) Especially ecological changes in land use and demographic changes in population density produce a new quality of biosocial interrelatedness: \u2018No one is truly isolated and therefore impervious to microbial traffic.\u2019 (Ibid.: 1327) As to the IHR, the WHO seems to share this vision of global transportability: traffic appears as an almost universal frame for planetary circulation. Microbial traffic is intertwined firmly with the world traffic in trade and travel, since the latter constitutes a vehicle for the former. In turn, the IHR circumscribe a liberal regime of para-medical policing. They do not concentrate on healing bodies, but rather on regulating free movement.",

This focus displaces the medical concern for individual symptoms of disease. The individual symptom becomes only relevant in so far as it may refer to potential \u2018routes of transmission\u2019 (IHR, Annex 2). Whereas the symptom is a hermeneutical concept, based on the idea of interpreting signs of illness, transmission is a media concept with a postal structure that is both spatial and operative (Kr\u00e4mer 2008: 12\u20139, 138\u201347). In its simplest form, transmission involves a carrier that transfers a pathogen from one point to another (Wald 2008: 71\u20139). The IHR present a broad inventory of physical bodies that may act as potential carriers, covering the whole spectrum of humans, animals and inanimate matter. Disinfection, for example, is defined as the \u2018procedure whereby health measures are taken to control or kill infectious agents on a human or animal body surface or in or on baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and postal parcel\u2019 (Article 1). Everything that circulates can function as a carrier of transmission: faeces, food, water are mentioned in the same manner as human remains (IHR, Articles 18.2 and 22.1). If anything, not the human, but animals feature as crucial carriers of transmission. Especially insects are seen as \u2018vectors\u2019 of epidemics, since they \u2018transport an infectious agent that constitutes a public health risk\u2019 (IHR, Article 1).",

            "text": "These bodies of transmission belong to a governmental vision that pictures the world as a space of universal traffic and that focuses on routes and material means of global circulation. In order to grasp the peculiarity of this governmental view, it may be instructive to recall that issues of public health have been traditionally tied to what Robert Castel calls \u2018the social question\u2019. According to Castel (2003), the social question highlights the way in which a society \u2018experiences the enigma of its own cohesion\u2019 and the \u2018dangers of disintegration\u2019 (xix\u2013xx). The social question problematises the capacity \u2018to exist as a collectivity linked by relations of interdependency\u2019 (ibid.: xx). Reading the IHR, one might say that, the social question becomes less social and more transactional. The globe is imagined as a transactional sphere in which relations of interdependency are established through modes of transportation that involve organic and inorganic matters. While the danger of disintegration remains related to the threat of an international health emergency, the referent of this threat takes on a novel form. As outlined above, the threatened object is neither the body of the individual nor the collective body of a population. It is instead the very global movement of animate and inanimate entities across boundaries, which has to be protected against immanent threats. The management of public health risks is therefore concerned primarily with what Collier and Lakoff (2014) have identified as \u2018vital systems\u2019. It is attentive to those infrastructures, hubs and nodal points that \u2018operate\u2019 world traffic and realise global connectivities (Tellmann et al. 2012).",

In fact, the current preoccupation with circulatory processes in the field of global health security does not amount to a \u2018de-territorialized smooth space\u2019 of \u2018uncoded flows\u2019 (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 352\u2013423).

Accordingly, the IHR formulate a set of \u2018recommendations with respect to persons, baggage, cargo, containers, goods and postal parcels\u2019 (IHR, Article 18). Two of them in particular are designed for managing the risk of disease transmission: screening and quarantine. As will be elaborated in the following, both screening and quarantine implement spatial thresholds of \u2018social sorting\u2019 (Bowker and Star 2000) at which carriers of disease can be singled out. They form peculiar strategies of division and enclosure that rely on classifications of risky bodies. As such, they supplement the government of global circulation.

In order to control this potential for pathogen transport, airports in Hong Kong, China or Singapore had already installed cameras for infrared thermal screening during the SARS outbreak (Ong 2004). These apparatuses hold the promise of visualising threats within circulatory flux. They aim at the identification of sick bodies by scanning the temperature of travellers for fever in a supposedly non-invasive manner. Actually, the attempt to use infrared thermography to govern disease involves a range of problems. Leaving aside the flaws in camera instalment, the true body core temperature always differs from the cutaneous temperature, the latter depending on the body parts selected for measurement or the outdoor temperature; moreover, persons may also be infectious without developing any increase in body temperature (Mercer and Ring 2009; Nishiura and Kamiya 2011). Nonetheless, the absence of thermal screening devices at Canadian airports has, apparently, been a decisive factor, when the WHO issued a travel advisory for Toronto and other affected areas during the SARS outbreak (Van Wagner 2008: 1655). Since 2005, the IHR authorise the WHO to \u2018recommend\u2019 the application of mass screening devices in case of a \u2018public-health emergency of international concern\u2019 (IHR, Article 12). When the WHO declared the Influenza A H1N1 (the \u2018swine flu\u2019) virus a pandemic in 2009, entry and exit thermal screening measures were adopted at airports worldwide.",

            "text": "However, as a checkpoint technology, thermal screening also differs from traditional forms of border control. To begin with, thermal screening operates beyond the hermeneutics of confession (Salter 2007: 57\u20139). It does not want to know what the traveller has just bought or how long she will stay at her destination; the apparatus for temperature detection is neither interested in intentions nor does it test the narratives for credibility. It circumvents the moment of interrogation in its desire to \u2018know the fleshy body\u2019 (Amoore and Hall 2009: 448) as it moves within world traffic. If one were to speak about confession at all, thermal screening does not elicit confessions of the flesh but \u2018confessions by the flesh\u2019 (Adey 2009: 287). Amoore and Hall (2009) have recently described the use of backscatter X-ray devices at airports in terms of \u2018somatic probing [\u2026] at the border\u2019 (457), and this characterisation clearly applies to the practice of thermal screening as well. At the same time, and in contrast to passports or biometric control, thermal screening does not seek to authenticate a person. Instead of verifying a social identity, it addresses the body simply as a physical object (Schillmeier 2008: 183). By focussing on the bareness of biological life, the social person reverts to an organic entity. Social markers such as gender, religion or nationality do not matter for deciding if someone is eligible to move on or not. Of course, those forms of border control that operate through interrogation and authentication do not disappear. Rather, thermal screening works in tandem with them, enhancing the regime of \u2018vigilant visualities\u2019 (Amoore 2007) at the border through its medical design.",

This period was soon to be extended to 40 days, which explains the etymological roots of quarantine. Even though originally quarantine had been introduced as an alternative to simply deterring ships from landing, it was soon to be regarded as deleterious to commerce and travel. As outlined above, the International Sanitary Conferences from the nineteenth century were motivated by the aim of regulating quarantine in Europe.

Yet, in order to understand quarantine\u2019s role in the government of global circulation envisioned by the IHR, one has to consider how quarantine conjoins the spatial measure of containment with a temporal calculus. Quarantine reckons with the temporal lag that exists between infection and the visibility of symptoms. It operates on the indeterminacy of the body during the incubation period, that is, its potential for being a vector of contagion. Quarantine is, therefore, not so much about predicting what a body can become (Dillon 2007: 18), but simply about waiting for a determinable status to emerge. If biosecurity \u2018today names a set of political responses within globalisation that take the unpredictability of molecular life [\u2026] as their justification\u2019 (Braun 2007: 15), then quarantine constitutes a biosecurity technology that seeks to control the dynamism inherent in life (Hinchliffe and Bingham 2008: 1537) by containing mobile bodies. It takes bodies out of circulation temporarily and puts them at a distance to other bodies in order to see if they are actually contagious entities or not.",

As a study of the procedure established by the Singapore ministry of health in 2003 details, the \u2018components of contact tracing included the following: obtaining all patient movements during the symptomatic stage; identifying the persons who had contact with the patient during these movements; and instituting follow-up action on the contacts for a 10-day period.\u2019 (Ooi et al. 2005: 252) Starting from a map of movements, contact lists were to be created and a quarantine board had to decide on the basis of these lists about whom to quarantine.",

Both technologies implement mechanisms for identifying risky bodies, and they do so for the purpose of differentiating the safe against the potentially dangerous elements. Since these modes of classificatory sorting distinguish bodies that can pass from those that cannot, one might portray them in terms of territorial exclusion. However, it is important to note that they do not seek to secure a territory against threats coming from outside. Rather, according to the rationality of the IHR, they intend to moderate circulatory flows in their immanence.

Measures such as quarantine and screening thus deploy spatial means for temporal ends. They act on infection rates in order to slow down or delay the spread of disease (cf. Schlaich et al. 2012). Such efforts at manipulating circulation take into account both social and biological rhythms. In fact, the latter distinction loses its significance in favour of those material relations that produce frequencies of connectivity. Each body may be a point of contact and contagion is the prime mechanism to be reckoned with.",

This corpo-realism that is born out of a situation of emergency seems to have captured the imaginary of global health governance. The technologies of screening and quarantine correspond with the IHR\u2019s overall concern for the materialities of human and non-human traffic. While thermal screening addresses organic life in its physical properties, quarantine seeks to control any entity \u2014 animals, humans, conveyances or even buildings \u2014 that has been exposed to a contagious agent. As territorial strategies, they modulate the capacities of bodies to connect both by configuring their distance and their rhythm.",

            "text": "The findings presented in this article may inform the wider theoretical debate about how to conceive of contemporary political spaces. Within the last decade, spatial theorists have, to a large extent, relied on a binary matrix that opposes absolute to relational spaces, topographies to topologies, and territories to networks (Amin et al. 2003: 6). In order to evade the \u2018territorial trap\u2019 so famously identified by John Agnew (1994), one had to side conceptually with the relational topologies of networks, privileging the fluid over the fixed. Only recently inverse warnings about a \u2018non-territorial trap\u2019 (Jones 2009: 494) have re-emerged together with the efforts to integrate the different registers. The analysis presented here offers a contribution to this problematic. The nomosphere of global health security delineates a \u2018movement-space\u2019 (Thrift 2004) composed of mobile bodies that act as relational transmission media. Potential patterns of contagion emerge from the patterns of world traffic. On the one hand, this amounts to a \u2018topological landscape of embeddings and disembeddings\u2019 (Hinchliffe et al. 2013: 538) in which relations are conceived of in terms of intensities. Topographic distances matter less than the potential of a body to affect other bodies. At the same time, however, the extensive properties of relations remain salient. The bodily potential to affect and be affected is intertwined with topographical processes of diffusion and dissemination. Distances matter strongly. Yet, rather than being seen as fixed, they are conceived of as highly malleable. Territorial strategies seek to re-configure distances along with permeabilities, velocities and rhythms. The nomospheric investigation of global health security thus helps us understand how territorial strategies become imbricated in global topologies. Instead of opposing the territorial and the topological, it prompts the sociology of political space to think of territorial practices topologically.",

This article started with the suggestion that the diagnosis of SARS being the \u2018first post-Westphalian pathogen\u2019 belongs to a particular problematisation of governmental space. As Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard (1997: 1\u201317) has pointed out memorably, the suffix \u2018post\u2019 does not claim an absolute caesura. It much more indicates a transformation that remains indebted and tied to that which it transcends. Accordingly, this article has not presented a diagnosis about a neat transition from international politics to world politics (Walker 2010). In a way, one just has to look at the cartographic lines on world maps in order to register the persistence of the modern state form. Accordingly, the IHR do not simply bypass the state. They rather mobilise intergovernmental institutional backup for realigning the organisational capacities of states, thereby assembling a globally networked governance structure designed to control circulatory processes that harbour the potential for universal viral traffic.",

Within the framework of the modern nomos of the Earth, law and territory were coupled to achieve both Ordnung (order) and Ortung (location) for a defined political nation. This coupling seems to dissolve as soon as globalisation can be equated with \u2018global mobilisation\u2019 (Galli 2010: 114). The IHR as a global juridical document establish a different conjunction between law and territory: territory turns primarily into an ordering mechanism for bodies in movement. The nomos of global circulation enshrined in the IHR, therefore, resembles what legal theorist Cornelia Vismann (2012: 37), in a different context, has termed a \u2018nomadic nomos\u2019. Seen from the modernist angle, a nomadic nomos can certainly only be perceived as a paradox: a nomos without the localisation of order. Nonetheless, nomodicity might in fact be the political-juridical signature of the global age, in which \u2018global space forms itself through a universal immediacy of mediations\u2019 (Galli 2010: 113). But what happens to the political qualities formerly associated with the act of Ortung? The juridical-political laboratory of epidemic communicability simultaneously contains and hides how contemporary political collectivity is constituted spatially. Yet, as long as a life in communities of traffic does not count as a proper mode of political existence, the question about the location of a polity under conditions of intense globalisation remains to be answered.",
