            "text": "M. paratuberculosis is the causative pathogen of Johne\u2019s disease (JD) characterized by chronic gastroenteritis, diarrhea, weight loss and low milk yield in ruminants.1 While JD is a worldwide problem, its prevalence in the United States is estimated to be >90% in dairy herds,2 causing a combined loss of $200\u2013250 million to the US dairy industry.3,4 The financial losses are incurred due to premature culling of infected animals, decreased milk production, and increased somatic cell infiltration in milk.5,6 JD is a slowly progressing disease and can infect 38\u201340% of the herd before becoming symptomatic in a single animal.7,8 Currently there is no treatment for JD and controlling the disease progression by culling the infected animals is very expensive, whereas vaccination offers a reasonable alternative.9 Mycopar\u00ae (Boehringer Ingelheim) is an oil suspended, heat killed, whole cell vaccine licensed in the United States. However, Mycopar\u00ae fails to completely protect against JD10,11 and can cause severe inflammatory lesions at the site of injection.12 It also poses a health risk to vaccinators due to accidental inoculation, which leads to a chronic inflammatory reaction that potentially requires surgical intervention.13 Given the challenges to control JD with the current vaccine, we directed our efforts to develop a more effective and safe vaccine against JD using polyanhydride nanoparticles (PAN).",

Another important aspect of vaccine development against Mycobacterial infection is its capability to elicit a polyfunctional T cell response with simultaneous production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by T cells.14,15 To elicit robust immunity, antigens are often formulated with adjuvants to prolong their release and enhance their protective immunity. In this study, we used whole cell lysate and culture filtrate proteins encapsulated in biodegradable polyanhydride nanoparticles (adjuvant) that provide sustained release of M. paratuberculosis antigens by surface erosion.16 PAN-based vaccines (i.e., nanovaccines) have been shown to impart long lasting protective immunity against several infectious diseases including influenza, pneumonic plague, respiratory syncytial virus, and pneumonia, using pathogen-specific protein antigens.16\u201322",

In this study, a single, subcutaneous dose of nanovaccine in C57BL/6 mice was evaluated for protection against M. paratuberculosis JTC-1285 challenge in comparison to both inactivated and live vaccine candidates. The live vaccine candidate lipN, developed previously by our group, was constructed by knockout of a fatty acid lipase/esterase gene lipN from M. paratuberculosis K10. This gene was significantly upregulated in M. paratuberculosis shed in the cow feces, as revealed by transcriptional profiling.40 Also, lipN mutant was analyzed and found to be attenuated in mice as indicated by reduced histopathological lesions and colonization of the liver.41 Its protective efficacy has been observed in goats challenged by virulent M. paratuberculosis strain.42 The study was conducted in two phases, viz: Trial I and Trial II. In the trial I studies, the focus was on the safety of the nanovaccine formulations while in the trial II studies, the focus was on the efficacy of nanovaccine formulations (Fig. 1).",

Animals vaccinated with Mycopar\u00ae gradually developed an abscess at the injection site which progressed and persisted throughout the study (Supplemental Fig. 7). On the other hand, no lesions were observed in nanovaccine-immunized and live attenuated (lipN) vaccine immunized animals. At 6 weeks post-vaccination (WPV) and before any challenge, histopathology of vaccinated mice groups demonstrated lymphoid depletion in the spleens of animals immunized with the commercial vaccine, while minimal to moderate lymphocytic infiltration and granulomatous inflammation was observed in the livers of the rest of vaccinated animals regardless of formulation, which is indicative of induced immunity.

We assessed antigen specific, polyfunctional T cell responses by multi-parametric flow-cytometry. In this analysis, LipN vaccinated mice showed significantly higher percentage of double cytokine (IFN-\u03b3,TNF-\u03b1) and single cytokine (IFN-\u03b3) producing CD4+ T cells as well CD8+ T cells in comparison with both PBS and Mycopar\u00ae vaccinated animals (Fig. 3a, b).

Also, the PAN-Cf vaccinated animals exhibited significantly higher double (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) cytokine secreting CD8+ T cells in comparison with PBS vaccinated mice (Fig. 3b). Of note was the breadth of the polyfunctional CD8+ T cell response observed from mice immunized with PAN-Cf. In contrast to all the other treatment groups where the majority of the CD8+ T cells was dominated by IFN-\u03b3 secreting single positive cells, PAN-Cf vaccinated mice showed a broader profile of triple, double and single cytokine secreting CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3b).",

T cell responses for the Trial II/Vaccine efficacy study were evaluated by flow cytometry for which spleens from vaccinated mice were collected at 12 and 18 weeks post-challenge (WPC). At 12 WPC, multi-parametric flow cytometry analysis indicated that mice immunized with PAN-Cf elicited a significantly higher percent of antigen specific double cytokine (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1+) and single cytokine (IFN-\u03b3) producing CD8+ T cells compared with non-vaccinated and Mycopar\u00ae vaccinated mice (Fig. 4). In addition, PAN-Cf and Mycopar\u00ae-vaccinated animals also displayed low levels of triple cytokine secreting CD8+ T cells. Similar to the pre-challenge CD8+ T immune response, mice immunized with PAN-Cf showed a broader profile of cytokine secreting cells at 12 WPC (see pie chart in Fig. 3). The cumulative percentage of CD8+ T cells that were either triple, double or single cytokine secretors was also higher in animals vaccinated with PAN-Cf (total percentage of cells secreting cytokine; T = 6.23) in contrast to that in animals vaccinated with the other formulations, indicating the robustness of the induced CD8+ T cell response. Also, animals receiving PAN-Cf + Lysate showed significantly higher levels of double cytokine secreting (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) CD8+ T cells in comparison with animals that received PBS and significantly higher levels of double cytokine secreting (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) CD4+ T cells in comparison with animals receiving both PBS and Mycopar\u00ae.

Previous studies have shown that PANs can encapuslate a diverse array of biologics including subunit proteins, peptides, and antibiotics.17,35 Here we demonstrate that polyanhydride nanoparticles can encapsulate complex payloads such as M. paratuberculosis proteins (from whole cell lysates and culture filtrate) and induce effective immune responses in mice indicating that the immunogenicity of the encapsulated cargo is intact. This novel delivery approach to inactivated vaccine improve their efficacy but maintain their safety profile. The strategy of using M. paratuberculosis proteins in both encapsulated and soluble form enables primed (provided by the soluble protein) and sustained (provided by the nanoparticle-encapsulated protein) immune responses.16,33,48 Consistent with previous studies that examined the safety of inactivated vaccines (e.g., Mycopar\u00ae),47,49 we observed abscess-like lesions at the inoculation site in several mice vaccinated with Mycopar\u00ae (Supplemental Fig. 7). In contrast, no adverse injection site reactions were observed in PAN-vaccinated mice, clearly indicating their excellent safety profile. These results add to the body of literature on the minimal reacotogenicity of polyahydride nanovaccines, as demonstrated previously.36,50",

We hypothesize that protection can be attributed to a robust polyfunctional CD8+ T cell response, especially for the nanovaccine formulas. Recently, nano-peptide based adjuvant enhanced BCG primed immune response by induction of a robust polyfunctional CD8+ T cells.60 Overall, the presented analyses (Figs 3, 4) clearly indicated robust induction of polyfunctional T cell responses in mice immunized by the nanovaccines as depicted by higher triple and double cytokine producing CD8+ T cells when compared with non-vaccinated (PBS) and Mycopar\u00ae-vaccinated mice. It is noteworthy to mention here that for M. tuberculosis vaccines, polyfunctional T cells were mainly CD4+ unlike the predominantly CD8+ population observed in animals vaccinated with the PAN-Cf group. This is likely induced by the inclusion of polyanhydride nanoparticles in the PAN-Cf group, consistent with previous observations.61,62",

The robust polyfunctional T cell response observed in PAN-Cf vaccinated animals for 12 WPC may be attributed to sustained release of antigen from polyanhydride particles.29 Remarkably, PAN-Cf+ Lysate was able to produce double cytokine (IFN-\u03b3+IL-2+) CD4+ T cells significantly higher than PBS and Mycopar\u00ae and exhibited lower bacterial burden in all the mice tissues as compared with non-vaccinated mice (Fig. 6). Most importantly, PAN-Cf vaccinated mice had the lowest bacterial burden in three out of the four tissues evaluated. Moreover, despite this significant reduction was not maintained at 18 WPC, the level of polyfunctional T cells remained robust at this prolonged time. This indicates that several other paramters (beyond the scope of present study), such as Th-17 induction, tissue homing properties of T cells, memory and effector phenotype could also play critical roles.63,64 These parameters deserve more attention, especially as we advance vaccine testing to ruminant models.",

For example, granulomatous lesions that are typical of mycobacterial infection were seen in the liver of PBS and Mycopar\u00ae-vaccinated animals in higher frequency than in the lipN or PAN-vaccinated animals (Table 1), consistent with the levels of mycobacterial colonization. Similar to other vaccine candidates (lipN mutant), PAN-based vaccines were able to significantly lower M. paratuberculosis levels in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes but did not prevent dissemination of infection. Approaches focused on developing significant mucosal immunity at the main site of M. paratuberculosis entry (intestine) could definitely reduce organ dissemination of the infection. Overall, the nanovaccines and lipN mutant were able to impart superior protective imunity against M. paratuberculosis challenge in mice compared with a commercial vaccine, Mycopar\u00ae. Further, in contrast to Mycopar\u00ae, nanovaccines were also well tolerated and did not induce any adverse reactions at the site of injection. Both these features makes PAN nanovaccines ideal for further testing in larger animals such as goats and cattle following mucosal immunization and oral infections, to memic natural infection. Although promising, nanovaccines have room for improvement before becoming suitable for field applications. For example, methods to improve the encapsulation efficiency of complex protein mixtures like whole cell lysate into PAN are highly desirable and if developed, could improve vaccine production and facilitate immunization. Such strategies could open the door for the development of more effective vaccines targeting other intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis.",

All procedures were in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Wisconsin, Madison. Experiments were run in two trials (Table 2, n = 15/group) with trials I and II comprising of four and six vaccine groups, respectively. Animals were vaccinated subcutaneously as per the experimental design shown in Table 2. In all experiments, five mice from each group were sacrificed at 6 weeks post-vaccination. The remaining 10 animals in each group were challenged with 108 CFU of M. paratuberculosis JTC-1285 in 100 \u03bcL of PBS, injected intraperitoneally (IP). The subcutaneous vaccination regime and intraperitoneal challenge model has been successfully employed before in mouse models and the resulting data translated well to ruminant systems such as in goats.42,69,70 The dose was confirmed by plating the serially diluted challenge inoculums on 7H10 plates. Mice were monitored daily for adverse reaction(s) from vaccination and for the progression of infection. At 6 weeks (Trial I), 12 weeks (Trials I and II) and 18 weeks (Trial II) post-challenge, mice (n = 5) were sacrificed and the liver, spleen, small intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested from each sacrificed mouse in order to quantify the bacterial burden. Organs were homogenized in 1 mL PBS and undiluted and 10-fold serial diluted samples were plated onto antibiotic free and selective media (hygromycin 30 \u03bcg/mL) to differentiate between lipN and challenge strain. When the selective media were not used, organs were plated onto standard 7H10 plates supplemented with ADC, mycobactin-J, and vancomycin (5 mg/mL), amphotericin B (30 mg/mL), and nalidixic acid (10 mg/mL) to reduce bacterial and fungal contamination. Finally, tissue sections were collected for histopathology and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.41 Slides were scored by a trained pathologist blinded to the samples. The animal experimental design is shown in Fig. 1.",
