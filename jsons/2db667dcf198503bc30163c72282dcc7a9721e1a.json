Third, the pandemic caused a sudden need to treat a large number of patients in hospitals requiring an extraordinarily large ICU capacity, particularly with an enormous need for certain medical devices particularly ventilator capacity (e.g. UK ventilator challenge [12] ) by far exceeding the currently available capacity in many hospitals and countries. Fourth, the pandemic has called for a need of digital innovation, including epidemic modelling to monitor and understand the spread and development of the virus across populations, including tracking of cases and spreaders. Fifth, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an exceptional high demand for skilled medical staff, doctors and nurses, particularly with ICU experience, such as anaesthetists and critical care nurses, all of whom need to be equipped with PPE (personal protective equipment), in this pandemic particularly protective clothing, face shields, goggles, gloves to protect health care staff from infection.",

Also, the securing of food supply (chains) with supermarket chains play a major role, including the optimisation of delivery route planning, quick adjustments to online booking systems, e.g. rationing certain goods or prioritising delivery slots to the elderly and vulnerable. Other challenges then relate to the Information Technology (IT) and infrastructure for connecting all the people suddenly trying to work at home, i.e. video conferencing platforms and equipment (e.g. Google and Microsoft announced free access to their advanced teleconferencing and collaboration tools [13] as well as internet service providers relieving data caps [14] ).

Focusing on preventative digital innovation, scientists have focused more on open data platforms, by developing epidemiological models to understand government responses and forecast the growth curves of the virus [31] , analysing geospatial models to understand the distribution and spread of the virus [32] , and deploying causaleffect models to understand symptoms of the virus and limit its spread through behavioural science, and tracking applications [33] . In the diagnostic sphere, scientists utilise AI, and more specifically Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to detect COVID-19 from X-Ray Images. This has also been particularly useful in diagnostic analysis of symptoms to predict the development of a patient's case [34] . A high number of efforts have also been concentrated on treatments, where scientists have developed AI text and data mining tools to help the medical community develop answers to high priority scientific questions and potential treatments. Efforts have focused on the development and summarisation of genome specific medical protocols of precision medicine and host response, as well as modelling and simulation of the virus propagation and efficiency of interventions [35] .",

The first category is prevention, including digital innovations to track the virus spread, sanitisers, PPE equipment etc in order to slow down the spread of the virus, but also vaccines to control future outbreaks which are currently under development. The second category is diagnostics predominantly including the need for an incredible volume of testing kits, and those that are accurate, but also portable and deliver speedy results, recently also antibody tests. The third category is treatment, including development of treatments through repurposing or existing drugs, development of new antiviral drugs, but also ventilators for ICU critical care in hospitals around the world. Those three categories are used throughout the remainder of this paper.",

Many of those IP intensive sectors are of particular relevance in today's unfolding pandemic. For instance, ventilators are typically expensive medical devices and the incumbent manufacturing companies are likely to own alive / active (i.e. not yet expired) CC-IP, PPE equipment (e.g. face masks) being fairly 'low tech', with a high probability that formally relevant CC-IP has expired.",

            "text": "While IP issues have hardly surfaced during the beginning of this pandemic, this has happened quite recently. A few examples are summarised below. The Wellcome Trust appears to be among the first prominent organisations that understood the relevance of IP for this pandemic early on [36] . With a particular focus on research, on January 31, 2020, the trust called for journals, publishers etc. to allow widespread sharing of all potentially relevant research and dataset. This initiative is geared towards publishers to not put any COVID-19 relevant publications behind a paywall. The pledge seems to be a huge success as a wide range of renowned organisations have now signed up to it, including leading journals, such as Nature and The Lancet, but also the European Commission, publishers (e.g. Cambridge University Press), national academies of science (e.g. Academy of Medical Sciences, The Royal Society), foundations (e.g. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), research councils (e.g. UK Medical Research Council), ministries (e.g. Indian Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology) and a wide range of other organisations, including companies (e.g. BenevolentAI, Johnson & Johnson). By now more than 24,000 research papers are available online [37] . In the past weeks some other organisations have started raising concerns that IP might be an issue during the pandemic and have called for the government and private sector to respond. For instance, on March 27, 2020, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) publicly announced their concern that firms might try to profiteer from the crisis [38] and the government of Costa Rica called the WHO to organise the pooling of relevant IP [39] . By now, a few governments have passed compulsory license resolutions for CC-IP, e.g. Chile and Canada [40] and some even authorized issuance of compulsory license e.g. Israel's compulsory licensing for Kaletra [41] . Compulsory licensing schemes are typically some kind of \"last resort\" government measures.",

            "text": "One of the main IP challenges, both in this pandemic, and in general is the availability of open data for analysing the progression of the virus [55] , as well as the different analysis types deployed [56] . In an outbreak so severe as the COVID-19, where the reported cases to this moment are close to 1 million worldwide, any available dataset is potentially helpful to derive insights into the disease. We perform an ad-hoc patent analysis for coronaviruses using an open dataset by Lens.org 1 , to enhance our understanding into preventive, diagnostic and treatment measures for the virus. We focus on the broader spectrum of coronaviruses to identify patterns from earlier outbreaks that could be applied in the case of COVID-19. Table  1 shows the descriptive statistics and correlations for the patent dataset and Fig.2 shows some initial results from the Coronavirus Patent Analysis. Fig. 2a shows the top 10 CPC classification distribution at the subgroup level. It is evident that the highest number of patents belonging to the primary CPC subgroup classification are in C07K14/005. This is the organic chemistry subclass, for peptides with more than 20 amino acids and specifically for viruses, which constitute viral proteins. This is followed by the subgroups A61K39/215 (medicinal preparations containing antigens or antibodies materials for immunoassay for coronavirus) and C12Q1/701 (measuring or testing processes involving enzymes, nucleic acids or microorganisms involving virus specific hybridization probes). These are followed by C12N7/00 (preparation of viruses bacteriophages compositions, medicinal viral antigen or antibody compositions), G01N1 (investigation processes for measuring or testing other than immunoassay, involving enzymes), C07K16/08 (investigation of immunoglobulins from RNA viruses). Within the top 10 classes, we also find a subclass within section Y (Emerging Cross-Sectional Technology), with Y02A50/451, which is specific for genetic or molecular screening of pathogens. This indicates that within the granted patents, there are some vaccination related patents available. All the top 10 CPC classifications have to do specifically with the chemical characteristics of the virus for prevention, diagnostics and treatment. Also, one could note that granularity of patent applications in these fields since some of these have 50 CPC subgroups. Fig. 2b shows the top 10 IPC classification distribution at the subgroup level. There are 103 unique subgroups referenced within these patents. While the highest primary IPC sub group is A61K39/215 (preparation for medical purposes devices or methods specially adapted for bringing pharmaceutical products into particular physical or administering forms chemical aspects of, or use of materials for deodorisation of air, for disinfection or sterilisation, or for bandages, dressings, absorbent pads or surgical articles soap compositions for coronavirus), the highest collective number is for the subgroup, C12N15/09 (microorganisms or enzymes compositions thereof propagating, preserving or maintaining microorganisms mutation or genetic engineering culture media microbiological testing media recombinant DNA-technology).",

The rest of the subclasses fall within the C12 class, where viruses, undifferentiated human, animal or plant cells, protozoa, tissues and unicellular algae are considered as microorganisms. From both Fig.2a and Fig.2b , it appears evident that the highest clusters of patents are around the chemical process of identification, composition and vaccine development for the coronavirus family. Fig.2d shows the distribution of the granted patents within different jurisdictions. Immediately, evident is that the granted patents are lagging behind the patent applications. There are some old granted patents that fall within the broad spectrum of the analysis in 1975 about the development of vaccines, however patent applications before 1975 are not included in the dataset. The majority of patent applications are filled in the US, followed by the transition to WO under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). These are followed by AU, CN, EP, CA, KO and JP. The distribution of granted patents follows an upwards trend (greater rate of increase than that of patent applications), but with significantly lower numbers (with the peak around 120 granted patents in 2019 relative to an average of 300 patent applications from Fig.2c ). The distribution of these granted patents within the different jurisdictions are US, EP, AU, CN, KO, RU, and JP. It is also interesting to note that the conversion rate of patent applications to granted patents is 32%. ",

In this 'new normal', our analysis about the IP related considerations that arise during the efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic identifies scenarios with IP relevance involving four main stakeholder groups shown in Our analysis finds that during the COVID-19 pandemic a range of non-Crisis-Critical Product (CC-Product) manufacturers entered Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), in which incumbent manufacturers have developed, produced and supplied Crisis-Critical Products (CC-Products) already before the pandemic. Those existing firms had insufficient production capacities to supply Crisis-Critical Products (CC-Products) in the huge quantities needed in a timely manner, leading to supply shortages for customers. Firms from non-Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), such as 3D printing, automotive, aerospace, home appliances, fashion and luxury goods, rushed into CC-Sectors to help cope with the CC-Product supply shortages Table 2 provides an overview of the IP related considerations for COVID-19 (with examples) distinguishing (i) the prevention of COVID-19 (including measures to limit its spread and vaccines to prevent future outbreak), the (ii) diagnostics (including professional and self-testing) and (iii) treatment, with the latter including the direct treatments (e.g. development of drugs) but also the treatment of symptoms, i.e. related to the medical equipment needed to keep bodies alive (e.g. ventilators, ICU beds).",

First, we label firms as 'incumbents' that already operated in CC-Sectors before the start of the pandemic developing, manufacturing and supplying CC-Products. These incumbents are highly likely to own CC-IP when a pandemic starts. Second, we label those organisations 'new entrants' that suddenly rush to enter the CC-Sectors after the beginning of a pandemic in order to support scaling up the development and manufacturing of CC-Products. New entrants can be industrial manufacturing firms (Type 1), but also voluntary grassroot initiatives, including not-for-profit communities, start-ups, entrepreneurial scientists, etc (Type 2). While manufacturing firms entering CC-Sectors are highly likely to own IP, this might not be relevant CC-IP. In contrast, voluntary grassroot initiatives typically do not own formal IP prior to a pandemic as these only form during a pandemic. Based on that distinction we identify three broad scenarios that are discussed below.",

These firms then become new entrants into CC-Sectors. There appears to be four kinds of new entrants that suddenly rush to help with producing CC-Products by repurposing their production lines.",

However, new entrants choosing this option might become future targets for infringement claims from incumbents once the pandemic has ended.

Other efforts are being led by coalitions of large technology consultancies such as Cambridge Consultants, who typically work on medical device projects for clients but without holding their own IP [96] . However, starting from the ground up might not be the most efficient way to achieve impact during a pandemic as developing and obtaining medical approval for new CC-Product designs is likely to cause further delays.

These companies can then grant licenses and share CC-IP with consortium partners, including new entrants. Other incumbents, e.g. Medtronic, selectively pledged CC-IP for their Puritan BennettTM 560 -a basic ventilator model for which they have made available all designs and manufacturing details under a permissive license for a limited term [50] . For new entrants to access CC-IP this way is a way to avoid infringing existing IP owned by incumbents. For incumbents to pledge CC-IP is a way to facilitate the adoption of their technology during the pandemic, potentially with some lasting benefits beyond the pandemic.

Overall, large firms might be more at risk to become targets for future (i.e. after the pandemic) infringement claims than SMEs and voluntary initiatives. A particular consideration that should be mentioned is that while rushing into CC-Product manufacturing large firms may not perceive IP to be that urgent given a current crisis, which could turn out to be difficult in the long run as this could come with considerable IP risks. Incumbent owners of CC-IP might have a lower probability to sue voluntary initiatives, because they cannot claim damages, so could only ask for injunctions, which may cause themselves reputational damages. An exception might be the case of a CC-Product developed by a voluntary initiative, which is then produced in large volumes. However, a voluntary initiative giving away its IP open source would not make sufficient money to be a damage claim target. Rather those manufacturing an open source design without a clean freedom to operate situation could be targets for infringement claims. One also has to consider that new entrants, whether large manufacturing firms or voluntary initiatives, are likely to develop novel CC-IP during a pandemic, which they could use when continuing to stay in CC-Sectors.",

Patent protection for different forms of coronavirus already exist but not for the particular coronavirus type, SARS-CoV-2 that causes the COVID-19 disease. It is also evident that there is a time-lag between the outbreak and the materialisation of patents, and high number of citations to Non-Patent Literature, which shows the urgency of scientists for open data to put the information in the public domain.",

These new entrants can be manufacturing firms that have not produced Crisis-Critical Products prior to a pandemic, but also voluntary grassroot initiatives, start-ups, entrepreneurial scientists, etc.",

In the second scenario we discuss IP considerations when voluntary grassroot initiatives enter Crisis-Critical Sectors. In the third scenario we discuss R&D and manufacturing engagements and IP considerations for the incumbents in the CC-Sectors. We finally provide an initial discussion of three possible approaches to address IP concerns during a pandemic, namely compulsory licensing, IP pledges and IP pooling.",
