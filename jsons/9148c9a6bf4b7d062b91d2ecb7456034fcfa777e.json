Immunomodulatory therapy to down-regulate the cytokine storm may provide insights into the treatment of COVID-19. Combined use of an immunomodulatory agentto reduce the cytokine stormwith an antiviral agent may give physicians more time to provide supportive treatment for patients with Corticosteroids are among the most commonly used drugs for immunomodulatory therapy of infectious diseases. However, the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 can cause host immune suppression and delay viral clearance. Recent study results have provided information to help handle this dilemma. A study at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University found that the use of corticosteroids did not influence viral clearance time, length of hospital stay or duration of symptoms in patients with mild COVID-19 [5] . This study, which included 201 patients with COVID-19, found that treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.72) among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Based on these findings, the use of corticosteroids is considered beneficial in severe cases of COVID-19 (especially in partients with ARDS), but not in mild cases [6] . According to treatment experiences in China, cautious use of corticosteroids is only recommended in certain critically ill patients (e.g. those with hypoxaemia) at low-to-moderate doses (no more than 1-2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or equivalent) for a short duration (3-5 days), as stated in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 860, "end": 863, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1280, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "issued by the National Health Commission of China [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 50, "end": 53, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Recently, chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have been used in the treatment of COVID-19.

In addition to their antimalarial and antiviral effects, their anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can inhibit major histocompatibility complex class II expression, antigen presentation and immune activation (reducing CD154 expression by T cells) via Toll-like receptor signalling and cGAS stimulation of interferon genes [11] . Thus, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can reduce the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, interferon-\u03b1 and tumour necrosis factor, which are involved in the cytokine storm [11] .

Tocilizumab is a good therapeutic option for cytokine release syndrome in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy. However, clinical experience with tocilizumab in viral disease is very limited. In a retrospective study on patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis infected with influenza A, reduced fever and a reduced level of C-reactive protein were observed in patients who received tocilizumab compared with patients who did not receive tocilizumab [16] . Meanwhile, IL-6 inhibition by tocilizumab did not exacerbate or increase susceptibility to influenza virus infection [16] .
