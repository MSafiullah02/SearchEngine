            "text": "INTRODUCTION Viral infections are a common precipitant of acute wheezing and asthma exacerbations in children. Many respiratory viruses have been associated with acute wheezing, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and enteroviruses [Johnston et al., 1995; Taussig et al., 2003; Wilson, 2003; Jartti et al., 2004; Tan, 2004; Kusel et al., 2006] . Recently human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [van den Hoogen et al., 2001] , human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV NL63) [Fouchier et al., 2004; van der Hoek et al., 2004] and human bocavirus (HBoV) [Allander et al., 2005] have been described. The importance of these respiratory viruses as a trigger of acute wheezing episodes has not been well studied in African children. Jartti et al. [2002] first showed that hMPV may cause acute wheezing in young children. Subsequently other investigators have confirmed a significant association between hMPV infection and wheezing in young children, particularly in winter [Schildgen et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2007] . There is relatively little information on the importance of HCoV NL63 and HBoV as a trigger of acute wheezing and no information on the prevalence of these in African children. Studies from developed countries have reported that children infected with HCoV NL63 and HBoV may present with symptoms of wheezing [Arden et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005; Moes et al., 2005; Foulongne et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Allander et al., 2007] .",

Novel respiratory viruses were detected mainly in the autumn or winter seasons (28/44, 63.6%) when 9/20 (45%) hMPV, 3/6 (50%) HCoV NL63, and 16/18 (88.8%) HBoV isolates were identified ( Fig. 2A-D) .",

Further, two samples, ZA169-05 and ZA185-05, formed a new subgrouping within lineage A, A3, with high bootstrap values. No apparent lineage was more prevalent during the winter or summer months. During 2004 only hMPV lineage B was detected, while in 2005 isolates from the A lineage were more frequently detected (7/11). Limited sequence data is available for HCoV NL63 with ZA85-05 most closely related to the prototype strains, HCoV NL63 and HCoV NL, of lineage A and ZA08-04 grouped with lineage B (Fig. 3B ). All HBoV positive samples clustered with HBoV strain st2 (Fig. 3C) . common novel virus followed by HBoV and HCoV NL63. For comparison, in the subset of samples that were also tested for the other common respiratory viruses, 25% were positive. The viral detection rate was lower than reported in other studies where viruses have been found in up to 90% of cases [Jartti et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2005; Allander et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2007; Ong et al., 2007] . A number of factors may account for this including patient selection, methodology of viral detection, storage of samples, use of a subset for detection of common viruses and lack of testing for additional respiratory viruses such as rhinoviruses, CMV, other coronaviruses or picornaviruses. Due to resource limitations, only a subset of specimens could be tested for a limited number of respiratory viruses. Further children with relatively mild illness were studied, which may also account for lower rates of viral identification as infection rates have been reported to be higher in wheezing children requiring hospitalization compared to an ambulatory population [Rakes et al., 1999; Thumerelle et al., 2003; Heymann et al., 2005] . Nevertheless, our study indicates that respiratory viruses, including the novel viruses, are an important trigger of acute wheezing in young children. Furthermore, this is the first report of the incidence of novel viruses in African children with wheezing.",

HBoV infections were predominately (72%) found in the winter months, a finding confirmed by other studies [Smuts and Hardie, 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006a] . The lack of seasonality for HCoV NL63 may be due to the small number of isolates or may indicate true lack of a seasonal trend.",

            "text": "Phylogenetic analysis showed co-circulation of both A and B lineages of hMPV and HCoV NL63. Neither lineage was associated with a different spectrum of symptoms or age prevalence. There was a cyclical nature to the appearance of the various hMPV lineages. In 2004 only B1 and B2 sublineages were detected while from early 2005 lineage A became more prevalent. In Cape Town the hMPV lineages circulating in young children have been monitored over a 5-year period. In 2001 only A1 was detected; in 2002 and 2003 A1 and B2 were found; 2004 the predominant sublineage was B1 and to a lesser extent B2 while in 2005 sublineage A1, A2, A3, and B1 were detected [Smuts et al., 2004 and unpublished data] . A study undertaken in Johannesburg, South Africa from 2000 to 2002 showed similar but slightly different circulation patterns [Ludewick et al., 2005] . This complex pattern of co-circulation may be related to pre-existing immunity in the general population to one or more sublineages allowing the emergence of a different sublineage with a changed antigenic profile. These changes in the dominant virus lineage have also been reported in respiratory viruses like RSV [Peret et al., 2000; Venter et al., 2001] . The identification of a novel sublineage of lineage A in this study, has also been observed by Huck et al. [2006] who reported an increased divergence of lineage A. HBoV is a highly conserved virus and thus sequence analysis of the more variable capsid gene allowed for the phylogenetic differentiation of strains. In this study all HBoV isolates were closely related to st2.",
