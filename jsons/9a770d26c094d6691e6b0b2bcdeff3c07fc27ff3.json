Dynamical systems interpretations, apply only under the above assumption. Conclusion The analysis suggests that fitting COVID-19 cumulative cases N to an equation of the form = ( ) gives insight into the progression pandemic in different regions. As is essentially the number of cases reported each day, the function F(N) can be easily plotted. Since ( ) = (ln ), this quantity can be readily ascertained from logarithmic plots of the cumulative number The variation of F(N) with N depicts the progression towards stabilization of the cumulative number. If F(N ) approaches N-axis with negative slope, indication is that the equilibrium point NE within reach. This tendency is visible majority of the curves presented -most probably a signature of success of the containment measures. More information about evolution of the pandemic could follow on updating of the plots.",
