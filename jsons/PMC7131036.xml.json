Amantadine (Symmetrel) and rimantadine (Flumadine) are symmetric tricyclic amines that specifically inhibit the replication of influenza A viruses at low concentrations (<1.0 \u03bcg/mL) by blocking the action of this M2 protein.9, 10, 11 When used against susceptible strains, both agents are 70% to 90% effective in preventing infection and reduce duration of fever and symptoms when used for treatment.12, 13, 14 Although this class of drugs is specifically indicated for the prevention and treatment of influenza A infections, widespread resistance to all M2 inhibitors has been documented in circulating influenza A strains, and this class of agents is not currently recommended for the prevention or treatment of influenza.15 Cross-resistance to both agents occurs as the result of single amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane portion of the M2 protein.11 The resistant virus seems to retain wild-type pathogenicity and causes an influenza illness indistinguishable from that caused by susceptible strains.",

In adults, the usual dose for treatment or prevention of influenza A infection is 100 mg every 12 hours for both drugs. Amantadine is excreted unchanged by the kidney, whereas rimantadine undergoes extensive metabolism by the liver before being excreted by the kidney; as a result, dose adjustment with renal dysfunction is required. The most common side effects of the M2 inhibitors are minor central nervous system complaints (anxiety, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, dizziness, headache, and jitteriness) and gastrointestinal upset, which are particularly prominent in the elderly and those with renal failure.17 Patients who receive amantadine may develop antimuscarinic effects, orthostatic hypotension, and congestive heart failure. Rates of adverse effects are lower for rimantadine than amantadine.17, 19 Given drug-drug interactions, care should be used when coadministering either agent with antihistamines or anticholinergic drugs, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, triamterene-hydrochlorothiazide, quinine, quinidine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antidepressants, and minor tranquilizers.20\n",

Viral replication in the lower airway does not correlate with quantity or duration of replication in the upper airway. Doubling the treatment dose of oseltamivir in hospitalized patients with influenza does not seem to increase virologic efficacy, except perhaps for influenza B infections, or clinical effectiveness, although one ICU-based randomized controlled trial reported that tripling the standard dose was associated with acceleration of viral RNA clearance from the respiratory tract.47, 48, 49 Doses of oseltamivir should be given after hemodialysis; dosing must be adjusted for renal insufficiency and renal replacement therapy (see Table 1). There are conflicting data about optimal dosing of oseltamivir in pregnant women, with some studies suggesting a need for higher doses (75 mg 3 times a day), whereas others suggest that no dose adjustment is needed.50, 51, 52 Current guidelines recommend treating pregnant women with influenza infection with one of the approved neuraminidase inhibitors.

Oseltamivir is associated with nausea; abdominal discomfort; and, less often, emesis in a minority of treated patients, but this can be ameliorated by giving food with each dose. Other infrequent possible adverse events include insomnia, vertigo, and fever. Postmarketing reports suggest that oseltamivir may be associated, rarely, with skin rash, hepatic dysfunction, or thrombocytopenia. In addition, there have been reports of abnormal neurologic and behavioral symptoms that have, rarely, resulted in deaths, mostly among children; most of these reports have come from Japan. Existing data suggest that these events are more likely secondary to influenza infections than oseltamivir therapy.53, 54 It is currently recommended that patients be monitored closely for behavioral abnormalities.",

            "text": "Peramivir has also been investigated in several studies in hospitalized adults and children but is not specifically approved for this indication. In all studies, multiple doses of peramivir were used and findings suggest that single-dose therapy is not appropriate for severely ill patients. The first study, conducted in Japan, randomized 37 high-risk patients (those with diabetes or chronic respiratory tract diseases or patients being treated with drugs that suppress immune function) to receive 300 mg or 600 mg of peramivir daily with the duration of treatment (1\u20135 days) based on clinical improvement, defined as resolution of fever or judgment by the principal investigator or subinvestigator that continued administration was unnecessary.60 The median durations of influenza symptoms were 114.4 hours in the 300-mg group and 42.3 hours in the 600-mg group (hazard ratio [90% confidence interval], 0.497 [0.251\u20130.984]) with a similar trend in time to resolution of fever. All subsequent studies have been larger, randomized, multinational studies. In the phase 2 study, 5 days of 200 mg or 400 mg of peramivir every day was compared with oral oseltamivir 75 mg twice a day in hospitalized adults. There was a trend toward more rapid resumption of usual activities in peramivir-treated patients and greater reductions of influenza B viral titers in the nasopharynx than oseltamivir over the first 48 hours.61 A phase 3 multidose regimen was an open-label, multinational, randomized study that was started during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic (October 2009 to October 2010), and was designed to compare the safety and tolerability of 2 dosing regimens of peramivir in hospitalized patients.62 Two-hundred and thirty-four patients were randomized to receive 5 days of 300 mg of peramivir twice daily or 600 mg of peramivir once daily. The overall time to clinical resolution (TTCR) was 92 hours in the intent-to-treat infected (ITTI) group with a median time of 42 hours in the 300-mg group and 166 hours in the 600-mg group. The subjects on the 600-mg regimen ITTI analysis were noted to have higher need for supplemental oxygen at randomization, higher baseline APACHE score, and higher need for ICU admission before randomization than the subjects randomized to the 300-mg regimen, and multivariate analysis showed that the difference in TTCR between groups could be explained by differences in severity of illness before randomization. Virologic response, as measured by time-weighted change in virus titer from baseline to 48 hours, was \u22121.51 TCID50 (Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose)/mL without significant difference between the two doses (P = .65). In addition, no treatment differences were seen in the percentage of subjects who remained culture positive or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positive at 48, 72, and 96 hours postenrolment. The second phase III study was a double-blind, randomized trail conducted between September 2009 and November 2012 and enrolled 338 patients.63 Patients were randomized to receive peramivir or standard of care in a 2:1 ratio. Only 121 patients had confirmed influenza and did not receive an NAI (neuraminidase inhibitor) as part of Standard of Care (SOC) (ITTI\u2013non-NAI group) and were randomized to placebo (n = 43) or peramivir (n = 78) and 217 patients with confirmed influenza received NAI as part of SOC (ITTI-NAI group) and were randomized to placebo (n = 73) or peramivir (n = 144). Of note, there were important differences between the ITTI\u2013non-NAI group and the ITTI-NAI group, namely lower mean body mass index (24.7 vs 29.1 kg/m2) and lower influenza vaccination rate (5% vs 23%) in the ITTI\u2013non-NAI group. In addition, the non-NAI SOC subjects had shorter symptom duration (32% vs 48% symptoms >48 hours), and were less likely to smoke (13% vs 23%), have abnormal chest radiographs at baseline (27% vs 45%), require supplemental oxygen (26% vs 36%), or have measurable virus titers at baseline (31% vs 50%). The study was terminated for futility after interim analysis. Peramivir-treated subjects in the non-NAI SOC population showed a modest, but not statically significant (P = .97), improvement in TTCR compared with subjects receiving SOC alone (42.5 vs 49.5 hours), with similar results observed in the NAI SOC population (peramivir vs placebo, 41.8 vs 48.9 hours; P = .74).",

Median time to resolution of fever was 20.6 hours, time to resolution of symptoms was 29.1 hours, and 92.9% had viral clearance by day 6 of treatment. Of note, TTCR in this pediatric study was shorter than the time noted in the adult trials. Taken together, these results suggest that intravenous peramivir likely has similar efficacy to oral oseltamivir and can be considered as an alternative to oral therapy in patients who cannot take oral therapy or in whom oral absorption is in question.",

Likewise, the combination of oseltamivir and nitazoxanide has been studied; at the time of writing, the study is complete but results have not been made public (NCT01610245). Despite their theoretic benefits, the optimal use of combination therapy is still under investigation.95 Similarly, combinations of therapy, typically ribavirin plus antibody preparations, have also been studied for the treatment of RSV and parainfluenza virus in immunocompromised patients. For RSV, the lowest rate of progression to lower tract disease and lowest mortality has been observed with the combination of aerosolized ribavirin and an antibody preparation (either RSV immunoglobulin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or palivizumab).84\n",
