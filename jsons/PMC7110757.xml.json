Biosecurity comprises two components, namely, bioexclusion and biocontainment. Bioexclusion relates to preventive measures (risk reduction strategies) designed to avoid the introduction of pathogenic infections (hazards), whereas biocontainment relates to measures to limit within-farm transmission of infectious hazards and onward spread to other farms.",

Therefore, farmers need to be motivated to both change existing behaviours and to continue to implement effective practices to avoid biosecurity breakdowns (Truyers et al., 2011). However, currently there is a lack of consensus internationally in the published literature regarding bioexclusion protocols (Daly, 2011, Moore et al., 2008), their efficacy (Van Winden et al., 2005, Faust et al., 2001) and their cost-effectiveness. These barriers may explain the slow adoption of such practices by many farmers (Gunn et al., 2008, Heffernan et al., 2008, Moore et al., 2008).",

The review focuses on routes of transmission, the risks associated with introduction of infection and how these risks can be reduced through bioexclusion. An empirical hierarchy of risks has been established from the published literature, cognisant of the fact that the relative importance of each risk varies with the disease. Added animals (either purchased or hired, and reintroduced resident cattle) and contiguous cattle represent the highest biosecurity risks, in that order of risk ranking (Van Winden et al., 2005, Lindberg and Alenius, 1999).",

Farming practices, such as hiring a bull and returning it after the breeding season, significantly increase the risk of entry of venereally-transmitted infections such as bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and leptospirosis (Bishop et al., 2010, Sibley, 2010, Bazeley, 2011). The asymmetry of information between vendor and purchaser about seller herd health status may result in cattle for sale, particularly in markets (Chi et al., 2002a) with a higher prevalence of disease than in the general cattle population. The concept of asymmetrical information, with the seller knowing more about the product than the buyer, is described in detail by Akerlof (1970) as \u2018Akerlof\u2019s lemons\u2019. The published empirical evidence supporting cattle purchase as a route of transmission of infection is summarised below on a disease-by-disease basis (see Table 1\n).",

The stress of transport and mixing may be an additional risk factor in disease recrudescence, e.g. IBR and transmission (Bishop et al., 2010, Holliman, 2003).",

This principle may be applied at a national level, where farmers should avoid importing cattle from exotic disease-affected regions as well as at the farm level. Herds which are likely to have lower likely disease prevalence include: (1) Certified disease-free herds; the risk of introducing specific diseases can be greatly reduced by purchasing stock from certified disease-free source herds, (Wells, 2000, Van Winden et al., 2005, Sibley, 2010) or high health status markets. (2) Closed herds; one key factor associated with increased disease prevalence is having an open rather than a closed herd (Chi et al., 2002b, Weering et al., 2005, Ortiz-Pelaez and Pfeiffer, 2008). (3) Smaller herds; for many diseases seroprevalence in cattle has been found to be proportionate to the size of the source population (Weering et al., 2005, Ortiz-Pelaez and Pfeiffer, 2008). One important example is bovine tuberculosis (bTB). In countries such as Ireland where bTB is endemic, herd risk is significantly associated with herd size (Olea-Popelka et al., 2004, Wolfe et al., 2010).",

Vaccination courses should be completed at least 2 weeks before release from quarantine (Caldow, 2009).

There are no empirical recommendations published on fence height or design. (2) Electric scare wires on each side of the boundary fence or a strip of uninterrupted hedge or trees also ameliorate the risk of transmission of infection (Caldow, 2004); a higher density of hedgerows was found to be negatively correlated with bTB transmission (Mathews et al., 2006). (3) Vaccination against specific pathogens such as BVDv (Scharko et al., 2011).",

Wild deer are a potential source of infection for livestock of a broad range of bacteria, viruses and parasites (B\u00f6hm et al., 2007). Clostridium botulinum intoxication of cattle has been associated with poultry litter contamination of pasture (McLoughlin et al., 1998).",

Semen and embryos can transmit various infectious agents including BVDv and BHV-1, and cases of vaccine contamination with BVDv have been reported (Lindberg and Alenius, 1999, Barkema et al., 2001). Slurry and dirty water can be a biohazard with E. coli O157, Salmonella and Campylobacter surviving for up to 3 months (Nicholson et al., 2005).
