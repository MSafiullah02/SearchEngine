Stakeholders express their local transboundary issues are often inadequately communicated or considered at national level (Booth et al., 2017 [18]. There are gaps at local transboundary level in terms of scientific investment, and in overcoming bureaucratic hurdles in order to share data and expertise. Yet these are the front lines most vulnerable in times of crisis, often requiring rapid access to state-controlled or even cross-border resources. Lack of scientifically relevant (or useable) data at these levels exacerbates their vulnerability, when compared to national level. It is the local level which also contains the flexibility to be proactive in securing themselves, particularly true of transboundary areas, so while there is vulnerability, there is a natural generation of proactive resilience-success stories which should be used as templates for other areas.",

Barriers exist that hinder horizontal integration-particularly across borders-such as language, differing political priorities, divergent funding mechanisms, competition for resources and mismatched timescales for implementation. There is less experience for cooperatively developing lateral multisectoral strategies (Braunschweiger et al., 2018 [19]) amongst administrative members, and traditional conflicts may hinder fruitful cooperation. Coordinating agencies which take on organisational duties for other sectors without challenging their sovereignty are viewed as successful options for increasing horizontal cooperation (Braunschweiger et al., 2018 [19]) along with building on existing networks already in place. Task-oriented project collaboration works best for issue-based cooperation between sectors, which requires to produce visible results. This can lead to longer term partnerships which integrate adaptation measures into ongoing development processes (Braunschweiger et al., 2018 [19]).",

There is a perception that unless directly situated on borders, climatic disasters can be handled by without assistance from neighbouring countries, or from EU support mechanisms. (Germany and the UK for example have aquired rather self-reliant reputations). While most disasters and emergencies within the EU are indeed on a scale manageable to modern industrialized nations, such isolated thinking is potentially problematic in light of a future where climate change may lead to unprecedented hazards and risks both sides of a border (Amaratunga et al., 2017 [20]). There is a need to challenge the perception that emergencies can be adequately dealt with without the need for international assistance, which is currently being starkly illuminated by the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic.",

Transboundary alpine lakes (or watercourses) for example, play host to a variety of competing actors. In parts of South Tyrol (Italy) despite a long history of adaptation, water scarcity issues have risen over the last decade (particularly in early Spring and high Summer) due to a series of dry years combined with increasing demand for water for irrigated agriculture, tourism and households, creating uneven temporal and spatial distribution of demand and supply (EEA, 2009 [21]). In the Ticino region, Italian agricultural extraction requirements placing greater demand in times of summer drought, must be balanced with Swiss flood risk mitigation requirements (Booth et al., 2017 [18]).

This is done proactively at local level and success is reliant on the counterpart authorities matching the initiative. Efforts like this will strengthen cooperation over time and help identify gaps before they emerge in reality.

Such events occur suddenly and whilst they are relatively rare, they tend to be large scale and covered by media. They create new opportunities for forging innovative policies (Kingdon, 1995 [36]) to reflect public problems and seek to best address such issues. These events expose weaknesses of the current system(s) - especially the difficulties linked to coexistence of several (not necessarily coordinated) regulatory frameworks in the transboundary realm. While devastating, these events can often urgently streamline and simplify policy as will be illustrated in Section 2.4 and so they will form a key part in the design process of serious games to virtually test stakeholder interactions.",

When objectivity is upheld towards the other end of the spectrum, policies have the greatest chance to succeed. Similarly, links between central and local governments first need to be robust-their relationship clearly defined, before effective engagement with satellite NGOs and with the European Commission can yield the most reward, creating a strong institutional framework. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) also recognises that intervention of a single agency cannot be evaluated in isolation from what others are doing, particularly as what might seem appropriate from the point of view of a single actor, may not be appropriate from the point of view of the system as a whole (OECD, 1999 [50]). Local government needs to take a shared global view and national governments need to retain an awareness of local issues. Encouraging state-level understanding of the issues faced by local and regional practitioners in transboundary disasters is critical to moving forward, in ensuring they have the flexibility and reliability in seeking resources to deploy in times of crisis. This requires proactive, regular two-way exchange, perhaps via dedicated partnerships or platforms which can balance the interaction neutrally.",

However, even more important than how you say something, is the question of who is going to listen. Institutional channels of communication may not be symmetrical on both (or all) sides of a given border, creating mismatches in scope and response. The scope of the messages in particular was noted as a key aspect: it is very important that the right stakeholders receive the information they need in a way that they can understand and act upon it. Miscommunication problems often arise between two different political cultures. There may be strong public policies on both sides of a border, but the border area itself becomes a transitionary space, in which institutional frameworks might become blurred, or require strengthening in order to fully operate.
