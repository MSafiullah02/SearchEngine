Not surprisingly, synthetic biology means different things to different people, even to leading practitioners in the field.1 To avoid possible confusion for the reader, here we would define it as \u2018deliberate design of improved or novel biological systems that draws on principles elucidated by biologists, chemists, physicists, and engineers\u2019. It is true that scientists have been attempting to design biological systems for decades. However, synthetic biology has become a field of its own only recently, mostly driven by the advances in systems biology and the development of new powerful tools for DNA synthesis and sequencing. Synthetic biology has broad applications in medical, chemical, food, and agricultural industries. In addition to practical applications, synthetic biology also aims to increase our understanding of basic life sciences.",

Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in which the 583 kb Mycoplasma genitalium genome was constructed from 101 pieces of DNA fragments, each 5\u20136 kb in length.14 Initially, synthesis was achieved in two steps: the first step involves multiple in vitro enzymatic recombination to create six large pieces of DNA, while the second step takes advantage of the in vivo yeast recombination mechanism to produce the final synthetic genome (Figure 2). Later, the entire genome assembly process was simplified by directly assembling 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step in yeast.15 A similar method called DNA assembler was developed by Shao and coworkers to assemble a biochemical pathway.16 As proof of concept, a biochemical pathway consisting of eight genes (a total of \u223c19 kb) was assembled in a single step in yeast, resulting in a recombinant strain that could utilize d\u2010xylose to produce a nutraceutical zeaxanthin.

This limit is generally lower than 1010, which is the potential library size that would be generated if a typical protein (300 amino acids) were to be diversified with three randomly introduced point mutations.
