For these reasons, the peripheral airways of infants are more susceptible to inflammatory narrowing than adult airways. In older children and adults, respiratory infections most commonly involve the interstitium and alveoli. Lower respiratory infections in infants, on the other hand, manifest their primary effects in the smaller airways, producing peripheral mucous obstruction and disproportionately severe respiratory distress. This is revealed on the chest films by generalized hyperaeration (air trapping) with focal irregularities of aeration that reflects atelectasis from mucous plugging. True consolidative (alveolar) pneumonia is a much less frequent occurrence (Wesenberg et al. 2006).",
