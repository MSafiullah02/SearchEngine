Intentions to Prescribe Preexposure Prophylaxis Are Associated With Self-efficacy and Normative Beliefs TO THE EDITOR-We read with interest the article by Karris et al [1] , which describes that although a majority of North American infectious disease physicians (74%) support the provision of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to atrisk individuals, strikingly few (9%) had prescribed PrEP. However, there remains a paucity of data regarding the views of primary care providers, who are best poised to prescribe PrEP to at-risk, HIV-negative patients. We conducted an online survey in December 2012 to understand factors associated with intentions to prescribe PrEP among physicians in the United States. Using a model based on the theory of planned behavior, we hypothesized that physicians' intentions to prescribe PrEP are driven by attitudes, self-efficacy, and normative beliefs [2] [3] [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 119, "end": 123, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 571, "end": 574, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1323, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1327, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1331, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment of Persistent Rhinovirus Infection With Pegylated Interferon \u03b12a and Ribavirin in Patients With Hypogammaglobulinemia"}, {"text": "Attitudinal questions assessed beliefs regarding PrEP-related safety, efficacy, adherence, antiretroviral resistance, risk compensation, and malpractice and insurance coverage.
