Academic partners in developed countries could have an important role in the mutual learning process between the two regions by providing support in evidence generation and translation into policy.",

In April, 2016, under the leadership of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, ten Chinese universities joined leading African universities from the Africa Research Implementation Science and Education (ARISE) Network, and HSPH, to establish the China Harvard Africa Network (CHAN). This tripartite network examines the current knowledge on health-care systems for information that could be used to strengthen the health-care systems in Africa and China; CHAN also seeks to build capacity and produce pragmatic solutions for the advancement of health in both regions and beyond.",

Innovations coming out of African health-system reforms also provide answers to some of China's health-care problems; for example, the establishment of public\u2013private partnerships and effective insurance schemes. Current challenges of communicable and non-communicable diseases can be surmounted through collective learning and action. The value of global partnership has been shown in situations of infectious disease prevention and management. The Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa in 2014 highlights the importance of strong health systems capable of timely and integrated responses. China faced similar challenges in 2003, with the outbreak of the SARS coronavirus. Researchers at HSPH and other US institutions have shown that pandemic control, in the context of the SARS and Ebola virus outbreaks, requires comprehensive and coordinated actions\u2014eg, reduction of transmission through public health measures to increase public awareness and identification of vaccines. The continued engagement of academia will bolster the newly established Africa Centers for Disease Control\u2014an initiative also supported by the China Centers for Disease Control and US Centers for Disease Control.5\n",
