This has led to recent progress in their clinical use against various forms of human cancers (briefly reviewed among others by Kelly et al., 2009, Black and Morris, 2012). In contrast to most other \u201concolytic\u201d viruses presently under consideration for clinical use, reoviruses are naturally oncolytic and have not been submitted to genetic manipulation for their clinical use. In fact, it was not possible until recently (Kobayashi et al., 2007) to easily manipulate the reovirus genome using a plasmid-based reverse genetics system.",

Despite the fact that multiple steps of the reovirus replicative cycle are likely involved in preferential replication and virus-induced cancer cell death (Lemay et al., 2007, Marcato et al., 2007), further work has supported the idea that a lower induction of interferon in Ras-transformed cells favors viral propagation and could be of major importance to the virus\u05f3 oncolytic activity (Shmulevitz et al., 2010).",

The \u03c33 protein could rather affect interferon sensitivity due to its ability to sequester the dsRNA activator of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR; however, this property of \u03c33 could be modulated by \u03bc1 since the \u03c33-\u03bc1 heterohexamer does not appear to bind dsRNA (Schiff, 2008). Finally, at least in some cell types, the \u03c32 and \u03bb2 protein were previously suspected to play a role in the control of either induction of interferon signaling or virus\u05f3 sensitivity to interferon (Sherry et al., 1998).",

Both viruses were then reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis and reverse genetics, since a number of differences were observed between the isolate used to construct the reverse genetics plasmids and the parental laboratory stock initially used to isolate the mutant virus. Each four genes exhibiting differences between the parental and mutant viruses were then individually substituted either to replace the mutant gene by its parental counterpart or replacing the parental gene by its mutant counterpart in the parental background. This clearly demonstrated that the single amino acid substitution in one of the two methyltransferase domains of \u03bb2 is the major determinant of the difference in interferon sensitivity between these two viruses.",

Production of infectious virus was next examined by infecting cells and measuring the fold-increase of infectious virus (Fig. 1B). In either the T3DS or P4L-12 background, all viruses harboring substitution of single genes from the other virus did not appear to be significantly different from their background virus. In the T3DS background a small increase (up to approximately sixfold for the S4 substitution) was observed while in the P4L-12 background a twofold increase was observed for M2 and twofold decrease for S4. Overall, there was thus no apparent significant defects when single genes were substituted in either background.",

As previously mentioned, the \u03bb2 protein was previously identified by classical reassortment studies as a possible molecular determinant of the control of interferon response in reovirus-infected cells; however, this is the first time that this has been firmly established using a completely defined genetic system. Interestingly, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that could affect interferon signaling pathways in some cell types, is observed in \u03bb2, although there is currently no evidence that it is actually functional (Stebbing et al., 2014). The amino acid substitution in P4L-12 is not part of this ITAM motif.",

It is still not firmly established if this first methyltransferase domain is responsible for N-7 or the subsequent 2\u2032-O methylation of the cap structure. However, sequence comparisons suggest the latter possibility (Bujnicki and Rychlewski, 2001) and is also consistent with the relative order of the two methyltransferase domains in Cypovirus (Zhu et al., 2014), another double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family. Methylation of the RNA cap structure, especially at the 2\u2032-O position could be of importance to avoid recognition of viral RNA as nonself. It could thus affect either induction of interferon signaling or sensitivity to interferon-induced antiviral proteins, such as IFIT1 (recently reviewed by: Hyde and Diamond, 2015). This aspect has been especially well studied in members of the Flaviviridae family but has also been noticed in such different viruses as coronaviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus and metapneumovirus (Daffis et al., 2011, Zust et al., 2011, Habjan et al., 2013, Kimura et al., 2013, Dong et al., 2014, Kindler and Thiel, 2014, Ma et al., 2014, Menachery et al., 2014). An altered 2\u2032-O methyltransferase activity of \u03bb2 could thus potentially explain the altered interferon resistance of P4L-12 compared to the parental virus. Interestingly, in rotavirus, another member of the Reoviridae family, the capping enzyme VP3 was shown to act as an antagonist of innate immunity (Zhang et al., 2013) and it was proposed that variations in the efficiency of the capping reaction, more specifically that of methyltransferase activity, should be examined to determine if it could affect the ability of the virus to control the innate immune reaction (Arnold et al., 2013, Ogden et al., 2014). It will be of interest to perform similar studies with the \u03bb2 protein of reovirus.",

When interferon induction by T3DS and P4L-12 was compared by recovering supernatant from L929-infected cells (data not shown), both of these supernatants were able to similarly protect cells against the unrelated murine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), as used in previous studies (Sandekian et al., 2013). This is well in accordance with the fact that there is no difference in the \u03bc2 protein of the two viruses and thus probably no significant differences in induction of either interferon or interferon-induced genes. Furthermore, it should be stressed that the presence of a proline at position 208 indicates that these viruses are relatively, although not completely, efficient at repressing interferon signaling (Irvin et al., 2012, Stebbing et al., 2014) suggesting that their difference could rather resides in differences of sensitivity to interferon-induced antiviral mechanisms although this remains to be firmly established.",

The possibility of modulating both the level of interferon signaling and sensitivity of reovirus strains to antiviral interferon-induced genes, by a combination of various mutations in either \u03c33, \u03bc2 and \u03bb2, could certainly contribute to further optimization of viral strains for infection and killing of different cancer cell types.",
