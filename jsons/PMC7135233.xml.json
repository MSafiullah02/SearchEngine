Globalisation and rapidly expanding and increasingly concentrated populations of humans and livestock are driving the emergence of virulent zoonotic pathogens that may be responsible for fatal disease in humans and animals. Because there is no way to predict when or where the next important zoonotic pathogen will emerge, or what its ultimate importance might be, investigation at the first sign of emergence of a new zoonotic disease is particularly important [1]. Such investigation may be described in terms of a discovery-to-control continuum: from recognition of a new disease in a new setting to the various efforts to controlling it, one of these being communication with the public via the media [2].",

Likewise, veterinary public health messages must be customised in such a way that they are interesting, relevant and captivating to their audience. Messages should be clear, easy to understand and easy to act on. Unless it is easy for people to remember how, when and what to do it is unlikely that a veterinary public health communication campaign will be successful.

Audience-centred health communication efforts with a consumer perspective are much more effective in motivating target audiences to change their behaviour. This requires designing and delivering messages that are adapted to the needs, perceptions, preferences and situations of the intended audiences rather than the needs and goals of the message designers or institutions.

Accurate predictions are difficult or impossible to make and rely on historical events that parallel the disease as closely as possible [11].
