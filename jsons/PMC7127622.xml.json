Human coronavirus (HCV) 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine coronavirus and feline infectious peritonitis virus are members of group I, HCV OC43, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) are members of group II, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to group III.

Infectious bronchitis virus is the cause of an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens with potential involvement of kidney and reproductive tract (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997). TCV is the cause of an acute, highly contagious enteric disease of turkeys referred to as bluecomb disease (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1997). Early studies indicated that IBV and TCV were antigenically unrelated based on immune electron microscopy, hemagglutination inhibition and virus-neutralization studies (Ritchie et al., 1973, Dea et al., 1986); however, these findings are inconsistent with recent antigenic and nucleotide sequence analyses (Guy et al., 1997, Breslin et al., 1999, Stephensen et al., 1999). Antigenic analyses by Guy et al. (1997) indicated that IBV and TCV were closely related based on cross-immunofluorescent studies using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Subsequent studies indicated that IBV and TCV were closely related based on the nucleotide sequence of a 1.1-kb segment of the TCV genome spanning portions of both the M and N genes (Breslin et al., 1999). Additionally, Stephensen et al. (1999) demonstrated a close genetic relationship between TCV and IBV based on sequence analysis of a highly conserved region of the polymerase gene. In the present study, the complete nucleocapsid gene and the 3\u2032 UTR of three epidemiologically distinct TCV strains were sequenced and compared with those of previously published IBV strains and representative members of groups I and II coronaviruses, TGEV and BCV, respectively.",

These viruses were isolated from turkeys in Minnesota in 1974, Indiana in 1994 and North Carolina in 1995, respectively. TCV strains were propagated by amniotic inoculation of embryonated turkey eggs (Guy et al., 1997). Viral RNA was extracted from sucrose gradient-purified virus, and cDNA synthesis was accomplished by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as described (Breslin et al., 1999). The RT reaction was primed with an oligo (dT) primer 15 bases in length; this primer along with a specific oligonucleotide primer designed from the 5\u2032 end of the N gene (TGAATTCTAAATTCACCTCAACCTAAGT) (Breslin et al., 1999) was used in the PCR procedure. Primers possessed EcoRI restriction sites that facilitated cloning of cDNA into pUC19; clones were used to transform competent Escherichia coli strain DH5\u03b1 (Gibco BRL) as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). DNA was sequenced at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a Model 373A DNA Sequencer using the Taq Dye Deoxy\u2122 Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing of both strands. Preliminary nucleotide sequence data allowed the design of primers to amplify internal N gene and 3\u2032 UTR regions to confirm the nucleotide sequence. Primers again were designed with EcoRI restriction sites, used in a RT-PCR procedure and cDNA fragments were cloned and sequenced as described above. The complete nucleotide sequence of the N gene and the 3\u2019UTR of each TCV have been deposited in GenBank; accession numbers are TCV (Indiana) AF111995, TCV (Minnesota) AF111996, TCV (NC95) AF111997.",

The size and sequence characteristics of the TCV N protein and 3\u2032 UTR closely resembled those of IBV strains, thus supporting previous antigenic analyses and nucleotide sequence studies that indicated a close relationship between TCV and IBV (Breslin et al., 1999; Guy et al., 1997; Stephensen et al., 1999). Together, these findings refute previous studies that indicated a close relationship between TCV and group II coronaviruses (Dea et al., 1990, Verbeek and Tijssen, 1991). These findings instead indicate that the avian coronaviruses, IBV and TCV, share a close phylogenetic relationship and together comprise group III of the coronavirus major antigenic groups.",
