This is supported by government studies, and well described in a recent report from the Trust for America's Health (TFAH) [58], a nonpartisan, nonprofit research enterprise. They recently published a study designed to assess the performance of 50 states and Washington, DC based upon 10 indicators that relate to the treatment/prevention of infectious diseases (including HIV, influenza, and pertusis). TFAH relied upon publicly available and government data to examine the emergence and reemergence of specific infectious diseases. The results are not inspiring. Based on a scale of 1 to 10 -- with 10 being the highest positive ranking -- the majority of states earned a score of 5 or lower. New Hampshire earned the highest score - 8. Georgia, Nebraska and New Jersey were ranked at the bottom with a score of 3. Of additional concern, more than 2 million American children under 3 years of age do not receive all of the vaccinations recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services, and at risk for whooping cough and measles. Not surprisingly both illnesses have reemerged in the last few years. Not to put too fine a point on this, but according to the TFAH study, only two states - Connecticut and Delaware - met the recommended requirement of fully vaccinating 90 percent of children ages 19 months to 35 months.",
