Therefore, fast and efficient ways to provide accurate information of drug metabolism on the target compounds and their major metabolites are required [1], [2], [3]. In the past, GC with electron capture detection or nitrogen phosphorus detection and HPLC with ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometric detection, fluorescence detection or electrochemical detection (ECD) were the main methods to detect drugs and their major metabolites in vivo. But these technologies cannot provide high enough sensitivity, specificity and molecular structural information for the qualitative assay of drugs and their metabolites. The coupled GC\u2013MS technology can overcome these insufficiencies, but it often requires time consuming derivatization of the target compound [4], [5]. So, this method is not suitable for the detection of drug metabolites, too.",

LC\u2013MS system allows for the analyses of thermolabile, highly polar and non-volatile metabolites owing to its soft-ionization technique and high sensitivity, and the target compounds can be directly determined in mixtures without complicated sample preparation or derivatization. Compared with LC\u2013MS, LC\u2013MS/MS can give us the maximum amount of structural information and high specificity for qualitative analysis at trace levels. It has been proved to be a powerful approach for the metabolic identification of drugs [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. So, LC\u2013MS/MS technique is frequently the initial choice for metabolite detection and identification. Structural elucidation of drug metabolites using LC\u2013MS/MS is based on the premise that metabolites retain the substructures of the parent drug molecule. MS/MS product ion spectrum of each metabolite provides detailed substructural information of its structure. So, using the product ion spectrum of parent drug as a substructural template, metabolites presented in crude mixtures may be rapidly identified and detected based on their changes in molecular masses (\u0394M) and spectral patterns of product ions even without standards for each metabolite [14], [15], [16].",

It has widespread activities such as spasmolytic, anaesthetic, acesodyne and ophthalmic effects, and it is often used to treat transmissible shock, hepatitis, nephritis, sugar diabetes and so on [17], [18], [19]. In China, anisodamine was tentatively used to treat patients for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Despite its important therapeutical values, its metabolism in vivo is not clear yet. Up till now, the works only focused on the quantitative determination of anisodamine in rabbit and human serum by means of thin layer chromatography [20], micellar liquid chromatography [21] and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography [22], [23].",

The MS/MS product ion spectrum of the protonated molecular ion (m/z 306) and the predominant fragmentation patterns are shown in Fig. 1\n. Fragmentation of protonated molecular ion of anisodamine in the ion trap leads to five main product ions at m/z: 288, 276, 140, 122 and 91. The product ions at m/z 288 and 276 were formed by the loss of H2O and HCHO from the parent ion at m/z 306, respectively. The most abundant product ion at m/z 140 was formed by the loss of tropic acid (C9H10O3, 166 Da). The m/z 122 ion was inferred to be produced by the loss of 184 Da (C9H10O3\n + H2O). The product ion at m/z 91 was formed by the loss of NH2CH3 (31 Da) from the m/z 122 ion. It could be concluded that the ions at m/z 140, 122 and 91 were the characteristic product ions of anisodamine, and C9H10O3 (166 Da) and C9H12O4 (184 Da) were the characteristic neutral losses. These characteristic product ions and neutral losses were the key features that allowed identification of metabolites.",
