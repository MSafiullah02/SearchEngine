Similarly, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) had become a worldwide health concern. MERS-CoV originally reported in 2012 (De Wit et al., 2016) . It affected more than 2000 people in 27 countries and 4 sub-continents in the Middle East. While the epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases in 2003 (De Wit et al., 2016) . Since then, a small number of cases have occurred as a result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human transmission (Guangdong, China) (De Wit et al., 2016) .",

This virus is transmitted from person to person via droplet transmission Ozaslan et al., 2020) . Therefore, the virus is spreading easily in overcrowded areas. Most patients experience only mild to moderate symptoms, such as high body temperature in conjunction with some respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and headache. Some people may have severe symptoms like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Chen et al., 2020) . Also, individuals with underlying complications such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, or diabetes potentially display more severe symptoms (Adhikari et al., 2020) . Preventive measures such as masks, frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, avoid public contact, and quarantines are being recommended for reducing the transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment is proven effective, hence, infected people initially rely on symptomatic treatments that showed encouraging profile for blocking the new coronavirus in early clinical trials.",

Analyses of the genome sequence data combined with large-scale antigenic typing have given insights into the pattern of global spread, the genetic diversity during seasonal epidemics, and the dynamics of subtype evolution. SARS-CoV-2 such as the NCBI Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 database (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s7915/202001/ e4e2d5e6f01147e0a8df3f6701d49f33.shtml) and NGDC Genome Warehouse (bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/) make the genomic information publicly available, together with epidemiological data for the sequenced isolates. The data sharing requires users to agree to collaborate with, and appropriately credit, all data contributors. A notable success of this initiative has been the contribution of countries, such as China, Philippines, and Japan, etc. which have previously been reticent about placing data in the public domain. The WHO also supports the endeavor of rapid publication of all available sequences for coronaviruses and there is hope that comprehensive submission to public databases will soon become a reality.",

Therefore, genomic coordinates must be adjusted to compare with previous studies (Koyama et al., 2020) Each genome was first aligned to NC_045512 using the EMBOSS needle with a default gap penalty of 10 and an extension penalty of 0.5. Then, differences in comparison with NC_045512 were extracted to create variants (Tables 1 & 2) (Rice et al., 2000) .

The length of the SARS-CoV genome is over 30 Kb, while just a few coding genes appear not to accord with the general properties for the viral genome and the minimum grouping of hereditary data. In addition to these, it may have some non-structural proteins but lacking data at one place is needed. The absence probably results from their short existing-time before decomposition. In this study, we worked to find the extent of molecular variation between the recently sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2. Numerous investigations have depicted that ORFs and ACE2 genes play a key role during novel coronavirus disease (Koyama et al., 2020; Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019; Van der Meer et al., 1998; Wan et al., 2020) .

NSP6 is the main contrast and it is considered as a putative protein (Koyama et al., 2020) . So, they held the NSP annotations. They further referenced that 12 remarkable variations in NSP3 protein in ORF1ab. Thus concluded that there was a basic connection between the nsp3 association and the inception of coronavirus infection (Hurst et al., 2013a) . Besides, they investigated that NSP3 contains the papain-like protease and is regarded as significant for SARS infection (Niemeyer et al., 2018) . Variations found in subjects began from Wuhan are situated in either TM1 or Y space which is profoundly saved (Hurst et al., 2013a (Hurst et al., , 2013b . Sawicki et al. performed sequencing of ORF1 from a huge available data that was established in labs (Sawicki et al., 2005) . The report distinguished single point transformations coming from nonsynonymous substitutions in nsps 4, 5, 10, 12, 14 and 16. The collective outcomes recommend that the ORF1b nsp 12, 14 and 16 proteins characterize particular cistrons, while the distorted ORF1a proteins nsps 4, 5, and 10 form a compartment together at the location of the coding sequence of ORF1ab (Graham et al., 2008) . Notably, of the eight announced mutations in MHV, seven of the influenced amino acid deposits are correlated with SARS-CoV (Graham et al., 2008) . This methodology may permit the determination of phenotypic travelers that will distinguish by protein interactions. Also, it will permit the progressions to be acquainted in SARS-CoV with deciding whether the ts phenotype can be reproduced in that foundation, with the chance of quickly building up a board of SARS-CoV. Curiously, not only is the slow-growth branch dominated by travelers, but the COVID-19 lineages appear to be phylogenetically related to each other, suggesting an exposure point for these individuals that are distinct from the rest of the population.",
