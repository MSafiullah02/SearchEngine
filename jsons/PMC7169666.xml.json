One of the major impediments to this work has been the limited capacity for the collection, handling and transport of respiratory specimens. There is a critical need for studies to both better understand respiratory disease epidemiology and to evaluate the efficacy of interventions such as vaccines. Given the uncertainty about the interplay between viruses and bacteria in the disease process, viral studies should be a mandatory component of this research.",

The efficiency of this system for detection of influenza virus has been compared favourably to nasopharyngeal nylon\u2010flocked swabs in combination with a universal transport medium (Esposito et al. 2010). Swabs taken from the left nostril were placed in the clinic refrigerator and transported by normal post (air transport) in standard padded postbags from the community once a week as exempt human specimens in accordance with Australia Post\u2019s Dangerous and Prohibited Goods and Packaging requirements (Australia Post, 2009). Posted specimens were transported at ambient temperature for the entire journey to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases (Qpid) Laboratory, Royal Children\u2019s Hospital, Brisbane. Specimens left the clinic on Thursday morning and arrived at Qpid by midday the following Monday where they were immediately frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C. Swabs taken from the right nostril were placed in a portable freezer with a minimum temperature capacity of within \u221250 \u00b0C of the current ambient temperature (Engel\u2010MT60F\u2010G4\u2010S). At the end of 3 weeks, the freezer was transported by car to Darwin using a portable battery power supply (Calibre\u2010PLU127904). Specimens were not thawed in Darwin. They were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until transported to Qpid on dry ice by overnight air transport (total transport time = 16 h) where specimens were frozen on arrival in a \u221270 \u00b0C freezer and stored until they were batch tested for viruses at the end of the study. The fridge and freezer were temperature monitored throughout the study using Escort Junior loggers (Escort Data Logging Systems, Auckland) with twice daily visual inspections of temperature, and 5\u2010minutely electronic logging of temperature. A logger was sent with the final post of specimens to monitor the temperature range experienced by specimens in transit.",

Samples (200 \u03bcl) were extracted using the Qiagen X\u2010tractor Gene (Qiagen, Australia) and the Qiagen DX Xtraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Sample extracts were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C prior to testing. Extraction efficiency was assessed by spiking specimens with a known concentration of Equine Herpes virus (EHV) before extraction (Bialasiewicz et al. 2009). Specimens were tested using previously validated and reported real\u2010time PCR assays with reverse transcription for RNA viruses. We tested for 16 viruses: human rhinoviruses (Lu et al. 2008; Arden & Mackay 2010) influenza A, influenza B, RSV, adenoviruses, HMPV, parainfluenza viruses I, II, and III (Lambert et al. 2008b), bocavirus (Tozer et al. 2009), hPyV\u2010WU, hPyV\u2010KI (Bialasiewicz et al. 2007), and human coronaviruses: OC43, 229E, NL63 (Gunson et al. 2005) and HKU1 (Dare et al. 2007). Appropriate positive and negative controls were included on each PCR run. For hPyV\u2010WU, specimens were initially tested using a duplex assay with two targets (WU\u2010B, WU\u2010C) (Bialasiewicz et al. 2007). If either of these provided a positive signal, a third assay targeting a different region was used (WU\u2010E). WU\u2010E assay details are: TTTCTCCAGGAGATTTAGGCATTTC (forward primer), ATACCCACATATGGTACCCCAGACT (reverse primer), and TCTTCCCAGTAGGAATTAAACTGAGACCACCAGT (probe labelled with FAM fluorophore). The reaction mix consisted of 12.5 \u03bcl Quantitect Probe PCR Mix (Qiagen), 10 pmol of each primer, 4 pmol of probe and 5 \u03bcl of template in a 25\u2010\u03bcl final reaction was performed in a Rotorgene 3000 or 6000 (Qiagen) under the following conditions: 15 min incubation at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. Specimens needed to be positive in either WU\u2010B or WU\u2010C, and then WU\u2010E to be considered positive for hPyV\u2010WU.",

Given the sensitivity and specificity of real\u2010time PCR diagnosis, we considered a specimen from either nostril positive for any virus to represent a true\u2010positive, similar to previous studies (Lambert et al. 2008b; Meerhoff et al. 2010). This approach means that the specificity of either specimen type for any virus will be, by definition, 100%. Using this standard, we calculated sensitivity overall and by specific viruses with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Binomial probability was used to test our primary hypothesis of no difference in the likelihood of virus detection in either the mailed or frozen sample for discordant specimens, with \u03b1 = 0.05 (two\u2010sided test). Cycle threshold (Ct) values (cycle number at the threshold level of log\u2010based fluorescence) are a semi\u2010quantitative marker of, and are indirectly proportional to, nucleic acid load. A 3.3 cycle difference represents approximately a one log difference in nucleic acid load (Whiley et al. 2010). We used t\u2010tests to compare differences in: the mean ERV3 and detected virus Ct values between paired specimens and the mean ERV3 Ct value between discordant specimens. Specimens where ERV3 was not detected were arbitrarily assigned a Ct value of 50 for the purpose of mean Ct value calculation. All data were analysed using Stata 10 for Windows (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).",

So difficult is the task of collecting specimens for viral identification in remote locations, that a paper from Guinea\u2010Bissau suggested a one\u2010third reduction in sensitivity for RSV identification might be reasonable in epidemiological and vaccine studies if the method was acceptable to parents, easy to implement and had affordable costs (Stensballe et al. 2002). Our study, using sensitive real\u2010time PCR assays, has shown that diagnostic studies in remote settings can be conducted by simply mailing specimens through routine postal systems.",

While the mean ERV3 Ct value was significantly lower (higher nucleic acid load) in frozen than in mailed specimens, the difference was not clinically meaningful representing a less than one log reduction in load. ERV3 Ct values also demonstrated that the quality of specimen collection appeared to play a limited role in failure to identify a virus. For discordant paired specimens with one specimen negative for any virus, the mean ERV3 Ct value was no lower in positive samples than in the negative samples. The mean Ct value for RNA viruses, typically thought to be less robust than DNA viruses, (Jerome et al. 2002) in concordant pairs was lower (higher load) in the mailed than in the frozen specimens. Further, the difference in the mean Ct values for mailed and frozen specimens in concordant pairs for RNA viruses was less than the same difference in DNA viruses, although the number of DNA viruses available for this calculation was small (n = 5).",

Twenty\u2010eight per cent of well controls were positive for any virus. The method of storage and transport to the laboratory in South Africa was not described.

It is not uncommon for daytime temperatures to exceed 40 \u00b0C for extended periods. Mail bags may sit on airstrip tarmacs for extended periods. The effect of these temperatures on the viability and sensitivity of viral specimens needs further investigation. A further limitation is the convenience sampling strategy which may result in an inaccurate representation of the prevalence of viruses in the community. Similarly, the lack of adolescents (aged 5\u201317) means that an important section of the population was not adequately represented in our study population.",

In the absence of any other diagnostic service during a community\u2010wide respiratory outbreak, this may also be appropriate as a diagnostic tool in some settings, particularly to guide public health responses to outbreaks of respiratory illness. In a Melbourne cohort study of pre\u2010school\u2010aged children, a nasal swab from both nares appeared just as likely to identify any virus as a swab from both nares combined with an oropharyngeal swab (Lambert et al. 2008a). In future studies, to maximize virus detection, we recommend sampling from each nare with the one swab. Combined with sensitive molecular techniques, this approach will help us understand the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and bacteria in remote locations, where recurrent infections and persistent carriage may result in chronic lung disease.",
