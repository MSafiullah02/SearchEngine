In a recent study [4] , five patients in a family cluster who presented with unknown-cause pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China, from Wuhan and members of another family who did not have any travel or residence history were finally diagnosed with COVID-19, indicating person-to-person transmission of novel coronavirus pneumonia. Another study based on the reproductive number (R0) also suggested rapid person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 [2] . In their study, R0 of COVID-19 was 2.2, indicating disease transmission from each patient to 2.2 other individuals. As of January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the outbreak as a global health emergency. By February 25, 2019, 77,779 confirmed cases and 2666 deaths were reported in China, while 2459 confirmed cases and 34 deaths were reported in 33 different countries outside of China.",

            "text": "Viruses are the most common cause of respiratory infection [5] . Influenza viruses are important human respiratory pathogens that cause seasonal upper respiratory tract infections in the community, endemic infections, and periodic, unpredictable pandemics [5, 6] . Influenza viruses are single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza type A is the most important of all respiratory viruses in terms of morbidity and mortality in the general population. Influenza A virus is transmitted from person to person through aerosolized or respiratory droplets. In the USA, more than 35,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations due to influenza occur annually, and the number continues to increase [6] . Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The 2002-2003 pandemic of SARS and the ongoing emergence of MERS have demonstrated that CoVs posed significant threats to public health [7, 8] . A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans [2, 9, 10] . The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a wide concern worldwide. The clinical manifestations of viral pneumonia are diverse and overlap [6] . The clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue are found in both influenza pneumonia and COVID-19. It is difficult to predict etiology based on clinical manifestations. Patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed positive detection of COVID-19 in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract of patients were admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center for further treatment [7, 11] . False-negative COVID-19 cases were reported in recent investigations [12, 13] . In our center, RT-PCR was performed the first three times in one case of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19, revealing a negative detection of COVID-19. Another case who did not have epidemic exposure accompanied by dry cough was finally confirmed as COVID-19. However, CT images of the two cases showed lung lesions. Additionally, the chest CT findings of viral pneumonia were non-specific and difficult to differentiate from those of other infections [6] . However, a similar pathogenesis of pneumonia caused by the same viral family often shows similar imaging characteristics. Although not all cases manifest with typical patterns, most typical imaging patterns of viral pneumonia can be classified according to viral families [5, 6] . Recent studies have demonstrated that CT can play a critical role in the early identification of pneumonia and help in accurate diagnosis [7, 8, 10, 11, 14] . Some cases with CT characteristics, such as ground-grass opacity (GGO) lesions following peripheral and crazy-paving patterns, combined with the history of epidemic exposure can be highly suspected of having novel coronavirus pneumonia. In this season, influenza is more common than COVID-19. An accurate diagnosis in the case of no epidemic exposure and no fever symptom is worth exploration. Recent studies [15, 16] have shown that the early identification, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19 were very important. However, direct comparisons of the imaging features of the two different forms of viral pneumonia have not been performed. This study aimed to investigate the differential diagnostic CT findings between influenza and COVID-19.",

Early detection, isolation, and effective treatment are critical to block the spread of COVID-19, which has been declared an emergency by the WHO emergency committee [15] . Additionally, influenza has been a very common cause of respiratory tract infection in this period in China. Influenza leads to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide every year [19] . Influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 usually show similar clinical manifestations, such as cough, fever, and myalgia. The two different forms of Fig. 2 GGO lesion involvement pattern. Volume rendering reconstruction was implemented into images a-d. And e-g were the original thin-slice images. a Cluster-like involvement pattern (white arrow). b Patchy involvement pattern (white arrow). c Combination of GGO and consolidation opacities pattern (white arrow). d Whole consolidation pattern (white arrow). e Image e showed cluster-like GGO along the bronchial tree in the right inferior lobe. f Image f showed multifocal patchy GGO located in bilateral lung inferior lobe. g Image g showed combination of GGO and consolidation opacities (arrow). h Image h showed whole consolidation showing combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, shrinking GGO contour (black arrow), and nonspecific distribution viral pneumonia can cause a decrease in white blood cell and lymphocyte counts. These similar clinical characteristics can lead to confusion among physicians in differentiating between the two kinds of disease. It is hard for clinicians to provide an accurate diagnosis in the case of no epidemic exposure. However, treatment and clinical outcomes are completely different. Our study showed shorter time duration from onset of symptoms to the CT examination in COVID-19, because in some sites, CT was used to diagnose COVID-19 before the PCR test, and perhaps this is the reason for the short period when compared with influenza. Recently, some published studies have analyzed CT images of COVID-19 and reported many helpful CT findings. In this study, the CT findings of COVID-19 were analyzed and compared with those of influenza pneumonia. This study showed that CT could supply some positive hints in distinguishing COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia.",

A recent study including 51 confirmed patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that peripheral distribution was a characteristic distribution pattern [7] . Most pulmonary lesions in patients with COVID-19 involved bilateral lungs with multiple lung lobes and a balanced predominant distribution in the peripheral part of the lungs in this study. Previous studies reported that influenza pneumonia had lower lung lobe involvement or normal CT images [5, 20] . Most pulmonary lesions were located in the inferior lobe in influenza pneumonia (57.6%), while COVID-19 showed a balanced lung lobe predomination (53.8%). The lung lobe predomination was found to be significant in the two groups, and the results were consistent with other recent findings [5, 7] . Both COVID-19 and influenza presented GGO or GGO with consolidation in this study, and no significant difference was found in the two groups. GGO and consolidation are nonspecific and common CT findings in viral pneumonia [5, 6, 20, 21] . However, COVID-19 presented a high frequency of clear lesion margin (46.2%) and shrinking contour (69.2%) compared with influenza pneumonia (10.9% and 1.1%, respectively). Additionally, more patients with influenza pneumonia showed a cluster-like pattern along the bronchial tree (77.2%), while patchy (38.5%) and combination of GGO and consolidation opacity pattern (46.2%) were seen in most patients with COVID-19.

Additionally, although interlobular and intralobular septal thickening was a typical characteristic of COVID-19 in recent published studies [7, 8, 11, 24] , it was rarely found in this study. Only 2 of 13 (15.4%) patients with COVID-19 presented intralobular septal thickening, while none showed interlobular septal thickening. Similarly, a few patients with influenza pneumonia showed interlobular (6.5%) and intralobular septal thickening (5.4%) in this study. This was probably because most of the enrolled patients in this study were the early stage of COVID-19 (mean time from onset of symptoms to the CT examination was only 1.5 days). Multifocal lesions, GGO, and consolidation were the common CT findings of viral pneumonia; therefore, the findings including lesion number and attenuation were not significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, and pleura effusion were more found in bacterial pneumonia, which performed not significantly different between the two groups.",

Nevertheless, CT manifestations in COVID-19 in this study were consistent with those in previous studies. Second, this study was retrospective in design, especially for the influenza pneumonia cohort. Most patients did not undergo CT scanning, leading to a selection bias and therefore undermining the validity of the results. Third, influenza A viruses can be classified into subtypes according to a combination of 16 known hemagglutinins (H1-H16) and 9 neuraminidases (N1-N9) [25] . In this study the influenza A viruses were not divided into subgroups according to this standard. Fourth, only 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. They were not divided into different types according to different pathological processes, which usually present diverse CT manifestations. Finally, the findings were not compared between the influenza A and influenza B subgroups because the treatment and clinical outcomes usually were similar. Nevertheless, the results were encouraging and should be used to generate hypotheses for future large-scale multicenter studies using CT to distinguish COVID-19 from other forms of viral pneumonia.",
