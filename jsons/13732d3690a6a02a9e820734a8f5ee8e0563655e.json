Pre-mRNA splicing, furthermore, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium therefore provides useful information on the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights into the interplay of its functional domains. Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between arbitrary nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. A naive implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n 11 ). Although we were able to reduce this to O(n 6 ) for many practical applications a further reduction seems difficult. We conclude, therefore, that sampling approaches, which are much easier to implement, are also theoretically favorable for most real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules.",

Most directly, the question arises whether panhandle-like structures (in which 3' and 5' ends of long RNA molecules are placed in close proximity) are the rule or an exception. Panhandles have been reported in particular for many RNA virus genomes. Several studies [28, 8, 2, 13] agree based on different models that the two ends of single-stranded RNA molecules are typically not far apart. On a more technical level, the problem to compute the partition function over RNA secondary structures with given end-to-end distance d, usually measured as the number of external bases (plus possibly the number of structural domains) arises for instance when predicting nucleic acid secondary structure in the presence of single-stranded binding proteins [9] or in models of RNA subjected to pulling forces (e.g. in atom force microscopy or export through a small pore) [10, 23, 11] . It also plays a role for the effect of loop energy parameters [7] .",

            "text": "In contrast to the end-to-end distance, the graph-distance between two arbitrarily prescribed nucleotides in a larger RNA structure does not seem to have been studied in any detail. However, this is of particular interest in the analysis of singlemolecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments [25] . This technique allows to monitor the distance between two dye-labeled nucleotides and can reveal details of the kinetics of RNA folding in real time. It measures the nonradiative energy transfer between the dye-labeled donor and acceptor positions. The efficiency of this energy transfer, E fret , strongly depends on the spatial distance R according to E fret = (1 + (R/R 0 ) 6 ) \u22121 . The F\u00f6rster radius R 0 sets the length scale, e.g. R 0 \u2248 54\u00c5 for the Cy3-Cy5 dye pair. A major obstacle is that, at present, there is no general and efficient way to link smFRET measurements to interpretations in terms of explicit molecular structures. To solve this problem, a natural first step to compute the distribution of spatial distances for an equilibrium ensemble of 3D structures. Since this is not feasible in practice despite major progress in the field of RNA 3D structure prediction [4] , we can only resort to considering the graph-distances on the ensemble of RNA secondary structures instead. Although a crude approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that the graph distance can be related to the smFRET data such as those reported by [14] . From a computer science point of view, furthermore, we show here that the distance distribution can be computed exactly using a dynamic programming approach.",

The basic idea is to generalize Equation (1) to computing the partition function Z v,w [d] . The main question now becomes how to recurse over decompositions of both the inside and the outside paths. Fig. 1 shows that the outside paths are important for the green region, i.e., the region that is covered by an arc.

The set \u03a9 of all secondary structures on \u03be can be divided into two disjoint subclasses that have to be treated differently: Note that this bipartition explicitly depends on v and w.

As an example, we consider the graph distance distribution of a Diels-Alderase (DAse) ribozyme (Fig. 2 (A) ). Histograms of smFRET efficiency (E fret ) for this 49 nt long catalytic RNA are reported in [14] for a large number of surface-immobilized ribozyme molecules as a function of the Mg 2+ concentration in the buffer solution. A sketch of their histograms is displayed in Fig. 2 (B) . The dyes are attached to sequence positions 6 (Cy3) and 42 (Cy5) and hence do not simply reflect the end-to-end distance, Fig. 2 (A)(c). In this example, we observe the the expected correspondence small graph distances with a strong smFRET signal. This is a particular interesting example, since the minimal free energy (mfe) structure (Fig. 2 (A)(a) ) predicted with RNAfold is not identified with the real secondary structure (Fig. 2 (A)(c) ). In fact, the ground state secondary structure is ranked as the 3rd best sub-optimal structure derived via RNAsubopt -e. The free energy difference between these two structures is only 0.1kcal/mol. However, their graph distances show a relatively larger difference. The 2nd best sub-optimal structure (Fig. 2 (A)(b) ) looks rather similar with the 3rd structure, in particular, they share the same graph distance value.",

In the absence of Mg 2+ , the I state dominates, and only small fractions are found in states U and F. Unfortunately, the salt dependence of RNA folding is complex [15, 19] and currently is not properly modeled in the available folding programs. We can, however, make use of the qualitative correspondence of low salt concentrations with high temperature. In Fig. 2 (C) we therefore re-compute the graph distance distribution in the ensemble at an elevated temperature of 50 \u2022 C. Here, the real structure becomes the second best structure with free energy \u221210.82kcal/mol and we observe a much larger fraction of (nearly) unfolded structures with longer distances between the two beacon positions. Qualitatively, this matches the smFRET data showed in Fig. 2 (B) .",

For the shortest path from v to j, it consists either of a shortest path v p i and the arc {i, j}, or it goes directly to j without using the arc {i, j}. How does this distinction translate to the partition function approach? If we want to calculate the contribution of this case to the partition function Z v,w [d], we have to split both the sequence \u03be[i, w] and distance d as follows ] is the partition function starting and ending with a single-stranded base as defined in Equation (2), and Z B,v i,j [d , d r ] is the partition function consisting of all structures of \u03be[i, j] containing the base pair {i, j} with the property that the shortest path from v to i has length d and the shortest path from v to j has length d r . In addition, d, d r and d 2 must satisfy d = d r + d 2 . The remaining cases for the contribution of the class \u03a9 0 to Z v,w [d] are given by all other possible combinations of v and w being single-stranded or being covered by an arc, i.e., [d , d r ] = 0 for d + d r > 0. This allows us to conveniently model all cases where either v or w are external, i.e., a.), b.), and d.), as special cases of c.).In case c.) we have to split the distance d into four contributions and we require two splitting positions for the sequence for all combinations of i, j, v, w. This would result in an O(n 6 D 5 ) algorithm. A careful inspection shows, however, that the split of the distances for the arcs into d and d r is unnecessary. Since we want to know only distance to the left/right end overall, we can simply introduce two matrices Z B,v,",
