The outbreak of the novel A H1N1 virus (swine flu) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) from 11 June 2009 until 10 August 2010. These pandemics happen when a new influenza virus, to which the population has little or no immunity emerges and starts to spread. Unlike seasonal influenza, high rates of disease due to a pandemic virus may occur throughout the year. Swine flu is a novel strain of the influenza A virus affecting humans and contains segments of genes from pig, bird and human influenza viruses.",

These pandemics were responsible for a large number of fatalities, the Spanish Flu being the most severe and caused severe pneumonias, particularly among pregnant women (Table 1). A recently published epidemiological study about cohorts born in and around the pandemic estimated that the individuals born had a >20% excess cardiovascular disease at 60\u201382 years of age, relative to those born without exposure to the influenza epidemic, thus suggesting that prenatal exposure to even uncomplicated maternal influenza may have lasting consequences later in life [3].",

From October 2010 to early January 2011, 50 deaths were reported by the Health Protection Agency. Forty-five of these people died with the H1N1 (2009) strain and 5 with Influenza B.

It affects around 5\u201315% of the population and most of the complications and deaths tend to affect the elderly population. The swine flu virus, however, typically affects the younger population, i.e. from 5 to 65 years. Most will experience a mild illness and make a full recovery. Children and young adults appear to be most susceptible to clinical infection with the highest incidence in 5\u20139 and 10\u201314 year olds, with a smaller number of cases in adults older than 50 years of age (born before 1957). The low number of cases seen in those aged over 50 is thought to be due to previous exposure in this age group to similar strains of H1N1 that circulated between 1918 and 1957. The median duration of illness is estimated at 7 days. However, people who are in the at risk group such as those with underlying medical conditions e.g. chronic respiratory disease, asthma, diabetes, chronic heart disease, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, morbidly obese, those who are on medication to suppress their immune system and children under the age of 5 years. Pregnant women are all at higher risk of developing complications should they catch the infection. The illness may be complicated by bronchitis, or viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia.",

There appears to be a tendency towards humoral immunity. As the virus replicates intracellularly, the ability to fight off an infection is reduced. It is known that infections such as chicken pox get worse in pregnancy, particularly in the later half of pregnancy, but this is due to the risk of pneumonitis from local spread to the respiratory system of the virus and also the mechanical effects of the enlarged uterus on the diaphragm and the respiratory system. There is no evidence that Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or tuberculosis get worse in pregnancy.

There may be situations where a preterm baby needs to be delivered in order to improve the outcome for ventilation of a very ill mother. The decision is made in conjunction with the obstetric, critical care and neonatal teams. The pregnant woman should be informed but if unable to participate in clinical decision making, the partner or close relatives should usually be involved in discussions. In order to improve the outcome for the premature infant, corticosteroids (in accordance with the guidance above) should ideally be administered at least 24 h prior to delivery. It is unlikely that pregnancies in the 1st or early second trimesters will need to be terminated unless it is felt that continuation of the pregnancy will be detrimental to the woman\u2019s condition. There may be occasions where a woman who is booked for elective caesarean section becomes symptomatic at the time of the planned procedure. If possible, it would be advisable to commence her on antivirals and to delay the procedure by about 5 days, to allow her to recover, in order not to increase her risks of respiratory complications, and also to reduce the risk of spread to other patients and staff. In severe cases of respiratory complications where the woman has developed Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and where she is not responding to mechanical ventilation, she may have to be considered for Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). This is highly specialized treatment and the decision is made by the Intensive Care specialists. As above, it may not always be necessary to terminate a pregnancy in the first or early second trimesters as there is no benefit in doing so for maternal ventilation. It is of vital importance to maintain the maternal physiology in the best possible state in order to allow the satisfactory progress of the pregnancy. There is now more capacity for ECMO treatment in the UK and more pregnant women are being referred to ECMO units for treatment. It is vitally important that the obstetric teams in the ECMO units are jointly involved in the mother\u2019s care and good communication is essential.",

Oseltamivir is given in the form of oral capsules and zanamivir is given as an inhaler (Diskhaler). The safety of these antiviral drugs in pregnancy has been looked at from experience with their usage in seasonal flu in some countries and from recent data from Canada. Although oseltamivir has been shown to cross the placenta and breast milk in small amounts, no adverse effects on the fetus or pregnancy have been recorded. As zanamivir acts in the respiratory tract with no absorption into the blood stream, it is recommended as first line treatment of swine flu in pregnancy in the United Kingdom. However, if the woman is unable to tolerate the inhaler e.g. if she has severe asthma or is admitted to hospital with complications such as pneumonia, oseltamivir is the recommended drug for treatment. The benefits of antiviral treatment are most noticeable if it is commenced within 48 h of symptom onset but recent experience with hospitalised patients reveals that antivirals given more than 48 h after symptom onset also confer benefit.",
