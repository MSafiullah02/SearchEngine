            "text": "The pseudoknot is a simple tertiary structure motif found in a wide range of RNA molecules; because of their structure, pseudoknots can give insight into how tertiary and secondary RNA structures contribute to the stability and kinetics of folding. Among the many different types of pseudoknots classified by their topology, the most common is the H-type pseudoknot.1 The H-type pseudoknot consists of a hairpin stem (stem 1) with a second stem formed by the downstream region that base-pairs with the loop of stem 1. H-type pseudoknots are found in many kinds of RNA molecules including messenger RNA,2 ribosomal RNA,3 transfer-messenger RNA,4 catalytic self-splicing RNA5\n,\n6 and viral genomic RNA.7 While RNA pseudoknots often serve as structural elements helping to stabilize complex three-dimensional structures, they also perform an active role as essential elements in the regulation of several biological processes. Deletion of key pseudoknots can disrupt activity in telomerase8\n,\n9 and catalytic ribozymes.10., 11., 12., 13. Pseudoknots also play a role in initiation of internal ribosome entry translation,14\n,\n15 binding of ribosomal proteins to RNA,16., 17., [18] and controlling the translational frame during protein synthesis.19., 20., [21], 22., 23., [24]\n",

            "text": "Currently, it is possible to predict secondary structure from a nucleic acid sequence based on experimentally derived thermodynamic values.25\n,\n26 However, the goal of predicting tertiary structure from an RNA sequence has yet to be achieved. To meet this goal, a better understanding of the contributions of tertiary interactions to RNA stability and folding kinetics is crucial. Comparison of the folding and unfolding characteristics of an RNA pseudoknot and its corresponding hairpins provides a simple system for quantifying the contributions of tertiary interactions. As many in vivo RNA unfolding events are accomplished by molecular motors that exert force on the RNA,27 the effects of tertiary structure on the mechanical characteristics of RNA unfolding may have a direct relevance to the biological functions of RNA. Extensive studies on the folding characteristics of pseudoknots and other RNA structures using thermal or chemical denaturation methods have provided much useful information.23\n,\n28., 29., 30., 31., 32., 33., 34. However, mechanical unfolding differs significantly from these methods. Thermal and chemical denaturation act upon an RNA globally, thus, unfolding can begin with any of the base-pairs. In contrast, mechanical force acts locally upon the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of an RNA hairpin; the base-pairs of a hairpin unfold sequentially along the stem towards the loop. Furthermore, force applied to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of an RNA will be experienced differently by a secondary structure such as a hairpin, than it will be experienced by a tertiary structure such as a pseudoknot. As illustrated by the arrows indicating direction of force in Figure 1\n, a hairpin will experience a localized tensile force whereas a pseudoknot will experience a shearing force across its structure. Mechanical unfolding of RNA, whether carried out in vivo by molecular machines or carried out in vitro by optical tweezers, is influenced by tertiary interactions in a manner that is not revealed by thermal and chemical unfolding. Thus, mechanical unfolding and refolding of the tertiary conformations of RNA can provide insight relevant to in vivo biological processes.\n",

Previous studies have identified three RNA components that determine the efficiency of \u22121 PRF: a slippery sequence, a linker region and a downstream structural element. The downstream structure is most often a pseudoknot.21 The frameshifting efficiency shows a wide range of variability among pseudoknots; alterations in the structure of the pseudoknot can substantially affect this frameshifting efficiency. Previous studies have established that the thermodynamic stability is not correlated with frameshifting efficiency.37., 38. Though a recent paper reporting on the mechanical unfolding of two mutant pseudoknots presents data that suggest the magnitude of the average unfolding force may be correlated with frameshifting efficiency,39 it is clear that the regulation of ribosomal frameshifting is not simply a matter of thermodynamics. It has been proposed that the kinetics of unfolding may dictate frameshifting efficiency,23 and in particular, the kinetics of unfolding along a mechanical reaction coordinate, but these properties have not been characterized for frameshifting pseudoknots until now.",

Therefore, the structural characteristics of a pseudoknot that determine frameshifting efficiency may be related to its mechanical properties. The possibility that \u22121 PRF is dependent on the mechanical tension induced by a folded pseudoknot was a fundamental component of the torsional restraint model36 and this hypothesis was recently further strengthened by cryo-electron microscopic imaging of eukaryotic ribosomes complexed with mRNA containing a frameshifting pseudoknot.40 Accordingly, using mechanical force to unfold and refold individual pseudoknots can provide useful insight into the role that the mechanical properties of pseudoknots play in the frameshifting process. Of course, we recognize that chemical interactions between the pseudoknot and the translational apparatus will also play a role.",

The differences in mechanical properties of the wild-type and mutant pseudoknots, and between the pseudoknots and hairpins can shed light on the role of these properties in the frameshifting efficiency of pseudoknots.

To characterize the role of Mg2+ in the unfolding and refolding of pIBV, force-ramp experiments were done in the presence and absence of Mg2+. As shown in Figure 3(a), in 5 mM MgCl2, pIBV shows a single unfolding transition with an average length of 16(\u00b11.5) nm (Table 1\n). This indicates that in the presence of Mg2+, pIBV unfolds through rupturing of one compact conformation rather than the sequential unfolding of two constituent stems. The curves are reasonably well aligned with two calculated curves of the WLC model based on the folded and unfolded pseudoknot conformations. The average unfolding force and the distribution of unfolding forces both show a strong dependence on the pulling rate. The molecule unfolds at a high force range at fast pulling rates (around 31 pN at 10 pN s\u22121) with a wide distribution of unfolding forces (SD, 3.8 pN), whereas it unfolds around 26 pN at 3 pN s\u22121 with a narrower distribution (SD, 2.9 pN). As shown in Figure 3(a), the pIBV pulling curves show a large hysteresis between unfolding and refolding transitions even at the slowest pulling rate. This phenomenon indicates that the unfolding and refolding process of this molecule is slow compared with the pulling rates.",

Rates of reactions depend exponentially on force proportional to the distance to the transition state45 as described by equation (1):(1)k=k0eF\u0394X\u2021/kBTwhere k\n0 is the apparent rate constant for unfolding at zero force, F is the force, k\nB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. The value of k\n0 is not the value that would actually be obtained at zero force, because \u0394X\n\u2021 is force dependent and approaches zero at zero force. Kinetic data can be obtained from the distribution of unfolding forces as a function of the rate at which the force is applied, the pulling rate. The relationship allows the force-dependent rate coefficients and distance to transition state values to be extracted from the distribution of unfolding forces using the following equation:41., [43]\n(2)ln[rln(1/P)]=ln[k0/(\u0394X\u2021/kBT)]+(\u0394X\u2021/kBT)Fwhere r is pulling rate, P is the probability that a molecule is folded at force F and pulling rate r, and F is the force for unfolding. Analogous definitions apply when the equation is used to describe refolding. We have applied this method to obtain rate coefficients and distances to the transition state for the unfolding process of pIBV and hpS12 in both Mg2+ and EDTA conditions. The rate coefficients and distance to transition state values are shown in Table 2(A) and details of representative pIBV data are shown as an example in Figure 5\n.",

For the pseudoknot the sum of distances to transition states is less than the size of the transition and for the hairpin the sum is greater than the size of the transition. The hairpin data are consistent with a previous study on the mechanical unfolding of an RNA hairpin where the \u0394X\n\u2021\nunfold and \u0394X\n\u2021\nrefold values were both approximately 12 nm and the total \u0394X was approximately 18 nm.41 The discrepancies between the sums \u0394X\n\u2021\nunfold and \u0394X\n\u2021\nrefold and the total \u0394X indicate that the unfolding processes are not the reverse of the refolding processes. This is understandable when one considers that transition states of the forward and reverse reactions are identical only for two-state reactions. In the case of RNA folding reactions studied here, the reactions are two-state in the scale of seconds. However, many RNA folding reactions have intermediates in the millisecond or microsecond time scale53 and, therefore, the forward and reverse reactions are not necessarily identical.",

We could not directly measure the reversible work for the unfolding and refolding processes of pIBV in both the presence and the absence of Mg2+, since the processes are irreversible even at our slowest pulling rates. However, using the Crook's fluctuation theorem we could estimate the reversible work from many repeated irreversible unfolding and refolding pulling curves54 (Figure 6\n). The reversible work is equal to the Gibbs free energy change of a molecule during the transition between its folded and unfolded state. We pulled RNA molecules many times (\u223c70 pulling curves) using the same experimental setting on the same day to obtain the distributions of their unfolding and refolding work. Though these are irreversible processes, using the Crook's fluctuation theorem,55 we obtained the reversible unfolding/refolding work (\u0394G) from the crossover point of the unfolding and refolding work distributions. Using this method, we found that the estimated reversible unfolding work of pIBV drastically increased in the presence of Mg2+ (63(\u00b11) kcal mol\u22121 at an unfolding force of 29 pN) compared with the value in the absence of Mg2+ (45(\u00b11) kcal mol\u22121 at an unfolding force of 18 pN), which indicates that the presence of Mg2+ significantly stabilizes the pseudoknot (Figure 6 and Table 2(B)).

During hopping experiments, an RNA molecule is held at a constant force at which both unfolding and refolding transitions can be observed in an experimentally accessible time scale.41., 42., 51. However, hopping experiments can only access forces near the equilibrium; for many molecules the range of forces is too narrow for the collection of data across a significant range of forces. To perform constant force experiments across a wider range of forces the force-jump method can be used instead. A diagram of a force-jump experiment is shown in Figure 7\n. The cycle begins at low force with the molecule in its folded conformation. Next, the force is rapidly increased to a value at which the molecule will unfold within an experimentally accessible time scale. Simultaneously, the stretching of the RNA/DNA hybrid handles resulting from the sudden force increase produces an increase in extension (\u0394X) of the molecular tether. The new imposed force is held constant until an increase in extension due to the unfolding of the molecule occurs. Once unfolding has been observed, force is ramped higher to ensure that complete unfolding of the molecule has indeed occurred. After this second force increase, a gradual increase in extension occurs because of further stretching of the handles. Next the force is rapidly decreased to a value at which the molecule will refold on an experimentally accessible time scale and finally ramped to a lower value to ensure complete refolding of the molecule before the cycle is repeated.51\n",

For pIBV, the data from force ramp as well as constant force experiments give no evidence of detectable intermediates, indicating a single-step transition between a folded state and unfolded state. However, as shown in Figure 8, an IBV mutant pseudoknot, pKA13, infrequently (about 10% of the trajectories in the 23 pN\u201325 pN unfolding force and 21 pN\u201323 pN refolding force range) shows two-step unfolding/refolding processes revealing the presence of a distinct intermediate in the constant-force experiments. This observation is consistent with the observation of two-step transitions in the force-extension curves of pKA13 at slow pulling rates (data not shown). These results indicate that pKA13 goes through a detectable, partially folded intermediate state during its unfolding and refolding. Evidence of intermediate states was present, but less frequent in pKA18 data and rare in pKA9 data. The molecular explanation for this difference in the folding pathways of the four pseudoknots is unclear. We report the observation of these intermediates without speculation on their significance, and with hopes that it may prove useful to future work on RNA folding. Though the presence of intermediates was observed, to a varying degree, in the three mutant pseudoknots, overall a one-step transition without intermediate states is the most dominant transition pattern for all three IBV mutant pseudoknots.",

As pIBV and hpS12 have the same base-pairs (Figure 1), we expect them to have similar calculated thermal stabilities. Our force-ramp data (in 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) give the free energy change at zero force, \u0394G\n0, of 37(\u00b13) kcal mol\u22121 for the unfolding of pIBV and 34(\u00b13) kcal mol\u22121 for the unfolding of hpS12. These results are consistent with our expectations. However, in the presence of Mg2+, the average unfolding force of pIBV is significantly higher than that of hpS12 at all pulling rates (Table 1). The mechanical unfolding of pIBV is a kinetically controlled process, except at extremely slow pulling rates where the process is reversible. Thus, although the thermodynamic stability of a the tertiary structure-forming pIBV can be similar to its secondary structure counterpart (hpS12), its response to mechanical force, and in particular the kinetics of this response is very different to the corresponding hairpin.",

The pseudoknot is brittle (short distance from its folded state to its transition state), whereas the secondary structure is compliant (larger distance from its folded state to its transition state). The short distance to the transition state characterizes the fact that the pseudoknot unfolds over a wide range of forces. The standard deviation of the average unfolding force distribution is noticeably larger for pIBV than it is for the corresponding hairpin; the unfolding rate coefficient of pIBV also changes much more slowly with a change in the unfolding force compared with hpS12. The distance to the transition state of hpS12 for both unfolding and refolding is large (\u223c12 nm), which is consistent with earlier studies of RNA hairpins.41\n",

Pseudoknots unfold at higher forces than hairpins, and their rates of unfolding increase much less with increasing force. Do these characteristics provide insight into the role of pseudoknots in \u20131 programmed ribosomal frameshifting? Yes. We propose that the slow unfolding of a pseudoknot compared to a hairpin, even as the ribosome applies increasing force, favors frameshifting. Do the characteristics of the mechanical unfolding of the mutant pseudoknots explain their relative frameshifting efficiency? No. We found no general correlation between mechanical properties, such as distance to the transition state for unfolding, and the variation in frameshifting efficiency (2%\u201346%). Chemical properties not mirrored in the mechanical characteristics must also be important. We did see that near 24 pN the frequency with which the pseudoknots induce frameshifting is inversely proportional to their rate constants of unfolding (Table 4). Though the correlation is only present over a very narrow range of forces it may prove to have some significance once the mechanochemistry of the ribosome is characterized.",

Commercially synthesized DNA oligonucleotides (Operon) corresponding to the RNA sequences studied here were inserted into the vector pBR322 (New England Biolabs) between the EcoRI and HindIII sites, creating a plasmid that was used to transform competent BL21 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). The plasmid was replicated by the bacteria and a DNA template for RNA transcription was removed from the plasmid by enzymatic digestion resulting in a template corresponding to the RNA sequence of the appropriate molecule plus approximately 500 DNA base-pairs on each side that correspond to the RNA sequence of the handle regions. The template was recovered by miniprep (Qiagen) and sequenced by the University of California Berkeley (UCB) sequencing facility. The DNA template was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) containing a T7 promoter sequence at the 5\u2032 end, and sequenced by the UCB sequencing facility. RNA molecules were transcribed from the DNA templates by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). The RNA was prepared as an optical tweezers construct by annealing the DNA handles to the single-stranded RNA handle regions. DNA handle A (pBR322 bases 3821 to 3) was amplified by PCR and then biotinylated at the 3\u2032 end using an exchange reaction by T4 DNA polymerase. The downstream primer used for PCR amplification of DNA handle B (pBR322 bases 30 to 628) was modified to have a terminal digoxigenin group. The biotin and digoxigenin allowed the RNA\u2013DNA handles flanking the RNA sequence to be attached to a streptavidin coated polystyrene bead (Spherotech) and an anti-digoxigenin coated polystyrene bead (Spherotech).",
