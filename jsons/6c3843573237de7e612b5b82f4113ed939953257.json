This is taken into account by the introduction of a factor of reduction of social interactions q, and by decreasing the transmission coecient of the disease accordingly. Evaluating q is a dicult question and one can ask if it makes sense to compute an average coecient q for a given population, in order to make predictions on the basic reproduction rate R 0 , the dynamics of the epidemic or the fraction of the population that will have been infected by the end of the epidemic. On a very simple example, we show that the computation of R 0 in a heterogeneous population is not reduced to the computation of an average q but rather to the direct computation of an average coecient R 0 . Even more interesting is the fact that, in a range of data compatible with the Covid-19 outbreak, the size of the epidemic is deeply modied by social heterogeneity, as is the height of the epidemic peak, while the date at which it is reached mainly depends on the average R 0 coecient. This short note is an application and a summary of the technical results that can be found in [4] .",

While a model with a single compartment and an average factor of reduction of social interactions predicts the extinction of the epidemic, a small group with high transmission factor \u03b2 k , even if numerically not very large (that is, with p k small), can spread the disease and trigger an outbreak. This is one of the possible explanations, probably among many other, why the statistical data were suggesting a pattern corresponding to a basic reproduction ratio larger than 1 in the initial stage of the lockdown rather than an exponential decay of the number of cases.",

For the same value of R 0 \u2248 1.5, the curve t \u2192 e(t) + i(t) is represented in red for a single group (this corresponds here to a factor of reduction of social interactions q \u2248 1.55) and in blue in the case of two groups (with parameters q 1 = 2.4, q 2 = 0.2 and p = 0.05). Note that the blue curve is the same as in Fig. 4 with p = 5%. Now, let us describe how the epidemic peak depends on the parameters in our two groups example. For a given value of \u03b2 2 , larger values of p mean a larger R 0 , with a linear dependence given by (2), a larger epidemic size (see Fig. 2 ), but also a larger epidemic peak (see Fig. 6 ).",

The goal of a lockdown is to reduce the basic reproduction ratio of the epidemic to a value less than 1 and drive the disease to extinction, or at least decrease it in such a way that the curve is attened. The eciency of the lockdown is achieved by a reduction of social interactions, which is measured by a factor q. Here we question whether such an average factor makes sense or not. Beyond the dicult issue of giving realistic values to q, we study the impact of social heterogeneities when the population is divided into groups for which q takes dierent values.",

The dynamics of the outbreak, for instance the height of the epidemic peak, is also changed. A model with only one group and tting the observed data in the initial phase of the outbreak will be more pessimistic concerning the epidemic outcomes than a heterogeneous model. This is even more true after lockdown when social distancing measures have been enforced, the lockdown being by its nature a creator of heterogeneity. In terms of public health, this also underlines the importance of targeting prevention measures on individuals with a high level of social interactions.
