            "text": "In the 1930s, coronaviruses were recognized as disease agents in animals.2 Thirty years later, coronaviruses were identified as agents of respiratory tract infections in humans. The first recognized HCoVs included 229E and OC43. Less well recognized strains, such as B814, OC16, OC37, and OC48, also were described but were not investigated further and to date little is known regarding their prevalence and associated clinical illnesses.3, 4, 5 Coronavirus-like particles also have been detected in stool as possible enteric pathogens, primarily in infants with gastroenteritis and necrotizing enterocolitis, but further characterization has been possible because viruses have not been culturable from these specimens.6, 7, 8 Dramatically, in 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV was identified as a novel respiratory pathogen responsible for a global outbreak of SARS. This outbreak lasted 9 months and ultimately resulted in 8098 people infected and 774 deaths.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Most experts believe SARS-CoV evolved from a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, with civet cats serving as intermediate hosts.14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Finding a novel HCoV initiated a renewed interest in CoV research and 2 years later, NL63 (referred to in various publications as NL and NH) and HKU1 were identified as newly recognized HCoVs.19, 20, 21 HCoV-NL63 has since been shown to have been present in human respiratory samples as early as 1981.22 How HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 relate to HCoVs originally described in the 1960s, such as B814, OC16, OC37, and OC48, or the enteric coronavirus-like particles detected in stool, is unclear.23\n",

However, based on studies of other respiratory viruses, it is likely that transmission occurs primarily via a combination of droplet and direct and indirect contact spread.31 Which mode is most important remains to be determined, and the possible role of aerosol spread needs further study. Droplet and direct contact spread are likely the most common modes of transmission for SARS-CoV, although evidence for indirect contact spread and aerosol spread also exists.32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 There is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV.40, 41\n",

Increasing antibody titers and symptomatic improvement during the second and third week are associated with a fall in the quantity of SARS-CoV, as measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).45, 59 Paradoxically, despite a fall in SARS-CoV viral load and a rise in SARS-specific antibodies, clinical deterioration is observed in some patients. This suggests that host immune responses likely are responsible for clinical deterioration.45 Indeed, SARS is associated with an elevation of IFN-\u03b3, inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-12 as well as elevations in neutrophil chemokine IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein-10.

These include viral entry and protease inhibiting agents, RNA interfering agents, and glycyrrhizin.119 However, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy of these treatments. This is noteworthy because controlled studies have not been performed for any of these agents, and there are reports of uneventful recovery for patients given supportive care alone. In the event that SARS-CoV re-emerges, clarification of the effectiveness of these treatments through controlled clinical trials will be needed.",
