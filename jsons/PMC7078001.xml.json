These mice are deficient in Ifitm1\u20133, \u20105 and \u20106 and are referred to as IfitmDel\u2212/\u2212.17 Whole\u2010genome transcriptome analysis of resting CD4+ T cells from spleens of IfitmDel\u2212/\u2212 mice showed that these cells had a Th1\u2010like transcriptional signature compared with their WT counterparts.13 To investigate if this difference was the result of changes in the immune environment of the cells, or the result of a CD4+ T\u2010cell\u2010intrinsic influence on T helper differentiation, we purified naive (CD62L+ CD44\u2212 CD25\u2212) CD4+ T cells from IfitmDel\u2212/\u2212 and WT littermates and carried out in vitro differentiation experiments in which we activated cells in Th\u2010skewing conditions. These in vitro experiments showed a clear bias in differentiation towards Th1.13 After 3 days in culture, a greater proportion of the IfitmDel\u2212/\u2212 CD4+ T cells cultured in Th0 and Th1 conditions expressed Tbet than WT, whereas in Th2 conditions the proportion of Gata3+ cells was reduced. Expression of the Th1\u2010associated molecules Cxcr3 and CD54 and expression of Tbx21 and Il27ra were also increased in the IfitmDel\u2212/\u2212 cells cultured in Th1\u2010skewing conditions compared with their WT counterparts. Bias towards Th1 differentiation was also demonstrated by cytokine production: IfitmDel\u2212/\u2212 cells produced less interleukin\u20104 (IL\u20104) and IL\u201013 than WT when cultured in Th2\u2010skewing conditions, but more IFN\u2010\u03b3 when cultured in Th1\u2010skewing conditions. Hence, the absence of the IFITM family of proteins led to an overall bias towards Th1 differentiation and a reduction in Th2 differentiation when purified naive CD4+ T cells were activated, suggesting that one or all of the IFITM proteins inhibit Th1 differentiation but promote Th2 differentiation in a T\u2010cell\u2010intrinsic manner13 (illustrated in Fig. 2a). As Ifitm2 expression rapidly increased on activation, IFITM2 might be the most likely candidate family member for this function.",

Given their presence in endolysosomal intracellular vesicles, this theory suggests that IFITM proteins are involved in internalization, trafficking or degradation of some cytokine receptors or signalling pathway components, but not others. In support of this, IFN receptor signalling involves internalization by clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis,84 so the presence of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the membrane of late endosomes may modulate IFN signalling.",

Exons are represented by vertical coloured rectangles, arrows below indicate the direction of transcription.4, 18 (b) The cartoon illustrates the proposed models of IFITM protein topology. First model suggests a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) between two transmembrane domains (TM) with extracellular C' and N' terminal domains. Second model shows a CIL between two intramembrane domains (IM) with intracellular C' and N' terminal domains. The third model proposes a CIL between IM and a TM with an intracellular N' and an extracellular C' terminal domain. These three topology models are predominant but alternative models have been proposed for specific IFITM protein topology depending on their function.1 (c) The cartoon illustrates the cellular localization of IFITM1\u20133 proteins. IFITM proteins have been shown to span several cellular membranes. IFITM1 is found in different intracellular compartments from IFITM2 and IFITM3 with little overlap.47, 59 IFITM1\u20133 can all be found on the plasma membrane, but IFITM1 has been shown to be the predominant IFITM associated with the plasma membrane and is also found in early endosomes.35, 60 IFITM2 and IFITM3 are predominately located intracellularly in late endosomes and lysosomes and co\u2010localize with Rab7, CD63 and lysosomal\u2010associated membrane protein (LAMP1).21 The illustrations in this figure are cartoons that are not drawn to scale.",
