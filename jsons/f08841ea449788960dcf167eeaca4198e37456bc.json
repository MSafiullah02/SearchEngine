            "text": "The process of cell death as a result of exposure to pseudorabies virus (PRV) in cultured cells was examined and specific features characteristic of apoptosis were observed. At early times of infection, externalization of membrane phospholipid phophatidylserine was detected by flow cytometry analysis. During the infection process, caspase 3-like protease activity was induced and the activity increased in a time dependent manner. Cellular DNA degradation was demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Morphologic changes of the nucleus that included chromatin condensation and margination to the periphery of the nucleus were evident in electron microscopy analysis. These biochemical and morphologic changes demonstrated that, during PRV replication, the host cell was induced to undergo apoptosis. * Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is a process of cellular suicide that occurs under normal physiological conditions [3] . It is a mode of cell death commonly associated with cell turnover, tissue homeostasis, aging and embryogenesis. There are specific morphologic and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis [3, 14] . They include cell shrinkage, loss of cell-cell contact, chromatin aggregation, nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, partition of nucleus and cytoplasm into membrane-bound vesicles. Specific nucleases are activated and they cause degradation of chromosomal DNA. The degraded DNA may be present as high molecular weight fragments or cleaved into internucleosomal oligomers [2, 6, 18, 29, 31] . Although some of the nucleases that are active during apoptosis have been identified [1, 9, 10, 20, 25] , the factors and mechanisms involved in DNA fragmentation are still unclear.",

The anti-apoptotic activities enable the virus to block premature death of the host cell for the propagation of progeny viruses or establishment of persistence, and the pro-apoptotic activities ensure efficient dissemination of progeny viruses to neighboring cells. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) belongs to the alphaherpes virus subfamily and the association of PRV infection with apoptosis has not been established.

The experiments were carried out at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 and the virus titer was quantitated by a plaque assay previously described [5] . One of the earliest morphologic changes during apoptosis is the translocation of membrane phospholipid phophatidylserine (PS) from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane [17] . Simultaneous staining of cells with annexin V, which binds PS, and propidium iodide (PI), which is excluded by viable cells, allows differentiation of cells undergoing apoptosis (annexin V positive, PI negative) or necrosis (annexin V positive, PI positive) [28] . Previously, we have demonstrated that progeny PRV start to appear 8 h after infection of MDBK cells [4] . Therefore, we analysed the externalization of PS of MDBK cells during the early stages of PRV infection. Infected cultures at different times postinfection (p.i.) were analysed by flow cytometry after staining with FITC-annexin V and/or PI. Dexamethasone, which has been widely used to induce apoptosis in many cell types, was included as a positive control [26] . In comparison to untreated cells, the dexamethasone-treated and PRV-infected cultures showed an increased number of annexin V positive and PI negative cells soon after exposure to dexamethasone or PRV (Fig. 1) , indicating an increased externalization of PS in viable cells.",

            "text": "In this report, we examined whether PRV can induce apoptosis in MDBK cells during virus replication. Several features characteristic of apoptosis were detected. The morphologic changes detected by flow cytometry and electron microscopy showed externalization of PS and chromatin condensation and margination, respectively. Cellular DNA fragmentation, considered a hallmark of programmed cell death as the result of endonucleolytic activity, can exist in several forms, including large fragments of 30-500 kilo-bp, 180-200 bp oligomeric internucleosomal fragments and single-stranded DNA breaks [3, 21, 29, 30] . The relationships between these types of DNA degradation are not clear. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that PRV could induce DNA fragmentation in MDBK as well as in ST cells. However, PRV did not induce a distinct oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage pattern as exhibited by other alphaherpes viruses, e.g. herpes simplex virus type 1 [15, 16] , varicella-zoster virus [24] and bovine herpes virus type 1 [12] . Activation of caspase 3-like activity, commonly associated with programmed cell death, was detected. Our experiments showed that caspase 3-like activity increased in a time dependent manner after PRV infection of MDBK cells. Thus, the morphologic and biochemical results from the above experiments demonstrated that PRV can induce apoptosis in cultured cells.",
