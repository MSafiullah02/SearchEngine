Both epidemiological and laboratory studies have shown that ambient temperature could affect the transmission and survival of coronaviruses. This study aimed to determine whether the temperature is an essential factor in the infection caused by this novel coronavirus. Methods: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 122 cities were collected between January 23, 2020, to February 29, 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to explore the nonlinear relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We also used a piecewise linear regression to determine the relationship in detail. Results: The exposure-response curves suggested that the relationship between mean temperature and COVID-19 confirmed cases was approximately linear in the range of b3\u00b0C and became flat above 3\u00b0C. When mean temperature (lag0-14) was below 3\u00b0C, each 1\u00b0C rise was associated with a 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209-6.513) increase in the daily number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. These findings were robust in our sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our results indicate that mean temperature has a positive linear relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases with a threshold of 3\u00b0C.

Tan et al. (2005) found that the optimum environmental temperature related to SARS cases was from 16\u00b0C to 28\u00b0C based on data from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan. Moreover, Bi et al. (2007) reported that temperature had a negative relationship with SARS transmission in Hong Kong and Beijing in 2003. A laboratory study using surrogate viruses to investigate the effect of temperature on coronavirus survival on surfaces showed that viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 20\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C (Casanova et al., 2010) . Another laboratory study found that coronavirus on smooth surfaces was stable for over 5 days when temperature at 22\u00b0C-25\u00b0C, and virus viability was rapidly lost at higher temperatures (e.g., 38\u00b0C) (Chan et al., 2011 ). Van Doremalen et al. (2013 also observed that MERS-CoV was less stable at high temperature. In brief, most studies showed that there was an optimum temperature for coronavirus and high temperature was harmful to its viability. However, this paper could not observe a negative effect of high temperature on COVID-19 infection.
