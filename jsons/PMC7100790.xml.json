During the past 35 years, the global emergence of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) has been reported [12, 13]. This resistance is particularly documented to \u03b2-lactams, and the prevalence of penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSSP) has been reported in several regions of the world [14\u201317]. In Tunisia, there are no available data about the epidemiological characteristics and prognostic of pneumococcal CAP admitted in ICUs. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and microbiological features of pneumococcal CAP and to determine its prognostic factors.",

The definitive diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia was considered if there was clinical and radiologic pneumonia with one of the following conditions: (1) blood cultures positive for S. pneumoniae; (2) pleural fluid cultures yielding S. pneumoniae; (3) validated sputum at direct examination (\u226525 leucocytes per field and <10 epithelial cells per field) and cultures with \u2265107 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml S. pneumoniae; (4) endotracheal aspirate (ETA) cultures with \u2265106 cfu/ml S. pneumoniae; (5) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures with \u2265104 cfu/ml S. pneumoniae; (6) plugged telescoping catheter (PTC) cultures with \u2265103 cfu/ml S. pneumoniae; and (7) positive pneumococcal urinary antigen test result (Binax NOW-test; Binax, Portland, ME, USA). Diagnosis of atypical microorganisms was performed by means of paired serology at admission and at the third week thereafter: these microorganisms included Chlamydia pneumoniae (diagnosis in the case of fourfold increase in IgG titers and/or initial single IgM titer \u22651:32), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (diagnosis in the case of fourfold increase in IgG titers and/or any initial positive IgM titer), as well as Legionella pneumophila serotypes 1\u20136 and Coxiella burnetii (diagnosis in the case of fourfold increase in IgG titer). The diagnosis of L. pneumophila serotype 1 was also performed by positive urinary antigen.

Initially designed for a prognosis evaluation, this score has become a tool for deciding CAP hospitalization. However, several limitations are noteworthy. First, hypoxemia, whose \u201cweight\u201d is only 10, remains an important factor of severity, while a 71-year-old man passes immediately to IPS class III only by the \u201cweight\u201d of his age. Second, its use in other populations or in countries with different health system needs validation. Finally, socioeconomic condition and psychological and digestive disorders are not taken into account. In our study, the decision for ICU hospitalization was based mainly on the clinical judgment of the physician, taking into account the socioeconomic condition of the patient. Another prognostic score is the CURB-65, widely used and adopted by the British Thoracic Society [21, 25]. This score is much easier to use and more practical than that of the IPS score. For the ICU admission criteria of patients with CAP, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommends admission to intensive care if the patient has two minor signs or one major sign [26]. The ATS criteria seem more practical and easy to use. Indeed, the majority of our patients had at least one criterion of the ATS (acute respiratory failure in 94% of cases, MV in 47% of cases, bilateral radiologic involvement in 39.4%, multilobar involvement in 48.5% of patients, and septic shock in 26.5% of cases).",

Recently, Mera et al. have compared the rates of susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to penicillin before and after the 2008 revised CLSI breakpoint. In this study, the penicillin susceptibility level was 92.2% in 2008 (11,185 strains), if the new breakpoints for intravenous antibiotic use and nonmeningitis syndromes such as bacteremia or pneumonia are applied, whereas using the old definition, the proportion was 58.8% [29]. In our study, the PNSSP rate was 24.8% if the old breakpoints are applied, whereas all stains were susceptible to penicillin if we referred to the present CLSI breakpoints. The resistance of S. pneumoniae to macrolides is markedly increasing worldwide, exceeding 50% in some studies [12, 13].",

The third and most important is that the impact of monotherapy on mortality is not clearly proven. Finally, the combination results in increased cost of care. In our study, more than half of the patients received empiric monotherapy, explained, first, by the fact that the choice of initial antibiotic therapy has not been guided throughout the study period by any rigorous protocol and, second, that combination therapy has been conducted mainly in the presence of shock and/or the need for VM.",

The report of the most recent study showed that in a group of nonsevere patients, there is no difference in mortality between monotherapy versus combination therapy. In contrast, in a group of patients with septic shock, there is a significant reduction in mortality in favor of the combination therapy (23.4% vs. 55%; P = 0.001) [33]. In our results, we did not observe any significant difference in mortality between patients treated with monotherapy and those treated by combination therapy. Because the initial treatment included at least one antibiotic effective against S. pneumoniae (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefotaxime and/or levofloxacin), the impact of this factor on the prognosis cannot be analyzed.",

However, several similar studies, including epidemiological studies, have provided relevant data to the medical scientific community. Second, the study period is very wide (January 1999\u2013August 2008). However, during this period the epidemiology of bacterial CAP and the acquisition of antibiotic resistance have evolved and changed over time. Our diagnostic and therapeutic strategy may also have changed in this long period. Third, the antimicrobial susceptibility testing used the E test method and not the broth microdilution test, which is now considered the gold standard method. The MIC was not performed for all antimicrobial against S. pneumoniae isolates. Also, the MIC50 and MIC90 were not performed for any antimicrobial. Investigation to detect atypical pathogens was insufficient. All these limits are mainly the result of the lack of resources in a developing country such as ours. Finally, this is a single-center study. Indeed, the epidemiology and management of CAP, particularly those cases requiring hospitalization in intensive care, vary from one country to another and within a country could vary from one region to another. So, the results of this study cannot be extrapolated to other regions of Tunisia and other countries nearby.",
