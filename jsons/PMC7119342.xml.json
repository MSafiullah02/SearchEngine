The exclusion criteria were as follows: middle ear effusion in either ear; any infection requiring antimicrobial therapy; any use of antimicrobial agents or steroids during the preceding 2 weeks; previous adenoidectomy or placement of tympanostomy tubes; any known immunodeficiency; Down syndrome; cleft palate; and the use of any investigational drug during the preceding 4 weeks.

The children were examined at the study clinic within 48 hours of the onset of URI. The middle ear status was carefully examined by pneumatic otoscopy and additionally by tympanometry whenever the child was cooperative. A nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was obtained by using a disposable mucus extractor (UNO, Maersk Medical). The eligible children were randomly allocated to receive either intranasal aqueous FP (50 \u03bcg per nostril twice daily; a total daily dose of 200 \u03bcg) or an identical placebo for 7 days (both drugs supplied by GlaxoWellcome, UK). The first doses were given at the study clinic by the parents, who were carefully taught to administer the medication into the nostrils of the child. The parents were provided with a diary card for daily recording of their child\u2019s symptoms (rhinitis, cough, fever >37.5\u00b0C, and earache), all medications given, and possible adverse events. The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period or additionally, in the meantime, whenever the parents suspected AOM. The study physician inquired about compliance to medication and the occurrence of adverse events at each visit and at the end of the study period when the diary cards were collected. All visits were free of charge, and the families were not compensated for participation in the study.",

Positive controls and several negative controls were included in each PCR analysis. Contamination of the specimens was prevented by strict precautions, including the use of separate rooms during each step of the RT-PCR assay. Nucleic acid sequences for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected by RT-PCR assays with subsequent time-resolved fluorometric microwell hybridization assay22, 23 or gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining.24 A cutoff value for a hybridization-positive specimen was 5 times the mean value of water template controls. A hybridization-positive specimen was identified as rhinovirus or enterovirus if there was at least a 10-fold difference between the fluorescence values from rhinovirus- and enterovirus-specific probes. A second RT-PCR analysis was done for aliquots of RNA from specimens that yielded a visible band corresponding with the expected amplicon size on the agarose gel but which gave a negative or dual-positive hybridization result. Using another PCR primer pair, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses could be discriminated by amplicon size.24 If the picornavirus-positive amplicons from the first PCR could not be resolved into rhinoviruses or enteroviruses by the hybridization assay or by the second RT-PCR analysis, they were regarded as unclassified picornaviruses. In addition, 29 specimens that were negative according to all the other methods described were tested by an in-house RT-PCR assay for human coronavirus strains 229E and OC-43 (M. Waris, unpublished data). The primers and probes were modified from primers and nucleotide sequences either described earlier25, 26, 27 or available from GeneBank and synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). PCR products were detected by using agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Bands corresponding to 229E and OC-43 amplicon sizes were identified on the gel, and the results were confirmed by Southern hybridization.",

In an experimental study of rhinovirus infection, Gustafson et al30 showed that although oral prednisone therapy decreased local kinin concentrations in the nasopharynx, it did not alleviate the clinical symptoms of the volunteers. In another experimental study18 combination of intranasal beclomethasone and oral prednisone had only a modest and short-lived effect on the clinical symptoms of the patients infected with rhinoviruses. Recently, Puhakka et al31, 32 studied the efficacy of intranasally administered FP in the treatment of natural common cold in otherwise healthy young adults and reported that this treatment neither decreased the incidence of sinusitis nor diminished the clinical symptoms of the patients. The results of all these studies, including the present one, clearly indicate that steroid treatment alone may not be effective in reducing the severity or duration of the symptoms of URI or in preventing the development of common complications, such as AOM or sinusitis.",

This observation may have substantial clinical implications because rhinoviruses are the most common causative agents of URI33 and steroids are widely used in the treatment of various conditions in both children and adults. No explanations are readily available for the increased risk of AOM caused by FP treatment during rhinovirus infections. Systemic effects of FP are very unlikely because the systemic bioavailability of this drug after intranasal administration is very low (<2%).34 In adults the use of steroids during rhinovirus infections has been shown to increase the viral titers in the nasopharynx30 and result in prolonged shedding of rhinoviruses.32 In this way steroids might intensify, rather than suppress, the inflammatory reaction in the nasopharynx, which could lead to more severe dysfunction of the eustachian tube. This theory may not, however, sufficiently explain our present observation because steroids have been reported to increase viral shedding also in infections with causes other than rhinovirus.35, 36, 37 Furthermore, a recent in vitro study suggested that steroids have no direct effect on rhinovirus replication in cultured respiratory epithelial cells.38 We found no effect of FP on the incidence of AOM in children with URI caused by enteroviruses or any other viruses. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that intranasal FP might even prevent AOM during some viral infections because the incidence of many viral infections was too low for any meaningful analysis. Taken together, our findings suggest that the effect of FP, and perhaps that of steroids in general, may vary significantly during different viral infections.",

Despite the high recovery rate of viruses, the relative distribution of different types of viruses in this study is not generalizable to unselected groups of children because we had to exclude almost one third of all children brought to the study clinic because they already had AOM. Also, it is probable that the parents of the sickest children did not want to participate in any clinical trial. These reasons might at least partly explain the low rates of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses in the study children. In spite of these limitations, our results suggest that enteroviruses have a prominent role in the cause of URI in children. Although enteroviruses have been identified as a cause of URI in children previously,39 descriptions of enterovirus infections have mostly concentrated on large outbreaks with severely ill patients,40 and URI is infrequently included in the list of manifestations of enterovirus infections.41\n",
