The overall risk for CHD is determined by multiple parameters such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, coagulopathies, diet, and sedentary lifestyle as well as hereditary genetic variations (Roger et al. 2012; Prospective Studies Collaboration 1995) . These risk factors account for more than 90% of the population-attributable risk for CVD (Yusuf et al. 2004) , and up to 80% of CVD could be prevented by prevention or treatment of these risk modalities (Mendis et al. 2011) . Dyslipidemia, mainly hypercholesterolemia, plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis being responsible for the development and progression of CHD, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease (Roger et al. 2012 ). Out of nine independent risk factors for CVD, dyslipidemia is associated with the highest population-attributable risk, and 55% of CVD cases can directly be assigned to lipids (Yusuf et al. 2004 ). Consequently, lowering or modifying plasma lipid levels has become one of the most important options for treatment and prevention to combat the leading \"killing disease no. 1\" in the world (Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults 2001), taking 17.1 million lives a year (Rozman and Monostory 2010).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 301, "end": 320, "text": "(Stone et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF207"}, {"start": 374, "end": 395, "text": "(Graham et al. 2007a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 396, "end": 419, "text": "Lloyd-Jones et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 480, "end": 499, "text": "(Mendis et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 725, "end": 744, "text": "(Roger et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 745, "end": 784, "text": "Prospective Studies Collaboration 1995)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 876, "end": 895, "text": "(Yusuf et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 990, "end": 1010, "text": "(Mendis et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1235, "text": "(Roger et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1433, "text": "(Yusuf et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Dyslipidemia is defined as a spectrum of deviations from lipid homeostasis characterized by elevations in plasma concentrations of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), apolipoproteins B and triglycerides (TG), as well as decreased plasma levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) or apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA-I). Primary dyslipidemias result from mutations in proteins involved in critical pathways involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism such as the LDL receptor (familial hypercholesterolemia FH), apolipoprotein B (familial defective ApoB-100), or PCSK9 (variant FH). Most cases of dyslipidemia are of secondary cause, resulting from other diseases or health conditions such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, or a sedentary lifestyle with overcaloric nutrition, decreased physical exercise, or excessive alcohol consumption. Aging of the general population also contributes to the growing incidence of hypercholesterolemia because plasma levels of LDL-C exert a natural rise with increasing lifetime (Schaefer et al. 1994) . Plasma cholesterol levels are lowest immediately after birth with 50 mg/dL total cholesterol and 30 mg/dL LDL-C (Parker et al. 1983; Dietschy and Turley 2004) . With onset of breast feeding, total cholesterol levels rapidly increase to 180 mg/dL due to the high cholesterol content of breast milk. Epidemiological studies [NHANES III] show that mean total cholesterol levels in adolescents aged 4-19 is 165 mg/dL; during lifetime cholesterol levels gradually increase, and in healthy subjects consuming typical Western diets, mean total cholesterol levels rise to around 200 mg/dL (Cohen et al. 2010; Martin et al. 1986 ). Compared to \"wild-forging,\" non-primates with LDL-C levels of 30-50 mg/dL and total cholesterol of 70-100 mg/dL humans have much higher plasma cholesterol concentrations.

The major causative role of elevated levels of LDL cholesterol in atherosclerotic vascular disease has been unequivocally proven by clinical landmark studies where reduction of plasma LDL cholesterol levels by statins -inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study Group 1994; Downs et al. 1998; Shepherd et al. 1995 ) -or surgical interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (Buchwald et al. 1990 ) reduced cardiovascular morbidity and death.

In the year 2000, 341,745 fewer death cases from coronary heart disease compared to 1980 were registered in the United States after introduction of statin therapy into clinical practice, whereby a percentage of 24% could directly be aligned to a decrease of total plasma cholesterol levels (Ford et al. 2007) . Similarly, a 35% decrease in CHD mortality was reported in Canada between 1994 and 2005, 48% of this reduction being associated with improved control of lipids and blood pressure (Wijeysundera et al. 2010 ). The mean age of participants in these statin trials was 63 years (Wijeysundera et al. 2010) , raising the question whether the efficacy of LDL-C lowering therapy in reduction of CHD events would be higher if initiated earlier in life based on the observational studies with a correlation of atherosclerotic lesions to plasma cholesterol levels with increasing lifetime (Strong and McGill 1969; Newman et al. 1986; McNamara et al. 1971; McGill et al. 2000) , and the findings that elevated cholesterol levels in early adulthood are associated with CVD in later life (Pearson et al. 1990 ). The observation that lowering of LDL-C levels can stop the progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions is obviously linearly correlated with plasma LDL-C levels achieved, indicating that more intensive lowering of LDL-C leads to less plaque progression which suggests that lowering of elevated LDL-C levels early in life should be more effective in the prevention/progression of CHD/CVD than onset of therapy in later life (Ference and Mahajan 2013) . Despite the quantum leap in the treatment of dyslipidemias by the introduction of statins into clinical practice, major gaps in the management of lipid disorders persist. Statins are undoubtedly the 1st-line therapy for the prevention of CVD in almost all population groups except those with severe renal or cardiac failure (Saydah et al. 2004 ) but do not address the entire spectrum of CVD risk, and the residual risk of major vascular events remains high with more than 20% over 5 years despite optimal management of LDL-C levels with statins (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration et al. 2010) . However, only 30-70% of high-risk patients will attain standard LDL-C targets recommended in the guidelines; for example, patients with FH and those with mixed dyslipidemias secondary to the metabolic syndrome are at an increased risk due to other risk factors such as low HDL, high TGs, or non-lipid risk factors (Barnett et al. 2013) . Particularly, in patients with complex metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus, significant improvements in the control of risk factors are necessary; only 7.3% of adults with diabetes in the NHANES 1999-2000 survey attained the recommended targets for treatment of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension (Saydah et al. 2004 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 199, "end": 219, "text": "(Taylor et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 565, "end": 583, "text": "(Ford et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 765, "end": 790, "text": "(Wijeysundera et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 859, "end": 885, "text": "(Wijeysundera et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF239"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1187, "text": "(Strong and McGill 1969;", "ref_id": "BIBREF208"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1207, "text": "Newman et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1229, "text": "McNamara et al. 1971;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1249, "text": "McGill et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1379, "text": "(Pearson et al. 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 1810, "end": 1836, "text": "(Ference and Mahajan 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2163, "end": 2182, "text": "(Saydah et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2451, "text": "Collaboration et al. 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2768, "end": 2789, "text": "(Barnett et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3106, "end": 3125, "text": "(Saydah et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Low-Density Lipoproteins and CVD Risk"}, {"text": "The relationship between total plasma cholesterol and CHD risk is continuous but not linear; the risk for CHD rises more strongly at higher LDL-C levels (Schaefer et al. 1994) , indicating the involvement of further risk factors. However, unequivocal evidence from randomized clinical trials that reduction of other risk factors like low HDL or HDL-C, elevated TG, or non-lipid influences like hypertension, inflammation, and diabetes reduces the risk of CHD and therefore the number of patients with CVD is only available for hypertension (Sever et al. 2003) . In a recent meta-analysis of 46 lipid GWAS-studies with more than 100,000 individuals of European descent, 95 genetic loci associated with serum lipid traits were identified, many of them harboring genes involved in lipid metabolism like HMG-CoA reductase, NPC1L1, cholesterol-7\u03b1 hydroxylase, or ANPTL3/4 proteins, all of them being targets of available lipid-lowering drugs, but many other newly identified genes representing possible new risk factors or pharmacological targets to monitor or treat CAD (Teslovich et al. 2010) . HDL is a mediator of cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to the liver and is considered as an important regulator of CHD risk (Parker et al. 1983; Dietschy and Turley 2004; Cohen et al. 2010) with an inverse relationship of HDL levels to CHD risk (Martin et al. 1986) . HDL-C is an independent risk factor for CVD and superior than LDL-C as a predictor of CV events (Sever et al. 2003; Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group 2002; Colhoun et al. 2004 ). An increase of HDL-C by 1 mg/dL (0,026 mmol/L) was associated with a reduction of CVD risk by 2-3% (Curb et al. 2004) . Paradoxically, despite the unequivocal role of HDL as an independent risk factor for CVD events, the failure of recent clinical trials with drugs aiming to increase HDL-C levels may suggest that the functionality of the HDL particles rather than the height of HDL-C levels is more relevant for the cardio-and atheroprotective efficacy of HDL particles. Due to the complex metabolism of HDL particles involving many different proteins and interaction with other lipoprotein particles, the impact of mutations in key proteins of the HDL-particle pathways and CV risk is not fully understood today. The role of HDL as a predictor of CV diseases is still valid in the sense that HDL-C is a predictor of incident CV events in the setting of secondary prevention in individuals who have already been diagnosed with CVD (Rader and Hovingh 2014) . As a conclusion, low HDL-C plasma level may serve as a strong biomarker for CVD risk but does not predict HDL functionality or composition. Consequently, measuring of HDL-C as a metric for monitoring pharmacological efficacy for reduction of CVD events by modulation of HDL particles is not sufficient to evaluate and predict of the efficacy of a drug approach elevating HDL levels (Kingwell et al. 2014) . Recently, the results of a population study involving 2,924 adults free of CVD with a mean follow-up of 9.4 years investigating the association between HDL levels and functional parameters to primary endpoint of CVD (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization or death from CVD) were published (Rohatgi et al. 2014) . Whereas baseline levels of HDL were not found to be associated with CV events, the cholesterol efflux capacity (from macrophages) as a key component of the RCT process was identified as a reliable biomarker being strongly and inversely associated with the incidence of CV events in a population cohort. Little correlation was found between cholesterol efflux capacity and traditional CV risk factors, coronary artery calcium, or markers of inflammation. Cholesterol efflux from macrophages is predominantly catalyzed by ABCA1, underlining the importance of this ABC transporter for RCT. From these findings, it can be concluded that measurements of macrophage-specific cholesterol efflux using fluorescently labeled cholesterol could be used in the future as a reliable method to assess the severity of atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences and to predict the efficacy of a drug approach affecting HDL metabolism for reduction of CVD risk.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 153, "end": 175, "text": "(Schaefer et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 540, "end": 559, "text": "(Sever et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1089, "text": "(Teslovich et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF218"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1248, "text": "(Parker et al. 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1274, "text": "Dietschy and Turley 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1293, "text": "Cohen et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1369, "text": "(Martin et al. 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1487, "text": "(Sever et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1536, "text": "Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group 2002;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1556, "text": "Colhoun et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1659, "end": 1677, "text": "(Curb et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2493, "end": 2517, "text": "(Rader and Hovingh 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 2902, "end": 2924, "text": "(Kingwell et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 3238, "end": 3259, "text": "(Rohatgi et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "High-Density Lipoproteins and CVD"}, {"text": "Regarding a causative role of TG for CVD events, the picture is as well not really clear. Observational epidemiological studies and clinical trials using drugs targeting elevated TG levels and low HDL-C levels indicate a causative and predictive role of elevated TG plasma levels for the development of primary CHD. A recent systematic review and meta-regression analysis of 40 randomized controlled trials of lipid-modifying drugs with CHD events as outcome revealed that changes in plasma TG levels are predictive of CV events in randomized controlled clinical trials being significantly in primary prevention populations but not in secondary prevention populations (Stauffer et al. 2013) . Because plasma TG levels and HDL-C are metabolically and mechanistically interconnected via lipid metabolizing and exchanging proteins like CETP, LPL, or EL, it is methodically difficult to determine the relative contribution of either TG or HDL-C on CVD risk. Loss-of-function mutations in the ABCA1 transporter decrease plasma HDL-C without an effect on TG levels or risk for CHD arguing against a direct relationship between HDL-C and CHD risk. As a potential explanation for the difference in the prediction power of changes in TG levels for CV events in primary and secondary prevention trials elevated plasma TG levels could still be a risk factor in secondary populations but of lower importance for the total risk of coronary events.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 668, "end": 690, "text": "(Stauffer et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Plasma Triglycerides and CVD"}, {"text": "Today the armamentarium introduced in medical practice for the treatment of lipid disorders comprises five different modes of action and respective molecular targets with overall 24 different drug entities on the market, some of them available only in selected countries. The majority of approaches focus on the reduction of LDL-C levels by inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitorsstatins), interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (bile acid sequestrants), or inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe). Nicotinic acid and derivatives thereof as well as agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor PPAR-\u03b1 (fibrates) are efficacious drugs to increase HDL-C levels and to decrease elevated TG levels. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of these drug classes with regard to their activity on plasma lipid parameters.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 779, "end": 786, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Current Treatment of Dyslipidemia"}, {"text": "The molecular target of statins is the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway from mevalonate to cholesterol, sterols, isoprenoids, and other lipids like dolichol and ubiquinone. For a detailed overview about statins, some of the recent review articles are recommended (Sirtori 2014; Shitara and Sugiyama 2006) . Statins are competitive enzyme inhibitors competing with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA for the catalytic binding site, thereby reducing biosynthesis rate of mevalonate and its downstream products like cholesterol. The decrease in the intracellular cholesterol regulatory pool leads to an upregulation of LDL receptors in the hepatocyte plasma membrane, leading to an increased clearance rate of LDL particles from the blood and therefore a fall of plasma LDL-C levels. Overall, statins reduce LDL-C levels by 17-55%, concomitantly with an increase of HDL-C by 1-10% and a decrease of TG by 2-28% (Vigna and Fellin 2010; Toth 2010 ; Ewang-Emukowhate and Wierzbicki 2013) ( Table 2) . Based on dosage, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are the most potent statins; the more polar compounds pravastatin and rosuvastatin are not or only metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly Cyp3A4, and are therefore less prone to drug-drug interactions with other medications due to cytochrome P450 metabolism. With high-dose therapy of statins, reduction of LDL-C up to 60% can be achieved. The findings however that whenever the statin dose is doubled LDL-C levels are reduced by only additional 6% (\"the role of 6%\") limits the clinical efficacy of statin use because of a steep increase in the incidence of adverse side effects by high statin doses; elevations of plasma transaminase levels and muscle toxicity by myalgia or severe rhabdomyolysis have been associated with high statin doses, thereby limiting the tolerable dose of a statin and the achievable reduction of plasma LDL-C levels. In addition to the beneficial effects of statins on plasma lipid profiles, further activities of statins are discussed to contribute to their efficacy in reduction of CVD events, but a final proof of the causative role of these pleiotropic statin effects still has to be proven: statins improve endothelial function leading to vasodilation (F\u20ac orstermann and Li 2011), inhibit inflammatory processes with reduction of circulating CRP levels (Plenge et al. 2002) , as well as stabilize plaques maybe by inhibition of myocyte infiltration and inhibition of metalloproteinase secretion (Massaro et al. 2010) . Since inhibition of the biosynthesis cascade to cholesterol by statins occurs at a very early step, a potential risk was seen in this approach due to the decrease of other lipids like ubiquinone and dolichol and manifestation of these decreases of non-sterol lipids in adverse side effects in different organs including the liver, muscle, eye, or brain. Today, after more than 25 years of broad clinical use with millions of patients treated, (Jackevicius et al. 2002) statins can be considered as very effective and safe drugs; currently more than 25 million American people with dyslipidemia are taking statins, and according to a recent recommendation for use, another 13 million are expected to benefit from statin treatment; for all patients with known CVD, the new guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association for the management of cholesterol recommend statin treatment regardless of their LDL-C levels (Pencina et al. 2014 ). If the public health guidelines being currently discussed in the USA and UK would be fully implemented, one third of the middle-aged and adult population in these countries will be recommended for statin therapy (Pencina et al. 2014) . Safety and tolerance of statin treatment is good with the exception of myalgia as the major adverse side effect. Indeed, statin-induced myalgia is a very frequent phenomenon in clinical practice observed in 15-20% of patients treated with statins (Toth et al. 2008) , whereas fortunately, the frequency of the severe and lifethreatening rhabdomyolysis is low (1 out of 7,428 patients treated) (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaborators et al. 2008) . Statins are taken up in the liver into hepatocytes by the organic anion transporting polypeptide OATP1B, and it was found that genetic variants of the SLCO1B1 gene are associated with the risk of myopathy upon statin treatment (Carr et al. 2013 ). Some of these variants exert a diminished affinity and transport activity for statins, leading to a reduced hepatic uptake resulting in higher blood levels and increased muscle exposure with an increased off-target activity at the neuromuscular endplate: statins are powerful inhibitors of chloride channels at muscle cell membranes (Pierno et al. 2006 ) potentially leading to paralysis; additional mechanism possibly being involved in statin-induced myopathy are diminished ubiquinone levels in plasma and muscle due to inhibition of their synthesis in the liver, induction of atrogen-1 being involved in skeletal muscle atrophy (Hanai et al. 2007 ), or direct antagonistic effects of statins on muscle differentiation (Martini et al. 2009 ). Mild elevation of serum transaminase occurs in only 1-4% of statin-treated patients dose-related, indicating a high liver safety of statins (Vigna and Fellin 2010) . Evidences for a slightly increased incidence for type 2 diabetes and acute renal failure were reported from observational data: 1 additional case of type 2 diabetes may occur for every 225 individuals treated with statins for 2 years, indicating a 20-30% increase risk to develop diabetes (Sattar et al. 2010) . Acute renal failure maybe a dose-related adverse side effect of statins of low incidence (Dormuth et al. 2013) . During development of statins, cataracts were an issue due to findings from dog studies; a recent retrospective analysis gave evidence for a slightly increased incidence for cataract formation in patients treated with statins (Leuschen et al. 2013) . Today there are no evidences regarding early concerns that statin use may impair cognitive functions (Shepherd et al. 2002) , but in contrast, patients treated with statins were shown to have a reduced risk to develop Alzheimer's disease (Corrao et al. 2013) . As well, no evidence for an increased risk for cancer or cancer mortality was found for treatment with statins (Ridker 2014 ). The introduction of inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the statins, into clinical practice has dramatically changed the landscape and treatment regimens for the treatment of lipid disorders. Coronary events and stroke can be reduced by 25-30% and 10-15%, respectively (Law et al. 2003) , and several metaanalyses of statin trial revealed reduction of CVD risk for each 1 mmol/L LDL-lowering by 21% (Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaborators et al. 2012 ) and of overall mortality by 14%, respectively (Taylor et al. 2013 ).

Cholestyramine and colestipol are used in daily dosages up to 30 g, whereas recommended daily dose of colesevelam is 3.75 g; the high necessary doses of cholestyramine and colestipol are caused by occupation of the majority of the anion-binding sites by chloride anions in competition to anionic bile acids. Whereas cholestyramine and colestipol show a preference for dihydroxy bile acids, colesevelam binds bile acids by both ionic and hydrophobic interactions, thereby increasing binding affinity and specificity resulting in significantly lower necessary dose. The treatment with sequestrants is safe, and due to their nonsystemic mode of action within the lumen of the intestine, sequestrants do not show systemic toxic effects; because of their non-absorbability, they can also be used in pregnancy. The necessary high doses of the 1st-generation sequestrants cholestyramine and colestipol are responsible for the major adverse side effects in the gastrointestinal tract with constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, and nausea being the cause for the compliance issues and high rate of treatment discontinuation up to 40-60% with first-generation sequestrants (Andrade et al. 1995) ; colesevelam due to its improved binding characteristics has only few adverse side effects and a high compliance of 88-93% (Davidson et al. 1999) . Because of the binding characteristics for anionic and hydrophobic compounds, chronic use of sequestrants may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients and interfere with the intestinal absorption of drugs and influencing their pharmacodynamics, particularly important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window such as anticoagulants, digitalis, \u03b2-blockers, thiazides, or thyroxine. In these cases, a time lack between intake of the respective drug and the sequestrant is recommended. By monotherapy, sequestrants can decrease LDL-C levels by 9-28% and increase HDL-C levels up to 9% (Hou and Goldberg 2009 ). First-generation sequestrants may lead to an undesired increase of plasma triglyceride levels which is not or significantly less the case with colesevelam. By the change in the composition of the bile acid pool with an enrichment of trihydoxy bile acids due to a higher binding affinity of dihydroxy bile acids to cholestyramine and colestipol, the less potent trihydroxy bile acids as FXR agonists lead to a decreased FXR activity such as a decrease in the expression of ApoC-II as an activator of lipoprotein lipase or reduction of the FXR-mediated inhibition of hepatic TG synthesis via Shp and Srebp1c (Kast et al. 2001) . As a result, the increased TG synthesis and the decreased TG clearance in the vasculature induces an overall increase of circulating TG.

Ezetimibe targets the NPC1L1 pathway which is a key regulator of cholesterol uptake from enterocyte brush border membranes and reuptake of cholesterol from bile into hepatocytes. Cholesterol solubilized in mixed micelles is transferred to the enterocyte brush border membrane via a protein-mediated process (Cai et al. 2002; Kramer et al. 2005 ) and moved to detergent-resistant microdomains from which cholesterol absorption occurs then by clathrin-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis involving a complex of clathrin, adaptor protein 2 complex, and NPC1L1 (Wang and Song 2012) with storage in the so-called endocytic recycling compartment. NPC1L1 is a cholesterol-sensing protein cycling between this compartment and the brush border membrane dependent on the cholesterol levels sensed in the brush border membrane; when intracellular cholesterol levels are low, NPC1L1 is with the aid of microfilaments recycled to the brush border membrane, thereby initiating and stimulating the microdomain endocytotic process. Ezetimibe specifically inhibits this NPC1L1 pathway. There is a controversy with regard to the primary molecular target of ezetimibe. It is postulated that the molecular target of ezetimibe is the NPC1L1 protein itself (Betters and Yu 2010) . However, a direct binding of ezetimibe to NPC1L1 by labeling techniques was never really demonstrated. By use of a fluorescent ezetimibe glucuronide, a specific binding to the surface of HEK 293 cells expressing NPC1L1 was shown (Garcia-Calvo et al. 2005) , but this can as well be explained by a role of NPC1L1 in forming of the protein complex necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Wang and Song 2012) , thereby allowing access of ezetimibe to its primary molecular target putatively being different from NPC1L1. In contrast, a direct and specific binding of ezetimibe to aminopeptidase N (CD13) was demonstrated by extensive photoaffinity labeling studies with various photoreactive ezetimibe analogues as well as by isolation of the ezetimibe-binding protein by affinity chromatography with an ezetimibe affinity matrix. Sequence analysis of the purified radiolabeled ezetimibe-binding protein or the affinity-purified ezetimibe-binding protein unequivocally demonstrated its identity with aminopeptidase N (CD13), whereas no amino acid sequences of NPC1L1 were found in the isolated ezetimibe-binding proteins (Kramer et al. 2004 (Kramer et al. , 2005 Frick et al. 2003) , indicating that aminopeptidase N is the primary target for ezetimibe in the process of NPC1L1-mediated endocytosis of cholesterol from cholesterol-rich microdomains of the enterocyte brush border membrane (Skov et al. 2010 ):", "cite_spans": [{"start": 398, "end": 415, "text": "(Cai et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 416, "end": 434, "text": "Kramer et al. 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 652, "end": 672, "text": "(Wang and Song 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1351, "text": "(Betters and Yu 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1609, "text": "(Garcia-Calvo et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1764, "text": "(Wang and Song 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF235"}, {"start": 2476, "end": 2495, "text": "(Kramer et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2496, "end": 2517, "text": "(Kramer et al. , 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2536, "text": "Frick et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2744, "end": 2761, "text": "(Skov et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ezetimibe"}, {"text": "a.

Ezetimibe does not influence intestinal absorption of bile acids, fat-soluble vitamins, or carotenes. Ezetimibe does not show any significant adverse side effects and has no influence on the activities of cytochrome P-450 enzymes, therefore being devoid of significant pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs. The effect of ezetimibe on LDL-C is additive to statins; therefore, combination of ezetimibe with a statin can overcome the \"rule of 6%\" by doubling of a statin dose.

Endogenous ligands comprise fatty acids and eicosanoids including leukotriene B4. Binding of an agonist to PPAR\u03b1 to the ligand-binding domain induces a conformational change, leading to the sequestration of a number of co-activator and corepressor proteins activating the receptor and heterodimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR) followed by binding to PPAR responsive elements (PPREs) in the promoters of the target genes initiating modification of their expression.

The interest in DGAT inhibitors was stimulated by the phenotype observed in DGAT k.o. mice. DGAT-1 k.o. mice have reduced TG levels, are resistant to diet-induced obesity, and show an increased insulin sensitivity (Smith et al. 2000; Chen and Farese 2000; Chen et al. 2002) . DGAT-2 k.o. mice show a similar phenotype but exert severe skin abnormalities questioning the usefulness as a potential therapeutic target.

For these patients, the reduction in the synthesis rate of LDL particles by inhibition of VLDL/chylomicron assembly would be a new therapeutic option.

Elevated LpPLA2 levels are linked to an increased CVD risk (Packard 2009 ). PLA2 hydrolyzes glycophospholipids at the surface of VLDL and LDL particles, yielding lysophosphatides, oxidized unesterified free fatty acids, and eicosanoids, the latter being further processed to proinflammatory mediators like prostanoids, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Additionally, the resulting VLDL and LDL particles are less efficiently cleared by the ApoB and ApoE receptors in the liver leading to an increased LDL-C level. These PLA2modified LDL particles are avidly bound to macrophages with subsequent receptormediated internalization of cholesterol fostering foam cell formation. Due to these, functions of PLA2 in atherogenesis inhibitors to both forms of PLA2 have been in clinical development for a long time. Darapladib was tested overall in more than 23,000 patients whether it could significantly reduce the rate of strokes and heart attacks.

Consequently, a liver-selective thyromimetic compound shows principally all desired actions for the treatment of dyslipidemias: decreases in LDL-C and TG and stimulation of RCT. Thyroid hormones exert these pleiotropic activities by means of thyroid receptors. The cholesterol-lowering activity is mainly mediated by the TR\u03b2-1 receptor isoform predominantly expressed in hepatocytes, whereas the TR\u03b1-1 receptor is responsible for the heart rate increasing effects; therefore, a high selectivity for the TR\u03b2-1 receptor is mandatory to avoid any CV adverse side effects (Gullberg et al. 2002) . After initial trials with naturally occurring thyroid hormones, the observed spectrum of beneficial effects for dyslipidemias stimulated the search for safe and liver-selective thyromimetics. Eprotirome (KB-2115) was investigated in phase III trials for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia. A 12-week study in 189 patients on statin therapy with 25-100 \u03bcg eprotirome/day showed promising results with reductions of LDL-C, TG, and Lp (a) of 22-32%, 27-43%, and 16-33%, respectively, with a small decrease in HDL-C by 6%. No significant adverse side effects on heart and cardiovascular function were observed (Ladenson et al. 2010 ). The development of the compound was terminated due to safety concerns by reason of cartilage damage after a 12-month toxicology study in dogs (Press Release Karo 2012). Another thyroid hormone receptor agonist, soberitome, was investigated in a phase I clinical trial, showing LDL-C reductions up to 41% in healthy volunteers (Scanlan 2010) , but the compound is also no longer in development. The continuing interest in thyroid hormone analogues to overcome the mechanism-based issues is documented by the recent entry of two new thyromimetic compounds -MGL-3196/VIA-3196 and ZYT1 -into phase I clinical trials. MGL-3196 is a liver-directed \u03b2-selective TR agonist lacking activity on the \u03b1-TR receptor without any observed cardiovascular activity. In a phase I clinical trial in 48 healthy volunteers receiving daily doses of 50-200 mg MGL-3196 for 2 weeks, the compound was found to be safe without significant adverse side effects: Plasma lipid profiles were beneficially influenced with decreases of 30% in LDL-C, 28% in non-HDL-C, 24% in ApoB, and 60% in TG, indicating a promising profile for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemias (Taub et al. 2013 ). The major challenge for thyromimetics for the treatment of dyslipidemias remains the unequivocal demonstration of their long-term safety.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 967, "end": 989, "text": "(Gullberg et al. 2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1639, "text": "(Ladenson et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1983, "text": "(Scanlan 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 2779, "end": 2796, "text": "(Taub et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Thyromimetics"}, {"text": "The clinical efficacy of statins is limited by the so-called rule of 6%: each time the dose of a statin is doubled, the resulting decrease in LDL-C lowering is only additional 6%. Elevations of plasma transaminase levels and muscle toxicity have been associated with high statin doses, thereby limiting the tolerated dose of a statin and the achievable reduction in plasma LDL-C levels. As a consequence, a significant percentage of statin-treated patients does not reach the recommended LDL-C target levels. The findings that around 3% of Afro-Americans are heterozygous for loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 associated with very low plasma LDL cholesterol levels and a reduction of CV events by 80-90% (Konrad et al. 2011 ) has made PCSK9 one of the most intensively investigated novel targets to treat hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a serine protease synthesized by the liver and the intestine as a 692 amino acid precursor protein. After autocatalytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum, the cleaved prodomain acts as a chaperone tightly bound to the mature 62 kDa PCSK9 protein permitting the entry of this complex into the secretory pathway (Lambert et al. 2012 ). The action of PCSK9 is twofold: (a) in the post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment, PCSK9 guides the LDL receptor for degradation into lysosomes and (b) mature 62 kDa PCSK9-protein is secreted and binds to the LDL receptor at the surface of the hepatocyte. The complex composed of PCSK9, LDL receptor, and the adaptor protein ARH is then internalized into endosomes. Binding of PCSK9 prevents the LDL receptor from being recycled back to the cell surface, shifting the PCSK9/LDL-receptor complex to the acidic compartment of lysosomes for degradation. By this dual action, PCSK9 reduces the surface expression of LDL receptors and thus decreases the clearance rate of LDL particles resulting in an increase of LDL-C plasma levels. The height of circulating PCSK9 levels is predictive for cardiovascular events in patients with CAD based on its positive correlation to plasma TG levels (Werner et al. 2014) , and thus plasma PCSK9 levels may be useful as a biomarker for CVD risk assessment. It is obvious from these mechanisms that by inhibition of the action of PCSK9, the endogenous \"brake\" in LDL-receptor-mediated LDL clearance can be released. The activity of PCSK9 is not restricted to the LDL receptor but also to a variety of other receptors like VLDLR, ApoER2 (LRP8), LRP1, BACE1, and hepatic receptor CD81 (Norata et al. 2014) ; the degradation of these receptors probably involves specific cellular pathways not directly linked with cholesterol metabolism, such as modulation of genes involved in proliferative, apoptotic, and inflammatory pathways (Norata et al. 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 706, "end": 725, "text": "(Konrad et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1172, "text": "(Lambert et al. 2012", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2080, "text": "(Werner et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF238"}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2511, "text": "(Norata et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 2735, "end": 2755, "text": "(Norata et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inhibitors of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9)"}, {"text": "Various observations contribute in a convergent manner to the high attractivity of PCSK9 as a (the ?) major regulator to treat hypercholesterolemia:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Inhibitors of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9)"}, {"text": "-Natural loss-of-function mutations in human lead to maximal reduction in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels without apparent adverse side effects.

For the three most advance antibodies -evolocumab (AMG-145), alirocumab (SAR236553/REGN727), and aococizumab (RIN 316)extensive data from clinical studies in phase I and II (all 3) as well as III for evolocumab and alirocumab have been published (an excellent overview about all performed and running clinical data can be found in the paper of Dadu et al.

Both monoclonal antibodies and PCSK9 mimetics tackle the function of the secreted PCSK9 protein only. Since PSCK9 is also intracellularly involved in the regulation of LDL-receptor surface expression approaches, silencing the PCSK9 gene should theoretically be even more effective. Both an antisense (BMS-PCSK9Rx-2) and gene-silencing approaches are evaluated. Most advanced in this regard is the investigational drug CAT-2003 in phase 2 clinical trials: CAT-2003 is an orally active small molecule -a covalent conjugate between niacin and eicosapentaenoic acid. The molecule is systemically inert, after uptake into cells the prodrug is intracellularly hydrolyzed into its pharmacologically active drugs. The molecular mechanism whereby CAT-2003 inhibits PCSK9 is the inhibition of the processing of the SREBP 120 kDa precursor protein into active SREBPs, thereby inhibiting the activation of SREBP-regulated target genes such as PCSK9 (Zimmer et al. 2014) . In HepG2 cells, expression of SREBP2 is reduced by 50% as well as PCSK9-mRNA. Due to the pleiotropic action of SREBPs, the actions of other genes like HMG-CoA-reductase, SCD-1, ACC-2, S1P, or S2P are as well inhibited. In ApoA3 Leiden mice being treated for 16 weeks with the compound plasma levels of PCSK9, total cholesterol and TG were reduced by 61%, 41%, and 33%, respectively; histological evaluation of the livers showed an increase in the expression of LDL receptor by 104%.

Lp(a) mediates its atherogenicity through both its LDL and its apolipoprotein (a) moiety, the latter being atherogenic because of the proinflammatory properties of the Kringle domains.

Principally, antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) or RNA silencing technologies are ideally suited to achieve a high specificity in inhibiting the specific function of a particular protein by downregulating its synthesis on the translation level, thereby minimizing the risk of drug-drug interactions due to lack of involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes in drug metabolism. This is of particular importance for multimorbid patients often receiving a multidrug therapy. Major disadvantages of antisense-directed therapies are their limited stability against serum and cellular nucleases, their limited permeability across biological membranes, as well as their off-target effects by interacting with Toll-like receptors (Jones 2011) . Therefore, RNA-based and antisense drugs have to be applied parenterally, and thus the delivery to their target tissues and cells is still a major challenge and obstacle for RNA and ASO drugs. After an i.v. injection, the majority of ASOs are accumulated in the liver and the kidney, thus making therapeutically interesting drug targets localized in these organs a priority for ASO therapy. On the other hand, this organotropism remains a major challenge for RNA and DNA-based drugs acting in other tissues than the liver and the kidney. Fortunately, the liver is the major organ regulating lipid homeostasis and metabolism, and therefore ASO therapies are a reliable approach to treat dyslipidemias by blocking the expression of target genes localized in the hepatocyte such as apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein(a), PCSK9, or MTP.

In addition to this key function, HDL particles exert antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic activities (Grunfeld and Feingold 2008) as well as improvement of endothelial function (Terasaka et al. 2008 ). The functionality of HDL particles is as important as the magnitude of plasma HDL levels for protection from atherosclerosis. HDL is also able to inhibit the formation of oxidized LDL, and lipid peroxides from oxidized LDL particles (oxLDL) can be transferred via CETP to HDL particles leading to a rapid clearance of the resulting lipid peroxide-laden HDL particles from circulation, indicating a role of HDL in the elimination of oxidized LDL as well (Garner et al. 1998) . Additionally, HDL and ApoA-1 can protect endothelial cells from injury by inhibiting signaling pathways involved in apoptosis of endothelial cells triggered by oxLDL or proinflammatory cytokines (Suc et al. 1997 ). The findings that people with certain ApoA-1 mutations are not at a higher risk for CVD despite very low overall HDL levels underline the essential role of HDL particle functionality.

The reverse translocation of TG from VLDL and LDL to HDL yields TG-rich HDL particles which are more prone to hydrolysis of their lipids by hepatic lipase. By this mechanism, the HDL particle is destabilized and more rapidly cleared by the kidney, resulting finally in decreased HDL plasma levels. Consequently, a high CETP activity leads to decreased plasma HDL levels. Therefore, a shift in partitioning of cholesterol between LDL/VLDL and HDL particles by blocking of CETP is one option to increase plasma HDL levels. The finding that certain individuals with loss-offunction mutations in the CETP gene showed elevated HDL levels and a decreased incidence of CHD (Koizumi et al. 1985; Inazu et al. 1990 ) triggered the search for CETP inhibitors. Other findings, however, showed that certain mutations in the CETP gene are associated with an increased risk of CHD despite high HDL-C levels (Zhong et al. 1996) . Additionally, animal experiments also show conflicting results with regard to beneficial and detrimental effects of CETP inhibition. Torcetrapib was the first CETP inhibitor being evaluated in human clinical trials. Monotherapy with a dose of 60 mg/day was able to increase HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 levels by 33%, 74%, and 26%, respectively, with a reduction of LDL-C by 8% (McKenney et al. 2006) . A large clinical trial with 60 mg/day torcetrapib on top of 10-80 mg/day atorvastatin showed an increase of HDL-C levels by 51.9% with an additional lowering of LDL-C of 20.6% compared to atorvastatin alone (Kastelein et al. 2007 ). In these and further studies, however, no effect of torcetrapib on progression or regression of atherosclerosis could be demonstrated despite a 60% increase in HDL-C levels. Torcetrapib increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 1.3-2.2 and 0.9-1.1 mmHg and was associated with an increase in the number of deaths from both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes in the torcetrapib-atorvastatin group compared to the atorvastatin group alone Davidson et al. 2006) , finally leading to the termination of its clinical development. Another CETP inhibitor, dalcetrapib, weaker in its pharmacological efficacy compared to torcetrapib, showed HDL-C increases by 25-30% without any effects on blood pressure. Later on it could be demonstrated that the hypertensive activity of torcetrapib is independent on its mechanism on CETP and is an off-target effect possibly by induction of elevated aldosterone and cortisol levels (Forrest et al. 2008) . Dalcetrapib was investigated in a phase III clinical trial with 15,000 patients for its ability to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome event (Schwartz et al. 2009 ). After an interim analysis, the development of the drug was discontinued not because of adverse side effects but due to disappointing results in the efficacy outcome not disclosed further yet. Despite these failures, the search for efficacious and safe CETP inhibitors is still one of the most active drug discovery fields for novel anti-atherosclerotic drugs. At least four small molecule CETP inhibitors are currently in clinical investigation. Anacetrapib now in phase III showed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 18-month trial at a dose of 100 mg/ day on top of a statin an increase of HDL-C by 138% and a decrease in LDL-C of 40% without any effect on blood pressure, serum electrolytes, or aldosterone levels without any cardiac adverse effects. Additionally, Lp(a) levels were decreased by 36.4% (Cannon et al. 2010) . In a direct comparative trial, 300 mg/day anacetrapib could increase HDL-C by 100% compared to 30% with 2 g/day nicotinic acid (Yvan-Charret et al. 2010) , the most potent HDL-C increasing drug available today. A huge trial involving 30,000 patients (REVEAL, NCT01252953) is under way to elucidate whether anacetrapib can reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in patients with optimized statin therapy. Evacetrapib in monotherapy increased HDL-C by 53.6-128.8% concomitantly with a decrease of LDL-C by 13.6-35.9% at doses of 30-500 mg/day. In combination with a statin a dose of 100 mg/day, evacetrapib increased HDL-C by 78.5-88.5% with an additional decrease of LDL-C of 11.2-13.9% (Nicholls et al. 2011a) . These clinical trials with anacetrapib and evacetrapib demonstrate a clear beneficial change of the lipid profiles.

A small clinical trial with an i.v. application of ApoA-1 Milano reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles was reported to induce a significant reduction of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with ACS after only 6 weeks of treatment with a decrease of atheroma volume by 14.1% (Nissen et al. 2003) . This surprising result triggered the research for efficient HDL replacement therapies. The ApoA-1 Milano phospholipid formulation MDCO-216 was investigated in a phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of atherothrombotic diseases and ACS as well as for prevention of restenosis after CABG and balloon angioplasty. 3 Twenty-four healthy individuals and 24 patients with confirmed CAD received a 2-h infusion of MDCO-216 in doses of 5-40 mg/kg and followed for 30 days. Half-lifetime ranged from 45 to 59 h. In both groups ApoA-1, phospholipids and prebeta HDL levels were increased with an increase in HDL particle size accompanied by decreases in ApoE; in dosages above 20 mg/kg, however, increases in TG and decreases in HDL-C were observed (Bellibas et al. 2014) . Overall the drug was well tolerated with no serious adverse events or safety issues. CSL-111 is a synthetic HDL particle reconstituted from ApoA-1 isolated from human plasma with soybean phosphatidylcholine. The compound failed in phase II trials to reduce plaque volume in coronary arteries in patients suffering from a recent episode of ACS (Tardif et al. 2007 ). In patients with ACS receiving a single infusion of 80 mg/kg CS-111 over 4 h, no significant difference could be detected in the surrogate markers of forearm venous occlusion plethysmography despite a 64% increase in HDL-C and a 23% decrease in LDL-C (Chenevard et al. 2012) . A reformulation of CSL-111named CSL-112 -is currently in phase II clinical trials in stable CAD patients (Gille et al. 2012; Diditchenko et al. 2012) . In 57 healthy volunteers, having received a single dose of 5-135 mg/kg CSL-112 increased prebeta 1-HDL by 3,600% and stimulated macrophage cholesterol efflux mediated by ABCA1 by 630% and increased efflux capacity by 192% . Mechanistic investigations suggest that the infused CSL-112 particles fuse with HDL in plasma with subsequent release of lipid-poor ApoA-1 (Diditchenko et al. 2014 ). The effects lasted at least for 72 h indicating that a once or twice weekly infusion could be an appropriate treatment regimen (Gille et al. 2012) . Additionally, CSL-112 exerted anti-inflammatory effects with a strong inhibition in the expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (CD-54) on monocytes and neutrophils and a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, Il-1\u03b2, Il-6) and chemokines (Il-8, RANTES, Mip-1\u03b2) (Diditchenko et al. 2012) . CER-001 is an HDL-mimetic, comprise of recombinant ApoA-I complexed with phospholipids and designed to mimic the beneficial properties of natural nascent pre-\u03b2 HDL particles. In healthy volunteers, CER-001 increased plasma ApoA-1 levels after a single infusion in a dosedependent manner with similar increases in HDL-C (Keyserling et al. 2011 ). In rabbits CER-001 was at least 10-20 times more potent than ETC-216 to mobilize cholesterol from macrophages (Kastelein 2015) . In a placebo-controlled phase 2b study (CHI-SQUARE) with 507 patients with ACS given CER-001 for 6 weeks with weekly infusions, the drug failed to show that this HDL mimetic can reduce total atheroma volume; intravenous ultrasound analysis (IVUS) scans conducted 3 weeks after the last infusion showed that CER-01 reduced total atheroma volume from baseline, but the change was not significantly different from the change from baseline seen in the placebo group (Press Release Cerenis 2014a; Tardif et al. 2014) . In a further clinical trial in patients with familial primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia, however, CER-001 was able to reduce carotid artery mean vessel wall area as measured by magnetic resonance imaging after treatment of 23 patients with 9 doses of CER-001 over 4 weeks.

RVX-208 is an inhibitor of BET proteins (bromodomain and extracellular domain) including BRD4, a member of the BET protein family (Belkina and Denis 2012) . One of the key epigenetic mechanisms involves the modification of chromosomal proteins by acetylation, methylation, or phosphorylation catalyzed by specific enzymes. The modified amino acids of histones serve as baits for other proteins including BET proteins for binding and reading this epigenetic code. BET proteins contain two specific sites -the bromodomain and extracellular domain -which can recognize acylated lysine residues of histones bound to DNA. By binding of BET proteins to these modified histones, additional cofactors regulating gene activity are recruited leading to an increase in gene transcription as the ApoA-1 apolipoprotein. RVX-208 mimics the binding of acylated lysine residues to BET, thereby triggering the cascade of increased ApoA-1 gene transcription and ApoA-1 formation. A phase IIb clinical trial (SUSTAIN) with 176 patients with established atherosclerosis RVX-208 significantly raised HDL-C with increases in ApoA-1 levels and large HDL particles, thereby stimulating RCT (Nicholls et al. 2011b) . Statin-treated patients with CHD being treated with 50-150 mg/day RVX-208 for 12 weeks showed an increase of 0.1-5.6% for ApoA-I, 3.2-8.3% in HDL-C, and 11.1-21.1% in the number of large HDL particles (Nicholls et al. 2011b) . In 10% of patients, transient and significant increases in liver transaminases were observed. In a phase 2b placebo-controlled clinical trial, 323 patients with low HDL levels and established CHD were randomized to a placebo group (n \u00bc 80) or a treatment group (n \u00bc 243). All patients received either 10-40 mg/day atorvastatin or 5-20 mg/day rosuvastatin, whereas the treatment group received 100 mg bid RVX-208 for 6 months. RVX-208 failed in achieving its primary and secondary endpoints to increase HDL-C and ApoA-I or to reduce arterial plaques (European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2013). HDL-C and ApoA-I were increased by 10.9 and 12.8% vs 7.7 and 10.6% in the placebo group. No differences were found for LDL-C (\u00c016 vs \u00c017.6), large HDL particles (38.1 vs 38), or hsCRP (\u00c032.7% vs \u00c033.8%), whereas liver transaminase increases were more often reported in the RVX-208 group (7% vs 0%). In the primary endpoint, the medium change percent of atheroma volume, the RVX-208 group showed a change of \u00c00.4% vs \u00c00.3% in the placebo group. The reasons for failure are not yet clear: lack of efficacy, a too short duration of treatment, or the inability to improve to beneficial effects of statin treatment. Due to their crucial role in cell gene control, BET inhibitors may depress transcription of endogenous human retroviruses because the BET protein-containing transcription regulator complexes can also exert corepressor function (Belkina and Denis 2012) . Since the efficacy data of RVX-208 on HDL-C are so far disappointing, further studies will be necessary to determine the validity of this epigenetic approach to increase HDL levels.

Therefore, increasing of LCAT activity by stimulation, increase of expression, or exogenous delivery could be a way to increase functional plasma HDL levels and stimulate RCT. A proof of concept was recently demonstrated in one patient with the rare genetic disease familial LCAT deficiency (125 patients so far reported). Patients with LCAT deficiency have dramatically low levels of HDL-C with a pathophysiological phenotype including corneal opacities (\"fish-eye disease\"), anemia, splenomegaly, and severe kidney disease, the latter being the major cause of morbidity and mortality.
