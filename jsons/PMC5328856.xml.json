Results of research testing were not shared with the clinical team. Samples through 4 months after discharge are included in this report. In addition, families were reminded at each visit to notify the study team if a child developed respiratory symptoms that reached a score of \u22653 on the Childhood Origins of ASThma or \u201cCOAST\u201d score.8, 9, 10 When a respiratory illness was identified, a study visit was completed as soon as possible.

Visitor restrictions were in place from mid-December to mid-March limiting visitors to 4 for each infant with no visitors permitted under the age of 14 years. Influenza vaccination or surgical mask use was required of staff each winter and strongly encouraged for family members. Sibling visits were allowed outside the winter months but required review by a NICU nurse to obtain an updated immunization history and review of symptoms. At all times, visitors were asked to refrain from entering the NICU if they had symptoms of a respiratory illness.",

Survival analysis was applied to study the infection-free curves of preterm babies during NICU hospitalization vs term babies in the community, and of both cohorts in the community, controlling for other covariates. For the NICU vs community comparison, time to first infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection for preterm babies and discharge date and infection date for term babies. For the comparison of both cohorts in the community, time to first infection was the interval between discharge date and infection date. Time to repeat infection was the interval between previous and current infection dates. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier nonparametric estimation of infection-free probability curves were used to compare days with infection between groups (eg, cohort [preterm vs term], sex [female vs male], and others). Further, the intensity model29 using the model-based covariance estimate and coupled with stepwise variable selection was used to explore the effect of demographics and to account for within-subject correlation. All statistical analyses were conducted using v 9.4 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).",

The first infant had symptoms including sneezing, progressive congestion, and cough, and the clinical team suspected a viral respiratory infection. RSV was identified in the clinical laboratory and by weekly study sampling obtained the following day. The second infant had tachypnea and tachycardia and the following day had an elevated temperature to 38.1\u00b0C. Coronavirus 4 was identified by the clinical laboratory and in the study sample the following day. The third infant underwent a sepsis evaluation for bacterial infection 9 days before hRV was identified in a study sample. Worsening respiratory function prompted the sepsis investigation that included a tracheal aspirate for bacterial culture and Mycoplasma culture but no viral diagnostic studies were performed and the symptoms were attributed to evolving BPD when all routine cultures were negative. A weekly study specimen obtained 4 days before the sepsis evaluation was negative for respiratory pathogens. At the time of hRV identification, no specific symptoms were noted in the infant. The fourth infant had influenza B identified in a weekly sample, had not undergone a sepsis evaluation in the prior 3 months, and was clinically asymptomatic. Thus, only 2 of 71 (2.8%) sepsis evaluations identified a viral respiratory infection, and both infants had symptoms suggestive of the diagnosis.",

Seventy-one percent of term babies were infected within 4 months with 27% acquiring a viral respiratory infection in the first 2 months of life. Preterm infants had a slightly higher rate of infection, with 37% acquiring at least 1 infection in the 2 months after discharge. However, the difference in the likelihood of acquiring at least 1 respiratory viral infection in the first 4 months between the 2 groups while living in the community was not significant (P = .39). Further, the log-rank test suggested no difference in the infection-free probability curves between the 2 groups after hospital discharge (Figure 2, B). The immediate respiratory viral infection rate after hospital discharge was not associated with mode of delivery, multiple birth, or sex by the marginal analyses. Although hRV was the predominant virus detected in both groups, 12 different viral species were identified in infants in the community (Table V; available at www.jpeds.com).",

We obtained nose and throat samples from our population once weekly while in the NICU; this may have led to a decreased detection rate. Previous studies have shown that respiratory samples obtained from the nasal turbinates with a flocked swab have similar sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates and that adding a throat swab to a nasal swab improves the detection of respiratory viruses.33, 34 In addition, viral identification by polymerase chain reaction is highly sensitive, and the TAC platform has been shown to have at least equivalent detection of viral nucleic acid as other commercially available detection systems.16 Prior studies also have identified extended periods of shedding of respiratory viruses (\u22657 days), especially in younger age cohorts, suggesting that our sampling should have been sufficient to identify infections in our NICU population.5, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Our pre- and postdischarge TAC platform and sampling techniques were identical and readily detected viral infections in both term and preterm infants after discharge, supporting the study design. A further limitation is that we did not obtain respiratory samples specifically at the time of suspected sepsis while the preterm infants were in the NICU, and our sampling schedule differed between hospitalized infants and those living in the community. Nevertheless, our data suggest that weekly sampling was sufficient to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in hospitalized preterm infants. Once living in the community, the monthly sampling schedule likely missed asymptomatic infections in both preterm and term infants. However, as the schedule was the same between these 2 groups and we were comparing the infection rates between them, we do not believe this limitation substantially changes our results.",
