Rather, another explanation for the differentials lies in the distribution of income or the income gradient between the low and high socioeconomic groups. In a study of white Americans using 1980 census data, undertaken by Smith et al. ( 1996 , p. 486) , men earning less than $10,000 per year were 1.5 times as likely to die prematurely as were those earning $34,000 or more. A similar study of British civil servants conducted about 2 years before the American study showed that when smoking and other risk factors were controlled for, those who were in the lowest employment category were more than twice as likely to die prematurely of cardiovascular disease as were those in the highest employment category (Davey Smith et al. 1994 , p. 131) . The fi ndings of these studies have led to the theory that inequitable distribution of income and wealth, or the socalled income and wealth gradient, causes poor health (Sen 1992 (Sen , p. 102, 1999 Daniels et al. 2000 ; Deaton 2002 , p. 13 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 358, "end": 387, "text": "Smith et al.
