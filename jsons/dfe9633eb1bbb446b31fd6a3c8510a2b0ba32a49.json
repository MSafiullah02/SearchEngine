            "text": "The surge of patients in the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may overwhelm the medical systems of many countries. Mask-wearing and handwashing can slow the spread of the virus, but currently, masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely handwashing is often impossible. In this study, the efficacy of three types of masks and instant hand wiping was evaluated using the avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus. Virus quantification was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Previous studies on mask-wearing were reviewed. The results showed that instant hand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the virus from hands, respectively. N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of four-layer kitchen paper and one-layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols. Medical maskwearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment. With these data, we propose the approach of mask-wearing plus instant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus. This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID-19. Collectively, a simple approach to slow the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 was proposed with the support of experiments, literature review, and control experiences.",

In this sense, it is important to have one item at hand, such as 75% alcohol, hand sanitizer gel, disinfecting wipes, for instant hand hygiene after we have touched something possibly contaminated by the virus. This is more important for those traveling long-distance using public vehicles or having touched some items frequently touched by other people. This study suggested that instant hand wiping using a wet towel containing soap or sodium hypochlorite removed most viruses from hands. Water containing 1.00% soap powder is not only helpful for wiping away the virus using its surfactant activity but also efficiently inactivates enveloped viruses including coronavirus, as proved by multiple previous studies. [17] [18] [19] Moreover, water containing 1.00% soap powder is safe for skin and other items including clothes. It is worth noting that the concentration of soap powder and sodium hypochlorite is vital for their wiping and virucidal effects.",

            "text": "Various studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through droplets and aerosols, 1-7 and so hand hygiene is inadequate to prevent infection of SARS-CoV-2, and blocking masks are needed. This study showed that N95 masks blocked nearly all the mock virus, and medical masks blocked approximately 97% of the virus, and the homemade mask blocked approximately 95% of the virus. Therefore, the medical masks are not fully protective in hospitals but are useful for common social occasions. When medical masks are in shortage, the homemade masks made of four-layer kitchen paper (each layer contains three thin layers) and one layer of polyester cloth should be helpful, as indicated by this study. The kitchen paper is effective in blocking the virus possibly because of its multiple layers, nonwoven structure, and virus-absorbing property. As we have tested by ourselves, the tested homemade masks are more breathable than the N95 masks. One advantage of the homemade mask is that the kitchen paper can be changed frequently. It is worth noting that the homemade masks shall be of less blocking efficacy if made of fewer layers of kitchen paper. Other types of homemade masks, especially those made of cloth alone, may be unable to block the virus and thus confer no protection against the virus. 20,21 Additionally, although a person inhales much more than 100 times a day, the mocking data are reliable because aerosols containing the virus to be inhaled by a person on most common social occasions are fewer than in this experiment. Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not support the efficacy of medical masks because medical masks could not reduce infection rates of some viral respiratory diseases. 14, 15 Consequently, people in some countries opposed to using medical masks on common social occasions. In effect, the conclusions of these RCTs could be erroneous, as reflected by the following assumed scenario. Supposed the virus could have ten opportunities to infect a human during a period of 30 days, wearing medical masks could block three of the 10 opportunities and thus reduce the infection risk by 30%, although it itself could not block the other seven opportunities during the 30 days. Therefore, the fact that medical mask-wearing did not reduce the infection rate could suggest that medical mask-wearing is inadequate to prevent the infection, rather than useless for reducing the infection risk. Some other RCTs and many nonrandomized studies regarding the use of medical masks supported the notion that wearing medical masks could reduce infection risks of some viral respiratory diseases.
