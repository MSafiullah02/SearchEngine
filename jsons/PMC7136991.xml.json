This nosocomial outbreak was most intriguing, with 82 people (33 patients, eight health-care workers, and 41 visitors) being infected following exposure to Patient 14 on May 27\u201329 in the emergency room. Patients staying in the same zone as Patient 14 had the highest attack rate (20% [23 of 117 patients]), compared with 5% (three of 58) in those with brief exposure to Patient 14 at the registration area or the radiology suite of the emergency room, and 1% (four of 500) in other patients who stayed in different zones. The median incubation period of patients who stayed in the same zone as Patient 14 was shorter than that in patients who stayed in different zones (5 days [IQR 4\u20138] vs 11 days [6\u201312]; p<0\u00b70001). No cases were documented in patients and visitors who had visited the emergency room on May 29 and were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with Patient 14.5 The data suggest that the location (and hence the timing) of exposure to Patient 14 was an important factor in determining the attack rate and incubation period.",
