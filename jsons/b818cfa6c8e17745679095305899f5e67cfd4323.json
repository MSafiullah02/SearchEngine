Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis. The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact. The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.",

This is necessitated by optical imperatives to optimise image quality by close alignment of imaging devices to the eye. Slit lamp biomicroscopy is the cornerstone of ophthalmic practice and the slit lamp is also used to carry out surgical procedures. The back focal distance (the distance of the subject from the front lens surface of the microscope), is set to give the surgeon sufficient space for manipulation ~ 11 cm (Figure 2A ). With the instrument body length added, the distance from patient to the surgeon's eye is at a convenient working distance of ~ 28-30cm. This proximity and the possibility of cross infection between examiner and examinee has long been recognized and a protective, transparent, typically Perspex \u00ae \"breath shield\" was added to slit lamps. It is evident in slit lamps from as early as 1919 (13) and may well have gained popularity during the era of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The necessity for such shields is readily apparent from studies in which exposure between two face-to-face breathing manikins is measured This study concluded that air exhaled from human respiration contains contaminants and is able to penetrate the breathing zone of other nearby persons. Of interest is that exhalation flow may stratify in a horizontal layer at breathing zone height under certain conditions. Thus, with slit lamp examination, the layer of air between patient and ophthalmologist may remain stable, exposing both individuals for the entire time of the examination. Breath shields 6 are often missing from slit lamps either because they are not fitted or because, as they get in the way, are removed. nares: (a), average total eye surface exposed; shaded area represents proportion of time not exposed, due to winking; (b), average total mouth area exposed in talking; shaded area represents proportion of time not exposed, due to closure; (c), average total area of crosssection of nares exposed; shaded area represents proportion of time not exposed, owing to protected position and expiration (5) .",

In epidemic adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis ((AKC), shipyard/eye hospital eye) (10, 16) , ophthalmologists are not infrequently infected although this is not well documented (17, 18) . While AKC can cause considerable incapacity and has resulted in some riskminimization measures, unlike coronavirus it does not usually result in death. The earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic resulted in recommendations for how to manage eye facilities and include advice in relation to slit lamp cleaning and eye protection for staff (19, 20) . Slit lamp biomicroscopy is an almost optimal method of transferring material in breaths between two individuals, short of actual facial contact. A very recent study provides evidence for human-to-human transmission (21) . Pathways include direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission as well as contact transmission including contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes (22) . SARS-CoV-2 aerosol and fomite transmission is highly likely, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on different surfaces up to days (23) . While transmission of coronaviruses occurs via an airborne route (24), because infected, symptomatic patients tend to develop severe lower, as opposed to upper respiratory tract infections, it has been supposed that airborne agent virus has to be small enough to penetrate directly into the lower respiratory tract to preferentially replicate there before causing disease. That transmission could occur via the ocular-nasolacrimal pathway was not considered.",

            "text": "Maxcy's early study (5) was a good estimate (Table 1) of the \"visible\" ocular surface. The later study (26) also explains variability in measurements, since palpebral aperture is dependent on eye gaze direction. However, the total ocular surface area has been estimated at ~ 1600 -1869 sq. mm/eye (27, 28) , including the cornea, this representing a maximal absorptive area of ~ 3738 sq.mm, accounting for the tarsal conjunctiva and including the palpebral fornices. Even this consideration underestimates the potential ocular/periocular landing zone for a viral particle. It is not an uncommon observation that makeup, applied around the eye, can \"migrate\" onto the ocular surface (29) , similar to the phenomenon by which noxious agents in minute quantities are easily transferred from fingertip to periocular skin and then the eye. This may be due to subtle actions of Riolan's muscle (30) . In fact, this mechanism of transport of agents from the periocular eye lid skin to the eye (obviating the need for eyedrops) has been termed supracutaneous and has been developed as an efficient delivery system for management of dry eye syndrome (31) . This supracutaneous mechanism, might provide a substantial periocular area in which viral particles could land and be \"funnelled\" onto the ocular surface and beyond. Table 1 provides available information on the size of the orbital opening (32 and reviewed in 33), which likely underestimates the area of eyelid skin. We have estimated eyelid skin to be ~ 4000 mm 2 and that of the brow to be ~ 3000mm 2 , so that in total with the ocular surface area, a landing site of ~ 10,000mm 2 would be available, -2 orders of magnitude greater than for the nares and mouth. This does not take into account the surface area that could be attributed to the hair of the eyebrows or the eyelashes, for which estimates have not been made. Eyelash aerodynamics may also play a role (34) . Eyelashes have been shown to divert airflows, acting as a passive ocular dust controlling system. They reduce evaporation and particle deposition up to 50%. In a comparative study (35) , Asian eyelashes had lower lift-up and curl-up angles, fewer numbers and a thicker transverse diameter as compared to Caucasian eyelashes. Whether these differences play any role in influencing the rate at which particles land on the ocular surface is unknown. However, it is possible that a deficiency in this mechanism could increase the risk of infection.",

The eye and its adnexae were not investigated in this study. It was subsequently shown that ACE2 protein is more abundantly expressed on the apical than the basolateral surface of polarized airway epithelia (43) and thus accessible by topical agents. An immunohistochemical study revealed both extra-and intraocular localisation of ACE in human eyes (44) . Of particular interest was the localisation of ACE to the epithelial cells of both the cornea and conjunctiva. Apical epithelia location and whether receptors are ACE2 remains to be confirmed. Recently, more widespread distribution of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, ACE2 as well as TMPRSS2 protease and cathepsin B/L activity (for post-binding spike protein priming) have been documented using single-cell RNA-sequencing data (45) . While it was recognized that binding affinity of the spike protein and ACE2 is the major determinant of SARS-CoV replication rate and disease severity and that viral entry also depends on protease activity, ACE2, rather than protease activity, may be a limiting factor for initial viral entry. This study confirmed evidence of ACE2 in the limbus, corneal epithelium (basal/suprabasal, superficial and wing cells) and conjunctiva (basal and superficial cells) and co-location with TMPRSS2 in superficial conjunctival cells. Of interest is that this study demonstrated evidence of ACE2 in nasal goblet cells which also express genes associated with immune functions including innate and antiviral immune functions. There should be some priority for re-evaluation of these elements in the ocular surface (46) .",

This strategy has previously been employed, using antibodies (66) -anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibody blocked viral replication in a model system. Blocking of TMPRSS2 protease and cathepsin B/L activity could also be considered, however it appears that ACE2, rather than protease activity, may be the viral entry rate limiting factor (45) . A search of FDA-approved drug libraries identified a number of drugs including chloroquine as potentially having anti-coronavirus actions (71) and therefore potentially able to be repurposed. Table 2 summarises the drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for coronavirus infection, their efficacy (in vitro and in vivo) and for which there is data (for that agent or a related compound) for previous topical ocular surface usage. It is apparent that while for each of these agents, there is evidence of in vitro anti-coronavirus activity, there is a paucity of in vivo studies. This has been raised as a matter for concern in that there are precedents for paradoxical untoward drug systemic effects that result in increased disease severity when in vitro testing alone might suggest efficacy (85) .",

A number of predisposing factors to retinal toxicity include genetic (97) -polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 gene, drug interactions (98) and racial factors (99)), may play a role. Chloroquine's anticancer activity in concert with zinc have been explained by the fact that chloroquine acts as a zinc ionophore (100), significantly, inhibiting cellular autophagy and enhancing apoptotic cell death via inhibition of lysosome function. It transpires that zinc inhibits coronavirus polymerase activity (101), blocking viral replication.

This would potentially inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the likely major entry point into the human body, would reduce the risk of systemic side effects and conserve drugs that may become scarce, since the dosage required would be much less than for systemic treatment. A spray or aerosol preparation would also allow treatment of the nasal passages (45) and mouth (109), given high ACE2 receptor populations in these locations. However, if the virus is truly oculotropic, this may be superfluous. If a patient has active infection of the respiratory tree, then this combined medication could also be given in an inhaled form. The advantage of this ACE2 targeting approach is that ACE2 receptors from the outer cornea, through the lacrimal drainage system to the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems as well as both nasal and oral cavities, are directly accessible to a high topical drug dose. Thus, the portals that make us susceptible to coronavirus attack and invasion can be used to provide protection that is likely to be safe, extensive, convenient and at low cost. The ocular surface, offering all of the benefits of local treatment familiar to ophthalmologists, may thus provide a convenient testing ground for rapid, safe and likely cost-effective trials of newer drugs that may be developed to combat this modern plague.

In the skin, extracellular surface lipids provide a barrier function (51) and while a similar function might keep viruses from accessing ocular surface receptors, tear and supracutaneous flow could result in a \"second chance\" for the virus to bind to receptors downstream in the lacrimal drainage pathway and beyond. The tear film, comprised of nonpolar lipids, is generally hydrophobic (52). The coronaviruses with a crown of spike proteins around a lipid bilayer envelope (53) may be well suited to adhering to the ocular surface. Coronavirus cell entry and adhesion require lipid rafts and the presence of cell membrane cholesterol (54, 55) and in a sense, the cholesterol containing tear lipid layer (56) might act as \"lipid raft\", facilitating initial viral adhesion. The precise nature of potential viral adhesion to the tear film requires elucidation since this represents another potential means of intervention via local rather than systemic means. The possibility of ocular surface viral replication and transmission should be further explored given the finding of likely sustained SARS-CoV-2 replication in three patients with systemic infection and conjunctivitis",

ACE inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of systemic diseases including hypertension and are generally well tolerated (67). This class of drugs has not previously been considered as having an anti-viral role. Crystallography studies demonstrate that while the ACE inhibitor lisinopril binds in a region near the centre of the receptor (68,69), the virus binding sites are on the outer surface of the receptor near the N terminal (39), so direct blocking by lisinopril of the virus attachment site seems unlikely. However, the potent ACE2inhibitor MLN-4760 induces a large receptor conformational change, a hinge bending motion, important for both inhibitor binding and catalysis and could prove to be unfavourable for viral binding to the receptor and/or syncytial formation(69). It was thought that metallopeptidase inhibitors such as MLN-4760 may prove useful for prevention of viral binding to ACE2(70).",
