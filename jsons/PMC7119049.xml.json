The web-based application was implemented on a limited basis at some GTA hospitals on June 16. Although it will not replace the existing paper-based system, an estimated 70% to 80% of requests can be processed using the web-based application. This allows health care facilities with web access to receive transfer authorization in minutes. This system will improve throughput and decrease the number of staff required.",
