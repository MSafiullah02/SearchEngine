The current state of diagnosis has led to misdiagnosis early on in infection. Here we describe the use of a novel sample preparation technology, NanoTrap particles, to enhance the detection of RVFV. Previous studies demonstrated that NanoTrap particles lead to both 100 percent capture of protein analytes as well as an improvement of more than 100-fold in sensitivity compared to existing methods. Here we extend these findings by demonstrating the capture and enrichment of viruses.",

Importantly, NT53 capture of RVFV resulted in greater than 100-fold enrichment from low viral titers when other diagnostics assays may produce false negatives. NT53 was also capable of capturing and enhancing RVFV detection from serum samples. RVFV that was inactivated through either detergent or heat treatment was still found bound to NT53, indicating the ability to use NanoTrap particles for viral capture prior to transport to a BSL-2 environment. Furthermore, both NP-40-lysed virus and purified RVFV RNA were bound by NT53. Importantly, NT53 protected viral RNA from RNase A degradation, which was not observed with other commercially available beads. Incubation of RVFV samples with NT53 also resulted in increased viral stability as demonstrated through preservation of infectivity at elevated temperatures. Finally, NanoTrap particles were capable of capturing VEEV and HIV, demonstrating the broad applicability of NanoTrap particles for viral diagnostics.",

RVFV has remained endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, causing major outbreaks throughout the continent over the last century [6] . In 1976, 200,000 individuals were infected and 600 fatal cases were reported in Egypt [5] . Most likely due to international livestock trade, it has since crossed the Arabian Peninsula into Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Over 30 mosquito species, mostly Aedes and Culex are vectors for RVFV [5] . Of particular concern is that the Aedes species is widely distributed in the EU countries and many of those countries (Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and France) have high-risk vector habitat areas that may serve as emergent sites. Moreover, in the Unites States, this species has been found in 23 states [7] .

            "text": "NanoTrap particles are a novel technology that can address all the critical analytical challenges for pathogen identification and measurement. They are homogenous hydrogel particles of about 800 nanometers in size that have a shell made of polymers of Nisopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and co-monomers such as acrylic acid (AAc) and allylamine (AA) with cross links of N,N9methylenebisacrylamide (BIS). This shell can be modified to alter permeability or porosity by increasing or decreasing the percentage of BIS [9, 10] . Charge-based affinity baits are incorporated into the NanoTrap particles by copolymerization and covalent binding to the shell [10] . The NanoTrap particles are temperature-and pH-sensitive, decreasing in size with increased temperature and low pH. The molecular sieving properties of the particles depend on several aspects. The degree of cross-linking within the particles provides inclusion and exclusion of high abundance large molecules (e.g. albumin). Affinity baits further facilitate the capture and concentration of the target protein, and prevent it from exiting the particle. They may be of negative or positive charge, therefore attracting analytes of opposite charge. This was seen in an early experiment performed by Luchini et al. where the incubation of particles containing anionic affinity baits captured myoglobin, a protein with a positive charge [9] . Some NanoTrap particles are composed of NIPAm shells, and a few of these shelled NanoTrap particles are also coated with vinyl sulfonic acid (VSA) [11] . NanoTrap particles are able to perform three functions in one step: molecular size sieving, target analyte affinity sequestration, and complete protection of captured analytes from degradation. Furthermore, NanoTrap particles help to bridge the gap between detection and the limits of sensitivity. Mass spectrometry (specifically liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry) is a favored technique for the discovery of candidate biomarkers in biological fluids. However, this technique only accepts a small input volume and complex solutions often lead to decreased sensitivity. The NanoTrap particles concentrate protein analytes in small volumes to effectively amplify the sensitivity of mass spectrometry. In addition, their promiscuity allows for multiple analytes to be harvested from a single sample [9] . Experiments conducted by Luchini et al. demonstrated the capture and enrichment of small molecules spiked in complex solutions such as whole blood and serum [9, 10] . A 2011 study by Douglas et al. on the detection of Lyme disease demonstrated that NanoTrap particles can improve sensitivity more than 100-fold (over existing methods) as well as lead to 100 percent capture and 100 percent elution yield of low abundance antigens in biofluids. Lyme disease antigens at low abundance were detected in both urine samples as well as from a single infected tick [12] .",

We were not only able to capture and detect RVFV at very low titers from both media and serum, but we were also able to inactivate the virus, which allows for its safe transport to BSL-2 laboratories. While there are other commercially available beads that can also capture virus, NanoTrap particles are the only beads that can protect the viral RNA from enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that whole virus detection with NanoTrap particles is not limited to only RVFV, but that NanoTrap particles can be used to detect other viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV).",

It had previously been found that sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations between 0.5M and 2M could effectively elute various analytes from cibacron blue dyes by disrupting electrostatic interactions between cibacron blue dyes (the bait molecule found within NT53; [16] ). We hypothesized that incubating the RVFV-bound NanoTrap particles on ice would allow the particles to swell and, with the aid of vortexing, the virus would disassociate from the NanoTrap particles. Therefore, we tested a NaCl based elution method coupled with an ice-swelling method. Plaque assays were performed to determine the amount of virus eluted from the NanoTrap particles and the amount that remained bound to the particles after a high salt elution. After NT53 incubation with RVFV, the pellets were resuspended in 2.0 M NaCl in DMEM and placed on ice for 30 minutes with vortexing every ten minutes. Both the eluates and pellets were analyzed by plaque assay ( Figure S1 ). The results showed that 5.5% of RVFV was detected after elution with 2.0M NaCl. The addition of NaCl coupled with incubation on ice only slightly released RVFV virions, demonstrating the virus' strong affinity for the NanoTrap particles. However, as seen in Figure 1B , RVFV-bound NanoTrap pellets directly added to Vero cells during the plaque assays procedure were capable of producing plaques. Based on these results, we opted not to elute RVFV from the NanoTrap particles, but rather to add the RVFV bound to the NanoTrap particles directly during the plaque assay procedure.",

We specifically wanted to see the enrichment potential at lower viral titers when detection would be most difficult.

After NanoTrap particle incubation with RVFV and subsequent washes, NP-40 detergent was used to inactivate the virus (Figure 4 ). Plaque assays were performed to confirm viral inactivation. Plaque assays demonstrated that 0.1% NP-40 did not fully inactivate the virus incubated with or without NT53 ( Figure 4A ).

In the presence of NP-40 the levels of capture with NT53 were decreased as compared to the controls.

Therefore, we wanted to directly compare the ability of other beads to capture RVFV with NT53's RVFV capture capability. The capture of RVFV was tested with NT53 and six commercially available beads used in various assays. DEAE-Sephadex beads are used in ion exchange chromatography for purifying and isolating proteins; Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin are used for isolating nucleic acids and antibodies; Sephacryl S-200 beads are used to purify protein and macromolecules; Biorex 70 Resin beads are used for purification and fractionation of peptides, proteins, and other cationic molecules; SP Sephadex C-25 beads are used in chromatography to separate and purify protein, polypeptides, and other charged molecules; and Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapatite beads are used in chromatography to separate and purify proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, and other macromolecules. These calcium phosphate beads work by the cationic interaction of the Ca 2+ functional groups with the carboxylate residues located on the protein surface and the anionic interaction of the PO 4 22 functional groups with the basic protein residues. RVFV was incubated with each of these beads and plaque assays were performed to determine whole virus capture. Bio-gel HTP Hydroxyapatite (HTP) captured RVFV the most efficiently, averaging 1.0E+7 pfu/ml, while NT53 performed the second best averaging 2.5E+6 pfu/ml ( Figure 6A ). The other four beads captured RVFV around or below 1.0E+5 pfu/ml.",

For these experiments NT53 or HTP were added to the samples followed by viral inactivation through treatment with 1% NP-40 or heating at 57uC. The amount of virus captured was quantitated by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6C ). As was observed in previous experiments, viral inactivation with either NP-40 or heat treatment resulted in some loss of RVFV binding to the NanoTrap (1.2 and 0.8 log, respectively). However, HTP RVFV capture was more dramatically affected, resulting in a 2.5 log decrease with the NP-40 treated samples and a 2.7 log decrease in the heat inactivated samples. Collectively, our experiments demonstrate that while HTP is capable of capturing whole virus, it cannot protect viral RNA against RNase degradation and it displays a reduced ability to capture RVFV during an inactivation scenario. In contrast, NT53 is capable of capturing and protecting RVFV as well as capturing RVFV in samples that have been inactivated by heat or detergent treatment.",

Current RT-PCR-based assays require a critical amount of the virus circulating in the system. This can lead to misdiagnosis, especially falsenegative results, of the disease early on in infection. In contrast, our results demonstrate the ability of NanoTrap particles to enrich for RVFV from both cell culture supernatants as well as more complex matrices such as animal serum. The capability of NanoTrap particles to enrich virus is crucial early on in infection during which the virus can go undetected using other diagnostic methods. In our serum sample studies we noted different levels of enrichment depending on the source of the serum. For example, NanoTrap particles incubated in donkey serum resulted in a 52fold increase in RVFV detection sensitivity, whereas incubation in sheep serum only displayed a 3-fold increase. The presence of other analytes found in serum may be competing for capture with NanoTrap particles, which likely will differ between species as well Figure 7 .

Importantly we have also demonstrated the ability to capture RVFV in samples that also contained HIV. This is an important area of investigation, as clinical samples will likely contain multiple pathogens, providing further competition for NanoTrap binding. We hope to extend our spiked serum sample studies to experiments with serum samples taken from animals exposed to RVFV and human clinical samples. These studies will allow further optimization of the NanoTrap particle collection. In our current study we used very stringent wash conditions to ensure that the virus captured was tightly bound to the NanoTrap particles. In clinical samples, it may be necessary to decrease the number of wash steps to ensure that the maximum amount of virus is being captured from more complex samples. Alternatively, different wash buffers (altering salt and detergent concentrations) could be utilized to allow more selective binding of analytes. Due to the complex nature of clinical samples, it may also be necessary to increase the amount of NanoTrap particles added to prevent saturation. Nonetheless, our studies provide an important first step in the application of NanoTrap particles as a sample preparation and enrichment process to improve diagnostics from serum samples.",

Following inactivation, viral genetic material was still detected with qRT PCR and to a higher level than that observed with HTP beads. This is of particular importance in the transport of RVFV from a BSL-3 environment or field sample collection setting to a BSL-2 laboratory for diagnostic testing. Given that BSL-3 laboratories are both difficult to access and work in a BSL-3 environment is time-consuming and expensive, the inactivation method will allow for fewer lapses in time between obtaining the samples and the determining the results.

We hypothesize the NanoTrap particle capture is occurring through interactions with RVFV's glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Gn and Gc are the only viral proteins available for capture by virtue of being exposed on the outside of the virion. The fact that the binding observed with HTP beads slightly exceeded NT53 in binding RVFV may provide insight into the mechanism of binding. HTP is known to bind primarily through electrostatic interactions and similarly, Cibacron blue, the affinity bait component of NT53 binds through electrostatic, hydrophobic or a combination of surface and electrostatic interactions. Based on these results, we expect that electrostatic interactions may provide the dominant mode of NT53 binding to RVFV. Due to the size of the virus (90-100 nm) as compared to the size of the NanoTrap particles (800 nm), it is unclear if the viruses are entering inside the core of the NanoTrap particle or binding to the outside of the NanoTrap particles. We have observed preferentially binding of RVFV with NanoTrap particles containing Cibracon blue baits, suggesting that the bait plays at least a partial role in the binding. Even if RVFV binding is partially or primarily found on the surface of the NanoTrap particles, the particles provide a unique advantage over other commercially available beads, which is sequestration of analytes within the NanoTrap particles. This is important as many enzymes (proteases, RNase,etc.) found in serum can rapidly digest protein and RNA.

One potential disadvantage of larger pores sizes would be the loss of some of the sieve sieving capabilities of the particles. The size sieving is important for more complex samples (whole blood, sera, etc.), which would benefit from the ability of the NanoTrap particles to enrich for certain analytes (i.e. viruses) while excluding high abundant proteins such as BSA, which may interfere with downstream assays or mask lower abundant molecules such as low levels of viruses.

For example, respiratory infections can be attributed to multiple pathogens, including Influenza A and B viruses, Coronaviruses, and Adenoviruses.

Panels A and B: NT53 was incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 2.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then incubated at room temperature with 0.1, 0.5 or 1% NP-40 for 1 hour (NP-40). Control samples were not treated with NP-40 nor captured with NT53. Samples treated with NP-40 without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). Viral inactivation was assayed by plaque assays (A) and viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR (B). Panels C and D: NT53 was incubated with viral supernatants containing RVFV at 2.7E+8 pfu/ml for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then incubated at 57uC for 30 minutes, one hour, or two hours. Control samples were not heat treated nor captured with NT53. Samples heat-treated without NT53 were processed in parallel (black bars). Viral inactivation was assayed by plaque assays (C) and viral RNA was extracted from the particles with Ambion's MagMax 96-well Viral RNA extraction kit and quantitated by qRT-PCR (D). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002296.g004",
