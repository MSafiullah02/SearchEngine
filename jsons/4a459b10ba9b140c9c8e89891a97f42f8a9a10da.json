Fever, asthenia and anorexia worsened and an increase of inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin) was noted with a profound change in lipid distribution. Due to the evidence of inflammatory dysregulation and the unavailability of tocilizumab in our hospital, treatment with anakinra was introduced (100 mg every 6 hours subcutaneously for seven days). The patient was screened for HBV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: tests turned out negative. In addition, lopinavir/ritonavir was discontinued and the investigational antiviral remdesivir was started as compassioned use (loading dose 200 mg, followed by 100 mg every 24 hours intravenously for seven days).",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, we report the first treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra and rendesivir of a severe COVID-19 case ]. IL-1 is the apical pro-inflammatory mediator, inducing both its own production and the synthesis of several secondary inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 [Sonmez 2018]. Due to the possible role of IL-1/IL-6 axis blockade in conditions resembling MAS, the critical status of our patient, and the shortage of tocilizumab in our institution, we considered the administration of anakinra, in association with the most promising available antiviral agent and with adequate anti-thrombotic therapy [Shakoory 2016 , Tanaka 2019 . Indeed, another possible and even more frequent pathological mechanism seems to be immune dysregulation with a decrease in HLA-DR expression on CD14 monocytes and overproduction of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-6 [Giamarellos-Bourboulis 2020]. Although this process could not implicate the overexpression of IL-1, because it may not affect the expression of this interleukin [Giamarellos-Bourboulis 2020], the prompt resolution of fever, the reduction of inflammatory markers, and the improvement in the respiratory function observed in our patient are suggestive of a potential positive effect of anakinra. Nevertheless, the long-lasting positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 on pharyngeal swab specimens did not preclude the clinical recovery of the patients. As it was described in previous reports, this may suggest a long viral shedding, despite clinical improvement or resolution of symptoms [Yang 2020 ].",

Moreover, the progression of the lung consolidation detected on day 10 could be expression of ongoing viral infection and inflammation.
