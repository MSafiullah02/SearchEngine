The inhibitors are mostly formed by two sequential selfsupporting \u03b1-helices (bundle) extracted from the protease domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the \u03b1-helical peptides maintain their secondary structure and provide a highly specific and stable binding (blocking) to SARS-CoV-2. To provide a multivalent binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptors, many such peptides could be attached to the surfaces of nanoparticle carriers. The proposed peptide inhibitors could provide simple and efficient therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease.",

To engage a host-cell receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes transient hinge-like conformational motions (receptor-accessible or receptor-inaccessible states). 8 The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host cellular receptor with a higher affinity to SARS-CoV-2 than to SARS-CoV. 5 In the recognition of RBD, the protease domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly engages the \u03b1 1 -helix with a minor contribution from the \u03b1 2 -helix and the linker of the \u03b2 3and \u03b2 4 -sheets. 8, 9 In addition to a hectic search for vaccines against COVID-19, there is a very fast ongoing search for therapeutics acting on SARS-CoV-2. Depending on the activity, the therapies can be divided into several main categories: (1) preventing the viral RNA synthesis and replication, (2) blocking the virus from binding to human cell receptors, (3) restoring the host's innate immunity, and (4) blocking the host's specific receptors or enzymes. 10 Despite many experimental and computational studies currently exploring all of these categories, to date, there is no confirmed effective treatment specifically available for COVID-19.",

Unfortunately, most of these compounds do not attach with the binding interface of the RBD\u2212ACE2 complex. Hesperidin was predicted to lie on the surface of RBD, but it did not cover the whole interface. 10 In the early attempts of SARS-CoV blocking, short peptide inhibitors were studied and amino acid mutations were implemented to the S protein of SARS-CoV. 12, 13 However, the proposed peptide was too short (8 residues) to maintain secondary structure, so it was unable to block the whole SARS-CoV binding surface. 12 Broad-spectrum antiviral nanoparticles and cyclodextrins were designed, simulated, and implemented in blocking of other viruses. 14\u221216 They are category 2 or 3 inhibitors, but their applicability to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Proteins or rigid peptides with specific (multivalent) binding domains and conformations matching RBD could be promising therapeutics for COVID-19. Overall, protein therapies show a high specificity, small interference with biological processes, good tolerance to human organisms, and faster FDA approval times. 17 In this work, we design and simulate several peptide inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, which included components from the virus-binding domains of ACE2; based on the recently released crystal structure (PDB code: 6M17 9 ). The inhibitors, which have relatively low molecular weights, are structurally stable, they conformationally match the S protein, and are highly specific to SARS-CoV-2. This study could provide a potential guidance in antigen recognition and structure-based designs of antibodies with high affinities. The proposed small peptides could be used as inhaled therapeutics for topical lung delivery, providing an efficient way to combat COVID-19. 18 ",

In Figure 2a , 200 ns long simulations showed that the helical structure of inhibitor 1 deforms from the left side\ue0d5loose end unfolding, although it still binds to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. In Figure 2b \u2212d, 120\u2212 300 ns long simulations revealed that inhibitors 2\u22124 bind in a stable way to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, without \u03b1 1 losing its structure. Due to different linkages among the critical binding components, the overall conformations of inhibitors 2\u22124 vary. Specifically, the \u03b1 1 -helix, which mostly contributes to the complementary sequence and conformational matching to RBD, is maintained in inhibitors 2\u22124 with different degrees of bending. The \u03b2-sheets in the structures of inhibitors 3 and 4 are also preserved. Overall, the critical binding components in inhibitors 2\u22124 bind to RBD in a manner very similar to that of the crystal structure. The simulated stable conformation of inhibitors 2, 3, and 4 correspond to their energy minima of folding, which would drive the folding process toward the stable direction. ",

Figure 2f shows the average RMSD at the end of our simulations (see also Figure S1 ). Inhibitor 1 has larger RMSD for the critical amino acids compared to that of the control and the largest fluctuations for both the critical amino acids and the overall RMSD ( Figure S1a,b) . This can be attributed to unfolding of \u03b1 1 , shown in Figure 2a . A highly promising inhibitor 2 has a RMSD of the critical amino acids and the overall RMSD similar to those in the control (lowest). Inhibitor 3 has a RMSD of the critical amino acids and the overall RMSD higher than that of the control and inhibitors 1 and 2. However, Figure S1b shows that inhibitor 3 has a very smooth overall RMSD at later times. This may be due to a poor adaptation of their added connections at early times. Inhibitor 4 shows slightly bigger fluctuation for the overall RMSD but steady RMSD ( Figure S1a ) for the critical amino acids at later times, which indicates fluctuation shown in the overall structure comes from nonessential connection parts.",

The single \u03b1 1 -helix used in inhibitor 1 is less stable, whereas the \u03b1 1,2 -helices used in inhibitors 2\u22124 support each other and retain their bent shape, which provides a conformational matching to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and a full cover of the RBD surface. Precise conformational matching between the designed peptides and the virus provides room for improving the binding affinity, which should be considered in future inhibitor design protocols. Suitable inhibitors should have a selective binding with lower RMSD for critical amino acids and relatively high binding energies. The binding affinity could be further enhanced by a multivalent binding of multiple peptides attached to surfaces of nanoparticles, dendrimers, and clusters. In analogy to nanoparticle-based inhibitors, 14 we could attach to the \u03b1 1 helix a sulphonated ligand mimicking a heparane sulfate, which can attach to positively charged residues at the bottom of RBD. These inhibitors could be used as inhaled therapeutics, preventing the virus activation in lungs.",

The simulations were performed in the NpT ensemble (p = 1 bar and T = 310 K), using the Langevin dynamics with a damping constant of 1 ps \u22121 . After 2000 steps of minimization, ions and water molecules were equilibrated for 2 ns around proteins, which were restrained using harmonic forces with a spring constant of 2 kcal/(mol \u00c5 2 ). The last frames of restrained equilibration were used to start simulations of free inhibitors and partially constrained PD of ACE2 (two residues on the bottom).
