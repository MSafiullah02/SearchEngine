            "text": "Major public health threats have been on the rise over the past 50 years. Specifically, infectious diseases such as the AIDS epidemic in the late 1970s, followed by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-COV) in Asia (2002 Asia ( -2003 , pandemic H1N1 worldwide in 2009, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) in Saudi Arabia (2012), the re-emergence of Ebola virus in Africa (2014) , and the Zika virus in 2016. All these are examples of infectious diseases which are difficult to control, as they require real-time reporting to alert relevant surveillance systems. Social media and internet based data has shown to play a role in sending early warning signals to public health authorities to take an informed course of action to prevent and control the spread of such diseases. This noticeable increase in new emerging infectious diseases has led to several challenges facing public health officials operating at different levels, locally, nationally and globally, to take the right action at the right time. Addressing such challenges in the era of Information Technology (IT) has called for effective use of new emerging technology development and approaches towards detecting, tracking, reporting, forecasting, and improving early warning systems and proper response (Milinovich et al. 2014c ). Nevertheless, most infectious diseases are still being traditionally monitored by passive and reactive public health surveillance systems, which are officially maintained by national public health authorities. These traditional surveillance systems depend, to a large degree, upon data submitted to public health authorities by health professionals such as hospital physicians, laboratories, public health practitioners, and other health-care providers.",

Incomplete reporting leads to no detection of public health threats inclusive of missed on-time detection of infectious diseases. Moreover, the substantial lags between the occurrence of an event and its official notification is common among public surveillance systems due to a number of reasons that govern traditional surveillance systems performance, including the rigid hierarchical structure and verification process dealing with receiving and notification of infectious and communicable diseases. These reasons, among others, led to late or failed reporting of the event to those in charge to take the right action for containment and control of the spread of infectious diseases.",

It has been reported that there is, on average, a lag time of at least 2 weeks from receipt of the infectious disease event to dissemination of the data by traditional surveillance systems (Cheng et al. 2009 ) while the availability of data on the internet and social media has been viewed as playing a better role in accelerating the process of informing both the public and governments about any looming public health threat, especially relating to infectious diseases. We anticipate that these new technological improvements could provide a new platform to help improving the quality of detection and reporting of infectious diseases threats, utilizing the sensitivity and timeliness capabilities of digital-based surveillance systems.",

That is, social media is comprised of computer-mediated platforms depending on mobile and web-based technologies which allow people to create, share or exchange information, ideas, and pictures/videos in virtual communities and networks. Infectious diseases are the communicable diseases caused by different types of pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi (WHO 2015) . These types of diseases can spread, directly or indirectly, from one person to another. One of the current emerging sources of infectious diseases is the zoonosis of animals that can cause disease when transmitted to humans. Disease surveillance systems have been defined as the ongoing systematic collection and analysis of data and the provision of information which leads to measures being taken in order to prevent and control the spread of the disease (MedicineNet 2015). The disease surveillance systems primarily aim to detect, prevent, control and eradicate sporadic cases and outbreaks, including endemic, epidemic and pandemic, and other public health threats related to biological (viruses, bacteria, parasites, and their toxins) and chemical agents as well (Bernardo et al. 2013) . Digital surveillance is an internetbased surveillance system which attempts to provide real-time knowledge of public health issues by analyzing information stored digitally (Milinovich et al. 2014b, c) . There are now several digital systems being used consisting of non-structured, event-based, and digital data to enhance disease detection and public health responses (Anema et al. 2014; Brownstein and Freifeld 2007; Freifeld et al. 2008; Olson et al. 2015; Sturtevant et al. 2007 ).",

            "text": "Infectious disease surveillance is an epidemiological practice by which the incidence, prevalence and spread of infectious diseases are monitored in order to establish patterns of progression and activate measures of management and control. The main role of infectious disease surveillance is to predict, observe, and minimize the harm caused by outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemic situations, as well as increase knowledge of both practitioners and the public about which factors contribute to such circumstances (Choffnes et al. 2007 ). Reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping to instant worldwide internet communication ). Timely identification of infectious disease outbreaks is critical, both for effective initiation of public health interventions and control measures, as well as the timely alerting of government agencies and the general public at large. Surveillance capacity for such detection can be expensive, and many countries lack the public health infrastructure to identify outbreaks at their earliest stages. The Internet is revolutionizing how epidemic intelligence is activated, and it offers solutions to some of these challenges. Social media and freely available web-based sources of information may allow us to detect disease outbreaks earlier with reduced cost and increased reporting transparency (Wilson and Brownstein 2009 ). Furthermore, the search and exchange of health information on the Internet and social media has been viewed as an opportunity to improve public health surveillance (Velasco et al. 2014; Kass-Hout and Alhinnawi 2013) , and to monitor and predict emerging infectious diseases (Milinovich et al. 2014a, c) .

Systems using informal electronic information have been credited with reducing the time to recognition of an outbreak, preventing governments from suppressing outbreak information, and facilitating public health responses to outbreaks and emerging diseases. A huge amount of real-time data and information about infectious disease outbreaks is found in various forms of web-based data streams (Brownstein et al. 2008; Freifeld et al. 2008; Brownstein and Freifeld 2007) . The web-based data sources exist outside traditional reporting channels; therefore, they are invaluable to public health agencies that depend on timely information flow across national and subnational borders. These information sources, which can be identified through Internet-based tools and social media, are often capable of detecting the first evidence of an outbreak, especially in areas with a limited capacity for public health surveillance (Yang et al. 2013) . For example, the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network rely on reporting data for day-to-day surveillance activities (M' Ikanatha et al. 2004 Ikanatha et al. , 2006 ).

A number of online communities have been developed by patient organizations, providers, and nonprofit organizations. Such online communities are virtual forums where patients can discuss their health concerns and exchange information. Participation in online communities heightens levels of emotional wellbeing, perceived control over disease, overall personal empowerment, and level of public awareness and medical knowledge (Wicks et al. 2010 ). The large online population creates a vast network composed of individuals reporting on their activities, their social interactions, and the events around them. These colossal data chunks stream in real time, and are often annotated with context including GPS location, relationships, and images. Extensive data analytics and data mining of social media have been suggested for many applications, such as marketing and financial prediction (Kautz 2013) . Recently, researchers have begun to leverage sensor network for public health: preventing, detecting and fighting infectious diseases. Researchers have shown, for example, that Twitter postings can be used to track and predict influenza (Krieck et al. 2011; Sadilek et al. 2012) . Such work provides evidence that social media can provide data that helps identify early warning for public health threats. Some researchers have explored augmenting the traditional notification channels about a disease outbreak with data extracted from Twitter. By manually examining a large number of tweets, they showed that self-reported symptoms are the most reliable signal in detecting if a tweet is relevant to an outbreak or not. Researchers have also tried capturing the overall trend of a particular disease outbreak, typically influenza, by monitoring social media (Culotta 2010). Other researchers focus on more detailed modeling of the language of tweets and their relevance to public health in general (Paul and Dredze 2011) and to influenza forecasting in particular (Paul et al. 2014; Broniatowski et al. 2013) .",

Social media has the unique advantage of being rapid and can be updated in a timely manner. If properly and scientifically utilized, social media can provide a sensitive and user friendly tool to monitor the distribution and determinants of epidemics both locally and at a global level. For example, systems like GT, present a novel and free tool that allows users to search for information with ease on the internet. This tool can also provide useful clues for understanding characteristics of the disease and the healthrelated behavior that influences its occurrence (Nuti et al. 2014 ). The use of social media in infectious disease epidemiology is, however, a new method of surveillance that is emerging. However, with advances in its use, it has the potential of providing an accurate and rapid estimation of the progression of diseases within communities. In addition, social media can be a valuable tool in providing values in distinct climatic and socio-economic context (Gluskin et al. 2014) . Most developing countries do not have a periodically maintained and updated surveillance system for infectious diseases. Countries that own a functioning surveillance system suffer from delay in reporting and many sentinel sites miss out reporting of cases annually or periodically. Lack of resources in most developing countries also hinders communication, training of staff and provision of proper equipment (Madoff et al. 2011) . Thus systems like GT, social media and other internet sources can provide a rapid method of surveillance that predicts the real time burden of disease and hence can guide preventive and curative strategies. Systems like GT could also work as a complementary system along with the traditional surveillance system in countries which have already established such systems.",

Reliability of the data is also questionable as the source of information could be from trusted health specialists or from unofficial sources. Lack of standardization for frequency of updates further causes the problem to exacerbate, as too much information becomes available with questionable authenticity. Furthermore, applying algorithms and proper statistical techniques before making it publically available are not usually achieved. Robust monitoring and evaluation of the quality of data needs consideration for its proper usage of information retrieved from social media. (Velasco et al. 2014) 7",
