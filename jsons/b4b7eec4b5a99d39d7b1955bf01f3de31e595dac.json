Medical science , especially the contemporary Western version, is highly dependent on classifi cation systems or disease nosology, and a number of classifi cations systems are utilized to categorize health conditions. From a practical standpoint, epidemiologists, medical practitioners, and healthcare administrators must be able to place health conditions into appropriate categories for a variety of reasons, and the relevant system depends on the intended purposes. For example, the system used to classify physical illness differs from that used to classify mental illness.",

The use of modern diagnostic techniques and sophisticated biomedical testing equipment has complicated the classifi cation of disease as ever fi ner distinctions can be made between various syndromes. Part of the problem stems from controversy over exactly how \"disease\" should be defi ned. The reality is that disease syndromes are not necessarily clear-cut and mutually exclusive, diagnostic tests are far from precise, and conventional standards for defi ning diseases tend to shift in accordance with new research fi ndings, new treatment modalities, and even nonclinical developments. These problemsand the concomitant criticisms-are exacerbated when attempts are made at classifying disabilities or mental disorders . The systems that have been developed, therefore, although widely used, are not without their critics. Although less than perfect, these existing classifi cation systems provide the framework within which medical science operates.",

The most signifi cant step in this regard was the introduction of \"prospective payment\" as the basis for reimbursement for health services rendered under the Medicare program. Reimbursement is determined by the Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) that is assigned to the hospital episode. Under this arrangement, hospitals, physicians, and certain other providers of health services are informed at the beginning of the fi nancial accounting period of the amount that the federal government will pay for a particular category of patient as determined by their classifi cation into one of 753 DRGs (Advance Healthcare 2015 ). This is in stark contrast to the \"retrospective payment\" approach originally built into the Medicare program, which was essentially a cost-plus arrangement with no incentives for cost containment. The prospective payment system (PPS) limits the amount of reimbursement for service to each category of patient based on rates predetermined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS) , the federal agency that administers the Medicare program. Introduced by the federal government during the 1980s, DRGs represented an attempt to standardize the classifi cation of hospital patients whose care was being fi nanced by the Medicare program. DRGs represent a mixture of diagnoses and procedures . The primary diagnosis is modifi ed by such factors as coexisting conditions, presence of complications, patient's age, and usual length of hospital stay in order to create the 753 diagnostic categories currently in use. Exhibit 3.3 presents a sampling of DRGs along with their codes.",

Rather than a dichotomous concept , disability is a gradient on which every person functions at different levels due to personal and environmental factors. While the ICF provides a common language for discussion of the concepts associated with disability, operationalizing this framework for survey questionnaires remains a challenge. Surveys must contain questions about a fi nite set of activities and set thresholds for levels of functioning over time. Exhibit 3.8 presents categories of disability utilized by the ICF. Parts of this system have been adapted for use with federal surveys. In its supplemental questionnaires on adult and child functional limitations, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) contains questions about whether respondents had diffi culty performing a specifi c set of functional and participatory activities. For many activities, if a respondent reported diffi culty, a follow-up question was asked to determine the severity of the limitation.

The nature of the fi fth-digit modifi er varies depending on the disorder under consid-eration. (Exhibits 3.9 and 3.10 indicate the major classifi cations within DSM-V and present a representative sampling of the coding of mental disorders.) Unlike the other classifi cation systems discussed, the DSM system contains rather detailed descriptions of the disorders categorized therein. It may be worthwhile to present another conceptualization of the categories of mental disorder that is more straightforward (oversimplifi ed, some might say), but is both more useful for general discussions of mental illness and more in keeping with popular conceptualizations of mental disorders. The signifi cance of the various categories for the contemporary healthcare delivery system will be noted as each is discussed.",

Only a small fraction (approximately 5 %) of mental disorders fall into the organic category, and many would classify these as physical illnesses because of the presence of brain damage, neurological dysfunction, or chemical imbalance. The small proportion of cases is noteworthy, since they require almost total care and the signifi cance of this category is expected to increase as victims of Alzheimer's disease become more numerous. Brain-damaged patients generally do not benefi t from active medical intervention and are typically cared for in custodial-type institutions.",

It includes a variety of conditions that do not fi t neatly into the other categories. Included are such disorders as antisocial behavior, sexual deviance, and alcohol and drug abuse.

A cause of death is assigned to each deceased individual and registered through the standard death certifi cate that is used throughout the US. To the extent that cause of death can be considered as something of a proxy for morbidity, basic information on the assignment of cause of death may be informative. Historically, there was a fairly close correlation between common maladies and common causes of death. The immediate cause of death was typically the primary cause of death, with few complicating factors involved. That connection can still be made today to a certain extent, in that the leading causes of death (heart disease and cancer) refl ect common maladies within the population.",

In the US, the mortality rate has dropped to the point that death is a relatively rare event. As a component of population change, mortality has become less important than fertility and both have become less important than migration. Further, the correspondence between mortality and morbidity has become diminished. Because of the preponderance of chronic disease within the US population, death certifi cates are less and less likely to capture the underlying disease. Chronic diseases typically do not kill people, but those affected typically die from some complication (of diabetes, AIDS or cancer, for example). This is not to say that mortality analysis cannot provide insights into morbidity patterns, but that the situation is much more complicated than in the past, and analysts require a better understanding of disease processes (and the vagaries of death certifi cates) today.",

Populations in different times and places are subject to different causes of death. Knowing the number of people who died is one thing, but knowing what they died from provides valuable insights into the overall health status of the population and the types of health conditions that affl ict that population. Information on cause of death in the US is compiled from certifi cates fi led with health authori-ties on the occasion of any death. Since virtually every death is accompanied by a death certifi cate, the information on cause of death is fairly complete. However, given today's morbidity patterns, it is increasingly diffi cult to specify the ultimate cause of death. With a preponderance of chronic diseases, it is often the case that death can and should be attributed to a factor other than the proximate cause of death. For example, patients with AIDS do not typically die as a direct result of AIDS but due to system failure caused by AIDS. Similarly, individuals affected by diabetes are often said to die from \"complications of diabetes.\" While the immediate cause of death may be kidney failure, it is useful to know that diabetes was the underlying cause. Similarly, obesity, while not an immediate cause of death, is increasingly being listed as a contributing factor. While the death certifi cate provides space for the recording of contributing conditions, the complexity of chronic disease may make it diffi cult to determine the exact cause of death.",

There is not universal agreement as to the determination of which factor is the immediate cause of death. There are, in fact, differences that exist from community to community with regard to the classifi cation of contributing and proximate factors. There may also be a tendency, hopefully not widespread, to misrepresent the cause of death for various reasons. There may be reluctance, for example, to specify AIDS or some other sexually transmitted disease as a cause of death. Similarly, there may be reticence with regard to specifying alcoholor drug-related conditions as the cause of death . The slippage with regard to accurate classifi cation of cause of death is also exacerbated due to the trend toward employment of coroners who are not physicians. In fact, in some jurisdictions, the coroner may be an elected offi ce.
