            "text": "One key point of understanding is that Ang II is just one member of a family of angiotensin peptides produced by the RAS. Ang II consists of eight amino acids, which, like other peptides, has a free amino group at one end (N\u2010terminus) and a free carboxyl group (C\u2010terminus) at the other. Ang II can also be denoted as Ang\u2010(1\u20138), where the first amino acid is at the N\u2010terminus and the eighth amino acid is at the C\u2010terminus. Therefore, cleavage of amino acids from either end of the Ang II molecule can generate smaller peptide fragments (Fig. 3). For example, removal of the N\u2010terminus amino acid results in the generation of a peptide consisting of seven amino acids starting from the second amino acid of Ang II, and is denoted by Ang\u2010(2\u20138) (historically also known as Ang III). Of the fragments that can be generated from Ang II, only three are known to be physiologically relevant.\n9\n Two are derived from N\u2010terminus cleavage, Ang\u2010(2\u20138) (Ang III) and Ang\u2010(3\u20138) (Ang IV) and one formed by cleavage of a single amino acid from the C\u2010terminus, angiotensin\u2010(1\u20137) (Ang\u2010(1\u20137)). Ang III is formed following cleavage of the aspartate\u2010arginine bond of Ang II by aminopeptidase A, and Ang IV can be formed by further cleavage of Ang III by aminopeptidase B or N. Ang III shares many of the properties of Ang II with 40% of the pressor activity and 100% of the aldosterone stimulating activity. Ang IV has its own distinct receptor (AT4) and has central nervous system effects together with some opposing actions to Ang II.\n10\n Ang\u2010(1\u20137) is generated from cleavage of either Ang II or Ang I and has been the focus of much research since the discovery that it has biological functions that oppose those of Ang II.",

            "text": "Interest in alternative components of the RAS was re\u2010ignited in the year 2000 when two groups independently discovered an enzyme similar to ACE in human tissue.\n12\n, \n13\n This homolog of ACE was initially called hACE but has subsequently been named angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Although structurally similar to ACE, ACE2 has different substrate affinities and resists inhibition by ACE inhibitors. ACE2 is a zinc\u2010metalloproteinase and, like ACE, is a type\u20101 transmembrane protein. It consists of 805 amino acids with a single transmembrane alpha\u2010helical portion, an external N\u2010terminus portion containing the catalytically active enzyme and an internal inactive C\u2010terminus section. A transmembrane proteinase, ADAM 17 acts as a \u2018sheddase\u2019 releasing the active enzyme into the extracellular environment (Fig. 4).\n15\n The released ACE2 (soluble ACE2) is a carboxypeptidase, capable of cleaving a single amino acid from the C\u2010termini of its various substrates, including, Ang II, Ang I, des\u2010Arg9\u2010bradykinin, neurotensin 1\u201313 and kinetensin (see review by Burrell and colleagues).\n16\n Importantly, ACE2 can generate Ang\u2010(1\u20137) directly from Ang II or indirectly by cleaving Ang I into an inactive intermediate fragment, Ang\u2010(1\u20139), which is then cleaved by ACE to produce Ang\u2010(1\u20137) (Fig. 2). Of these two ACE2 pathways, the conversion of Ang II into Ang\u2010(1\u20137) is kinetically favoured 400\u2010fold compared to the conversion of Ang I to Ang\u2010(1\u20139).\n17\n, \n18\n\n",

The putative receptor for Ang\u2010(1\u20137) is the G protein\u2010coupled receptor encoded by the mas proto\u2010oncogene,\n14\n although other receptors may well exist.\n30\n Thus, ACE2 together with Ang\u2010(1\u20137) and the mas receptor represent an \u2018alternative\u2019 arm or axis of the RAS which may present a counterbalancing system to the deleterious ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis (Fig. 5). Clearly, ACE2 holds a central role in the RAS influencing both axes, as it is capable of simultaneously degrading Ang II and generating Ang\u2010(1\u20137) (Fig. 2).",

As portal resistance increases, a number of factors, including distension of the portal venous system, endotoxemia and oxidative stress result in the release of mediators, including nitric oxide, which dilate the mesenteric and systemic vasculature. Activation of compensatory mechanisms designed to restore functional blood volume results in sodium and water retention, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the development of a hyperdynamic circulation.

Importantly, however, this was associated with significant arterial hypotension and significant renal impairment in 22% of patients. In this study, plasma renin activity before treatment was a predictor of patients that would not tolerate treatment.\n74\n The explanation for this adverse effect is that the RAS is known to play a central role in the homeostatic response to vasodilatation in patients with portal hypertension. The RAS, together with other compensatory systems, the posterior pituitary (through vasopressin secretion) and the sympathetic nervous system, endeavors to restore circulatory volume and organ perfusion by inducing vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention. In patients with advanced cirrhosis, plasma renin, Ang II, ACE and aldosterone levels are all increased\n75\n and, within the kidney, Ang II is critical for maintenance of renal perfusion pressure and an adequate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). As liver disease progresses, the decrease in effective circulatory volume results in vasoconstriction of the glomerular afferent circulation, renal hypoperfusion and a fall in GFR. In response to renal hypoperfusion, Ang II selectively constricts the efferent glomerular arterioles; this restores glomerular perfusion pressure and GFR. The maintenance of adequate renal perfusion is therefore ACE dependent. Furthermore, ACE inhibition results in a rapid fall of GFR.\n76\n, \n77\n This adverse effect of RAS inhibition on renal function in patients with advanced cirrhosis represents a major disadvantage for the use of this class of drug for the treatment of portal hypertension.",

Treatment with A779 worsened experimental liver injury with increases in TGF\u2010\u03b21 and hydroxyproline levels; this infers that mas receptor stimulation plays a protective role in liver fibrosis.\n93\n Further compelling evidence for a beneficial role of Ang\u2010(1\u20137) has come from a recent rat study presented at AASLD 2007 by our group.\n97\n We demonstrated that Ang\u2010(1\u20137) infusion in bile duct\u2010ligated rats attenuated fibrosis as quantified using METAVIR fibrosis score, hydroxyproline content, and type 1 collagen mRNA expression.

Both axes are upregulated in liver disease, but presumably the balance between the two systems is critical in determining the net effect.\n92\n For many years researchers in the field of RAS have concentrated on blocking components of the \u2018classical\u2019 system in an attempt to reduce fibrosis. However, both ACE inhibitors and ARB have an impact on other components of the \u2018classical\u2019 RAS apart from Ang II, as plasma renin activity and Ang I levels increase following chronic therapy.\n105\n This, in part, explains the phenomenon of \u2018angiotensin II reactivation\u2019 and \u2018aldosterone escape\u2019 whereby chronic administration of an ACE inhibitor fails to completely suppress either plasma Ang II or aldosterone production.\n106\n, \n107\n, \n108\n The actual mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive, although non\u2010ACE\u2010dependent pathways involving enzymes like chymase, which is capable of generating Ang II, may play an important part.\n85\n, \n109\n Interestingly, ACE inhibitors and ARB have a profound impact on the \u2018alternative\u2019 system by causing significant increases in Ang\u2010(1\u20137).\n94\n, \n95\n, \n110\n, \n111\n It has been postulated that some of the beneficial effects observed with ARB and ACE inhibitors are mediated through Ang\u2010(1\u20137).\n28\n, \n29\n, \n112\n, \n113\n, \n114\n, \n115\n, \n116\n In support of this, ACE2 activity and gene expression are both increased in the heart by ARB or ACE inhibitors.\n112\n, \n117\n The elevated ACE2 activity in such tissues would result in both diminished levels of Ang II and simultaneous elevations in tissue Ang\u2010(1\u20137), thus tipping the RAS balance in favor of the \u2018alternative\u2019 axis.
