            "text": "There are different ways to model the spatial-temporal patterns in a continuously distributed population. One approach is to use the set of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) which incorporates both temporal and spatial processes at the same time [1], [2], [3]. PDEs are used to model a variety of ecological phenomenon such as the dispersal of species, ecological invasions, the effect of habitat geometry, and the formation of diffusion-driven spatial patterning [1]. These methods have shown that the movement of organisms can produce large-scale patterns in homogeneous environments and that the movement of multiple species can change the outcome of competition or predation in heterogeneous environments. Recently, the PDE approach has been used to model a spatial epidemic following the point release of a rapidly dispersing infectious agent. It was demonstrated that the resulting epidemic exhibits two distinct phases: the primary phase where the epidemic wavefront propates at constant speed and a secondary phase with a deceleration wavefront [3]. This approach can also be applied to understand the traveling waves of epidemics, such as those that have been observed in the spread of Dengue haemorrhagic fever [4]. Another approach is to use agent based models that follow each individual in the population [5], [6], [7]. Agent based models are either highly computationally demanding because they must include the several parameters of each individual agent, which for some models can consist of millions of agents, or they must assume some distribution of parameters across the set of agents without full empirical knowledge of the parameters of each agent.",

            "text": "Here we take a different coarse grained approach that captures important aspects of the spatial heterogeneity, yet is computationally simple, and can model specific cases of the spatial-temporal spread of disease. This approach is based on dividing the population into individual locations, called \u201cpatches\u201d. The spread of infectious diseases in each patch can be described by ordinary differential equations [8], [9]. In the simplest classical model, we model the number of susceptible people, S, and infected people, I, homogeneously distributed in each patch, by using the following set of ordinary differential equations(1)dSdt=\u03bcN\u2212(\u03b2N)IS,\n(2)dIdt=(\u03b2N)IS\u2212\u03b3I where N is the total number of people, \u03bc is the birthrate at which new susceptibles are added to the population, (\u03b2/N) is the contact rate, and \u03b3 is the recovery rate. Since we are concentrating on the transient response rather than long time behavior, these two equations are adequate and we do not need to include the death rate. The (\u03b2/N)IS term in Eq. (1) is called the mass action term. Here we use the form of this term with a 1/N dependence, sometimes described as the \u201cfrequency dependent transmission\u201d mass action term. Different dependencies on N for this term correspond to different assumptions as to whether diseases are spread proportionally to the number of infected people, the fraction of infection people, or some scaling that depends on the size of the population itself and how well mixed are the susceptible and infected people in that population. It is not clear what dependency on N is the most realistic one for this term. The form originally proposed by Hamer [10] and Kermack and McKendrick [11] was \u03b2IS which was based on an analogy to the kinetic rate constant of a first order chemical reaction between two well mixed chemical species. However, even chemical reactions, which become less well mixed as the reaction proceeds, display a different (and time dependent) dependence on N\n[12]. The review by McCallum et al. [13] concludes that \u201cincreasingly, the weight of evidence is that simple mass action (\u03b2IS) is not an adequate model in many situations. A clear default alternative has yet to emerge\u201d. With this uncertainty in mind, we have here chosen to use the (\u03b2/N)IS form of this term, which we have found useful in our previous studies [14], [15].",

We then compute the epidemics in each patch as the patches interact with each other. This patch approach provides a tractable way of modeling and studying the coarse grained spatial heterogeneity. We can then use these patch models to understand how the epidemics in a single patch are driven by its interaction with other patches and the injection of infected people into one of the patches.",

Liebovitch and Schwartz [14] derived the interaction between the patches in this form and showed that this formulation could also lead to useful new analytical and numerical results. Here we extend their study of multi-patch, flux-based models by including: (1) the annual driving term for the infection which has been shown to be very important in describing the nonlinear properties of epidemics [15], (2) the injection of infected people into a patch, and (3) more complex geometries of connections between the patches.",

The \u03b4k can induce either periodic or chaotic dynamics. We investigated both cases.

We studied two different dynamical regimes, where the intrinsic dynamics of the large patch was either periodic or chaotic. We used the parameters: \u03b3=100 yr\u22121, N1=106, N2=105, \u03b22/\u03b21=1, r12=0, r21=0.5, t0=50 and \u03bc1=\u03bc2=0.02 yr\u22121. Fig. 1\nshows the fraction of the susceptible and infected people in the large patch (solid line) and in the small patch (dashed line). The unperturbed base dynamical state is shown up to the time t0=50 yr during which time there is no flux of infected people between the patches (r12=r21=0). At t0=50 yr the flux of infected people starts from the small to the large patch (r12=0,r21=0.5). Four cases are illustrated in Fig. 1 for the periodic and chaotic regimes each with R=1.575 and R=15.75. We first consider the periodic regime for both values of R. Fig. 1(b) shows that for R=15.75, the injection of infected people from the small patch induces corresponding epidemics in the large patch. After time, that we call the \u201cinfected-induced transient time\u201d, the system to returns to its base dynamical state before the infectious people were injected. Fig. 1(c) shows that for R=1.575, the injection of infected people from the small patch also induces corresponding epidemics in the large patch. However, unexpectedly, there are also additional epidemics, which we call \u201cancillary\u201d epidemics, in the large patch even though the small patch has no epidemic at that time. These ancillary epidemics are not the result of new infected people entering the larger patch. What is happening here is that the first epidemics in the large patch pushes that patch into a new part of phase space, far from its original base dynamical state, causing the large patch to produce a second epidemic all by itself. We also studied how the presence of these ancillary epidemics depends on the rate of migration, r, from the small patch into the large patch. As r is decreased from 0.5 to 0.01, these additional epidemics decreased and the R=1.575 case then behaved as the R=15.75 case.",

There is only a brief phase delay in the timing of the epidemics in the series of patches. This is because the epidemics along the line of patches are not triggered by epidemics in each patch which are then passed on to the next patch. Rather, it is the small influx of infected people which moves rapidly through all the patches which excites each patch, almost simultaneously, off of its base dynamical state and into an epidemic. In the model shown in Fig. 5(d) with 3 patches and R=15.75, all the patches have one large simultaneous epidemic triggered by the injection of infected people. In both models, the infected-induced transient time is rapid and the system returns to its base periodic dynamical state is a short time.

The transient time to the epidemic at time T is the interval in time between 0 to T. Integrating Eq. (8) we get(9)S\u2248\u03bct where the susceptible people in time series are increasing linearly while the infected people are in stable state with I\u22480. The onset of the epidemic is determined from Eq. (2),(10)dIdt=\u03bbI where(11)\u03bb=\u03b2S\u2212\u03b3. The number of infected people will grow exponentially when the number of susceptible people S has increased so that \u03bb increases from being less than zero to being greater than zero, which from Eq. (11) implies that(12)S=\u03b3/\u03b2. Since the onset of the epidemic at t=T, Eq. (9) implies that(13)S=\u03bcT. Therefore combining Eqs. (12), (13), we find that(14)T=1\u03bc\u22c5\u03b3\u03b2=1\u03bc\u22c51R since R=\u03b2/\u03b3. This result is illustrated in Fig. 6(d) which compares too very different mathematical approaches, each with somewhat different limitations in their accuracy; namely, numerical finite difference integration and a global analytical approximation. Considering the variability of epidemics and the approximations in measuring them in the numerical computations and the approximations made in the analytical derivation, Eqs. (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), we note that both the analytical and numerical results have very similar functional forms, even though they are not equal. We consider the correspondence between the numerical and analytical form of this relationship valuable confirmation of the essential concept, namely, that the time to the first epidemic depends significantly and inversely on their reproductive rate R.",

We showed here how the intrinsic epidemics driven by an annual driving term and the injection of infected people into a patch can spread to other patches. The strength and timing of these subsequent epidemics depends on the strength and geometry of the migration between the patches and on the reproductive rate, R, of the disease. The most salient observation of the different conditions described here is that when R is close to 1, as is the case for SARS and bird flu, then the transients generated in the patches are of long duration and there are additional \u201cancillary\u201d epidemics that are not due to further input of infected people, but rather are a manifestation of the fact that the previous epidemic has pushed the dynamical state of the patch far from its base dynamical state. These ancillary epidemics may have important implications for policy makers deciding how to respond to additional epidemics after an initial induced event. In this regime of R=1.575 and periodic parameters, the initial epidemic is produced by injection of infected people. However, the subsequent ancillary epidemics do not correspond to the injection of additional infected people. That is, the ancillary epidemic represents a rebound of the system, rather than a second event of injected infected people. In addition we showed both analytically and numerically how the time to the first epidemic after the injection of infected people depends on the reproductive factor R.",
