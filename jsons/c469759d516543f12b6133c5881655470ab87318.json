Those concerned about biosafety risks of certain GOF experiments have used the term \"potential pandemic pathogens\" to denote the small subset of GOF research that poses a risk of widespread transmission of a highly virulent pathogen [2, 3] . The National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity refers to this small subset as GOF research of concern (GOFROC) [4] . The funding pause, which initially covered 18 National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded influenza virus and coronavirus projects, was reduced to 11 projects by December 2014. For comparison, a search of the NIH Reporter Database shows well over 200 projects naming influenza virus or coronaviruses in the title or abstract; thus the funding moratorium affects <5% of research on these viruses funded by the NIH.",

Indeed, public health officials from the United States have indicated [8, 9] that they use the mutations identified in the noted GOFROC experiments on influenza A(H5N1) virus [10, 11] to prioritize surveillance. Given that no pandemic of A(H5N1) influenza has occurred, there is no rigorous way to identify whether incorporating that information has improved the outcome of surveillance. Indeed, there are reasons to think that prioritizing strains showing those mutations might in some cases be misleading (Table 1) . Moreover, each of the variants identified as potential risk indicators in the GOFROC experiments had previously been identified as such in safe, non-GOFROC studies by using alternative approaches [24] , as shown in Table 1 .",

Research on each pathogen of concern requires a tailored, comprehensive assessment by experts across multiple disciplines, who consider the broad implications of conducting or curbing such research. Thus, current and future moratoria on such research should only be implemented with input and consensus from a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including the community of clinicians and other healthcare providers who are the end beneficiaries and users of such research but who have historically been underrepresented in the policy discussions on this topic.
