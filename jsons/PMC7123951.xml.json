Therefore, disaster medicine was created as a broad specialty grounded in emergency medicine, but utilizing the skill sets of other surgical and medical specialties, and only able to become operational in combination with the systems supported by disaster management. For example, during an earthquake, several specialties are involved in the response and immediate care of the victims: emergency physicians, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and orthopedics; however, other subspecialties are also required in the ongoing care of victims. These include nephrologists to treat acute renal failure related to crush syndrome, both during and following the event, and psychosocial and rehabilitation specialties for continued care. These medical and surgical specialists are only able to perform their roles under the umbrella of disaster management. Without being enabled by the logistics and operations capabilities seen in a large-scale disaster response, these specialists would not be functional.",

Natural disasters, such as floods, tsunamis, and earthquakes, typically have a more extensive impact on population centers, causing more disruption. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 ravaged Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida causing death, numerous casualties, mass evacuations, and disruptions. Natural disasters also include epidemics. In the past, cholera, bubonic plague, and other diseases affected entire continents causing millions of casualties. Today, non-intentional outbreaks and pandemics such as influenza outbreaks and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are just two examples of natural disasters that for several reasons can spread quickly, ravaging entire communities. The Spanish flu in the early 1900s caused more than 50 million deaths, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, (SARS) that arose from China in 2003, resulted in thousands of death in that part of the world and concern for a global pandemic. Another virus that afflicts and kills millions of people, particularly in the poor areas of Africa and developing countries, is HIV. It is estimated that from the 1980s, HIV has caused more that 30 million deaths around the world. An estimated 97 % of natural disaster-related deaths occur in developing countries (World Bank, 2000\u20132001) [2].",

There were more than 100 deaths and more than 200 casualties from that disaster. The transportation industry is commonly involved in incidents that cause large numbers of injured and dead. In 1998 in Eschede, Germany, a high-speed train derailed causing 101 fatalities. Other industrial sectors, such as the chemical industry, have also been involved in man-made catastrophes. In December 1984 in Bhopal, India, more than half a million people were exposed to methyl isocyanate. In the immediate phase after the leak, almost 10,000 people died. The Indian Government has calculated that this event has caused over the years almost 600,000 casualties due to lingering effects of the chemical exposures [3, 4].",

These measures involve multiple different agencies and commissions, for example, policy-makers introducing regulations regarding the storage, transportation, and disposal of chemical substances. Another example of mitigation is to empower a public health system to monitor and conduct surveillance for infection diseases and at the same time introduce rules regarding health screening at the borders. The importance of the mitigation phase is to avoid disaster or to reduce the impact on the population. It is clear if we compare the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, with a magnitude of 7.0, and similar earthquakes in Japan where despite the same magnitude the number of dead and injured were more limited, that we see the effect of a disaster is often dependent on the underlying condition of the area affected. For decades, Japan has introduced strict building codes that follow seismic regulations. Nevertheless, it is not possible to fully mitigate against all disaster events. For instance, the 2011 earthquake in the Pacific Ocean produced a tsunami that hit the east coast of Japan and caused severe damage, in particular a failure of the nuclear plant in Fukushima, with release of radiation that affected the local community.",

Preparedness involves an integrated combination of assessment; planning; procedures and protocols; training and exercises; personnel qualifications, licensure, and certification; equipment certification; and evaluation and revision [8]. The first step of preparedness is defining what events are more likely to hit a community. The Hazard and Vulnerabilities Assessment (HVA) is a way to objectively risk-stratify those hazards that are more likely to strike a given community. The HVA takes into account different events: natural, man-made, and CBRN (chemical, biologic, radiological, and nuclear). The output from an HVA prioritizes the risks to which a population is most susceptible and should therefore be prepared for. After the HVA, it is possible to then establish standard operating procedures (SOP) and the emergency operations plan (EOP) for the community or hospital. It is a good rule that the EOP adopts an all-hazards approach to preparedness, with annexes and appendices specific for every type of probable event [9]. An important part of the preparedness phase is training. In particular, every healthcare professional must be trained when to activate a disaster response and their own specific roles and responsibilities within the framework of the response. The typical drills commonly used are tabletop and full-scale exercises. They are important also to identify shortfalls, bottlenecks, and gaps in the EOP. The staff should take part in the training, and the EOP should be tested, reviewed, and updated at least once per year.",

            "text": "Response is the phase in which agencies and sections with responsibility to deploy to disasters activate their emergency response plan as a result of specific threats or situations and can incorporate local, regional, and federal response agencies [10]. The response is conducted through the intervention of several agencies and must be flexible and adaptable for any type of event. It is important to immediately establish a response framework with a unified command structure that establishes a chain of command, control, and coordinate the resources, in terms of staff, stuff, and structure. The Incident Command System (ICS) provides a structure to enable agencies with different legal, jurisdictional, and functional responsibilities to coordinate, plan, and interact effectively on scene [11]. The medical response is provided at the scene by the emergency medical services (EMS), with triage, treatment, and transport to the hospitals. EMS plays a crucial role in the immediate phase of the response to disaster. The response must be quick and effective on the scene as well as in the determination of hospital destinations for every patient, to guarantee an appropriate standard of care and to avoid bottlenecks and congestion at hospitals. Rarely, EMS is able to triage, treat, and transport every single patient from the scene. Often some casualties reach the closest hospital on their own, giving rise to disruption in the chain of triage and to the hospital. The ability of a healthcare system to suddenly expand its capacity beyond normal services to meet the increased demand for qualified medical staff and services during a large-scale event is defined as \u201csurge capacity\u201d [12]. The surge capacity depends on the features of the healthcare system, but also by an effective EOP and training of the staff.",

Survivors from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers not only had immediate treatment in the field and in the hospitals that day, but their treatment has continued for years. The majority of people exposed to disasters do well; however, some individuals develop psychiatric disorders, distress, or risky behaviors such as an increase in alcohol or tobacco use [14]. The Department of Health and Human Services spent months and years following the 9/11 attacks and has gone on to provide health care, both physical and mental, to those who were, and continue to be, affected and in need [15]. The recovery phase often also involves rescue workers as their exposure to the traumatic event has a severe impact on their mental health. Studies confirm that rescue workers are prone to have diseases or documented behavioral health disturbances following events. For example, several articles describe how the acute and prolonged exposures were both associated with a large burden of asthma and posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms years after the 9/11 attack.",
