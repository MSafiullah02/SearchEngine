            "text": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating condition involving the brain and spinal cord, which presents clinically with new-onset polyfocal neurologic features, which by definition include encephalopathy.1 The MRI shows characteristic multifocal demyelinating abnormalities. There is often a history of infection or immunization, and ADEM is considered a postinfectious/parainfectious condition. This condition is a common cause of encephalitis in children and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with acute febrile encephalopathy and altered sensorium with or without fever. Children with ADEM respond well to immunosuppressive treatment (steroids) with the majority having a single event, i.e., a monophasic course. A small proportion of children with ADEM may have relapses, and in this subset, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a diagnostic consideration. In this chapter we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, investigations, treatment, and outcome of ADEM in children.",

This implies that the confirmation of the monophasic course requires follow-up and can only be done retrospectively.4.Brain MRI is abnormal during the acute (3 months) phase.5.Typically on brain MRI, there are diffuse poorly demarcated, large (>1\u20132 cm) lesions involving predominantly the cerebral white matter. T1 hypointense lesions in the white matter are rare. Deep gray matter lesions (e.g., thalamus or basal ganglia lesions) can be present.\n",

Although, overall, these patients showed a satisfactory global performance, a number of children demonstrated isolated deficits in one or more cognitive domains, most frequently the attentive and executive domains.9 Greater vulnerability to cognitive dysfunction and behavioral problems has been noted in ADEM patients diagnosed before the age of 5 years.56 Optic nerve involvement at presentation23 and antecedent viral infection24 have also been suggested as indicative of a poor outcome. In a recent study of the long-term neurocognitive outcome of children with ADEM, the most common residual symptoms were concentration difficulties (30%), behavior problems (28%), and learning difficulties (26%).55 On the Kaufman intelligence test, a full-scale IQ of more than 85 was found in only 60% of patients, and 44% of patients fulfilled the criteria for ADHD. Male gender was a predictor for a worse neurocognitive outcome in this study.55 The attention and behavioral impairment in ADEM may be attributed to the cerebral white matter damage that may interfere with information processing and attention skills, which are critical for emotional functioning and behavioral regulation.56 When persisting symptoms continue after ADEM, persisting chronic immune activation should be considered, and a retrial of immune therapy can be used to determine if there is a reversible cause for ongoing symptoms.",
