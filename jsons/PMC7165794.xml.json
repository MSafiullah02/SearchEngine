            "text": "Rotaviruses rank among significant causes of gastroenteritis in the majority of vertebrates. Data on their prevalence in human populations attest to their significance. A total of 110\u2013140 million cases of gastroenteritis caused by rotaviruses with high mortality in children, particularly in developing countries, are annually reported (Bajolet and Chippaux\u2010Hyppolite, 1998; Parashar et al., 2003). It follows that rotaviral infections play a significant role in farm animals kept under much worse hygienic conditions. Besides rotaviruses, two coronaviruses \u2013 transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) \u2013 rank among the economically most important viruses causing diarrhoea in pigs. Rotaviruses, which are about 75 nm, with double\u2010stranded RNA genome, are highly resistant to the conditions of external environment and to both chemical and physical agents (Ramos et al., 2000; Fischer et al., 2002). They replicate mainly in enterocytes covering small intestinal villi and are spread via the faecal\u2013oral route (Benfield et al., 1982; Debouck and Pensaert, 1983; Gelberg et al., 1991). Previously, all rotaviruses were considered antigenically related, containing common Vp6 antigen (group A rotavirus) with Mr 41K. Later, rotaviruses without the common antigen were classified as so\u2010called non\u2010group A rotaviruses. Seven antigenically distinct groups of rotaviruses (A\u2013G) were described; four (A, B, C and E) of them are pathogenic for pigs. Group A rotavirus which is the most often (67.8\u201395.4%) causal agent of rotaviral gastroenteritis (Sigolo de San et al., 1986; Janke et al., 1990; Pongsuwanna et al., 1996) comprises a series of subgroups and serotypes according to antigenic analysis of Vp4 and Vp7 proteins present in the outer capsid of virion. Common group A rotavirus Vp6 antigen is found in the inner capsid of virion, and rotaviral infections caused by that agent may be diagnosed by use of specific Vp6 antibodies regardless of animal species affected.",

Congruency of both EM and CB\u2010ELISA examinations thus suggest the share of rotavirus A in all cases of gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus. In the remaining seven (26.9%) EM\u2010positive but CB\u2010ELISA\u2010negative samples the presence of non\u2010group A rotaviruses is supposed. This is supported both by identical results of examination of five of these samples by DAS\u2010ELISA kit (Table 3) and by demonstration of group C rotavirus electropherotype (results not shown) in one EM highly positive sample. Determination of electropherotypes in the remaining six samples with low rotavirus contents by EM was unsuccessful.",
