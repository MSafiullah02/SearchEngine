Briefly, aliquots (5 \u03bcl) of each extension reaction, without or with transliteration reaction, were transferred to 96-well plates (96-well PCR thermo polystyrene plates, Costar Technologies, Coppell, TX, USA). Hybridization buffer (25 \u03bcl of 2 \u00d7 Tm, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.2 M Tris, and 0.16% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) contained microspheres, each carrying approximately 2500 target-specific probes. The microspheres were vortexed and sonicated for 20 s. The total volume was adjusted to 50 \u03bcl by adding 20 \u03bcl of ddH20. ddH2O (25 \u03bcl) was added to each background well (negative control). The temperature (56 \u00b0C) to be used in the Luminex hybridization was chosen in a pilot experiment. Hybridization was performed accordingly to the direct hybridization protocol (DHA) provided by Luminex: 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, cool to 56 \u00b0C at a speed of 0.1 \u00b0C/s, and 15 min at 56 \u00b0C. The Tm buffer (25 \u03bcl of 1\u00d7) contained streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (2 \u03bcg, PJRS14, PROzyme, Hayward, CA, USA), added to the hybridization mixture, which was then incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 5 min. Hybridization reactions were carried out in triplicate, with no-target controls (\u201cbackground\u201d wells contained sample buffer) run in replicates of 6. Beads were analyzed for internal bead color and R-phycoerythrin reporter fluorescence using a Luminex 200 analyzer (Luminex xMAP Technology, Luminex) and the xPonent Software solutions. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was computed for each bead type in the sample. The instrument's gate setting was established before the samples were run and was maintained throughout the course of the study.",

Reactions were executed with viral RNA simulants (5 ng per reaction) or MERS viral full genomic RNA (104 genomes). Aliquots of the reaction mixture (4 \u03bcl of each 20 \u03bcl) were loaded on a 2.5% TBE gel and visualized by the ethidium bromide staining. (B) Luminex DHA performed with amplicons generated by multiplexed RT\u2013PCRs and by dC-to-dZ transliteration (conversion) or extension without transliteration (extension) reactions. Luminex samples were undiluted PCR products. Background, negative control, and sample buffer were added to the Luminex mixture. The panel from the right indicates viral targets and Luminex bead identities. The panel on the bottom displays Luminex profiles summary for standard (AGTC, extension, red bars) versus AEGIS (AGTZ, conversion, blue bars) amplicons. (C) AGTZ amplicons Luminex profiles: Standard-AEGIS versus SAMRS\u2013AEGIS PCR products and extension with transliteration. The average of the three independent experiments is presented. MFI: median fluorescence intensity (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). The viruses were InfA, InfB, RSV, SARS, and MERS (104 pfu). Prim: primers control.
