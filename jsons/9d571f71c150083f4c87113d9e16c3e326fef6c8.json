A study of respiratory infections in a healthy adult population during the 1987 Australian winter. Family Practice 1993; 10: 378-386. During the 1987 Australian winter, respiratory illness patterns were studied in a population of 454 healthy adults, aged 18-59, over a period of 45 days. These patterns were matched with data obtained from laboratory diagnoses for respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and bacteria. Influenza B/1/86 was by far the most prevalent pathogen but other viruses including influenza A, paramyxoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus OC-43 were also present, either alone or in combination during the sampling period. Overall, 92 males and 101 females experienced one episode, 12 males and 22 females experienced two episodes and four females experienced three episodes. However, there were only 52 instances of viral or M. pneumoniae infections, of which 37 had a defined aetiology, while the remainder were clinically silent. No bacterial pathogens could be detected from throat swabs taken from 15 of 37 volunteers in whom a viral infection was detected, or from 43 of 70 volunteers who did not experience such infections. The study indicates that major deficiencies in our understanding of the aetiology of respiratory viral illness are probably due to methodological problems in obtaining laboratory diagnoses for many respiratory viruses, and that great difficulties exist in establishing an aetiology for respiratory infections based upon clinical symptoms alone.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Although respiratory viral and mycoplasmal infections are major causes of morbidity in healthy adults, it is surprising how few comprehensive aetiological data are available, even at the times of greatest incidence which, in temperate climates, are the winter months.

Large-scale studies to determine the aetiology and patterns of infection have been uncommon and are usually undertaken to determine responses to antiviral chemotherapy.

A total of 85 acute blood samples, nasal washings and throat washings were obtained and this figure included 11 specimens that were obtained from volunteers on two occasions.

Symptoms were recorded by each volunteer on a severity scale of 0-3 for 45 days, which encompassed the intended period for medication. Symptom cards were examined by nurses during weekly visits to the clinics. At these visits volunteers were also required to provide additional nasal and throat wash specimens and blood samples for serology in order to maximize the chances of detecting a viral infection around the time of an illness when acute samples were taken (see above). The range of illness categories was designed to include both upper and lower respiratory tract illness and symptoms caused by previously described side effects of rimantadine, which included anxiety, insomnia, light headedness, difficulty in concentrating and irritability. 4 Upper respiratory tract episodes (URTEs) and generalized influenza episodes (GIEs) were determined objectively by a symptom complex algorithm modified from one previously described in a study on the prophylaxis of common cold viruses with interferon. 3 Briefly, the ratings for all symptoms were added to produce a daily total symptom score (DTSS). In order to allow for many individuals experiencing persistent symptoms during winter that were apparently unrelated to infections (i.e. continuous 'runny' nose), the DTSS for each type of episode was reduced by the whole number of the daily average score for the relevant symptoms over the trial period. Thus, if an individual was assigned a score of '1' for 'runny nose' over the whole trial period interspersed with an occasional sneeze to produce an average daily score of 1.1, the scores for both URTEs and GIEs were reduced by 1 on each day. Any adjusted DTSS above zero for a particular day was added to that for the next 2 days. If the combined score was 4 for URTE symptoms or 6 for GIE, an episode was considered to have started. An episode was considered to have ended when the adjusted DTSS was zero and was followed by an adjusted DTSS of <2 on the following day.

When a CPE was noted, the culture was retained for characterization. Negative cultures were passaged up to three times and then discarded. Additional aliquots of both nasal and throat washings from volunteers who seroconverted to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were reinoculated to the same cells in a further attempt at isolation. Re-culture was also attempted on nasal and throat washings in MDCK cells in volunteers who were initially IFA positive for influenza A or B viruses but culture negative. In addition to acute samples, attempts to culture virus during the prodromal period were also made from routine nasal washings collected the week before the recorded occurrence of fever (^38.5\u00b0C), to maximize the chances of isolation. 8 For either test, 4-fold or greater increases in titre were the criteria for an antibody response. Figure 2 shows the age distribution of episodes of respiratory illness (URTE and/or GIE) as defined by the algorithm described above.

Many more episodes of respiratory illness were detected in the test population than could be accounted for by the diagnostic tests used in the study. Influenza infections were the primary focus of the study and influenza B/AA/1/86 was by far the most predominant pathogen. No attempts were made to screen for Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR), which is now recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity, 9 ' 10 or human coronavirus 229E, which is a significant upper respiratory tract pathogen.\" No rhinoviruses or adenoviruses were isolated and nor were other less common respiratory pathogens such as echoviruses, Coxsackie viruses or enteroviruses. Eight of 47 viral infections were asymptomatic, as were all four proven infections due to M. pneumoniae. A greater rate of seroconversion in symptomatic volunteers without evidence of infection would probably have been detected if a serological test more sensitive than the complement fixation procedure had been used for RSV, adenovinises and M. pneumoniae. Infections due to RSV occurred in three older volunteers, which is consistent with suggestions from other studies that suggest that RSV is a cause of significant respiratory morbidity in adults 12 ' 13 and severe pneumonia in the elderly. 14 We were able to detect viruses by culture or IFA in only 13 of 37 acute nasal and/or throat washings in volunteers who had experienced a clinically defined illness with aetiology demonstrated by retrospective serology. Our isolation rate would have undoubtedly been improved by the application of more sensitive procedures that do not involve cell culture, including the use of the polymerase chain reaction and time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays that were not available at the time of this study. Female volunteers appeared to experience more episodes of infection than males, especially in the younger than 20 and 31-35 year cohorts ( Figure 2 ). This could be due to greater exposure to infection in households through contact with children although, surprisingly, there were no trends in incidence according to the number of children in the households of either male or female volunteers (unpublished observations). There was no substantial difference in the incidence of episodes experienced by non-smokers (comprising 27% of the study population) and smokers with differing habits. However, these data are unlikely to be representative of either smokers or nonsmokers, which is reflected in the occupational status of the subjects and the prevalence of smoking which is approximately twice a recently reported Australian level. 13 Previous comparative studies have indicated an increased incidence of respiratory infections among smokers. 16 Of interest is the range of single and dual infections by viral pathogens that appear to produce clinically indistinguishable symptoms. These findings do not bode well for the widespread therapeutic application of newer respiratory antiviral drugs, which are likely to be highly specific in their mode of action for particular respiratory viruses, most of which have relatively short phases of acute illness. Such antiviral drugs could not be used without major advances in the accessibility of rapid viral diagnostic techniques (within 12-24 hours) and similar considerations apply to evaluations of the efficacy of influenza vaccines according to clinical outcomes. Although we obtained bacteriological results from 58 individuals with defined episodes of respiratory illness, of whom 15 had an established viral infection, our study also provides no basis for the prophylactic use of antibiotics in normal adult populations. The profile of bacteria from acute samples taken from volunteers with and without concurrent viral infection was no different from that of others before entry to the study and there was no evidence of synergism involving changes to the bacterial flora of the respiratory tract following viral infection. The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory viral infections is a severe impost of modern health care budgets and it is especially interesting that, despite the limitations of our bacteriological sampling, no group A P-haemolytic streptococci were isolated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1367, "end": 1369, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2702, "end": 2704, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2815, "text": "16", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2005, "end": 2013, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Above all, our study demonstrates that for the Australian winter of 1987 where the infection was predominantly caused by influenza B/AA/1/86, the cause of the illness could not be detected according to clinical symptoms alone.
