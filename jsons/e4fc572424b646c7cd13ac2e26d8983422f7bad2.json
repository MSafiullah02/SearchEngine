            "text": "W ith the emergence and exponential spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the utility and recommendations of face masks and respirators (ie, N95 masks) for various populations have come into question. [1] [2] [3] Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that the use of face masks is only for those caring for individuals with suspected COVID-19, or for those with active coughing or sneezing, inappropriate purchasing and use by the general public have led to a critically diminishing supply of face masks and respirators. 3, 4 This limitation in supply is especially concerning, given the exponential increase in cases of disease from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide. Health care workers (HCWs), notably those in more impoverished countries, continue to be at particular risk and are faced with using substandard options. [4] [5] [6] The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has suggested that the use of substandard optionsincluding surgical masks, cloth masks, and extended use or reuse of respirators-can be considered, with exercised caution. In this commentary, we attempt to characterize the utility of and provide considerations for the use of these substandard face mask options by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Thus, those persons wearing standard surgical face masks are still at risk for droplet exposure via the lateral, unsealed portions of the face mask. 4-6 On the contrary, standard respirators approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), namely N95 masks, are fit and seal tested to ensure filtration of at least 95% of airborne droplets. Few studies characterizing efficacy of cloth masks exist. To a lesser extent, viral transmission occurs by spread of microdroplets from contaminated surfaces onto the face, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal mucosa. Therefore, most mask options are intended for single use only, and must be carefully doffed and disposed.

This filtration efficacy decreases to 95% for particles 100-300 nm in size. N95 respirators are sold by manufacturers only when a 95% filtration efficacy standard per NIOSH requirement is met. Similarly, N99 and N100 respirators correspond to 99% and 99.7% filtration efficacies for particles 100-300 nm in size, respectively. 10, 11 On the contrary, surgical face masks are not required to meet similar filtration efficacy standards to be sold. Depending on manufacturers and the use of NIOSH filtration standards, surgical face masks have widely reported filtration efficacies ranging from <10% to \u226490%. Aside from filtration efficacy, risk reduction associated with surgical masks is heavily reliant on good fit and facial seal.",

There was no appreciable difference in risk reduction between surgical face masks and respirators (N95 face masks). Interestingly, the benefit of either mask was significantly dependent on adherence of face mask use. Moreover, Aiello et al 13 observed that the risk reduction of viral contraction with surgical face mask use was significant with concomitant hand washing practices. Such findings collectively suggest that the adherent use of even suboptimal face masks, along with recommended hand washing practices, may provide meaningful decrement in the risk of contracting respiratory viral illnesses.",
