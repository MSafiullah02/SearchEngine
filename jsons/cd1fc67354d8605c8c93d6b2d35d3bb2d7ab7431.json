Researchers have shown that even simple empirical models stemming from biological growth modeling have the potential to provide useful information on the development and severity of ongoing epidemics since they can be employed as tools for carrying out projections on the size of the affected population, timing of turning points, as well as best-and worst-case scenarios. Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input parameters' variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a transient or stable state. Meta-projections can be extracted from graphs of successive estimations of model's parameters and resulting projections, over a sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words, projections are carried out on truncated timeseries of cumulative numbers of confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for well-described, settled-growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta-projections and compared our findings for countries at different stages of the epidemic with stable or unstable behaviors and increasing or decreasing numbers of confirmed cases. Our results indicate that meta-projections can aid researchers in assessing the appropriateness of their relevant models and in effect decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic's severity and development.",

Countries that have managed to control the outbreak are working on avoiding a second outbreak while countries with ongoing pandemic development are striving to contain the disease dispersion in the society. Empirical growth models such as Richards' [3] (aka the Generalized Logistic Curve) have shown the potential to evaluate the severity of outbreaks. In retrospective studies, Richards' model has been demonstrated to fit well to epidemic data, such as those coming from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan [4] . Zhou and Yan used the Richards' curve to model the confirmed cumulative number of SARS cases in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Beijing [5] . In another work, Hsieh and Cheng [6] employed the Richards' model to fit the SARS data for Toronto where a multi-stage outbreak was recorded. It was established that the model can be effectively employed to project turning points and to demonstrate the disease severity in multi-wave epidemics. In another work, Hsieh et al. [7] employed the Richards' model to fit daily cumulative cases' data from the 2003 SARS outbreaks in Taiwan, Beijing, Hong Kong, Toronto, and Singapore. Using different lengths of the respective time series, they demonstrated that the model can be used to analyze the epidemic retrospectively and identify the significance of various events occurring at different times during the outbreak, and further, that the carrying capacity, (or the maximum projected number of cumulative cases), can be estimated in real-time by the method.",

On the other end, the SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Removed) model considers the mechanisms of transmission within the population. One of differences between the SIR and Richards' model is that the employed exponent in the latter does not seem to have a direct epidemiological correspondence, in contrast to SIR model where all of its parameters exhibit direct physical interpretations. It has been shown, however, that the exponent of Richards' model does have an indirect epidemiological explanation with reference to the SIR model [10] . In this work we built on previous studies and propose an approach by which, in addition to real-time forecasts and projections, successive estimations of the model parameters and analysis of their history allow us to identify phases of stability or epidemiological transitions in the modeled case. Additionally, converging parameter histories allows, up to a certain degree, to establish the reliability of the current forecasts.",

The effective reproduction number represents values that change over time as the susceptible population changes. If the effective reproduction number becomes less than 1, then the disease will die out. Essentially, the basic reproduction number is the maximum value of the effective reproduction number which is calculated as an infected individual enters a fully susceptible population.

Further to this, and since we employ a sequential quadratic approach for solving the problem, we need to estimate an appropriate starting vector q0\uf0ceQ, which will lead the optimizer efficiently to a reasonable solution.

The NCG diagram, as presented here, can provide clear and strong evidence of whether we are in the downturn phase or if we are still riding the \"skyrocketing\" phase.

All timeseries have been acquired from the same official and credible sources [1] , [2] . For these countries, the results can lead to a more accurate Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) calculation. The number of tests per confirmed case for selected countries (given availability of information), are shown in Table 1 : Therefore, the deaths-to-cases ratio can provide a relatively accurate depiction of current CFR in those countries with high number of tests per case. At the time of writing, this is valid for Greece and Cyprus, and at a lesser extent, for Italy, Sweden, and Turkey. Furthermore, in the countries with high number of tests per case, projections are more representative of the actual number of cases and may be less impacted by \"hidden\" cases of asymptomatic people. In Cyprus, which has the highest number of tests per case in our table, the current CFR estimate equals 1.6% but still, additional testing might be required for identifying asymptomatic people and establishing a more accurate figure; follow-up studies will consider the updated information. Conclusions regarding the accuracy of reporting and testing can also be drawn from Figure 4 . For example, in Iran, the first death due to COVID-19 appears on the same day as the first case, which would not make sense since an average number of 18 days is reported as the time from diagnosis to death for these patients [16] . In Turkey and Netherlands this delay period is around a week, which might signify a late confirmation of the first cases, while for the remaining of the examined countries, a period of two weeks or more is recorded, which is more reasonable given our current understanding of the disease. Another important consideration is the slope of the death to cases ratio. Constant deaths-to-cases ratios (zero or small slope values) could signify effective testing and accurate reporting and/or efficient handling of the disease by the corresponding healthcare systems. On the other hand, in Sweden and Belgium, as an example, the deaths-to-cases ratio keeps increasing [17] , which could be due to reporting inconsistencies and/or exceeding healthcare system's capacity. Specifically, on April 20 th the healthcare systems of both countries 4 had considerably less available ICU beds than required [18] . Moreover, and especially for the case of Sweden, if we look at the daily cases reporting diagram in Figure 18 , it is evident that a weekly consistent pattern with less reported cases during the weekends appears. This is possibly an indication 5 for co-existence of inconsistent reporting that affects the quality of the timeseries we are using.",

Based on our comparisons with one of the most common and simple tools for mathematically modelling infectious diseases (SIR), we have provided evidence that Richards curve has an equivalent modelling capacity while being equivalently simple to SIR, if not simpler. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the use of meta-projections, i.e., histories and the corresponding trends of Richards' model parameters from successive projections, can provide researchers and professionals with insights on assessing the appropriateness of the employed models, effortlessly identify different phases of the disease and in effect decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic's severity and development. A number of different countries with successive projections regarding COVID-19 development till 20.04.2020 have been included and discussed. This discussion naturally brought up the issue of sufficient and reliable data which is an absolute pre-requisite to attain projections which could be potentially useful and meaningful.",

The next parameter value that needs to be estimated is K0, which, when tM0 has been identified and given the fact that v0=1, can be safely assumed to be twice the number of total cases at tM0. Obviously, the lower bound can be set as the number of currently reported cases while the upper bound can be estimated as a multiple of the number of cases at the lowest possible position of the inflection point.The final parameter-value and bounds estimation concerns the growth rate B. Its initial estimation B0is computed by averaging the exhibited growth rates on the exponential part of the trajectory while its bounds are determined by the minimum and maximum growth values calculated during the aforementioned averaging process. This set of initial values and bounds estimation produces sigmoid curves with very low root-mean-square error (RMSE), which are in general agreement with the models produced using the SIR approach; see comparisons in the results section.",

Note that the red diagonal line in the same graph is the y=x line and obviously, points above this line place the turning point in the future while points below it, place the estimated inflection point in the past. When these two lines (inflection point estimation history and y=x) intersect, it signifies an estimation that places the inflection point at the same day the projection was made. If the estimations history crosses the red diagonal line on its way down, and stays below it, the turning point is placed in the past and this signifies the transition to the decreasing growth phase. Obviously, if the inflection point is projected in the future, i.e., the curve is above the red line, the epidemic is in its growing phase.

Some countries, like Kazakhstan seemed temporarily to have passed the turning point but the epidemic underwent a transition phase and now it is clear that the turning point is still in the future.In addition to evaluating each country's state of the pandemic individually, some similarities can be observed in the parameters' history profiles between countries. For example, Greece, Norway and Iran, and at a lesser extent Cyprus share a similar profile; seeFigure 20.
