In this paper, we mainly design the eMicrob, in particular, build up the e-Microbe miniGrid deployed in IRSA, CAS and IME, the Chinese PLA. The architecture is as follows: Firstly we review related grid applications that are motivating widespread interest in Grid concepts within the scientific and engineering communities. Secondly we talk about the key methodologies and strategies involved in the construction of eMicrob. In the third section, the system design of the eMicrob, in particular about the architecture of the eMicrob miniGrid is discussed. Finally, we draw some conclusion in the process of the building of eMicrob and make some discussion about the challenges. It has been proven that the methods based on the Grid technologies are revolutionary and high efficient through the experience of the establishment and deployment of the e-Microbe miniGrid.",

However, we have done some new researches in the epidemiology (science of the public health, http://www.acepideiology2.org/aboutepid/whatis.asp) based on the new emerging technology -Grid computing, integrated with geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), which will establish a virtual organization comprised of scientists and engineers from many different fields and discipline. Grid computing, as a new technology, is mainly concerned with \"coordinated resource sharing and problem solving in dynamic, multi-institutional virtual organizations.\" (Foster et al. 2001) . A principal objective in the development of Grid computing is to make such resources available to users, regardless of their geographical location or institutional affiliation. While this goal is some way from being achieved, we have developed eMicrob miniGrid in the use of Grid tools, which allows us to make progress in the prediction accuracy of epidemiological patterns, epidemiological modeling, risk predictions of infectious diseases etc by combining the geo-information and molecular simulation. Now through the eMicrob project we know that patterns and risk predictions can be made through GIS, by which we can study the dynamics of the epidemiological diseases based on above-mentioned environment factors achieved from remote sensing based on the grid platform. The undergoing eMicrob project benefits from grid and spatial technologies in various ways.",

First, we build up a science team comprising of 3 kinds of technician, i.e. developer of code, epidemiologist and specialist from spatial domains. Second, we build our different database based on the SRB (http://www.npaci.edu/DICE/SRB/) technology. Moreover, we deploy the miniGrid on the platform -HIT-SIP developed by us .now we will expound on it. HIT-SIP (Wang et. al., 2004) Grid platform in Institute of Remote Sensing Applications, Chinese Academy of Science is an advanced High-Throughput Computing Grid testbed using Condor developed by Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Heterogeneous computing nodes include two sets of Linux computers and WIN 2000 professional computers and one set of WIN XP computer provide stable computing power. The Grid pool uses java universally to screen heterogeneous characters. In general, users can use the heterogeneous Grid and share its strong computing power to process remote sensing images with middlewares as if in one supercomputer. Across the HIT-SIP platform, we can process and analyze the remote sensed images, for example, supervised classification and unsupervised classification and retrieval of various environment factors, which will be used in such discipline as biology, public health, and other spatially related disciplines.
