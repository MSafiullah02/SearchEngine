The relationship between medical technology and spending is complex and often conflicting. The impact of technology on costs differs across technologies, in that some (e.g., cancer drugs, invasive medical devices) have significant financial implications, while others are cost-neutral or cost-saving [7]. Medicine in the 21st century is increasingly dependent on technology. Unlike in many other areas, the cost of medical technology is not declining, and its increasing use contributes to spiraling healthcare costs. Many medical professionals equate progress in medicine to the growing use of sophisticated technology, which is often expensive and beyond the reach of the average citizen [8].",

Digital healthcare is a major driver of innovation, growth, and competitiveness. Digital technology is reported to reduce healthcare costs by 7 to 11 percent [9,10]. Cashless (digital) payment savings account for 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) [11]. To the extent that GDP can roughly be assimilated to revenue, and considering an incidence of some 80% of operating costs (EBIT/revenues), the estimated operating cost reduction due to cashless payments is around 0.4%. An international comparison of health prices across countries can improve the private competition for international public\u2013private partnership (PPP) tenders [12].",

The increasing pace of change in healthcare technologies and policies has generated increased interest in the future adaptability of the physical infrastructure that supports health services [17]. Technological investments are often made possible by public\u2013private cooperation within healthcare PPP agreements backed by project finance (PF) patterns. The introduction of health information technologies (HIT) increases organizational performance, including productivity enhancement and cost reductions. HIT can contribute to hospital profitability, for instance, by reducing paper chart pulling and document transportation, reducing medical errors, and potentially lowering medical liability costs as well as decreasing back-office expenses [18,19].

These savings must then be shared with the public player (to avoid undeserved private rents) and returned, as far as possible, to the patients, in the form of lower fees and improved care. Part of the saving should also be reinvested in expensive \u201chard\u201d (nondigital) technology. This should ease capital rationing concerns that represent a significant bottleneck in healthcare investments, fostering long-term socio-economic sustainability. This sequential model will be tested with an empirical case.",

Section 3 describes the methodology, combining the study\u2019s motivation and purpose with its background. The research question concerns an estimate of the impact of the digital savings to soften supply chain bottlenecks. A corollary aspect is represented by the (optimal) public\u2013private\u2013patient sharing of savings with P4P schemes. The methodology also contains an outline of the investigation area and a description of the consequential reasoning that it brings to the empirical case. Section 4 analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks that are part of the study background, and whose softening is an ancillary component of the motivation and purpose of the paper. Section 5 addresses specific solutions to some healthcare bottlenecks, through an analysis of value co-creation patterns based on digital health platforms. Digitalization and networking of key stakeholders will be analyzed as an ideal interactive background for these solutions. Section 6 analyzes the cost\u2013benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. The economic and financial impact of digitalization will be tested with a sensitivity analysis on a sample of healthcare PPP investments. The discussion (Section 7) and the conclusions (Section 8) critically examine and summarize the main findings. Some policy implications (P4P sharing of digital savings; impact of digitalization on PPP contracts) will be analyzed, together with practical recommendations and tips for further research.",

In the first, payers reduce global FfS payments and use the funds to reward hospitals based on how well they perform across process, quality, and efficiency measures.

Eighty-five percent of general medical doctors (81% of specialized doctors) use email to communicate with patients (64% of general doctors and 57% of specialized doctors use WhatsApp). Online booking is used by 11% of patients and 7% pay online. A total of 41% of citizens use wearables, smartwatches, or other devices to monitor their health. Image diagnostics is digitalized in 88% of cases (86% of lab analyses). Digital apps are widely used in radiology (84%), but less in ultrasound (40%), ECG/EEG (33%), or digital pathology apps (7%). The use of mobile applications (m-apps), blogs, or online health searches for information is continuously growing. eProcurement of digital solutions is still a bottleneck due to insufficient awareness of its potential and to legal obstacles. More comprehensive application of digital health in Italy may substantially improve the quality of life of some 24 million people (40% of the population) that suffer from chronic diseases. Italy currently invests in digital healthcare only \u20ac22 per citizen (compared to \u20ac70 per citizen in Denmark; \u20ac60 per citizen in the UK and \u20ac40 per citizen in France).

This template can be easily extended to other international cases, since PPP initiatives like those considered here show consistent similarities. This is due also to European legislation, according to which big EU tenders are open to international competitors that require standard rules. The basic model is therefore easily generalizable to other healthcare PPP investments.

Additionally, the economic and financial plan, exemplified in Table 2 (and with a detail of opex items in Table 3), needs careful personalization, reflecting the nature of heterogeneous business plans.

Digitalization (with its mHealth applications) eases the transformation of (non-acute) inpatients into outpatients or even home patients, as shown in [81], reducing expensive and painful hospitalization rates;The public actor, in the absence of shared public\u2013private benefits, may be tempted to follow alternative ways (for instance, considering traditional procurement or public leasing, where gains are internalized, and not shared with the private partner, albeit the technological expertise of the latter would be less valuable);The sharing of the digital savings should be provided for in the public\u2013private contract, with incentives that accrue to both the counterparts and to their backing stakeholders (the patients behind the public and the banks and suppliers behind the private). These incentives may impact on the availability payment or performance fees, following a P4P approach;The investment pattern typically being long term (envisaging some 3 years of the project and construction, followed by 15\u201325 years of management of the hospital, as shown in the empirical case), timely milestones are helpful for periodic monitoring of the (digitally-improved) performance;If sharing of the digitally driven savings and efficiency gains fairly concerns the main stakeholders (the private investor and her backing banks, the public procurer, and the patients), then there is an incentive to co-create value, igniting a win\u2013win pattern;Part of the saving that accrues to the public player may be set aside to finance less profitable investments (e.g., expensive diagnostic technologies; hospitals in uneasy locations; low-income patients; orphan pathologies, etc.), to the ultimate benefit of neglected patients.New investments covered by digital savings also generate opportunities for private actors, promoting sustainable economic growth. New healthcare projects are often hampered by shrinking budgets [1,2,3]. Savings and value co-creation are therefore crucial for the sponsoring of new initiatives.",
