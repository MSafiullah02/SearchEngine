Thousands of Greek patients with rheumatic diseases are currently treated with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg or 400 mg per day) for months or even years. Millions of people with the respective rheumatic diseases are receiving this drug all over the world. Severe adverse reactions are limited, and only a minor proportion of the patients that have an indication to take the drug had to discontinue it because of adverse reactions (for more information visit https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537086/). We have a long experience with the drug, its safety profile and its efficacy for the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases and co-existing comorbidities, and we are currently treating hundreds of patients in Central Greece with this medication. Having said that, caution must be exercised for over-the-counter use of medications.

It also looks like chloroquine also exerts its anti-viral action by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion,5,11 It also interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV and this may at least in part explain its potent efficacy in treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.5 Chloroquine may also have an anti-thrombotic effect in COVID-19 patients appearing with vasculitides or thrombotic episodes. It may also play an inhibitory role in the cytokine storm phenomenon noted in COVID-19 ARDS through the abrogation of pro-inflammatory cytokine release. It is not clear though what the effect of the drug is on antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses against COVID-19 immunodominant antigens.\nWe suggest the following initiatives:The Greek Health Authorities must secure large amounts of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, sufficient enough to cover the country\u2019s needs before the extreme amplification phase of the pandemic. Very recently, a Greek pharmaceutical company imported a large amount of chloroquine and will provide, for free, 24 million doses to the Greek Health authorities for general hospital needs (\nhttp://www.ekathimerini.com/251072/article/ekathimerini/news/uni-pharmato-produce-offer-free-chloroquine-to-state-for-covid-19-treatment). This is very encouraging.Its use must be restricted to hospitalised patients.Synoptic tables must be drafted from the national Health Authorities summarizing the selected investigational drugs to be consider for clinical use at this moment with information on in vitro/in vivo efficacy, the current therapeutic recommendations for each category of COVID-19 patients, with indications and precautions, and the treatment protocols. An excellent example of such tables is probably that prepared by the Belgium Task Force (Interim clinical guidance for patients suspected of/confirmed with COVID-19 in Belgium [19 March 2020. Version 4]).A public Campaign must be initiated ensuring the Greek public that the drug is available in sufficient amounts to calm public anxiety.Greek Medical Professionals must thoroughly and regularly be informed about its applicability in treating COVID-19 pneumonia through the respective medical societies and professional associations.Meticulous attempts need to be made for as many as possible Greek COVID-19 patients to be included in the SOLIDARITY trial or other pan-European, multi-international initiatives.National clinical trials on the efficacy, safety and antigenicity and anti-viral efficacy of this regimen in Greek patients with COVID-19 must be initiated, as soon as possible.Registries of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases treated with plaquenil, infected or not with COVID-19 must be formulated as soon as possible.Fast-track grant schemes providing support for translational and basic research on the topic must be initiated from National Grant Giving Bodies.A national biobanking facility must be initiated, collecting biomaterial for current or future translational research in Greek COVID-19 patients.\n",
