The production of this fusion polypeptide is achreved via a frameshifting event that leads to the translational avoidance of the TYA termination codon and a shift into the TYB reading phase. This expression strategy is analogous to the production of the gag-pol fusion protein in the retroviruses, gag coding for structural proteins and pol coding for the reverse transcriptase. However, in the case of the retroviruses the gaggpol protein is synthesized via -1 frameshift (74, 75) or readthrough (16) mechanisms. A CaMV ORF IV-ORF V fusion protein has not been detected either in infected plants (7, 17) or in in vitro translation systems (18) . The absence of a fusion polypeptide could be due to the immediate processing of the protein by the proteolytic activity located at the Nterminal part of the ORF V product (79) . Likewise some factors necessary for a +l frameshifting event could be absent in the in vitro translation systems. For this reason, we decided to study the expression strategy of CaMV ORF IV-ORF V in the yeast system. This system is a powerful tool since it was used with success to demonstrate a +l frameshift mechanism for the yeast retrotransposon Ty (73).",

This fragment contains the region necessary for a frameshifting event: ORF IV ends at nucleotide 3670 and ORF V begins at nucleotide 3591. Positive controls for our assay system were provided by 837 0042 fusing (i) CaMV ORFVII in frame with the end of ORF IV, and (ii) the beginning of ORF V in frame with the CaMV ORF III (Fig. 1) . We used this construction because we had antisera raised against the N-terminal extremities of ORF III product (anti-P3 (20) ) and ORF VII product (anti-P7 (21)) and against the C-terminal part of ORF IV product (anti-P4 (7)).

Yeast cells containing pMW701 synthesized a protein of 14 kDa immunodetected by anti-P7 serum (Fig. 2 , slot 1) but not by anti-P4 serum (Fig. 2, slot 3) . This protein corresponds to the native P7 and has already been described (21) . Cells containing pFS450 synthesized a protein of 22 kDa immunodetected by anti-P7 and anti-P4 sera (Fig. 2, slots 2 and 4) . This is slightly greater than the theoretical molecular weight of P7-P4 (18.5 kDa). It is not surprising since P7 and P4 are known to have apparent molecular weights on SDS-PAGE greater than their theoretical molecular weights (18, 21) . As our hybrid protein was detected by sera raised against the N-terminal extremity of P7 and the C-ter-minal part of P4 we can conclude that ORF VII is fused in frame with the end of ORF IV. To verify this, the integrity of the ORF V-ORF III junction was confirmed by DNA sequencing (data not shown).",

Yeast proteins were also tested with the anti-P3 serum and no protein was immunodetected (data not shown). The background of the aspecific immunoreactions was reduced by immunoabsorbing all the tested antisera against a mixture of bacteria and yeast cells. Except for the 22-and 50-kDa proteins no other proteins were detected (result not shown). From these re- sults, we conclude that the 50-kDa polypeptide is probably a dimeric form of P7-P4.
