Previous data from pandemic influenza and early modelling work from Imperial College suggest that the cancer and chemotherapy immunosuppression are risk factors for death [5, 6] . Lei et al. [7] reported increased surgical risks, with a 21% operative mortality of 34 patients who acquired COVID after elective surgery for a range of conditions. Minimising hospital visits is crucial, with some studies indicating over 40% of COVID-positive patients contracted it in hospital and reporting a higher incidence in those attending a cancer centre than the general population [8, 9] .",

Although LCRT is the most established treatment in this group, there is no level 1 evidence that LCRT is superior to SCRT in reducing local recurrences and is not an 'under treatment'. Should a patient acquire COVID during LCRT, there is the risk of the infection itself but also the risk of compromised radiotherapy treatment due to treatment gaps. As such, LCRT should only be considered as an option for young, fit patients without comorbidities with appropriate consent and isolation advice. We acknowledge the right decision for each patient will depend on the patient and their risk factors, the tumour and the situation in the department at the time. Post-treatment imaging will depend on availability; however, imaging can identify patients in whom a further delay can be safely considered. Surgery should proceed if appropriate, as and when it is possible safely.",
