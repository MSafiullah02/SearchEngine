            "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a progressive degenerative disorder of the hip characterized by subchondral bone microfractures and subsequent collapse of the femoral head, eventually leading to dysfunction of the hip joint 1. ONFH poses a huge socioeconomic burden, usually affecting young to middle aged individuals, with ~67% of asymptomatic patients rapidly progressing to symptomatic stages and thus requiring total hip arthroplasties (THA) 2. The exact aetiology of ONFH is unclear, however, steroid administration is an established risk factor, which accounts for ~51% of all reported ONFH cases 3. For example, in patients who received corticosteroid treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it was reported that an increase of corticosteroids to 10 mg/d correlated with a 3.6 % increase in the rate of osteonecrosis, with daily doses >40 mg predisposing patients to ONFH 4. Consistently, patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can also develop ONFH and progress into late stage following steroid administration 5. The other known contributors include alcohol abuse, tobacco use, coagulation abnormalities, chemotherapy, genetic factors, and idiopathic cause 3, 6, 7.",

            "text": "The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying steroid-induced ONFH are not fully understood. Recent studies suggest that the onset of ONFH is initiated by impaired microcirculation and necrosis of osteocytes, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detecting pools of edema 1, 8, but without noticeable changes in subchondral bone microstructure, as assessed by computed tomography (CT). Following bone necrosis, a repair process ensues whereby osteoclast-mediated bone resorption surpasses bone formation by osteoblasts, leading to net loss of subchondral trabecular bone 9. As the ONFH progresses, the loss of bone and altered microarchitecture compromises the integrity of the femoral head resulting in deformity and high vulnerability of collapse 8. It is widely accepted that excessive osteoclast activity during the regenerative phase, rather than during the necrosis of cells and tissue, directly contributes to the loss of bone integrity and ensuing subchondral bone fracture 8-11. This contribution is further supported by studies showing that anti-resorptive agents could effectively reduce the risk of femoral head collapse at early-stage ONFH when compared with placebo treatment 12-14.",

            "text": "A better understanding of the activation of osteoclasts during repair process is therefore critical in order to develop effective treatments to preserve the integrity of hip joint prior to femoral head deformation and collapse. Accumulated evidence indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in osteoclast formation and function by modulating receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL)-induced signalling 15-17. Our previous work has demonstrated that ROS levels are increased during estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis in mice, and that antioxidant agents are effective in inhibiting osteoclast activity and thus preventing bone loss 18. ROS have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of ONFH, causing damage to blood vessels and osteoblastic cell lineages 19-21. However, the underlying mechanisms by which ROS levels change and cause the activation of the osteoclasts in the context of steroid-induced ONFH remain poorly understood. Our study revealed that the high oxidative stress following steroid administration may result from decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes, eventually leading to osteoclast hyperactivity and subsequently ONFH progression.",

Peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis was performed periodically. The patient reported a complaint of left hip joint pain and was then diagnosed with ONFH in 2011. ONFH was gradually progressed to a late stage which required a THA. Representative anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral radiographs of the pelvis of this patient demonstrated a crescentic lucency in the subchondral area of left femoral head (crescent sign) (Figure 1A), suggesting the separation of subchondral bone from the overlying cartilage due to collapse of the femoral head. Joint space narrowing with acetabular involvement was also clearly delineated in Figure 1A, based on which the patient was diagnosed as stage IV according to Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) staging system 24. Furthermore, MRI indicated the presence of a large-sized osteonecrotic lesion of the left femoral head, which presented as a low signal intensity area on T1-weighted image and a high signal on T2-weighted image (Figure 1B). The sequentially sliced macroscopic sections of the femoral head specimens clearly showed altered femoral head shape and osteonecrotic bone within the subchondral area (Figure 1C).",

H&E staining of decalcified femoral head sections showed the uniform absence of osteocytes within lacunae, indicative of osteonecrosis in the necrotic region (Figure 2A). TRAP staining revealed that the necrotic bone tissues were widely circumscribed by osteoclasts (Figure 2A). The number of osteoclasts in the necrotic region was significantly higher than that in the healthy region (Figure 2B). It is also notable that there was an increase of fat tissue accumulation in the necrotic region as compared with the healthy region (Figure 2A). To assess for osteoclast activity and explore its relationship with oxidative stress, qPCR was performed to compare the difference of associated gene expression between healthy region and necrotic region (Figure 2C). Osteoclast-specific genes, including CTSK and ACP5, were robustly up-regulated in the necrotic region compared with those in the healthy region. The ratio of TNFSF11 (encoding RANKL)/TNFRSF11B (encoding OPG) was also increased in the necrotic regions. In contrast, genes encoding anti-oxidant enzymes including CAT (encoding catalase), NQO1 (encoding NAD[P]H quinone dehydrogenase 1), and HMOX1 (encoding heme oxygenase 1 [HO-1]), were notably down-regulated in the necrotic bone. Furthermore, the western blot analyses of the osteoclast-related proteins (RANKL and cathepsin K) and antioxidant enzymes including catalase, \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCSc), and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) further corroborated the mRNA findings, showing similar trends at the protein level (Figure 2D). The consistent expression trends of antioxidant enzymes and osteoclast markers were also noted in the other two cases. Together, these findings demonstrate that enhanced osteoclast activity is a pathological feature associated with ONFH which may, in part, due to the dysregulation of antioxidant enzymes and subsequent high oxidative stress.",

Quantification of the DHE fluorescence intensity indicated a higher oxidative stress in the rat femoral head following the steroid administration (Figure 5C). Western blot assay of the femoral head tissues further indicated that the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes such as HO-1, catalase, and SOD1 were significantly down-regulated in the model group (Figure 5D). In contrast, the expression of the mature osteoclast marker cathepsin K was upregulated in the ONFH model group (Figure 5D). In addition, the expression of RANKL was also increased (Figure 5D).

ONFH is a progressive bone disorder which typically results in the collapse of the femoral head at end stage. The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying steroid-induced osteonecrosis remain controversial. Recent studies indicate that increased osteoclast number and activity are responsible for the femoral head bone loss and subsequent failure 8, 10, 11. Given the increasing number of studies illustrating a role promising or ROS in promoting osteoclast formation and resorption, we sought to elucidate whether alterations of ROS level and osteoclasts lead to the pathogenesis of ONFH following the use of steroids. In the present study, ROS-related enzymes and osteoclasts were detected in both patients' ONFH specimens and rodent models mimicking ONFH. Specimens of femoral head were obtained from late-stage patients with progressive collapse of femoral head and required THA. Antioxidant enzymes and osteoclasts were then compared between healthy and necrotic regions. Steroid-induced ONFH rat models were then established to further assess the role of ROS and osteoclasts that played in this bone disorder.",

ROS are known to play a pivotal role in aging and degenerative diseases 25, 26. The deleterious effects of ROS result from the alternations to the integrity of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, which can lead to cell apoptosis or necrosis 27. Accumulating studies have suggested that bone pathophysiology is closely related with redox balance and ROS are key modulators of bone cell functions 28. High oxidative stress is thought to be associated with the development of various bone disorders, including osteoporosis 29, 30, bone tumours 31, diabetic osteopenia 32, rheumatoid arthritis 33, and ankylosing spondylitis 34. Recent evidence also indicated that ROS are involved in the pathogenesis of steroid-induced ONFH 20, 21, 35 and that approaches inhibiting oxidative stress exert potential therapeutic effects on ONFH 35-37. To validate this, a ROS probe (DHE) was administrated on the rats prior to sacrifice, which is distributed via the circulation enabling the direct visualization of ROS in tissues as we previously described 18. Not surprisingly, the ROS fluorescence intensity in the microenvironment of subchondral area in femoral head was dramatically enhanced following steroid treatment. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that the ROS levels have been directly visualized in the femoral head ex vivo. However, we are unable to identify the specific source of ROS, which may also be partly contributed by the altered conditions of osteocytes and fat tissues.",

The mechanism underlying the steroid-induced oxidative stress in the femoral head 39 remains unclear, but is thought that the administration of steroid leads to the downregulation of cytoprotective enzymes and subsequently causes redox failure 40, 41. Indeed, our results confirmed that the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, \u03b3-GCSc, and SOD1) were significantly altered in the necrotic area of patients' femoral head relative to the healthy area, suggesting the existence of redox failure and the high level of ROS in the necrotic area. SOD plays a major role in cellular redox by reducing superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which is less unstable 38. Catalase then converts H2O2 into oxygen and water, thereby protecting the cells from ROS damage 42. Furthermore, in addition to high ROS signalling in the femoral head, rats received steroids injection also showed decreased expressions of antioxidant enzymes including HO-1, catalase, and SOD1. A previous study demonstrated that the steroid administration may affect the antioxidant enzymes site-specifically, which was featured by an increased expression level of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and catalase in liver, kidney, and heart as compared with humerus and femur 40. Following the use of steroid, the oxidation-reduction homeostasis in bone is compromised and therefore the bone was thought to be more susceptible to oxidative stress. These findings collectively suggest that the compromised expressions of antioxidant enzymes are, at least partly, responsible for the oxidative stress due to steroid administration.",

            "text": "The current understanding of the hazards of ROS is that oxidative stress may lead to pathological conditions, including the elevated vascular permeability 43 as well as DNA oxidation injuries 39 which cause cell apoptosis or necrosis 37. However, whether ROS enhance the osteoclast activity during the pathogenesis of ONFH has not been previously reported. ROS can support the activation of RANKL-induced signalling, which is essential for osteoclast formation and resorptive activity 15, 18, 44. The exact molecules or proteins that ROS target remain unclear, but RANKL-induced downstream events such as MAPK 15 and NF-\u03baB signaling 45 appear to be involved. Our results demonstrate that the reduced antioxidant enzymes in the necrotic area are accompanied by the augmented osteoclast-related markers, such as cathepsin K, which were also supported by the TRAP staining indicating that osteoclasts activity is localized to the necrotic area. However, more clinical specimens as well as the investigation of mechanisms underlying the declined expression of the antioxidant enzymes are still needed in further study. Given the increased accumulation of fat tissue in the necrotic region, the loss of bone structure integrity could also be partly due to the impaired osteoblast differentiation. The corticosteroid treatment could increase adipogenesis by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), but decrease osteogenesis, which was well documented previously 36, 46, 47. Consistent with these human specimens, we found that osteoclast numbers were elevated in rat models of steroid-induced ONFH, which ultimately resulted in decreased femoral trabecular bone volume as assessed by \u03bcCT (BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Sp). Relative to the control group, rats of the ONFH group also showed structurally disorganized bone as examined by the measurement of anisotropy. These results indicate that oxidative stress is closely related with the osteoclast activity and thus may coincide with the rapid progression of ONFH.",

            "text": "However, there are also some limitations in this study. Firstly, an anti-ROS group was not included in this study. It was previously indicated that anti-oxidative stress treatments indeed prevent or alleviate steroid-induced ONFH by affecting blood vessel, osteocytes, and adipose tissues 35, 36, 48-50, but with the lack of data on the role of osteoclasts. Osteoclast acts as a major contributor to the collapse of femoral head and the agents like bisphosphonates were also shown to have beneficial effects on ONFH 13. Herein, anti-ROS agents may also exhibit therapeutic effects by inhibiting excessive osteoclasts in steroid-induced ONFH, which needs to be further determined. Secondly, the outcomes or pathogenesis of steroid-induced ONFH in animals of different species 51 or/and in human may be variable. The human samples were collected from late-stage ONFH, while the animal models used in this study were more likely to be at early stage which may not coincide with the results on clinical perspective. Currently, rat models are still considered as desirable and suitable preclinical models to study molecular mechanisms of metabolic diseases 46. In this study, we proposed that ROS may activate osteoclasts and subsequently lead to the progression of ONFH. To address this hypothesis, early-stage rat ONFH seems well-represent the steroid-induced alterations of ROS and osteoclasts before the femoral head collapse. On the other hand, given the hard access to the human specimens at early stage, more advanced animal models which can mimic the late-stage ONFH are still required to be developed in the future.",

Oxidative injuries usually present shortly following steroid administration at the very early-stage ONFH 39, 48, and excessive osteoclast activity is also believed to be a contributor for femoral head collapse. This provides rationale that antioxidant therapy may be a promising alternative to prevent the progression or collapse of steroid-induced ONFH by suppressing ROS level and thus inhibiting osteoclasts.",
