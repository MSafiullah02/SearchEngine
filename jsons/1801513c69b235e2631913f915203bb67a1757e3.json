Moreover, in recent decades immunotherapy has become the mainstream therapy, which highlights the tremendous potential of immune response mediators, including vaccines for prevention and treatment of various forms of cancer. However, despite the tremendous advances in microbiology and immunology, there are several vaccine preventable diseases which still lack effective vaccines. Classically, weakened forms (attenuated) of pathogenic microbes were used as vaccines. Although the attenuated microbes induce effective immune response, a significant risk of reversion to pathogenic forms remains.

These properties of live-attenuated microbes are being harnessed to make vaccines against several infectious and noninfectious diseases. In this regard, I have described the desired features of live-attenuated bacterial vectors and the mechanisms of immune responses manifested by live-attenuated bacterial vectors.

PAMPs, which are recognized by components of the innate immune system including Tolllike receptors (TLRs), facilitate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and recruitment of antigen-presenting cells ( Fig. 2.2) .

Since birth, mucosal surfaces of the human body are constantly challenged with agents of the external environment that are either completely harmless (food ingredients and nonpathogenic microbes) or pathogenic (pathogenic microbes). Thus, in order to restrict pathogenic insults at mucosal surfaces, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) are organized. In fact, MALT constitutes the largest immune system of the human body.

The signaling initiated by this interaction leads to the activation of antigenpresenting cells. Activated antigen-presenting cells express costimulatory molecules CD80, CD86, and CD40 as well as enhance expression of MHC-II. Costimulatory molecules are required to deliver the essential second signal for T-cell activation, while the first signal is received via TCR-MHC-peptide interaction. Importantly, CCR7 expressed by activated APCs help migration to draining lymph node. Moreover, the type of cytokines directs the fate of T-cell polarization to Th1, Th2, or TH17. Cytosolic delivery of antigens gives rise to CTL response vaginal, and rectal. Upon oral administration, antigens travel through the gastrointestinal tract and reach the mucosal inductive sites called Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are lined with specialized epithelial cells called M cells which serve as a point of entry into the lamina propria. In the lamina propria, dendritic cells take up the antigens and migrate to the draining lymph nodes where they present the antigens to T cells. A specialized feature of dendritic cells from Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes is that they induce gut-homing receptors \u03b14/\u03b27 and CCR9 on T and B cells. This feature is not found in the dendritic cells from cervical lymph nodes and spleen. Thereby, T and B cells primed at the mucosal sites are destined to migrate to mucosal tissues (Pasetti et al. 2011) (Fig. 2.3 ).

The classic example is BCG, where Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin, by culturing a virulent strain of M. bovis for more than 230 serial passages in vitro (between 1908 and 1921) , generated the attenuated strain BCG. BCG is still the only vaccine available for prevention against tuberculosis. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that BCG lack multiple virulence factors associated with M. bovis (Zheng et al. 2015) . Similarly, the search for vaccines against typhoid fever led to the generation of attenuated live vaccine strains of Salmonella. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (ST) strain Ty21a (ST-Ty21a) was generated by chemical mutagenesis of wild-type ST strain Ty2. The ST-Ty21a is considerably attenuated which is now licensed for humans use as an oral vaccine (Wang et al. 2001 ). However, the strain exhibits low immunogenicity, as 3-4 doses are required to achieve adequate levels of protection. With the advances in microbial genetics and genetic engineering techniques, it has now become routine to identify and inactivate virulence genes. Interestingly, various auxotrophic mutant Salmonella strains, which lack the ability to synthesize aromatic amino acids, were found to be avirulent (Hoiseth and Stocker 1981) . It is known that in Salmonella, the gene products of aroA, aroC, and aroD are required for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, as well as several essential vitamins. Hoiseth and Stocker note that these factors are not found in mammalian hosts in sufficient amount; thus Salmonella aroA mutants cannot proliferate in mammalian hosts (Hoiseth and Stocker 1981) . Harnessing this knowledge, various Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (ST) or Typhimurium (STm) have been created, with mutations in aroA (Dalla Pozza et al. 1998; Roberts et al. 2000; Arnold et al. 2004) , aroC (Khan et al. 2003; Capozzo et al. 2004) , aroD (Capozzo et al. 2004; Sevil Dom\u00e8nech et al. 2008) , or aroAD (Strugnell et al. 1992; Roberts et al. 2000) . Notably, the ST strain CVD908 which carries aroC and aroD mutations exhibits residual virulence in humans (Wang et al. 2001) , while other investigators have also targeted genes in nucleotide biosynthesis pathways for creating attenuated Salmonella. Wang et al. engineered a Salmonella strain with a mutation in guaBA operon, which interferes in the guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. The resultant strain, called CVD 915, exhibits safety profile comparable to that of the typhoid vaccine strain ST-Ty21a. Importantly, ST-Ty21a, CVD-908-htrA (harboring mutations at aroC, aroD, and htrA), and CVD 915 all exhibit a high level of immunogenicity (Wang et al. 2001) . Not surprisingly, ST strains with guaBA mutations have been widely utilized as LABV (Pasetti et al. 1999 (Pasetti et al. , 2000 Wang et al. 2001) . Another approach of attenuation of Salmonella is to introduce mutations in cya (adenylate cyclase) and crp (cyclic AMP) receptor genes. These proteins are transcriptional regulators of many important genes. Although cAMP is found in mammalian cells, their concentrations in gastrointestinal tissues are below the requirement of Salmonella. Thus cya and crp mutants show reduced virulence (Tacket et al. 1992; Chen and Schifferli 2003; Wyszy\u0144ska et al. 2004; Ferreira Oliveira et al. 2012) . Mutations in the two-component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ, which controls more than 40 virulence genes involved in resistance to antimicrobial peptides, nutrient scavenging, and lipid A modifications, significantly decrease Salmonella virulence (Raupach and Kaufmann 2001) . Salmonella strains with PhoP/PhoQ mutations have been used in a number of studies as LABV (Angelakopoulos and Hohmann 2000; Kotton et al. 2006; Galen et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2013) . RpoS is an alternate sigma factor that regulates resistance under stress induced during gastrointestinal infection such as pH, nutrient starvation, change in osmolarity, and temperature. ST-Ty21a contains multiple mutations including rpoS (Wang et al. 2001) . SsaV is a component of Salmonella type III secretion system, which is required for secretion of SPI-2 genes (essential for growth in macrophages). The ST strain ZH9 which contains aroC and ssaV mutations is highly attenuated and immunogenic in humans (Hindle et al. 2002) . Tacket et al. generated mutations in htrA gene, which encodes a heat shock protein. The resultant strain was avirulent because of reduced ability to survive and replicate in host tissues (Tacket et al. 2000) . HtrA mutant Salmonella strains have been used in multiple studies as LABVs (Galen et al. 1999; Roberts et al. 2000; Pasetti et al. 2002; Capozzo et al. 2004; Fraillery et al. 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 362, "text": "(between 1908 and 1921)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 582, "end": 601, "text": "(Zheng et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF182"}, {"start": 959, "end": 976, "text": "(Wang et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 1391, "end": 1417, "text": "(Hoiseth and Stocker 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1784, "text": "(Hoiseth and Stocker 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1949, "text": "Pozza et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1970, "text": "Roberts et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1971, "end": 1990, "text": "Arnold et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2016, "text": "(Khan et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2037, "text": "Capozzo et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2045, "end": 2066, "text": "(Capozzo et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2067, "end": 2094, "text": "Sevil Dom\u00e8nech et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 2106, "end": 2129, "text": "(Strugnell et al. 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2150, "text": "Roberts et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 2259, "end": 2277, "text": "(Wang et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 2795, "end": 2813, "text": "(Wang et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 2900, "end": 2920, "text": "(Pasetti et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 2921, "end": 2943, "text": "(Pasetti et al. , 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 2944, "end": 2961, "text": "Wang et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 3352, "end": 3372, "text": "(Tacket et al. 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 3373, "end": 3398, "text": "Chen and Schifferli 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3399, "end": 3421, "text": "Wyszy\u0144ska et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 3422, "end": 3452, "text": "Ferreira Oliveira et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3701, "end": 3728, "text": "(Raupach and Kaufmann 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 3821, "end": 3854, "text": "(Angelakopoulos and Hohmann 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3855, "end": 3874, "text": "Kotton et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 3875, "end": 3893, "text": "Galen et al. 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3894, "end": 3911, "text": "Wang et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF168"}, {"start": 4153, "end": 4171, "text": "(Wang et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF164"}, {"start": 4425, "end": 4445, "text": "(Hindle et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 4635, "end": 4655, "text": "(Tacket et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 4733, "end": 4752, "text": "(Galen et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 4753, "end": 4773, "text": "Roberts et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 4774, "end": 4794, "text": "Pasetti et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 4795, "end": 4815, "text": "Capozzo et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 4816, "end": 4838, "text": "Fraillery et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Attenuation"}, {"text": "Similarly, for attenuation of Lm, multiple virulence factors have been targeted. ActA which encodes for a surface protein required for actin polymerization in host cells and helps in intracellular migration has been a prominent target for Lm attenuation. Together with the mutation in internalin B (inlB), the actA mutation renders Lm unable to infect hepatocytes; thus these strains are highly attenuated . Phospholipase-C B (PlcB) is required for efficient escape from phagosomal vacuoles. PlcB mutants are thus attenuated due to defect in escape from secondary vacuoles (Peters et al. 2003; Starks et al. 2004; Stevens et al. 2004; Johnson et al. 2011; Jia et al. 2012; Liang et al. 2014) .

The double mutant of Lm requires D-alanine for cell wall biosynthesis and is highly attenuated.

Plasmids are extrachromosomal circular DNA, which are introduced into bacteria by a process called transformation. Generally, bacteria maintain the plasmids utilizing antibiotic resistance mechanism. During in vitro growth, antibiotic selection pressure ensures stable plasmid maintenance; however, in the in vivo conditions, the lack of antibiotic selection pressure plasmid-less bacteria outgrows plasmid-bearing bacteria. Moreover, the use of antibiotic markers are also discouraged, due to the risk of horizontal gene transfer to other microbes with pathogenic potential (Lin et al. 2015; Mignon et al. 2015) . Novel antibiotic-free approaches of plasmid maintenance have been devised to mitigate these concerns. One such approach, known as the balanced lethal system, utilizes mutation in an essential gene in the bacterial chromosome, while the plasmid carries the functional copy of the same gene, thereby ensuring its maintenance by the bacteria (Fig. 2 .1). Galen et al. generated a balanced lethal system for STm based on mutation in asd gene. Asd encodes aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme required in the biosynthesis pathway of DAP (diaminopimelic acid), which is an essential component of bacterial cell wall. DAP is needed for growth and maintenance of asd mutants. A copy of asd gene is inserted into the plasmid; thus asd-deficient bacteria are forced to maintain the plasmid in order to survive in DAP-deprived conditions, such as in the mammalian tissues. The resultant Salmonella typhimurium (STm)-based balanced lethal system exhibits high degree of plasmid stability. This system also exhibits stable expression of the associated heterologous genes (Gal\u00e1n et al. 1990 ). Balanced lethal system has been most widely used in various LABVs including ST (Tacket et al. 1997) , STm (Kang et al. 2002) , and S. flexneri (Zheng et al. 2005) .

Salmonella infect via orogastric route and enter the intestinal lamina propria by transcytosis via M cells, which are present in the mucosal inductive sites (Peyer's patches). In the lamina propria, Salmonella is taken up by various phagocytes including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The infected phagocytes then carry Salmonella to various organs including the liver and spleen via blood or to the mesenteric lymph nodes via lymph. The virulence factors, clustered in Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI-1 and SPI-2), facilitate invasion, survival, and proliferation in the intracellular spaces of macrophages (Pham and McSorley 2015) . Salmonella possess a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including lipoprotein, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin (FliC), and CpG. These PAMPs are recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including TLR 2(1/6) (lipoproteins), TLR4 (LPS), TLR 5 (FliC), or TLR9 (CpG). Activation of these PRRs leads to the expression and secretion of cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, IL8, IL12, IL-18, and IL-23 (Broz et al. 2012 ). These pro-inflammatory factors recruit neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. On the other hand, upon interaction with Salmonella LPS and flagellin, dendritic cells increase the expression of CCR7, CD80, CD86, and CD40. These mature dendritic cells with enhanced capability to process and present antigens can migrate to T-cell areas and initiate adaptive immune responses to cognate antigens. Studies suggest that Salmonella induces humoral as well as CD4 + -, CD8 + -, and Th17-dependent cellmediated immune responses (Pham and McSorley 2015 (Angelakopoulos and Hohmann 2000) , L. monocytogenes (Igwe et al. 2002) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Bumann et al. 2010) , Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Yersinia pestis . While antigen-specific Th1 responses are generated against some parasitic pathogens including Leishmania mexicana (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 1998) , Schistosoma japonicum (Chen et al. 2011) , and Taenia solium (Ding et al. 2013) , mucosal IgG and IgA are generated against Giardia lamblia (Abdul-Wahid and Faubert 2007) and Cryptosporidium parvum (Benitez et al. 2009 ) by ST-and STm-based LABVs carrying related antigens. Besides Salmonella, Listeria is the most extensively studied bacteria as LABV. Similar to Salmonella, Listeria infection begins with orogastric infection. Lm moves across gastrointestinal epithelial barrier by first attaching to and invading epithelial cells. Adhesion and internalization require Lm protein Ami and internalin A (inlA), respectively. Once in the lamina propria Lm rapidly spreads systemically. Lm primarily targets liver with the help of fibronectin binding protein (FbpA). FbpA recognizes fibronectin on the surface of hepatocytes, and at this point another molecule, called internalin (inlB), facilitates Lm internalization. On the other hand, phagocytes specifically macrophages and monocytes recognize lipoteichoic acid via scavenger receptors. After the phagocytosis Lm escapes phagocytic vesicles by synergistic activities of listeriolysin O (LLO) and two phospholipase C (PlcA and PlcB). Another virulence factor is ActA, which has actin polymerization activity and helps Lm migrate from cell to cell (Liang et al. 2014) . Lm expresses various TLR agonists including peptidoglycan, flagellin, and bacterial DNA, which induces pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL1\u03b2, and IL12. Lm-induced cell death results in secretion of IL6, which helps in recruitment of neutrophils. IL12 helps in induction of IFN\u03b3 by NK cells and CD8 + T cells. Lm can also induce type-I IFNs (IFN\u03b1and IFN\u03b2), which is desirable as antiviral immunity. Evidences suggest that Lm induces both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell-mediated immune response (Zenewicz and Shen 2007; Liang et al. 2014) . Lm-carrying viral antigens such as HIV/SIV-gag (Frankel et al. 1995; Friedman et al. 2000; Im et al. 2013) , HPV-E7 (Jia et al. 2012) , and LCMV-NP118-126 (Tvinnereim et al. 2002) induces CTL immune response. Lm-based LABV also induces neutralizing antibody against HIV-gp160 . However, there are limited reports on Lm as LABV against bacterial and parasitic pathogens. In one study, Lm-carrying Coxiella burnetii antigen T4SS (epitopes) induced CD8 + T-cell immune response (Xiong et al. 2017) . In another study Lm-carrying Francisella tularensis antigen IglC induced IFN\u03b3 producing CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell-mediated immune response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 747, "end": 771, "text": "(Pham and McSorley 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1225, "text": "(Broz et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1780, "text": "(Pham and McSorley 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1814, "text": "(Angelakopoulos and Hohmann 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1852, "text": "(Igwe et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1878, "end": 1898, "text": "(Bumann et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2064, "end": 2086, "text": "(Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2129, "text": "(Chen et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2150, "end": 2168, "text": "(Ding et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2229, "end": 2259, "text": "(Abdul-Wahid and Faubert 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2307, "text": "(Benitez et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3388, "end": 3407, "text": "(Liang et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 3911, "end": 3935, "text": "(Zenewicz and Shen 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 3936, "end": 3954, "text": "Liang et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 4004, "end": 4025, "text": "(Frankel et al. 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 4026, "end": 4047, "text": "Friedman et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 4048, "end": 4063, "text": "Im et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 4073, "end": 4090, "text": "(Jia et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 4112, "end": 4136, "text": "(Tvinnereim et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF160"}, {"start": 4432, "end": 4451, "text": "(Xiong et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immune Mechanisms of Vaccines Delivered by Live-Attenuated Bacterial Vectors"}, {"text": "BCG, an attenuated M. bovis, has also exhibited potential as LABV.

S. flexneri invasion causes activation of innate immune system and release of a variety of cytokines including IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL6, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-8 (Fernandez and Sansonetti 2003; Jennison and Verma 2004) .

Nevertheless, the mechanism of immune response in response to B. subtilis delivered antigens is not fully understood. Antigens delivered by B. subtilis have been shown to induce humoral as well as Th1-mediated immune response (Cutting et al. 2009 ). B. subtilis has been used as LABV for various bacterial and parasitic pathogens including pathogenic E. coli, H. pylori, Mtb, Clonorchis sinensis, and S. japonicum. B. subtilis induces systemic IgG (Amuguni and Tzipori 2012; Zhou et al. 2015) , mucosal IgA (Amuguni and Tzipori 2012; Zhou et al. 2015) , and Th1/Th17 (Sibley et al. 2014; Stasilojc et al. 2015) immune response against cognate antigens. The lactic acid bacteria are among the microbes, which occur physiologically in animal digestive tracts and like other natural microflora through their metabolites and interaction with macrophages can stimulate cytokine production.

An attractive feature of DNA vaccine is that it can induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response. While antibodies alone can protect against many pathogens and toxins, cell-mediated immunity is required for protection against intracellular pathogens and cancer. The DNA vaccines in the form of eukaryotic expression plasmids are delivered either by intramuscular injection of naked DNA, intradermal bombardment using DNA coated on gold particles with help of a gene gun, or electroporation following needle injection. However, most of these methods induce only moderate levels of protection in animal models and fail to show efficacy in clinical trials (Schoen et al. 2004 ). In recent years many bacterial vectors have been utilized to deliver plasmids into the host cells (Schoen et al. 2004 ). As many attenuated strains are being developed for delivery of vaccine antigens, similar strains can also be utilized to deliver plasmids as DNA vaccines. Attenuated strains of gut pathogens including ST, STm, or L. monocytogenes are of particular importance, as they colonize and infect mucosal epithelial cells. As discussed above, Listeria infection begins at gastrointestinal tract, and after invasion through intestinal mucosa, Listeria migrate through blood vessels and lymph to other organs. Listeria can infect a wide array of cell types including intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Listeria escape phagocytic vesicles and multiply in cytosol where they release the plasmids. Listeriolysin O helps Listeria lyse and escapes the phagosomal vacuoles (Liang et al. 2014 ). Miki et al. engineered a self-destructing Lm-based vaccine delivering a eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding Mtb antigens Ag85a/Ag85b and MPB/ MPT51.

However, through unknown mechanisms, they can release plasmid DNA into the cytosol (Schoen et al. 2004) . Salmonella strains expressing listeriolysin O have been shown to escape the phagosome vesicles to the cytosol, thus making gene transfer by Salmonella more efficient (Schoen et al. 2004 ).

To circumvent this problem various approaches have been devised. One such approach takes advantage of phage lysin to disintegrate \u2206aroA-Lm after reaching host cell cytosol. The inclusion of phage lysin significantly improved bactofection (bacteria-mediated delivery of plasmid DNA into mammalian cells) efficiency in phagocytic as well as non-phagocytic cells (Pilgrim et al. 2003) . Recently, Kong et al. developed a universal DNA vaccine delivery platform, which includes several modalities for enhanced delivery and immune response to cognate antigens. The attenuated STm includes the capability to escape the phagosomal compartment to the cytosol of the host cells, before phagolysosomal degradation (Kong et al. 2012) . SifA proteins direct Salmonella-induced filament formation when Salmonella is contained in the endosomal vacuoles, and the deletion of sifA gene results in the release of Salmonella into the cytosol. Hence, mutation of sifA gene in Salmonella plasmid carriers allowed successful transfer of plasmid DNA into the cytosol of the host cells (Kong et al. 2012) . Kong et al. also incorporated elements that guide the plasmid into the nucleus. Transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB and AP2 bind to plasmids carrying NF-\u03baB and AP2 binding sequences and transport them to the nucleus where the desired antigens are transcribed (Kong et al. 2012) . Salmonella induces apoptosis/pyroptosis in infected cells that diminishes the overall transfection efficiency. Deletion of tlpA and sseL genes significantly reduces apoptosis in host cells (Kong et al. 2012) . Moreover, Salmonella degradation is delayed due to the regulated expression of the Salmonella lysis program. This allows a limited number of replication and invasiveness, thereby ensuring optimal delivery of plasmids.

Coley, for the first time observed regression of malignant tumor in one of his patients after a bacterial infection. Coley went on to develop the first bacterial therapy against cancer using killed gram-positive bacteria streptococci and a gram-negative bacteria Serratia marcescens. This mixture called \"Coley's toxins\" when injected into patients suffering from various forms of cancer resulted in partial to complete regression. In cases of soft tissue sarcoma, long-term disease-free survival was achieved in approximately 50% of the patients. Nevertheless, despite the remarkable success of \"Coley's toxins,\" with the advent of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this line of investigation was prematurely abandoned (Bickels et al. 2002) . However, in recent years this approach is regaining attention. In fact, BCG is currently being used as immunotherapy for bladder cancer and exhibits superiority over epirubicin and IFN\u03b12b, mitomycin, and epirubicin alone (Fuge et al. 2015) . Since the first report of BCG's use in cancer treatment in 1936, preclinical and clinical investigations of BCG have also been reported for other forms of cancer. Mice preimmunized with BCG exhibited slower tumor growth compared to control (Zheng et al. 2015 (Zheng et al. 2015) . Bacteria, specifically anaerobes, exhibit natural tropism toward solid tumors. This phenomenon, although poorly understood, is theorized that certain characteristics of tumor microenvironment facilitate this phenomenon. The deeper pockets of tumors, which are devoid of new blood vessels, are poorly oxygenated and show limited accessibility to chemotherapeutic drugs (Lee 2012; Lin et al. 2015) .

Various tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) have been targeted for therapeutic vaccines using LABV as delivery vehicles. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is secreted by prostate epithelial cells and is overexpressed in malignant prostate cells. Attenuated Lm expressing PSA (Lm-LLO-PSA) antigen was tested as therapeutic vaccine in mouse tumor models expressing human PSA. Immunization with Lm-LLO-PSA completely regressed tumors in five out of eight mice and induced PSA-specific cellular immune response. Immunization of Lm-LLO-PSA significantly increased infiltration of PSA-specific CD8 + T cells in tumors and decrease in CD4/CD25/FoxP3 + T reg cells (Wallecha et al. 2009 ). HER2/neu is overexpressed in about 25-30% of breast cancers and is a potential target for immunotherapy. Shahabi et al. engineered an Lm-based vaccine incorporating HER2/neu as antigen (ADXS31-1642). ADXS31-164 elicited HER2specific CD8 + T cells. The vaccine caused a significant delay in the formation of mammary tumors, and 50% of mice were tumor-free till 45 weeks of the experiment, whereas all sham-treated mice developed tumors and succumbed to the disease. This vaccine also resulted in significant increase in tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells and a decrease in the intratumoral FoxP3 + T reg cells (Shahabi et al. 2011) . P. aeruginosa can also deliver heterologous antigens using its type III secretion system. In an experimental model of B-cell melanoma expressing ovalbumin (OVA), Chauchet et al. demonstrated antitumor efficacy of P. aeruginosa-based vaccine expressing OVA. P. aeruginosa induced a long-lasting and polyfunctional CD8 + T-cell immune response against the cognate antigen, wherein antigen-specific CD8 + T cells expressed IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL2 simultaneously. These CD8 + T cells also showed enhanced tumor infiltration property and a greater ratio between effector versus regulatory T cells (Chauchet et al. 2016) . Recently Mei et al. utilized a composite approach of DNA vaccine and bacterial surface expression to achieve CD8 + and CD4 + T-cell-mediated immunity targeted to a tumor-associated antigen. The Salmonella-based vaccine included AIDA-I autotransporter-Melan A (a murine melanoma antigen) fusion protein and a DNA vaccine element encoding two murine melanoma epitopes (Mei et al. 2017 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 869, "end": 890, "text": "(Wallecha et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1522, "text": "(Shahabi et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 2113, "end": 2135, "text": "(Chauchet et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2520, "text": "(Mei et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Immunotherapy Against Cancer Using Live-Attenuated Bacterial Vectors"}, {"text": "High levels of antigen synthesis by multicopy plasmids exert metabolic burden to LABV, which results in hyperattenuation, low colonization, loss of viability, and most importantly poor immunogenicity. Various strategies have been adapted to circumvent this problem including the use of low-copy plasmid, use of in vivo inducible promoters (IVIP), and use of arabinose-inducible promoters (Loessner et al. 2007 ). Among the first promoters introduced in LABV is P nir B, which is activated under anaerobic conditions. P pag C and P ssa G are macrophage-inducible promoters from Salmonella. Dunstan directly compared the immunogenicity of antigens upon expression of antigens regulated by P nir B and P pag C and found significantly higher antibody response with P pag C compared to P nir B (Dunstan et al. 1999 ). Arnold et al. achieved differential antigen expression in vivo using in vivo inducible promoters P pag C, comprising variable ribosomal binding site (RBS). By this approach, strains with a high level of expression of heterologous protein exhibited low level of colonization, while a moderate amount of expression resulted in a significantly improved infection rate in mesenteric lymph nodes. A very low level of in vivo inducible antigen expression resulted in unhampered infectivity compared to the parent strain. Immunogenicity was dependent on the rate of infection, as well as the level of antigen expression. Notably, the best immune response was achieved with moderate level of antigen expression and infectivity, while high antigenexpressing strain resulted in little to no immune response. On the other hand, a moderate level of immune response was generated with high infectivity and low antigen expression (Arnold et al. 2004 ). Wang et al. developed a regulated delayed antigen synthesis system, consisting of LacI repressor to repress transcription from P trc during in vitro cultivation. The arabinose-regulated promoter P BAD drives LacI expression in vitro in medium supplemented with arabinose. Upon immunization and lack of external arabinose supplementation, P trc is derepressed, leading to the synthesis of antigens. The regulated delayed antigen synthesis system induced equivalent levels of antibody and protection to that of P pag C-controlled antigen synthesis and better than that of P ssa G-controlled antigen synthesis ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 388, "end": 409, "text": "(Loessner et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 789, "end": 809, "text": "(Dunstan et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1748, "text": "(Arnold et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Control of Gene Expression: Use of Plasmid Copy Number and In Vivo Promoters"}, {"text": "Upon oral immunization, LABV must withstand acidic environment of the stomach for successful colonization.

To circumvent this problem, Curtiss et al. generated a regulated delayed attenuation system (RDAS), which retains full virulence till the passage through gastrointestinal tract and infection of epithelial cells. In the modified RDAS strains, Salmonella virulence genes fur, PhoP/Q, rpoS, and crp are expressed under the control of araC-P BAD promoter. Arabinose concentration in human tissues is very less. Thus, in vitro these strains express all the virulence genes in medium supplemented with arabinose, whereas in vivo under the arabinose deprivation, many virulence genes are suppressed, resulting in attenuation of Salmonella.

On the other hand, escape from endocytic vacuoles is also a feasible approach. Unlike Lm, ST and STm do not reach cytoplasm of infected cells and elicit CD4 + T-cell response more effectively compared to CD8 + T-cell response to cognate antigens. Chen et al. used secretion signal of a type III secretion system Salmonella outer protein E (SopE) and HlyA (secretion signal) to deliver S. japonicum antigen Sj23-LHD-GST. The Salmonella vaccine constructs carrying Sj23 LHD-GST fused to HlyA (secretion signal) or SopE effectively expressed and delivered antigens into cytoplasm of murine macrophages in vitro. This vaccine construct induced Sj23-LHD-GST-specific Th1 type response and protected against S. japonicum infection (Chen et al. 2011).

LABVs possess the capacity to induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immune response. While the humoral immune response includes serum IgG and mucosal IgG and IgA, the cell-mediated immunity is characterized by Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-type CD4+ T cells and CD8+ CTLs. IgA and IL17 have been specifically implicated in mucosal protection against various mucosal pathogens. The cell-mediated immunity is required for intracellular pathogens. It should be noted that subunit vaccines have a poor capacity to evoke mucosal as well as cell-mediated immunity. LABVs have also shown the capacity to overcome immunosuppressive nature of various forms of tumors. These characteristic of LABVs, together with their tumor-tropic capacity, makes them a highly suitable vector for cancer immunotherapeutic vaccines. In the past two decades, tremendous progress has been made regarding LABV-mediated delivery of vaccine antigens for prevention of a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases. Recent advances have further improved the safety and immunogenicity profile of several LABV platforms. The new-generation LABVs can withstand harsh physicochemical conditions of gastrointestinal tract, exhibit regulated attenuation, regulated antigen expression, and targeted antigen delivery. LABVs have exhibited effectiveness in various preclinical and preliminary clinical trials (Table 2 .1). However, a limited number of clinical trials have been conducted to date using LABVs, due to potential safety concerns. Further optimization would result in a versatile, safe, and highly immunogenic vaccine delivery platforms. Ding et al. (2013) ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1745, "end": 1763, "text": "Ding et al.

Heterologous antigens carried by Salmonella elicit serum IgG(Frey et al. 2013), mucosal IgA(Allen et al. 2000;Ferreira Oliveira et al. 2012;Pei et al. 2015;Lalsiamthara and Lee 2017), CD4 +(Ramirez et al. 2009;Ashraf et al. 2011), and CD8 + T cells(Luria-Perez et al. 2007;Sevil Dom\u00e8nech et al. 2008;Berchtold et al. 2009). Due to the versatile immune response elicited by Salmonella, ST-and STm-based LABVs have been utilized to develop vaccines against numerous viral, bacterial (extracellular and intracellular), and parasitic pathogens. Importantly, it is well known that neutralizing antibodies and CTL responses confer adequate protection against viral pathogens; thus ST-and STm-based LABVs are capable of eliciting adequate antiviral immune responses. Antigens from viral pathogens including H1N1, H5N1, HIV, and SARS virus, when delivered by ST or STm, elicit antigen-specific antibody response(Karpenko et al. 2004;Luo et al. 2007;Pei et al. 2015;Hajam and Lee 2017). On the other hand, CTL response is generated against dengue virus (NS3) and HIV antigens(Karpenko et al. 2004;Luria-Perez et al. 2007). LABVs based on ST and STm elicit serum IgG, mucosal IgA, CD4 + T-cell, and CD8 + T-cell responses against a variety of bacterial pathogens including B. anthracis(Galen et al. 2010), B. pertussis(Dalla Pozza et al. 1998), E. coli(Ferreira Oliveira et al. 2012), Helicobacter pylori", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": ").
