However, its sensitivity and specificity is limited at about 80\u201390%, even in the best of settings (Reyburn et al., 2006). Because of the limitations of microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were implemented for malaria diagnosis in healthcare and research. Despite their significant contribution in the diagnosis of malaria because of the ease with which they can be performed, RDTs have several limitations, such as cross-reactivity with heterophile antibodies and rheumatoid factors, false positivity due to a previous infection, and decreased sensitivity in some instances, especially in the case of lower parasite densities (Wongsrichanalai et al., 2007). On the other hand, genetic diversity and deletion of histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) can lead to false-negative diagnosis, especially in Peruvian cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which lack HRP2 and HRP3 (Baker et al., 2005, Gamboa et al., 2010). Furthermore, failure to maintain the expected quality in each production cycle and the inability to monitor treatment follow-up have made RDTs unreliable in some instances (Alam et al., 2011, Murray and Bennett, 2009, Wilson, 2012).",

Four specially designed primers and two additional loop forming primers amplify the target DNA with a large fragment of Bst polymerase, which has exclusive strand displacement activity in the LAMP method.

            "text": "Despite these developments, visual detection of the LAMP product requires practical skill, and individual variation occurs in detecting positive reactions, especially in the setting of lower copy numbers of template DNA (Goto et al., 2009). Furthermore, a turbidity meter or fluorescent reader or portable fluorescence reader increases the cost and the number of instruments required. Post-addition of SYBR Green requires opening of the reaction tubes, which may lead to severe contamination in the laboratory, whereas pre-addition to the reaction mixture inhibits the amplification reactions. Pre-addition of Calcein with MnCl2 can surmount the problem of contamination, but it does not lead to significant development in the visual system (Goto et al., 2009). Moreover, cost is a big constraint in using SYBR Green and Calcein in LAMP visualization. Goto et al. (2009) introduced the concept of pre-addition of hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB), a cheap and easily visible dye in the reaction mixture, that does not inhibit the amplification. Massive amplification produces a pyro-phosphate by-product that precipitates with Mg2+ ion in the solution. In this process, HNB, the magnesium-chelating dye, loses its bound magnesium to provide magnesium to pyrophosphate, which has stronger affinity to magnesium than HNB. Consequently, absorption and emission spectra of the HNB complex are altered. Eventually, the color of the reaction mixture changes from violet to sky blue. Moreover, HNB provides a detection threshold similar to that provided by SYBR Green (Goto et al., 2009). Consequently, several LAMP-based methods were developed using HNB for the diagnosis of various targets such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coronavirus, trypansomes, and influenza H1N1 (Cardoso et al., 2010, Grab et al., 2011, Hong et al., 2012, Ma et al., 2010).",

The same primer set was replicated in the genus-and species-specific LAMP described by Han et al. (2007), where all of the 12 microscopy and PCR-positive P. falciparum samples were successfully detected by LAMP. Poschl et al. (2010) described 100% sensitivity and specificity of LAMP compared to nested PCR using the same primer set and reaction conditions. Lucchi et al. (2010) have also utilized the same primer set in real-time fluorescence LAMP with portable fluorescence reader, with 98.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity, while Paris et al. (2007) described 73.1% sensitivity compared to microscopy using the same primer set with 100% specificity. In this study, the primer set described by Poon et al. (2006) has failed to detect five real-time PCR-positive samples despite the pre-addition of HNB for easy visual detection, while four of the samples were positive by microscopy also. Three of these four samples had parasitemia of 16 parasites/\u03bcL. However, one sample was found positive only when real-time PCR crossed the detection threshold in its last cycle. This study also confirmed that the primer set described by Poon et al. (2006) can detect a minimum of 100 parasites/\u03bcL. Thus, it is an inherent limitation of Poon et al.\u2019s (2006) primer set that it would miss those four samples. However, this set also failed to detect one P. falciparum positive sample of 25,000 parasites/\u03bcL. Any significant mutation in the extremes of the primer-binding site as discussed earlier might contribute to this phenomenon. On the other hand, the fact that one negative sample was a false-positive for P. falciparum using this primer set may be due to rare cross-reactivity of the primers. Both of these discordant events were not confirmed by sequence analysis in this study. The factors discussed here might also contribute to such variations in outcome of the same primer set in the different studies mentioned above.",

This primer set can efficiently bind with three copies of 18S rRNA genes residual of at least three different chromosomes of the same parasite (NCBI BLAST request ID: DD77A3ZC0R, DD7KBG8J016, DD80J0X6013). Since this primer set can detect 5 parasites/\u03bcL, it requires approximately 15 copies of template to obtain significant visible amplification. However, Notomi et al. (2000), in their initial design, mentioned that the LAMP method can conduct visible amplification from six copies of template within 45 min when primer designing and reaction conditions are perfectly optimized. This primer set have failed to detect two of the real-time PCR-positive samples when one of them was microscopically positive with a low parasitemia (16 parasites/\u03bcL). These real-time PCR-positive samples had high threshold values and low relative fluorescence unit (RFU). Both the samples also tested negative by the LAMP method of Poon et al. (2006). Despite this minor incongruity in sensitivity, the new primer set was 100% successful in avoiding false-positive diagnosis due to cross-reactivity.",

This primer set is 93.3% sensitive and 100% specific in identifying P. falciparum cases. Recently, a commercial Pan/Pf LAMP assay was developed and evaluated in two different settings (Hopkins et al., 2013, Polley et al., 2013). Both of these studies reported highly sensitive detection of malaria cases but one study (Hopkins et al., 2013) reported compromised specificity and NPV when implemented in field, which is due to the detection of a high number of false-positive samples. The kit used expensive Calcein or turbidity meter. Calcein fluorescence has some drawbacks also, such as lower detection sensitivity and brightness of the fluorescence (Goto et al., 2009).",
