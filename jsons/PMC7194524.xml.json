In South Korea, the first case of COVID-19, a Chinese individual, was detected on January 19, 2020. As of March 30, 2020, there have been 9,786 confirmed cases in South Korea, including 162 deaths[2]. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people through close contact or droplets, and sometimes via airborne particles, especially those formed by aerosol-generating procedures [3]. Asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients, including those with low-grade fever or cough, can also be contagious to other people, which threatens quarantine or infection control [4]. Based on the experience of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2015 in South Korea, healthcare facility-associated nosocomial transmission can be an important route of spreading COVID-19[[5], [6], [7], [8]].",

We strengthened triage at the first point of entry at the emergency room and at the main hospital entrance for early case detection and prevention of in-hospital transmission. Checklists for patients with febrile respiratory symptoms, travel history, or contact status with confirmed COVID-19 cases were prepared. The checklists were handed to the medical staff and employees who interact with visitors, including patients, and were used to assess all patients who visited the hospital. Following closure of all entrances to the hospital, except for the main entrance, the numbers of visitors and caregivers to the sick were restricted. The need for personal hand hygiene was emphasized to all staff and visitors. Surgical masks were provided to all visitors, employees who interacted with patients, and healthcare workers who took care of patients. Specifically, N95 masks, face shields or goggles, and long-sleeved gowns and gloves were provided to healthcare workers at the emergency department, respiratory care center, or those performing aerosol-generating procedures. Individual visits to the hospital were restricted, except for emergencies, if an individual had travelled to an area with ongoing community transmission within the previous 14 days, or had had close contact with an infected person. Several informative signboards for patients with febrile respiratory symptoms were set up at the hospital entrance, and suspected patients with febrile respiratory symptoms were separated from others even in the absence of symptoms. We divided the hospital into three zones, according to risk stratification (Fig 1\n). The main clinical hospital was maintained as the clean zone, and a separate temporary building (the moderate-risk zone) was used for suspected COVID-19 cases, such as individuals with febrile respiratory symptoms without an obvious epidemiological link. Another separate area at the emergency department (the high-risk zone) was used for patients with high risk of COVID-19 infection, for example, individuals with febrile respiratory syndromes and a history of contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19.",

The cohort area was not accessible to patients with non-febrile respiratory symptoms. When patients with febrile respiratory symptoms came to the emergency room, they were immediately isolated in a negative-pressure isolation room in the cohort area in the emergency department. Well-trained critical care physicians wearing protective equipment took their detailed history, including contact with COVID-19 cases or travel history, and performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19, as per the doctor\u2019s recommendation. Based on the recommendation of the infectious disease experts, individuals with negative PCR test results for COVID-19 and no evidence of pneumonia were transferred from the emergency room to cohort wards, if they were stable, or cohort ICU, if they were unstable. In case of evidence of atypical pneumonia and a negative PCR test, the individuals were transferred from the emergency room to a negative-pressure isolation room, and a PCR test was performed repeatedly, as per the infectious disease expert\u2019s recommendation.",
