Antiviral drugs for IV, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, reduce the duration, frequency of symptoms, and hospitalization if administered within 48 h of the onset of symptoms (Aoki et al., 2003; Hayden et al., 1997). Moreover, rapid detection of these viruses is important in the clinical management of patients and for the reduction of healthcare costs (Bonner et al., 2003). However, the clinical signs and symptoms of these viruses are sometimes similar, and it can be difficult to distinguish between causative viruses especially in the incipient stage of disease (Zambon et al., 2001).",

            "text": "In addition to the widely used detection methods for these diseases, including viral cultures, serology, real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR), and rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs), several new methods that are easy-to-use and sensitive are currently being developed (Guatelli et al., 1990; Ishiguro et al., 2003; Kouguchi et al., 2010). One newly developed test is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, a rapid and sensitive nucleic acid amplification method that is performed under isothermal conditions and requires less complicated equipment than PCR (Nagamine et al., 2002; Notomi et al., 2000). This method can yield results in less than 1 h and can be utilized for the detection of many kinds of viral genomes (Kurosaki et al., 2016; Shirato et al., 2014; Yamazaki et al., 2013). A LAMP reaction can be monitored in real time by measuring the progressive increase in sample turbidity due to the precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate (Mori et al., 2001), but this technology may compromise the specificity of the test because of the exponential amplification of primer dimers (Njiru, 2012) and, in some cases, the detection of non-specific LAMP products made by host-derived DNA. DNA intercalators or fluorescent dyes, such as calcein, can also be used for real-time monitoring of the LAMP reaction (Seyrig et al., 2015; Tomita et al., 2008). Although these methods yield higher analytical sensitivity and shortened reaction times compared with turbidity-based real-time LAMP, the detection principles of the methods are the same.",

RT-LAMP was performed using a 25 \u03bcL volume reaction mix that contained 5 \u03bcL template RNA, 1.4 mM of each dNTP, 0.8 M betaine, 20 mM Tris\u2212HCl (pH 8.8), 70 mM KCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Tween 20, 8 U Bst 2.0 polymerase (New England Biolabs), and 0.25 U AMV reverse transcriptase (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The reaction mixture also contained 0.2 \u03bcM each of F3 and B3 primers, 1.6 \u03bcM each of FIP and BIP primers, and 0.8 \u03bcM each of LF and LB primers for each assay. In the IAV and A/H3 assay, the final concentration of each F3 and B3 primer was 0.2 \u03bcM, although more than 2 primers were used as F3 and B3 primers. For the novel rRT-LAMP assay, 5% of the LB or LF primer of each assay was substituted by the QPrimer-5 G (Nippon Steel and Sumikin Eco-Tech, Tokyo, Japan). The rRT-LAMP reaction was performed at 63 \u00b0C for 30 min using LightCycler\u00ae 480 II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Fluorescence was measured at wavelengths of 465 nm (excitation) and 510 nm (emission) after 4 min of reaction and again every 1 min thereafter. The results were determined by observation in real time and considered positive following fluorescence quenching. To compare with a turbidity-based rRT-LAMP assay, the time to positivity was considered as the first time the fluorescence quench rate increased by more than 3% within 3 min. To obtain the relative fluorescence rate at each detection point, the fluorescence intensity measured at each time point was divided by that measured at the beginning. The turbidity-based rRT-LAMP assay was conducted at 63 \u00b0C for 30 min using Loopamp Realtime Turbidimeter LA-320C (Eiken Chemical). Turbidity readings of the optimal density at 650 nm (OD650) were obtained every 6 s, and the reaction was considered positive when the turbidity values were over 0.05. To obtain corrected absorbance, the average turbidity from 2 to 5 min after the initiation of the LAMP reaction was used as the correction base line. GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate the figures.",

On the other hand, the precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate increases as the LAMP reaction proceeds in the turbidity-based rRT-LAMP assay (Fig. 1\n). The reaction times of rRT-LAMP for IAV in the two types of LAMP detection, namely, turbidity and QPrimer, were examined. To compare the reaction times in the two formats, various concentrations of in vitro-transcribed RNA were used. The RNA detection time at each dilution point by QPrimer was earlier than that by turbidity measurements, and the detection rate of target RNAs was more stable in the novel QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assay compared with the turbidity-based RT-LAMP assay (Table 3\n).",

Currently, RADTs are widely used and popular at clinical sites because it is considered important to provide early treatment for IV and RSV and avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotic therapy. However, the sensitivity and specificity of some RADTs remain relatively poor, especially those for RSV (sensitivity range, 71.15\u201380.77%) (Bell et al., 2014; Dunn et al., 2014; Kanwar et al., 2015). The novel QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assays enabled the detection of each target gene at 25\u2013250 copies/reaction at the lowest concentration (Table 4) and showed less sensitive than the reference rRT-PCR assays which limit of detection were 6\u20139 copies/reaction as determined in previous studies (Nakauchi et al., 2014,). However, the QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assays showed high sensitivity (\u226585.0%) and sufficient clinical accuracy in clinical specimens from patients with influenza-like illness compared with RADTs. Furthermore, the design of QPrimer in the novel method is simple and universally applicable; specifically, part of one of the loop primers with a cytosine at the 5\u2032 end is substituted by the QPrimer, or it can add a cytosine to the 5\u2032 end of the QPrimer if there are no suitable loop primers with a cytosine at the 5\u2032 end, such as with the RSV B primer sets in this study (Table 1). The QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assays can be conducted using general-purpose real-time PCR instruments and an isothermal nucleic acid amplification system with fluorescence measurements.",

In addition, higher diagnostic test specificity was achieved and all assays had 100% specificity (Table 5). These valuable results agree with current reports on QPrimer and quenching probe (QProbe), which are used for amplicon detection in some nucleotide amplification methods (Ayukawa et al., 2017; Hiramatsu et al., 2017; Toyama et al., 2015). An rRT-PCR assay usually takes 1\u20132 h after sample preparation, whereas the novel QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assay provides positive results in around 15 min for samples with high concentrations of viral RNA, suggesting that this assay can be characterized by its rapid results.
