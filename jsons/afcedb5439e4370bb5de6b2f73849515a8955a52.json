Since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12, 2019, China has reported a total of 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020. Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19 epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e., Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the situation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the three models, the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447 in Wuhan,12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas and 80261-85140 in China respectively. The total death toll is 2502-5108 in Wuhan,",

By analyzing the intrinsic characteristics of wild species through machine learning, new reservoirs (mammals) and carriers (insects) of zoonotic diseases can be accurately predicted 19 . The overall goal of machine learning-based approach is to extend causal inference theory and machine learning to identify and quantify the most important factors that cause zoonotic disease outbreaks, and to generate visual tools to illustrate the complex causal relationships of animal infectious diseases and their correlation with zoonotic diseases 20 . However, the highly nonlinear and complex problems to be analyzed in the early prediction model of infectious diseases based on machine learning usually lead to local minima and global minima, leading to some limitations of the machine learning model. Infectious disease prediction models mainly include differential equation prediction models based on dynamics and time series prediction models based on statistics and random processes, Internet-based infectious disease prediction model and machine learning methods. Some models are too complicated and too many factors are considered, which often leads to over-fitting. In this paper, Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model, which are relatively simple but accord with the statistical law of epidemiology, are selected to predict the epidemic situation of COVID-19. After the model is selected, the least square method is used for curve fitting. Least square method is a mathematical optimization technique. It finds the best function match of data by minimizing the sum of squareed errors. Using the least square method, unknown data can be easily obtained, and the sum of squares of errors between these obtained data and actual data is minimized.",

The number of confirmed SARS cases no longer increased after June 11, 2003. On June 24, 2003, WHO announced the end of the SARS epidemic, that is, the time when the cumulative number of confirmed SARS cases reached the peak value was basically the time when the epidemic ended. We used this rule to predict the end of COVID-19 epidemic 21 .

The good fitting of the death toll of SARS in 2003 shows that Gompertz model and Logistic model can also be used to predict that of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

According to the prediction results of this article, the cumulative number of confirmed cases will reach maximum in Wuhan and the country around the end of March 2020 at the earliest and around April 2020 at the latest. The results are basically consistent with the results of the Zhong's team 22 that the basic control of the epidemic was at the end of April. The total number of confirmed diagnoses is predicted to be 49852-57447 in Wuhan, 12972-13405 in Non-Hubei areas, and 80261-85140 in China mainland. The predicted total death toll is 2502-5108 in Wuhan, 107-125 in non-Hubei areas, and 3150-6286 in China mainland. It should be noted that the China mainland data in this article are the data of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. In addition, another concerned question is: When will the epidemic of the new coronavirus COVID-19 end? Judging from the SARS situation in 2003, the date corresponding to the maximum number of cumulative diagnoses was basically the date when the epidemic ended. According to the results and data of this article, it is estimated that the epidemic of COVID-19 in novel coronavirus will end at the end of April 2020 in Wuhan and at the end of March 2020 in Non-Hubei areas. It is worth noting that the above results and conclusions are under the precondition that the prevention and control measures for the epidemic situation of COVID-19 are stable and reliable, foreign cases are not imported into China on a large scale, and the virus of COVID-19 does not produce new and serious acute variations.",

Considering that the later fitting results of the mathematical model is more important than the earlier fitting results, the fitting results of Logistic model may be more accurate, that is, the total death toll of COVID-19 is about 2502 in Wuhan, 107 in non-Hubei areas and 2150 in China mainland, respectively.",
