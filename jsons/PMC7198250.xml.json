Since its humble origins, the power of open source has stemmed from programmers who choose to contribute to projects of their interest, not by management control. To support voluntary cooperation across the Globe, various tools were introduced, including source control management tools such as Subversion and later Git. Distributed version control systems have enabled the development through pulling code from repositories to create software locally as a combination of several code sources. The range of components from operating and windowing systems to tiny, almost self-evident snippets have made open source systems an integral part of systems [22], many of which we do not consider as open source, and these are also visible in software architecture of many systems [23].",
