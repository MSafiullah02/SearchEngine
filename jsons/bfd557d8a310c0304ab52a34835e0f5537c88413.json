Awareness of the threat of influenza arises from its ability to spread and cause a pandemic. The undiagnosed and untreated viral infection can have a fatal effect on humans. Thus, the early detection seems pivotal for an accurate treatment, when vaccines and other contemporary prevention methods are not faultless. Public health is being attacked with influenza containing new genes from a genetic assortment between animals and humankind. Unfortunately, the population does not have immunity for mutant genes and is attacked in every viral outbreak season. For these reasons, fast and accurate devices are in high demand. As currently used methods like Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests lack specificity, time and cost-savings, new methods are being developed. In the article, various novel detection methods, such as electrical and optical were compared. Different viral elements used as detection targets and analysis parameters, such as sensitivity and specificity, were presented and discussed.",

            "text": "Influenza wears the name of 'the mother of all pandemics'. In particular, influenza A type has the ability to cause worldwide epidemics. In the last hundred years, virus attacks were documented four times: The Spanish flu (H1N1) in 1918, Asian flu (H2N2) in 1957, Hong Kong influenza (H3N2) in 1968 and swine influenza (H1N1) in 2009. It seems obvious to expect an influenza pandemic to return [3, 4] . The illness affects groups of all ages, and this pattern is not common for most viruses. There is a high possibility for every human to suffer from influenza. Groups infected are mostly schoolchildren, the elderly and patients with serious medical conditions. Infections of respiratory viruses, mainly influenza, and RSV, occur seasonally in winter months (from December to March) in Europe, what is less common in hot climates where rhinovirus is seen in fall and spring, while adenovirus infects all year [2] . Influenza spreads very easily among the population and shows high attack rates. In the US, it is the 8th highest cause of death, infects around 0.4 to 0.6 billion of children and 0.2 to 5.0 billion adults worldwide [5] , kills 0.5 to 1 million people annually with numbers still increasing [6, 7] .",

            "text": "The influenza virus construction is comparatively simple. It mainly contains 8-segmented RNA and surface proteins with highly immunogenic properties. Distinguishable are three types-influenza A, B, and C, all belonging to the Orthomyxovirus family. The A-type is mostly responsible for pandemics in the 20th-21st century. Two glycoproteins cover the viral surface: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) in a ratio of four to one [8] . Based on surface composition, distinguishable are 18 H (H1-H18) and 11 N (N1-N11) subtypes forming potentially 198 combinations [3] . Influenza A infects the human population, birds, pigs, dogs, horses and more [9] . Genetic recombination is possible through the segmented genome. Reassortment of genes is highly important in the epidemics. Human population does not have the immunity against mutants with new HA and NA antigens on the virion surface. There is a possibility of interspecies transmission without genetic reassortment, like in the case of H1N1 virus between swine and humans (and conversely) or H9N2 from poultry to humans. In other cases, RNA segment reassortment occurs if at least two influenza viruses infect a single hosts cell [10, 11] . Animal influenza viruses which occasionally infecting humans are called zoonotic influenza viruses (in direct and indirect contact) [12] . This high possibility of genetic variation can have subsequently pandemic effects. Most of the new influenza viruses are mutants forming from antigenic drift [11] .",

The terminal carbon-2 can bind to carbon-3 or carbon-6 of galactose, forming different \u03b1-linkages and steric configurations. In human population dominate \u03b1-2,6 bonds, while \u03b1-2,3 are also common; however, the latter are more common in other species (ducks, birds). So there is a possibility of human infection by avian influenza, but less efficiently [18, 19] . The next step is neuraminidase activity. Sialic acid is rifted from the cell's surface, what enables the influenza virus release and distribution in the respiratory tract. The NA protein plays a role in replication of A and B influenza types. The M2 protein is essential after cell entry through uncoating of influenza A virus [13] . Influenza incubation lasts 1 to 4 days, then the virus sheds and symptoms appear. Viruses circulate in a host for 5 to 10 days but decrease 3-5 days after the first symptoms [20] . Viral RNA genome is segmented thus recombination between different strains is possible. This process is called antigenic shift; however, it is sporadic and occurs less than once per decade [3] . As a result, surface glycoproteins undergo some variations (minor changes in amino acid sequence like point mutations in genes). The ability of influenza virus to progressive antigenic change forces updates of vaccines composition [21] . Influenza glycoproteins are an excellent target for virus detection due to many copies of HA (around 300) and NA (around 50) on one viral particle [21, 22] . ",

Results have shown for influenza A: BUDDI, Sofia, Veritor, and Bioline sensitivity on level 87.7%, 94.5%, 87.7%, and 72.6%, respectively and specificity: 100%, 97.7%, 96.5%, and 100%, respectively, which are only partially accurate with producers assurance. For influenza B, sensitivities and specificities were on similar levels. None of the tests showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses. The Sofia test with the fluorescence reader had the best sensitivities. RIDTs with digital readout systems showed many similarities to conventional assays like small sample volume (less than 150 \u00b5L) and short analysis time (around 15 min) but exhibited much better sensitivities, even one order of magnitude lower limits of detection (LODs).",

Some other technique, Illumina Platform, offers one million bases sequencing for the cost from $0.05 to $0.15 [67, 68] . In general, Illumina Platform is basing on the amplification of nucleic acid fragments on solid substrate or bridge amplification. Whitehead et al. [69] applied Illumina NGS platform to create sequence-function map to optimize influenza-binding proteins. This technique has big chances to develop new effective influenza inhibitors. Another Platform, Roche 454 Life Sciences, developed NGS platforms based on pyrosequencing. It has found application in influenza A case for molecular markers identification, gene coding M2 protein mutation identification or Single Nucleotide Polymorphism detection in the gene coding hemagglutinin [54] . Except listed above, there are more NGS Platforms, like Pacific Bioscience, Ion Proton, Complete Genomics and more, which use different sequencing techniques and have both advantages and limitations, vary on costs, read length, analysis time and error rate. For example, the Chembio portable lateral flow platform can be performed outside the laboratory giving results in 25 min. The Luminex analysis requires fewer reagents, offers fewer errors and a wide linear range [55] .",

Some of the approaches for influenza virus are presented in Figure 2 . Detection limits were shown in plaque forming units (PFU), g/L, viral copies, M, hemagglutinating units (HAU), and TCID 50 units. They were difficult to compare as relied on different quantification methods. Moreover, influenza have many components acting as target analytes, which in general are in different quantities/ratios in one viral particle or between influenza types/subtypes. Exemplary are DNA/RNA (quantified in copies/mL or M), HA (quantified in HAU) or whole viral particles (quantified in PFU). Comparison of most LODs between newly developed biosensors and different conventional methods were given. give detection of nucleic acids or specific viral antigens and promote practical and useful diagnosis [21] .

Electrochemical EIS biosensor for PB1-F2 was developed by Miodek et al. [112] The authors used antibody-antigen approach and modified gold electrode with a specific anti-PB1-F2 antibody with three steps. Firstly, pyrrole and ferrocene derivatives were electrochemically polymerized onto the Au surface. The next step was biotin/streptavidin linkage and the closing step was biotinylated antibodies immobilization. For confirmation of proper sensor modification the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques were used. By differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) two linear ranges were observed, 50-300 nM and 0.5-1.5 mM of PB1-F2 what was probably caused by two specific antibody sites. LOD was on 0.42 nM level.",

Electrochemical EIS biosensor for PB1-F2 was developed by Miodek et al. [112] The authors used antibody-antigen approach and modified gold electrode with a specific anti-PB1-F2 antibody with three steps. Firstly, pyrrole and ferrocene derivatives were electrochemically polymerized onto the Au surface. The next step was biotin/streptavidin linkage and the closing step was biotinylated antibodies immobilization. For confirmation of proper sensor modification the surface plasmon resonance (SPR), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques were used. By differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) two linear ranges were observed, 50-300 nM and 0.5-1.5 mM of PB1-F2 what was probably caused by two specific antibody sites. LOD was on 0.42 nM level.",

In this technique, the propagation of acoustic waves was changing at the measured material, depending on analytes located on the surface. Love waves detected antigens through specific antigen-antibody interaction. The authors have used two reagents that were effective for immobilizing HA antibodies on the measurement surface. They were triethoxysilybutyladehyde (ALTES) and triethoxysilylundecanal ethylene glycol acetal (ACTES), which were end-functionalized with carboxylic acid and aldehyde.

[18] invented the magnetic relaxation nanosensor (MRnS) which was selectively binding to hemagglutinins. The influenza virus variants detection was at 1.0 nM concentration level. Kirkegaard et al. [135] invented screen-printed aptasensor (PEDOT) for impedance-based influenza A detection. Ozcelik et al. [136] evaluated the optofluidic wavelength division multiplexing method for single-virus detection. The authors could distinguish three subtypes of influenza A using two approaches. First was virus labeling with different color labels, and second was the combination of two different colors for every viral strain. Lee et al. [137] presented quantitative H7N9 virus screening without DNA amplification, basing on single-particle dual-mode total internal reflection scattering (SD-TIRS) with transmission grating (TG). Chan et al. [138] claimed that the flow graphene transistor-based DNA sensors have not been explored yet, so they proposed microfluidic integrated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) transistor for the H5N1 influenza virus gene detection. Zhang et al. [139] elaborated a label-free optical sensor for influenza serotyping. The authors have used the pattern recognition method based on Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR) platform. When antireflective chip condition was perturbed due to binding to, e.g., an antibody, the reflected light changes were quantitatively detected. Katayama et al. [140] created an influenza virus biosensor based on two methods: electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of modified Au electrode combined with immunoliposome encapsulating Ru (II) complex. The authors have achieved sensitivity higher than ELISA; the detection range was from 2.7 \u00d7 10 2 to 2.7 \u00d7 10 3 PFU/mL. Li et al. [141] combined complement fixation and luminol chemiluminescence for rH7N9 detection, which is a recombinant avian influenza virus protein. This assay could be completed in 2.5 h with a linear detection from 0.25 fg/mL to 25 ng/mL. Tran et al. [142] detected influenza A viruses using carbon nanotubes field effect transistor (CNTFET) DNA sensor. The response time was less than 1 min, and the detection range was linear from 1 pM (LOD) to 10 nM. The sensor signal recovery was 97% after 7-month storage in pH-controlled conditions. The most interesting biosensors were compared in Table 2 . ",

They offer a vast number of electrode materials and target detection molecules with practically endless modification methods. Furthermore, these sensors successfully can be expanded for other pathogen detection by changing the kind of probe immobilized on the electrode surface.

            "text": "to various limitations in the conventional detection methods, new diagnostic approaches are being developed. Main trends for influenza virus detection are: (I) modifications of traditional 'gold star' methods like PCR, RIDTs, ELISA what results in analysis time shortening, costs lowering, LOD and limit of quantification (LOQ) improvement, (II) conjugating of traditional methods and creating new platforms, micro-biochips and others, (III) introducing known solutions to new ones, like smartphone-based analysis control with results data insertion into Google Maps, (IV) reuse of the functions of known devices, like glucometer, smartphone cameras, (V) the most common used detection methods: spectral/optical, electrical, (VI) and entirely new approaches. Some of the approaches for influenza virus are presented in Figure 2. Detection limits were shown in plaque forming units (PFU), g/L, viral copies, M, hemagglutinating units (HAU), and TCID50 units. They were difficult to compare as relied on different quantification methods. Moreover, influenza have many components acting as target analytes, which in general are in different quantities/ratios in one viral particle or between influenza types/subtypes. Exemplary are DNA/RNA (quantified in copies/mL or M), HA (quantified in HAU) or whole viral particles (quantified in PFU). Comparison of most LODs between newly developed biosensors and different conventional methods were given. Different approaches for influenza virus detection: (a) Reuse of known devices like glucometers; (b) Electrical detection system; (c) Strip-based sensor/ ELISA modifications; (d) Optical approaches using nanoparticles.",
