Implementation of official practical and protective guidelines can be challenging and is often absent. The purpose of this study was to describe the status of ophthalmology practice in Israel, at the early stages of the outbreak. Methods A 17-item questionnaire was distributed to ophthalmologists practicing in Israel. Data was obtained regarding demographics and clinical and surgical practice during the pandemic. Results One hundred and sixty-seven ophthalmologists completed the survey from all regions of Israel. The survey was distributed during the early stages of the outbreak. At this time, no official government guidelines were in place. Most respondents reported no reduction of elective clinic visits and surgeries and no utilization of triage questionnaires. COVID-19 guidelines were reportedly promulgated to hospital ophthalmologists but not to community and private physicians. Personal protective equipment (PPE) measures were reportedly utilized; however, many respondents often acquired them individually. A majority of respondents advocated that healthcare institutions limit clinic and surgery services to emergency services. Conclusion During the critical early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, this study emphasizes the delay in development of emergency guidelines, necessary to protect patients and ophthalmologists from this highly transmissible disease.",

In this surveybased study, we obtained the opinions of Israeli ophthalmologists regarding the risk of ophthalmologic practice during the local early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Responses were received from ophthalmologists in many departments in Israeli hospitals as well as health maintenance organizations and private clinics providing a highly representative sample. At the time of the survey, 3 weeks after the first reported case of COVID-19 in Israel, most ophthalmologists reported starting to utilize PPE during routine clinic visits. Many reported the need to obtain PPE independently, including ophthalmologists working in hospital settings. A large number of practitioners described not being informed of official COVID-19 clinic guidelines, especially ophthalmologists practicing in busy outpatient clinics of health maintenance organizations (Kupat Holim). The majority of respondents were of the opinion that clinic and surgical services should have been reduced to emergency services only. At the time of the survey while the outbreak was progressing, most physicians reported no reduction of patient volume.

Timely implementation of guidelines during this new pandemic is challenging for the health system. Delay of action, however, may endanger both the medical staff and patients at critical moments. This is particularly consequential in an ophthalmology setting where close contact occurs between elderly and asymptomatic young individuals recently identified as active viral carriers [11, 12] .",

As of the end of March, the international pandemic has progressed, and more than sixty physicians in Italy have already died, and many others in Europe and in the USA have tested positive for the virus [14] . The best explanation to why otherwise healthy individuals would succumb to the infection is related to the extent of the viral load on exposure and the mass of the COVID-19 inoculum [15] . This can be greatly reduced by utilization of proper PPE [16] , specifically N-95 masks, while performing invasive ophthalmologic procedures and the greater use of COVID-19 testing to identify patients with the viral infection. A promising advance is the use of antibody testing to identify physicians and healthcare workers who possess immunity to the virus, enabling these individuals to treat patients while ensuring their own safety [17] . As of April 6th, for the Israeli population estimated at 8,972,000 as of 2019, there are presently 8904 individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19, 56 of whom have died [18] . To our knowledge, there is one ophthalmologist who has tested positive for COVID 19. Routine testing of physicians is not presently being provided.",

Previous to this, no restriction of ambulatory services had been considered.

The findings from this questionnaire-based study show that at the onset of the pandemic in Israel, ophthalmologists described themselves as inadequately protected from COVID 19 infection and felt a lack of support. It is notable that the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, was initially identified by an ophthalmologist, Dr. Li Wenliang, who at 33 years of age contracted the virus in the early days of the outbreak and recently died of the disease [19] . Both his story and this survey emphasize the importance of attending to the safety of healthcare workers. For the first time in the lives of most physicians, the routine care of patients becomes a personal health care risk. As a result, physicians must prioritize their own health and safety as they continue to care for their patients. ",
