This chapter points out some of the reasons for the insufficient progress made by traditional approaches to development and humanitarian aid. It offers arguments why nonprofit institutions whose justification is to help, must begin by helping their staff to help themselves. Organizations with an inspiring social mission must practice internally what they preach externally. Whether these organizations live up to the inspirational potential that goes with their mandate, is conditioned by their ability to place the aspiration for meaning at the center of their action, internally and externally.",

Historically, through the ebb and flow of changes, there have been good, peaceful, and prosperous periods, and others marked by violent conflict, despair, and unequal social and economic outcomes. In our time, the prospects seem ominous (Brown and Selvadurai 2011) . 1 Fortunately, every trial contains an opportunity. For instance, ninety percent of the projected population growth between now and 2050 will be in the developing World, with a correlation between youth bulges and armed conflict (Urdal 2006) . This trend will increase the demand for food, energy, water, and space, eventually outpacing supply and the various nation-states' management ability and capacity to resolve the dilemma. This is likely to further exacerbate local and global tensions. At the same time, the massive mobilization of youthled movements against climate change that began in 2018 illustrates the positive and transformational power that the global community has at its disposal in the form of young aspirations and fresh minds.",

'The goal should be a shared sense of challenges in a world where all people are equal ' (Brown and Selvadurai 2011) , as stated in the Wilton Park conference report. However, 'should be' does not equal 'is'. Lingering phenomena Everything is connected and constantly changing. What materializes around us has started at the center and is nurtured from the periphery. Experience results from a continuum in which seemingly opposites complement each other like inequality and climate combusting 'will not be brought down by paying more lip service to it or by conducting more research that stays in an ivory tower' (Vandermoortele 2019) . Resolving challenges which engender harm, be it to ourselves or others, requires a triple shift: from acknowledging the issue, to mustering the courage to addressing it, to actually translating the desire for change into concrete behavior change, beginning with our own personal action. Words leave ample space for altruism and open-mindedness. Paper is patient, and strangely, so is the internet, despite its frenzied publication speed. Impact measurement differs from output volume. While the sheer quantity of data coming from Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms is gratifying for results-oriented activists, tangible evidence to prove the influence of online mobilization on human behavior remains sparse. Beyond clicks, likes, and short-term donations, the sustainable transformation of attitudes and belief-systems remains one of the unexplored frontiers of social change. There is little evidence that, once a Twitter storm has raged for a time and the calm has returned, there is any real and meaningful change.",

Amid this abundance and diversity, one common parameter seems to characterize and connect those rare institutions that have outlasted the start-up stage and moved past log frames and matrix madness, donor domination, and implementation illusion. This parameter is the level to which their staff personifies the values that the organization pursues. Beyond funding level and mission statement, marketing creativity and positioning skills, at the heart of aid groups and nonprofit organizations that survive and leave their mark is the mindset of those who work inside the organization. This mindset matters more than anything else, with organizational performance linked to whether the personal aspirations and the subsequent behavior of the staff are in synch with the mission of their employer. Do their inner values match those of the organization? Do they live by the code of these values in everyday life, both in the spotlight and the shadows? Do they practice what they preach?",

            "text": "The quest to influence the attitudes, beliefs, and behavior of so-called beneficiaries of aid programs has gradually led to the field of Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC). As understood already in the 1980s, 'social marketing is an underutilized yet powerful means of changing behavior', 4 and thereby changing Society. But even though the scientific research that many SBCC approaches use to understand their target adopters makes them a resource to learn from, the present state of the World seems to indicate that their impact is limited. One shortcoming is that they have failed to delve deep enough to pierce through to the level of understanding into implementation. Even in the cases where in-depth Knowledge Attitude Practice (KAP) studies were conducted to understand the factors that underpin certain behavior patterns and the social norms underneath, action usually fell short (Zaltman 1971) . The current fast-paced, short-lived nature of most aid programs is not conducive to the implementation of systematic long-term programs dedicated to behavioral change. Results-based management can be a blessing or a curse, depending on the orientation behind it. It may nurture a culture of seeking concrete and meaningful transformation, but it can also lead to a focus on material assets that can be touched, counted, and photographed. The abundance of clinics and community health centers that were built with the funds of well-intentioned donors but subsequently abandoned for lack of staff, equipment, medication, or demand is just one illustration of this phenomenon. As the absence of large-scale sustainable transformation seems to indicate, a different approach is required rather than more of the same. As the popular saying goes, 'If you always do what you always did, you will always get what you always got ' (O'Toole 2019).",

These questions require an honesty that does not come naturally or easily to institutions or individuals. Human nature is geared towards the path of least resistance, while soul searching is cumbersome and awkward. A most obvious question for all concerned: 'Do those who defend human rights as part of their profession, such as United Nation officials, Government agents, or NGO workers, inspire by example?' At the beginning of their career, those who choose to work in the aid sector are usually driven by genuine passion. They believe that making the World a better place can and must be done. But as time passes, experience intrudes, disappointments are encountered, and habits take root; things change. Slowly passion fades; cynicism, fatigue, and disillusionment creep in. Standing up for change, beyond institutional campaign orchestration, no longer comes intuitively. Some leave, many stay. Material considerations, paychecks, promotions, and pension perspectives become criteria when earlier they were not.",

Rather than critical or creative thinking that pushes the collective envelope toward inclusive prosperity, it leaves personal agendas and reactivity to set the pace of change. Change is needed, and yet it will not come easily because changing the status quo is not a one-step quick fix. This is a difficult sell in a World that is turning ever faster, with a populace that has matured with the need for instant gratification.

We aim to be perceived that way by others, especially by those who matter to us. However, we are also prone, if the occasion presents itself, to follow the path of least resistance, slipping easily into the role of the passive bystander (Sommers 2011) . Taking this two-sided coin and our natural inclination into account, the all too common portrayal of populations as poor, desperate, and helpless with the objective of triggering generosity may work in the short term by generating pity. Yet, in the long term it causes alienation, because it establishes separation between those who have resources and those who are in need, widening the gap between the donor and the so-called beneficiaries. This distance is among the primary reasons why assistance is not given in the first place or leads only to short-term support. The more we perceive ourselves as different from the person in need, the less likely we are to help (Manning et al. 2007 ).",

The length of the preceding journey and the various investments that we have made along the way may discourage us from even contemplating the possibility, or worse, the necessity, of change. This, combined with inertia, and the 'sunk cost fallacy' whereby humans seek to avoid lost cause realization, usually results in 'loss aversion' (Kahneman 2011) . 'Loss aversion' prevents us from choosing to think about uncomfortable choices and the related consequences. Even though we all have moments of quiet where we realize the discrepancy between our aspirations and our present orientation, 'loss aversion' increases the likelihood that we will not move toward the first step of such introspection. This first step is to honestly admit to ourselves that we are on the wrong track. Only once we have passed this stage of inner awareness can we move forward, transcending the instinctive justification of the status quo, including monetary circumstances, relational obligations, age, etc. Subsequently, if our personal aspirations are clear and present in our heart and mind, then the last step flows calmly, naturally. The described change process smoothly leads us to translate awareness not only into desire for change, but into concrete action to make it happen. Enacting our values, pursuing our dreams, and realizing our existential aspiration for meaning, which necessarily involves others, are possible at any time.",
