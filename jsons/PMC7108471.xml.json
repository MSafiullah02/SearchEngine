The negative control probe was designed for the hybridization background. The most important control was the inner positive control that was used for evaluating the validity of the molecular biology operating processes such as RNA/DNA purification, RT-PCR, microarray hybridization, and hybridization image capture.

Three kinds of signal groups could be detected on the microarray for analyzing the reliability of the hybridization results. From the position signals we obtained the immobilized efficiency and the relative position of the probes. In general, because of the effect of hybridization efficiency, the fluorescence intensity of the position probes should be higher than that of hybridization probes. Therefore the fluorescence signals of the hybridization image were classified into 3 groups: the position signal, the negative signal, and the hybridization signals, which include inner control signals. All reliable results of fluorescent hybridization images should contain the above 3 signal groups. In the in-house developed software for the microarray-in-a-tube system, the fluorescence intensities were <5 for the negative result and >50 for the position marker. The fluorescence intensity of the inner positive control should be >20 and less than that of the position marker, otherwise the result should be discarded and the detection should be performed again. If the fluorescence intensity of the detection probes was >50% of the inner positive control it was considered a positive result. If <40%, it was considered a negative result.",

Two molecular beacons, modified at the 5\u2032-terminal with NH2 groups and immobilized on activated agarose film, were used for HCoV-SARS detection, as shown in Table 3 in the online Data Supplement). The hybridization buffer contained 50 mmol/L MgCl2 in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. Before hybridization, the microarray-in-a-tube system was incubated in the hybridization buffer for 30 min at room temperature. The asymmetrical RT-PCR and hybridized were described as above. Fluorescence images before and after hybridization are shown in Fig. 5 . We were able to use these molecular beacons for HCoV-SARS detection in our microarray-in-a-tube system, but there was relatively high fluorescence background attributable to the unstable stem structure in the molecular beacon probes immobilized on the surface, and the molecular beacon probes are much more expensive than ordinary oligonucleotide probes, which we used successfully for virus detection in our system.",
