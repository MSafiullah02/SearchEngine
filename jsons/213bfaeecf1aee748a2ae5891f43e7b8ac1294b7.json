To allow every laboratory or hospital access to an in-house assay, we developed two low-cost SARS-CoV-2 detection assay protocols using inhouse primers and reagents/equipment on hand in most biology or diagnostic laboratories: a SYBR Green-based RT-PCR and PCR assays. RNA extraction has also become a major bottleneck due to limited supplies and the required labor. Thus, we validated alternative RNA extraction protocols.",

The most accurate heat-processing technique for primers with short amplicon lengths was 95 \u03bf C for 15 mins. Of 40 samples, both the SYBR Green-based quantitative RT-PCR assay and the PCR assay detected SARS-CoV-2 target genes in 28 samples, with no false-positive or false-negative results. These findings were 100% concordant with those of the diagnostic laboratory that tested the same samples using a Rotor-Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 kit (R2=0.889).",

People who carry the virus without showing any symptoms pose a major silent threat to public health because they are unknowingly spreading the virus. However, not all countries, hospitals, or laboratories have access to testing kits or to the reagents and supplies that are currently in high demand with which they could make their own kits. In addition, many hospitals and diagnostic laboratories are struggling with an overwhelming number of samples that have been collected but still require testing. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop and validate two inexpensive assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples in almost any laboratory or hospital in a timely manner and without commercial, ready-made extraction or detection kits. Both assays can use a TRI reagent-based RNA extraction or heat-processed samples for RNA extraction. The RNA extraction procedure is followed by cDNA synthesis then a SYBR Green-based RT-PCR or conventional PCR assay that requires only basic science techniques and equipment. Here we provide two validated protocols for safely detecting SARS-CoV-2 in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratories within a limited budget by using these easily performed assays.",

However, recent studies have stated some concerns regarding the specificity of the RT-PCR tests for patients with COVID-19 [6] . Indeed, inaccurate results, especially a false-negative, have dire implications for subsequent community transmission of the virus [7] . Therefore, the inclusion of two SARS-CoV-2 genes for accurate detection has been advised [8] . In the present study, we designed sets of primers that target the E and RdRp genes of the virus. SYBR Green quantitative PCR is widely used because of the ease in assay design and its relatively low setup and running costs. Unlike TaqMan fluorescent probes, SYBR Green dye intercalates into double-stranded DNA to monitor the amplification of the target gene specifically initiated by gene-specific primers [9] . However, one drawback of the SYBR Green assay is that the dye is nonspecific, and this lack of specificity can generate false-positive signals if nonspecific products or primer-dimers are present in the sample. However, including a melting curve analysis at the end of each PCR assay to determine the specificity and efficiency of each RT-PCR reaction will ensure the accuracy of the results when multiple peaks or primer-dimers are not observed. Another potential drawback of the SYBR Green assay is that the length of the amplicon may affect the intensity of the amplification; thus, the present study designed primers for an amplicon less than 120 base pairs. The World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization published a recommendation for general procedures for inactivation of potentially infectious samples with Ebola virus and other highly pathogenic viral agents, indicating that using TRI reagent offers .

Although the PCR assay was more cost effective than the SYBR Green quantitative RT-PCR assay, PRC is more laborious and requires a longer time to complete (approximately 7 hours) than the SYBR Green assay, which requires approximately 4 hours. The time is longer for both techniques than that for using a commercially available detection kit because the two assays developed here are conducted manually. However, the cost for any commercial kit is considerably higher. Of the two manually conducted assay options we developed and validated for detecting SARS-CoV-2, we believe that the SYBR Green assay using RT-PCR is the more favorable choice owing to its potential power in the field of virology, the speed of conducting the assay, and real-time data analysis. The PCR assay was developed and validated as an alternative approach in the event that a laboratory does not have an RT-PCR instrument [11] .",

Heating samples and using SYBR-Green or PCR assays might be not the ultimate solution for sensitive and accurate diagnoses; however, at a time when SARS-CoV-2 is globally pervasive and deadly and commercial kits are limited, these assays offer viable alternative testing approaches. In addition, these protocols provide virus testing platforms for future threats because the only change that would be required to follow the same protocols to test for a different virus would be the pathogen sequence needed to design specific primers. Furthermore, the protocols have been approved by the Saudi Food and Drug Administration as Emergency Use Authorization for use in a clinical setting.",
