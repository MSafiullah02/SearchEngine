Its prediction model simply approximated the health hazard with physical observations, which aimed at quantitatively analyzing the relationship and generating a standard for rating smog disasters\u05f3 health hazard. The work presented in this paper actually extends our previous work [24] from historical relationship analysis to real-time forecasting. Our another work [25] in progress aims at forecasting smog disaster directly with different kinds of data including social media data. It will reinforce our study for decision making under smog disasters, but is quite different from the health hazard forecasting topic presented in this paper.",

In our ongoing study [25], which applies different social observations and physical sensor observations to smog disaster forecasting, ANNs with single hidden layer or two hidden layers achieve a little higher performance than random forest and support vector machine. In recent years, ANNs are further extended with deep architectures. They have been proven to work very well for many complex prediction problems with big data in the fields like computer version, nature language processing and so on [29]. These theoretical properties and real world applications indicate that ANNs are able to approximate the relationship between the smog disaster and its health hazard.",

For example, we find that O3 does not improve the prediction much when it is inputted with the other air pollutions. On the other hand, we should find out important records in time line for each observation. For example, we find that only the current records instead of all the recent records are important for wind speed and wind direction. In contrary, for D-PHI and PHI, both the current records and the records in the past 6 h are useful. In selecting features, a view independent subset searching method is adopted. It does not search all the subsets of the whole feature set (Fa+Fm+Fs+Fh), but finds out proper features from each kind of features individually, which reduce the complexity from 2|Fa|+|Fm|+|Fs|+|Fh| to 2|Fa|+2|Fm|+2|Fs|+2|Fh|. It is reasonable because in our application one kind of features represents one independent view to observe the forecasting target, which means two features from different views will not be highly correlated. Meanwhile, we further decrease the search spacing through testing records of each observation in time line from the current to the past.

This may be because considering retweets and likes enlarges the signal of severe pollution and health hazard, thus reducing the noise in learning the nonlinear relationships. Especially, the number of retweets and likes to smog-related tweets becomes larger in extreme weather days when it is either severely polluted or has good air quality. It is confirmed by our statistical analysis to the retweet and like records. When compared with the + when AQI ranges from 50 to 200, the days when AQI exceeds 300 have 38% more highly retweeted or liked tweets (more than 40 retweets or likes), and the days when AQI is less than 50 have 12% more highly retweeted or liked tweets.",
