            "text": "Our approach is based on two building blocks. First, we contribute to the literature in epidemiology by studying perceptions and individual behavior in the face of a home confinement policy to prevent the influenza epidemics. Understanding people\u2019s behavior is necessary to define health policy. Indeed, as discussed in [37], individual behavior within society determines the impact of the epidemic. An individual who does not want to comply with preventive measures would become more and more dangerous to themselves and the rest of society. Therefore, it is necessary to determine in advance individual reactions when deciding on public health policy. The literature lacks data on how individuals will behave in the face of a home confinement policy during an influenza epidemic. This article is the first to fill this gap. We use a stated preference method. Kroes and Sheldon [19] and Louviere et al. [22] present and develop the use of this method in diverse fields. We then conduct a questionnaire to elicit the preferences of individuals. In the questionnaire, we place respondents in a hypothetical context in which an epidemic has been reported. We put them in different situations: first, they have been in contact with at least one infected person; second, they have been in contact with at least one infected person and medical assistance is provided during home confinement; third, they have not been in contact with infected persons. For each situation, we ask them to choose the maximum number of days they will be willing to stay at home. In fact, asking for the number of days, as opposed to asking directly whether the respondent would comply with home confinement is a way to evaluate the duration that the respondents would voluntarily be willing to stay at home by removing the efficiency aspect of the sanitary measure. Thus, it avoids a deviation of behavior if this measure was to be applied in case of epidemics. From respondents\u2019 answers, we elicit the proportion of respondents who are willing to comply with home confinement, which is people who have answered a number of days equal to or higher than 7 days. We find that more than three-quarters of respondents would comply with home confinement. Deciding to be willing to comply with home confinement during an influenza epidemic depends on an individual\u2019s characteristics (age, income, composition of the household and professional group), the interaction one can have with an infected person (meeting or not), and the conditions of home confinement (medical assistance or not), but not on having real experience of preventive measures. We discuss the different behaviors that emerge from this study, such as sensitivity to certainty, egoism and altruism.",

            "text": "Second, our paper is linked to the literature dealing with cost\u2013benefit analysis of infectious disease prevention measures. Many studies have been conducted on the impact of a disease using a cost\u2013benefit study. For example, [1] use a cost\u2013benefit analysis to study the financial impact of combating a respiratory virus epidemic in a teaching hospital. Gupta et al. [12] and Mubayi et al. [28] focus on an emerging infectious disease, SARS and compare the costs of different quarantine strategies. However, [2] is the only study that estimated the cost of influenza in France, but its evaluation only concerned the impact on influenza spread of school and public transport closure policies. Focusing on the economic impact of the home confinement policy on influenza is therefore new in economic literature. We try to recognize, identify, evaluate, measure and value the costs of influenza and home confinement in France. We use detailed data on the prevalence, the incidence of the disease and the incidence rate from the French GPs Sentinelles network.5 These data have the particularity of proposing age groups (children, adults and the elderly), which is very useful given that influenza does not affect people in the same way according to age. However, building a mathematical model on the reduction of the influenza incidence with a home confinement policy in force is difficult largely because of the small amount of occurrences in France and therefore the shortage of data. Because of the difficulties in calculating realistic estimates of the reduction of influenza incidence due to home confinement, we focus on the incidence reduction threshold from which home confinement is cost-effective. We find that the measure of home confinement would be a prevention track not to be dismissed. By comparing our results with the existing literature (Longini et al. [21], and Haber et al. [13], which have done stochastic simulation models of influenza epidemics in other countries) and the stated method approach, we see that this measure would be cost-effective.",

Moreover, the constant genetic changes in influenza viruses require that the composition of the vaccine be adjusted every year. Indeed, the vaccine for influenza has a low efficacy due to the variability of influenza strains. WHO decides in February on the composition of the vaccine to be used in the October vaccination campaign. Then, the vaccine is manufactured according to the circulating strains, but some strains can mutate.

This method allows us to analyze the choices stated by individuals to express individual behavior in relation to a given situation. A questionnaire has been drawn up in which, as an introduction to the respondent, we explain that home confinement consists of staying at home with contact only with the members of one\u2019s household and the the characteristics of pandemic flu (symptoms, duration...). We then place the respondent in a hypothetical situation in which an epidemic has been reported and they have been in contact with an infected person (CH Contact). We then ask them to choose the maximum number of days they will be willing to confine themselves to home, i.e., staying at home without outside contact. We ask them the same question by adding the intervention of medical assistance, which is the visit of a health-care professional who verifies the state of health of the respondent during home confinement (CH HWV). This situation allows us to highlight the effect of medical follow-up. We then ask them the same question one last time, modifying the initial situation by the fact that they have not been in contact with the infected persons (CH No contact). This situation allows us to analyze the impact of the risk of contamination on the decision of the respondent. In fact, asking for the number of days, not directly whether the respondent would comply with home confinement, that is, staying home for 7 days, is a way to avoid the anchorage bias. This makes it possible to evaluate the duration that respondents would voluntarily be willing to stay at home by removing the efficiency aspect of the sanitary measure. Thus, it avoids a deviation of behavior if this measure was to be applied in case of epidemics.

We observe that the respondents\u2019 decisions are different according to the situations. Indeed, more adults indicate compliance with home confinement when a health professional visits them during home confinement. Medical assistance is the assurance to be taken care of in case of development of the disease. Having a medical follow-up can reassure the respondents about the conditions of their confinement and therefore create an incentive to comply. Moreover, more elderly persons indicate compliance with home confinement when they have not been in contact with a contaminated person. The elderly verify the certainty effect of [16]. They prefer to eliminate risk rather than reduce it. The elderly are sensitive to certainty. Finally, selfish behavior by respondents is highlighted. Altruistic behavior would mean that an individual who is more likely to become contaminated, and thereby contaminate others, decides to confine themselves to their home to avoid contact with others. In our study, being in contact with an infected person makes respondents (adults and elderly) less likely to confine than not to be in contact. Thus, if the individual risk of being contaminated and therefore of contaminating others is higher, the proportion of respondents in agreement with confinement is lower. This indicates selfish behavior on the part of the respondents.",

For children, the cost is divided between a medical cost (otitis media, pneumonia, hospitalization), the loss of human capital, the loss of parent productivity and the death of children cost. The medical cost is the lowest because the probability that influenza degenerates into otitis media and pneumonia is low. However, the loss of human capital represents a high cost.17 We take the same assumptions as [2], but we update the results with more recent data. We assume that sick children miss school for 3 days implying a reduction of about 0.8 percent of their human capital in that year. We assume a return to schooling of 5 percent per year. The net present value of earnings over the life cycle (42 years) is calculated with an annual discount factor equal to 0.95. We consider individuals to live 15 years in retirement. This yields a loss of 92.88 euros per influenza episode. As a child cannot supervise himself, an adult (most often the mother) has to be at home during their illness. This creates a loss of productivity based on the median female income, weighted by the labor market participation of women. This induces a large cost of 95.70 euros. We then use the value of a statistical life (VSL) which quantifies the benefit for the society of avoiding a fatality. Empirical literature evaluates the VSL between 1.3 and 7.5 million euros [3, 29, 36]. We then use this range of values for our study. For the death rate, we have taken the average death rate from 2005 to 2014 for children. It is very low, about 1.71 per 100,000.18\n",

For evaluating the cost of death, we adopt the same method as for the children. We get a low risk of death around 4.82 per 100,000. Then, we add medical costs for GP visit and hospitalization.

Research on the cost\u2013benefit analysis of prevention measures for infectious diseases has considered different types of cost measures including costs to society, costs to individuals [8], quality-of-life measures [30], etc. In general, costs can be divided into direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are all expenditures for continuing care, health-care providers, certain household expenditures (meal and delivery, home energy), hospitalization and personal wage employed for the sanitary measures. Indirect cost is the productivity loss cost due to the absence of the individual to work, the productivity loss cost due to the closure or the lack of frequentation of a public place and the cost of death.

Building a mathematical model on the reduction of the influenza incidence with home confinement prevention in France is difficult largely because of the very few occurred cases in France and therefore the shortage of data.27 In fact, only two cases occurred when at the end of December 2016, residents (66 people) of a retirement home in Moselle (Northeast France) and a retirement home (80 people) in Saint-Gengoux-le-National (Center-East France) were confined to reduce the spread of influenza. Because of the difficulties in calculating realistic estimates of the rate reduction in the incidence due to home confinement, we propose to evaluate the rate reduction threshold in the incidence due to home confinement for which the home confinement policy is cost-effective. We then calculate this threshold, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\bar{1-r_{\\mathrm{Conf}}}$$\\end{document}1-rConf\u00af when all the age class are differentiated, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\bar{1-r_{\\mathrm{Conf}}^{\\mathrm{All}}}$$\\end{document}1-rConfAll\u00af for all aggregated population, such that \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$C_{\\mathrm{Conf}}=C_{\\mathrm{Influ}}$$\\end{document}CConf=CInflu and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$C_{\\mathrm{Conf}}^{i}=C_{\\mathrm{Influ}}^{i}$$\\end{document}CConfi=CInflui, respectively.

Therefore, based on cost\u2013benefit analysis, to implement home confinement, health decision-makers will be more inclined to be less demanding about the level of reduction in the impact of this measure when the benefit to society of avoiding death is high. On the other hand, the more the measure is respected by more individuals, the more the level of reduction required will be high. We then observe that the increased costs of the measure linked to the medical assistance during home confinement must be offset by an increase in the rate of incidence reduction for the measure to be cost-effective. Finally, we note that the rate reduction threshold of incidence is higher when we differentiate age class than when we consider the aggregated population. Thus, by not differentiating by age classes, the public decision-maker may consider that the measure is cost-effective, whereas it is not when differentiation is taken into account. This shows the interest of considering age classes in a study on influenza epidemics.",

The rate reduction threshold of incidence varies between 65.88 and 84.13% with differentiated age classes, and between 49.24 and 65.05% with the aggregated population. According to the existing studies carried out in other countries, we observe that a 10% increase in the proportion of people who comply with home confinement strongly increases the incidence reduction rate. For instance, from [13], when 70% of people comply with the measure, the reduction rate is 83% while it is 91% with 80% of people complying. In our stated approach, we find that the level of home confinement stated by respondents is between 75.90 and 94.44%. Hence, taking into account the existing studies, we can estimate that in France, home confinement would be cost-effective regardless of the pandemic severity level and the VSL value.",

We first probe perceptions and attitudes toward complying with home confinement in France. We conclude that knowing the level of voluntary participation for this type of measure is essential. This measure cannot be implemented if the population decides not to participate. It would seem inconceivable to assign a police officer to each person detected as infected to verify that they comply with confinement.

Deciding to be willing to comply with home confinement during an influenza epidemic depends on an individual\u2019s characteristics (age, income, household composition and professional group), the interaction with an infected person (meeting or not), and the conditions of home confinement (medical assistance or not). However, having real experience of preventive measures does not factor significantly in the decision to comply or not. Moreover, we highlight selfish behavior by respondents. When they are more likely to become contaminated and thereby contaminate others, they are less willing to comply with home confinement. However, this behavior may also be explained by a certainty bias that pushes people to believe that they are taking all necessary measures to avoid contamination. Finally, we also observe that respondents may behave altruistically when dealing with their own family. Indeed, not staying home during an epidemic limits the risk of contamination of next of kin, especially in large families.",

We find that taking into account age may sharpen the analysis. According to the VSL value and the proportion of people who comply with confinement, we assess the level of the incidence reduction rate threshold for which the measure is cost-effective. No epidemiological study has examined or estimated the reduction in influenza incidence following the implementation of home confinement in France. However, estimates from studies in other countries converge to very close values. From our stated method approach and from the existing studies, this allows us to estimate that in France, the home confinement policy would be cost-effective regardless of the pandemic severity. However, the epidemiological model would be useful for determining the exact impact of home confinement in France. We expect that our study will trigger additional research in this direction. Moreover, as influenza epidemics know no borders, it would also be interesting for this work to be extended to other countries. Indeed, our study can easily be replicated in other regions or countries.",

Second, the data collection method could be discussed. We used an online study. Online studies save time and effort in collecting data [7, 9, 24] and provide better quality responses with fewer \u201cDo not know\u201d answers [11, 15, 18].
