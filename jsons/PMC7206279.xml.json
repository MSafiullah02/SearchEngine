For selection processes (such as hiring or student intake), for instance, the applicants submit general information in the initial stages, such as resumes. The evaluator screens trough the resumes and selects applicants to move on to the next round. In each following stage, applicants are filtered out until the final pool is selected. In terms of information, the initial stages have general data about the applicants and for each subsequent round, more and specific information is gathered. As the process continues, the cost to acquire and evaluate new data increases, which is an incentive to decrease the pool of applicants. Hence, in the final stages, the evaluator has a smaller pool with much more information about each applicant.",

During the initial stages, the number of applicants decreases whereas the data about them increases. Therefore, the dataset grows in dimensionality but decreases in terms of sample size. Classifiers trained in initial stages have sufficiently large samples to generalize, but the available features might not contain enough information to differentiate applicants, causing high bias and underfitting. In the final stages, there is more information for each applicant, but the sample size is reduced significantly, causing classifiers to suffer from high variance and overfitting.

The main contributions of this paper are: We adapted an adversarial auto-encoder to perform data imputation and generate a complete dataset to be shared in different stages.We redesign the multi-stage problem and present a temporal multi-task semi-supervised framework that allows knowledge from all stages to be shared.The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by extensive longitudinal experiments on real data from 3 different selection processes. Our model is able to outperform other single-task and multi-task frameworks particularly in the later stages where the sample size is significantly reduced.\n",

Such methods can be categorized in discriminative [14], or generative [16]. Missing data is a special case of noisy input and deep architectures such as denoising autoencoders (DAE) [16] have performed well due to their capability to automatically learn latent representations. The work presented in [5] uses an overcomplete DAE as a base model to create a multiple imputation framework, which simulates multiple predictions by initializing the model with random weights at each run. Our AAE component is based on the framework proposed in [19], which explores the generative adversarial network (GAN) [6] approach to create: a generator to accurately impute missing data; a discriminator to distinguish between observed and imputed components; and a hint mechanism to help generate samples according to the true underlying data distribution.",

This can increase the sample size for each task, making MTL beneficial for tasks with small training sample. MTL has been applied in different approaches including neural nets (NN) and kernel methods [1, 7]. More recent methods have explored the application of MTL to deep neural nets (DNN) [11]. The regularization parameters in MTL control how information is shared between tasks and prevents overfitting. The framework proposed in [7] enables information to be selectively shared across tasks by placing a structure constrain on the learned weights. Our framework builds on [21], in which temporal information is encoded using regularization terms. MTL can also be combined with semi-supervised learning (SSL) to create classifiers coupled by a joint prior distribution over the parameters of all classifiers [4].",

In terms of stages, it is clear from the right figure that algorithms can perform well while there is enough data to generalize. However, in later stages, there is a drop in performance caused by the small sample size. Algorithms based on AAE-MTL-SSL perform significantly better than others. They achieved a gain of 4x compared to the best standard case (SVM) for later stages. Additionally, our method outperforms the second best with a 12% gain.",

This process contains more longitudinal data (6 semesters), which makes our model more robust to changes across years. Additionally, the number of applicants is more evenly distributed and more applicants reach the final stages, which causes the average performance to be more similar across all stages. In other words, the drop in performance is less steep for later stages compared to \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$C_1$$\\end{document}.

We also introduced a temporal regularization on the model to use information from different stages but still conserve the temporal structure of the process. By combining MTL and SSL, our method can outperform other STL and SL methods. Our validation includes real-world data and our method is able to achieve a gain of 4x over the standard case and a 12% improvement over the second best method. For future research, we want to introduce interpretability techniques to understand the profiles learned by the model and investigate the effect of bias.
