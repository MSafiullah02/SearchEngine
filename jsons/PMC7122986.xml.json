            "text": "From the very beginning of the clinical use of plasma-derived protin concentrates severe noninfectious adverse events (AEs) and transmission of pathogens by plasma-derived protein concentrates were threats to recipients (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-68038-5_10 for additional information). First anti-infectious plasma potein concentrates were the \u201cstandard IgG\u201d preparations. They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception to the above: noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001). Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s, together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease, clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products. Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities. This in turn resulted in a paradigm shift how the modern plasma industry operates (Steinhardt 1998).",

Therefore, modern fractionation of human plasma for clinical use is embedded in a tight network of quality assurance (QA) put in place by recommendation of authorities. Good manufacturing practice (GMP) is part of a QA program (Slopecki et al. 2007). GMP is a guidance for industry. GMP ensures consistency in production. It describes the minimal requirement a product must fulfill for obtaining a marketing authorization and covers procedures for receipt of materials, production, packaging, labeling, quality control, release, storage, and distribution. The procedures and laws of GMP are defined by each country. GMP is a \u201cmoving target\u201d and current GMP (cGMP) includes the most recent developments and knowledge of the field; as technology and information capabilities change, so do the requirements for maintaining good manufacturing practices. On a solid fundament of GMP, the elements for a state-of-the-art plasm product are:Good clinical practice (GCP).Good laboratory practice (GLP).Standard operation procedures (SOPs).Training of staff.Donor selection, deferral and inventory hold.Mass screening of donation for infection markers by serology and nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) testing. Recently one company added isoagglutinin titer screening in plasma donations in order to obtain plasma pools for chromatographic fractionation low in isoagglutinins anti-A and anti-B (Siani et al. 2014).In-process controls (production parameters and infection markers).Validation studies (manufacturing steps and dedicated pathogen reduction).Polishing steps (clinical tolerability and pathogen reduction).Labeling and shipment.Cleaning and segregation.Look back.Pharmacovigilance.Audits by internal and external inspectors.\n",

Such studies are based on the principle of deliberate contamination of the intermediate product by model viruses at given stages of the manufacturing process and monitoring the reduction in infectivity produced by the production step under consideration.\u201d At the time when GMP was introduced, well-established fractionation procedures were in place. For validation studies, the processes had to be downscaled to a laboratory scale. In a first step, it had to be demonstrated that the scaled-down process mimics the process in production, i.e., ideally has identical process parameters. Furthermore, authorities request at least two \u201cdedicated\u201d virus removal/inactivation steps in sequence during the fractionation. The two methods should represent two different principles of action thereby assuring that virus reduction is complementary.",

There are two types of donations: whole blood from which plasma is collected after centrifugation (recovered plasma) or plasma obtained by apheresis device (apheresis or source plasma) (Table 12.1). There is epic, for several decades\u2019 ongoing debate which of the two ways of plasma collection is of higher ethical and better biological quality. There is no reason to step into this discussion in this book chapter. However, it has to be acknowledged that apheresis plasma collection of volumes at the upper end of what is allowed might have an influence on protein composition of the donated plasma (Laub et al. 2010). As GMP covers minimal requirements for quality, and because having been accused remunerated donations being of lesser quality and safety, the apheresis plasma collecting and fractionating industry has introduced additional voluntary regulations. These are the International Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) introducing qualified donor standard, implementation of a donor deferral registry, and a drug abuse screening and the Quality Standards of Excellence, Assurance, and Leadership (QSEAL). QSEAL covers control on incoming plasma, inventory hold, NAT testing, intermediates purchased form external suppliers, recovered plasma specification, qualified donor, and viral markers (http://www.pptaglobal.org/safety-quality/standards/qseal; accessed June 2017). With the implementation of these voluntary standards, no relevant differences are found in pathogen marker frequencies of either type of plasma donation (EMEA 2002). In summary, the main goal of donor selection is to ensure that donors with high risk are excluded form donating, or their donation is withheld from further processing (Table 12.2). The donor is informed if HIV positive.\n\n",

Indeed, transmission of PrPSc has been reported in three symptomatic and one non-symptomatic cases of non-leukocyte-depleted red blood cell concentrates (Hewitt et al. 2006; Peden et al. 2004). Measures to eliminate possibly contaminating PrPSc during plasma fractionation became mandatory. It is accepted that inactivation of PrPSc is not possible without destruction of the biological activity of a plasma product. Hence, elimination by partitioning or exclusion by size remains the two possibilities (Cai et al. 2002). Validation studies were performed at different manufacturers\u2019 site with different spikes and different detection systems. The manufacturing steps studied for removal capacity of PrPSc included precipitation, adsorption, chromatography, and filtration, as well as combined steps. They proved to be highly potent in removal of the TSE agents possibly contaminating plasma (Cai et al. 2013). Reduction by individual steps in sequence was additive (Table 12.12). Furthermore, the declining incidence of vCJD, the stringent donor selection due to geographic donor deferral policy, and the additive nature of removal steps render the agent of vCJD unlikely to be transmitted by plasma products. Indeed, no proven transmission of vCJD by IgG concentrates was ever reported (Ritchie et al. 2016), even not when the administration of a possibly PrPSc contaminated IgG concentrate occurred (El-Shanawany et al. 2009). Ascertained transmission by other plasma products has not been described neither.\n",

This layer, which is also termed \u201chydration shell\u201d or \u201chydration sphere,\u201d keeps the IgG molecules in solution (Makarov et al. 2002). In dehydrated products, e.g., oxidation of the preparation is largely prevented, and aggregation or dimer formation is suppressed. Hence, the excipient only to a part serves stabilization of a freeze-dried product, while its major role is to make sure the lyophilized protein can be reconstituted entirely within reasonable time (no aggregates remaining). The compounds that can be injected intravenously with the best physicochemical properties to simulate water are sugars followed by some amino acids. Although associated with osmotic nephrosis in patients at risk, several lyophilized products containing sucrose are still on some markets (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-68038-5_13).",

Typically NaOH or sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) are used for plant sanitation after a run and at appropriate concentrations are sufficient to destroy virus infectivity. However, how about the TSE agent of vCJD? It needed a particular effort to show that there are sanitation measures that can destroy the TSE agent PrPSc. PrPres served this purpose (Table 12.13). The validation strategy was to show that PrPres after NaOH/NaClO exposure becomes on one hand noninfectious and on the other hand sensitive to proteinase K digestion. NaOH and NaClO treatment both destroy PrPres even at low NaOH and NaClO concentrations. Regulatory agencies consider current cleaning regimes adequate to assure batch-to-batch segregation.\n",

Significant acute hepatitis can be the result of chronic HEV infection in immune compromised patients (Motte et al. 2012), while in immunocompetent patients, HEV infection has been associated to neurological complications \ncHuman parvovirus B19 \nd\nCJD = Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; aberrantly folded prion proteins (PrPSc) are considered to be the infectious agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases, sCJD sporadic CJD, vCJD variant CJD \neReports on transfusion, solid organ transplantation, or sexually transmitted ZIKV disease are available (Barjas-Castro et al. 2016; Nogueira et al. 2017; Venturi et al. 2016). Prenatal infection is associated with microcephaly, while infection in adults can be fatal or be associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or severe thrombocytopenia \nfThe transmission by non-leukocyte depleted erythrocyte concentrates might represent a risk for transmission. Four possible transmission events by non-leukocyte-depleted erythrocyte concentrates have been reported. In one case of probable transmission, the most likely route of infection was by contaminated plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate \ngIn May 2017 a report on two patients receiving blood-clotting factor concentrates dying form sCJD was posted electronically (Urwin et al. 2017). A causal link between the treatment with plasma products and the development of sCJD has not been established",
