A given animal often has multiple medicinal uses and can be employed to treat more than one ailment, while different species of reptiles and amphibians can likewise be used to treat the same illnesses. Products derived from Tupinambis merianae and T. teguixin, for instance, are indicated for treating 8 and 18 conditions, respectively, in Brazil ; in India, products derived from the land monitor (V. bengalensis) are used to treat hemorrhoids, rheumatism, body pain, and burns, as well as spider and snake bites (Kakati et al. 2006) ; in Mexico, rattlesnake pills have been indicated for curing a wide variety of ailments, including: skin blotches, cancer, sores, rashes, pimples, welts, itching, rheumatism, varicose veins, face blotches, acne, blackheads, stress, heart disease, diabetes, hemorrhoids, and sexual impotence (Rubio 1998 ). Reptiles are one of the groups most closely associated with the history of medicine.

According to these medieval manuscripts, these reptiles were successfully used to treat ailments that included sexual impotence and leprosy. Among the species mentioned were indigenous species still found in Azerbaijan, such as the Caucasian agama (Agama caucasica), the Levantine viper (Vipera lebetina), the Mediterranean tortoise (Testudo graeca), and the Moorish gecko (Tarentola mauritanica). Exotic reptiles mentioned included the chameleon (Chameleo chameleo), the monitor lizard (Varanus griseus), and the crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus). The medicines prepared from these reptiles were imported into Azerbaijan from distant countries. The medicinal use of amphibians is also very old. Gomes et al. (2007) pointed out that in many ancient cultures, amphibians were believed to possess medicinal properties. For instance, frog potions are used as aphrodisiacs and to prevent impotence and infertility; they are also used as contraceptives and to treat various illnesses (Gomes et al. 2007 ). Fever could be treated with ground frog heads (Hendricks 1966, p. 44) , and whooping cough with a soup made from nine frogs (Hendricks 1980, p. 109) . Heart trouble was treated with ground-up toad skins (Hendricks 1980, p. 8) . Also, newts are often burned to ashes and then used in medicinal formulas and concoctions since ancient times (Gomes et al. 2007 ). Alakbarli (2006) , highlighted that amphibians were not used in medicine as widely as reptiles, but mentioned that four species of amphibians described in medieval sources have been identified. This group includes frogs, toads, salamanders, and tree-frogs (Hyla arborea).",

Reptiles and amphibians are commonly used in healing through the magical transfer of disease, one of the most engaging subjects in the whole field of folk medicine (Hand 1980) . In some situations, it is believed that the mere contact with an animal is sufficient for the disease to pass from the victim to the animal. In Ontario, for example, the mere touching of a live frog to a goiter is sufficient to make the malady pass into the frog; however, final curing depends upon burying the hapless critter head down in the ground until it decays. When this happens the goiter will disappear. Tying or binding a live frog to the affected part will cure a felon, will cause chills to go out of the patient into the frog, will cure asthma, and, in a North Carolina example, spells resembling the hard ague. In the Blue Grass country a live toad is bound to the back to cure rheumatism, the pain passing from the back of the sufferer into the toad (Hand 1980) . In Northeast Brazil, jabutis (Chelonoidis carbonaria) are usually bred as pets because it is believed that they protect the household from acquiring asthma .",

These observations are corroborated by Brasil (1937) and Giorgi et al. (1993) , who noted that analgesic drugs have been extracted from the venom of Crotalus durissus. Batroxobin, extracted from the venom of Bothrops atrox, has been found to have significant therapeutic effects on ischemic-reperfused rats in vivo and in clinical trials, and batroxobin, as well as ancrod, is currently being commercially produced. Three other thrombin-like enzyme preparations are also commercially available: reptilase, crotalase, and an enzyme derived from Agkistrodon contortrix (Bell and Markland 1997) . However, wider clinical use of thrombin-like enzymes has been impeded by immunologic reactions in patients, limited availability of snake venoms, and high production costs as well (Warkentin 1998) .",

In several Brazilian cities, for example, snakes are widely traded in outdoor markets (that can even have designated stalls for medicinal animals and plants) or in small stores specifically dedicated to this activity (Alves and Pereira Filho 2007; Alves and Rosa 2010) . In Mexico, natural and traditional remedies derived from reptiles (such as dried rattlesnakes, rattlesnake pills, and rattles) are frequently offered for sale (Fitzgerald et al. 2004 ). Turtles, snakes, and lizards (especially monitor and gecko lizards- Fig. 7 .4) are widely hunted and traded in Vietnam for food and as traditional medicines (Jenkins 1995; Le and Broad 1995; Nash 1997; Stuart 2004) . Somaweera and Somaweera (2010) documented the use and trade of snakes in snake wine in four of the most touristic cities in Vietnam. He and Peng (1999) reported that the quantity of snakes consumed in the markets of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province of China, was about 1.4 9 10 7 kg each year. From 1990 to 1995, the annual demand for wild snakes from 13 factories producing traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) included 1,656.77 kg of Zaocys dhumnades, 234.75 kg of Deinagkistrodon acutus, and 20,300 heads and 32.1 kg of Bungarus multicinctus (Zheng and Zhang 2000) . These examples illustrate the urgent need to increase our knowledge concerning the harvesting and trading of reptiles in traditional medicine and to assess the impacts caused by this commercial exploitation.",

Asia has a high diversity of turtle species, but its unique fauna is facing a perilous and uncertain future. The main reason for the Asian turtle survival crisis is Chinese demand for turtle products (van Dijk et al. 2000) . Directly or indirectly, the medicinal value attributed to chelonians has been one of the main reasons for their trade and overexploitation. In China, turtles are sought as a delicacy because of widespread popular belief, inspired by Traditional Chinese Medicine, that turtle meat or shell possesses especially nutritious or curative properties (Lau and Shi 2000) . Such situations demonstrate that cultural aspect should be taken into consideration in the elaboration of conservation plans. A study conducted in China showed that the same (or better) nutritional benefits of turtles can be obtained with cheaper, common, and less-endangered food sources such as domestic animals (Rubio 1998) . These authors concluded that given the financial and environmental cost of using turtle products, other options for obtaining the same nutrition should be promoted and that future challenges should involve balancing cultural practices with sustaining biodiversity.",

Managed harvests of crocodilians began about three decades ago to assist the recovery of species and populations that had been devastated by unregulated hunting. The success of managed harvests and captive rearing in Papua New Guinea, Venezuela, and a few other countries stimulated other governments to begin similar programs. These managed species have shown remarkable resilience in many countries, and their populations are no longer endangered. However, with more countries producing skins, supply began to exceed demand and was followed by a declining popularity of crocodilian leather (Vitt and Caldwell 2009 ).",

Thus, not only should one consider the use of these animals in popular medicine but also their exploitation by the pharmaceutical industry.

As recorded in this work, medicinal use of the herpetofauna, despite being widely disseminated, has been studied little, limiting the evaluation of the impact of these practices on animal populations.
