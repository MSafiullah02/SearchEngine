Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on healthrelated quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). OBJECTIVE: To identify factors impacting the health-relatedquality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to homebased immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/ depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL. \u00d3 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the INTRODUCTION An pandemic caused by a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has recently become the focus of scientific attention. 1 Humanity is exceptionally susceptible as reported by the World Health Organization. 2 The clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe a Regional Reference Centre for Primary Immune Deficiencies, Azienda Universitaria Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy b disease with high mortality rate. Immune-competent individuals might clear the infection, whereas this might not happen in patients affected by primary and secondary immune deficiencies. The vast majority of patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs) might be protected only by avoiding personal contacts because they have reduced number and/or dysfunction in switched memory B cells producing high-affinity antibodies. [3] [4] [5] [6] As a consequence, since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, 7 to minimize the risk of infection, we shifted all patients with PADs attending our centers to home therapy and we activated a service of remote visits. To evaluate the impact of (1) the COVID-19 epidemic and (2) the switch from in-person visits to remote visits on the quality of life (QOL) of patients attending our primary immunodeficiency reference centers, we administered 2 questionnaires, the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life (CVID_QoL) questionnaire, a specific tool to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), 8 and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), a generic tool able to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. 9 Both questionnaires were administered 4 weeks after the identification of the first Italian patient with COVID-19.",

Questions associated with risk for anxiety/depression were related to the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic and to PAD fragility: to be afraid to get infected, to get sick, to be a sick person, to be tired, and to be weak (Table III) . Questions concerning the clinical conditions associated with CVID such as cough, diarrhea, diet problems, and joints pain appeared to be not relevant for the risk of anxiety/depression (Table IV) . Questions on replacement therapy were not relevant regardless of whether patients switched from hospital therapy to home therapy or being constantly on home therapy: \"I was afraid of adverse reactions to immunoglobulin therapy\"; \"Immunoglobulin therapy bothered me.\" Surprisingly, about 58% of patients with PADs were not at risk for anxiety/depression. The analysis of CVID_QoL questionnaire identifies similar items (\"I was afraid my health might worsen,\" \"I was afraid of getting sick,\" \"I felt weak,\" \"I was afraid that I might get infected with other's people illness,\" \"I felt tired\"), even if the percentage of patients responding \"often/always\" to each item had a lower frequency (P < .0001, for the items listed). Other items including \"I felt I was a sick person,\" \"I was concerned about my future,\" \"I was afraid of dying,\" \"I was afraid I might make others sick with my infections,\" \"I felt less independent than usual,\" and \"It was difficult to carry out my usual leisure activities\" received a response \"often/always\" from less than 10% of patients not at risk of anxiety/depression. Also in this group, questions related to clinical conditions such as cough, diarrhea, diet problems, and joints pain had a frequency of \"often/always\" responses from less than 5% of patients and none reported concerns on items related to the immunoglobulin therapy.",

We have previously reported a poor HRQOL in patients with PADs by generic instruments, short-form-36 and GHQ-12, and by the CVID_QoL questionnaire, a disease-specific instrument. 8 We demonstrated that HRQOL was lower than that reported in generally healthy population and that reported in patients with other chronic disease entities. 11 Moreover, we showed that more than one-third of patients were at risk of anxiety/depression at all observation times, a percentage that reached two-thirds of patients, considering only the group of females. Disorders such as anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent in hospital settings and still often go unrecognized. Indeed, we suggested that a comprehensive evaluation of HRQOL assessment should be performed in each patient to document the outcomes of any relevant changes. This is especially true in times of major trouble such as the one being brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, patients affected by inborn errors of immunity 12 are known to be more vulnerable to infections. Among them, patients with PADs lack antibodies that are important to block microbial infectivity and prevent diseases. The protective role of antibodies in other pandemics was reflected in the severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and H1N1, when convalescent plasma containing antibodies from patients who recovered from viral infections was used for treatment at the early stage of disease. [13] [14] [15] Here, we reported data of a study conducted since the beginning of the epidemic in Italy on the possible and expected changes in the HRQOL between patients with PADs living in an Italian region with a high prevalence of COVID-19 and in an Italian region with a lower prevalence. 16 All data were compared with HRQOL scores detected in the same group of patients in 2017, 3 years before the COVID-19 epidemic. The aim of the study was to detect changes in the HRQOL of patients with PADs due to COVID-19 and due to the change in care strategy we adopted. The latter began in late February 2020 by activating the transfer of all patients to home therapy and by activating a remote assistance service as a tool to contain the spread of the infection, to stop travel and exposure, and to permit uninterrupted care of established patients. 17 After completing the transfer to home and activating the remote assistance service, 18 we sent the HRQOL questionnaires. We had a high rate of responders. One of 3 patients reported a worsening in GHQ-12 assessment, being at risk of anxiety/depression. However, the Data are expressed as percentage of patients at risk of anxiety/depression who answered \"often/always\" to a given question (difference between 2020 and 2017 surveys).",

Items that did not affect the GHQ-positive status were related to concerns about the CVID itself such as cough, diarrhea, diet problems, and joints pain, all problems previously identified 9,11 as major drivers of poor QOL in our patients.
