Resilience may be framed as the capacity to bounce back to a state of normality (Holling, 1973), or as an emergent property, when an organization learns to adjust to adversity and in the process, strengthens its capability to overcome future challenges (Wildavsky, 1988). Leadership is critical in an organizational crisis and is often conceptualized as the process of exercising social influence (Mumford, Freidrich, Caughron, & Byrne, 2007). Besides mounting an effective operational response to an organizational crisis, leaders must also fulfil a symbolic need for direction and guidance from its members (Boin, Kuipers, & Overdijk, 2013).",

While Singapore was the fifth most severely affected country in terms of deaths (Tai, 2006), it managed to contain the SARS virus within 2 months. The rapid containment of the disease has been attributed to leadership in the government and within the hospital where SARS victims were cared for, as well as the resilience of healthcare workers in the hospital. Indeed, Singapore's response to the SARS crisis received praise from international health experts and agencies, with a spokesperson from the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention saying, \u201cI can't think of anything that Singapore could have done better\u201d (Khalik, 2003).",

It is premised on three key pillars: organizations as networked structures, leaders as embedded actors with social influence within these networks, and resilience as the process of developing relational networks that allow the organization to adapt and restore function.",

The metaphor of resilience as a material that can absorb strain and maintain its shape often comes to mind when conceptualizing resilience as a characteristic (Walker & Salt, 2006); resilience is the \u201cability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance\u201d (Holling, 1973: 14). In the second approach, resilience emerges in response to setbacks and develops over time from continual exposure to hazards and crises (Wildavsky, 1988). Resilience is framed as a form of learning, where an organization not only survives via positive adjustment to current adversity, but in the process strengthens its capability to overcome future challenges.",

Healthcare organizations are a prime example of institutions that deal constantly with crises, continuously facing the possibility that \u201ctheir first error may be their last trial\u201d (Rochlin, 1999: 1552). The uncertainty brought on by virulent epidemics and other emerging communicable diseases is exacerbated in today's interconnected world of global air travel. For example, the Ebola outbreak that first struck Guinea in March 2014 had, by August, grown into an international public health emergency, with a global death toll of over 11,000 to date (World Health Organization, 2016).",

In addition to financial, structural or technological resources, Doerfel et al. (2010) point to social capital\u2014resources embedded and available in social relationships\u2014and communication networks as an important source that can facilitate organizational recovery after adversity. Unlike human capital that is dependent on individual capabilities, social capital is embodied in relationships (Coleman, 1990), and encompasses structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). While structural social capital refers to connections between individuals, relational social capital involves the nature of those connections (e.g. trust), and cognitive social capital is based on the understanding between partners about common language and shared goals. In an analysis of organizational recovery after Hurricane Katrina, it was observed that social capital became a primary recovery source and that relational resources could be renewed, restored and even created when no prior relationships existed (Doerfel et al., 2010).",

Social network theory posits interaction patterns among people as the basis for networks (Blau, 1977). Organizations may be seen as social networks of individuals, and situated in a network setting with other organizations. During a crisis, existing networks and their communication channels are drastically altered. The breakdown in existing social structures triggers the development of transitional networks, which aid in the acquisition and sharing of resources through coordinated action. As the organizations move through recovery phases, membership in these transitional networks evolve, and eventually stabilize as communication and routines are re\u2010established, and the organization enters a \u201cnew normal.\u201d Crisis is thus seen as a turning point in the organizational lifecycle, and transitional networks as the temporary social structures that organizations weave to successfully evolve through the crisis, to reach full organizational functioning.",

As a result, crises are often associated with the need to dramatically change prior practice, to move away from stability to new goals, and also imply a time\u2010pressured change from normal practices. The rush to make important decisions and execute change presumes that leadership is critical in a crisis, and indeed, Pearson and Clair (1998) have stressed the importance of leadership in organizational crisis. In analysing the role of crisis leaders, Boin et al. (2013) have offered a comprehensive framework to assess the work that crisis leaders must do, based on five key tasks: sensemaking to process information from environmental cues to promote a collective understanding of the crisis, decision\u2010making and facilitating effective coordination among various parties, meaning\u2010making to provide an interpretation of the situation and to bring authentic hope and confidence to stakeholders (Leonard & Howitt, 2009), rendering accountability to satisfy legal and moral requirements and to restore trust in the organization, and facilitating reflection and learning from the crisis.",

Sensemaking is recursive: actions taken in response to sensemaking in turn enact the environment that people seek to understand (Maitlis, 2005).

Leaders\u2019 sensemaking has been implicated in strategic change (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991), by influencing organizational members to make changes in their own practices, and to co\u2010construct work that is consistent with the vision. Sensemaking by leaders is also important for organizational learning: Christianson, Farkas, Sutcliffe, and Weick (2009) found that after the roof at the B&O Museum collapsed onto a priceless collection, leaders\u2019 sensemaking helped reduce ambiguity, prompted understanding of the organization's weaknesses and facilitated opportunities for organizational transformation.

Secondly, the stakes were especially high for TTSH, as it was designated as the sole hospital in Singapore to deal with SARS. The Emergency Department, the busiest in Singapore, was shut and concentrated on screening patients for SARS. Elective treatments were cancelled, and inpatient admissions for non\u2010SARS\u2010related cases were curtailed (Chua, 2004). Staff in TTSH had to care for dangerously ill, highly infectious patients while themselves risking infection.

An example of how leaders empathized with team members was when a clinical leader admitted to his intensive care unit team members that, not knowing how the disease spread, he could not guarantee they would survive the crisis. However, all of them would face the risks together:(There were) people who asked, what guarantee did they have? No guarantee! But I'm here. We're all in this together, we're all in the same boat.

First, the focus of the model is on how leaders use relational connections to promote organizational resilience, and thus, we have not explored if leaders activate organizational resilience via other means. Second, while providing a basic heuristic on how senior leaders may engage social connections as a source of organizational resilience, it does not offer an exhaustive conceptualization of the subject. Lastly, we have illustrated elements of the model with one case in a healthcare context and cannot claim generalizability across other organizational contexts; for example, we do not know if this would be applicable to junior levels of leadership. Each of these limitations, however, may be considered directions for future work. Additionally, it would be instructive to investigate the relative contributions of each element to resilience.",

In this paper, we sought to link the two concepts, by asking: How do leaders utilize social relationships to activate resilience in a crisis? The RAR model builds upon resilience and leadership literatures and provides a conceptual framework that explicates the critical role of leadership in activating resilience during crisis situations, through a relational network perspective. Using the case study of a Singapore hospital during the SARS crisis, we demonstrated how leaders can leverage upon their social influence to harness cognitive, social, and emotional reservoirs inherent within social networks, to activate organizational recovery. The RAR model builds on Powley's (2009) work by showing that leadership plays a key role in bringing about liminal suspension through signalling changes in routines and procedure. It also links the theory of transitional networks with leadership activities and highlights the role of mutual trust and swift trust in establishing different types of relational connections during crisis. Future studies could be directed at achieving a more sophisticated understanding of how leadership behaviour influences relationships and hence organizational resilience during crisis.",
