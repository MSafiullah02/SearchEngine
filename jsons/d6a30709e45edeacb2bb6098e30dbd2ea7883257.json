They also discuss the reasons why in different scenarios anti-IL6R may have either positive or negative effects on survival in severe viral infection. Evidence for the importance of this cytokine in recovery from viral infections has been demonstrated using IL-6-deficient mice. In such instances, IL-6 appears to be required for promotion of T cell responses together with tissue remodelling and repair [3] . However, there is also evidence (summarized by Velazquez et al. [3] ) that increased expression of IL-6 during anti-viral immune responses may promote viral persistence, partly through impairment of the lytic activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

There is evidence to suggest that reduced expression or impaired functionality of perforin is associated with increased severity of symptoms (Cunningham et al. submitted for publication). It is also of interest that patients with a predisposition to perforin dysfunction ('perforinopathies') are also prone to 'cytokine storm' [1, 4] thereby the death of virally-infected cells [5] . Studies in mice revealed that increased levels of IL-6 were associated with reduced natural killer (NK) cell function specifically associated with reduced expression of perforin and granzyme B. Moreover, exposure of human peripheral blood NK cells to IL-6 also resulted in reduced expression of these effector molecules [5] .",
