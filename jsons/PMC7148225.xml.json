However, such features are extracted from each source independently, without considering interactions. In particular, previous approaches do not take into account the customer review evaluating process. A customer\u2019s perception of helpful information of a review is affected by the sentiment of the review and what the customer already knows about the product. Before reading a review text for a product, the customer is very likely to be aware of background information such as star rating, product attributes, etc. When a customer reads a review with a lower star rating, he may hold a negative opinion towards the item at first and mainly look into those aspects of the review supporting the lower star rating. Although review sentiment has been previously explored [7, 15, 17], previous work has not used review sentiment to identify useful information from review text. Moreover, the customer likely has some preconceptions of the product features they are most interested in. With these expectations in mind, the customer pays special attention to those aspects of the review text that they find most salient. There have been earlier efforts [4, 6, 13] at capturing useful information from a review by considering product information. However, the unique aspects of each product (different levels of importance of attributes, evaluation standard, etc.) were not fully identified in those efforts.",

The main contributions are summarized as follows:To our knowledge, we are the first to propose that customers may have different expectations for reviews that express different sentiments. We design a sentiment attention layer to model sentiment-driven changes in user focus on a review.We propose a novel product attention layer. The purpose of this layer is to automatically identify the important product-related attributes from reviews. This layer fuses information not only from related products, but also from the specific product.We evaluate the performance of our model on two real-world data sets: the Amazon data set and the Yelp data set. We consider two application scenarios: cold start and warm start. In the cold start scenario, our proposed model demonstrates an AUC improvement of 5.4% and 1.5% on Amazon and Yelp data sets, respectively, when compared to the state of the art model. We also validate the effectiveness of each of the attention layers of our proposed model in cold start and warm start scenarios.\n",

However, previous research has not taken into account differences in customer expectations that can result from review sentiment perception. With respect to product information, Fan et al. [4] tried to better represent the salient information in reviews by considering the metadata information (title, categories) of the target product. However, this information can be quite similar for products of the same type, so the unique aspects of each product (different degrees of importance of attributes, evaluation standard, etc.) can not be fully captured from reviews. Wu et al. [26] presented an architecture similar to the one we propose here. However, the design of the sentiment attention layer and product attention layer in our architecture is different from their attention layers. Moreover, their architecture is intended for classifying review sentiment.",

In contrast, for the category AC4 (Grocery & Gourmet Food), the improvement is only 0.3%. We note that the category AC4, has less data than most of other categories (Table 1). Only the category AC8 (Pet Supplies) contains fewer products and reviews. However, there are proportionally more reviews per product for the category AC8 than for the category AC4.

Finally, HSAPA refers to the complete model which implements both attention layers.

By adding a product attention layer (HPA) to the base model (HBiLSTM), the improvement is 0.7% and 1.3% on the Amazon and Yelp data sets respectively. Combining all three components results in an even larger increase in AUC score, 3.4% and 4.8%, respectively on the Amazon and Yelp data sets. We observe a synergistic effect resulting from the addition of the two attention layers. We also note that in both data sets, the improvement from the product attention layer is lower than that from the sentiment attention layer.

For example, for the category Grocery in the Amazon data set, the number of parameters of the complete model HSAPA is 30,194,490. We increased the number of hidden units in the other three models to create new models with approximately the same number of parameters HBiLSTM: 30,420,604, HSA: 30,424,204, HPA: 30,412,858. Recall that the selection of hyper-parameters was determined by using a grid-search of the hyper-parameter space. Not surprisingly, the new models with more parameters do not demonstrate an improvement in performance in comparison to the models with hyper-parameters determined by grid-search. Our proposed model demonstrates improved performance, not simply because of greater modelling power due to more parameters, but because of the leveraging of sentiment and product related information by the sentiment and product attention layers.\n\n\n",

Tables 6 and 7 show that, on average, the addition of the sentiment layer (HSA) to the base model increases the AUC by 1.8% and 2.7% on Yelp and Amazon data sets, respectively. We also find that the addition of the product attention layer (HPA) to the base model increases the AUC by 3.8% and 5.5% on Yelp and Amazon data sets, respectively. Comparing the results from warm start scenario to cold start Scenario, we make the following observations. First, the average performance of the base model (HBiLSTM) is very similar in both scenarios. Second, the AUC improvement from the product attention layer (HPA) is higher than that from the sentiment attention layer (HSA) on both data sets in the warm start scenario. This improvement is not seen in the case of the cold start scenario. In the cold start scenario the product embedding can only be learned from reviews of related products. In contrast, in the warm start scenario product information can be learned from both the target product and related products. This explains why the product attention layer can achieve better performance in warm start compared to cold start scenario. From the performance results described in the cold start scenario section (Tables 3 and 4), we see that HSAPA out-performs the other models. We also see that HSAPA has even better performance in the warm start scenario (Tables 6 and 7). In practice, one can expect a mix of cold and warm start scenarios where HSAPA can be expected to demonstrate superior performance than in cold start scenario.\n",

We use two colors: red and green to represent the sentiment attention scores and product attention scores respectively. The lightness/darkness of the color is proportional to the magnitude of the attention score. There are a few interesting patterns to note. First, for the sentiment attention layer, the words that are assigned large weights have sentiment that is close to the overall sentiment of the review. For instance, in the example 2 the overall sentiment of the review is positive (5 out of 5). Although there are several negative words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d, the positive words/phrases like \u201cgreat\u201d, \u201cremain sharp\u201d are still assigned higher attention weights. This observation is consistent with our previous hypothesis that the word importance in a review can be affected by review sentiment. Second, the attributes or descriptive words of an attribute of the product in a review text gain higher weights from the product attention layer. For instance, in the first example the descriptive words \u201cfit\u201d, \u201cenough\u201d and the noun \u201ctub\u201d are assigned relatively high attention scores. Third, the combination of the important words captured by two attention layers can give us a brief and thorough summary of a review. It may also visually explain why the combination of these two can achieve a better result compared to a single attention layer.",

We also describe the results of our experiments in two application scenarios: cold start and warm start. In the cold start scenario, our results show that the proposed model outperforms PRH-Net, the previous state of the art model. The increase in performance, measured by AUC, as compared with PRH-Net is 5.4% and 1.5% on Amazon and Yelp data sets, respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of each attention layer of proposed model in both scenarios. Both attention layers contribute to the improvement in performance. In the warm start scenario, the product attention layer is able to attain better performance than in cold scenario since it has access to reviews for targeted products. In this work, we evaluate review helpfulness from the perspective of review quality. For future work, we may rank the helpfulness of reviews by incorporating a user\u2019s own preferences [22] in order to make personalized recommendations.",
