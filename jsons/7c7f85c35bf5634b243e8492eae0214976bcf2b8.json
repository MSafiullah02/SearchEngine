Its 2 pathogenic potential and vector specificity have not been well defined. SPONV has been 3 found predominantly in Africa, but was recently detected in a pool of Culex quinquefasciatus 4 mosquitoes in Haiti. Here we show that SPONV can cause significant fetal harm, including 5 demise, comparable to ZIKV, in a mouse model of vertical transmission. Following maternal 6 inoculation, we detected infectious SPONV in placentas and fetuses, along with significant 7 fetal and placental histopathology, together suggesting vertical transmission. To test vector 8 competence, we exposed Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes to SPONV-9 infected bloodmeals. Aedes aegypti could efficiently transmit SPONV, whereas Culex 10 quinquefasciatus could not. Our results suggest that SPONV has the same features that 11 made ZIKV a public health risk. 12",

Serum was collected at 2, 4, and 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) to 91 confirm infection and determine the replication kinetics of SPONV in nonpregnant Ifnar1 -/-92 mice. We also collected and tested serum at 7, 14, and 21 days from mice surviving SPONV 93 inoculation, because sustained vRNA loads were observed with the Ifnar1-blocking mAb 94 model (Salazar et al., 2019) . SPONV viral titer in the serum peaked at 4 dpi (Fig. 1a) , and in 95 surviving animals there was no detectable viremia at 7, 14, or 21 dpi. Higher serum titers 96 were observed in animals inoculated with the lowest dose of SPONV (10 2 PFU). We 97 postulate that this could be the result of higher inoculating doses causing a rapid initial rise 98 in viremia, which in turn induces a more robust immune response, leading to more rapid 99 clearance of virus from the serum, but confirmation will require further studies. ZIKV-DAK 100 viremia also peaked at 4 dpi and reached significantly higher titers at 4 dpi than either 101 PFU of SPONV or 10 2 PFU ZIKV-DAK. Based on our preliminary experiments with SPONV in 120 nonpregnant animals, and the results from our past studies (Jaeger et al., 2019), we chose 121 this dose to minimize the potential confounding impacts of maternal illness on fetal 122 outcomes. We collected serum samples from dams at 2 and 4 dpi to confirm maternal 123 infection. All dams were productively infected, with detectable viremia for all groups by 4 124 dpi (Fig. 2a) .

We considered these doses to be 241 physiologically relevant based on studies with DENV (50% mosquito infectious doses = 242 10 5.68 -10 7.21 viral cDNA copies/ml) (Duong et al., 2015) and ZIKV (50% mosquito infectious 243 doses = 10 6.1 -10 7.5 PFU/ml) (Ciota et al., 2017) .

The potential of SPONV to emerge 261 and cause congenital infections in humans as ZIKV did depends on its capacity for vertical 262 transmission in mammals and its ability to be transmitted by human-preferring mosquitoes 263 like Ae. aegypti. To date, only limited attempts have been made to evaluate its pathogenic 264 potential and identify potential vector mosquitoes, e.g., (Haddow et al., 2016; McDonald et 265 al., 2017; Salazar et al., 2019).

Our results demonstrated that maternal infection of Ifnar1 -/dams with SPONV 271 caused significant fetal harm and is consistent with ZIKV infections in this same model. 272 Importantly, we confirmed that outcomes were specific to SPONV and ZIKV infection, 273 because we observed no fetal harm in dams infected with DENV-2. Although there are 274 limitations regarding the translational relevance of this model, this same mouse platform-275 coincident with epidemiological data (Rasmussen et al., 2016) and other lines of evidence-276 is widely regarded as helping to establish a direct causal link between ZIKV and fetal 277 abnormalities in 2016 (Miner et al., 2016). In the less severely immunocompromised anti-278 Ifnar1 mAb model of pregnancy, we show that although ZIKV and SPONV do not cause fetal 279 demise, maternal infection still results in vertical transmission of virus. These results are 280 consistent with prior studies using the anti-Ifnar1 mAb model to study ZIKV pathogenesis 281 during pregnancy (Miner et al., 2016; Sapparapu et al., 2016; Jagger et al., 2019). Together 282 our data show that infection with SPONV during pregnancy can lead to fetal harm, with 283 varying levels of damage to maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. We therefore speculate 284 that SPONV infection during pregnancy in humans poses a risk to the developing neonate, 285 and suggest that clinicians in areas endemic for Ae. aegypti caring for non-ZIKV adverse SPONV could follow in the path of other Ae. aegypti-transmitted arboviruses, because of 288 our data demonstrating that Ae. aegypti-which also transmits DENV, ZIKV, yellow fever 289 virus, and chikungunya virus-could transmit SPONV. Ae. aegypti is a highly domesticated 290 urban mosquito that lives in close proximity to humans, feeds on humans, and lays eggs in 291 containers made by humans (Gubler, 2011). As a result, Ae. aegypti thrives in conditions 292 created by high population density in tropical cities and thus facilitates epidemic arbovirus 293 transmission. 294 In this study we found that SPONV infection of nonpregnant Ifnar1 -/mice was nearly 295 uniformly lethal. This finding mirrors observations from other studies using AG129 mice, 296 which lack both type I and II interferon receptors (McDonald et al., 2017), and mice treated 297 with an anti-Ifnar1 mAb to transiently abrogate type I interferon signaling (Salazar et al., 298 2019). Pregnant animals that received this anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment prior to SPONV 299 inoculation showed infection of the placenta and fetus, suggesting vertical transmission, but 300 not increased rates of fetal resorption, recapitulating and expanding on the results reported 301 from Salazar et al. by including a 2mg mAb dose and ZIKV infection groups (Salazar et al., 302 2019). In contrast, SPONV-inoculated Ifnar1 -/dams had significant rates of fetal resorption study, consistent with ZIKV-inoculated controls and with what we and others have reported 305 previously for ZIKV in this model (Miner et al., 2016; Yockey et al., 2018; Jaeger et al., 2019). 306",

For example, 308 anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment is systemic and therefore may not dampen type I IFN signalling 309 in the placenta, whereas Ifnar1 -/dams have a more profound immune deficiency that 310 manifests different tissue-specific effects (Yockey et al., 2018). Future investigation into the 311 role of both timing and dose of anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment during fetal and placental 312 development could help further illuminate these immune mechanisms during SPONV and 313 ZIKV infection. 314 Differences observed in fetal outcomes and histopathology across ZIKV and SPONV murine 315 pregnancy models may also be due to the use of a different virus strain, dose, or mouse 316 platform. It should be noted, however, that our Ifnar1 -/mice are on the same genetic 317 background as our anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated mice: C57BL/6, therefore differences in outcome 318 are not likely to be due to variation in host loci outside the IFNAR1 gene. The SA Ar94 319 strain used here was also used in previous mouse studies (McDonald et al., 2017; Salazar et biologically important, phenotypic differences. Regardless of these potential disparities in 322 experimental approaches, broadly consistent results have been observed using these murine 323 pregnancy models for ZIKV, including fetal harm and vertical transmission. 324 Despite similar fetal outcomes, SPONV and ZIKV may not necessarily utilize the same 325 pathways or molecular mechanisms to harm the fetus.

            "text": "330 heterogeneous and severity scores were reminiscent of what we have previously observed 331 with congenital Asian-lineage ZIKV infection (Jaeger et al., 2019). The labyrinth zones of 332 both ZIKV and SPONV placentas showed similar degrees of vascular injury/loss, such that, 333 despite this heterogeneity, the final outcome of fetal demise did not differ between these 334 two viruses. While SPONV fetal histopathology in the CNS and developing brain, as well as 335 the detection of virus in fetal tissues, provide indirect evidence of vertical transmission, this 336 does not preclude the possibility that SPONV-induced fetal harm was the result of placental 337 and for ZIKV, placental insufficiency is now being recognized as a potential contributor to 339 fetal harm (Hirsch et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2019). As a result, SPONV could still cause 340 adverse pregnancy outcomes in the absence of direct infection of the fetus via 341 pathophysiology at the maternal-fetal interface. Importantly, we only assessed outcomes 342 following a single infection timepoint at E7.5 and infection outcomes may differ depending 343 on the timing of infection (Jagger et al., 2017). More studies are needed to better 344 understand antiviral signaling at the maternal-fetal interface and pathways these viruses 345 exploit to traffic to the feto-placental unit to cause harm during pregnancies. Translational 346 nonhuman primate models will be valuable for such studies. 347 SPONV's ability to spread and broadly infect new human populations depends on the 348 mosquito vector that transmits it. One recent study suggested that strains of Ae. aegypti, 349 Ae. albopictus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus were refractory to SPONV infection (Haddow et al., 350 2016). However, the blood on which mosquitoes fed in these experiments harbored 351 moderate SPONV infectivity of ~10 5 PFU/ml. For related arboviruses like DENV, it is known 352 that the level of viremia is one of the most important determinants of human infectiousness 353 to mosquitoes (Nguyet et al., 2013; Carrington and Simmons, 2014). ZIKV 50% mosquito then bloodmeal titers of ~10 5 PFU/ml are too low to achieve mosquito infection. In addition, 356 some studies have shown that freeze-thawing flaviviruses impacts mosquito infection and 357 transmission rates (Miller, 1987; Ciota et al., 2017). As a result, we chose a virus dose that we 358estimated to be what a mosquito might encounter in nature based on previous studies with 359 DENV and ZIKV (Duong et al., 2015; Ciota et al., 2017), the flaviviruses most closely related 360 to SPONV. In addition, we prepared our infectious bloodmeals using fresh virus supernatant 361 to avoid the confounding effects of freeze-thawing virus stocks. These experiments 362 demonstrated that Ae. aegypti could be productively infected and could transmit SPONV-363 as indicated by infectious virus in the saliva, suggesting the ability to transmit to a 364 vertebrate host. In contrast, Cx. quinquefasciatus were susceptible to infection but none of 365 these infected mosquitoes were capable of transmitting virus by day 14 post-feeding. These 366 data therefore suggest that the wild-caught Haiti mosquitoes likely contained trace amounts 367 of viremic blood in their midguts indicating that they fed upon a SPONV-infected human or 368 animal. Further, the Haiti data also are consistent with field epidemiological reports for 369 which it has been difficult to detect DENV-, CHIKV-, and/or ZIKV-infected mosquitoes 370 because of low infection rates in field-collected mosquitoes, even during periods of active Finally, we used only a single combination of mosquito and virus genotype. Vector 373 competence of many mosquito species for certain viruses likely is governed by vector 374 genotype x virus genotype interactions in genetically diverse, natural mosquito populations 375 (reviewed in (Lambrechts, 2011)). These data at the very least argue for more studies-both 376 experimental and epidemiological-assessing different SPONV-mosquito combinations. 377 Together, our data show that SPONV possesses worrisome properties that should prompt 378 further investigation into its epidemic potential and risk to pregnant women. The current 379 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic underscores that RNA viruses can emerge 380 unpredictably to cause human disease on a global scale. Characterizing viruses with 381 potential emergence risk is a critical part of defending against future viral threats 382 (Menachery et al., 2015; Goodin et al., 2016). The adaptation of SPONV to an urban or peri-383 urban cycle, involving Ae. aegypti and/or other mosquitoes in the Stegomyia subgenus (e.g., 384Ae. albopictus) should therefore be a public health concern (Musso et al., 2015). Given the 385 continuing difficulties in differentiating between flaviviruses in diagnostic assays, 386 understanding SPONV's prevalence in the expanding landscape of cross-reacting, co-387 endemic mosquito-borne viruses could also be considered a critical public health priority.388 Ethical Approval 390 This study was approved by the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Institutional Animal 391 Care and Use Committee (Protocol Number 1804-35828). 392 Cells and viruses 393 African Green Monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC #CCL-81) were maintained in Dulbecco's 394 modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, 395 Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml 396 of streptomycin, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Aedes albopictus mosquito cells (C6/36; 397 ATCC #CRL-1660) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 398 (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/ml 399 penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin, and incubated at 28\u00b0C in 5% CO2. The cell lines were 400 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were not further authenticated, and 401 were not specifically tested for mycoplasma. 402 ZIKV strain DAK AR 41524 (ZIKV-DAK; GenBank:KY348860) was originally isolated from 403 Aedes africanus mosquitoes in Senegal in 1984, with a round of amplification on Aedes 404 pseudocutellaris cells, followed by amplification on C6/36 cells, followed by two rounds of SA Ar94 (GenBank: KX227370) was originally isolated from a Mansonia uniformis mosquito 407 in Lake Simbu, Natal, South Africa in 1955, with five rounds of amplification with unknown 408 culture conditions followed by a single round of amplification on Vero cells. Virus stocks 409 were prepared by inoculation onto a confluent monolayer of C6/36 mosquito cells. DENV-2 410 strain BID-V594 (GenBank:EU482725), originally isolated from a human in Puerto Rico in 411 2006 with a single round of amplification on C6/36 cells, was obtained from BEI Resources 412 (Manassas, VA). BEI amplified the virus on C6/36 cells and virus stocks were prepared by 413 inoculation onto a confluent monolayer of C6/36 mosquito cells. We deep sequenced our 414 virus stocks to verify the expected origin (see next section for details). The SPONV, ZIKV-415 DAK, and DENV-2 stocks matched the GenBank sequences (MG182017, KY348860, 416 EU482725, respectively) of the parental viruses; but a single nucleotide position in the 3' 417 UTR (site 10,603) of the DENV-2 stock contained a 79/21 ratio of T-to-A nucleotide 418 substitutions and a variant at site 3710 in the ZIKV-DAK stock encodes a nonsynonymous 419 change (A to V) in NS2A. 420 Deep Sequencing deep sequenced by preparing libraries of fragmented double-stranded cDNA using methods 423 similar to those previously described (Lauck et al., 2013). Briefly, the sample was centrifuged 424 at 5000 rcf for five minutes. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter. Viral 425 RNA was isolated using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), 426 omitting carrier RNA. Eluted vRNA was then treated with DNAse I. Double-stranded DNA 427 was prepared with the Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, 428 Carlsbad, CA) and priming with random hexamers. Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Beckman 429 Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) were used to purify double-stranded DNA. The purified DNA was 430 fragmented with the Nextera XT kit (Illumina, Madison, WI), tagged with Illumina-compatible 431 primers, and then purified with Agencourt Ampure XP beads. Purified libraries were then 432 sequenced with 2 x 300 bp kits on an Illumina MiSeq. 433 Sequence Analysis 434 Viral stock sequences were analyzed using a modified version of the viral-ngs workflow 435 developed by the Broad Institute (http://viral-ngs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/description.html) 436 implemented in DNANexus and using bbmap local alignment in Geneious Pro (Biomatters, 437 Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Briefly, using the viral-ngs workflow, host-derived reads that 438 remaining reads were loaded into Geneious Pro and mapped to NCBI Genbank Zika 440 (GenBank:KX601166), Spondweni (Genbank:MG182017), or dengue virus (GenBank:EU482725) 441 reference sequences using bbmap local alignment. Mapped reads were aligned using 442 Geneious global alignment and the consensus sequence was used for intra sample variant 443 calling. Variants were called that fit the following conditions: have a minimum p-value of 444 10e-60, a minimum strand bias of 10e-5 when exceeding 65% bias, and were 445 nonsynonymous. 446 Plaque assay 447 All ZIKV and SPONV screens from mouse tissue and titrations for virus quantification from 448 virus stocks were completed by plaque assay on Vero cell cultures. Duplicate wells were 449 infected with 0.1 ml aliquots from serial 10 -fold dilutions in growth media and virus was 450 adsorbed for one hour. Following incubation, the inoculum was removed, and monolayers 451 were overlaid with 3 ml containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% oxoid agar and 2X DMEM (Gibco, 452 Carlsbad, CA) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were 453 incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for four days for plaque development for ZIKV and five days 454 for SPONV. Cell monolayers then were stained with 3 ml of overlay containing a 1:1 mixture and 0.33% neutral red (Gibco). Cells were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C RNA was extracted from sera using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Kit (Promega, 460 Madison, WI) on a Maxwell 48 RSC instrument (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA was then 461 quantified using quantitative RT-PCR. Viral load data from serum are expressed as vRNA 462 copies/mL. Viral load data from tissues are expressed as vRNA copies/tissue. 463 Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (QRT-PCR) 464 For DENV-2, vRNA from serum was quantified by QRT-PCR using the following primers: 465 Forward: CAGATCTCTGATGAAYAACCAACG Reverse: AGTYGACACGCGGTTTCTCT Probe: 6-466 Fam-CGCGTTTCAGCATATTGAA-BHQ1. IUPAC nucleotide codes are as follows: Y: C or T; B: C 467 or G or T; R: A or G. The RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step 468 Quantitative RT-PCR system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on a LightCycler 480 instrument 469 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The primers and probe were used at final 470 concentrations of 600 nm and 100 nm respectively, along with 150 ng random primers 471 (Promega, Madison, WI). Cycling conditions were as follows: 37\u00b0C for 15 min, 50\u00b0C for 30 RNA concentration was determined by interpolation onto an internal standard curve 474 composed of seven 10-fold serial dilutions of a synthetic DENV-2 RNA fragment based the 475 WHO type strain, New Guinea C that shares ~94% similarity at the nucleotide level to the 476 Puerto Rican strain used in the infections described in this manuscript. 477 Mice 478 Female Ifnar1 -/mice on the C57BL/6 background were bred in the specific pathogen-free 479 animal facilities of the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine. Nonpregnant 480 C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Timed matings between female 481 Ifnar1 -/mice and male C57BL/6 mice resulted in Ifnar1 -/+ progeny. 482 Subcutaneous inoculation 483 Non-pregnant Ifnar1 -/mice were between six and eleven weeks of age. Non-pregnant mice 484 were inoculated in the left hind foot pad with either 10 2 PFU of ZIKV, 10 2 or 10 3 PFU of 485 SPONV, or 7.5 X 10 4 PFU of DENV in 20-25 \u03bcl of sterile PBS. Submandibular blood draws 486 were performed 2, 4, and/or 6 days post inoculation and serum was collected to confirm 487 viremia and compare replication kinetics. 488 assigned to infected and control groups.
