            "text": "Many current molecular biological analyses, especially microarray-based analysis of gene expression, require the efficient design of large numbers of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). In the PCR, the 3\u2032 ends of primers must anneal to templates to be elongated by a DNA polymerase. A high G+C content at the 3\u2032 end of a primer may obviate the need for complete complementarity and annealing of the remainder of the primer sequence, thus diminishing the specificity of the priming reaction [1]. A low G+C content at a primer's 3\u2032 end may, due to weak annealing, increase the importance of complete annealing of the remainder of the primer sequence [2]. On the other hand, such primers may not be elongated efficiently by DNA polymerase [1]. Although the importance of the 3\u2032 end triplet in primer design is recognized, many recommendations for 3\u2032 end triplet selection, based mostly on theory, have been put forth, and some contradict others. Recommended compositions of 3\u2032 ends are: no T at the 3\u2032 end and at least one W (A or T) in the 3\u2032 end triplets [3]; S (C or G) at the 3\u2032 end and no GC or CG, due to potential formation of hairpins and primer-dimers [4]; low G+C [2], [5]; one or two S [6]. One way to test the validity of those recommendations and determine which 3\u2032 end triplets are best suited for PCR primers is to examine the 3\u2032 ends of primers actually used in successful PCR experiments. We here report such an examination.",

Since the primer sequence data set contained 134 BHV-1, 237 BVDV and 121 FMV primers, these viruses were used to test whether genome compositions determined the 3\u2032 end triplet frequencies. Thus, triplet frequencies of the BHV-1 genome (135,382 overlapping triplets) were subtracted from frequencies of 3\u2032 end triplets in BHV specific primers (Fig. 2\n) to yield differential frequencies. The same calculation was performed for BVDV and FMV (12,274 and 7794 overlapping triplets, respectively). In this analysis, a differential frequency of zero would indicate that a primer's triplet frequency is expected from its representation in the genome sequence. Negative values indicate that those triplets were used less frequently in primers than in genome sequences, while positive values indicate more frequent use.",

Since the number of primer sequences for the individual viruses were only two to four times the number of possible triplets, individual differential frequency values cannot be compared statistically.

Focused experiments comprehensively varying 3\u2032 end triplets of primers at a single template site could potentially reveal principles for the choice of 3\u2032 end triplets for the design of efficient primers. However, the outcome of such experiments will likely depend on the sequence context of the varying triplet and on conditions of the PCR experiment.

However, two of eight WSS triplets, ACG and TCG (WCG), were in the bottom half of triplet frequencies seen less frequently in the VirOligo database while the other combinations of WSS appeared in the top dozen. Other applications, such as DS genes (Accelrys), allow the user to choose the 3\u2032 end sequence but have no 3\u2032 end selection in their default settings. According to O'Connell [5], the current trend in programming choices for primers is to ask for low %GC toward the 3\u2032 end. As mentioned above, the VirOligo distribution is not consistent with this recommendation. Thus, it is unlikely that the frequencies of 3\u2032 end triplet observed in primers (Fig. 1) are due primarily to primer design software or literature recommendations.",

The under-representation of WCG, mentioned above, suggests a high frequency of failure of PCRs using primers ending in WCG. Low G+C contents in the 3\u2032 end triplets of PCR primers were not frequently reported in the VirOligo database. Among the existing recommendations, the best performer, when judged by the observed 3\u2032 end triplet frequencies is the one that requires an S at the 3\u2032 end and no GC or CG in the sequence. All but one (AGC) of the top 10 conform to this recommendation and only one (GGG) of the 10 least frequent conforms to the recommendation. Based on our results we would recommend WSS or SWS 3\u2032 ends, but avoiding WCG. However, there are additional exceptions to even this recommendation.
