Hajj [2\u20135] accounts for more than four thousand stampede related deaths in the last twenty-five years [6]. Kumbh Mela [3], to be referred as Kumbh, has also witnessed hundreds of stampede related death in recent times. Surely, these people did not deserve to die in that way.",

Regular crowded events like those of Hajj, Kumbh, Arbaeen [6], Badrinath Yatra [7] are predictable in nature and behaviour, and crowding in them can normally be contained. Irregular events usually occur once or are spontaneous in nature like those of a funeral procession, protest or celebration March, election rally, sporting event or musical concerts. Estimation of the crowd size of an irregular event is very difficult and often impossible. Let us look at some of the irregular gatherings. The funeral of the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini, in Tehran in 1989 was attended by about eleven million people [8]. About four million people gathered for the funeral of the Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum in 1975 [9]. The funeral of Princess Diana [10] in September 1997 had attracted about one million people. More than six million people participated in the Concluding Eucharistic Celebration [11] in Manila by the Pope Francis in January 2015. Three million people marched in February 2003 in the streets of Rome [12] to oppose the invasion of Iraq led by the United States of America. Stanley Cup parade attracted two million people in Philadelphia, USA in 1974 [13].",

However, moving events like parades and processions are relatively easy to manage because of their stretch over a large area. Occurrence of stampedes is normally attributed to overcrowding and mismanagement. Our study of the past stampedes of hajj and Kumbh revealed that the hotspots were cramped places assembly and walkway intersections. A stampede may also quite likely occur due to a sudden or unplanned stoppage of a section of the moving crowd. One may think that the management of regular events is easier. But the statistics [6] point to quite an opposite conclusion as most of the deaths have occurred in the stampedes of the Hajj and Kumbh.",

            "text": "From the historical accounts and statistics, we find that the number of participants in many of recurring and non-recurring events is not controlled to manageable limits, and hence catastrophes occur. For an event to be managed properly, crowds must be limited to acceptable international standard, which unfortunately we do not have. Mismanagement is another major factor for reoccurrence of disasters in large gatherings, as is evident from large number of causalities which we find in the annals of history. An example of gross mismanagement was a stampede which occurred on 13 October 2013, during the Hindu festival of Navratri, on a bridge in Datia district, Madhya Pradesh, India, killing 115 people and injuring more than 110 [14]. Religious nature of some events like Kumbh, the Hajj, Badrinath yatra and similar events prevents many reforms that the management would like to do in order to minimize the chances of stampedes. Political parties refrain from bringing reforms in religiously sensitive issues, which in turn prevent to contain build-up of crowds beyond limits. Participation of unauthorized people in certain events like the Hajj is a destabilizing factor to management. Due to these and some other regional factors, the crowds can swell to limits from very management is rendered ineffective. For example, controlling the number of pilgrims to Kumbh is increasing difficult as there is no requirement of granting permissions to the participants. Also there are no, for taking part in the Kumbh, there are no restrictions on the number of pilgrims. In this situation, only the past can give some estimate of the number of future events. In political rallies, sporting events, concerts, funerals, weddings and many other similar non-recurring events, it is not possible estimate the number of participants. In some situations, these crowds can be violent creating chaos and loss of property and lives. Another example is that of the Hajj in 2012, for which only about two million permits were issued. Apparently, participation by more than one and half million illegal pilgrims was a result of local population living in the Hajj precinct. To minimise the chances of stampedes, drowning, fires, and spread of diseases and, the size of crowds must be restricted to manageable limits. This can only be done by political will and by having a binding international standard for gatherings of people. Organisation of crowded events like Kumbh, Hajj and many other religious and social gatherings around the globe would become relatively easier to manage if political consensus was evolved for by international community to implement a commonly agreed standard for holding crowded events. Fortunately, we technology has advanced tremendously and now it much easier to track crowds and identify individuals and spot hot spots. Let us look at some of the technological tools which can be very useful in managing large crowds.",

It is a gathering of millions of pilgrims in the plains of Arafat involving intense and simultaneous rituals is unique and has no parallel in the world. Many of the hajj rituals are very complex and intense in nature. Data of millions of pilgrims from many countries is collected well before the event takes place and can be organised and mined at any point of time. Hajj rituals are concluded within 5 days but the hajj journey for overseas pilgrims spans over four to 6 weeks. All pilgrims gather in Mina, a tent city close to Mecca, a day before the main ritual of the Hajj. On the day of the main ritual, all pilgrims must travel; using surface transport, to Arafat valley located about 20 km from Mina. Standing and praying in the designated area of Arafat valley during the daylight is the main ritual of Hajj. Official account of the past gatherings in Arafat ranges from two to just under four million people. There have always been thousands of unauthorised pilgrims in the past events. All pilgrims must leave the valley at the sunset and travel to a mountainous place known as Muzdalifah, located between Arafat and Mina. To and fro Arafat journey of all must be completed on the same day. Next day all of these pilgrims must return to Mina and then walk to Jamarat Bridge for first stoning ritual. It was this walk in 2015 which at an intersection in Mina caused the worst stampede of all times killing more than two thousand people [6]. After the stoning, the other rituals which follow include a journey from Mina to Mecca and back, usually on the same day. There are further two stoning rituals during the next 2 days. In the past, these rituals have caused a number of stampedes killing hundreds of pilgrims [6]. More in depth analysis and description of the Hajj and its rituals can be found in [2\u20134].",

To make it successful, the government of Saudi Arabia through the governorate of Mecca and its various ministries has provided state of art infrastructure and facilities to perform the Hajj. However, despite excellent organization, the hajj management, to a large extent, remains manual. With the ongoing technological advances and changing environment, the hajj management should make use of the latest technologies. There are several steps which need to be taken if the hajj management is to take full advantage of these technologies. In particular, the hajj management would need an efficient Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) linking the key functions such as pilgrim checking, tracking, identification, travel, accommodation, health management, crowd movement and so on.",

Fog can be defined as an extension of Cloud to the edge of a network with smaller memory and processing power\u2014it can be any device with an ability to do some computing and storage. Therefore, unlike Clouds, Fog is close to the end user and supports distributed computing model instead of only the central one. More information about Fog can be found from [17]. Here we provide properties of the Fog which differ from Cloud.Fog can be any device has ability to compute and cache data in addition to network. However, Cloud is a set of servers.Support the applications that are sensitive time response and latency as healthy apps, where using Fog makes the latency very low in addition to increasing the response speed and decrease the traffic on the links, while in the Cloud there is big latency.Since the Fog node is near to end user which makes it suitable for performing filtering and processing on data before sending it to the Cloud, that means the overhead on the Cloud will be decreased, and the traffic on the link and network also. So that, it is very useful for big data applications. Ex. Fog can process images and detect features then send these features instead of images to the Cloud. While the Cloud is good for analysing historical or big data.Fog can do some policy on data also before sending it to Cloud and that increases the security, especially for IoT objects not having enough memory and processing power to perform same these tasks.Fog support the mobility apps as smart traffic and manage crowd more than Cloud.Fog increases the availability service comparing to cloud and that very benefit for crowds.Fog nodes can be spread intensity to cover any area fully as Hajj place, so it supports the distributed computing not only central as Cloud.There is limitation in resources of Fog node which these resources unlimited in the Cloud, so Fog computing cannot be instead of Cloud but it can integrate with it.Fog supports awareness location and that not achieved in the Cloud.User can have full control on Fog, while there are three main levels in Cloud (SaaS, Paas, and IaaS).",

Despite dedicated organisation and hard work and a huge investment of human and capital resources, many of the hajj operations and management still remain largely manual. Technological advances and changing requirements warrant hajj management to take the advantage of latest technologies. Indeed there are several steps which need to be initiated to take full advantage of the latest technologies. In particular, the hajj management needs an efficient Management Information System (MIS) to manage its key functions such as pilgrim checking, tracking and identification, pilgrim travel, pilgrim health management, crowd management and so on. Health and hospital management during hajj is an extremely difficult but very important function of the hajj management. It is well known that pressure on health services can become unmanageable during hajj period. Moreover, the lack of information about the pilgrims\u2019 state of health makes it very difficult to administer desirable treatment. Communicable diseases like EBOLA have in recent years created havoc in many countries especially in the West African region. Recent outbreak of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in different parts of world has shattered the myth that the virus is confined to the Middle East only. This has forced many countries, including India, to take preventive measures against the virus finding a home in their countries. Undoubtedly, lack in preventive measures and poor management of these deadly viruses can be devastating. These viruses can easily spread in dense and poorly managed crowds. Every year we have many crowded events take place, most of which happen to be in developing and economically poor counties. For details, see [19\u201324]. We certainly need the technologies and expertise to safeguard the participants against all kinds of threats and disasters. An aim of this article is to propose a framework improve the hajj management for wellbeing of the pilgrims. Our framework advocates the use of latest technologies such as RFID, Mobile Apps, IoT, and Digital Streets. The framework resulting from this project can also be utilized during the Omrah season, especially during the month Ramadan, when the crowding also becomes very intense.",

Also, recent spread of MERS in South Korea was something that has surprised many. Indeed these viruses and bacteria are contagious and can spread very quickly if not checked. Spread of these diseases have affected many educated people and consequently they have refrained from participating in crowded events or have taken due precautions. But the number of participants in regular events like the Hajj and Kumbh hasn\u2019t come down. On the contrary, the number has gone up. It is well known that the participants in crowded events of three or more days duration causes the spread of common flu and other diseases due to unhygienic conditions. Another serious health risk arises from the inability of preventing infected illegal pilgrims from entering events. Due to intense crowding and lack of infrastructure, many a times, it is not feasible to check and process all pilgrims within realistic timeframe. In some crowded events such as the Hajj, there is a mandatory requirement of to be medically fit and hence all pilgrims are required to undergo certain vaccinations and produce certificate of fitness. As for the pilgrims to the Kumbh, there is a requirement of vaccinations but many pilgrims can sneak into the Kumbh without having to undergo medical examination. In most of the non-recurring events, vaccination and medical examination of all the participants is in current situations is impossible. The biometric scans at all the major air and sea ports of Saudi Arabia are capable of identifying people with forged documents. The problem however still remains to check the local pilgrims from Makkah region and prevent unauthorised ones from performing the Hajj. But in case of Kumbh, it is difficult to ensure filter the pilgrims with dangerous viruses into the event as there is no system in place of providing permitted on the basis of full health check-up. Equally difficult is to ensure that the health examinations carried out by health centres are not compromised. Thus there are real possibilities of some pilgrims carrying contagious viruses and diseases into the Hajj and Kumbh. More study of health related issues can be found in [25, 26].",

            "text": "People on their death bed often want to perform religious acts. Very often they want to perform a pilgrimage. Thus, it is almost impossible to prevent such people from doing pilgrimage. In regular events like the Hajj, where prior permissions are granted on the basis of medical and security check-ups, administration may succeed to deny the entry to the infected people. But in non-regular events like rallies and processions, it is not feasible to scrutinise participants. Thus, the event managers must have a framework to deal with sick and infected people to safeguard the health of the participants. On the other hand, in some instances, medical reports can be compromised and infected people may succeed to secure a false certificate of health. These are calls for the organisers of recurring events like Kumbh and the Hajj should seriously revise their policies on sick people and progressively consider allowing them to perform the pilgrimage. For it to be accomplished, the organisers must make special arrangements to segregate the sick, infected and terminally ill people for performing their pilgrimages. In doing so, the sick and infected people will come forward to avail the special facilities instead of hiding in the crowds, as the case presently. One of the key elements for a successful organisations and management of crowded events is to know the kind of participants, and accordingly have definite plans for their management. Having basic knowledge about the health of all pilgrims is essential for a successful management of crowded events. Spread of a communicable disease in a crowded event may have devastating results. However, all of these considerations and concessions shouldn\u2019t apply in cases of diseases like EBOLA which are difficult to contain, until a satisfactory way of preventing their spread is discovered. However, people infected with HIV and Hepatitis viruses are capable of being managed and hence could be allowed under supervision. The management shouldn\u2019t neglect disabled and elderly pilgrims and should make adequate arrangements for their wellbeing during their participation in the event.",
