The risk factors should be stated during the phone appointment.Remote reporting should be considered, when possible, provided that national or local rules are followed.Teleconsultation with patients after radionuclide therapies is strongly encouraged.Establish virtual multidisciplinary meetings.Establish remote communication channels with referring physicians.\n",
