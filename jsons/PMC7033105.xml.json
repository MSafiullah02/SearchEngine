            "text": "Acute aortic syndromes (AASs), which include acute aortic dissection (AAD), intramural aortic hematoma (IMH), penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) and spontaneous aortic rupture (SAR), are severe cardiovascular emergencies affecting 5\u201310 per 100.000 individuals a year1. A conclusive diagnosis of AASs requires advanced aortic imaging, typically computed tomography angiography (CTA), which uses ionizing radiations and may cause contrast-induced nephropathy and anaphylaxis. However, selection of the right patient to image with CTA is cumbersome, because AASs present with unspecific symptoms such as truncal pain, syncope, neurological deficits and hindlimb ischemia. These are leading causes of Emergency Department (ED) visits worldwide, and most patients with these symptoms are affected by more common conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes, gastrointestinal diseases and muscle-skeletal pain. Hence, the misdiagnosis rate of AASs is high, affecting clinical outcomes2\u20134. Increasing use of CTA in EDs has led to a high number of CTA exams requested for suspected AAS turning out negative, but has not substantially changed misdiagnosis rates, indicating that pre-test patient selection remains a key node5\u20137. Development of reliable diagnostic biomarkers discriminating AASs could positively impact on their diagnostic workup, as for other cardiovascular emergencies such as acute coronary syndromes and pulmonary embolism8,9.",

Currently, D-dimer is the only biomarker clinically applicable to the workup of AASs11,12. Owing to high sensitivity, D-dimer can be used for diagnostic rule-out of AASs, if the pre-test probability is sufficiently low13. However, D-dimer can be increased by several conditions such as inflammation, infection, cancer, trauma and age, leading to low diagnostic specificity. On these grounds, the quest for additional diagnostic biomarkers for AASs remains open and vibrant.",

Soluble ST2 (sST2), a truncated form of transmembrane ST2, is secreted into the circulation and functions as a decoy receptor for interleukin-33. Evidence has accumulated that sST2 is up-regulated in cardiac cells upon myocardial strain and several studies have established plasma sST2 as a biomarker for clinical risk prediction in patients affected by heart failure15\u201319. The role of sST2 within vascular tissues and in the context of aortic disease is largely unknown20. However, Wang et al. recently reported that plasma sST2, measured with a research-grade assay, showed striking diagnostic accuracy for AASs and outperformed D-dimer, in a Chinese patient cohort21. Since plasma sST2 levels can be measured with a clinical-grade assay already approved for patient use, we sought to further evaluate it as a diagnostic biomarker for AASs in an independent prospective cohort of acute patients from a European ED.",

Several issues may cause the discrepancy between current and previous data. First, the present study involved a larger case-mix and an elder population, both typical of western country hospitals. Indeed, a recent study has reported significant variation in sST2 levels related to age, with 50 years as a critical cutoff22. Major differences in age between the present and the previous study may account for the discrepancy. Second, male gender has also been associated with higher sST2 levels. However, since gender distribution was similar between the two studies, this should not be regarded as a major confounder. Third, ethnic differences in sST2 levels between Asian and European populations may exist. Indeed, the lowest diagnostic accuracy estimates for D-dimer have been obtained in Asian studies23. Finally, the present study used a different assay for detection of sST2, i.e. the only one approved for patient use24. In Wang et al., the results of the research-grade R&D assay and the clinical-grade Presage assay strongly correlated. In the present study, we also found a significant albeit looser correlation between assays. Technical differences between sST2 assays have already been documented25. However, additional ethinc specific differences between assays are also conceivable.",

Second, due to ethical and clinical considerations (exposure to radiation and contrast medium), CTA could not be performed as uniform gold standard. Treating physicians decided on CTA based on patient-level clinical reasoning irrespective of study participation, in compliance with an observational and non-interventional study protocol. A follow-up approach was used for pragmatic case adjudication based on 30-day outcomes. This method is routinely applied in diagnostic studies of cardiovascular emergencies in the ED such as pulmonary embolism and acute coronary syndromes and has been used in a previous multicenter study of AASs12,28\u201332. As compared to our previous work, the timeline of the follow-up was extended from 14 to 30 days, in order to fully cover both the acute and subacute phases of AASs.

The assay precision assessment was performed according to the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) EP5-A standards. Intra-series coefficient of variation (CVa) and total CVa were 6.5% and 9.1%, respectively, at an average concentration of 16.9 ng/mL, 3.4% and 5.5% at a mean concentration of 33.1 ng/mL, 3.8% and 6.3% at an average concentration of 68.7 ng/mL, 2.4% and 4.8% at an average concentration of 159.1 ng/mL.
