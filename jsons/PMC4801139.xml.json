This data set included information on age, sex, area of residence, the reason the case patient was tested for MERS-CoV, whether the case patient had symptoms that met the case definition suggestive of MERS-CoV at the time of testing, and the case patient's most recently reported clinical status (hospitalized, home isolation, discharged, or deceased) as of July 25, 2014. Line list data were abstracted from multiple sources, including MERS-CoV case report forms (where available), laboratory report forms, and clinical records. Information on comorbid conditions was inconsistently available and therefore was not included in our analysis. We consider persons who had any indication of death, hospitalization, or MERS-CoV symptoms to have developed symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV infection severe enough to warrant testing at some point in their illness (hereafter referred to as \u201csevere\u201d symptoms).",

Within the KSA, active surveillance policies varied between locations and by time over the course of the period examined, and they were often poorly documented. Hence, there is no single protocol or set of criteria that led to individuals being tested for reasons other than having MERS-CoV symptoms. However, from mid-2013 to 2014, there was a general policy of testing home and hospital contacts of index case patients whether or not the contacts had symptoms (10, 11).",

We assumed that infected individuals detected through active surveillance in each age class develop symptoms and die at the same rate as all (i.e., both detected and undetected) individuals infected with MERS-CoV who are the same age (Figure 1). The probability of being detected through passive surveillance is assumed to depend entirely on symptom status, and all cases of MERS-CoV in patients who die before being the infection is otherwise detected are assumed to have been detected by passive surveillance. Case patients without symptoms severe enough to trigger testing still have a small (estimated) probability of their infections being detected by passive surveillance. The probability of a case being detected by active surveillance is assumed to be independent of symptom status.",

However, because our estimates were also based on mortality data, the effect of this mischaracterization should be mitigated. Active surveillance may be more likely to detect case patients infected by known contacts with other infected persons than those infected by dromedary camels. If individuals infected by humans and those infected by camels develop severe symptoms and enter the passive surveillance system at the same rate, this should not bias our estimates; however, it is possible that the route of infection does impact the probability of symptoms (particularly camel-to-human infection that occurs through a route other than the respiratory system).",

Under-reporting of deaths cannot be ruled out, nor can a bias towards reporting more severe cases; both would bias our estimates. We cannot be sure that the mortality rate and symptomatic rate in case patients tested for reasons other than MERS-CoV symptoms are the same as those of infections in general. We further assume 100% sensitivity in laboratory testing, but the true sensitivity may be less and vary over the course of a case patient's illness. We assume that active case finding is independent of the development of symptoms, but it is likely that persons with some symptoms are more likely to be tested than are other contacts of or health care workers who dealt with MERS-CoV\u2013infected patients, particularly after protocol changes in April and May of 2014 (8, 9). Likewise, asymptomatically infected individuals may shed less virus and thus be less likely to test positive for MERS-CoV infection. These biases would lead to an underestimation of the true number of MERS-CoV infections in our model, so our estimated number of total infections is conservative (e.g., if persons with cases detected by active surveillance have twice the odds of developing symptoms or dying compared with cases overall, the true number of MERS-CoV infections would be 1.3 times our estimate; see Supplementary Data).",

As discussed above, our method has limitations that tend to bias estimates of the true number of cases downward; serosurveys in general, and those by M\u00fcller et al. (19) in particular, have their own sets of limitations that may bias estimates upward. In particular, 1) cross-sectional serosurveys do not define a risk period and will pick up exposures that occurred before the current epidemic; 2) serological tests have limited ability to distinguish MERS-CoV from other recent and historic coronaviruses (camel and otherwise) that may be antigenically similar but not cause severe disease in humans; and 3) projections of a low attack rate to the entire population of the KSA may be problematic (as acknowledged by the authors). Given the differing direction of potential biases in serological and case-based approaches, the truth may like somewhere in between the 2 approaches. If truly accurate estimates are desired in the future, serological and active surveillance methods must be implemented with this in mind from the start of the response to an emerging infection, providing the appropriate baselines and consistency in procedure that are needed to have early, precise, and unbiased estimates of the true burden of a disease.

If wrong, these assumptions generally bias the estimated number of infections down; thus, our estimate may be best viewed as a lower limit of the true number of MERS-CoV infections in the KSA.
