Unaware of Schneider's success, Oldfield Thomas (1910) later wrote that 'if an Arctonyx occurs in the . . . mountain districts [of Sumatra], and its characteristics are in any way compatible with Hubrecht's animal, after elimination of the imaginary Edentate attributes, the name hoevenii may have to be used for it.' In their report on an expedition to Mt Kerinci in west Sumatra, Robinson & Kloss (1918) redescribed the Sumatran hog-badger on the basis of newly collected series of skins and skulls deposited at the Raffles Museum in Singapore. In keeping with Thomas' recommendation, they designated a specimen in the Federated Malay States Museum (now the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research) as a neotype for hoevenii to anchor the name's association with the Arctonyx of Sumatra, because Hubrecht had, rather memorably, been unable to secure a type for the original description. Although they used the name Arctonyx collaris hoeveni in the text of their paper, Robinson and Kloss also figured a plate of the species bearing the name 'Arctonyx hoeveni', perhaps betraying their uncertainty regarding the Sumatran hog-badger's degree of taxonomic uniqueness.

Second, it seemed clear from our reading of the literature and our preliminary examinations of museum specimens and their associated data that unlike other Arctonyx, the Sumatran population seems to be truly restricted to montane forests, suggesting an ecological distinction between this disjunct equatorial population and other Arctonyx. Finally, it was immediately clear from initial examinations of museum specimens that Sumatran Arctonyx are morphologically extremely distinctive relative to other Arctonyx, most notably when compared with the geographically nearest population of Arctonyx from southern Thailand.

Within all three Arctonyx species, no measured variable differed significantly between sexes in these comparisons, with a single exception -fully grown female A. collaris skulls averaged significantly larger (P = 0.01) in condylobasal length than males (N = 3 for females, N = 5 for males). However, this last comparison is based on very little data, because most adult and old adult skulls of A. collaris in our dataset (N = 18) are either somewhat broken (such that condylobasal length cannot be measured) or, more frequently, are not explicitly sexed. All three intact female skulls of A. collaris in these comparisons are from Peninsular Thailand, while all five intact male skulls are from India, Myanmar and Laos; thus, the difference between these samples might be attributed as much to locality as to sex. Condylobasal length in A collaris does not differ significantly between males and females when young adults from our dataset (representing more individuals from many other localities) are also pooled in these comparisons. Because there seems to be no clear pattern of sexual dimorphism in the genus, and because world museum samples of Arctonyx are rather limited, we pooled males and females in all morphometric comparisons, but where relevant, have discriminated between young adults on the one hand and adults and old adults on the other.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "MATERIAL AND METHODS"}, {"text": "Initially, our investigations of geographical variation were based on our study of Arctonyx skins and skulls at ANSP, BMNH, FMNH, MCZ, MNHN, RMNH, USNM and ZRC.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "Direct comparisons of skulls from various localities (a wide range of localities, from China to Sumatra, is represented at both BMNH and USNM) and compilation of univariate craniodental measurements provided us with an immediate indication that Sumatran Arctonyx are craniodentally distinctive in being very small, with diagnostically small teeth relative to mainland Asian Arctonyx (Figures 2-6 ). Direct comparisons against mainland animals showed that Sumatran specimens were also distinctive in having relatively elongate rostra and pronounced sagittal cresting (despite their small size).

None of the specimens that we measured fell into the intermediate range of lengths (i.e. 142-150 mm). All specimens from China fell into the smaller size class, and all specimens from Indochina (Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos) fell into the larger size class, while amongst museum specimens from north-eastern India, both size classes were found. These size classes could usually be further distinguished on the basis of qualitative cranial characteristics. Animals in the larger size class usually have a large diastema between the second and third upper premolars (in both the upper and the lower jaws), conspicuously longer than the corresponding gap seen in animals in the smaller size class. Like the much smaller Sumatran animals, skulls from the larger mainland size class also possess a pronounced sagittal crest, lending the skull a more vaulted braincase in lateral profile. Close inspection indicated that the mainland Arctonyx size classes also differed in several external aspects, although these differences are more subtle than the differences in colour that distinguish Sumatran Arctonyx from other populations. Compared with the smaller size class, larger Arctonyx specimens from mainland Asia tend to have sparser and coarser (Table 2) .

Skulls from specimens at AMNH could be sorted using the same metric and qualitative criteria into a larger mainland size class (specimens from India, Laos and Thailand) and a smaller mainland size class (specimens from China). However, the material at AMNH narrowed the distinction in cranial length evident between the two mainland Asian size classes. Two young adult skulls from Fujian Province (AMNH 41475, condylobasal length 148.5 mm, and AMNH 57373, 143.8 mm) are larger than all other skulls referred to the smaller Asian size class, and approach young adult specimens of the larger size class in bivariate comparisons of overall size (Fig. 2) . However, these skulls and their accompanying skins possess the qualitative features of the smaller mainland Arctonyx (lack of a marked premolar diastema, little promise of a marked sagittal crest, long black guard-hairs on the dorsum, heavy white underfur), and we thus classify these with the smaller taxon, with the suggestion that these skulls perhaps approximate the upper limit of cranial size seen in that species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1057, "end": 1065, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "In bivariate comparisons illustrating overall cranial size on the basis of skull length and width, the two mainland Arctonyx taxa do not overlap, while in bivariate comparisons of molar size, the Sumatran Arctonyx population separates clearly from all other Arctonyx (Figs 2, 3) . In a principal components analysis drawing on ten craniodental measurements, these three groupings are essentially discrete, particularly when only adult and old adult skulls are compared (Fig. 4 , Table 2 ). The three taxa diverge along the first principal component, reflecting in particular differences in overall cranial size, and the clusters of both A. hoevenii and A. collaris diverge from A. albogularis also along the second principal component, reflecting in particular their more expansive braincases (in width and height) and smaller molars, in proportional terms. Discriminant function analyses drawing on the same variables provide another means of illuminating these and other morphometric distinctions (Fig. 5 -Scott, 1966; Corbet & Hill, 1992; Wozencraft, 2005) , it was well established in the 19th century naturalist literature of British India that two distinctive kinds of hog-badgers overlapped geographically in the eastern subcontinent. Blyth (1875: 29) correctly diagnosed the two and called them the 'Large Burman sand-badger' and the 'Small Burman sand-badger', noting that 'both appear to have the same geographic range'. Likewise, Blanford (1888) recognized two species of Arctonyx and again emphasized key diagnostic features, such as the much larger skull of one [in his key, he diagnosed the larger as having a skull length > 6 inches (152 mm), the smaller with skull length < 5 inches (127 mm) -anticipating the absolute difference in skull size that we document in this paper between A. collaris and A. albogularis; see below]. Sclater (1891: 290-291 ) also discriminated the two distinct size classes as well, and noted that the distributions of the two kinds in India were 'probably the same'. The possible geographical overlap of two Arctonyx taxa in eastern India was more recently posited by Rakamantha (1994) , who noted during fieldwork in Manipur that 'reliable tribal informants claim that there are two types (subspecies?) of hogbadger within Manipur; the one being the fairly large animal displayed at the Zoo, and the second variety being smaller with dark spots on its body. This needs further investigation.' We suspect that the observations reported by Rakamantha do indeed reflect the local co-occurrence of two kinds of hog-badger in Manipur (as previously noted by Blyth, Blanford and Sclater) , which lies at the juxtaposition of the recorded geographical ranges of the two taxa. The 'dark spots' on the smaller variety mentioned by Rakamantha probably reference the longer, darker guard hairs in the pelage of the smaller taxon, which sometimes clump and bunch, giving way to the underlying white underfur, generating the impression of dark-pale spotting. The original description and accompanying coloured plate of Arctonyx collaris (Fig. 7) published by F. Cuvier (in Geoffroy & Cuvier, 1825) was based on an original drawing by Alfred Duvaucel, which was in turn based on two animals collected in the hill country between Bhutan and India (given as Hindustan), housed in a menagerie at Barrackpole. The two animals on which the plate is based can thus be regarded as the original syntypes; these specimens were apparently never preserved in a museum collection after their death at the menagerie. The extremely thick-set body, massive head, proportionally long tail and pale (rather than predominantly blackish) dorsum of the animal figured in the original plate ( Fig. 7) provide indications that Arctonyx collaris is the original name for the larger Arctonyx species of mainland Asia. In our assessment, the measurement of 'nine inches' (221 mm) quoted by Cuvier for the tail length of one of the syntypes (cf. Table 4 ) and discussion of the animals' coarse fur (F. Cuvier, in Geoffroy & Cuvier, 1825) further confirm these animals' identity with the larger species.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1007, "end": 1020, "text": "-Scott, 1966;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1041, "text": "Corbet & Hill, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1059, "text": "Wozencraft, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1865, "text": "Sclater (1891: 290-291", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2112, "end": 2129, "text": "Rakamantha (1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2626, "text": "Blyth, Blanford and Sclater)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 267, "end": 278, "text": "(Figs 2, 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 469, "end": 476, "text": "(Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 479, "end": 486, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1006, "text": "(Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3069, "end": 3077, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3703, "end": 3710, "text": "Fig. 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3951, "end": 3958, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF10"}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "As noted above, some 19th-century naturalists in British India (Gray, Horsfield, Blyth and Blanford) correctly used the name A. collaris for the larger of the two Indian hog-badgers, and the name A. taxoides, erected by Blyth (1853) , for the smaller badger (diagnosed based on its smaller size and longer fur; isonyx and taraiyensis, manuscript names for the smaller form, also appeared in the British Indian literature; Hodgson, in Horsfield, 1856; Gray, 1863). Pocock (1940 criticized this early view, noting that 'these authors assume, on what evidence I cannot ascertain, that collaris was the name for the larger British Indian Hog-Badger, the most common form to the east of the Bay of Bengal.' Pocock instead used the name collaris for the smaller taxon ('A. c. collaris', in his revision), and introduced the new name A. c. consul for the larger form, based on specimens from Mt Toungoo in modern-day Myanmar (Pocock, 1940) . Pocock's (1941: 429) argument was based on 'geographical reasons'. Although no specimens from the vicinity of Bhutan were available to Pocock (or to us) , he observed that most specimens from that general neighborhood (he cites the type of isonyx from 'Sikkim Terai', a specimen in the Calcutta Museum from Darjeeling and an additional specimen from 'Assam') represent the smaller Indian hogbadger, which, according to Pocock, 'forcibly suggests racial identity between Cuvier's type and the Hog-Badger . . . of the Sikkim Terai.' We disagree with Pocock's attributions. Based on our review of museum specimens and Cuvier's original account, we instead follow earlier authors from British India in using the name Arctonyx collaris for the larger species, noting that both the smaller and the larger forms are known historically from the vicinity of the vague type locality (the border area between Bhutan and India; see Fig. 11 ). Because both taxa are known in the region and there has been considerable historical confusion about the precise identity of Duvaucel's original animals, we consider it profitable to designate a neotype for A. collaris. We have examined only five specimens from the Indian subcontinent representing the larger Arctonyx species (Appendix 2). Of these, only two are adults with a relatively firm locality, represented by both a skin and a skull (BMNH 43.152, young adult female, from 'Naga Hills', 3500 feet [Nagaland State, India]; and AMNH 171170, old adult male, from Nongpoh, Khasi Hills, Meghalaya State, India). Both of these specimens were collected in the broad vicinity of juxtaposition between India and Bhutan, the type locality as vaguely provided in the original description. We choose the latter specimen (AMNH 171170), the more mature of the two, as the neotype of Arctonyx collaris, and accordingly restrict the type locality of collaris to Nongpoh (25\u00b054\u2032N, 91\u00b053\u2032E), Khasi Hills (Meghalaya State, India) . This specimen was collected on 13 May 1949 by W. N.

Diagnosis: The species of Arctonyx are medium-to large-bodied badgers that superficially resemble species of the closely related genus Meles (Allen, 1929 (Allen, , 1938 . Externally, Arctonyx can be distinguished from Meles by its naked, distinctively hoglike snout; its pale (rather than black) throat; its pale (rather than dark) front claws; and by the morphology of the subcaudal anal sac, which is situated dorsad to the anus (as opposed to Meles, in which the subcaudal anal sac incorporates the anus; Pocock, 1941: 420) . The skulls of Arctonyx and Meles are very different (Fig. 8 ). Relative to Meles, Arctonyx skulls have (among many other differences) markedly flattened auditory bullae; a more elongate, dorso-ventrally compressed, and much narrowed rostrum; proportionally smaller and more widely spaced cheekteeth; a more strongly curved upper incisor arcade; a notched (as opposed to simply U-or V-shaped) posterior postdental palate (formed by the pterygoid bones) that extends further behind the dental arcade, essentially reaching the auditory bullae; and a reduced angular process of the mandible, which is raised above the level of the mandibular toothrow. On the basis of the close genetic relationship between Arctonyx and Meles, Marmi, L\u00f3pez-Gir\u00e1ldez & Dominga-Roura (2004) recently suggested that the two could be regarded as congeneric, but the trenchant external and cranial traits that distinguish these two classically recognized genera argue for their continued distinction at the generic level (see also Bininda-Emonds, Gittleman & Purvis, 1999) , especially now that both genera are no longer regarded as monotypic (see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 373, "end": 385, "text": "(Allen, 1929", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 386, "end": 400, "text": "(Allen, , 1938", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 740, "end": 758, "text": "Pocock, 1941: 420)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1807, "text": "Bininda-Emonds, Gittleman & Purvis, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 813, "end": 820, "text": "(Fig. 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "RESULTS"}, {"text": "Arctonyx is restricted to East and Southeast Asia, incorporating most of China, the eastern Indian Subcontinent and Indochina, as far south as the Isthmus of Kra; an outlying population occurs on the Sunda Shelf in the mountains of Sumatra (see below).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Distribution: The modern and fossil distribution of"}, {"text": "Arctonyx are sister taxa, now generally regarded as the only two component genera of the mustelid subfamily Melinae (Marmi et al., 2004 (Marmi et al., , 2006 Sato et al., 2004; see below) .

Later, Pocock (1940 elected to recognize the nominal Indian form taxoides as a subspecies distinct from Chinese races on the basis of its perceived smaller skull size. However, Pocock had very few mature specimens available for his comparisons (and indeed very few mature specimens of Indian A. albogularis remain available in museum collections today). We note that the skull of an adult Indian specimen of A. albogularis at RMNH (marked 'Hindustan', condylobasal length 142 mm) demonstrates that the range of size variation in Indian specimens (condylobasal length c. 110-142 mm) is broadly similar to that observed across all Chinese populations we have studied (116-149 mm) . In addition to recognizing three subspecies of smaller, northern hog-badgers (i.e. A. c. collaris of the Himalayan region, A. c. albogularis of southern China and A. c. leucolaemus of northern China), drew from Allen's (1938) tables of cranial measurements for Chinese hog-badgers to suggest that an additional, somewhat larger subspecies might be recognized from Fujian Province in south-eastern China. Allen's (1938) argument for recognition of a small northern Chinese subspecies of A. albogularis appears compelling on morphological grounds. Six adult specimens that we have examined from Beijing and Hebei (including older adults) are all very small, as is L\u00f6nnberg's (1923) holotype of milne-edwardsii from Gansu (condylobasal length < 124 mm in all seven specimens).

There are only a handful of specimens of A. collaris in museums marked with elevations below 600 m; the lowest elevation given on a specimen label is '100 m' (BMNH 15.12.1.8, Sai Yoke, Thailand). Duckworth (1997) noted that 'all recent records [of Arctonyx in Laos] came from above 500 m, but as all were in the same catchment, it is unclear if this represents a pattern of altitude, geography, or even just chance . . . All records were from forest, and elsewhere it occurs mainly in forest' (see also Duckworth, 1998; Duckworth et al., 1999) . Long & Minh (2006) discussed recent records of A. collaris in central Vietnam (the Central Annamites area), where it was encountered in 'primary lower montane forest' at 900 m at one site, and in 'disturbed, primary hill forest' at 640 m at another. Based on our canvas of published accounts and specimen label data, we suggest that the seemingly patchy occurrence of A. collaris in Southeast Asia (Duckworth et al., 1999; Long & Minh, 2006) reflects its typical absence from lower-elevation habitats and preferred occurrence in little-disturbed hill and lower montane forests above about 500-600 m. Undisturbed upland forested tracts possibly offer the best combination of sites for burrowing, diversity of food and escape from predation for A. collaris. The core elevational range of this species appears to lie between about 600 and 1400 m, with all records spanning 100-1500 m, but little information is available with respect to its upper elevational limit of occurrence. In their account of the mammals of Thailand, Lekagul & McNeely (1977) quoted the upper limit of occurrence as 3500 m for 'A. collaris', but we suspect this elevational information is based on highelevation localities quoted for the genus in China or Sumatra, where species other than A. collaris are found.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 484, "end": 500, "text": "Duckworth (1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 791, "end": 807, "text": "Duckworth, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 808, "end": 831, "text": "Duckworth et al., 1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 834, "end": 852, "text": "Long & Minh (2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1256, "text": "(Duckworth et al., 1999;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1275, "text": "Long & Minh, 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1880, "text": "Lekagul & McNeely (1977)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ARCTONYX COLLARIS F.

One notion that has been presented by previous reviewers is that Indochinese Arctonyx are smaller at more northern latitudes than in the south Lekagul & McNeely, 1977) , although Osgood (1932) observed that 'specimens from southern Laos are fully as large as northern ones.' Our larger sample of specimens from the region offers little evidence for a latitudinal size gradient. In any case, many fewer full-grown skulls are available from northern Myanmar and Thailand (e.g. BMNH, MCZ, USNM) than from more southerly localities, and many skulls are too imprecisely localized (e.g. skulls labelled 'Siam', 'Vietnam', or unlabelled from Indochina at MNHN and BMNH) to be useful in assessing geographical variation. We agree with Osgood (1932) that there is no clear basis for the subspecific discrimination of the nominal taxon annaeus, named by on the basis of an immature specimen, from 'A. c. dictator' (which we do not distinguish subspecifically from typical A. collaris). Pocock's (1940) description of consul as a somewhat smaller race linking 'A. c. dictator' (i.e. A. collaris) and 'A. c. taxoides' (i.e. A. albogularis) was prematurely conceived, in part because the majority of his specimens were immature (and see Pocock, 1941: 499) .

All of these are characteristic features of A. collaris. Pei (1940) discussed an additional record of 'Arctonyx cf. rostratus' from the Pleistocene of Jiangsu Province, further to the east. In the holotype of rostratus, condylobasal length measures 148 mm -i.e. closer to samples of modern A. albogularis (range 110-149 mm) than A. collaris (150-172 mm), although falling close to both (in the type the zygomatic arches are broken and missing, such that the skull cannot be plotted in our Fig. 2) . Based on its qualitative features, we suspect that rostratus is best characterized as a synonym (or perhaps chronological subspecies) of A. collaris. If this is the case, Sichuan and Jiangsu specimens referred to rostratus indicate that the geographical range of A. collaris extended further north in the middle Pleistocene than today. However, we suggest that it is inadvisable to synonymize this fossil taxon formally before its morphometric and qualitative features are more conclusively compared against both A. collaris and A. albogularis. More recently, Long, de Vos & Ciochon (1994) referred Middle-Late Pleistocene material of A. collaris from six different cave sites in Indochina and Thailand to 'A. cf. rostratus'. aptly illustrated the extreme variation in cheektooth size, shape and occlusal morphology within a local population of A. collaris from Mt Toungoo in Myanmar (e.g. Fig. 12 ). Similarly striking is the range of dental size variation seen locally on the Bolovens Plateau of Laos and in peninsular Thailand (e.g. Figs 12, 13 ). Based on our museum studies of carnivores worldwide, we suspect that A. collaris shows more intrapopulational variation in molar size than any other carnivore species (Pocock, 1940) , although molar variability is also striking in local series of Arctonyx hoevenii. This is an excellent avenue for further, detailed comparative ecomorphological study. We suggest that extraordinary cheektooth variability in Arctonyx may be tied to the greater comparative importance of vermivory in its diet relative to other badgers (see below). Committed vermivory in mammals is commonly correlated with evolutionary reduction or loss of molars and/or unusual molar size and shape variability (e.g. Griffiths, 1978; Rickart, Heaney & Utzurrum, 1991; Balete et al., 2007) , assumedly reflecting the reduced importance of stringent genetic control in molar development in mammalian vermivores. Vermivory (and myrmecophagy) are also usually accompanied by a comparative elongation of the rostrum relative to related taxa (Anderson & Jones, 1967; Griffiths, 1978; Musser, 1982) , as seen in Arctonyx relative to other badgers -assumedly an adaptation for digging through the soil with the snout.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 145, "text": "Hooijer, 1947)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 471, "end": 481, "text": "Pei (1940)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1502, "text": "Long, de Vos & Ciochon (1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2145, "text": "(Pocock, 1940)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2649, "end": 2665, "text": "Griffiths, 1978;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2699, "text": "Rickart, Heaney & Utzurrum, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2720, "text": "Balete et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2968, "end": 2992, "text": "(Anderson & Jones, 1967;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2993, "end": 3009, "text": "Griffiths, 1978;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3010, "end": 3023, "text": "Musser, 1982)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 903, "end": 910, "text": "Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1810, "text": "Fig. 12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1949, "end": 1960, "text": "Figs 12, 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "ARCTONYX COLLARIS F.

Their diggings were first seen at Bivouac No. 5 (7900 ft [= 2408 m]) where we found the skeleton of an aged animal. Some hair and cartilage were still adhering to the bones. Along a brook flowing through a deep ravine the badgers had dug many funnel-shaped depressions two or three inches deep. A heavy steel trap set there (baited with the carcass of a little jungle squirrel, Tomeutes) caught one; but the powerful animal pulled free, leaving only a bunch of hair. At Bivouac No. 7 (9300 ft [= 2835 m]) a badger burrow was found in the bank of a stream that flowed through a large 'blang' or alpine meadow. This burrow was about 10 inches in diameter; a large heap of debris had accumulated in front of it.

Although more intensive study is desired to clarify the proportion of earthworms, other invertebrates and other elements in the diet of A. hoevenii, we suggest that Arctonyx hoevenii can join the distinctive Southeast Asian hemigaline civets (Chrotogale, Hemigalus, Diplogale), the Malagasy endemic Eupleres, the hyaenid aardwolf (Proteles cristatus), and perhaps the Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus) and Bat-Eared Fox (Otocyon megalotis) on the short list of carnivorans for which invertebrate prey constitute the dominant part of the diet (Davis, 1962; Von Ketelhodt, 1966; Albignac, 1974; Payne & Francis, 1985; Richardson, 1987a, b; Dang, Anh & Huynh, 1992; Joshi, Garshelis & Smith, 1997 ; plus data from museum specimens).

Robinson & Kloss (1918) likewise reported that 'at Sungei Kumbang and as high as Sungei Kring it was very common and traces of its burrowings were to be seen almost everywhere in dampish spots . . .' The relatively long museum series taken between 800 and 1400 m on Gunung Merapi (ZRC, BMNH) is another potential indication of local abundance in appropriate habitat. Holden (2006) noted that there are no specimens of A. hoevenii at the Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense (MZB, now based in Cibinong), a fact that we have confirmed. Reference to specimens from 'the Garo (= Karo) Highlands' at MZB (then as 'the Buitenzorg Museum') by Robinson & Kloss (1918: 12-13) may be based on a mistaken impression that Schneider's (1905) Karo Highlands specimen was deposited there. In fact, Schneider (1905) mentioned that his specimen, the first of A. hoevenii to be deposited in a museum collection, is in the Zoological Museum (today the Mus\u00e9e Zoologique) at Strasbourg. Schneider noted that the local name for A. hoevenii in northern Sumatra was Garum, that it lived in burrows in the mountains and that its flesh was considered a local delicacy, perhaps because of its thick layer of subcutaneous fat.

More recently, various studies have shown Melinae, as traditionally constituted, to be a polyphyletic assemblage, with its component members sharing various traits that are either primitive amongst musteloid carnivores, or convergently derived (e.g. Radinsky, 1973; Dragoo & Honeycutt, 1997; Marmi et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2004) . Mydaus is now classified with skunks in a separate carnivoran family, Mephitidae (Dragoo & Honeycutt, 1997) . Melogale is now thought to be most closely related to a clade containing otters and musteline (weasel-like) mustelids, rather than other badgers, and is classified by some in the monogeneric subfamily Helictinae (Sato et al., 2004) .

Records of occurrence document that its distribution extends across the entire length of Sumatra's Barisan range (Fig. 11) . It is known to be common in some areas, is present in three national parks (Gunung Leuser, Kerinci Seblat and Barisan Selatan), and ranges even into the highest and most inhospitable reaches of Sumatra's mountains. It does face some threats. It is apparently an appealing food item (Schneider, 1905) and is probably traditionally hunted for local consumption in some areas, although this has no doubt long been the case, and as a result seems likely to be sustainable. Undoubtedly much more important is the threat from logging and forest clearance, which has been widespread and severe in Sumatra in recent years (Brooks et al., 1999; Jepson et al., 2001; Linkie, Smith & Leader-Williams, 2004; Miyamoto, 2006) . However, unlike other hog-badgers, A. hoevenii rarely descends below 800 m elevation, and logging and forest clearance in Sumatra remain largely, though not entirely, concentrated in lowland and hill forests up to c. 1000 m (Kinnaird & O'Brien, 1998; Kinnaird et al., 2003; Linkie et al., 2004; Gaveau, Wandono & Setiabudi, 2007) .
