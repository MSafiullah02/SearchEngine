According to the Saudi Ministry of Health, 1579 MERS-CoV cases had been reported across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia up until April 25, 2017, with 660 deaths related to MERS-CoV (Saudi Ministry of Health, 2017). The mortality rate has been high (Das et al., 2015, Al-Dorzi et al., 2016, Al-Hameed et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2016a, Sherbini et al., 2017), particularly in patients with symptoms (Sherbini et al., 2017).",

The study outcome modeled was the time interval from symptom onset to a confirmed diagnosis. The author investigated multivariate count models using Poisson regression and negative binomial models. Initially, over-dispersion was assessed and the adequacy of negative binomial and Poisson regression models was checked. The log likelihood and the deviance goodness-of-fit were calculated for each model and compared. It was found that the negative binomial model outperformed the Poisson regression model. The negative binomial model was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios (RR and aRR) and to identify predictors of the time interval to confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset. The RR was used to assess the strength of the association between the predictor and the time interval of confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset. If the RR was >1 it was considered that the predictor increased the time interval to confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset; if the RR was <1 it was considered that the predictor reduced the time interval to confirmed diagnosis after symptom onset.

The study recommended that individuals in close contact with camels should be targeted in future MERS-CoV education campaigns. These individuals need to be aware that they are at increased risk of MERS-CoV. This could help to screen for MERS-CoV early and limit the spread of the virus. Furthermore, detailed investigations should be performed in patients with an unknown source of infection; any exposure needs to be considered and documented as a possible source of infection. The decreased risk of a delay in seeking diagnosis in patients with household-acquired infections could be due to the case definition of MERS-CoV as per the Saudi Ministry of Health. The case definition of MERS-CoV includes whether there has been close contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection. Al-Mohrej et al. reported that 74% of their sample knew that the MERS-CoV infection is transmitted via close contact (Al-Mohrej et al., 2016).",
