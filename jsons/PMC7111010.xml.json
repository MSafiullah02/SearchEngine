Three pBR194c-based plasmids containing overlapping cDNAs that cover the full-length S glycoprotein coding sequence were purchased from the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BC, Canada). The following primers were used for amplification and overlapping PCR cloning of the full-length S glycoprotein: #1, 5\u2032 AGTCGGATCCGGTAGGCTTATCATTAGAG 3\u2032; #2, 5\u2032 CCATCAGGGGAGAAAGG CAC 3\u2032; #3, 5\u2032 GTGCCTTTCTCCCCTGATGG 3\u2032; #4, 5\u2032 GAAGAGCAGCGCCAGCACC 3\u2032; #5, 5\u2032 GGTGCTGGCGCTGCTCTTC 3\u2032; and #6, 5\u2032 ACTGTCTAGAGTTCGTTTATGTGTA ATG 3\u2032. The amplified full-length S gene was cut with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in pCDNA3 plasmid to create pCDNA3-S. This plasmid was used to generate various soluble fragments of the S glycoprotein. The pair of primers #7, 5\u2032 AGTCGGATCCGACCGGTGCACCACTTTTG 3\u2032 and #8, 5\u2032 AGTCGGGCCCCTGTTCAGCAGCAATACC 3\u2032 was used to amplify the S1 fragment containing residues 17\u2013756. The fragment was cut with BamHI and ApaI and cloned into corresponding sites of expression vector pSecTag2B (Invitrogen). Primer #7 and primer #9 5\u2032 CTAGCTCGAGCAACAGCATCTGTG 3\u2032 were used to amplify fragment S276 containing residues 17\u2013276. The fragment was cut with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites in the pSecTag2B vector. Fragment S537 was generated by cutting S1 with BamHI and HincII and cloned into pSecTag2B cut with BamHI and EcoRV. To generate soluble S glycoprotein ectodomain, Se, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to create an ApaI site upstream to the transmembrane domain of the S glycoprotein gene in pCDNA3-S. Then this plasmid was digested with PstI and ApaI and the resulting fragment was used to replace the PstI\u2013ApaI fragments from pSecTag2B-S1, creating the pSecTag2B-Se plasmid. PstI\u2013ApaI fragment from pCDNA3-S was used to replace the PstI\u2013ApaI fragment from pSecTag2B-Se to create pSecTag2B-S without tags. To create the fragment containing residues 272\u2013537, the following pair of primers, primer #10 5\u2032 GATCGGATCCGGTACAATCACAG 3\u2032 and primer #11 5\u2032 GATCGGGCCCGACACACTGGTTC 3\u2032, was used for PCR amplification. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and ApaI and ligated to pSecTag2B digested with the same restriction enzymes. All S fragments and full-length S constructed in pSecTag2B had their native leader sequence (aa 1\u201316) replaced with a mouse k chain leader sequence.",

The bands were broad when observed at low exposure (Fig. 4 and data not shown). These data indicate significant glycosylation as observed for S glycoproteins from other coronaviruses. Based on approximate estimations of molecular weight it appears that S2 is not as heavily glycosylated as S756. Notably, S276 is heavily glycosylated if one assumes that only glycosylation contributes to the increased molecular mass. Most of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was not cleaved, although we observed weak bands due to smaller proteins, one of which runs at the same position as S756, suggesting the possibility for inefficient cleavage (Fig. 4). We cannot rule out the possibility of random digestion by proteases. Further studies are needed to determine if the S glycoprotein cleavage is necessary for its function.",

Expression of the full-length S glycoprotein with both vectors, pCDNA3-S and pSectag2B-S, supported fusion with ACE2 expressing cells efficiently, as evidenced by formation of syncytia of various sizes and a \u03b2-gal reporter gene-based assay (Fig. 5\n). Interestingly, the pSectag2B-S construct in which the S glycoprotein leader peptide was replaced by a mouse k chain leader sequence induced faster formation of syncytia that were larger and more numerous than those induced by pCDNA3-S, which encodes the native S glycoprotein (data not shown). The extent of fusion mediated by S expressed by using pSectag2B-S was also higher than by using pCDNA3-S as measured by a reporter gene-based assay (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that the S glycoprotein may not be efficiently transported to the cell surface but further studies are required to confirm this possibility. They also suggest that the \u03b2-gal assay described here can serve as a quick and quantitative method to identify inhibitors of the SAR-CoV entry into cells, as well as a tool to study SARS-CoV entry mechanism.",

To explore the possibility that this was due to low sensitivity of these two assays, we also used another assay based on fluorescent dye redistribution that is able to detect fusion of single cells. We were not able to detect statistically significant differences between cells transfected with plasmids encoding the full-length S glycoprotein and various negative controls including plasmids encoding soluble S fragments at different pH (data not shown), suggesting that the higher levels of receptor expression achieved by expression of recombinant ACE2 could be important for cell\u2013cell fusion. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated and could play a role in the entry of cell-free virus into cells. It is also possible that higher levels of S expression could lead to measurable cell fusion, even when the receptor concentrations are relatively low. Overall, these results suggest that recombinant S glycoprotein alone can mediate cell fusion, that fusion can occur at neutral pH, and that its efficiency is dependent on the concentration of the receptor molecules.",

Incubation of Vero E6 cells that are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection and several cell lines that are not with soluble fragments resulted in binding only to Vero E6 cells by all fragments except the smallest one (S276) (Figs. 6A and B\nand data not shown).

This antibody did not inhibit binding of the S537 fragment to Vero E6 cells although it did bind this fragment (Fig. 6B and data not shown), suggesting that the RBD is localized between residues 303 and 537. Because of the relatively large antibody size and the possibility for steric hindrance, one can assume that the RBD is even further downstream of residue 303. By contrast, the RBD for murine hepatitis virus was mapped to the N-terminal 330 amino acids (14). However, recently, the RBD of the HCoV-229E was localized to a fragment containing amino acid residues 407\u2013547 (4,5). It remains to be seen whether there is structural similarity of these fragments with the RBD-containing fragments of the SARS-CoV S1 glycoprotein (e.g., S272\u2013537), and whether such similarity is related to the use of the same host for replication, although these two viruses use different receptors.
