            "text": "CoV-2 infects people by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a 62 transmembrane endopeptidase that cleaves both angiotensin 1 and 2, and which is expressed by 63 epithelial cells in several organs including the airways. Co-factors facilitating Sars-CoV-2 infectivity 64 are the transmembrane peptidase serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which cleaves the Sars-CoV-2 spike protein, 65 and possibly the protease furin 3 . Understanding the expression ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the 66 airways of people with asthma may help determine whether asthma itself or treatment with inhaled 67 or oral corticosteroids may alter susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially related 68 disease severity. We have therefore explored the RNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in 69 human bronchial brushes and biopsies from previously described cohorts of people with asthma of 70 varying corticosteroid treatment intensity (as an index of severity) and healthy controls. 71 Airway brushes and biopsies were collected at bronchoscopy with written informed consent and 72 ethical approvals. Airway brushes were placed into RNAprotect and airway biopsies from the 2 nd -5 th 73 generation airways were placed into RNAlater. Bronchial brush ACE2 expression data were available 74 from 356 patients (88 healthy volunteers and 268 asthmatics [mild to moderate asthma 125; severe 75 asthma: 143]), across five asthma/healthy volunteer cohorts, Leicester UK (n=34) 4 , the multicenter 76 Bronchoscopic Exploratory Research Study of Biomarkers in Corticosteroid-refractory Asthma 77 (BOBCAT) study (n=54) 5 , the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort (n=154) 6 and healthy volunteers and 77 asthmatics from the Leicester and BOBCAT cohorts. For bronchial brush 80 data, the five data sets were combined into a single data set after first adjusting for batch effects by 81 separately mean centring each of the five data sets. The same method was applied to the biopsy 82 data. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Kruskal-Wallis test where used to test for between group 83 differences in ACE2 expression. The Spearman rank correlation was used when reporting 84 correlations. All analyses were performed using R statistics, version 3.characteristics of the participants (median [Q1:3]) for healthy volunteers vs people with 87 asthma were respectively as follows: age -25(22-34) vs 40(27-49) years, FEV 1 % predicted -101(93-88 109) vs 71.5(58-88) %, and FEV 1 /FVC -82(78-85) vs 72(62-79).
