Accumulating evidence indicates that G6PD deficiency affects cells other than those of erythrocytes. For example, G6PD deficiency is now known to affect oocyte development and/or survival as well as growth and senescence of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). Moreover, human G6PD-deficient neutrophils exhibit impaired production of nitric oxide, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide, which may explain the impaired bactericidal effect of these cells [2] . Taken together, these findings indicate that G6PD deficiency causes abnormal cellular redox, thus affecting cells other than red cells. Oxidative stress is known to affect viral proliferation and virulence [3] ; however, the effect of G6PD deficiency on viral infectivity has not been thoroughly studied.",

Because the actual nucleocapsid gene expression did not differ significantly between HFF1 and HFF3 at 2 h after infection, gene expression at 2 h after infection was normalized to 1. In HFF1, viral gene expression at 4, 6, 8, and 10 h after infection was 2-, 29-, 468-, and 1801-fold higher than at 2 h after infection, respectively.

All of these data confirmed that G6PD-deficient cells had less reducing power than control cells. Moreover, DCF staining revealed significantly higher ROS production and significantly lower GSH levels in virus-infected G6PD-knockdown epithelial cells than in control cells (GSH, 49.5 vs. 66.3 mol/g of protein).
