Science strives to be the objective search for truth through empirical proof to verify hypotheses as the foundation for theories, scientific laws, and ultimately paradigms. It simply is unrealistic, however, to presume that those with power will excuse science from political and commercial pressures that drive the rest of society. Organizations understandably view the scientists they employ or fund as resources for their policies and whistleblowers as individuals who substitute their own personal agendas or policy preferences for those of the employer whom they are supposed to serve. But whistle-blowers view themselves as first serving the scientific method and the integrity of their research. This clash of loyalties is inevitable and timeless, and so is retaliation.",

Despite those classic patterns of suppression, currently whistle-blowing is increasingly common both within public and private sector contexts, with increasing impact. What once was the rare aberration is taking root (Calland and Dehn 2004; Miceli et al. 2008 ). This chapter primarily surveys scientific whistle-blowers who have overcome those barriers to make a difference and how they did it. It analyzes the strategies and tactics they have used successfully to challenge the status quo. Finally, it illustrates how the rule of law can help make a difference by combining loyalty to the scientific method with legal campaigns to make a difference. It emphasizes scientific whistle-blowers from the United States, which has pioneered these free speech rights generally and specifically for scientists in the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012.",

These whistle-blowers were chosen, because through their experiences they sparked enactment of pioneering legal rights in the United States for scientists who \"commit the truth.\" Dr. Aubrey Blumsohn. Dr. Blumsohn was a researcher at Sheffield University in England, which contracted with the multinational US firm Procter and Gamble (P&G) to study therapy responses of its osteoporosis drug Actonel. The object was to prove that Actonel was more effective than its competitors on the market. To pursue the research, Dr. Blumsohn conducted \"blind\" tests, not knowing whether subjects received Actonel or a placebo. To learn the results, he had to study the company's \"randomization codes\" to sort who had received what. But P&G refused to provide them on grounds that they were proprietary information and told him to accept its own summary (GAP 2006) . Although he refused, P&G began ghostwriting and publishing under Blumsohn's name research findings about Actonel that he had not made. When he was finally permitted to do a limited review, he discovered that up to 40 % of data essential for conclusions on different graphs was missing. Under public pressure, on June 2006, P&G released the missing data to Dr. Blumsohn. The results were unfavorable for Actonel, and he was able to publicly correct the record (Blumsohn 2006) .",

In 1993 Dr. Chandler was a clinical researcher at Cook County (Illinois) Hospital's Hektoen Institute, specializing in addiction treatment, when the hospital received a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to test a new model for treatment of pregnant heroin addicts. The experiment, named \"New Start,\" was to replace neighborhood clinics that dispensed methadone. Instead, it would provide a \"Cadillac\" treatment -holistic therapy that included day care, training, and other assistance beyond mere distribution of an alternative drug. Among Dr. Chandler's duties as project director for the grant was running the accompanying day care center. Unfortunately, she learned that systematic fraud compromised the program. So much money was diverted that the children did not have electricity and hot water, and single cribs had to accommodate multiple infants. She further protested that the institute was sending false progress reports on the study. Instead of careful controls, women were recruited off the streets with enticements of shopping discount certificates. Data was reported for \"ghost subjects.\" The actual humans did not provide informed consent before participating, and inadequate records supported claimed results. The clinic diluted methadone by up to 80 %, which left the pregnant addicts still working the streets as prostitutes to support their heroin addictions. In short, the deluxe program was far less effective than the traditional clinics and actually made matters worse for many who participated (Chandler 1996 vehicles had been paid for, inspected, and sent to warehouses, where they had been gathering dust for 19 months without delivery. Mr. Gayl's mission was to free up delivery of the MRAP vehicles. When his Pentagon briefing of General Petraeus was canceled, Gayl began blowing the whistle to Congress and then through congressional referral to the media. After an ensuing public spotlight which included congressional hearings, the MRAP vehicles were delivered (Cantu 2011; Merit Systems Protection Board 2011) . The results were dramatic. Land mine casualties before delivery had been 60 %, including 80 % of fatalities. Afterward the casualty rate dropped to 5 %. Subsequent Pentagon research on roadside explosions in Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrated that the MRAP vehicles were 14 times more effective than their predecessor (Vanden Brook 2012; Lamb 2014) . Gayl paid a horrible price in retaliation for his disclosures. He was silenced, suspended, ordered to take psychiatric examinations, stripped of his duties, temporarily stripped of his security clearance, placed under repeated criminal investigations, reassigned to his home as a duty station, and fired (Cantu 2011; Soeken 2014) . After a 7-year legal battle, the marines settled his case on terms that included a commendation which recognized his whistleblowing and appointment to a new team established to prepare whistle-blowing policy and training for the marines.",

Dr. Graham is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientist whose testimony has prevented recurrence of tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths from improperly approved drugs such as the painkiller Vioxx. In November 18, 2004, Senate Finance Committee testimony, he defied agency threats and exposed that Vioxx was one of a half dozen government-approved drugs that killed the patients who took them for treatment. Vioxx, a potent \"Cox-2\" painkiller, had caused between 30 and 55,000 fatal heart attacks. His testimony attacked inaccurate research claims for the drug's safety that the FDA improperly had accepted as safety verification (Graham 2004) . The manufacturer Merck faced some 27,000 lawsuits for claims that eventually settled at $4.85 billion in damages and pulled the drug from US markets (Wadman 2007) . Although defensive FDA officials intensified efforts to silence Dr. Graham, he persisted against a broad array of highly profitable but dangerous Cox-2 drugs with similar qualities to Vioxx. The agency placed unprecedented safety restrictions on all Cox-2 pain relievers, finding that the drugs were dangerous. Treating Vioxx like cigarettes, it banned product advertisements and required large warning labels (Government Accountability Project 2005).",

They not only exposed the lack of basis for studies with \"too perfect\" results, but they examined the causes -flawed peer reviews and fear of liability by professional journals (Stewart 1989) . Their controversial disclosures sparked a series of high-profile congressional hearings, in part based on their investigative work. They obtained a temporary reassignment to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Chairman John Dingell was leading oversight of scientific research fraud (Knightworth 2014) . Ironically, a different kind of whistle-blowing caused their downfall within the NIH -exposures of intellectual property theft that critics charged had publicly discredited scientific research. In 1993 the NIH closed their laboratory and placed the relevant files into deep storage after a \"plagiarism machine\" they had created produced too many controversial charges (Grossman 1993) . Feder later became staff scientist for the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a nongovernmental watchdog, where he regularly blows the whistle as part of his job.",

Until his 2013 retirement, Dr. James Hansen was the top climate change scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He also has been the pioneer scientist warning about potentially apocalyptic effects from global warming. On June 23, 1988, he testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the causal relationship between human emissions and higher temperatures, warning that \"the greenhouse effect is here.\" The New York Times responded, \"Global Warming Has Begun\" (Nation Institute 2013). His alarms principally targeted the use of fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide, predicting that \"[b]urning all fossil fuels could result in the planet being not only ice-free but human-free\" (Merchant 2013) . Hansen warned that without a social overhaul to reduce carbon emissions, earth will reach a tipping point beyond which it is too late to stop glaciers from melting, with temperatures over the next century increasing 4-5 F. The last time earth was that hot, some 3 million years ago, sea levels were 80 f. higher than today. Florida was largely underwater, and coastlines were up to 50 miles inland, which would exile most of today's concentrated populations. Katrina disasters would become the rule rather than the exception, with cities forced to continually rebuild above a transient water line (NASA 2006) . His research helped spark international conferences and treaties (United Nations 1992), as well as in-depth, ongoing UN studies substantially confirming his concerns (Climate Science Watch 2014).",

He charged that pharmaceutical industry studies purportedly proving their effectiveness could not withstand scrutiny, although the FDA consistently accepted them.

Dr. Morris spoke out in every available forum from the FDA to the Phil Donahue national television program. He warned that the vaccine would be a net public health hazard.

He charged that the $29 billion anti-ballistic missile defense was based on false scientific claims unsupported by credible research. He further documented that the Department of Defense was paying contractors multiple times for the same studies containing different covers and summaries but identical research, with overcharges up to $3 billion (Saucier 1992; Page 1993) . His most significant disclosures, however, challenged the planned trillion-dollar next generation of Star Wars, known as Brilliant Pebbles. The vision for that strategy was to shoot shotgun-like blasts of \"pebbles,\" or small interceptors, from satellites to knock out enemy missiles from above. As Mr. Saucier's research demonstrated, however, the pebbles would burn up in the earth's atmosphere far above the highest point of any missile invented. The army proposed Mr. Saucier's termination for unacceptable performance (Evans 1992) . But the US Office of Special Counsel found a \"substantial likelihood\" that he was correct and ordered an investigation of his charges (Cushman 1992) . Although the Pentagon did not concede error, his disclosures received broad support from the media, independent scientists, and NGOs. Congress conducted its own investigations, and in 1993 the Brilliant Pebbles program was canceled (Giraffe Heroes Project 2014; Marshall and Claremont Institutes 2014).",

In 1988 Dr. Wigand accepted a position as vice president for Research and Development at Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, one of the nation's four largest. His objective was to follow through on corporate commitments to create safer and more fire-resistant cigarettes. He began to blow the whistle internally, however, when associated research projects were inadequately supported or canceled altogether, as was the entire research program eventually. He became convinced that, contrary to its official position, the company was trying to kill advances in cigarette safety, in part because saving lives could undermine defenses against lawsuits that existing products were unsafe. In 1993 the company fired him. Dr. Wigand, however, worked closely with the media, Food and Drug Administration Chief Donald Kessler, Congress, and prosecutors for his disclosures to make a difference. They did, after being highlighted by the Wall Street Journal and eventually the CBS 60 Minutes program. His disclosures led to a massive wave of government litigation against the tobacco industry. Despite threats of civil and criminal prosecution, his testimony for state attorneys general was a turning point in litigation that resulted in a $206 billion settlement, one of history's largest. Eventually Hollywood turned his story into an Oscar-nominated movie, The Insider. He went on to start a new career as a high school science and Japanese teacher, winning an award as Fannie Mae First Class Teacher of the Year. He became a leader of the global NGO, Tobacco-Free Kids (Wigand 2011; Devine and Maassarani 2011).",

International Brotherhood of Teamsters first established a \"public policy exception\" to the at-will doctrine, permitting corporate workers to file lawsuits in tort for damages.

Corroboration by a government agency changes the dynamic from an isolated critic charging government misconduct to an official body finding that the agency has or may have engaged in the same alleged misconduct. This means there is far less risk for congressional oversight offices, the media, or outside organizations who are considering a spotlight on or support for the whistle-blower's charges. From this perspective, the US Office of Special Counsel, as an official government watchdog agency, has been particularly significant. Mr. Saucier and Dr. Settepani both had credibility breakthroughs by channeling their disclosures through the OSC's whistle-blowing channel. An OSC \"substantial likelihood\" finding has had the effect of a bureaucratic Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for whistle-blowers. It also institutionalizes an investigative process, which can be a magnet for other whistle-blowers waiting to see what happens, as well as further opportunities for scrutiny when the ensuing report is released.",

It long has been recognized within the whistle-blower community that support from an effective congressional \"angel\" can be far more powerful than legal rights. This applies both to making a difference and to surviving professionally. That is particularly the case if the aroused member sits on a committee with relevant budget, legislative, and/or oversight authority. Franz Gayl, for example, did not file a WPA whistle-blowing disclosure. But his briefings for the Chairs of the Senate Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence Committees, among others, placed a spotlight on the Marine Corps for failing to timely deliver MRAP vehicles to Iraq and Afghanistan (GAP 2013; POGO 2008) . The congressional spotlight led to prominent media coverage. After the Corps' leaders were unable to defend the delay in Senate hearings, the lifesaving vehicles were finally freed up and sent to the troops (Soeken 2014; Vanden Brook 2014). Aldric Saucier never convinced the Department of Defense to admit error on Star Wars or Brilliant Pebbles, but he made a difference by helping convince the House Appropriations Committee to cut off funding. Stern warnings from House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers helped Saucier professionally to survive long enough to make a difference (Foerstal 2010: 43-45; Rothstein 1992) . Dr. David Graham sparked an immediate national media scandal by releasing his scientific dissent in 2004 Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. When the FDA tried to remove his duties through reassignment, it reconsidered and withdrew the proposal after sharp protests and warnings from 22 members of Congress, including Senator Charles Grassley (California Healthline 2004) . Ned Feder and Walter Stewart took this tactic the next step, after the House Commerce Committee possessing relevant oversight authority brought them onto its staff for temporary assignments with a mandate to continue investigative work from an independent perch (Culliton 1990) .",

Nongovernmental organizations are the institutional \"lifers\" often working on and engaging in ongoing oversight of the same issues raised by scientific whistle-blowers. As a result, NGOs can be invaluable from numerous perspectives. They may well have different agendas or even a conflict of interest to some degree with the whistle-blower's objectives. Further, unless communications are covered by the attorney-client privilege, the NGO will be vulnerable to legal bullying to disclosure confidential communications. So the partnership is not risk-free. Whistle-blowers only should take those risks consistent with relationships of earned trust. But if it is earned and the terms are carefully structured, NGOs can be invaluable partners. In early stages, the whistle-blower can channel anonymous disclosures through an organization. The organizations may well know the relevant media outlets working on the issue. They can identify the politicians who have made a difference, compared to those who just have made noise. They can identify other trusted experts for professional corroboration, as well as sympathetic legal counsel. When NGOs are recognized for independent professional expertise, their organizational support can be another credibility seal of approval for media, legislative, or regulatory agencies that respect their conclusions. To the extent that NGOs have a significant number of members, they can provide an immediate base for political support and grassroots communications with key decision-makers. In short, sympathetic NGOs can provide another key base for whistle-blowers to engage in effective legal campaigns.",

As the case studies in this chapter demonstrate, conventional rules can be used effectively for accountability to successfully challenge abuses of power, not just to shield the status quo.
