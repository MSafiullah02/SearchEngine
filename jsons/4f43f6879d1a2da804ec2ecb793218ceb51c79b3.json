The synthesis of peptide aldehydes has recently been reviewed [18] . The oxazolidine linker satisfies the following criteria for a general linker for the immobilisation of aldehyde functionality: (i) it is low cost and easy to construct, (ii) it is chemically stable (long shelf life), (iii) it does not require preformation (i.e. the aldehyde couples directly to the solid phase), (iv) aldehyde attachment is generic and (v) it cleaves under mild conditions that leave no residue upon evaporation, allowing biological screening without further purification. The linker has been used to synthesise several peptide aldehydes including fellutamide B [19] and a library of reversible SARS coronavirus main protease inhibitors [20] . The method was developed and applied on the Multipin system, a technique developed for solid-phase library synthesis. The Multipin method of peptide synthesis is an effective, low cost, simultaneous multiple synthesis technology, which gives researchers ready access to large numbers of peptides. The key to the method is that peptide synthesis and biological screening are totally integrated; no single peptide is given individual attention except at the coupling stages of the process. Synthesis has traditionally been performed on plastic pinsarranged in an 8 \u00c2 12 microtitre plate format, thus permitting the simultaneous preparation of sets of 96 peptides (or multiples thereof) [21] . The fundamental advantage of this technology, which is an alternative to beaded cross-linked resins, is the ease of handling large numbers in multiple parallel synthesis. Syntheses were performed on a hydrophilic graft polymer (polyamide), which is suited to aqueous chemistries and as described by Rademann et al. [20] , is far superior to hydrophobic polymer matrices such as polystyrene resins and surfaces.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 77, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 146, "end": 150, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 171, "end": 175, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 199, "end": 202, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 222, "end": 226, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 255, "end": 259, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 308, "end": 312, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 361, "end": 365, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 430, "end": 434, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1020, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1095, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1786, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2108, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "As shown in Scheme 1, the protected amino acid aldehyde is attached to the solid phase by condensation with a threonine residue 1 to form a support-bound oxazolidine system 2. The oxazolidine is stable to non-aqueous acid and to base, and as the secondary amine is difficult to acylate, it can tolerate subsequent peptide synthesis. Others have protected the secondary amine with a Boc group to eliminate possible acylation of this amine during peptide chain extension [20] . Although this would be important for longer syntheses, and the synthesis of peptidomimetics requiring the use of more activated electrophiles, we found this extra protection step unnecessary for this short library synthesis. We do, however, recommend this advance made by Rademann [20] for future syntheses. Being stable to non-aqueous acid, TFA may be used to remove acid-labile protecting groups prior to release of the aldehyde function (i.e. cleavage). Importantly, the linker allows for side-chain deprotection and subsequent removal of residual compounds such as TFA, organic solvents and scavengers before mild cleavage of the peptide aldehyde 4 using aqueous TFA (0.1%), containing acetonitrile as a cosolvent. The two-step cleavage conditions allow for a shorter (30 min) TFA treatment because there is no concentration of product with no evidence of Pbf protecting group remaining on cleaved peptides.

Arginine is particularly well suited to this design criterion because it is the preferred substrate P1 cleavage amino acid for a number of proteases. To prepare for library synthesis, we synthesised the peptide aldehyde leupeptin as a control sequence. Leupeptin is a naturally occurring microbial peptide aldehyde derived from the culture filtrates of different streptomyces. Importantly, all C-terminal arginine peptide aldehydes partially exist in the hydrated form as demonstrated by the [M + H + H 2 O] + peak in all MS run ( Table 2 ). Lewis and Wolfenden [22] demonstrated this originally in their work on the active site of papain, whereas Gancsik et al. [23] extended this work using 13 C NMR spectroscopy. The hydrated form also exists in N-terminal aldehydes as demonstrated by Rademann, Meldal and Bock [24] and Groth and Meldal [25] .
