The 5-11% increase in virus detection rate in our study can probably be explained by good clinical samples (i.e., nasopharyngeal aspirates) and comprehensive virus diagnostics (i.e., sensitive in-house PCR for the most important viruses and multiplex PCR for other respiratory viruses) (10, 16, 19) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 309, "end": 312, "text": "(9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 313, "end": 316, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 317, "end": 320, "text": "21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 500, "end": 504, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 793, "end": 797, "text": "(10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 798, "end": 801, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 802, "end": 805, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 308, "text": "(Table S1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The rhinovirus detection rate of 76% was clearly higher than in previous studies focusing on the first wheezing episode (7, 9) . Previously, this level of rhinovirus detection rate has only been found in recurrently ill infants with a high risk for asthma (23) . Values are presented as number of cases (%), mean (standard deviation), or median (interquartile range). * Data available: total immunoglobulin E, n = 102; blood eosinophil count, n = 107; heart rate, n = 109; O 2 -saturation, n = 104; respiratory frequency, n = 110; blood leukocyte level, n = 108; C-reactive protein, n = 101; temperature, n = 105. \u2020Severity scores were assessed on a scale from 0 (none) to 12 (severe) (18) . The high prevalence of rhinovirus is most likely explained by a more sensitive real-time PCR than that of the conventional PCR (11) . As rhinovirus infection is closely linked to wheezing status, atopy, and increasing of age (3, 7) , the dominance of rhinovirus in our findings may also be explained by our solely wheezing cohort, high prevalence of atopic characteristics (56%), and the relatively high mean age (12 months) of the study patients. Our in-house rhinovirus PCR is known to detect also rhinovirus C genotypes. The sequencing of the amplicons is currently under investigation. Our study shows that already the first rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode was closely associated with atopic characteristics, especially with typical first manifestations of atopic march, eczema, and blood eosinophil count. These findings are in agreement with previous studies (2, 7, 9, 24) ; however, the association of the first rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode with prolonged cough has not been reported earlier (1, 3) . This finding supports the hypothesis that children susceptible to rhinovirus-induced wheezing may already have a chronic, partly atopy-related inflammation in the lower respiratory tract manifesting as cough, and this condition is exacerbated by rhinovirus infection (4) . Importantly, already the first rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode has been associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing as a long-term sequel and this risk may be even greater if the patient has atopic characteristics or a family history of asthma (2, 7) . In the cohort of slightly older children with recurrent wheezing, many studies have linked rhinovirus-induced wheezing to atopic characteristics, that is, specific IgE sensitization, increased eosinophil count, atopic eczema, and maternal atopic asthma (1, 3, 13, 25, 26) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 123, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 124, "end": 126, "text": "9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 256, "end": 260, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 685, "end": 689, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 819, "end": 823, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 917, "end": 920, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 921, "end": 923, "text": "7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1564, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1567, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1570, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1574, "text": "24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1705, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1706, "end": 1708, "text": "3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1981, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2247, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2250, "text": "7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2506, "end": 2509, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2510, "end": 2512, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2516, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2517, "end": 2520, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2521, "end": 2524, "text": "26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Earlier research has shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy is an independent risk factor for rhinovirusinduced wheezing (27) .

This emphasizes its role as a single causative agent of wheezing. Importantly, we found coinfections with up to four different viruses, which highlights the need of quantitative PCR with standardized sampling procedures and serology. These methods in turn would give more accurate information on which virus is actively replicating at the very moment, and which viral infections are incipient or waning as reviewed in Jartti et al. (10) . Virus-virus cross talk may also modulate the immune responses of viruses in coinfections, as we have recently shown between HBoV and rhinovirus (17) . The association between coinfections and longer duration of wheezing may, however, indicate a more severe illness, due to either simultaneous, or more often, consecutive viral infections (23, 24) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 141, "text": "(7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 142, "end": 144, "text": "9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 239, "end": 243, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 412, "end": 416, "text": "(15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 417, "end": 420, "text": "16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 503, "end": 507, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1268, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1462, "text": "(23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1466, "text": "24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a respiratory virus can be detected in all children experiencing a first-time wheezing episode. Rhinovirus is an important etiologic agent already at the first wheezing episode and it closely associates with age, atopic characteristics, and parental smoking. In the age-group of this study, rhinovirus was more closely linked to wheezing than RSV. While RSV was associated with hospitalization, rhinovirus was linked to prolonged cough suggesting a more chronic type of illness in children susceptible to rhinovirus-induced wheezing. HBoV was the third most prevalent lower airway pathogen. It was not linked to atopic characteristics, and prolonged HBoV shedding was rare in this cohort. Our results call attention to the differences in clinical characteristics between these three major viral causes of wheezing in clinical practice and research (4). RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; HBoV, acute human bocavirus 1; coinfections, \u22651 virus detected. Data expressed as odds ratio (95% confidence interval). Bold and italic face indicates a significant result, p < 0.05. In regression analysis, factor positive values were compared to factor negative values. Multivariable analyses were adjusted to age (rhinovirus, HBoV and virus coinfection), or to age and sex (RSV).
