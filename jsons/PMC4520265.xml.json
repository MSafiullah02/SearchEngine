The movement of bacteria across the skin barrier can lead to surgical site infections (SSI), one of the most frequent infectious complications of surgical procedures, with the potential risk for adverse outcomes [1]. SSI involves different inflammatory responses that range from low to high clinical significance [2], with that following abdominal surgery being a typical example associated with increased morbidity and mortality [2\u20135]. Worse still, SSI can spread to surrounding areas and vital deep structures, often requiring debridement or drainage [3, 4]. Consequently, the treatment of SSI leads to increased costs, especially when we consider the high number of surgical procedures and their complexity in a typical referral hospital [2\u20135].",

The microbiology results for isolates from SSI are shown in Table 2, with a preponderance of Escherichia coli (n = 55, 20.4 %) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52, 19.3 %), while gram-positive cocci and Candida spp. were also frequent at rates of 29.7 % (n = 80) and 17.1 % (n = 46) respectively. Antibiotic resistance to two or more antibiotics occurred in 64.9 % (n = 174), with rates of Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (n = 30) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa carbapenem-resistant (n = 32) of 11.1 % and 11.9 % respectively, but with low rates of typical multi-resistant microorganisms such as Acinetobacter baumanii (2.9 %, n = 8) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (2.2 %, n = 6). The microorganisms isolated from intra-abdominal abscesses were the same of those isolated in SSI samples in the 20.9 % of the patients (n = 34) with similar rates of of multi-resistant bacteria. No relationship was established between the intra-abdominal abscesses and the occurrence of SSI based of clinical and surgical evaluation. Based on the culture antibiograms, 99.5 % of patients received appropriate antibiotic treatment. The most commonly used antibiotics are shown in Table 2, with the use of multiple, simultaneous or sequential antibiotics being used in 72.5 % of the cases (n = 195). A mean of 2.6 antibiotics was used per SSI, with treatment lasting 14 \u00b1 8 days.",

Host risk factors for SSI include morbid obesity, disease severity, advanced age, low blood-protein levels and malnutrition, diabetes, malignancy and sepsis, while other risk factors that include susceptibility include immunosuppression, smoking and having a distant infection site [10]. Pre-existing morbidity, the time of surgery and the type of SSI may also play key roles in the development of SSIs [10]. Thus, an increasingly elderly population with a greater number of comorbidities significantly increases the risk of developing an SSI [9, 12]. Critically ill patients represent an increasing proportion of the inpatient population that will undoubtedly lead to greater diagnostic and management challenges, especially given that most SSIs in the ICUs are nosocomial [9]. SSIs are most common in high-risk patients, with an incidence of about 11.7 % [12, 13].",

This could be explained by the higher antibiotic pressure, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, illness severity and prolonged treatment periods. Indeed, concomitant treatment for peritonitis compounded matters. We also showed higher reliance on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) because enteral nutrition was poorly tolerated and we opted to initiate it early to avoid hypoalbuminemia, which is a risk factor for fungal infection and SSI in critically ill patients [19].
