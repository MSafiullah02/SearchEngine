            "text": "Twenty-six years ago, the danger/injury model in immunology was formulated and published, holding that the immune system does not care about \u201cself\u201d and \u201cnon-self,\u201d but that it is any form of cell stress/tissue injury, rather than the presence of a non-self (i.e., genetically foreign entitied) that induces immunity [1, 2]. The core of the danger/injury model refers to the generation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), a term coined by Land [3], also denoted as \u201cdanger signals\u201d in the international literature. Current notions hold that all organisms on our planet use DAMPs for their defense against any cell stress and tissue injury [4]. Indeed, the evolutionarily determined function of DAMPs is to promote injury-induced defense responses, the aim always being to repair damaged tissue\u2014that is, to restore homeostasis. Unique germline-encoded endogenous molecules accomplish this goal by promoting context-dependent proinflammatory responses, which transition into inflammation-resolving pathways that are driven by suppressing/inhibiting DAMPs (SAMPs), a term coined by Land [5, 6] for molecules counteracting DAMPs. Moreover, in the presence of altered-self or non-self antigens, the DAMPs shape adaptive immune responses that have the same homeostasis-restoring aim.",

For example, excessive or prolonged production of DAMPs and/or impaired generation of SAMPs may promote hyperinflammation or chronic inflammation. Consequently, these molecules are now considered valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in human disorders [5, 7\u201311]. Moreover, the pathogenetic involvement of these molecules qualifies them as relevant drug targets or therapeutics as well. Indeed, accumulating preclinical data have encouraged envisaging DAMPs as therapeutic targets for inhibition [5, 12\u201317] and administration of SAMPs as candidate drugs [5, 18\u201327] for treating acute or chronic inflammatory disorders. On the other hand, DAMPs may also be therapeutically administered when enhancement of adaptive immune responses, such as antitumor immune responses [28\u201332], are desired.",

Another strategy is to switch the homeostatic set points to different values of DAMPs and SAMPs that are better suited for dealing with a given extreme hyperacute or chronic abnormal condition.",

As comprehensively reviewed [5], all possible tools of the innate immune system, involving PRR-triggered, proinflammatory cellular, humoral, and molecular pathways, can get activated by DAMPs, in the case of an infectious injury together with microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), also called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Secretion by DAMP-activated cells of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, associated with leukocyte recruitment/infiltration are among the most prominent features of this inflammatory scenario. An integral part of these DAMP-promoted responses is the process of phagocytosis, which can be regarded as a critical mechanism of innate immunity, and is usually accompanied by humoral innate effector responses, including activation of the complement system.",

Here, SAMP-orchestrated inflammation-resolving responses are exemplified by the action of SPMs as the best-studied molecules so far. In fact, the distinct functions of SPMs are multifactorial. These functions include the ability to terminate infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes into injured tissue and to mediate stop signals to limit further leukocyte recruitment. Further, SPMs have been shown to enhance macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic leukocytes (efferocytosis) and cellular debris. In turn, macrophages, during the process of efferocytosis, were observed to produce SPMs [33, 34]. Moreover, SPMs have been demonstrated to decrease excessive oxidative stress [35], to augment bacteria killing by phagocytes, to act at both the transcriptional and translational level, and to shorten time to resolution, via activation of endogenous resolution programs (see [36]). For example, resolvin E1 (RvE1) and RvE2 were found to stimulate the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 and phagocytosis potently. Moreover, lipoxin A4 (LXA4), RvD1, and RvE1, as well as the maresin (MaR) intermediate eMaR, were observed to stimulate transdifferentiation of M1-like to M2-like macrophages committed to execute tissue repair and regeneration [37\u201342].",

Such therapeutic maneuvers are worth considering in, for example, hyperinflammation (e.g., SIRS, as currently observed in Covid-19) and certain chronic inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. Current pharmacological strategies include the use of mAbs, peptides, decoy receptors, and small molecules, but also absorption/adsorption procedures [60].

In principle, potential therapeutics include adenosine, AnxA1, and SPMs, but also SPM derivatives, other synthetic small molecule agonists of SPM receptors, inhibitors of SPM-degrading enzymes (e.g., soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors), and modifiers of the SPM synthesis pathways. With the indications mentioned, SPMs have already been proven to have potent proresolving actions in a range of disease models. Given their potency, many drug development opportunities are possible. As outlined by Serhan [64], aspirin and statins have a positive impact on these resolution pathways, producing epimeric forms of specific SPMs, whereas other drugs can disrupt timely resolution. As further outlined by this investigator [64], evidence from recent human and preclinical animal studies indicates that SPMs are physiological mediators and pharmacological agonists that stimulate resolution of inflammation and infection. This observation is reason enough to use them clinically as inhibitors and antagonists alone, and to develop immunoresolvents as agonists to test resolution pharmacology and their role in catabasis for their therapeutic potential [64]. Dalli [65] argues similarly regarding the potential of resolution pharmacology-based approaches in developing new therapeutics for combating infections that do not interfere with the immune response. This issue is also raised by Schett and Neurath [66], who discuss potential intervention strategies for fostering the resolution process and the implications for the therapy of inflammatory diseases.",

Fired by the danger/injury model in immunology [1, 2, 73\u201376], a conceptual revolution in oncology has emerged in that cancer is considered to be entities that can be detected and destroyed by the immune system under certain circumstances. The core of this new concept refers to the phenomenon of ICD. Of note, however, only a few lethal stimuli are intrinsically endowed with the ability to instigate ICD, including certain chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy, certain oncolytic viruses, and photodynamic therapy [77]. They are called \u201cICD inducers\u201d [78]. There is accumulating evidence indicating that these therapeutic inducers cause ICD through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated with or induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [79]. Typically, ICD is associated with the emission of a series of DAMPs that are generated in a precise spatiotemporally defined configuration. This coordinated emission of DAMPs then allows elicitation of a robust antitumor immune response that is associated with the establishment of immunological memory.",

Forthcoming clinical studies would also greatly benefit from a development of antibody-based assays to quantify HMGB1 redox isoforms, presently assessed by mass spectrometry methods\u2026.

On the DAMP side, key molecules such as HMGB1, circulating free DNA, S100 proteins, and extracellular histones appear to be the first choice; on the SAMP side, the most studied SPMs are obviously the best candidates. Sophisticated clinical trials focused on specific diseases will have to be designed and conducted to gain sufficient knowledge regarding the key DAMPs and SAMPs involved in any given disease, allowing subsequent calculation of a ratio useful for therapeutic considerations.",

Taking 4 ng/mL as the homeostatic \u201c1,\u201d the DAMP increased by 100 in SIRS. On the other hand, as shown in other sets of studies on surviving sepsis patients, the plasma level of the SAMP LXA4 decreased to ~ 149 ng/mL, compared to homeostatic LXA4 levels in controls of ~ 277 ng/mL (see [82]). Taking 277 ng/mL as the homeostatic \u201c1,\u201d this SAMP decreased by 0.53. According to such a tentatively constructed example, the DAMP:SAMP ratio for SIRS would be 100:0.53, that is, > 1, increased by factor of + 188. As a therapeutic consequence, such data would be in favor of blocking this DAMP or substituting this SAMP, or even both. Certainly, such a calculation should be optimized by application of mathematical formulae, allowing the construction of a valid software-based algorithm for the exact timing and dosing of the selected agent.",

When these responses are dysregulated, for example, when DAMPs are emitted in excess or permanently, they may promote progressive reactive fibrosis, leading to late heart failure (for reviews, see [85\u201388, 93]). Consequently, DAMPs may be regarded as therapeutic targets to prevent MI-induced late heart failure [94].",

On the other hand, inhibition of DAMP emission that is too late may lead to progressive profibrotic responses that may result in a reactive fibrosis associated with heart failure. Together, these therapeutically induced adverse effects might be avoided by meticulous monitoring of the DAMP:SAMP ratio, which would allow application of DAMP inhibitors at the right time and in the right dose.",
