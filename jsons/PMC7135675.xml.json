            "text": "Immunoglobulins (Igs), together with lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and lysozyme form the very important antimicrobial system of bovine lacteal secretions. Igs are antibodies that are synthesized by mammals in response to antigenic or immunogenic stimuli such as bacteria and viruses, and thus provide protection against microbial infections. Bovine colostrum, which is a rich source of Igs, also confers passive immunity to the newborn during development of its own immune system (for a review see Lilius & Marnila, 2001). Igs with specific antibody activities can be increased in lacteal secretions through targeted hyperimmunization protocols, using vaccines containing inactivated pathogenic microbial material against which the Ig activities are desired. This increased pool of antibodies can be enriched further through concentration/fractionation techniques, leading to production of Ig products containing high antibody concentrations and titres. Such preparations may find beneficial applications in human and animal healthcare and well-being by preventing infections and controlling diseases (for reviews see Kelly, 2003; Korhonen, Marnila, & Gill, 2000; Lilius & Marnila, 2001). This review focuses on the current large-scale technologies employed to produce such specific Ig products, and the clinical studies undertaken to determine their efficacies against human and animal infections.",

IgM antibodies, which are produced in smaller amounts than IgG, are considerably more efficient than IgG in most of the above-mentioned activities, especially in complement fixation, but it remains obscure how significant this mechanism is in milk or colostrum. In contrast, the secretory IgA does not fix complement or opsonize bacteria, but agglutinates antigens, neutralizes viruses and bacterial toxins, and prevents the adhesion of enteropathogenic bacteria to mucosal epithelial cells (Marnila & Korhonen, 2002).",

            "text": "Although the published scientific literature contains a substantial amount of information on methods and technologies used for isolation, extraction, concentration, and purification of Igs from milk/colostrum, not all the reported methods are suitable for large-scale production of Igs. Only those techniques that have the potential for scale up are described in this review. With the rapid development of new chromatographic and membrane-separation technologies in the last 20 years, it is now possible to isolate individual milk proteins at large-scale (Kelly & McDonagh, 2000; Korhonen, 2004; Maubois, 1998). A number of pilot- or industrial-scale methods for isolation and purification of Igs from colostral or cheese whey, based on membrane-separation (Kothe, Dichtelmullar, Stephan, & Echentopf, 1987; Stott & Lucas, 1989) or membrane-separation and chromatographic techniques (Bottomley, 1993; Korhonen, Syv\u00e4oja, Vasara, Kosunen, & Marnila, 1998) have been patented. The recovery rate of Igs using these methods varied from 25% to 70% of the level present in the starting material. Thomas, Cordle, Criswell, Westfall, and Barefoot (1992) developed a process for selective enrichment of Igs from whey by filtration through formed-in-place membranes on sintered stainless-steel tubes. The process employed both size exclusion and protein charge manipulation around the isoelectric point of proteins to selectively reject or pass components of the stream. IgG from cheese whey was enriched from 8% to 20% of total whey protein with 90% recovery of the IgG. More recently, Baruah and Belfort (2004) used the Predictive Aggregation Transport Model and microfiltration (0.1 \u03bcm pore size membrane) of transgenic goat milk with a helical hollow-fibre module operated at low uniform transmembrane pressure, low permeate flux rate, and permeate co-current flow to increase the yield of Ig in the permeate from less than 1% to over 95%. Similarly, microfiltration (0.1 \u03bcm membrane porosity) combined with ultrafiltration (UF; membrane cut-off 100 kDa) of bovine, equine and caprine colostrum resulted in at least 80% recovery of IgG in the microfiltrate, and IgG/TS purity of more than 90% with subsequent ultrafiltration (Piot, Fauquant, Madec, & Maubois, 2004). Mehra and Kelly (2004) also produced an Ig-rich fraction through microfiltration of cheese whey using tubular ceramic membranes (0.1 \u03bcm pore size). The Ig to protein ratio of this fraction was approximately 2.5\u20133.0 times that of the original cheese whey.",

            "text": "Membrane-separation of milk/colostral whey Igs does not result in high purity or recovery of Ig fraction. Specific chromatographic techniques have been applied to further improve the yield and purity of the Ig preparations, but some of them may not be easily scaled-up. IgG was isolated from whey by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC). UF concentrated whey was applied to IMAC column loaded with copper, and IgG fractions with purities of 52% for cheese whey (Fukumoto, Li-Chan, Kwan, & Nakai, 1994) and 77.2% and 53% for acid and cheddar cheese whey, respectively (Al-Mashikhi, Li-Chan, & Nakai, 1988) were isolated. An immunoaffinity chromatography method suitable for isolating pure IgG subclasses IgG1 and IgG2 from cheddar cheese whey or colostrum was reported by Akita and Li-Chan (1998). Immunoaffinity columns were made with specific egg yolk IgY raised against bovine IgG1 and IgG2. Milk that was free of either IgG subclass was successfully produced by the selective removal of IgG1 or IgG2 subclasses by this technique. Expanded Bed Adsorption Chromatography (EBAC) was applied to isolate Igs from whey (Nielsen, Olander, & Lihme, 2002) using adsorbent with tailored ligand chemistry. EBAC provides significant advantages over conventional packed bed column chromatography. The decisive characteristic of the adsorbent media to expand in the column when upward flow of liquid is applied allows free passage of particulate impurities in the feed stream through the column thus allowing crude, non-clarified feeds to be applied to the column. Ig purity of between 50% and 70% was achieved by this method. The first industrial implementation of EBAC in the dairy industry has been carried out for the separation of whey proteins by Dairy Farmers in Australia.",

It is probable that this loss of antibody activity during whey preparation was due to the involvement of Igs in casein precipitate. The extent of the decrease was lower during whey production from skimmed colostrum than from whole colostrum. Additionally, rennet whey retained more antibody activity during manufacture than acid whey. The IgG antibody activity was resistant to heat treatment at 72 \u00b0C for 15 s, and less stable at 80 \u00b0C for 15 s in whole and skimmed colostrum, and skimmed colostral whey. On the other hand, the IgM activity in all colostrum-derived fractions was reduced by both heat treatments without any significant differences between the fractions. However, the SIgA antigen-specific antibody activity was more susceptible to whey preparation processes and heat treatments than IgG and IgM activities. The heat stability was markedly lower in whole colostrum than in other colostrum-derived fractions.",

Established milk heat treatments, batch pasteurization (63 \u00b0C for 30 min) did not destroy the specific antigen-binding activities of IgG, while high-temperature short-time (HTST, 72 \u00b0C for 15 s) led to 25\u201340% loss of IgG concentration and a similar reduction in antigen-binding activities. On the other hand, ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment (138 \u00b0C, 4 s) denatured all of the concentration and antigen-binding activities of IgG. In contrast, Mainer, S\u00e1nchez, Ena, and Calvo (1997) reported that bovine milk Igs could resist the HTST pasteurization treatment without affecting their structure. Only 1% of the IgG, 2% of the IgA, and 14% of the IgM concentrations were denatured when milk samples were heated in glass capillaries and a temperature-controlled water bath. Denaturation of IgG was determined using RID. In a similar further study, Mainer, Dominguez, Randrup, Sanchez, and Calvo (1999) also showed that the HTST pasteurization had little effect on the activity of bovine colostral IgG as the original rotavirus neutralizing activity was reduced by only 0.5%.",

Colostrum is collected, defatted, pasteurized under conditions that retain biological activity and dried. The products are in the form of spray dried and freeze-dried powders, and filtered colostrum whey liquids or concentrates. Dried products include whole colostrum powder, skim powders, skim colostrum protein concentrate and colostrum whey concentrates. It is not possible to list here every conceivable Ig ingredient/product that is commercially available in the global market. Some of the potential health promoting Ig ingredients are under properietary development or clinical investigations. Table 3\nlists some of the commercial Ig products that are described in the literature (Pakkanen & Aalto, 1997; Scammell, 2001). Gastrogard-R\u2122 is a hyperimmune anti-rotavirus colostrum concentrate that was launched in Australia as a pharmaceutical product for prevention of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants and young children (Davidson, Daniels, Nunan, Moore, & Whyte, 1989; Davidson, Tam, & Kirubakaran, 1994). Intact\u2122 is a colostrum concentrate from non-hyperimmunized cows that has been shown to be effective in running and rowing performance (Buckley, Abbott, Martin, Brinkworth, & Whyte, 1998; Buckley et al., 1999). Biotest Pharm GmbH (Germany) produces Lactimmunoglobulin Biotest, a colostrum product from non-immunized cows for human use. It has been tested for treatment of severe diarrhoea in AIDS patients (Stephan, Dichtelmuller, & Lissner, 1990). Viable Bioproducts Ltd. of Finland produces Bioenervi\u2122, a sterile-filtered colostrum product that provides growth factors and antimicrobial factors during strenuous physical activity performed by athletes (Mero, 1995). Ig preparations are further formulated into retail products such as powders in tins, sachets, capsules, chewable tablets and liquid clostrum whey. Consumer food products containing Ig supplements have also been formulated. Galagen Inc. manufactures a bovine colostrum-derived ingredient, Proventra, that contains a natural mixture of bioactive proteins including broad-spectrum Ig's, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, growth factors and cytokines (www.savvynet.com/galagen). It has been demonstrated in clinical studies that Proventra weakens harmful microbial organisms, prevents the growth and attachment of these organisms to the gastrointestinal (GI) walls, and promotes general health. A number of Proventra-containing foods are on the market. Basic Plus\u2122 is a milk-based refrigerated dietary supplement containing active Kefir cultures and Proventra\u2122 Natural Immune Components. Vistrum contains a mixture of beneficial probiotic cultures, Proventra\u2122 Natural Immune Components and soluble fiber. PharmAssure\u2122 Proventra\u2122 is a dietary supplement that delivers Galagen's Proventra\u2122 Natural Immune Components in tablet form. Other food products containing Proventra from Novartis Consumer Health and Wyeth-Ayerst are under development. The world's first liquid-drinkable colostrum product (ImmuNOVA) was launched in Finland by Novatreat, a Finnish company (www.novatreat.com/englanti/immunova). ImmuNOVA is a dietary supplement that contains antibodies and growth factors of bovine colostrum in a biologically active state. It is intended mainly for hospital use as a nutritional preparation, but can also be used to boost immune system or treat momentary bowel or intestine problems. New consumer products have been fortified with hyperimmune milk ingredients, containing specific antibodies that promote health and well-being, from Stolle Milk Biologics Inc. (SMBI) (www.smbimilk.com/products). These products include Stolle-Q\u2122, a powdered health drink being sold in Korea by Pulmuone; Stolle Dent\u2122, a new toothpaste sold by Lanfar International in Taiwan; Stolle Nutritional Tablets\u2122 fortified with Stolle milk ingredients are distributed in Japan by Kanematsu Wellness Corporation, and NuVimR, a refrigerated patented dietary supplement beverage marketed in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Lemaco (Egypt) has launched Extra Fit baby food with bovine colostrum and vegetables suitable for babies 6 months and over (Archibald, 2005). New Ig products continue to be introduced into the commercial market specifically for the healthcare sector. (Table 4\n)",

The antibody titre against certain pathogen or its virulence factor can be raised up to several hundred times by immunizing the cow with microbial vaccines before parturition. Such an immune colostrum resulting from immunization regimes has fundamentally different properties and efficacies against pathogens than normal colostrum and these two concepts should, therefore, be differentiated from each other. This is emphasized by the fact that at present normal colostrum and preparations made from it are in many countries regarded as a food or dietary supplement, whereas the colostral preparations from immunized cows are often regarded as pharmaceuticals or their regulatory status remains to be defined.",

The adherence of the principal caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans is a crucial factor in the colonization of the oral cavity. In recent studies bovine colostral Igs have been shown specifically to block bacterial colonization factors when cows are immunized with proper bacterial structures. Mitoma et al. (2002) prepared a fusion of a saliva-binding alanine-rich region of a cell surface protein antigen (Pac) and a glucan-binding domain of the glucosyltransferase-I cell surface protein from Str. mutans and immunized cows with the fusion. The immune milk preparation made from colostrum of these cows proved effective in the prevention of dental caries development in an experimental rat model when given as concentrate once a day for 55 days. Shimazaki et al. (2001) examined the effect of immune milk containing antibodies against the above mentioned fusion protein, on adult subjects after an antibiotic (cetylpyridinium chloride) treatment. The immune milk inhibited significantly recolonization of Str. mutans in the saliva and plaque as compared to the control group. Also, the ratios of Str. mutans to total streptococci in saliva and plaque of the immune milk group were lower than in the control group.",

This has enabled the development of commercial Ig preparations targeted at health promotion in farm animals and humans. In order to improve the efficacy of such preparations customized immunization schemes of cows has been designed with the purpose of raising specific antibodies. The enhancement of specific antibody activities of milk Igs through targeted immunization and isolation/concentration technologies may in future have remarkable potential in producing Ig products for human health care, not only as part of a health-promoting diet, but also as an alternative or supplement to the medical cure of specified human diseases. In clinical trials, the Ig preparations have seldom caused any undesired symptoms and the health risks are mainly due to allergenic properties of whey proteins (Bernhisel-Broadbent, Yolken, & Sampson, 1991; Gingerich & McPhillips, 2005). However, the regulatory status of these products is still unclear in many countries or they are treated as pharmaceuticals (for a case study, see Hoerr & Bostwick, 2002).",

Thus, an orally administered bovine milk or colostral Igs have proven effective in the prevention of orally mediated infections. On the other hand, in the treatment of already established infections promising therapeutic effects have been reported only in such diseases where the infection is maintained through a constant reattachment and reinfection, e.g. inside the oral cavity or the GI lumen, and where toxins or inflammatory compounds are involved, which can be neutralized by the specific Igs of colostral preparations.",

The prevention of diarrhoea should not only diminish mortality but also improve health, in general. Increasing antibiotic resistance among pathogens gives emphasis to the need to develop new means to prevent diseases by nutritional intervention. Modulation of the GI flora has turned out to be an integral part of health promotion also in developed countries. It is suggested that combining bovine milk or colostral Igs with probiotic lactic acid bacteria could provide considerable prospects for health promotion in the future. Other bioactive components occurring naturally in colostrum, such as lactoferrin and growth factors may also have synergistic effects when addressing gastrointestinal disorders.",
