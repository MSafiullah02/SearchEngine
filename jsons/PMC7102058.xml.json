            "text": "There are many possible explanations as to why patients with SCID had a mental development that was slower than their age-matched peers. First, there have been many studies stating that chemotherapy/HSCT causes neurodevelopmental deficits in young children [9\u201311]. These studies were based mostly on patients who received chemotherapy for leukemia. Leukemia patients receive much more intensive therapy to their craniospinal axis (intrathecal chemotherapy and possibly cranial irradiation), whereas SCID patients do not receive the same intensity of chemotherapy. We do not know the impact of chemotherapy on the neurodevelopmental function of patients with SCID since all of our patients received a myeloablative transplant. Second, most patients with SCID are diagnosed early in life after a severe infection. Many have been hospitalized for an extensive period of time. Even after they leave the hospital, they remain immunosuppressed and are therefore socially isolated from other children for a prolonged period. Many patients have no other siblings and are not able to see and interact with any children. These factors lead to a lack of exposure to developmental stimuli. These factors seem a likely cause as to why there are significant decreases in development for the first 3 years post-HSCT. It is encouraging to see that those patients, whose immunosuppression has decreased over time, are able to lead more normal lifestyles. There were four patients who were tested 5 years post-HSCT. These patients have returned to school and have minimal immunosuppression. These four patients have overall development scores that are comparable to their test scores prior to HSCT.",

A possible explanation for this is that while in the hospital, patients receive physical therapy regularly. While home, intensive physical therapy may not occur regularly. Since these patients remain immunosuppressed, they are not able to join playgroups and gym classes as other normal toddlers do. Therefore, the psychomotor development scores may decline until they have the ability to increase social interactions.",

Unlike many of the children who were diagnosed and transplanted later in life, these children were hospitalized at birth and remained in protective isolation until they were discharged home. Being in the hospital at such an early age and not being able to interact with outside stimulation is the most likely cause of decreased adaptive function in our younger children.

The major limitation of this study as well as other studies of neurocognitive outcomes post-pediatric HSCT is the small sample size. SCID is a very rare disease, so the numbers of patients in this study is small, which is unavoidable. In addition, the presenting symptoms of patients and their outcomes vary considerably. The strength of this study is that all patients had the same diagnosis, SCID. None of these patients had received prior chemotherapy, unlike patients have who received HSCT for a malignant disease. The second strength of this study is that all patients received a Busulfan-containing conditioning regimen. There was not a mixture of both TBI and non-TBI-based conditioning regimens as is seen in most studies of this nature. We do not know the outcomes of patients who did not receive a chemotherapy conditioning regimen prior to HSCT. However, due to the social isolation and prolonged immunosuppression that occurs with any transplant for SCID, it is possible that the neurocognitive function of all recipients of HSCT for SCID will have some developmental delays until they are able to increase their social interactions. Long-term studies should focus on comparing those who did and did not receive a chemotherapy conditioning regimen to determine the impact on chemotherapy as well as social isolation.",
