The patient was well until 7 days prior to ICU admission, when he developed severe non-bloody diarrhea, approximately 20 times daily. Three days prior, he presented to an emergency department (ED) and was sent home after rehydration with normal saline with a reportedly normal chest x-ray (CXR). Two days prior, he presented to his primary care provider with continued diarrhea and fever to 39.4 \u00b0C, and he was sent home with anti-diarrheal medications. One day prior, he returned to the ED with chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough productive of dark sputum, and he was found to have a new left-sided infiltrate on CXR, consistent with a pneumonia. He also reported dark urine and anorexia. He denied nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, or dysuria. In the ED, he was noted to be febrile with a temperature of 40.6 \u00b0C, tachycardic with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 115/65 mmHg, and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 93% on 4 L per minute of oxygen supplementation. He was transitioned to bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) due to his increased work of breathing and hypoxia and received empiric antibiotic therapy and steroids, including intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and linezolid. He was then transferred to the University of Chicago Medicine MICU. His respiratory status worsened, and after about 5 h he was intubated.

It was also positive, with 1,967,036 viral copies per mL. The patient was treated with cidofovir, and hemodialysis was initiated for what was determined to be rhabdomyolysis.
