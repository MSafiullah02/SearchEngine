The EEG in acute encephalopathy generally reveals a non-epileptiform disturbance such as slowing of background activity with or without presence of triphasic waves (TWs) and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) [1, 7, 20]. These patterns are widely believed to reflect an underlying structural or metabolic problem; however, there is limited evidence linking specific EEG abnormalities with plausible causative factors.",

An early model in the cat identified localized delta activity in cortex overlying circumscribed white matter lesions or localized thalamic lesions, unilateral diffuse delta activity ipsilateral to thalamic or hypothalamic lesions, and bilateral delta activity with bilateral lesions of the midbrain tegmentum [20]. Slowing of EEG background activity without slow-wave activity in the delta range has been linked to cortical impairments that spare subcortical structures. White matter abnormalities can lead to projected slow-wave activity or to TWs, while clinical entities involving both cortical and subcortical regions can induce both background slowing and slow-wave activity [25]. Despite these observations, a rigorous classification of EEG patterns and underlying causes of encephalopathy is lacking.",

            "text": "We identified hospitalized patients from October 2007 to February 2012 who underwent EEG to evaluate an acute alteration in mental status. Based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association, acute alteration in mental status was defined as altered consciousness and/or change in cognition (i.e., memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that was not better accounted for by a preexisting, established or evolving dementia. The disturbance had to have developed over a short time period (hours to days) [2]. EEGs were classified by two certified electroencephalographers into isolated continuous slowing of background activity (theta, theta/delta, or delta activity) and patterns with slowing background activity with episodic transients (TWs or FIRDA). Theta activity was defined as generalized slow background activity with a frequency of 4\u20137 Hz and amplitudes of >40 \u03bcV without intrusions of delta (<4 Hz) or alpha activity (8\u201313 Hz) for >20 % of recording during wakefulness (Fig. 1a). Theta/delta activity was defined as generalized slow background activity of 4\u20137 Hz and amplitudes of >80 \u03bcV with intrusion of alpha activity (8\u201313 Hz) for <20 % and intermixed with delta activity (<4 Hz) in 20\u201350 % of recording during drowsiness or arousal (Fig. 1b). Delta activity was defined as generalized background activity of <4 Hz and amplitudes of >80 \u03bcV with intrusion of theta or alpha activity for <20 % of recording during drowsiness or arousal (Fig. 1c). TWs were defined as repetitive electrographic elements consisting of three phases, each longer than the preceding one: a surface positive high-amplitude (>70 \u03bcV) wave preceded and followed by negative waves with smaller amplitude as first described 1950 [18] and precisely defined by Fisch [17] (Fig. 1d). FIRDA was defined as a repetitive appearance of rhythmic slow waves with a frequency <4 Hz with a frontal predilection [1, 8, 10, 11, 22] (Fig. 1e). None of the patients had TWs and FIRDA simultaneously. In patients with TWs or FIRDA, slowing of background activity was assessed as mentioned above. Patients with a normal EEG were excluded. EEG with epileptiform discharges, focal slowing, burst-suppression, flat-line EEG, patients with alpha or spindle coma, and patients without brain imaging obtained during the same hospital stay, were excluded (N = 22).\n",

Significant findings in ANOVA global test were additionally evaluated by multiple comparison tests using Bonferroni corrections. Covariates were categorized as structural (i.e., brain abnormalities, such as atrophy, white matter changes, intracerebral hemorrhages, posterior reversible encephalopathy, past and present cerebrovascular accidents) and non-structural (i.e., organ failures or insufficiencies, infections, intoxications, or drug abuse). Univariable logistic regression was used to calculate the odds of patients\u2019 clinical and imaging abnormalities having one of the five EEG patterns. For all significant results in the univariable logistic regression, a multivariable analysis was performed (adjusting for characteristics, which were significant in the overall comparisons and the use of intravenous anesthetic drugs, as evolution of cortical neuronal dysfunction by depth of anesthesia is well described [33]). Multiple logistic regression models were used for categorical outcomes and multiple linear regression models for continuous outcomes. As it was not the main aim of this study to identify independent associations of particular EEG patterns with different outcome variables, multivariable regression models were only adjusted for age. Adjustment for the use of intravenous sedative or anesthetic drugs was made for comparison of GCS on the day of EEG in the five patients groups. To assess colinearity, multiple linear regression was performed on all variables included in the multiple logistic regression analysis in order to calculate variance inflation factors. The mean variance inflation factor was 1.22, the highest value being 1.57 for age\u2014all being below 2.0. Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow goodness of fit tests were applied to check the final models. Levels for statistical significance were set at two-tailed p value of <0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with STATA\u00ae 12.0.",

All other patients were hospitalized on the neurological or medical wards. Only 13 % of patients received intravenous sedative or anesthetic drugs during or 24 h before EEG (11 had lorazepam, 6 midazolam, and 3 propofol) without significant differences between the five patients groups (p = 0.378). The most prevalent critical illness was renal insufficiency in 55 %, followed by respiratory failure (10 %), liver insufficiency (8 %), septic shock (6 %), and acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (2 %). Cerebral CT was performed in 38 and 62 % of patients who received brain MRI. Mean time between EEG and neuroimaging was 2 (\u00b115) days.

However, predominance of delta activity in patients with alcohol/drug abuse or intoxication is consistent with early work on the neurophysiology of anesthetics [33]. Interestingly, there was no significant coincidence of patients with HIV infection and use of anesthetics or alcohol abuse that would have explained the prevalence of delta activity in patients with HIV. Encephalopathy related to HIV was diagnosed in nearly half of these patients. One possible explanation might be the high burden of marked confluent white matter changes (Schmidt\u2019s score 3) seen in all our patients with documented HIV encephalopathy. Studies have described pronounced white matter changes in brain imaging of HIV-infected patients [21], possible correlates of the pathologic changes in the thalamo-cortical circuits that underlie cortical slowing. Overall there was a high prevalence of structural factors such as brain atrophy and/or white matter changes (74 %) in our cohort, suggesting diminished neurologic reserve. This contributes together with toxic, metabolic, and infectious elements to the appearance of encephalopathy. The co-occurrence of the most common structural with non-structural problems such as infections and metabolic problems was seen in up to one-third of our patients, underscoring the importance of their interplay in the genesis of encephalopathy. However, information on additional pathologic conditions, such as acute changes of blood flow or intracranial pressure could not be assessed retrospectively and would perhaps lead to an even larger proportion of patients with co-occuring acute and chronic pathologic conditions. Prospective studies are needed to determine particular EEG changes in these acute medical conditions and to answer the question if EEG might provide early information in the setting of such critical conditions.",

TWs are thought to reflect the activity of thalamo-cortical circuits which also underlie generalized epileptiform discharges and the sleep spindle activity. These structures may well be modified by subcortical white matter disease caused by neurodegenerative or ischemic processes [26, 30, 34], leading to projected slow activity or the generation of non-epileptic periodic discharges or TWs [25]. However, in our study five of six patients with TWs had isolated metabolic problems with no signs of brain atrophy or white matter changes. This suggests that structural abnormalities may promote or enable projected slower activity (delta activity or TWs), but are not essential for their appearance [25]. A clear and isolated association of renal insufficiency with the appearance of TWs could not be shown, possibly due to the small number of patients without renal problems. Aside from the significant association of liver insufficiency and multi-organ failure with TWs, there was a high odds ratio for TWs with every unit increase in ammonia or urea. Hughes et al. [23] have shown that patients with abnormal EEG patterns (defined as slow wave activity and/or epileptiform patterns in the form of bilateral spike and wave complexes) had significantly higher blood urea. Demendts et al. [12] demonstrated an accurate and sensitive EEG correlation with brain dysfunction in hepatic encephalopathy, but could not show an association with ammonia levels. Remarkably, patients with TWs had high odds of death during the same hospital stay, a result that underscores the unfavorable outcome and high mortality for this encephalopathic condition [4, 34]. Our finding of increasing odds for emergence of TWs with increasing serum levels of urea and/or ammonia further emphasizes that severity may be more important than merely the presence of organ dysfunction.",

In a prospective study, Accolla and colleagues found an independent association of structural brain lesions with the occurrence of FIRDA. They further described an association of asymmetric FIRDA with underlying focal brain lesions [1]. Early descriptions suggested a relationship between FIRDA and raised intracranial pressure [10]. Later studies, however, revealed a great variety of conditions that could be associated with FIRDA, including tumors [11, 16], subcortical lesions [24], brain edema [19], and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease [35]. As in our study, patients with FIRDA had no significant association with acute structural or non-structural abnormalities, and their outcome was mostly favorable.",

Unfavorable outcome was associated with theta/delta activity and death with the presence of TWs, while favorable outcome was mainly seen in patients with FIRDA, possibly because this pattern generally reflects an old fixed structural problem (e.g., stroke). Of note, a large proportion of patients with FIRDA had a fast (theta) background activity (73 %) and tended to have more intrusions of alpha activity (38 %) than in patients with theta background activity with (0 %) or without TWs (0 %). The trend to faster background activity in patients with FIRDA may be an additional explanation for the better outcome also reflected by their higher mean GCS. In hospitalized patients with encephalopathy, the associations of EEG abnormalities with outcomes had previously been demonstrated in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and TWs. Marchetti et al. [29] described an inverse correlation of decreasing EEG frequency in patients with cirrhosis and survival, and Bahamon-Dussan and colleagues reported poor prognosis for survival in patients with altered mental status and TWs [4]. Both studies are consistent with our findings.",

However, sedating drugs were only used in a few (13 %) patients during or 24 h prior to the EEG recording and were not used in significantly different proportions among the five EEG groups. Nevertheless, we included sedative drugs in our multivariable model. Except for the link between posterior reversible encephalopathy and delta activity, the associations identified in the univariable analyses remained significant in the multivariable models, suggesting robust associations. It is of note that the identified EEG patterns represent an intermediate state of brain dysfunction which, to a certain degree, might change significantly during the course of recovery or worsening of encephalopathy while the identified structural abnormalities in the neuroimaging represent presumably longstanding if not permanent conditions. To what degree the EEG patterns are persistent or variable over time remains unknown. The retrospective nature of this study with a consequent lack of such follow-up EEGs in most cases did not permit sufficient further analysis. Prospective studies with a repeat EEG after resolution of the acute encephalopathy would be important in this context.",

It is clear that patients may have more than one of the patterns under investigation; have mixtures of transient abnormalities (e.g., FIRDA) and background abnormalities (e.g., theta); and have co-occurrences of several structural and non-structural pathologic conditions. Analyses of such specific combinations require a larger cohort. The extent to which the specific and isolated pathologic conditions had a causal role in the development of the defined EEG disturbances cannot be determined by this study. Another limitation was that the specific anatomical distribution of brain atrophy was not characterized in the analysis of neuroimaging. Finally, the procedures for obtaining noxious stimulation to produce arousal were not standardized and were arguably suboptimal.",
