China has overtaken US as the biggest energy consumer and CO2 emitter in the world. The primary energy consumption of China was over 2800 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2013 while CO2 emissions were over 9.5 billion tonnes. The corresponding figures for the US were 2266 Mtoe for primary energy and 5.9 billion tonnes for CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, China's gross domestic product (GDP) was only 55.8% of US in 2013. The over-consumption of energy and related CO2 emissions due to low energy efficiency and carbon efficiency are big challenges for China's sustainable development, especially in the process of industrialization and urbanization (Zhu et al., 2015a).",

Here, energy intensity and carbon intensity are defined as energy consumption and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP (Lin and Li, 2014). Although China's energy intensity and carbon intensity are both declined dramatically in near decades, they are still quite large according to international comparison, even about 60% larger than those in India. Previous studies, such as Fan et al. (2007), Lin and Ouyang (2014), Zhu et al. (2015b), also particularly pointed out China's large energy and carbon intensity. It is therefore urgent for China to improve energy and CO2 emissions performance for reducing energy consumption and mitigating CO2 emissions.",

After implementing economic reform in 1978, China has gradually become an extroverted economy through international openness, but on the domestic side, market integration has been impeded. Similar to the prisoner's dilemma in game theory, beggar-thy-neighbour policies are quite common in each province because local governments have a clear incentive to keep their production of scarce raw materials to themselves or to prevent the inflow of goods produced in other provinces. It is worth noting that although there is widespread local protectionism, the magnitude of market segmentation is declining and China's regional markets are becoming more and more integrated.",

Many studies have attempted to investigate energy efficiency and CO2 emissions efficiency in China's regions and industries (see, Hu and Wang (2006) and Lin and Yang (2014)). However, the literature usually measures energy efficiency and CO2 emissions efficiency separately. One of the most recent contributions to the evaluation of energy and carbon efficiency is Zhang et al. (2014), which propose two non-radical directional distance functions (NDDF) for conducting both energy and CO2 efficiency analysis simultaneously in a single model. Lin and Du (2015) apply this method for evaluating China's regional energy and CO2 emissions performance. They find that China's efficiencies in energy use and CO2 emissions are still at the low stage in most regions.",

First, economic unification encourages the competition among provinces, and thus enterprises have more incentives to invest in research and development (R&D) on energy efficiency. Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) develop a monopolistically competitive model to show that market size affects the toughness of competition. Grossman and Helpman (2015) also stress the importance of competition in a large scale. Second, regional integration could achieve scale economy which has been stressed by previous literature as a source of productivity growth (Tybout and Westbrook, 1995, Tybout, 2000, Biesebroeck, 2005). Third, the diffusion of technological progress and managerial experience is limited by regional barriers (C\u00f3rdova and Moreira, 2003, Peluffo, 2013), while regional integration could promote performance by eliminating the barriers. Lastly, regional integration encourages specialization according to comparative advantage (Grossman and Helpman, 2015), which has been regarded as the main source of productivity growth since Adams Smith. Due to the severe of resource depletion and global warming, the productivity incorporating energy input and CO2 emissions has become more and more important (Chen and Golley, 2014). To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature on the effect of regional integration on energy and CO2 emissions performance.",

In a country as large as China, geographical distance might be a reason for regional segmentation (indicated by price differences) rather than local protectionism.

Notably, Maoist introverted development strategy stresses the importance of regional self-sufficiency, that is, the ability for each province or region to support itself with its own resources and productions. Therefore, the borders of the 31 Chinese (mainland) provinces segment China into so many fragmented markets (Young, 2000, Poncet, 2005).",

Local protectionism might be the first reason because under the stress of mutual GDP championship, local governments tend to prevent the outflow of scarce raw factor materials to other provinces and the inflow of goods produced in other provinces. Beggar-thy-neighbour policies in each province even exaggerate local protectionism. The second reason might be rent seeking. During the planning economy period, central government distorted factor and the product pricing system in order to ensure the surviving of heavy industry. Especially, related enterprises were mainly state-owned. Price setting and state-owned enterprise (SOE) indicate that the corresponding departments have the potential for rent seeking. It is widely accepted that SOE is relatively inefficient (Song et al., 2011) and thus it needs to be protected from competition from other provinces to ensure the rents of local governments (Liu, 2012). Local governments are thus motivated to set up artificial barriers, it is harmful to domestic regional integration of Chinese provinces.",

Although market segmentation leads to local enterprises unable to take advantage of domestic market, it can be achieved through stimulating export expansion of local enterprises, relying on international markets to obtain scale economies and technological spillover (Grossman and Helpman, 2015).

By incorporating slacks into the efficiency measurement, recent studies, such as Fukuyama and Weber (2010) and Barros et al.

In addition, this method allows for incorporating the price information of various goods and obtaining a comprehensive indicator for regional integration. In the entire process of measuring Chinese regional integration depicted by Eqs. (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), there is no regression, but obtaining panel dataset by calculation.

            "text": "The reasons for controlling for these variables and their measurement are as follow. Unless otherwise noted, the raw data for constructing the control variables are collected from China Premium Database.(1)International openness (OPEN). On the one hand, international openness is beneficial for energy and/or environmental performance for several reasons, such as spillover effect, scale economy for research and development (R&D), diffusion of technology and managerial experience, see Taskin and Zaim (2001) and Lin and Du (2015). On the other hand, international openness might promote China's energy consumption and CO2 emissions because of China's exporting for energy and carbon-intensive products (Wang and Watson, 2008). Foreign investments also usually focus on energy and carbon-intensive industries, such as chemical industry (Al-mulali and Tang, 2013, Lin and Sun, 2016). In this sense, international openness might also have adverse effect, which is usually termed as \"pollution haven\" or \"pollution refuge\".In general, there are two measures for international openness. The first measure is trade openness, and the second is foreign direct investment (FDI). Either of them might only include one aspect of international openness (Mao and Sheng, 2011). We conduct a principle components analysis (PCA) to summarize the information underlying foreign trade and FDI into a single indicator for international openness. Following Du et al. (2012), we use the sum of import and export as a share of nominal GDP to present trade openness, and the share of FDI in GDP as proxy of FDI.(2)Ownership (OWN). According to the existing studies on privatization, the extent of ownership reform might affect efficiency (Song et al., 2011). We use the share of state-owned enterprise output in the gross output to measure the ownership in each province.(3)Environmental regulation (REGU). On one hand, according to the Porter hypothesis proposed by Porter and Van der Linde (1995), environmental regulation could encourage innovations and thus help improve efficiency. On the other hand, several studies suggest that the diversion of resources to the required abatement of environmental regulation would increase the cost of production and lesser resources could be used for R&D. From this point, it might be harmful for energy and CO2 emissions performance improvement. Hence, environmental regulation affects energy and CO2 emissions performance in two opposing sides and the net effect is ambiguous. Similar to Lanoie et al. (2008), we use the ratio of investment in pollution-control to the GDP to measure the magnitude of environmental regulation.(4)Energy price (PRICE). Generally speaking, higher energy price would induce energy consumers to decrease energy consumption and thus reduce CO2 emissions. Due to the diversified energy resource endowments of each region and the administrative control of the Chinese government, there is substantial difference in energy price across provinces. It is thus necessary to capture the provincial heterogeneity of energy price. Data on provincial energy price for each year are not available, following Lin and Du (2015), we use the fuel price index converted to 2000 constant price as the proxy of energy price.(5)Human capital (HMCA). Numerous studies have shown that human capital plays a key role in productivity improvement (see such as, Hall and Jones, 1999; Bowlus and Robinson, 2012). Similarly, the innovation and adoption of new technology for enhancing energy and CO2 emissions performance also depends on human capital. Referring to Hall and Jones (1999), human capital is given by e\u03d5(Si,t), where Si,t is the average years of schooling (education) of province i in year t, and \u03d5(S) reflects the efficiency of a worker with S years of schooling relative to the one with no schooling (\u03d5(0)=0). The derivative \u03d5(S)' is the return to schooling which is obtained from the estimation in Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004).(6)Fiscal expenditure (FISCAL). Government is an important participant in the economy. Government spending on education and infrastructure is beneficial for energy and CO2 emissions performance through technological progress, while the spending on political administration and military might have adverse effects because it would crowd out private expenditure (which might be invested in R&D) and lead to the distortions of resource allocation. We use the percentage of government spending in GDP to proxy the level of fiscal expenditure.\n",

            "text": "The Shephard distance function (SDF) or DDF can be identified by parametric approach and thus adopts stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) technique to estimate the efficiency. But the SFA is not appropriate for identifying NDDF used in this paper (the merit of NDDF has been discussed in Section 3.1). We provide a brief discussion on this issue.(a)Identifying Shephard distance functionSimilar to Zhou et al., 2012a, Zhou et al., 2012b, as for SDF, the distance function can be defined as:(13)DE(L,K,E,Y)=sup{\u03b8|(L,K,E/\u03b8,Y)\u2208T}\nSince SDF is linearly homogenous in energy, we have:(14)DE(L,K,E,Y)=E\u00d7DE(L,K,1,Y)\nUsing translog function proposed by Christensen et al. (1973), distance function can be expressed as:(15)lnDE(Lit,Kit,Eit,Yit)=\u03b20+\u03b21lnLit+\u03b22lnKit+\u03b23lnEit+\u03b24lnYit+\u03b25[lnLit\u00d7lnKit]+\u03b26[lnEit\u00d7lnKit]+\u03b27[lnEit\u00d7lnLit]+\u03b28[lnEit\u00d7lnYit]+\u03b29[lnLit\u00d7lnYit]+\u03b210[lnKit\u00d7lnYit]+\u03b211[lnEit]2+\u03b212[lnLit]2+\u03b213[lnKit]2+\u03b214[lnYit]2+\u03bditwhere \u03bdit is random error and \u03bdit~i.i.d\nN(0,\u03c3u2). Mathematically, translog function is more general with less parameter limitation, and can be regarded as the second Taylor approximation to an unknown function (Coelli et al., 2005).Combining linearly homogeneity property in Eq. (14), distance function in Eq. (15) can be derived as:(16)ln(1/Eit)=\u03b10+\u03b11lnLit+\u03b12lnKit+\u03b13lnYit+\u03b14[lnYit\u00d7lnLit]+\u03b15[lnYit\u00d7lnKit]+\u03b16[lnLit\u00d7lnKit]+\u03b17[lnLit]2+\u03b18[lnKit]2+\u03b19[lnYit]2\u2212uit+\u03bditwhere uit\u225clnDE(Lit,Kit,Eit,Yit)\u22650, representing the inefficiency.Energy efficiency can be measured as exp(\u2212uit). Thus, energy efficiency is connected to distance function by 1/DE(Lit,Kit,Eit,Yit).Suppose that {uit=hitui*,hit=exp(\u03b4dmintegit+Zit\u2032\u03b3),u*~N+(\u03bc,\u03c3u2)\nUsing the above translation, SDF can be identified by parametric approach, energy efficiency and its determinants can be estimated by SFA technique.(b)Identifying directional distance functionSimilar to Wang et al. (2013), as for DDF, the distance function can be defined as:(17)D(L,K,E,Y)=sub{\u03b2|(Y+\u03b2gY,C\u2212\u03b2gc)\u2208T}\nBased on F\u00e4re et al. (2005), DDF has translation properties as:(18)D(L,K,E,Y+\u03b1gY,C\u2212\u03b1gc)=D(L,K,E,Y,C)\u2212\u03b1D(L,K,E,Y+C,0)=D(L,K,E,Y,C)\u2212C\nAccording to the translation properties in Eq. (18), quadratic form is more appropriate for DDF's parametric specification, as following:(19)D(Lit,Kit,Eit,Yit,Cit)=\u03b20+\u03b21Lit+\u03b22Kit+\u03b23Eit+\u03b24Yit+\u03b25Cit+\u03b26[Kit\u00d7Lit]+\u03b27[Kit\u00d7Eit]+\u03b28[Kit\u00d7Yit]+\u03b29[Kit\u00d7Cit]+\u03b210[Lit\u00d7Eit]+\u03b211[Lit\u00d7Yit]+\u03b212[Lit\u00d7Cit]+\u03b213[Eit\u00d7Yit]+\u03b214[Eit\u00d7Cit]+\u03b215[Yit\u00d7Cit]+\u03b216[Eit]2+\u03b217[Lit]2+\u03b218[Kit]2+\u03b219[Yit]2+\u03b220[Cit]2+\u03bditwhere \u03bdit is random error and \u03bdit~i.i.d\nN(0,\u03c3u2).Combining properties in Eq. (18), distance function in Eq. (19) can be derived as:(20)\u2212Cit=\u03b10+\u03b11Kit+\u03b12Lit+\u03b13Eit\u03b15[Kit\u00d7Lit]+\u03b16[Kit\u00d7Eit]+\u03b15[Lit\u00d7Eit]+\u03b14[Yit+Cit]+\u03b14Kit\u00d7[Yit+Cit]+\u03b16Lit\u00d7[Yit+Cit]+\u03b14Eit\u00d7[Yit+Cit]+\u03b15[Kit]2+\u03b16[Lit]2+\u03b16[Eit]2+\u03b17[Yit+Cit]2\u2212uit+\u03bditwhere uit\u225cD(Lit,Kit,Eit,Yit,Cit)\u22650, representing the inefficiency. The restrictions among coefficients can be seen in F\u00e4re et al. (2005).The minimum CO2 emission in the evaluated region theoretically is (1\u2212D(Lit,Kit,Eit,Yit,Cit))\u00d7Cit, therefore efficiency can be defined as (1\u2212D(Lit,Kit,Eit,Yit,Cit)). And the distance function is parametric.Similarly, suppose that {uit=hitui*,hit=exp(\u03b4dmintegit+Zit\u2032\u03b3),u*~N+(\u03bc,\u03c3u2)\nUsing the above translation, DDF can be identified by parametric approach, efficiency and its determinants can be estimated by SFA technique.(c)Difficulty in identifying non-radial directional distance function (NDDF)\n",

A possible interpretation for the divergence might be the effects of regional segmentation on energy and CO2 emissions performance, because intuitively the performance across regions with sufficient market integration should be convergent due to the diffusion of technology and managerial experience. To better examine the effects of regional integration on UEI and ECPI, we first construct the panel dataset of regional integration, and then formally investigate its effects on UEI and ECPI in the following sections.",

A possible reason might be the central government's strive for prohibiting local protectionism (Poncet, 2005). It could be proved by a directive issued in 2001 by China's State Council in which regional blockades in market activities are regarded as outlawed.6\nSecond, the magnitude of regional integration declined dramatically in 1997, 2003\u20132004 and 2008, during the periods of Asian financial crisis (1997), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (2003\u20132004), and global financial crisis (2008). During the financial crisis of 1997 and 2008, local governments usually tend to protect local markets using artificial barriers, and in the period of the SARS, Chinese government sharply limited the flow of people and used quarantine measures to control the contagion of disease, thus regions are fragmented. Third, compared to central and western provinces, provinces in the east are less integrated. The reason for this phenomenon is that provinces located in eastern areas usually place more emphasis on international trade; while on the domestic side, interprovincial trade is only considered as residual. For province located in the interior, i.e., central and west, more emphasis is placed on interprovincial trade due to their geographical restriction to international trade or policy restriction to FDI.7\nThus, the domestic regional integration in the central and western regions is more sufficient.",

Usually, privatization is considered to enhance efficiency improvement because private sector has more incentives to improve efficiency due to competition. But for energy and CO2 emissions performance, it might not be the case. Facing the government's requirement of energy conservation and CO2 mitigation, political pressure makes state-owned enterprise to have more incentive to achieve the requirement. (iii) The effects of fuel price on energy and CO2 emissions performance are ambiguous and statistically insignificant. This might be indicative of the administrative control on energy prices (Lin and Li, 2014). This is because compared with the product markets, factor markets in China are still distorted and the prices of energy are controlled even decided by the Chinese government. (iv) The coefficients of environmental regulation are significantly negative. As discussed above, environmental regulation has two opposing effects. The results imply that its net effect contributes to more energy use and CO2 emissions because the diversion of resources to the required abatement might reduce the resources that could be used for R&D.

We propose the instrumental variable method to address the issue of reverse causality. Similar to Lin and Du (2015), the lag terms of regional integration are employed as the instrumental variables. The intuition underlying this strategy is similar to the idea of General Moment Method (GMM) for dynamic panel model.

Recall that, the positive effects of regional integration on energy and CO2 emissions performance are based on four reasons, i.e., (i) the increased competition encourages enterprises to invest in energy efficiency R&D; (ii) the expanded markets achieve scale economy; (iii) lowered barriers lead to technological diffusion; and (iv) comparative advantage through specialization. Provinces with more international openness might have achieved the four mechanisms through international markets, which means that international integration could substitute domestic integration in terms of energy and CO2 emissions performance.

The performance gaps among regions have become larger indicating that the performance is divergent across provinces. This is indicative of regional segmentation because in a sufficiently integrated market, the performance should be convergent due to technological diffusion.\u2022In general, the magnitude of regional integration has increased dramatically which might be the result of the central government's strive for prohibiting local protectionism. At the local level, provinces located in the eastern areas are less integrated on the domestic side, which might be explained by their convenience to international openness due to geographic location and preferential policies.\u2022Regional integration has significant and quantitatively substantial positive effects on energy and CO2 emissions performance, and the results are quite robust to alternative indicators, samples and methods. In addition, over 70% of the effects are attributed to artificial barriers, rather than geographical distance.\u2022International openness (or named as international integration) is also beneficial for promoting energy and CO2 emissions performance. However, this cannot substitute domestic regional integration because of China's specialization in energy-intensive manufacturing in the global economy (by exporting energy-intensive commodities in trade openness or becoming \"pollution refuge\" in FDI openness).\n",
