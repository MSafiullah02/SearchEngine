On March 27, 2020 (week 13, day 6), our Department of Radiology issued guidelines for appropriate use of imaging in the emergency, inpatient, and outpatient settings. All nonurgent imaging was avoided in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, if possible. The guidelines also recommended avoiding imaging procedures, when possible, that required health care providers to be in close contact with patients with COVID-19, such as ultrasound and interventional procedures. In the inpatient setting, the guidelines emphasized limiting imaging to those procedures that could not safely be performed in an outpatient setting after discharge. In particular, the judicious use of chest CT imaging in patients with COVID-19 was suggested for hospitalized symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications (ie, concern for bacterial superinfection, intubation-related barotrauma, etc).",

Imaging volume deterioration also varied by modality type, with the greatest declines observed at week 16 in mammography (94%), followed in descending order by nuclear medicine (85%), MRI (74%), ultrasound (64%), interventional radiology (56%), CT (46%), and x-ray (22%).",

            "text": "There are significant economic implications on radiology groups and health care systems mainly due to the resultant combined lost revenue and staffing needs [6] during the pandemic. Several policy changes have been enacted to limit the transmission of COVID-19 disease. Federal and state governments have mandated nonessential business closures and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders. In addition, health care policies have recommended to pause elective and routine medical services, particularly surgical procedures and imaging examinations. However, individual behavior and actions have also contributed to the decline in imaging case volumes. The general public is hesitant to visit any health care facility in fear of getting exposed to the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in particular the emergency department [7]. This has raised concerns regarding the potential adverse health outcomes in patients delaying care for emergent conditions, such as acute stroke, myocardial infarction, appendicitis, and so on.",

Thus, many practices will need to make short-term changes to survive this period and permanent changes to the radiology practice model may be necessary in the long term [6]. In particular, radiology groups that are mainly comprised of outpatient imaging will be most severely affected according to anecdotal evidence [6] and the real-world data presented in this study.",

It is possible that imaging case volumes for some CPT codes or clinical indications changed more than others. Another limitation is that our health care institution is located in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic potentially limiting the generalizability of these results. With nationwide spread of COVID-19 disease, it is likely that almost every region will directly or indirectly experience the impact of this pandemic. Even though these results may serve as a worst-case scenario, specific analyses of imaging case volumes in less severely affected regions would be warranted for comprehensive evaluation.",
