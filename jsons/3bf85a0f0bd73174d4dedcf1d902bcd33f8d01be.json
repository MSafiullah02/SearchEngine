To uncover the dynamical mechanisms, spatio-temporal evolving patterns and critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading is extremely important, which provides some theoretical foundations for us to control epidemic spreading, to predict collective behaviors in social systems, and so on. The coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much attentions in many disciplines. In this review, we introduce recent progresses of coevolution spreading dynamics, emphasizing the contributions from the perspective of statistical mechanics and network science. The theoretical methods, critical phenomena, phase transitions, interacting mechanisms and effects of network topology for four representative types of coevolution spreading mechanisms, including the coevolution of biology contagions, social contagions, epidemic-awareness and epidemicresources, are presented detailedly, and the challenges in this field as well as open issues for future studies are also discussed. , \u03bb QMF c , \u03bb DMP c and simulation results \u03bb c versus network size N are extensively compared for networks with power-law exponent \u03b3 D = 2.1 (a) and \u03b3 D = 3.5 (b).

When investigating the spreading dynamics, scientists wish to know some important problems such as what are the dynamical mechanisms behind the phenomena, whether there will be an outbreak, how many individuals will be infected, when an individual will be infected, and how to effectively predict and contain the spreading. Once those problems are well addressed, there are many beneficial aspects for our society. For the governments, the situations of epidemic can be apperceived, and effective containing measures could be provided [9] .

Other frequently-observed features that cannot be well captured by the oversimplified models include small-world property, community structure, multiplexity, spatiality, temporality, and so on [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 27, 29, 30] .

            "text": "The propagations of diseases, behaviors and information in real world are rarely independent to each other, yet they are coevolving with strong interactions. Coevolution spreading widely exists with important practical relevance [52] . For example, the HIV results in lower immunity of virus carriers, who are therefore more susceptible to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58] . The propagation of disease-related information in social media could largely suppress the spreading of the corresponding epidemic disease [59] . An extremely important case is that in the early stage of the spreading of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, an unofficial message entitled 'There is a fatal flu in Guangzhou' was send to tens of millions of individuals [60] . As a result, individuals adopted simple but effective actions (e.g., staying home or wearing face masks) to protect themselves from being infected by SARS, which greatly decreases the final number of infected individuals. To uncover and understand the interacting mechanisms, spatio-temporal evolving patterns, critical phenomena and phase transitions of networked coevolution spreading, scientists have already made much efforts. The complex interactions during the coevolving dynamics lead to rich phase transition phenomena and novel physics, such as the coexisting thresholds caused by competitive interactions [61] and the discontinuous phase transition caused by synergetic interactions [62] . In addition, the multiscale structure of networks remarkably affects the criticality of spreading dynamics, not only the value of thresholds, but also the critical exponents [63] and the type of phase transitions [64] . Therefore, the coevolution spreading dynamics on complex networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years.",

            "text": "There are three reasons for us to write this review. Firstly, a large number of papers about coevolution spreading dynamics have emerged recently, but there is still a lack of a comprehensive review to systematically sort out these results, discuss major challenges at the current stage, and point out open issues for future studies. Secondly, the early literature used different ways of expressions to describe essentially the same mathematical problems and methods. It is thus urgent to unify the problem description and the symbolic system. Thirdly, some researchers have already tried to find some potential applications, while these application possibilities are scattered in disparate fields, lacking of integration. Ac-cordingly, this review will be helpful to researchers already in the field, those who intend to enter the field and those who wish to apply the related findings, and this review will also contribute to the further development of the field.",

Four representative types of networked coevolution spreading are under consideration, including the coevolution of biology contagions, social contagions, awareness-epidemic and resources-epidemic. In Section 2, we will introduce the coevolution spreading of biology contagions, in which each contact between susceptible and infected nodes may trigger the transmission of infection. We mainly focus on the most representative biology contagions, i.e., epidemic spreading. However, in the spreading processes for political information, innovative products and new drugs, a single contact is not enough to eliminate the risk of adopting for susceptible individuals, thus multiple contacts are necessary. The coevolution spreading of social contagions are presented in Section 3, which focuses on the spreading dynamics involving the above social reinforcement effects. To contain the epidemic, some coevlution spreading strategies are developed. In Section 4 and Section 5, we will respectively introduce the coevolution of awareness and epidemic, and the coevolution of resources and epidemic. Finally, in Section 6 we will draw the landscape of this emerging field, summarize representative progresses, and make some outlooks about current challenges and future open issues in this field.",

            "text": "Empirically, the epidemic spreading, virus spreading, and information diffusion are usually modelled as biology contagions, where a single activated source can be sufficient for infection transmission [2, 15, 65] . Susceptible-infectedsusceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) are the most representative models for biology contagions in networks [15, 66] . For the reversible SIS model, a node can be in susceptible or infected state. At each time step, each infected node tries to transmit the infection to every susceptible neighbor with rate \u03b2, and then returns into susceptible with rate \u03b3. For the irreversible SIR model, each infected node also tries to infect every susceptible neighbor with rate \u03b2. The difference is that the infected node will then become recovered with rate \u03b3. The recovered node will not participate in the remaining spreading process. The effective transmission rate is denoted as \u03bb = \u03b2/\u03b3. Other well-known models for biology contagions include susceptible-infected (SI) model [67, 68] , susceptibleinfected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model [69, 70] , contact process [71, 72] , and so on. Without specific statements, this section focuses on SIS and SIR models (others are similar).",

Within the traditional framework for well-mixed population of homogeneous networks (e.g., random networks and regular lattices), such long lifetime suggested that the effective transmission rate is much larger than the epidemic threshold. As the same, the average fraction of infected population is very small, which in contrast suggests a small value of effective transmission rate in the traditional framework.

Since many real networks are scale-free with power-law exponent no larger than 3 [78] (see also a related interesting comment in Ref.

For example, if there is only one seed node, the dynamical correlations are obvious since the contagion path has the same source, and the epidemic transmission events to one node coming from two neighbors may be correlated [97] . To overcome the weaknesses of the quench mean-field approach but retain its advantages, i.e., to take into consideration the full network structure, the dynamic message-passing approach was proposed by Karrer and Newman [98] to study the SIR model, and generalized later by Shrestha et al. to describe the SIS model [99] . By disallowing a node in the 'cavity' state from transmitting an infection to its neighbors but allows it to be infected by them, the 'echo chamber' [100, 101, 102] (i.e., a node is reinfected by a neighbor it previously infected) is reduced the dynamic message-passing approach. The dynamic message-passing approach predicts the epidemic threshold is \u03bb c = 1/\u039b B , where B is the non-backtracking matrix. Note that B is a 2M \u00d72M nonsymmetrix matrix with rows and columns indexed by directed edges i \u2190 j, where M is the number of edges. The element of B is",

Recent studies showed that the dynamic message-passing approach well predicts the epidemic spreading dynamics on uncorrelated local-tree like networks [98, 99, 103] , and has also found wide applications in epidemic containing [97] , locating spreading sources [104, 105] , influence maximization [89] , and network dismantling [106, 107, 108] . However, the dynamic message-passing approach needs 2E +N differential equations, which is time-consuming for large networks. And some simplified approaches have been developed, such as edge-based compartmental approach, which only uses 4 differential equations to describe the dynamics, and well predicts the dynamics on configuration networks [109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114] . The pairwise approximation approach is another well-known approach to capture the dynamic correlations by considering the evolution of pair states, instead of states of individual nodes [115, 116] . It requires k 2 max equations to describe the dynamics even assuming that nodes of the same degree are statistically the same [117, 118, 119, 120] , and if it treats every node differently, N + E equations are needed [121] . It is also too complicated for large-scale networks. Another disadvantage is that the pairwise approximation approach usually cannot show an analytical expression of the epidemic threshold, but just a numerical value. Beside, other approaches were proposed for some specific dynamics, including the master equations [122, 123, 124] , Langevin approach [83] , and other generalized ones [125, 126, 127] . Unfortunately none of these approaches can adequately describe both the full topology of a network and its dynamic correlations. The continuous-time Markov approach produces exact solution for epidemic spreading dynamics by using the transform matrix generator Q q N \u00d7q N , but it can only address several specific models since the generator Q q N \u00d7q N is difficult to be obtained and in practice one cannot solve the N N equations [128, 129, 130, 131] .",

In an assortative network (i.e., with positive degree-degree correlation), large-degree nodes tend to connect with large-degree nodes and smalldegree nodes tend to connect with small-degree nodes, while in a disassortative network (i.e., with negative degree-degree correlation), large-degree nodes tend to connect with small-degree nodes and vice versa. Bogu\u00f1\u00e1 et al. [140] found that the epidemic threshold vanishes in the thermodynamic limit of scale-free networks with power-law exponent 2 < \u03b3 D \u2264 3, whatever the two-point degree correlations are assortative or disassortative mixing patterns. Specifically, the epidemic threshold is \u03bb c = 1/\u039b m , where \u039b m is the largest eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix C kk \u2032 = kP (k \u2032 |k) and P (k \u2032 |k) is the probability that an edge belonging to a node with degree k connects to a node with degree k \u2032 [141] . Bogu\u00f1\u00e1 and Pastor-Satorras further demonstrated the epidemic threshold \u03bb c can be shifted to a finite value when the networks have higher-order correlations [142] . Moreno et al. showed that the assortativity hinders the outbreak size of epidemic spreading [143] . Schl\u00e4pfer and Buzna found that the spreading dynamics becomes slow in positively (negatively) correlated networks if hubs accelerate (decelerate) the spreading [144] .

Eames [154] and Miller [155] also claimed that the clustering reduces epidemic size and increases the epidemic threshold, and Miller [156] further revealed that network clustering is the primary factor in controlling the growth rate of epidemic spreading. However, the effects of clustering seem dependent on the underlying network models, for example, studies on random scale-free networks with high clustering coefficients showed that the high clustering cannot restore a finite epidemic threshold [157] . In a solvable model, Newman theoretically proved that the higher clustering will lead to even lower epidemic threshold since the redundant paths introduced by the triangles in the network provide more opportunities for the susceptible nodes to be infected [158] . Wang et al. [159] revealed that there is a double transition when epidemic spreads on networks with cliques.",

Generally speaking, nodes within a community are densely connected while nodes between communities are sparsely connected. Liu and Hu [173] studied the epidemic spreading on simplified community networks and found that the epidemic threshold fulfills \u03bb c (p/q) \u2212 \u03bb c (\u221e) \u223c q/p, where p and q respectively stands for the connecting probability of links within a community and between communities, and \u03bb c (\u221e) is the outbreak threshold when there are only edges in the communities. Till far, the effects of community structure on spreading dynamics are controversial. Chen et al. [174] found that the overlapping community structure promotes the epidemic prevalence. However, Huang and Li [175] claimed that strong community structure will suppress the epidemic prevalence. Recently, Stegehuis et al. [176] studied the SIR model on real-world networks, and suggested that the community structure can enforce epidemic spreading since some communities are of star-like structure and at the same time, they claimed that community structure may inhibit the spreading since some communities can act as traps for an epidemic process across a network. It is also worth to mention the observation that community structure will dramatically affect the epidemic predictability and variability [177] .",

            "text": "In simple networks, edges are binary (i.e., with existent or not), while in many real networks, interacting strengths between different node pairs are largely different, and thus edges are associated with weights to represent their strengths [178, 179] . Treating a simple network as a special weighted network with each edge associated with weight 1, it is obvious that real weighted networks are always of more heterogeneous weight distributions than that of a simple network. Indeed, scientists have demonstrated that the heterogeneity of weight distribution markedly affect the epidemic dynamics, including both epidemic threshold and epidemic prevalence [180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188] . Among the earliest works, Yan et al. [180] proposed a simple model for epidemic spreading on weighted networks, where the infection transmission rate through an edge with weight w ij is \u03b2 ij = (w ij /w max ) \u03b1p , where w max is the largest weight of all edges, and \u03b1 p is a positive parameter. Through extensive numerical simulations based on an artificial weighted network model [189] , Yan et al. [180] showed that nodes with larger strengths (a node's strength is defined by the sum of all weights of its associated edges) are preferential to be infected. Xu et al. [190] proposed a toy model where a fraction f of edges are of weight w 1 and the remaining edges are of weights w 0 \u2264 w 1 . For an infected node, it preferences to select a neighbor according to P ij = w ij / j\u2208N i w ij to transmit the infection with probability \u03b2, where N i is the neighbor set of node i. The epidemic prevalence shows a non-monotonic behavior, and the epidemic prevalence drops with f for small f and increases for large f . Cui et al. [191] analyzed a weighted SIS model on six real networks, suggesting that the weight-weight correlation strongly affects the dynamical behaviors: high-weight edges are more significant in keeping high epidemic prevalence when the weight-weight correlation is positive. To accurately predict the epidemic spreading on weighted networks, Kamp et al. [185] and Rattana et al. [186] developed the pairwise approximation approach, which needs O(k 2 max w 2 max ) equations to govern the dynamical system. This method only works if the weights are integers and it is very time-consuming to solve the equations if the weights are broadly distributed. Wang et al. [188] developed a much faster approach for networks with general degree and weight distributions, that is, an edge-weight-based compartmental approach. Their approach produces a remarkable agreement with numerical results. The outbreak threshold decreases with the decreasing of the heterogeneity of weigh distribution, as shown in Fig. 2(a) . Once the average degree k is given, increasing the heterogeneity of degree distribution can promote the epidemic prevalence at small \u03bb while it suppresses the epidemic prevalence at large \u03bb as shown in Fig. 2(b) . Yang and Zhou [183] analyzed a weighted SIS epidemic spreading model on homogeneous networks with heterogeneous weight distribution P w (w) \u223c w \u2212\u03b3 W , where \u03b3 W is the exponent of weight distribution, w min = 1 and w max = 10 4 are given. They developed an edge-based mean-field theory and revealed that a more homogeneous weight distribution will result in a higher epidemic prevalence.",

            "text": "Some real-world systems are better characterized by multilayer networks (also named as multiplex networks, network of network, interdependent networks in the literature) [28, 43, 192] . A multilayer network is consisted of a few subnetworks (usually two or three subnetworks, each is called a layer), each has its own organizing rules and functions, different from others, while nodes in different layers may have strong interactions that can be described by cross-layer edges. For example, Internet and power grid seem to be two independent networks, but indeed power station supplies electric power to servers of Internet while Internet servers provide some fundamental functions (e.g., control, communication and data ac-quisition) for power stations [193] . Another typical example is transportation systems, where railway networks, air transportation networks and public transportation networks are tightly cooperating to serve for travels [194] . Saumell-Mendiola et al. [195] studied the SIS model on interconnected networks. Through a generalized heterogeneous mean-field theory, they found that the global endemic state may occur even though the epidemics cannot outbreak on each network separately. While for the SIR model on interconnected networks, the epidemic will occur on both subnetworks when the coupling is strong enough, otherwise, a mixed phase exists [196] . In real-world social communication platforms, individuals can only use one of them, such as Twitter, while some individuals may use more than one platforms. If we treat each platform as a subnetwork of multiplex network, those individuals who only use one platform are not exist in all subnetworks (or layers). To investigate how this situation affects the spreading dynamics, Buono et al. [197] assumed that only a fraction of f nodes exist in two layers. In this case, the epidemic threshold is determined by the topology of multiplex networks when f > 0. The epidemic threshold depends on the smaller isolated threshold, i.e., the outbreak threshold when the epidemic spreads on each subnetworks separately, when f \u2192 0. Using an N-intertwined mean-field approximation approach, Wang et al. found that the epidemic threshold is \u03bb c = 1/\u039b 1 (A + \u03b1B), where \u039b 1 (A + \u03b1B) is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix A + \u03b1B, A and B respectively represents the adjacent matrix of two subnetworks, and \u03b1 and \u03b1\u03bb respectively stands for the infection transmission rate of an edge in and between subnetworks [198] . Cozzo et al. [199] developed a discrete Markovian chain approach to describe the spreading dynamics, and found the epidemic threshold is determined by the maximal value of the isolated leading eigenvalue of two layers. Arruda et al. [200] found epidemic spreading on multilayer networks has localization phenomenon. Recently, Liu et al. [27] constructed two multiplex contact networks from high-resolution sociodemographic data in Italian and Dutch population, and showed that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number is untenable in realistic populations due to the multiplex and clustered contact structure of the population. More recent progresses for epidemic spreading on multilayer networks are presented in reviews [44, 49, 51] .",

            "text": "In some real systems, network topologies are time-varying, which can be described by temporal networks [30, 201] . Karsai et al. [202] proposed an activitydriven network to model the temporal networks, where each node i is assigned an activity potential x i independently drawn from a given probability distribution F (x), and will be active with probability a i \u2206t = \u03b7x i \u2206t in each time step, where \u03b7 is a constant. Each active node generates m edges to connect with m randomly selected nodes. At the next time step, all existent edges are deleted and the newly active nodes will generates edges to form a new network. For the SIS model on the proposed temporal networks, the epidemic threshold is \u03bb c = 2 a /( a + a 2 ), where a and a 2 are the first and second moments of a i respectively. The results indicated that temporal networks are more robust to epidemic spreading than integrated static networks. Further analysis on this activity-driven model showed that the memory inhibits the spreading of SIR model while promotes the spreading of SIS model [203] . Nadini et al. [204] revealed that the time-varying modular structure inhibits SIR process, but speeds up SIS process. Karsai et al. [205] found that strong ties in temporal networks suppress the spreading dynamics. Liu et al. [206] studied the SIS spreading process on time-varying multiplex networks, and found that strong multiplexity (i.e., the fraction of overlapping nodes) significantly reduces the epidemic threshold. Valdano et al. [207] proposed an analytical computation approach for the epidemic threshold on temporal networks, yielding an excellent agreement with extensive numerical simulations. Speidel et al. [208] demonstrated that temporal interactions facilitate endemicity of SIS model.",

            "text": "Cooperation between two epidemic spreading dynamics means that a node is infected by one epidemic will increase the probability that this node is infected by the other epidemic. Such cooperative effect is also called as synergy effect. For example, once a person is infected by HIV/AIDS, his/her immunity system will be greatly destroyed, thus the probability that he/she gets infected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), syphilis, hepatitis will be increased. Conversely, once a person infected by the later diseases (e.g., SLE) has sex with HIV/AIDS patient, his/her infection probability will increase. Cai et al. [62] proposed a coevolution SIR spreading model with cooperative effect between two epidemics, where a node not yet been infected will be infected by one of the two epidemics with probability \u03bb 1 , and a node being already infected by one epidemic will be infected by the other with probability \u03bb 2 > \u03bb 1 . The two epidemics have the same recovery probability. The recovered nodes acquire immunity against the epidemic they had, but not to the other epidemic. Extensive numerical simulations are performed on ER networks with average degree k = 4. Two order parameters, namely the probability P of forming a giant infected cluster and the fraction \u03c1 of nodes belonging to the giant connected cluster, are used to describe the phase transition. The system undergoes a discontinuous transition with hybrid type. At the critical point, the system already has a finite fraction of infected cluster. The fraction \u03c1 ab of nodes being infected by both epidemics 1 and 2 exhibits a discontinuous phase transition for a give \u03bb 2 , as shown in Fig. 6 . Furthermore, the system undergoes a typical continuous transition on 2-dimensional lattices. Specifically, the critical behavior is P \u223c \u03c1 ab \u223c (\u03bb 1 \u2212 \u03bb 1 c ) \u03b1e where \u03b1 e \u2248 5/36. Grassberger et al. further discussed the roles of network topology on the phase transition [229] , and revealed that loops are crucial for the emergence of a discontinuous transition. For cooperative spreading dynamics on 2-dimensional lattices with local contacts or on BA networks, there is no discontinuous transition. However, the discontinuous transition always appears for cooperative contagions on 2-dimensional lattices with long range connection, on 4-dimensional lattices and on ER networks. Chen et al. further investigated the fundamental properties of cooperative contagion processes of two SIS epidemics [230, 231] . Assuming that a node being infected by one epidemic has larger infection rate once it is already infected by another epidemic. Mathematically, assuming the spreading dynamics on well-mixed populations, and the system exhibited discontinuous phase transition. Chen et al. [232] computed the critical parameters by using a mean-field approach, and found two distinct thresholds for system with hysteresis.",

Polarized immunity means that partial cross-immunity makes some individuals be totally immunized.

For epidemic l, its infection and recovery rates are \u03b2 l and \u03b3 l respectively.

If node i is infected by more than one epidemic, it can only transmit one of its infected epidemics to a neighbor j.

Therefore, biology contagions are also named as simple contagions. There is another kind of spreading phenomena, such as the diffusion of innovations, the spread of cultural fads, the adoption of behaviors and the outbreak of political protests, where the multiple exposures are required before the adoption because of the validity of its credibility, legitimacy and risk. Thus, a single contact is not enough to trigger the above-stated spreading phenomena, i.e., successive contacts are necessary being interdependent. This class of spreading processes is named as social contagions or complex contagions, which cannot be well captured by simple contagions. The ubiquity of social contagions in the real world demands to revisit most of the dynamical settings and the network structures that have been already addressed. As in the case of the biology contagions, the main concern of this section is also about how different kinds of interplay impacts the coevolution of two or more social contagions, such as the cooperation between two kinds of behavior adoptions.",

As a generalization of the classical Watts threshold model [249] , we also address the spreading threshold model and introduce the relevant progresses. The interest in this part lies on uncovering how the dynamical mechanisms and the network structures affect the social contagions. The second part is devoted to the interaction of two social contagions. Here, we will revisit the models established to capture the successively and the simultaneously social contagions on complex networks. Our main concern is how the mutual interactions impact the threshold and the type of phase transitions. In the final part, we will generalize the two interacting social contagions to the interactions of multiple social contagions empirically and theoretically. This will be quite challenging since the interactions of them become more complicated and also it is more important since they are widely observed in natural, social and technological systems.",

            "text": "One of the key issues in network science is to understand, predict and finally control the dynamics of social contagion processes on complex networks. As early as in 1973, Granovetter showed that the information spreading through 'weak ties' between casual acquaintances will be faster than it diffusing through 'strong ties' among the close friends [250] . This is because the weak ties are usually the edges connecting distant nodes, which can speed up the spreading. Weak ties theory explained the rapid spread of the HIV disease and information well, however it can not give the reason why it fails when using the contagion of the preventative measures to stop the HIV disease [251] on the same network. This is mainly because of the difference between the spread of the infectious disease and the contagion of the preventative measures, where the former is a simple contagion and one infected individual is sufficient to reproduce the infection, while the latter is a social contagion and the multiple sources of activations are required since this kind of spread is usually uncertain, risky and costly. In this subsection, we will revisit the progress of the empirical analyses that reveal the potential mechanism, i.e., social reinforcement, of social behavior adoptions and the established mathematical models for the single social contagion in complex networks.",

            "text": "The rapid development of the Internet technology makes the large-scale of social experiments on online social networks possible. Centola [252] recruited 1528 participants online and tested the effects of the network structure on the contagion of health behavior. By comparing the health behavior spreading in the regular clustered network and the random network (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 9 ), Centola found the behavior spreads farther and faster across the regular networks than the random networks since the participants can receive the social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the former network (as presented in the right panel of Fig. 9 ). This is largely different from the results of biology contagions where clustered structure will usually depress the spreading. To investigate the robustness of Centola's experiment, L\u00fc et al. [253] proposed an unknown-knownapproved-exhausted model, which emphasizes the effect of social reinforcement by incorporating the mechanism that the redundant signals can increase the approval rate. They found in some certain conditions, the information spreads faster and broader in regular clustered network than in random network, which to some extent supports the results of Centola's experiments. However, increasing the network size tends to favor the effective spreading in the random network which challenges the validity of the above-mentioned experiment for larger-scale systems. Besides, they found introducing a little randomness into the regular network will yield the most effective information spreading. Similar to Ref. [253] , Zheng et al. [254] further claimed that increasing the network size or decreasing the average degree will enlarge the difference of the final fraction of approved nodes between regular and random networks. Smoking behaviors explicitly bring the effects to the people around the smokers, as a return they also impact the initiation and the cessation of the smoking [255, 256] . Christakis and Fowler studied the effect of peer influences on the quitting behaviors by analyzing a network of 12,067 people who underwent repeated assessments of their smoking behavior and socialnetwork ties over a period of 32 years [257] . They found the likelihood for a smoker to quit smoking behavior depends on their exposures to the multiple contacts of the nonsmokers. The social reinforcement in encouraging smokers to abstain is also found online. Myneni et al. [258] found that smokers are more likely to abstain if they are exposed to several abstinent users by examining peer inter-actions over QuitNet-a social media platform for smokers attempting to quit. A series of other studies also demonstrated that the effects of social reinforcement from the peers were strengthened when the peers come from different social groups, exhibit the value of structural diversity and share some key characteristics with the ego in the dynamics of social contagion [259, 260, 261, 262, 263] .",

Granovetter [284] proposed the linear threshold model, where all individuals are with states: active or inactive, and an individual becomes active if and only if the current absolute number of active neighbors is equal to or exceeds the corresponding threshold. As the real-world networks are very heterogenous, within the framework of linear threshold, hub nodes are too vulnerable. To fill this weakness, Watts takes into account the heterogeneity of individuals' number of contacts and puts forward a novel threshold model (named as Watts threshold model later) [249] . In the model, each node is initially assigned a threshold \u03c6 randomly draw from a distribution h(\u03c6). When the fraction of active neighbors of a node is equal to or exceeds its threshold \u03c6, it becomes active. Adopting the fraction of active neighbors instead of the absolute number is the essential difference compared with linear threshold model. The function h(\u03c6) can be defined arbitrary but satisfies the condition",

A remarkable result is that if all individuals are of the same adoption threshold, the final adoption size first grows continuously and then decreases discontinuously as the increase of the average degree. Meanwhile, the global cascade occurs more easily in the network with more heterogeneous degree distribution. In modeling the propagation of opinions, the diffusion of innovations and the adoption of behaviors, the Watts threshold model is well recognized as the fundamental model. Similar to the epidemic spreading dynamics, researchers have explored the social contagion on complex networks based on Watts threshold model for two aspects. One is to reveal the effects of network topology and the other is to understand the mechanisms of diffusion at the individual-level. Clustering measures the edge density among neighbors of an individual, which plays a key role in epidemic spreading. One manifest conclusion is that high clustering will suppress the epidemic spreading, leading to the increase of the epidemic threshold and the decrease the infection size [84, 153] . In investigating the effect of clustering on the adoption of behaviors, Ikeda et al. [287] studied the Watts threshold model on a clustered network generated from a projection of bipartite graphs and compared it to a non-clustered network with the same degree distribution. Similar to the spreading of health behavior [252, 253, 254] , the global cascades occur more easily on clustered networks than on non-clustered networks [287] . Hackett et al. [288] explored the cascade on the clustered networks produced by the configuration model with adjustable clustering [158] , and found there exists a range of k in which increasing the clustering of the network results in the increase of the mean cascade size, while out of this range it will decrease the mean cascade size. Hackett and Glesson [289] further explored the cascade phenomena on the highly clustered clique-based graphs [290] and obtained the closed-form expression for the final fraction of active nodes inside a clique of arbitrary size.",

They found if the seeds are contained in one of the communities initially, the peaks of the activation dynamics in each community are well-separated in time. Curato and Lillo [295] used the linear threshold model to explore the optimal structure of a network consisting of two communities which can maximize the asymptotic extent of the diffusion. They found the optimal structure can be assortative, core-periphery or even disassortative when the average degree and the fraction of initiators are constrained. In looking for a minimal fraction of initially seeds needed to trigger a global cascade, they showed that the optimal network is a very dense community linked to a much more sparsely connected periphery. The impact of community structure on the cascade processes based on the Watts threshold model has been theoretically studied by Nematzadeh et al. [296] . They constructed a network model with two homogeneous modules, where the internal connectivities of the two communities are the same, and one parameter, i.e., the fraction of edges between the two communities, is used to control the strength of the community structure. The optimal network modularity is existed, at which the cascade size is maximized. This study has been extended to the case of the network with multiple modular communities [297] , where the similar results are found that the modular structures facilitate cascade and the optimal modularity is existed.",

In the case of \u03b1 p > 0 (\u03b1 p < 0), the edge strength decreases (increases) as the increase of the product of the connectivities k and k \u2032 . In the case of \u03b1 p > 0 (\u03b1 p < 0), the edge strength decreases (increases) as the increase of the product of the connectivities k and k \u2032 . The cascade window (i.e., the range of k that global behavioral adoptions occur) is shifted to higher values when \u03b1 p > 0 since highly connected nodes have relatively less influences on their neighbors.

Compared with contagion on the simple network that has the same topology but without considering the multiplexity, Brummitt et al. found that the multilayer network has a higher probability to encounter the global cascade. Yagan and Gligor [301] proposed a content-dependent linear threshold model for social contagion in multiplex networks. In this model, each edge type i is associated with a content-dependent parameter c i in [0, \u221e] that measures the relative bias that type i has in propagating this content. An inactive node turns to be active if the total perceived influences, i.e., c i m i / c i k i , where m i and k i respectively represent the number of active neighbors and the number of neighbors in type i, exceeds its threshold \u03c6. The authors showed that the content and edge types are important in characterizing the global cascade. Zhuang et al. [302] studied the content-dependent linear threshold model on the clustered multiplex networks, and found the clustering plays a double-faceted role on the cascade processes, where the clustering decreases the cascade size when the average degree of the network is small, while it facilitates the cascades when the average degree is large. Along this line, Lee et al. [303] studied the effect of individuals' heterogenous responses of Watts threshold model in multiplex networks. Two types of responses are introduced. In the first type, an individual becomes active if in at least one layer a sufficiently large fraction of neighbors is active. In the second type, an individual becomes active only if in every layer, the fraction of active neighbors is sufficiently large. They showed that varying the fractions of nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Furthermore, they found the global cascades become discontinuously near the inhibition regime, and the cascade size grows slowly when the networks density increases. Li et al. [304] explored the cross-layers cascade process in multiplex networks. They found the multiplexity speeds up the cascade if the additional layer can provide the extra short paths for the rapid spreading.",

The randomization of time stamps makes the cascade larger for the fractional-threshold mechanism [249] , while it makes the cascades smaller in the case of absolute-threshold mechanism [284] . Takaguchi et al. [306] also studied linear threshold model on empirical temporal networks incorporated with the decaying mechanism of the exposures and showed that the burst activity patterns facilitate the contagion. However, in another study of linear threshold model on the empirical temporal networks, Bachlund et al. [307] found that some networks support cascades, while some do not. Their further analysis manifested that there exists the competition between the inhibition effect of the burst activity patterns and the promotion effect of the timing correlations between contacts on adjacent edges. Some specific models incorporating the underlying mechanism that affects the behavioral adoption of individuals are also established. Melnik et al. [308] purposed a multi-stage social contagion model accounting for the fact that individuals in different stages of the spreading process exert different levels of influences on their neighbors, which can reproduce the multi-stage cascade phenomena. Liu et al. [309] considered a specific situation, where individuals in the network have several opinion leaders, who affect the behaviors of themselves markedly. The impact of opinion leaders makes the global cascades occur more easily, which can not only reduce the lowest average degree of the network required for the global cascade, but also increase the highest average degree of the network that the global cascade can occur. Kobayshi [310] generalized the Watts threshold model with the trend-driven mechanism, which introduces another type of nodes, the global nodes whose states depend on the fraction of the activated nodes in the population. When the fraction of activated nodes in the population exceeds a threshold, a trend emerges and the global nodes become active. Kobayshi showed that the global nodes accelerate the cascades once a trend emerges while their existences reduce the probability of the emergence of a trend. Accordingly, there exists a moderate fraction of global nodes that maximizes the average size of cascades. The persuasion mechanism which can strength the ability of the activated nodes' ability to convince his/her neighbors to adopt the behavior is also considered in the Watts threshold model purposed by Huang et al. [311] . They found such introduced mechanism can cause the networks to become more vulnerable to the global cascades, especially in the heterogeneous networks. Ruan et al. [312] generalized the Watts threshold model with mechanisms of spontaneous adoption and complete reluctance to adoption (i.e., immune or blocked node). They showed that speed of spreading depends strongly on the density of blocked nodes. When the fraction of blocked nodes is small, the spontaneous adopters are able to generate a large cascade. When the fraction of blocked nodes is large, since the spontaneous adopters dominate the spreading, only the small cascade can be generated and the spreading becomes slow. Juul and Porter [313] incorporated the synergy effects in Watts threshold model, and found the constructive synergy (i.e., the peer pressure experienced by a node is larger than it in Watts threshold model) speeds up the contagion process and the interfering synergy (i.e., the peer pressure experienced by a node is less than it in Watts threshold model) slows down the contagion process. Oh and Porter [314] accounted for the case that individuals will wait for some amount of time before they adopt a behavior. Their results indicated that heterogeneously-distributed timers can change the adoption order of nodes, either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions.",

At time step t, assume a susceptible individual u of degree k already has m \u2212 1 pieces of information, and once u receives another piece of information, the probability that it adopts the behavior is \u03c0(k, m). Therein, \u03c0(k, m) is a non-negative function of k and m, which has the largest value equal to 1. The adopted individual becomes recovered with probability \u03b3. Individuals in the recovered state do not participate in the spreading dynamics. The edge-based compartmental theory is established, where a variable \u03b8(t) represents the probability that individual v has not transmitted the information to a neighbor along a randomly chosen edge by time t. The evolution equation of \u03b8(t) is written as",

[317] took the limited contact capacity of individuals in transmitting the information and suggested that enlarging the contact capacity makes the global adoption more easy to occur. Considering the heterogeneity of individuals, a binary threshold model is purposed in Ref. [326] , where some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e., activist), the remaining individuals however have a high adoption threshold (i.e., bigot). A hierarchical adopting phenomenon is observed, where the activists first adopt the behavior and then stimulate bigots to adopt the behavior. Besides, the model also shows the crossover phenomena in phase transition. Wang et al. [322] also explored individuals' heterogeneous credibilities in social contagion. Zhu et al. [327, 328] studied the local trend imitation within social contagion model, where both the tent-like adoption and the gate-like adoption probabilities are analyzed. Therein, the tentlike adoption means that the adoption probability is an increasing function of x (i.e., the fraction of adopted neighbors) when x is smaller than a certain value, and it becomes a decreasing function when x is larger than this certain value. The gate-like adoption, however, means that the behavior adoption probability is equal to 1 when x is in a range, while it equal to 0 when x is out of this range. For the tent-like case, they showed that the local trend imitation capacity impacts the phase transition, where a second-order phase transition is observed when the capacity is strong, while it becomes a first-order phase transition when the capacity is weak [327] . An optimal imitation capacity is found to maximize the final adoption size in the gate-like case [328] . Su et al. [329] proposed a susceptibletrial-adopted-susceptible (STAS) threshold model, where individuals in trial state are accepting behavior temporarily and can transmit the information. They found that the initial conditions of the dynamics affect the final state of the dynamics, which arises the hysteresis loop in the system. Wang et al. [330] considered that individuals communicate with multiple channels. When an individual is active in one layer, he/she can not use other channels to communicate since individuals cannot simultaneously use all communication channels. Time-delays occur and slow down the behavior adoption process, however it doesn't affect the final adoption size. Wang et al. [331] purposed a model, where time-delays are introduced before an individual to adopt a behavior when his/her fraction of adopted neighbors is equal to or exceeds the adoption threshold. They found the long time-delays induce a microtransition and it becomes sharper when the high-degree individuals have a larger probability experiencing time-delays.",

As shown in Fig. 12 , the epidemic threshold \u03b1 is a nonincreasing function of \u03b2 for both rsynergy and d-synergy. P\u00e9rez-Reche et al. also showed that the constructive synergy induces an exploitative behavior resulting in a rapid spreading process and the interfering synergy causes a slower and sparser exploitative foraging strategy that traverses larger distances by infecting fewer hosts. Within this framework, Taraskin and P\u00e9rez-Reche [336] found increasing the connectivity of a lattice will enhance the synergistic effects on spreading. Broder-Rodgers et al. [337] investigated the effects of both the r-synergistic mechanism and the network topology (by rewiring edges in the regular lattices) on the epidemic threshold of the SIR model. They found the network topology markedly impacts the spread. Under the strong constructive synergy, the systems becomes more resilient to the spread of the epidemic after more rewirings. However, rewiring always enhances the spread of epidemics when the synergy is destructive or weakly constructive if the local connectivity is low. G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es et al.

One interesting finding is that the synergistic interactions can greatly enhance the spreading of the behaviors in both layers. They also found the synergy effects alter the nature of the phase transition of the behavior adoption processes, in which a small (large) value of the transmission rate of behavior 1 (with small adoption threshold) can lead to a discontinuous (continuous) phase transition in behavior 2 (with large adoption threshold). Besides, with the synergy effects, a two-stage spreading phenomenon is observed that nodes adopting the small threshold behavior in one layer are more likely to adopt the large threshold behavior and further stimulate the remaining nodes to quickly adopt the behavior in the other layer. Chang and Fu [345] proposed a co-diffusion model for social contagion on a two-layer network which are respectively a periodic lattice and a random regular network. The model considers two aspects of the diffusion process. One is the inclusive adoption which allows individuals to adopt two behaviors (i.e., synergy adoption). At first, each naive individual (without adoption of any behaviors) becomes active with probability",

When an individual is considering adoption, if a neighbor is dormant then this neighbor's influence is discounted. Chang and Fu found that lower synergy makes contagions more susceptible to global cascade, especially for those diffusing on lattices. Faster diffusion of one contagion with dormancy may block the diffusion of the other. Czaplicka et al. [346] explored the competition of the simple (SIS model) and the complex adoption processes (Watts threshold model) on interdependent networks. The interdependent networks consist of a simple adoption layer and a complex adoption layer, respectively corresponding to the layers which the SIS spreading process and the Watts threshold adoption process occur on. The interconnections between these two layers are added to couple the adoption processes. Czaplicka et al. found the transition points and the nature of transitions for both single dynamical processes are affected by the coupled dynamics. Specifically, the continuous transition can be observed in the complex adoption layer and the discontinuous transition occurs in the simple adoption layer, while in the previous studies [41] the SIS model and the Watts threshold model respectively exhibit continuous transition and discontinuous transition. Srivastava et al. [347] investigated two competing cascades modeled by a generalized threshold model on a signed network, with trust and distrust edges. They developed a pairwise analytical method to approximately calculate the probability of a node being infected at any given time. Srivastava et al. took the advantage of the derived solution to develop a heuristic method for the influence maximization problem, and showed that their proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, particular when the network is dominated by distrust relationships.",

Such that, with the wide adoptions of social media and other socio-technical systems, the abundance of information to which we are exposed is exceeding our limited capacity [349, 350] . The information or ideas in different social medias must compete for our limited attention to become popular. To under the role of limited attention of individual users in the diffusion of memes, Weng et al. [348] developed an agent-based model and investigated how they shape the spread of information (see Fig. 16 for the illustration of the meme diffusion model). By turning the length of the time window in which posts are retained in an agent's screen or memory, they can change the extent of competition. For example, a shorter time window leads to less attention and thus enhances competition, while a longer time window allows for attention to more memes being noticed and thus decreases competition. By modeling the meme spreading on real social networks and random networks, they found the combination of social network structure and the competition for finite user attention is a sufficient condition for the emergence of broad diversity in meme popularity, lifetime and user activity. Glesson et al. [351] presented an analytically solvable model of selection behavior on a social network. They assumed each screen has capacity for only one meme, corresponding to the fierce competition. During each time step (with time increment \u2206t = 1/N), one node i is chosen at random. Then node i innovates with probability \u00b5 and generates a brand-new meme, that appears on its screen and is retweeted to all i's followers. Otherwise, node i retweets the meme currently on its screen. When a meme is retweeted, its popularity is incremented by 1 and the meme currently on the followers' screens are overwritten by this meme. They found the competition among multiple memes for the limited user attention poises the system at criticality. For the network of degree distribution P (k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 D , with 2 < \u03b3 D < 3, they derived the distribution of popularities at age a by q n (a) (i.e., a meme has been retweeted n times when its age is a) when a \u2192 \u221e as",

(45), they showed that the popularity growth of each meme is described by a critical branching process, and the asymptotic analysis predicts power-law distributions of popularities with very heavy tails in the zero-innovation limit (\u00b5 = 0). Glesson et al. [352] further extended the above simplified model with the inclusion of memory times and the heterogenous user activity rates. Even this generalized model is more complicated, they showed that it is analytically solvable and is able to reproduce several important characteristics of empirical micro-blogging data on hashtag usage, such as the time-dependent heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity. In modelling the collective behavior of users' decisions on adopting different software applications, Glesson et al. [353] put forward a model which incorporates two distinct mechanisms: one is associated with recent decisions of users and the other reflects the cumulative popularity of each application. They found various combinations of the two mechanisms that can yield the long-time behavior matched with the data. However, only the models that strongly emphasize the recent popularity of applications over their cumulative popularity can reproduce the observed temporal dynamics. Myers et al. [354] studied URL diffusion in Twitter and proposed a statistical model that allows for cooperation as well as competition of different contagions in the diffusion of retweeting behaviors. The competing contagions decrease the transmission rate of each other, while cooperating contagions help each other. By evaluating the model on the 18,000 contagions which are simultaneously spreading through the Twitter network, Myers et al. estimated the probability of a user being infected given a sequence or previously observed contagions, and also found that the interactions between simultaneous contagions will cause a relative change in the spreading probability of a contagion by 71% on the average. Valera et al. [355] used continuous-time Hawkes processes to model the adoption of multiple products and conventions. An inference method was developed to estimate the parameters for both the synthetic and real data. They found this data-driven model predicts the adoption and the usage pattern of competing products and social conventions well. Meanwhile, the model reveals that the usage of more popular products and conventions is triggered by cooperation and using a less popular product or convention has a stronger inhibiting effect on future uses of a more popular product or convention than vice versa. Pathak et al. [356] proposed a generalized version of the linear threshold model to simulate multiple cascades on a network. In the model, nodes are allowed to switch their states back and forth. An algorithm is developed to estimate the most likely stats of the cascades' spread and shown to be with high quality tested in real data.",

Once the healthy individuals obtain the information about the epidemic, they will be aware of the epidemic and thus take some actions (e.g., wearing face masks or staying at home) to protect themselves from being infected by the disease, which will effectively suppress the outbreak of the infectious disease. To understand how awareness spreading (also called information spreading in the literature) can mitigate disease outbreaks, and more broadly, the interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics has led to a novel research domain in network science [52] . When investigating the coevolution of awareness diffusion and epidemic spreading dynamics, scientists always assume that the susceptible individuals will take some non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs, e.g., hand-washing and social distancing) once they are aware of that they are in a dangerous circumstances, and thus the susceptible nodes will have smaller probability of being infected by their neighbors [357, 358, 359, 360] . Usually, the disease outbreak threshold increases and the infected size decreases when the interventions are implemented. Vaccination is another effective measure to suppress the spreading of infectious diseases [361, 362, 363] . In most cases, the effects of vaccination and NPIs on the epidemic spreading are investigated separately [364] . Andrews and Bauch [365] proposed a model which includes both the two measures, and revealed that the practice of NPIs decreases if vaccine coverage increases, and vice versa. In what follows, we discuss the recent progresses about the coevolution of awareness and epidemic on single and multiplex networks.",

In their proposed model, the information about disease is called as awareness. An individual i with awareness level \u2113 i represents that the awareness has undergone \u2113 i individuals before arriving at i, \u2113 i = 0 means that individual i has the first-hand awareness. The awareness level of individual i is updated according to the following three rules. (i) A new awareness \u2113 i = 0 is generated with probability \u03c9 if individual i is in the infected state. (ii) If individual j transmits a newer piece of awareness with level \u2113 j to his/her neighbor individual i with rate \u03b1, updating \u2113 i \u2190 \u2113 j + 1 when \u2113 j < \u2113 i . (iii) At each time step, the awareness level \u2113 i of node i fades to \u2113 i +1 with probability \u01eb. For a susceptible node with awareness level \u2113, its susceptibility is 1 \u2212 h \u2113 , where 0 < h < 1. That is to say, the older the awareness (i.e., the higher level) is, the weaker the protection power is. With the considering of awareness, the SIR epidemic evolves as follows. An infected node transmits the infection to a susceptible neighbor of awareness level \u2113 with probability (1\u2212h \u2113 )\u03b2, and recovers with probability \u03b3. By using a mean-field approach, the authors revealed that the outbreak threshold is not changed in well-mixed population, while the epidemic size is much lower than the one without awareness. However, the epidemic outbreak threshold increases on highly structured networks, such as lattices. As shown in Fig. 18 , in the snapshot, the infected nodes are surrounded by the cloud of awareness, which greatly suppresses the epidemic spread.",

Another line about the awareness-epidemic spreading dynamics assumed that the awareness is correlated with neighbors, such as, the number of infected neighbors [357, 358, 359, 360, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395] . The nodes which are aware of the epidemic will decrease their infectivity probability [357, 396] or activity [397] . In this case, the evolution of awareness is directly determined by the evolution of epidemic. Thus, we only need to write down the evolution equations of the epidemic. Zhang et al. [359] proposed an awareness-epidemic model, in which the awareness of a susceptible node is determined by the number of its infected neighbors. In this model, a susceptible node with awareness has smaller infectivity probability, i.e., the infection probability is \u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03b1 r ) n I , where \u03bb is the basic infection probability, \u03b1 r is the reduction factor, and n I is the number of infected neighbors.

Granell et al. revealed that the first assumption almost has no effect on the epidemic spreading, while the second assumption and mass media indeed alter the phase diagram. For instance, the metacritical point will disappear if mass media is strong enough.

When an epidemic outbreaks, the information about the epidemic can spread on various channels such as Twitter, Facebook and short-message through mobile phones. However, the susceptible nodes may not arise the awareness immediately when they only receive one piece of information from neighbors [4] . Thus the awareness spreading exhibits social reinforcement or herd-like feature [408] . Guo et al. proposed a local awareness controlled contagion spreading (LACS) model to describe the coevolution of awareness and epidemic on multiplex networks [409] . The Watts threshold model [249] is used to describe the awareness spreading, in which an unaware node becomes aware if (1) the fraction of its aware neighbors excesses a given threshold \u03c6, or (2) it is infected by the epidemic. The aware node returns unaware when it is susceptible or relaxes its vigilance. For the epidemic spreading dynamics, they adopted the model proposed in Ref. [403] with a complete immunization, i.e., \u03bb \u2032 2 = 0. Using a generalized MMCA approach, Guo et al. obtained highly accurate of the epidemic threshold. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, the epidemic threshold \u03bb 2 c versus \u03c6 exhibits abrupt decrease at \u03c6 c \u2248 0.5. For the case of \u03c6 < \u03c6 c , the epidemic size and outbreak threshold nearly do not change with \u03c6. When \u03c6 > \u03c6 c , the epidemic do not vary with \u03c6, but the epidemic size increases with \u03c6. Huang et al. [410] investigated the coupled contagion of the awareness and the epidemic, where the former is depicted by the unaware-aware-unaware (UAU) model on the aware layer and the latter is elaborated by the threshold model (susceptible-infected) on the contact layer. The interacting mechanisms are introduced that an unaware individual immediately changes to aware state if it is infected in the contact layer. An susceptible individual can be infected by each of its infected neighbors with a certain probability if it is in unaware state. While for an aware and susceptible individual, only when the number of its infected neighbors is equal to or exceeds a threshold, it is infected by the epidemic. Huang et al. found such heterogenous interactions can induce the hybrid phase transitions which includes the coexistence of continuous phase transition and bi-stable states.",

Pan and Yan [413] proposed a coevolution model of awareness and epidemic, in which the awareness of nodes comes from three types of information: contact information, local and global prevalence of the epidemic. The epidemic threshold increases with the contact-based information, but does not change with the information about the local and global prevalence of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effects of the heterogeneities of individuals' responses, structures of virtual and contact networks are investigated, and the existence of two-stage effects on the epidemic threshold are demonstrated [413] . Zang considered the awareness transmission probability equals to the fraction of nodes in the aware state, and found that the epidemic spreading is greatly suppressed [414] .",

Thus, the network topology can be treated as static networks. However, abundant experimental studies indicated that the network topology is varying during the spreading process [30, 201] . Guo et al. [420] assumed that the virtual network varies faster than the awareness spreading, and the contact network varies slower than the epidemic spreading. Therefore, the activity-driven network [202] is used to describe the virtual network, and the contact network is still assumed to be static. Then the awareness spreads on this temporal network according to the UAU model as proposed in Ref. [403] . The epidemic spreading dynamics on contact network evolves as the model in Ref. [202] . Through a generalized MMCA approach, Guo et al. found that the metacritical point is bounded by [0, 1/(m( a + a 2 )) \u00d7 [0, 1/\u039b max (B)], where a and a 2 are the first and second moments of activity potential distribution. If the awareness spreading dynamics follows a threshold model, the epidemic threshold versus \u03c6 exhibits a sharp decrease at \u03c6 \u2248 0.5, which is similar to the results in Ref. [409] .

For the awareness spreading dynamics, they used an SIRlike model. Specifically, each aware (or infected) node transmits the awareness to unaware (i.e., susceptible) neighbors with probability \u03bb 1 , and recovers with probability \u03b3 1 = 1. The unaware node will be aware about the epidemic when its counterpart in the contact network is infected by the epidemic. For the epidemic spreading dynamics, a susceptible-infected-recovered-vaccination (SIRV) model is adopted. The infected nodes will transmit the infection to susceptible neighbors with probability \u03bb 2 , and recovers with probability \u03b3 2 = 1. A susceptible node i B in layer B will become vaccination if its counterpart in layer A becomes aware. To quantificationally describe the coevolution spreading dynamics, Wang et al. developed a generalized heterogeneous mean-field theory. The rate equations of the awareness spreading are",

In simulations, the communication network is generated by using the scale-free (SF) uncorrelated configuration model [422] , and the contact network is ER network. This coupled network is thus called as SF-ER networks (i.e., the communication network is scale-free and the contact network is an ER network) hereinafter. As shown in Fig. 24 , the theoretical predictions agree well with simulations. One can observe that the final awareness outbreak size R A increases with \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 , while the final epidemic outbreak size R B decreases with \u03bb 1 . Juher and Salda\u00f1a investigated the effects of overlap of two layers on the coevolution of awareness and epidemic [423] , and found the epidemic outbreak threshold is dependent on the fraction of overlap edges between two layers. In reality, immunization is always expensive and risky [424, 97] . For rational individuals, they will verify the necessity before adopting immunization. Along this line, Wang et al. [369] generalized the model proposed in Ref. [421] and assumed that a susceptible node adopting immunization should consider two aspects: (i) whether its counterpart in the communication network is aware of the epidemic, and (ii) whether the number of its infected neighbors in the contact network is larger than a threshold \u03c6. Using the heterogeneous mean-field theory, Wang et al. showed that the awareness outbreak threshold is identical to that in Eq. (66) . However, the epidemic outbreak threshold is the same with that there is no awareness spreading on the communication networks when \u03c6 \u2265 1. While if \u03c6 = 0, the epidemic threshold is identical to that in Eq. (67) . Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analysis on different types of artificial multiplex networks, Wang et al. found that there is an optimal awareness transmission probability \u03bb o 1 at which the epidemic will be greatly suppressed, as shown in Fig.  25 .",

The possibility of eradicating epidemics, as well as the welfare loss induced by epidemics are highlighted. In the area of public health, there are some outstanding studies about the government resource input in coping with the epidemic spreading [427] . It is found that sharing the resource of antiviral drugs among the countries helps to contain the epidemic outbreak at the global level, and the more cooperative the resources, the more effective are the containments in all regions of the world. It has been pointed out that the lack of resource allocation can arouse critical financial crisis. For example, the scarcity of a resource is closely related to the susceptibility of the trade network with respect to cascading shocks [428] .

The resource regulation effects from both government policy and market were discussed. In a more realistic scene, the resource allocation is performed on spatial districts. For example, the epidemic outbreaks may occur in different but interconnected regions. Under this setting, Mbah et al. [431] studied an optimal control model to minimize the discounted number of infected individuals during the course of an epidemic with economic constraints, and investigated the preferential treatment strategies. Their results indicated that when facing with the dilemma of choosing between socially equitable and purely efficient strategies, the optimal control strategy is not apparent but should be determined by many epidemiological factors such as the basic reproductive number,the efficiency of the treatment measure, etc. Apart from multiple populations from different regions, the resource allocation over multiple time periods are studied [432, 433] . Mbah et al. suggested that allowing for some reallocation of resources or funds over the time horizon, rather than allocating resources just once at the beginning of the time horizon, can lead to significant increases in health benefits.",

Preciado et al. [434] proposed a model, where the infections rate of each individual can be reduced by distributing the vaccination resources to them (so that they become less infective). Considering the cost of the corresponding vaccination, a convex framework to find the optimal distribution of vaccinations to contain the epidemics in arbitrary contact networks is proposed. In a similar model with the mechanism that the resources can be used to reduce individual infection rates or/and to increase the recovery rates, Enyioha et al. [435] proposed a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to solve this problem, and got a distributed solution in which agents in the network were able to locally compute their optimal allocations. In a more realistic case, the curing rate of each node is positively correlated to its medical resources, that is, the more resources given, the higher curing rate. Since the total amount of medical resources is limited, the average curing rate is thus fixed. By using the mean-field theory and Lagrange multiplier method, Chen et al. [436] analyzed how to best allocate the limited resources to each node so as to minimize the epidemic prevalence. On temporal networks, Nowzari et al. [437] assumed that the epidemic spreading can be suppressed by decreasing the strength or weight of edges when allocating the resources. This can be understood that, for example, the government might be able to decrease the edge weight by reducing interactions between two nodes, such as limiting the amount of transportation between two cities. Nowzari et al. further showed that this problem can be formulated as a geometric program and solved in polynomial time.",

It is found that the inter-layer connecting strength can lead to the phase transition from the discontinuous phase to the continuous one or vice versa, whereas the internal connecting strength can result in the hybrid phase transition apart from discontinuous and continuous ones. Thus, the links between the layers and the links within a layer play different roles in the resourceinduced critical phenomena. Since epidemic spreading naturally involves time delay due to the order of propagation, the effects of time-delays between the layers are discussed [442] . Interestingly, it is found that the time delay can induce discontinuous, continuous and hybrid phase transitions among them, depending on the resource amount, the connecting strength between layers and their internal structures. In addition, there is a critical threshold of time delay such that even a small resource amount can effectively control the epidemic spreading if the delay is beyond this threshold, otherwise a huge amount of resource is needed.

They considered the cases that nodes with large degree tends to receive more (or less) resource. Through analysis and numerical simulations, they find that the virus spreading can be optimally suppressed if there is no such a relation between the node degrees and resource amounts they received. Under this optimal strategy, there will be a maximum outbreak threshold and minimum fraction of infected nodes. Moreover, they find that the uneven distribution of resource would lead to discontinuous phase transition in homogeneous network while heterogeneous networks always go through continuous transitions.",

In the view of global (government) resources, the outbreak of epidemic will reduce the labor force as sick workers will lose their productivity, and thus decrease the resource output. In the view of individual resources, social individuals may distribute their resources to their sick friends. In all these cases, the amount of resources should be affected by the epidemic process. In a word, the evolution of epidemic spreading is affected by the amount of resources, and at the same time, the amount of resources is also influenced by the epidemic spreading. Unlike the case under constant resources, the dynamical evolution of resources can bring nontrivial effects on the spreading of epidemic. The researches on the epidemic-resource coevolution processes come to the fore only recently. In this coevolution process, the critical outbreak of epidemic epidemic depends on the evolution properties of epidemics, resources and the complex interplay among them as well as the network topology.",

In the budget-constrained SIS (bSIS) model [446] , the healthy individuals produce the resources while the infected individuals consumes resources to recover. Insufficient resources producing rate would induce the outbreak of the epidemic. Equivalently, epidemic spread out explosively if the cost of recovery is above a critical value. Surprisingly, this can occur even when the epidemic would die out without the resource constraint. The onset of explosive epidemics exhibits a discontinuous phase transition. In more details, as illustrated in Fig. 29 , the budget-constrained SIS model modifies the classical SIS dynamic by introducing a global budget b that can be increased by the number of healthy individuals per time step. There is a basic recovery process that is independent of the available budget, occurring at a rate \u03b3 0 . Furthermore, each individual can recover through treatment and this requires a cost c. This resourcemediated recovery requires the budget. On the other hand, the rate of recovery through treatment is \u03b3 b f (b), where f (b) is a function of the budget, satisfying Figure 29 : Illustration of the bSIS model. Reproduced from Ref.

Assume that each individual can choose to use the resource to vaccinate or otherwise not to vaccinate. Without vaccination, there is a possibility that they become infected and this would also result in cost to treat the epidemic. In this situation, the evolution of resource is reflected in the evolution of the strategy about how individual use the resource. The human behavior and the networkingconstrained interactions among individuals significantly impact the coevolution of the epidemic and the resource strategy. Zhang et al. [447] proposed a theoretical framework to study the coevolution of epidemic and the resources game. Taking into account the periodic outbreaks of flu-like epidemics and the limited effectiveness of vaccines, they studied models with seasonal updating and pre-emptive vaccination, in which individuals decide whether or not to get vaccinated before each epidemic season. The strategy for individuals is whether they vaccinate or not. Although it requires a cost to vaccinate, individuals also cost money to treat the epidemic if they are infected when they do not receive vaccination. Once the epidemic ends, individuals update their vaccination decisions for the next season by imitating the strategy of neighbors. The neighbor with higher payoff has higher probability to be learned, which is described by the famous the Fermi rule in game theory [448] .",

Under the partial-subsidy policy, the vaccination coverage depends monotonically on the sensitivity of individuals to payoff difference, but the dependence is nonmonotonous for the free-subsidy policy, referring to Figs. 31(c) and 31(d). Due to the role models of the donees for relatively irrational individuals and the unchanged strategies of the donees for rational individuals, the free-subsidy policy can in general lead to higher vaccination coverage, referring to Figs. 31(a)-(b). As speculated, for the free-subsidy case , the freely vaccinated donees (red points as shown in Fig.31(b) ) are randomly distributed in the square lattice and surrounded by many imitated vaccinators, forming vaccination clusters and leading to relatively large vaccination coverage as compared with the partial-subsidy case (see Fig.31 (a) ).",

[449] already claimed that, the performance of the partial-subsidy policy is significantly better than that of the freesubsidy policy, because the partial-offset subsidy policy encourages more people to take vaccination. In the partial-subsidy scenario, with limited amount of total subsidy, a moderate subsidy rate for each vaccinated individual can guarantee the group-optimal vaccination, leading to the maximal social benefits, while such an optimal phenomenon is not evident for the free subsidy scenario. Regarding the cost in vaccination, Zhang et al. [450] further proposed a model where individuals are freely vaccinated according to either the targeted or random subsidy policy in advance, while the remaining individuals choose to vaccinate or not based on voluntary principle and update their vaccination decision via an imitation rule. Here, targeted subsidy policy means a fraction of nodes with highest degrees are freely vaccinated while random subsidy policy means that the freely vaccinated nodes are chosen randomly. It is found that the targeted subsidy policy is only advantageous when individuals prefer to imitate the subsidized individuals' strategy. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the targeted policy is worse than that of the random subsidy policy, since individuals preferentially select non-subsidized individuals as their potential imitation objects. More importantly, under the targeted subsidy policy, preferential imitation causes a nontrivial phenomenon that the final epidemic size increases with the increase of the proportion of subsidized individuals. In summary, epidemic-control policy through resource input depends on the complex interplay among the intrinsic mathematical rules of epidemic spreading, governmental policies, and behavioral responses of individuals. Moreover, this complexity may arise the so-called Braess's Paradox [364] such that increasing the strategy performance may in contrary lead to worse strategy outcomes (more resource to be consumed).",

The hybrid phase transition in the steady infection size \u03c1 is observed, exhibiting properties of both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions.

Therefore, there are three possible system states: (i) completely healthy, (ii) partially infected, and (iii) completely infected. This is different from the classical SIS model where there are only two possible final infected states. In addition, there are hysteresis loops in the phase transition.

If it is initially high, e.g., \u03c1(0) = 0.9, the epidemic breaks out at the persistence threshold \u03b2 per .",

When the strength of inter-layer correlation is below a critical value, increasing \u03b1 p changes the phase transition from double continuous to single continuous. When the strength of inter-layer correlation is above a critical value, the phase transition first changes from multiple continuous to discontinuous and then to hybrid. There are hysteresis loops in the phase transition. Moreover, there is an optimal strategy at any given strength of inter-layer correlation where the threshold reaches a maximum and under which the epidemic can be maximally suppressed. In addition, the optimal controlling parameter \u03b1 p increases as the strength of inter-layer correlation increases. Chen et al. [455] further considered a similar model with preferential resource diffusion where the resource received is proportional to the number of healthy neighbours. They found two distinct preferential effects. When the transmission rate is small, the resources of the healthy nodes should be allocated preferentially to the highly infectious nodes (nodes with more infected neighbors) to constrain the epidemic spreading. When the transmission rate is large, the resource allocation should be determined by the stage of epidemic spreading. Namely, in the early stage of the epidemic spreading, resources should be allocated preferentially to the highly infectious nodes similar to the case of small transmission rate while after the early stage, resources should be allocated to the less infectious nodes. With the individual resource diffusion framework, they further proposed a resource allocation strategy that can adaptively change with the current fraction of infected nodes and the epidemic can be maximally suppressed under the proposed strategy, which gives a novel viewpoint to the optimal epidemic control problem under resource constraint.",

Interestingly, in the case that the system includes dissipation, it asymptotically realizes a dynamical phase characterized by an organized scale-free network, in which the ranking of each node with respect to the quantity of the resource possessed thereby changes ceaselessly.

The landscape of the studies on coveolution spreading dynamics are presented in Fig. 6 . The two main classes of spreading dynamics are biology and social contagions, and the two types of coevolution spreading processes related to the controlling strategies are epidemicawareness spreading and epidemic-resource spreading. As in the early stage of the progresses of evolution spreading studies, many efforts are made in analyzing various factors that are known to play significant roles in the single spreading dynamics. In addition, most theoretical approaches introduced in this review are firstly developed to analyze the single spreading dynamics. This situation will last for years and then completely novel viewpoints and approaches may arise. In the so-called big data era, the increasingly available empirical data in social platforms (such as Twitter and Facebook) and biological systems makes us able to build some more realistic data-driven coevolution spreading models [39, 457] . For the existing works, most of the known interacting mechanisms between two spreading, such as synergy, competing and asymmetrical, have not been verified by empirical data. Whether those coevolving mechanisms are enough to capture main properties of real dynamics, or we still need more intricate interacting models are not yet clear to us. Therefore, we should first collect as more as possible related data. For example, to crawl the forwarding time series, the network topology and the personal information about new and products, and then to analyze the interacting mechanisms between those news and products. In a word, to reveal the representative features of real coevolution spreading processes from empirical data (or, more valuably but more difficultly, from designed experiments) is the most significant task before credible studies on mathematical models.",

The resilience of a system is the ability to maintain its functions when some errors and attacks occur, or some environmental and dynamical parameters are changed [482, 483, 484, 485, 486] . Previous studies mainly focused on the resilience of single dynamics, such as epidemic spreading [487, 488] , biological dynamics [489, 490] , climate changes [491, 492, 493] and financial dynamics [494, 495] . Pananos et al. [496] studied the critical dynamics in population with vaccinating behavior by extracting data on measles-related tweets and Google searches. They revealed the critical slowing down and critical speeding up for coevolution dynamics, which is markedly different from single spreading. Since the resilience depends on the dynamical process, does there exist some common characteristics for the resilience of coevolution spreading dynamics? For a given coevolution spreading process, how to estimate its resilience?",

For single spreading dynamics, some effective measures (e.g., H-index [497] and k-core [498] ) and algorithms (e.g., PageRank [499] , LeaderRank [500] , collective influence [89] and some heuristic algorithms [501] ) are proposed. More detailed progresses about vital nodes identification are presented in a recent review [45] . We should note that an effective vital node identification algorithm may not work for coevolution spreading dynamics. For instance, the nodes with high k-shell values are more likely to be the influential nodes, however, those nodes may inhibit the spreading when there exists asymmetrical interactions between two dynamics. Therefore, the vital node identification problem should be redefined and reanalyzed for the coevolution spreading dynamics.",
