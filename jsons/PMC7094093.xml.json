A prominent method in use today is the multiple sequence alignment method. However, while this method is widely recognized as an accurate means of grouping genomes, it is extremely time consuming and can take up to several days or more depending on the amount of data being examined. In this project, we seek to find an alternative method to cluster genomes that does not require vast computational power.",

Consequently, when comparing genomes based on multiple moments, the higher moments hold much greater weight due to their magnitude. To compensate for this, we use various normalization factors. In the above M\u02dcj definition, N is the denominator, but it can be altered to vary with the order of the moment as well. This can be done as follows:(3)Mj=1Nj\u2211k=0N\u22121(PS(k))j,j=1,2,\u2026.Additionally, N is the length of the whole sequence, but we split the sequence into four separate vectors for the four nucleotides. As a result, each nucleotide has its own associated sequence length, or the number of that specific nucleotide. These values will be known as NA,NC,NG, and N\nT. Because the whole genome consists of nucleotides A, C, G, and T, they can also be incorporated into the equations to normalize the moments to make higher moments at similar values to the lower moments. This is important at later steps when we are comparing the genomes. The new lengths can be incorporated into the normalization in the following equation:(4)MjA=1NAj\u22121Nj\u22121\u2211k=0N\u22121(PS(k))j.Moreover, instead of only analyzing (PS(k))j, central moments can be calculated by instead analyzing the value of the difference between the power spectrum value at a point k and the mean of all values of the power spectrum. In other words, we would do the following to calculate central moments with a normalizing factor of just (1/N): Mean=1N\u2211k=0N\u22121PS(k),\n(5)CMj=1N\u2211k=0N\u22121(PS(k)\u2212Mean)j.Just as we altered the normalizing factors with the regular moments, we can do the same for the central moments to get several other equations as shown below:(6)CMjA=1NAj\u22121Nj\u22121\u2211k=0N\u22121(PS(k)\u2212Mean)j.\n",

To do this, several moments of each genome are computed, which is done in C++, and we built the phylogenetic trees using the function hclust in R (R Development Core Team, 2008), where the complete linkage clustering algorithm is used. Specifically, we calculate the first few regular and central moments of the genome for each nucleotide and assign that genome a point in Euclidean space with those moments as the coordinates. Then, a distance matrix can be generated from the pairwise distances of the genomes using Euclidean distance. A distance matrix can then be used in clustering algorithms to separate genomes into various clusters or groups. Here, we have used the complete linkage clustering algorithm and the average linkage clustering algorithm. In complete linkage clustering, the distance between two clusters is computed as the distance between the farthest two elements in the two clusters (Dawyndt et al., 2005). On the other hand, the distance between two clusters in average linkage clustering is defined as the average pairwise distance between the points of two clusters. The clustering algorithms then create a phylogenetic tree to show how the genomes are grouped together.",

This is because as the number of moments increases, the clustering results will quickly stabilize due to the fact that the magnitude of the higher moments quickly drops close to 0, rendering their effect negligible. We take 20 moments here: the first three regular moments, and the second and third central moments for each of four nucleotides. This gives each nucleotide five moments, resulting in a 20-dimensional point in Euclidean space. The same combination gives good results for all the examples in the present paper (coronavirus, human rhinovirus, and bacteria), although fewer moments may be needed for the (smaller) coronavirus genomes to achieve the same results.",

To cluster various genomes, we experimented with various combinations of types of moment, normalization factor, and clustering methods. Accurate results came from a combination of the use of regular moments and the use of central moments of all four nucleotides. The normalizing factor used was 1/(Nj\u22121Nmj\u22121) with m being the nucleotide of that particular moment. The first three regular moments of each nucleotide were calculated with Eq. (4). Afterwards, the second and third central moments were calculated with Eq. (6). This gives each nucleotide five moments, resulting in a 20-dimensional point in Euclidean space. An Euclidean pairwise distance matrix is then calculated to use with clustering algorithms (Dawyndt et al., 2005) in the statistical program R.",

Although average linkage clustering provided a higher cophenetic coefficient than complete linkage clustering, complete linkage clustering provided superior results. This is because cophenetic analysis is not a definitive method to select the best clustering method. In the case of genome clustering, we see that complete linkage clustering is able to provide better results in spite of its lower cophenetic coefficients.
