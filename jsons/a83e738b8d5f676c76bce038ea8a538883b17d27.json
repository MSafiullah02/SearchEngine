Echocardiography revealed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction without valve impairment. A right heart strain or pericardial effusion was excluded. The patient then underwent urgent coronary angiography. Norepinephrine 1.8 \u00b5g kg \u22121 min \u22121 was sufficient to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of 60 mmHg. The coronary angiography (Fig. 3) After successful recanalization utilizing balloon dilation followed by stenting with a 3.0/28 mm and a 2.5/15 mm drug eluting stent (Zotarolimus/ABT-578), TIMI III flow was documented. Antiplatelet therapy with tirofiban and prasugrel was commenced and the loading dose applied immediately. The dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and prasugrel was administered via an orogastric tube. On ICU, a hemodynamic measurement system (PiCCO \u00ae , Pulsion Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany) was established to An episode of atrial fibrillation with a short hemodynamic worsening was treated successfully by electric cardioversion and cardiac rhythm was stabilised with amiodarone administration. After levosimendan was given, a short rise of CPI up to 0.43 on day 6 occurred. In summary, hemodynamic measurement revealed a mixed form of septic and cardiac shock due to septic and ischemic cardiomyopathy. On day 5 cyanosis of the extremities appeared and became more noticeable in subsequent days. Surprisingly, this was not associated with a significant increase of serum lactate levels, which remained between 1.0 and 2.5 mmol/l throughout the whole course of his admission to ICU. An association with norepinephrine use remained difficult to establish regarding doses mostly around 0.4 \u00b5g kg \u22121 min \u22121 culminating in day 2 at values around 0.7 \u00b5g kg \u22121 min \u22121 , which were significantly reduced after levosimendan administration. No evidence was obtained for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). On day 5, a continuous decrease of renal activity (creatinine 3.95 mg/dl, eGFR 16.4 ml/m/1.73 m 2 ) and oliguria of less than 20 ml / hour resulted in commencement of veno-venous hemodiafiltration with citrate (CVVHD-Ci-Ca). An acute renal failure occurred in association with a bacterial superinfection implied by rising procalcitonin levels (0.96 ng/ml) in the general context of a rapidly progressing multi organ failure. The patient was given antibiotic therapy with azithromycin (500 mg/day) and piperacillin/tazobactam (4.0 g + 0.5 g; four doses per day). The patient was sedated and ventilated (pressure-controlled ventilation, BIPAP-mode). The oxygenation index indicated a severe ARDS in line with the Berlin Definition of ARDS. In the subsequent days the oxygenation improved slightly. In addition to the respiratory aspect a prolonged reduction of cardiac power in spite of levosimendan therapy and a low systemic vascular resistance made the hemodynamic situation unfavourable for use of a VA-ECMO. Nevertheless, hypoxemia remained the major problem, even in the context of an escalated ventilation with worsening oxygenation. On day 11 after admission to our hospital and on day 8 after admission to ICU, it was agreed that there should be no further escalation in treatment and only supportive care should be offered. The patient died later due to multi organ failure.",

Insufficient data exist regarding the extent to which coronary artery disease contributes to morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients. Shaobo et al. [1] recently reported an association between COVID-19 infection and cardiac injury, resulting in a higher risk of in-hospital mortality than with either condition alone. The mechanisms of this observation remain uncertain. Previous research has demonstrated that influenza and other viral diseases precipitate coronary spasm, plaque ruptures or stent thrombosis by tachycardia, hypoxia, increased wall stress, procoagulation or inflammatory cytokine release [2] [3] [4] [5] . Consistently, the term immunothrombosis was coined to describe thrombotic events triggered by inflammatory reactions [6] . A recent publication by Zhang et al. [7] describe the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in COVID-19 patients, which may lead to thrombotic events. In this regard, the necessity of antiplatelet therapy or intensifying an established therapy in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease or a history of stenting, especially recent stenting, remains the goal of further research.",
