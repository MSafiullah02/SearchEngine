Indeed, a hospital outbreak with a large cluster of patients was the defining epidemiological characteristic in the recent outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea [4, 5] . Factors that contributed to the large hospital outbreaks included delay in diagnosis of the index case, overcrowding in emergency departments, movements of patients prior to diagnoses, and suboptimal infection prevention and control [6] . A recent study demonstrated that MERS-CoV could survive for longer than 48 hours at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity, suggesting contact or fomite transmission might occur in healthcare settings [7] .",

In Table 2 of their article, MERS-CoV was isolated from 3 patients ( patients 2, 3, and 4), and the respiratory specimens yielding virus culture (+) were obtained at 22 days ( patient 2), 22 days and 25 days ( patient 3), and 18 days ( patient 4) after symptom onset. In patient 3, MERS-CoV RT-PCR was negative on day 27, just 2 days after virus culture (+). These results are unusual, considering that viral load was >10 7 copies/mL in most respiratory samples that yielded virus isolates and virus isolation was unsuccessful in later stages of the infection [9] .",

In order to prove isolation of \"viable\" virus, further data, such as cytopathic effects in cell culture and electron microscopy of MERS-CoV-infected cells, is needed. Until these data are available, we should be careful to use the term \"viable\" or \"isolate\" of virus.",
