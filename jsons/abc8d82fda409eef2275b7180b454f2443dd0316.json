[2] [3] [4] [5] One report from Milwaukee County, Wisconsin found that Covid-19 cases were largely clustered in predominately African American areas and that this clustering was independent of income. 6 The largest study to date on racial and ethnic disparities in the US conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that black individuals were overrepresented in a national sample of 580 patients hospitalized with Covid-19. 7 Thus, racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of and outcomes from Covid-19 have been deemed an urgent public health research priority. 8 However, most studies investigating racial and ethnic disparities have focused on hospitalized patients or have not characterized which individuals were tested or those who tested positive for Covid-19. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] In addition, it is not yet known whether such disparities are driven, at least in part, by differences in underlying health conditions, smoking and alcohol use, geographic location, or urban versus rural residence -essential information if we are to design effective interventions.",

Presence of conditions was determined by one inpatient or two outpatient diagnoses in the two years prior to baseline, except for cancer which was ever prior to baseline. Diagnoses made in the 7 days prior to baseline were not included.

Key strengths of this study were that it was based on well annotated national electronic health record data from a team with decades of experience using VA data, enabling a rapid and reliable analysis of Covid-19 by race and ethnicity. This analysis utilized patients' records from an entire healthcare system, which made it less prone to collider bias (i.e., non-random selection of individuals into a study) than other Covid-19 studies limited to individuals testing positive and admitted to hospital. 17 Unlike other national healthcare systems, linkage to Covid-19 testing data or outcomes was not required as the integrated nature of VA healthcare provided at over 1200 sites nationally allows all information to be stored in its national Corporate Data Warehouse. We used validated algorithms to accurately extract information on and adjust models for a wide range of clinical, behavioral, and geographic factors with very little missingness in the data. The scale of VA data also allowed us to assess the impact of Covid-19 across separate race/ethnicity groups, which would have masked important differences between black and Hispanic individuals. We continue to monitor numbers for individuals of other minority backgrounds and plan to follow-up these analyses when there are sufficient numbers for analysis.",

Second, while individuals in VA care represent a diversity of backgrounds, women represented a small proportion of individuals in the sample. Thus, we were not powered to assess interactions between sex and race/ethnicity. Third, beyond adjusting for rural/urban and site of testing, we were not able to explore likely causes of the pronounced differential burden of Covid-19 among minority individuals. More detailed information on nursing home residence, socioeconomic status (e.g., type of employment, income, number of individuals in household) were unavailable or not consistently recorded in VA data as in most other electronic health record data sources. Fourth, as is true outside the VA, a small proportion of individuals have been tested (~1%) and rates of testing vary widely by site and within important subgroups. However, while initial testing was limited, by mid-April the VA began testing all individuals admitted to hospital and before any inpatient or outpatient procedures are done for clearance even in those not suspected to have Covid-19. We performed sensitivity analyses to see if associations with testing positive changed over time and found conclusions were broadly similar but with some important distinctions. However, our models for testing positive should not be interpreted as a proxy of likelihood of infection since those with mild symptoms were unlikely to have received testing, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak.",

[30] [31] [32] Testing rates for Covid-19 in the VA were higher among black and Hispanic individuals compared to white individuals. Local reporting from metropolitan areas with large minority populations, including New York City 33 and Chicago, 34 have highlighted the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 in minority communities. We showed that VA facilities in these cities and others around the country that conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests also had the highest proportion of black individuals in care. There was a striking difference in the rate of Covid-19 testing by age across race/ethnicity groups, whereby higher rates of testing were observed for middle-aged, white individuals while testing rates steadily increased with age and was highest among those aged 80 or more years among black and Hispanic individuals. White individuals living in urban residences were more likely to be tested than those living in rural residences while the opposite was true among black and Hispanic individuals. Among all individuals tested, those living in urban residences were more likely to test positive for Covid-19 than those living in rural residences. Finally, women were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 than men, but men were twice as likely to test positive. This association strengthened after adjustment and in conditional analyses but should be considered preliminary given limited numbers of women in this analysis.",
