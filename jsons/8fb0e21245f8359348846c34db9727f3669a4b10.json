Nucleic acids, which are critical components for inheriting genetic information in all species including pathogens, are key structures sensed by the innate immune system. The corresponding receptors for foreign nucleic acids include members of Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, and intracellular DNA sensors. While nucleic acid recognition by these receptors is required for host defense against the pathogen, there is a potential risk to the host of self-nucleic acids recognition, thus precipitating autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. In this review, we discuss the roles of nucleic acid-sensing receptors in guarding against pathogen invasion, discriminating between self and non-self, and contributing to autoimmunity and autoinflammatory diseases.",

            "text": "Invasion of microbe to the host induces a defense response that is initiated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (1, 2) . PRRs recognize conserved structures in pathogens and are largely divided into four types based on structural homology: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). In addition, intracellular DNA sensors are proposed as new types of PRRs. Each PRR induces production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), induce several events including inflammation and homing and activation of adaptive immune cells, including T and B cells. Type I IFNs are composed of more than 10 members: multiple IFNa family members, IFNb, IFNe, and IFNs (3) . Type I IFNs play a central role in antiviral responses by inducing transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The ISGs include more than 1000 genes, although many remain uncharacterized. Some of these genes, such as IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa (ISG15), myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), ribonuclease L (RNaseL), and protein kinase R (PKR), have antiviral effects, as demonstrated in mouse genetic studies (4) . Antiviral states are often achieved by a combination of several ISGs, and each ISG is likely to have a specific target to suppress virus replication and budding. Recent studies have described the function of each ISG, defining its specific target pathogen, such as viperin, samhd1, or members of the gbp family (5) (6) (7) .",

            "text": "TLRs are a family of single membrane-spanning receptors of which there are 10 in human and 12 in mouse (1, 2) . TLRs have conserved homology regions, containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in the extracellular space linked by the transmembrane region to the intracellular Toll \u2044 IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Specific patterns from microbial pathogens are recognized by LRRs, which are predicted to predominantly form a dimer for ligand binding. The TLRs are characterized by an ectodomain for ligand recognition (discussed in the following section), whereas the TIR domain is highly homologous, as demonstrated by structural analysis (9, 10) . Activation of the TLRs by ligand binding conducts a signal from its TIR domain to the adapter protein that contains the TIR domain. The adapter protein acts mainly via two signaling pathways: the TIR domain containing the adapter inducing IFNb (TRIF)-dependent pathway, and the myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88)-dependent pathway. TLR3 depends on TRIF, whereas TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 depend on MyD88 (11, 12) . Both adapter proteins culminate in the activation of transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor of j light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF-jB), IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 for transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, and type I IFNs. Briefly, TRIF recruits TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), TRAF3, TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), receptor interacting protein-1 (RIP-1), and transforming growth factor-b activated kinase 1 (TAK1), whereas MyD88 recruits IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK4, TRAF6, and TAK1. TAK1 induces activation of the canonical inhibitor of NF-jB kinase (IKK) a \u2044 b complex, resulting in NF-jB activation. TRAF3 leads to activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKi to phosphorylate IRF3 (1, 2) . In general, signaling networks are shared among the TLR family members and are utilized by the same signaling proteins. MyD88 forms the helical structure for providing signaling platform with downstream protein. Structural analysis demonstrated that MyD88 forms a well-ordered helix with IRAK2 and IRAK4 through their death domains (13, 14) ( Fig. 1) .",

They induce robust production of type I IFNs when activated by TLR7 or TLR9.

            "text": "TLRs are divided into two subgroups according to their initial activation sites in the cells. One group, including TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR11, is expressed on the plasma membrane and mainly recognizes protein, lipid, and lipoprotein in microbial membrane components. The other group includes TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, which recognize nucleic acids and are localized in the intracellular vesicles such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and endosome. Endosome localization of TLRs is regulated by the ER-localized multi-membrane spanning protein UNC93B1. DCs from mice with a single missense mutation at UNC93B1 have defects in cytokine production by TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 ligands (26) , and these mice are susceptible to the DNA virus, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (27) . UNC93B1 binds to the transmembrane region of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 and transports these TLRs from the ER to the endolysosome (28, 29) . The adapter protein 3 (AP3), a well-known trafficking protein for cargo formation, has been shown to be critical for TLR9 trafficking and type I IFN production in pDCs (30) . The physiological reason for the restricted localization of TLRs is not clear, but TLR9, not TLR7, requires acidification at the endolysosome (31) . Synthetic nucleotides or nucleic acids derived from dead Overview of signaling pathway in nucleic acid-sensing TLRs. Nucleic acid-sensing TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are localized in the endolysosome and recognize nucleic acids that enter the endolysosome. TLR3 signals through TRIF, whereas TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signal through MyD88. Each adapter molecule induces complex formation of specific downstream signaling proteins. TRIF recruits TRAF6, TRAF3, TRADD, RIP1, and TAK1, and MyD88 recruits IRAK2, IRAK4, TRAF6, and TAK1. TAK1 induces activation of canonical IKKa \u2044 b complex, resulting in NF-jB activation. TRAF3 is recruited to TRIF and leads to activation of TBK1 and IKKi to phosphorylate IRF3. cells are directly endocytosed and delivered to the endolysosome where they encounter with TLRs. Viruses and microbes in which the genomic nucleic acids are covered with a membrane are also endocytosed and are likely to be recognized by TLRs after the nucleic acids are exposed through mechanisms which are unknown. Viruses pretreated with ultraviolet radiation are still able to induce cytokines via nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, suggesting that virus replication and growth of microbes are not directly linked to sensing.",

TLR3 recognizes genomic dsRNA of dsRNA viruses or dsRNA that are produced during replication of ssRNA viruses or DNA viruses. TLR3-deficient mice are susceptible to ssRNA viruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) (32), Semliki Forest virus (25) , and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (33) and DNA viruses such as mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (34) and HSV-1 (35) . TLR3 deficiency in humans also causes an increase in infection rates of HSV-1 (35) . The molecular mechanism of dsRNA binding to TLR3 is also revealed by structural analysis. The ectodomain is conserved through TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4. This site includes a large horseshoelike shape and forms a dimer with the binding pathogen, although the specific binding mechanism to the ligand differs between them. Structural analysis of the mouse TLR3 ectodomain interacting with dsRNA indicated that one end of the dsRNA of the sugar-phosphate backbone is sandwiched between two ectodomains at positively charged residues in each TLR3 (36, 37) . Positively charged residues in TLR3 sites are located in two regions near the N-and C-termini of the horseshoe, and the two binding sites are separated by approximately 120 \u00c5 , almost equal to approximately 45 base pairs of dsRNA in length. Supporting structural analysis, TLR3 binding to dsRNA is dependent on pH and dsRNA length. TLR3 does not bind to dsRNA at neutral pH but binds strongly at pH 6.5, which suggests that binding is mediated by a charged interaction, and requires 40-50 base pairs of dsRNA for stable binding (38) .",

Several types of CpG DNA have been tested for their abilities to induce cytokine production by pDCs, which suggests that there is a specific recognition mechanism.

STING is localized in the ER or mitochondria and may change distribution during activation, leading to TBK1 \u2044 IKKi-dependent IRF3 activation. recognize roughly one helical turn, namely a 5-8 amino acid sequence. In addition, binding analysis using several synthetic analogs such as the 5\u00a2-phosphorylated RNA or the blunt ended dsRNA suggests that the specific structure of the 5\u00a2 end is critical for binding to the C-terminal domain of RIG-I and MDA5. Consistent with its ligand preference, structural analysis indicated that the acidic surface of C-terminal binding site in RIG-I is important for recognition of the 5\u00a2 end of the RNA sequence (56) . The C-terminal region of MDA5 has a similar overall structure to that of RIG-I (57, 58), which does not fully explain the ligand preferences. Although the molecular mechanism for discrimination of RNA recognition between RIG-I and MDA5 is not fully clear, the receptor responsible for recognition of each virus was identified among fibroblast cells isolated from the knockout mouse. Viruses can be separated into three groups: those specifically sensitive to RIG-I, those specifically sensitive to MDA5, and those sensitive to both RIG-I and MDA5. The NDV, SeV, VSV, influenza virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus are specifically recognized by RIG-I. Piconaviruses including EMCV, Mengo virus, and Theiler's virus are recognized by MDA5. Dengue virus and WNV are recognized by both RIG-I and MDA5 (19, (59) (60) (61) (62) .",

The capping structure in self-mRNA is likely to be critical in distinguishing host RNA from viral RNA, but many viruses replicating in the cytoplasm develop other types of modification at the 5\u00a2 end (67) . They may also contain 5\u00a2 end modification enzymes such as RNA 5\u00a2 triphosphatase, RNA guanyltranferase, RNA N7-metyltransferase, or 2\u00a2-Omethyltransferase, which are homologous to the mammalian enzymes. A recent study clearly demonstrated the importance of one modification, 2\u00a2-O-methyltransferation in viral RNA. Coronavirus mutants lacking 2\u00a2-O-methyltransferase activity induce higher type I IFN production than viruses with 2\u00a2-Omethyltransferase activity through MDA5, suggesting that this RNA modification at the 5\u00a2 end is important for evasion of innate immune recognition (67) . MDA5 is likely to recognize viral RNA at the replication step before genomic RNA is masked by the 5\u00a2 end modification enzyme. To support this speculation, RIG-I was shown to recognize the viral genome at the replication step alongside the competing virus capping protein.",

E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) conjugates Lys-63-linked ubiquitin to RIG-I, enabling it to interact with an adapter protein IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, Cardif, and VISA) on mitochondria (70) . Formation of RIG-I and IPS-1 complexes induces the assembly of protein complexes to initiate downstream signaling (71) (72) (73) . IPS-1 binds to TRAF3 \u2044 6, caspase-8 \u2044 10, RIP1, FAS-associated death domain (FADD), and the TRADD (74) (75) (76) . This complex induces activation of IKKa \u2044 b followed by NF-jB activation, and TBK1 \u2044 IKKi that induce IRF3 activation, leading to production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs, respectively (77, 78) . The physiological role of the localization of IPS-1 in the mitochondrion is not yet clear, but several mitochondrial regulatory proteins are involved in signaling (79) . NLRX1, an NLR family member localized on the mitochondrial membrane is an inhibitor of IPS-1 signaling (80, 81) . Mitofusin 2, which is a regulator of mitochondrial fusion, suppresses IPS-1 signaling by direct interaction (82, 83) . The importance of mitochondrial regulation is indirectly supported by experiments in mice that lack autophagy. It has been shown that ATG5-or ATG16L1-deficient cells accumulate damaged mitochondria with IPS-1 and induce robust type I IFN induction (84, 85) (Fig. 2) .",

IL-1b is produced following activation of inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that activates caspase-1 with the subsequent cleavage of pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18 and release of mature IL-1b and IL-18 (90) . AIM2 has the HIN2000 DNA-binding domain and the pyrin domain that interacts with an adapter protein ASC. Single-stranded CpG DNA as short as six bases is sufficient for TLR9 recognition, whereas activation of AIM2 requires DNA at least 44 base pairs in length, suggesting that oligomer formation by binding through the HIN2000 domain onto longer DNA is necessary for AIM2 inflammasome activation (91) . The preference for longer DNA for cluster formation is demonstrated by the fact that AIM2 and DNA form a puncta structure within the cells. AIM2-deficient cells fail to produce IL-1b in response to viral DNA and certain bacterial DNA that is released into the cytoplasm. AIM2-deficient mice display reduced survival following infection with Gram-negative bacteria Francisella tularensis and MCMV (92, 93) .",

Further analysis showed DAI knockdown in L929 cells, but not MEF cells, suppressed INFb production after synthetic DNA stimulation, suggesting a cell type specific role of DAI (96) . Secondly, IFI16, a member of HIN2000 domain-containing protein, was also proposed as an intracellular DNA sensor (97) . IFNb production was suppressed by knockdown of IFI16 in Raw 264.7 cells after synthetic DNA transfection and HSV-1 infection. Thirdly, DExD \u2044 H-box helicase 36 (DHX36) and DHX9 have been proposed as cytosolic CpG DNA sensors in pDCs (98) . DHX36 and DHX9 have a helicase domain for recognition of DNA and have been shown to participate in MyD88-dependent signaling. DHX36 and DHX9 have sequence preferences for bind-ing, and knockdown of these proteins suppressed cytokine production by infection with DNA HSV-1 virus. These studies support the suggestion that cytosolic DNA sensors are probably not single molecules and function in different cell types.",

However, structural differences, such as the high levels of unmethylated CpG motifs in viral DNA for TLR9 and clusters of U or GU-rich sequences in viral RNA for TLR7, have been considered key factors in the discrimination between self and non-self nucleic acids. In addition to sequence preference, all nucleic acidsensing TLRs are localized in the endosome and the specific localization in the cells clearly protects them from access to self-nucleic acid (113, 114) . Supporting these findings, several DNA-binding proteins are proposed to facilitate the development of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. LL37 was implicated in mediating TLR9 and TLR7 responses to selfnucleic acids in psoriasis, a common chronic inflammatory disease in the skin (49, 115) . LL37 was isolated from psoriasis patient samples accompanied by high level of IFNa in pDCs. LL37 binds to self-DNA and -RNA, and protects it from degradation by DNase and facilitates internalization. HMBG1 is another protein that facilitates entry of self-nucleic acids into cells by forming complexes. Initial reports have demonstrated that extracellular DNA released from dying cells in these complexes is recognized by TLR9 (116, 117) . Several mechanisms for internalization process are proposed. One report demonstrated that HMGB1 associates with receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE), inducing endocytosis, and these binding complexes activate TLR9 in the endosome (117) . Another report demonstrated that HMGB1 and the related family members HMGB2 and HMGB3 bind to DNA or RNA and activate TLRs and cytosolic nucleic sensors, captur-ing both self and non-self nucleic acids to present them to sensors (48) . In systematic autoimmune diseases such as SLE, scleroderma, and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, antibodies against self-DNA complexed with DNA from dead cells are internalized by FccRII on B cells and DCs (118) . The antibody complexes activate TLRs or cytosolic DNA sensors to produce an excess of type I IFNs, which precipitates the development and progression of systemic autoimmune diseases (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "SLE is a chronic inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease which affects the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, and other organs. Mice which have the homozygous LPR mutation (lpr \u2044 lpr) does not express the functional death receptor (FAS) and develop an SLE-like disease (118) . The lpr \u2044 lpr mice produce antibodies against self-DNA or nucleic acid-associated protein, and self-antibody production is commonly used for evaluating the degree of the SLE phenotype. Initial study demonstrated a critical link between innate immunity and systemic autoimmunity in B cells (107) . Consistent with the initial finding, lpr \u2044 lpr mice deficient in MyD88 do not produce autoantibody (108) , but the contribution of TLR7 or TLR9 is controversial. TLR7 deficiency in lpr \u2044 lpr mice reduced the level of autoantibodies against RNA Fig. 3 . Self-nucleic acid recognition mechanisms and degradation of DNA. Self-nucleic acids, which are produced from necrotic or apoptotic cells, are internalized via several pathways and induce innate immune responses. Extracellular DNA is degraded by DNase I, but some of this escapes from degradation by binding to intermediate proteins, such as autoantibodies, LL37, or HMGB1. DNA-protein complexes facilitate internalization through the endocytosis pathway by binding to specific mediators. DNase II plays a role similar to DNase I after self-DNA internalization or degradation of DNA derived from phagocytosed apoptotic cells in the macrophage. DNase III degrades intracellular DNA derived from the retro element from genomic DNA, which is likely to prevent activation of the cytosolic DNA sensor. and RNA-binding proteins and increased mouse survival. However, TLR9 deficiency in lpr \u2044 lpr mice also decreased autoantibody production against self-DNA, facilitating disease level and increasing survival (119) . Another SLE-like disease mouse model, involving mutation of Ali5 that increases the function of phospholipase-Cc2, also aggravated disease and increased production of self-antibody, when crossed with TLR9-deficient mice (120) . The reason for unexpected difference in TLR9 is not clear, but one possible explanation is that the cytosolic DNA sensor is redundantly contributing to the production of self-antibody. Recently DHX36 and DHX9 have been proposed as cytosolic DNA sensors that mediate a signal though MyD88 in the helicase domain (98) . This function is supported by the demonstration of MyD88 dependency for self-antibody production in lpr \u2044 lpr mice. The TLR7-dependent signal might also be contributing to TLR9 activation in the lpr \u2044 lpr mice model (121) . More direct evidence for the contribution of the TLR signal in SLE has been revealed by the discovery of a Y chromosome-linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) mutation, causing an SLE-like disease in mice. The Yaa mutation results from translocation of a 4 megabase translocation of the X chromosome to the Y chromosome, leading to a twofold increase in genes in the region containing TLR7 gene (122, 123) . A later study shows that overexpression of TLR7 is sufficient for inducing an SLE-like disease (124) . To stimulate adaptive immunity by self-DNA-antibody, it is necessary for the antibody complexes to be internalized for activation of TLR7 or TLR9. Aberrant expression of type I IFNs is correlated with disease severity in SLE (118) . Several processes for internalization of DNA-antibody complexes have been proposed for the activation of TLRs. One major activation process is internalization through FccRIII or FccRIIa on the DCs, which are the main source of type I IFNs to develop disease in lpr \u2044 lpr mice (125, 126) . The Fc region of DNA-antibody complexes is recognized by FccR and internalized DNA is recognized by TLR9 in the endosomes. Blocking peptides specific to the FccR did not stimulate pDCs by immune complex from an SLE patient (127) . The alternative process is internalization through the BCR-mediated endocytosis pathway. B cells expressing an antigen receptor specific for self-IgG internalize DNA-IgG2a-chromatin immune complexes by synergistic engagement of the antigen receptor (107) (Fig. 3) .",

Glucocorticoids have strong anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-jB activity (128) , but it is not clear why SLE patients commonly need higher doses of glucocorticoids than patients with other autoimmune disease. Furthermore, oral administration of glucocorticoids does not affect IFNa production. Recent findings show that nucleic acid-containing immune complexes activate NF-jB through TLR7 or TLR9, and activation of NF-jB is suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment (129) . This finding supports the importance of TLR activation in development of SLE. Inhibition of TLR signaling may provide an effective control for SLE in the future.",

            "text": "Autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases are potentially induced by inappropriate clearance of self-nucleic acids (Fig. 3 ). Although the relationship between self-nucleic acid recognition and disease onset in each autoimmune disease is difficult to establish from clinical evidence, several mouse models that display defects in self-nucleic acid clearance show an autoimmune disease-like phenotype. There are three types of mammalian DNases that mediate the degradation of self \u2044 non-self DNA: DNase I, DNase II, and DNase III (TREX). DNase I is mainly present in serum and degrades extracellular dsDNA into tri-or tetra-oligonucleotides (130) . DNase I-deficient mice develop glomerulonephritis, a feature of SLE. In humans, mutations in the dnase I gene are associated with SLE, and low DNase I activity is correlated with glomerulonephritis in patients (131) . DNase II is present in the lysosomes of macrophages and is important for degradation of DNA derived from phagocytosed apoptotic cells. DNase II-deficient mice induce accumulation of undigested DNA in macrophages, and the resulting production of IFNb and TNF causes embryonic death (132) . Embryonic lethality is rescued by type I IFN receptor deficiency (133) , but the mouse still suffers arthritis by production of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, IL-1b, and IL-6. DNase III (Trex1), which is a 3\u00a2 repair exonuclease, is localized in the cytosol, and is involved in clearance of cytosolic DNA from the retro element from self-genome DNA (134) . DNase III-deficient mice increase production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs probably through activation of an intracellular DNA sensor. DNA intrinsically accumulated in the cells by dysregulation of clearance is related to autoimmunity and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome in humans (135, 136) . However, a sensor for accumulated DNA by dysregulation of the relevant DNases has not been demonstrated. DNA derived from DNase II-deficient mice produce cytokines independently on MyD88 and TRIF (137) . As with self-DNA clearance, dysregulation of self-RNA clearance by mutations in SAMHD1, an RNase H2 subunit, is also associated with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (138) . The receptors responsible for self-RNA recognition in this situation remain unidentified.",

Nucleic acids from pathogens cause production of cytokines and type I IFNs to protect from invasion. Aberrant recogni-tion of self-nucleic acid also causes similar responses against pathogen but may induce autoimmune diseases. TLR7 and TLR9 are involved in autoimmune diseases, but contributions of cytosolic sensors such as RLRs and DNA sensors to the development of autoimmune diseases remains unclear. After the discovery of TLRs, knowledge about sensing mechanisms, signaling schemes, types of sensors, or target pathogens has greatly accumulated, but we still do not know mechanisms by which TLR-mediated signaling pathways are aberrantly activated in other immune diseases. A combination of clinical and experimental approaches will be important for resolving many of the current questions, and we expect that accumulation of knowledge in innate immunity will help in the treatment and management of immune disease in the future.",

Nucleic acid-sensing TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are localized in the endolysosome and recognize nucleic acids that enter the endolysosome. TLR3 signals through TRIF, whereas TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signal through MyD88. Each adapter molecule induces complex formation of specific downstream signaling proteins. TRIF recruits TRAF6, TRAF3, TRADD, RIP1, and TAK1, and MyD88 recruits IRAK2, IRAK4, TRAF6, and TAK1. TAK1 induces activation of canonical IKKa \u2044 b complex, resulting in NF-jB activation. TRAF3 is recruited to TRIF and leads to activation of TBK1 and IKKi to phosphorylate IRF3.",
