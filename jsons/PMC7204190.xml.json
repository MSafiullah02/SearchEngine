To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating anti-ORF8a antibody reactivity in patients with SARS. It has been reported that the region immediately upstream of orf8a  gene contains a consensus transcription regulating sequence (TRS) [22, 23].

Furthermore, compared with the siRNA-GFP control, siRNA-orf8a  inhibited >50% of the replication of SARS-CoV (figure 3B ). Previous studies have shown that both cellular and viral proteins can enhance the transcription of CoV via interaction with its leader RNA and TRS [29-31]. We performed a UV cross-linking assay to examine whether ORF8a has RNA-binding activity. Preliminary results showed that neither positive-strand nor negative-strand leader RNA of SARS-CoV interacted with GST-ORF8a fusion protein directly. It cannot be ruled out that the ORF8a protein interacts with leader RNA indirectly through other cellular proteins or that orf8a  RNA other than the ORF8a protein is the basis of these effects. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of transactivation of ORF8a.",

A consensus sequence motif containing a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain 18\u201324 aa in length and flanked by positively charged residues for directing proteins to mitochondria has already been defined [32]. This motif exists in many viral proteins that target mitochondria, including the Bam HI fragment H rightward ORF1 in Epstein-Barr virus, F1L in vaccinia virus, and vBcl-2 in human herpesvirus type 8 [33-35]. According to the results of our sequence analysis, there is a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain at the N-terminal region of ORF8a. This membrane-spanning domain is 19 aa in length and is surrounded by positively charged amino acids (table 1). Therefore, ORF8a may be located in mitochondria through a mitochondria-targeting signal at its N-terminal region.",

It has been suggested that both apoptotic suppression and induction can be beneficial to viral replication, persistence, dissemination, and pathogenesis. Our results indicate that overexpression of ORF8a resulted in the hyperpolarization of mitochondria membrane potential, an increase in ROS production, and cell apoptosis. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization is known to be associated with yeast and lymphoblastoid cells committed to apoptosis [39, 40]. ORF8a therefore regulates the production of free radicals and causes hyperpolarization of membrane potential, which is a sensitive indicator of mitochondrial function, resulting in the occurrence of apoptosis [41, 42].",
