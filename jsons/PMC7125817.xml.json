Hethcote [1] is one of the pioneers who proposed epidemic models with population dispersal between two patches. Subsequently, numerous studies have contributed to investigations on the effect of population migration on the spread of disease, and to determining whether migration can increase disease persistence. When formulating such disease models with migration, the adoption of a constant or adaptive dispersal is considered.",

We examined SIS models with a constant dispersal rate in [2,[3], [4]]. The main results include (1) establishing a threshold below which the disease becomes extinction and above which the disease persists and tends toward a certain level; and (2) identifying the effect of the dispersal rate on this critical value. From the designed examples, they revealed that, depending on other parameters in the system, changing the dispersal rate in a certain patch may either benefit or damage the capacity for disease control. However, the random behavior of each individual can be affected by change of the environment or social consideration. Accordingly, the authors in [4] proposed a compelling but unsolved problem in studying an epidemic model with a variable dispersal rate. In epidemiology, [5] is one of the few studies that examined adaptive dispersal among patches by applying mathematical models. Managing wildlife through culling, vaccination, and habitat management is efficient for disease control [6]. Therefore, the authors in [5] developed a mathematical model to describe the effect of increased movement caused by culling individuals. However, from a mathematical perspective, this model involves additional nonlinearity, and leaves the global dynamics of the endemic case unsolved.",

Recent studies [7], [8] have taken media coverage within a habitat into consideration to study epidemic problems. The present paper proposes an endemic model with density-dependent dispersal among patches by considering two facts: First, information on disease spread and the characteristics of pathogens is revealed through international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, and quickly communicated through media coverage, such as through television news, newspapers, Internet news, and mobile instant messaging. Education on the latent periods of disease typically results in individuals taking precautions against crowding and adopting social distancing. Second, animals have a natural reaction against disease, which possibly leads to blind escaping from crowding. In addition, the carrying capacity for a species within an area does not change according to the population number, and offspring must establish their own habitat [9].",

We discuss how the dispersal rates of individuals depend on the population number in the habitat and the destination, and propose a class of functional responses to formulate the adaptive dispersal rates. Section 3 presents a calculation of the basic reproduction number of the connected patches, and a discussion on how media intensity influences this threshold value. To present a dynamic investigation in one model consistently, we treated a particular case and obtained global dynamics according to different levels of disease spread. In addition to the theoretical results regarding dynamical characteristics, we present examples to discuss changes in the population number concerning the strategy of adaption in Section 4. This paper concludes by presenting a brief comparison of our results with those of other studies as well as a discussion on prediction concerns.",

In the absence of media effect, population disperse randomly; that is, individuals travel among patches with constant dispersal rates. When media coverage is taken into account, the density of population will affect the strategy of migration among patches. Naturally the adaptive dispersal rate is not only related to the alertness to the disease of individuals, but also closely related to the number of total population due to obscure symptoms in the initial infection. Therefore, we comprehend the population behaviors of escaping from crowds by two factors: the dispersal rate has positive (respectively, negative) functional response to the number of total population in the habitat (respectively, destination). Therefore, we consider an adaptive dispersal rate of susceptible (respectively, infectious) individuals from patch-j to patch-i, evaluated by fij(Ni, Nj) (respectively, gij(Ni, Nj)), Ni(t)=Si(t)+Ii(t), which satisfies\n(H1)fij,gij\u2208C1fori,j\u2208P,and\u2202fij(x1,x2)\u2202x1\u22640,\u2202fij(x1,x2)\u2202x2\u22650,similarlyforgij,i,j\u2208P,i\u2260j,(H2)fii(Ni,Ni)=\u2212\u2211j\u2208P,j\u2260ifji(Nj,Ni),gii(Ni,Ni)=\u2212\u2211j\u2208P,j\u2260igji(Nj,Ni),fori\u2208P.The assumption \u2202fij(x1,x2)\u2202x1\u22640 (respectively, \u2202fij(x1,x2)\u2202x2\u22650) in (H1) indicates that the population of the destination (habitat) reduces (enhances) the dispersal rate to avoid infection. The assumption (H2) means that both the death rate and the birth rate of the individual are neglected during the dispersal process, because of either the fast traffic system or the dispersal between neighboring patches.",

To explore a positive response in biological mechanisms, saturation or nonsaturation of the response is a trait merits consideration. It is therefore necessary to experiment with both cases. In addition, there may be examples without inter-elusion, i.e., cij=0 for i, j \u2208 P, due to inaccessibility of outer-information in wildlife. Accordingly, we propose two further examples for different types of mental response to media alert:\n(N\u2032){fij(Ni,Nj)=aij+bijNj1+Nj,gij(Ni,Nj)=a\u02dcij+b\u02dcijNj1+Nj,\n(L){fij(Ni,Nj)=aij+bijNj,gij(Ni,Nj)=a\u02dcij+b\u02dcijNj.The functions in type (N\u2032) indicate a nonlinear and saturated response to population number while those in type (L) represent linear response and unlimited adaption. A biological reason that the p patches cannot be separated into two groups such that there is no migration of individuals between different groups suggests that the p \u00d7 p matrices (fij(Ni, Nj)) and (gij(Ni, Nj)) are irreducible whenever Ni, Nj \u2265 0 (see, for example, [11, Appendix A]).\nRemark 1\n1.The special case of (N) with bij=b\u02dcij=cij=c\u02dcij=0 indicates the absence of media coverage and individuals traveling at constant rates. Epidemic models with this migration strategy have been studied in several literature, for example, see [3], [4], [12].2.Author in [13] studied a discrete-generation model of a single species with density-dependent migration among a chain of habitat fragments, and proposed a model with migration rates depending increasingly on the number of local population. Assumption (H1) for fij and gij agrees with this theory of adaptive dispersal rates.3.If bij,b\u02dcij>0, and both are small enough with respective to aij and a\u02dcij, the dispersal rates fij and gij are closed to aij and a\u02dcij, respectively, and it represents weak media effect. As bij,b\u02dcij are large, media coverage is comprehensive and the public will be more aware of crowds. Hence, an increase of total population in a habitat will result in higher adaption in dispersal rate.4.When a media coverage arises in patch-j, consideration of spatial heterogeneity allows for different bi1j and bi2j for i\n1 \u2260 i\n2 because they relate to different destinations. The common rule is that stronger media coverage or more severe levels of panic in patch-j assumes larger bi1j and bi2j.\n\n",

Note that system (3.1) is cooperative, and each solution orbit has compact closure in {(x1,x2,\u2026,xp)\u2208Rp:0\u2264xi\u2264\u2211i\u2208PAi/d*fori\u2208P}. By Lemma 1 in [16], the system (3.1) admits a positive equilibrium, denoted by S0=(S10,S20,,\u2026,Sp0).Next, we claim that the system (3.1) has unique positive equilibrium. Assume, by contrary, that S\u02dc0=(S\u02dc10,S\u02dc20,,\u2026,S\u02dcp0) is also a positive equilibrium of (3.1). Since the system (3.1) is cooperative and irreducible, the generated semiflow \u03a6t is strongly monotone [15, Theorem 4.1.1] . Without loss of generality, we say S0\u226aS\u02dc0. From (3.1), we have\nAi\u2212diSi0+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Si0,Sj0)Sj0=0,Ai\u2212diS\u02dci0+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(S\u02dci0,S\u02dcj0)S\u02dcj0=0,for i \u2208 P, and then the assumption (H2) implies\n\u2211i\u2208P(Ai\u2212diSi0)=0and\u2211i\u2208P(Ai\u2212diS\u02dci0)=0.This contradicts to the assumption S0\u226aS\u02dc0. Thus, S\n0 is the unique positive equilibrium of (3.1).To see that S\n0 attracts all non-negative orbits of (3.1), we first note that there exists \u03f50 > 0 small enough such that F(\u03f5^)\u226b0, where \u03f5^=(\u03f5,\u03f5,\u2026,\u03f5) and 0 < \u03f5 \u2264 \u03f50. For given S\u02dc\u2208IntR+p, there exists r\n1, r\n2 > 0 such that r1\u03f50^\u226aS\u02dc\u226ar21^. We choose positive r\n2 large enough such that F(r21^)\u226a0. From [15, Proposition 3.2.1], \u03a6t(r1\u03f50^) and \u03a6t(r21^) both converge to S\n0. By the strong monotonicity of the semiflow \u03a6t, we have \u03a6t(r1\u03f50^)\u226a\u03a6t(S\u02dc)\u226a\u03a6t(r21^) for t > 0, and conclude that \u03a6t(S\u02dc)\u2192S0 as t \u2192 \u221e. This completes the proof. \u25a1\nRemark 2Previous result is also true for the system (2.1) with other birth rate function, for example, pie\u2212qiNi,\npi, qi > 0 and pi > di, in [3], [4]. But, with the birth rate function piNim+qi,\npiqi>di and m > 0, addressed in [3], [4], it fails to show the unique DFE for the system (2.1) by previous manner. In fact, an SIS model incorporated with such a birth rate as well as constant dispersal rates may involve multiple stability [4].\n",

However, neither the standard comparison principle used by Sun et al. [8] nor the reduction-like property quoted in [19], [20] can be applied to model (2.1) due to its adaptive dispersal. Hereafter, we assume that there is no disease-induced death (i.e., \u03bdi=0 for i \u2208 P), and susceptible and infectious individuals travel at the identical rates (i.e., fij=gij for i, j \u2208 P). The system (2.1) becomes\n(3.4)dSidt=Ai\u2212diSi\u2212\u03b2iSiIiNi+\u03b3iIi+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Ni,Nj)Sj,dIidt=\u03b2iSiIiNi\u2212(di+\u03b3i)Ii+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Ni,Nj)Ij,\ni \u2208 P. To study the global dynamics of (3.4), we add the two equations in system (3.4), and obtain the equivalent one\n(3.5)dNidt=Ai\u2212diNi+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Ni,Nj)Nj,\n(3.6)dIidt=\u03b2i(Ni\u2212Ii)IiNi\u2212(di+\u03b3i)Ii+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Ni,Nj)Ij,\ni \u2208 P. The local stability of the disease-free equilibrium E\n0 in system (3.4) is fully determined by R0. With a help of Lemma 1, we follow the method in [3] to show the global stability of the DFE when R0<1, as in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2\nThe disease-free equilibrium E\n0\nof\n(3.4)\nis globally asymptotically stable when\nR0<1\nand unstable when\nR0>1\n.\n\nProofFrom Lemma 1, subsystem (3.5) has a unique equilibrium, denoted by N0=(N10,N20,\u2026,Np0), which is globally asymptotically stable in R+p. Note that N0=S0. Since Ni(t)\u2192Ni0 as t \u2192 \u221e for i \u2208 P, given small \u03b6 > 0 there is a large enough t\n2 such that Ni0\u2212\u03b6<Ni(t)<Ni0+\u03b6 for t > t\n2 and i \u2208 P.Set\nV\u03b6=(\u03b4ij(di+\u03bdi+\u03b3i)+fij(Si0\u2212\u03b6,Sj0+\u03b6))p\u00d7p.Since (H1), (H2) hold and the spectral radius of a matrix is continuous in each elementary, the spectral radius of FV\u03b6\u22121 is continuous in \u03b6. Thus, we can choose a positive constant \u03b6 small enough such that \u03c1(FV\u03b6\u22121)<1. For t \u2265 t\n2, from (3.6) and (H1), it leads to\ndIidt\u2264\u03b2iIi\u2212(di+\u03b3i)Ii+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Si0\u2212\u03b6,Sj0+\u03b6)Ij.This suggests the following comparison linear system for (3.6)\n(3.7)dwidt=\u03b2iwi\u2212(di+\u03b3i)wi+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Si0\u2212\u03b6,Sj0+\u03b6)wj.Since V is a non-singular M-matrix [18], we further choose \u03b6 > 0 small enough such that V\u03b6 remains as a non-singular M-matrix. Also note that F is non-negative. Hence, it holds that s(V\u03b6\u2212F)<0 if and only if \u03c1(FV\u03b6\u22121)<1, all eigenvalues of V\u03b6\u2212F are with negative real parts, see the proof of [18, Theorem 2] or [3, Lemma 2.1]. Thus, all non-negative solutions of (3.7) satisfies that limt\u2192\u221ewi(t)=0 for i \u2208 P. By a standard comparison principle [11, Theorem B.1] and the non-negativity of each Ii, we conclude that all non-negative solutions of (3.4) satisfy limt\u2192\u221eIi(t)=0 for i \u2208 P. This implies that (3.1) performs the limiting system of the S equation in (3.4), which has the dynamics of global convergence to S\n0. By the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems [21, Theorem 2.3] and [22], we conclude that all the solutions to (3.4) with (2.2) satisfy that limt\u2192\u221eSi(t)=Si0 for i \u2208 P. Therefore, the disease-free equilibrium E\n0 of (3.4) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R0<1, and hence completes the proof. \u25a1\n",

            "text": "The result in Theorem 2 means that R0 measures a sufficient condition for disease extinction. To determine whether it is pandemic in all considered regions, it is necessary to study a criterion for disease persistence. In the case of minor infection, the S-equation in (3.4) can be regarded as a perturbed system of (3.1). Substituting the convergent result of such a perturbed system into the I-equation in (3.4) facilitates investigating whether the disease persists or not. To this end, we further extend the result in Lemma 1 to the perturbed system\n(3.8)dSidt=A\u02dci\u2212d\u02dciSi+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Si,Sj)Sj+\u03b8\u2211j\u2208P,j\u2260iSj,i\u2208P,where A\u02dci>0,\nd\u02dci>0 and \u03b8 are all constants, and |\u03b8| is sufficiently small. Cooperativity is the main property to be used in proving global dynamics of (3.1). However, (3.8) may not be cooperative due to the perturbed term \u03b8\u2211j \u2208 P, j \u2260 i\nSj, and then a perturbation theory [23] is necessary to demonstrating a globally stable equilibrium. We denote the perturbed parameters by \u03bb=(A\u02dc,d\u02dc,\u03b8), where A\u02dc=(A\u02dc1,A\u02dc2,\u2026,A\u02dcp) and d\u02dc=(d\u02dc1,d\u02dc2,\u2026,d\u02dcp). From Lemma 1, the Eq. (3.8) has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium S\u02dc0(\u03bb\u02dc0), where \u03bb\u02dc0=(A\u02dc,d\u02dc,0).\nLemma 2\nLet\nc:=mini\u2208PA\u02dci/\u2211i\u2208P,j\u2260iS\u02dci0\n. The perturbed equation\n3.8\nhas a positive equilibrium S\n0(\u03bb) that is globally asymptotically stable on U (respectively,\nR+p\n) if\n\u2212c<\u03b8<0\n(respectively, \u03b8 > 0), where\nU:={S\u2208R+p|Si\u2264S\u02dci0fori\u2208P}\n. Moreover, the equilibrium S\n0(\u03bb) is continuous in \u03bb.\n\nProofWe shall prove the first case, and the second one can be shown in the same manner and a simpler calculation. Set \u039b={(A\u02dc,d\u02dc,\u03b8):|A\u02dc,d\u02dc\u22650,\u2212c<\u03b8<0}. Again, from Lemma 1, the Eq. (3.8) has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium S\n0(\u03bb\n0), where \u03bb0=(A,d,0) and A=(A1,A2,\u2026,Ap),\nd=(d1,d2,\u2026,dp). Next, we show that U is positively invariant under the solution flow of (3.8) whenever \u2212c<\u03b8<0. Suppose there is one of the first Si*(t3)=0 for t\n3 \u2265 0. From (3.8) and non-negativity of each Si, fij, we obtain\ndSi*(t3)dt\u2265A\u02dci*+\u03b8\u2211i\u2208P,j\u2260i*S\u02dci0>0,which is a contradiction. Hence, each solution of (3.8) starting from the region U will never leave it from the boundary with at least one zero component. In addition, such a solution satisfies\ndSidt\u2264A\u02dci\u2212d\u02dciSi+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Si,Sj)Sj,since \u03b8 < 0. As mentioned previously, the upper system\ndS\u02dcidt=A\u02dci\u2212d\u02dciS\u02dci+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(S\u02dci,S\u02dcj)S\u02dcj,has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium S\u02dc0(\u03bb\u02dc0). By the comparison theory in [15, Theorem 5.1.1], Si(t)\u2264S\u02dci(t) for all t \u2265 0. Since S\u02dc0(\u03bb\u02dc0) is an equilibrium, each solution of (3.8) starting from the region U will stay therein forever. Therefore, all solutions to the family of perturbed systems (3.8) are eventually uniformly bounded. By Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.3 in [23], we prove the existence of a unique equilibrium that varies continuously in the perturbed parameters, and its global stability under the solution flow of (3.8). \u25a1\n",

By [15, Theorem 5.1.1] and the comparison of (3.10), (3.11) with the original S equation, it holds that S\u02c70(\u03be)\u2264S^0(\u03be). Since S^0(\u03be) and S\u02c70(\u03be) are continuous in \u03be, for given \u03b7 > 0, we can choose small \u03be such that S0\u2212\u03b7<S\u02c70(\u03be)<S^0(\u03be)<S0+\u03b7. Again, by the comparison theorem [15, Theorem 5.1.1], there is a t\n6 \u2265 max {t\n4, t\n5} such that S0\u2212\u03b7<S(t)<S0+\u03b7 for t \u2265 t\n6. Hence, for t \u2265 t\n6,\ndIidt\u2265\u03b2i(1\u2212\u03be)Ii\u2212(di+\u03b3i)Ii+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Si0+\u03b7+\u03be,Sj0\u2212\u03b7)Ij,i\u2208P.Since F\u03be is non-negative, V\u03be,\u03b7 is a non-singular M-matrix for small enough \u03be and \u03b7 and \u03c1(F\u03beV\u03be,\u03b7\u22121)>1, the matrix M:=F\u03be\u2212V\u03be,\u03b7 has a positive eigenvalue s(M) associated with a positive eigenvector [18], it follows that limt\u2192\u221eIi(t)=\u221e, for i \u2208 P, which is a contradiction. Hence, the inequality (3.9) holds.Consider system (3.4), E\n0 is globally asymptotically stable in M\n\u2202, and then {E\n0} is an isolated invariant set and acyclic in M\n\u2202. Therefore, by Thieme [24, Theorem 4.6], it follows that system (3.4) is uniformly persistent with respect to (X\n0, \u2202X\n0). Moreover, from [25, Theorem 2.4], system (3.4) has an endemic equilibrium (S\u00af,I\u00af)\u2208X0. \u25a1\nRemark 3Obviously, by using the same manner, we can also show uniform persistence in the general model (2.1) without the restriction in Theorem 3.\n",

Since Ni(t)\u2192Ni0 as t \u2192 \u221e for i \u2208 P, the system (3.5) and (3.6) has the limiting subsystem\n(3.12)dIidt=\u03b2i(Ni0\u2212Ii)IiNi0\u2212(di+\u03b3i)Ii+\u2211j\u2208Pfij(Ni0,Nj0)Ij,for i \u2208 P. Denote the right hand side of system (3.12) by the function \u0393:R+p\u2192Rp, and let \u03a8tI be the corresponding solution flow. For given \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and I\u2208IntR+p, it holds that \u0393(\u03b1I) > \u03b1\u0393(I); that is, \u0393 is strongly sub-linear on R+p\n[27]. In addition, since R0>1, the Jacobian matrix of (3.12), D\u0393(0)=F\u2212V, satisfies s(D\u0393(0)) > 0. Therefore, there is a globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium I* with respect to R+p\u2216{0}\n[27, Corollary 3.2].Let \u03a8t(N(0), I(0)) denote the solution flow generated by (3.5) and (3.6). By Theorem 1, the orbit {\u03a8t(N(0), I(0))|t > 0} is precompact, and the forward limit set of (N, I) exists, denoted by \u03c9\u03a8(N, I). Let \u03c9\u03a8I(N,I) be the projection of \u03c9\u03a8(N, I) onto {(N,I)\u2208R+2p|N=N0}. From Theorem 3, we obtain \u03c9\u03a8I(N,I)\u2286{(N0,I)|I\u22650)}\u2216{(N0,0)}. Since I* is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of (3.12) in R+p\u2216{0}, it follows that \u03c9\u03a8I(N,I) contains I*. By the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems [21, Theorem 2.3], we conclude that the equilibrium E*=(N0,I*) is a globally attractor in X\n1.Next, we show that the endemic equilibrium E* is locally asymptotically stable. It is equivalent to examine the stability of the Jacobian matrix of the system (3.4) at E*, i.e.,\nJ(E*)=(J110J21J22),where J\n11, J\n21, J\n22 are p \u00d7 p matrices defined as\nJ11=((\u2212di\u2212\u2211k\u2208P,k\u2260i\u2202fki(Nk*,Ni*)\u2202x2Ni*+\u2211k\u2208P,k\u2260i\u2202fik(Ni*,Nk*)\u2202x1Nk*\u2212\u2211k\u2208P,k\u2260ifki(Nk*,Ni*))\u03b4ij+(\u2212\u2202fji(Nj*,Ni*)\u2202x1Ni*+\u2202fij(Ni*,Nj*)\u2202x2Nj*+fij(Ni*,Nj*))(1\u2212\u03b4ij)),J21=((\u03b2i(Ii*Ni*)2\u2212\u2211k\u2208P,k\u2260i\u2202fki(Nk*,Ni*)\u2202x2Ii*+\u2211k\u2208P,k\u2260i\u2202fik(Ni*,Nk*)\u2202x1Ik*)\u03b4ij+(\u2212\u2202fji(Nj*,Ni*)\u2202x1Ii*+\u2202fij(Ni*,Nj*)\u2202x2Ij*)(1\u2212\u03b4ij)),J22=((\u03b2iNi*\u22122Ii*Ni*\u2212(di+\u03b3i)\u2212\u2211k\u2208P,k\u2260ifki(Nk*,Ni*))\u03b4ij+fij(Ni*,Nj*)(1\u2212\u03b4ij)).It is sufficient to show the stability of both J\n11 and J\n22. From (H1), (H2) and di > 0, J\n11 is an irreducible and quasi-positive matrix with negative column sum, and then we have s(J\n11) < 0 from the Perron\u2013Frobenius Theorem; see, for example, [15, Corollary 4.3.2]. From (3.5), J\u02dc22(I*)t=0, where\nJ\u02dc22=((\u03b2iNi*\u2212Ii*Ni*\u2212(di+\u03b3i))\u03b4ij+fij(Ni*,Nj*))p\u00d7p,and then s(J\u02dc22)=0. In addition, a direct calculation gives\nJ22\u2212J\u02dc22=(\u2212\u03b2iIi*Ni*\u03b4ij)p\u00d7p<0.From [15, Corollary 4.3.2], we have s(J\n22) < 0. Therefore, the endemic equilibrium E* is locally asymptotically stable, and it completes the proof of the theorem. \u25a1\n",

            "text": "When the threshold R0>1 in (3.4), the following result shows that the existence and the globally asymptotical stability of the unique endemic equilibrium still hold in (2.1) when the disease has mild effect on the dispersal of infectious individuals, i.e. gij(\u00b7,\u00b7) \u2248 fij(\u00b7,\u00b7) in (2.1), and the disease rarely induces death, i.e. \u03bdi \u2248 0 in (2.1). To study this case, we regard the variable dispersal rate of infectious individuals as the perturbation of the variable dispersal rate of susceptible individuals. By using a perturbation result for a globally stable equilibrium in [23], we present a proof analogous to those in [4], [28]. First, we set further notations to discuss this issue in (2.1). Equip the space of continuous functions R+p\u2192R+2p with the \u221e-norm \u2016g\u2016\u221e \u2254 max i, j\u2016gij\u2016\u221e for g=(gij),\ni, j \u2208 P, where \u2016h\u2016\u221e is the essential supremum of the function |h| for h:R+2\u2192R. The neighborhood of the function f=(fij),\ni, j \u2208 P, is defined as\nB(f,\u025b)={g=(gij)|\u2225gij\u2212fij\u2225\u221e<\u025b,fori,j\u2208P}.\nTheorem 5\nAssume (H1), (H2) hold and\nR0>1\nfor\nf=g\n. For this fixed\nf, there exists an constant\n\u025b\u00af>0\nsuch that for any\ng\u2208B(f,\u025b\u00af)\nwith gij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P, the system\n(2.1)\nadmits a unique endemic equilibrium\nE*(g)=(S*(g),I*(g)),\nwhich is globally asymptotically stable with respect to X\n1\n.\n\nProofNote that the disease-free equilibrium (S\n0, 0) is independent in functions g. By (H1) and (H2), R0 is continuous in the function g. From the assumption, there exists an \u03b50 > 0 such that R0>1 for g \u2208 B(f, \u03b50). Let \u03a0(g, t) denotes the solution flow generated by (2.1). By Theorem 1, the bounded and closed set G satisfies that for any (S, I) \u2208 X\n1 and gij with g \u2208 B(f, \u03b50), there exists t7=t7((S,I),g)>0 such that \u03a0(g, t)(S, I) \u2208 G for all t \u2265 t\n7.There are two criteria in [23] to determine the perturbation result for a globally stable equilibrium: (i) existence of a global attractor A\ng of \u03a0(g, t): X\n1 \u2192 X\n1 for each g near the function f, (ii) for all t > 0, \u03a0(g, t)A\ng are uniformly bounded by a pre-compact set in X\n1.First, by Remark 4, for each g \u2208 B(f, \u03b50), \u03a0(g, t) is uniformly persistent with respect to (X\n1, \u2202X\n0), and then by Hale and Waltman [29, Theorem 3.2], there is a global attractor A\ng of \u03a0(g, t): X\n1 \u2192 X\n1.From the proof in Theorem 1, \u03a0(g, t)X \u2192 X is compact for all g \u2208 B(f, \u03b50) and t > 0. Then for any fixed t > 0, \u03a0( \u00b7, t)(x): B(f, \u03b50) \u2192 X is continuous uniformly for x in any bounded Y \u2282 X. By using the method in the proof of [30, Theorem 3.1] and regarding the parameter space as a functional space equipped with the previously defined norm, it shows that \u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b0)\u03a0(g,t)Y\u00af is compact in X. Let \u03c9\ng(x) be the omega limit set of x \u2208 X for \u03a0(g, t). Since \u03c9\ng(x) is invariant for \u03a0(g, t) and \u03c9\ng(x) \u2282 G, it leads to \u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b0)\u03c9g(x)\u00af\u2282\u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b0)\u03a0(g,t)\u03c9g(x)\u00af\u2282\u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b0)\u03a0(g,t)G\u00af, and then \u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b0)\u03c9g(x)\u00af is compact in X. From Lemma 1, the case gij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P and R0>1 implies a unique equilibrium (S\n0, 0) in \u2202X\n0 and \u222ax\u2208\u2202X0\u03c9g(x)={(S0,0)}. Clearly, {(S\n0, 0)} is an acyclic covering of itself. In addition, from Theorem 3 and Remark 4, there exists \u03be=\u03be(\u025b0)>0 such that for any g \u2208 B(f, \u03b50), we have limsupt\u2192+\u221e\u2225\u03a0(g,t)(x)\u2212(S0,0)\u2225\u2265\u03be, for all x \u2208 X\n1. Then, by the theorem on the uniform persistence uniform in parameters [30, Theorem 4.3 and Remark 4.2], there exist \u03b51 \u2208 (0, \u03b50] and \u03c4 > 0, such that liminft\u2192+\u221ed(\u03a0(g,t)(x),\u2202X0)\u2265\u03c4 for all x \u2208 X\n1 and g \u2208 B(f, \u03b51) with gij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P. Thus, there is a compact and positive invariant subset G\n0 of X\n1 such that A\ng \u2282 G\n0 for all g \u2208 B(f, \u03b51). Therefore, for all t > 0,\n\u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b1)Ag\u00af=\u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b1)\u03a0(g,t)Ag\u00af\u2282\u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b1)\u03a0(g,t)G0\u00af\u2282G0\u2282X1,and then \u222ag\u2208B(f,\u025b1)\u03a0(g,t)Ag\u00af is compact in X\n1.By Theorem 4, system (2.1) admits an endemic equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable in X\n1. From previous results and the perturbation theory in [23, Theorem 2.2], there exists an \u025b\u00af\u2208(0,\u025b1] such that for any g\u2208B(f,\u025b\u00af) with gij > 0 for i, j \u2208 P, the system (2.1) admits an endemic equilibrium E*(g)=(S*(g),I*(g)) which is globally asymptotically stable in X\n1. \u25a1\nRemark 4The uniform boundedness in Theorem 1 refers to the general mode (2.1). Therefore, we can consider the model with disease-induced death by regarding the death rate as a perturbed parameter and by using the same theory to show that an endemic equilibrium, if exists, is globally asymptotically stable in the system (2.1).\n",

First, taking inner-elusion in patch-1 helps inner control of disease spread, but damages the disease control in patch-2. Hence, adopting adaptive dispersal in a patchy disease model represents competition of disease control between different patches. Second, for fixed positive b\n21, the population of infectious individuals I1* in patch-1 under linearly adaptive dispersal rate, is smaller than that under the case of nonlinear adaption. Therefore, it is more efficient to control disease by adopting linearly adaptive dispersal rather than nonlinearly adaptive dispersal.

On the other hand, it also greatly reduce the total population of the patch that executes the policy. Finally, Fig. 4d reveals an interesting result that, by taking the same intensity of media coverage, the amounts of both compartments in different patches synchronize in time.",

It assumes a constant intensity, cij, of media report in each patch. In fact, there may exists complicated process leading to the outbreak of a disease, and the intensity of media varies to reflect different levels of disease spread. Here, we review the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 to see how the media report affected the strategy of dispersal between Mainland China and Taiwan, two patches which are connected mainly by airplanes, during the period of epidemic. We refer to the monthly data of the ratio of immigration among the total population reported by Department of Statistics, Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan [31]. Fig. 5\na depicts the effect of SARS on the number of immigration from Mainland China (patch-2) into Taiwan (patch-1). The dash curve represents the ratio of immigration for each month in 2002 by natural dispersal from Mainland China into Taiwan (a\n12), and the solid curve is the ratio of each month in 2003 effected by the impact of SARS. In Fig. 5b, we calculate the intensity of adaption according to the data in Fig. 5a and the mode of adaption (N) with b12=0, for focusing on the role of c\n12. According to the report of World Health Organization, the first onset of SARS in Taiwan happened at 2003 March 13, and the broad spread begun around mid-April and ended at mid-June [32]. The intensity of adaption in Fig. 5b, which reveals larger values from April to July, agrees with the period of outbreak of SARS. Therefore, the intensity of media influence varies to reflect different levels of disease spread and the dispersal rate of population between Mainland China and Taiwan does change and depend on the intensity of media report.",

By contrast, from (3.2) and (3.3), the assumption in our model on media-induced adaption effects on dispersal affects this threshold value for predicting disease outbreak. In addition to theoretically determining the convergence dynamics under certain criteria, we identified that (i) When the disease spread cannot be controlled under a natural dispersal, applying the strategy of media coverage in an endemic patch can help annihilate the disease in the connected system, whereas media coverage from a disease-free patch exacerbates disease control. (From the discussion in subsection 3.2.) (ii) When the disease is a pandemic (i.e., R0>1), increasing the intensity of media coverage can substantially reduce the number of infectious individuals at the endemic equilibrium, and reveals competition for disease control in different patches. (From Fig. 2 and 3) (iii) When R0>1, applying the strategy of media coverage results in a considerable reduction in the time for disease extinction in local patch, but substantially reduces the total population of the patch that executes the policy. (From Fig. 4) (iv) By applying the same intensity of media coverage, the amount of both compartments in different patches synchronizes over time. (From Fig. 4)",

Can it exhibit a periodic state through Hopf bifurcation? Time delay is another intrinsic characteristic in biological systems. In [33], oscillations can be induced by disease related death in a model with maturation delay. A question arises in (2.1) that if there exists an oscillation caused by the time delay from the transmission of media information. In addition, diseases without a latent period exist, and individuals move to avoid those with symptoms. In such an epidemic model, setting the dispersal rates depending on the infectious individuals instead of the total population is reasonable; in other words, replacing fij(Ni, Nj) and gij(Ni, Nj) with fij(Ii, Ij) and gij(Ii, Ij), for i, j \u2208 P in model (2.1). In this case, the basic reproduction number is then independent on the adaption mechanism, and the global dynamics of DFE (R0<1) and the persistence of disease (R0>1) can be demonstrated by the same manner in this study. However, it is expected to be difficult to deal with the global dynamics of the endemic case. Therefore, we have reserved these problems for our future study. In addition to the SIS model with contagious transmission, adaptive dispersal can be considered in other epidemic models, including noncontagious diseases such as vector-host models.",
