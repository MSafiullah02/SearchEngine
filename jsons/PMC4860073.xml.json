            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are estimated to cause 3.9 million deaths annually; many of these infections present as influenza-like illnesses (ILIs),1 which can be caused by many different respiratory viruses. In patients with asthma, respiratory viral infections lead to exacerbations, potentially placing the patient's life at risk and creating an economic burden to the patient, the health care system, and society.2 Asthma exacerbations are responsible for half the cost of the disease and for 5000 deaths in the United States every year.3 Several reviews suggest that viral infections are present in up to 50% of adult exacerbations and more than 60% of pediatric exacerbations.[4], [5], [6] It is estimated that the prevalence of asthma in Mexico is approximately 5%7; however, there are no estimates of the economic impact of an asthma exacerbation. Despite strong evidence linking viral infections to asthma exacerbations, the mechanisms by which viral infections trigger exacerbations are not fully understood.8 Despite virus-induced exacerbation being frequently cited, few studies have found this viral involvement in asthma exacerbation.[9], [10], [11] The association between viral infections and asthma exacerbations leads to questions regarding why some patients develop severe exacerbations and others do not. It is known that in hospitalized patients with ILIs, a comorbidity associated with severity is asthma. We hypothesized that certain viral infections, patterns of ILI symptoms, and laboratory values may identify patients who develop severe asthma exacerbations that require subsequent hospitalization.",

Participants were enrolled in 6 hospitals, 5 in Mexico City and 1 in the central city of San Luis Potos\u00ed. Recruitment occurred year round, and participants were enrolled in the study if they had at least 1 respiratory symptom and at least 1 of the following general symptoms: fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia, and/or chest pain. Once enrolled, participants had a baseline study visit to collect information on demographics, medical history, laboratory tests, and clinical care needed (outpatient, hospitalization, intensive care admission). Follow-up visits were performed on days 14 and 28 during which information on hospitalization, if any, was collected. This study was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution; all study procedures were performed after obtaining written patient informed consent and corresponding written assent if appropriate.",

            "text": "Although it is generally accepted that viral infections can be associated with asthma exacerbations, there is controversy about how frequently exacerbations are triggered by viral infections. Some studies report an association, particularly among children, whereas others have not found that viruses are associated with asthma exacerbation.[15], [16], [17] Multiple studies have implicated rhinovirus as an important trigger, especially among children. Rhinovirus infections were found to be associated with hospital readmissions attributed to asthma among children younger than 13 years, a frequent cause of hospital admission due to asthma among children younger than 5 years,18 and associated with asthma exacerbations among children 2 to 17 years old.[11], [19] It has also been suggested that members of the Rhinovirus family might be more virulent and/or have a greater propensity to cause exacerbation.[20], [21] Given the aforementioned studies, we suspect that we were unable to detect an association because our patient population is mainly adults; therefore, our results are most relevant to adults with asthma, and perhaps we did not find a stronger association because all participants had ILI. Our findings suggest that viral infections alone are not the only contributors to adult asthma exacerbations, and efforts should instead be made to assess other factors known to be involved in severe exacerbations. Asthma control[13], [22], [23], [24], [25] and environmental allergens26 together with viral infections are likely responsible for the risk factors for hospital admission.11\n",

Lymphocytopenia is more closely associated with viral infections.28 The presence of increased leukocytes and neutrophils may be associated with the heterogeneous inflammatory response, possibly attributable to preexisting inflammation due to asthma that might be worsened by exposure to the virus. Production of chemokines by bronchial epithelium in response to a viral infection leads to the entry of neutrophils to the respiratory airways, as confirmed on experimental and naturally induced common cold among asthmatic patients.29 Neutrophilia in the airways is associated with increased levels of elastase interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 and lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of epithelial injury, but also with bacterial exacerbations. Therefore, it is not always clear which mechanism drives the neutrophil elevation. Although these laboratory parameters are consistent with the high prevalence of viral infections among our patient population, these responses can also be seen in bacterial infections.[29], [30] Our results suggest that in patients with asthma and ILI, these laboratory tests might be useful to predict severe exacerbations, although we were not able to determine whether these increases occurred before the exacerbation and whether the patient has a viral or bacterial infection.",

However, after adjusting for age, current tobacco use, and sex, we did not find an association with exacerbations. Asthma exacerbations are closely tied to asthma control, and the evidence linking obesity to asthma controls is mixed, with studies supporting[32], [33], [34], [35], [36] and refuting an association.[37], [38], [39] A Cochrane review of weight loss interventions to improve asthma control concluded that there may be weak associations, but noted that research in this area is lacking.40 Our failure to find an association could be confounded by our inability to assess asthma control before entry into the study.

Asthma was self-reported with no information being collected on accuracy of diagnosis, prescribed medications, or adequacy of asthma symptom control. Information regarding environmental exposures was not collected beyond cigarette use and exposure or on pulmonary function. This information might have been valuable to accurately classify participants, particularly those with mild exacerbations. We also only have information on asthma symptoms on the day of recruitment, and do not have data on symptoms before or after enrollment into the study. For this reason, there may be some misclassification of exacerbation status.

Asthma patients included adults and children recruited from multiple communities in Mexico. Finally, our study confirmed previous studies conducted on virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",
