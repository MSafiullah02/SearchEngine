Initial cases in the Middle-East were reported to the World Health Organisation's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, set up to detect epidemics and other public health emergencies. Te type of virus is known, a novel coronavirus, a species of the virus behind the common cold, but its origins are still a mystery. Tis new virus is currently moving slowly, but it was a coronavirus that caused the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic which killed 774 people, so scientists who work on controlling the spread of new infections are on full alert.",
