However, more than half of the patients treated for hematologic malignancies will develop a pulmonary complication during their follow-up, infectious pneumonia remaining the most common diagnosis that should be considered fi rst in regard to its potential severity. Otherwise, new complications that may involve different organs, including the lungs, have been increasingly reported. Currently, over a quarter of lung infi ltrates occurring in the context of hematological diseases are due to noninfectious causes [ 1 ] . Thus, lung physicians may be increasingly confronted with these lung disorders. Various noninfectious pulmonary complications have been described in the different hematological malignancies; however, these complications are most often studied in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this chapter, we will briefl y review the lung diseases associated with various hematological malignancies before focusing on noninfectious pulmonary complications following allogeneic HSCT.",

            "text": "Given the wide spectrum of lung diseases that can occur in the context of hematological malignancies, the diagnostic process must be rigorous. In addition to the many pathogens potentially involved, a wide range of noninfectious causes should be considered. The pulmonary location of the hematological disorder should be considered depending on the underlying disease. Some hematological diseases, such as lymphoma, can progress in the lung, unlike others, such as myeloma, for which lung involvement is very rare. Pulmonary cardiogenic or noncardiogenic edema is frequent and can be due to hyperhydration required before chemotherapy, cardiotoxicity secondary to use of anthracyclines or increased capillary permeability from drugs such as alltrans-retinoid acid or cytosine arabinoside. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage is common in patients with thrombocytopenia or allogeneic HSCT. Many drugs frequently used for the treatment of hematological disorders may cause lung damage (Pneumotox.com); these drugs include Bleomycin, Busulfan, Chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Cytosine, Fludarabine, Rituximab, Dasatinib and others (Table 32 .1 ). Radiotherapy may cause radiation pneumonitis. Drug treatments can cause entirely different clinical patterns depending on the target organ in the respiratory system (lung, airways and pleura) [ 2 ] . Different other \"immunological\" causes of pneumonitis may occur in the course of several hematological malignancies (Table 32 .2 ). For example, sarcoid-like granulomatosis may be associated with lymphoma, eosinophilic pneumonia may occur in the course of a myelodysplastic syndrome and pulmonary graft-versus host disease (GVHD) may be a complication following allogeneic HSCT. The medical history of the patient, including the clinical history of lung involvement and the type of underlying malignancy, the lung CT scan and the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), should be used when making a diagnosis. A lung biopsy, when possible, would rule out infection and would reinforce or even confi rm a diagnostic [ 70 ] Pulmonary edema [ 70 ] Amyloidosis [ 68 , 70 ] Lung cancer [ 71 ] Myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative disorders Extramedullary hematopoiesis [ 72 ] Sweet's syndrome [ 72 ] Diffuse infi ltrative lung disease in the context of autoimmune disorders [ 72 ] Eosinophilic pneumonia [ 72 ] Alveolar proteinosis [ 72 ] Organizing pneumonia [ 72 ] Pulmonary hypertension [ 73 ] hypothesis. However, it is rarely performed in this context because it is associated with signifi cant mortality and morbidity and results in a defi nitive diagnosis in only 60 % of cases [ 3 ] . Furthermore, new biological tools including polymerase chain reaction for many pathogens and antigen for Aspergillus used on both respiratory samples and sera greatly help to diagnose an infection [ 4 ] . Finally, the overall diagnostic approach of lung infi ltrates in patients treated for a hematological malignancy must take into account the possible overlapping of different infectious and/or noninfectious causes.",

            "text": "The transplanted stem cells can be derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood harvested from a related donor or a compatible unrelated donor. Before the transplantation procedure is performed, the host is prepared with a special conditioning regimen that usually involves fractionated total body irradiation and cytotoxic chemotherapy to prevent graft rejection and to eradicate any residual tumor cells. Until recently, the conditioning regimen was \"myeloablative,\" leaving the patient severely neutropenic for several weeks. Over the past few years, nonmyeloablative transplants have been developed based on the graft-versus leukemia/lymphoma principle, thereby eradicating residual tumor cells. The conditioning regimen for these transplants is attenuated, depressing only the host immune response and thus limiting the neutropenic period to just a few days. This means that allogeneic HSCT can now be extended to older and frailer patients with comorbidities who have had longterm treatment in the past, which has increased the number of allogeneic HSCT procedures performed. The major complications that occur after allogeneic HSCT are infections or the consequences of the immune reactions of GVHD, which can be either acute or chronic depending on the clinical features [ 5 ] . For unknown reasons, unlike the skin, gastrointestinal tract and liver, the lungs have not been identifi ed as a target of acute GVHD in humans. In contrast, lung involvement is common in chronic GVHD that may be either restricted to a single organ or tissue or widespread. Chronic GVHD is characterized by tissue destruction resulting in fi brosis and is associated with a process in which donor T cells recognize peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex on antigen-presenting cells of the host. GVHD targets epithelial cells of various organs with an incidence that depends on various factors and most commonly occurs during unrelated transplantations and peripheral stem cell transplantations. Treatment of GVHD requires the maintenance or enhancement of immunosuppressive therapy. The prognosis of GVHD is primarily related to the severity of the initial response to corticosteroids. The occurrence of chronic GVHD affects the morbidity, mortality and the quality of life of patients [ 6 ] .",

The only association reported in all of the studies was the occurrence of extrathoracic chronic GVHD at the time of BO diagnosis. One objective of our ALLOPULM study was to prospectively identify the events occurring within 3 months after transplantation that are associated with the subsequent occurrence of BO. Using multivariate analysis, we showed that a history of smoking, the occurrence of pulmonary infection, and pre-existing abnormal pre-transplant pulmonary function were associated with BO development [ 17 ] .",

As opposed to acute GVHD, chronic GVHD also involves B-cell stimulation, autoantibody synthesis and systemic fi brosis [ 19 ] .

The National Institutes of Health Consensus proposed some histopathological criteria for BO based on a limited amount of original data [ 23 ] . The Pathology Working Group Report retained the presence of unequivocal dense eosinophilic scarring of the bronchioles resulting in some degree of luminal narrowing as a diagnostic (Fig. 32.1b ) . Infl ammation is common but variable and insuffi cient for diagnosis [ 23 ] . In fact, Yousem et al. and Yokoi et al. published small pathological series in allogeneic HSCT recipients with chronic GVHD and lung involvement [ 24 , 25 ] and reported different small airway abnormalities in this setting. Yousem et al. described two types of bronchiolar affections: lymphocytic bronchiolitis and cicatricial BO. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis is characterized by peribronchiolar/bronchiolar lymphocytic and plasmocellular infi ltrate. Airway infl ammation is predominantly lymphocytic and plasmocellular. Cicatricial BO is characterized by the obliteration of the airway lumen by dense fi brous tissue. The authors proposed that cicatricial BO is the late-stage of lymphocytic bronchiolitis [ 24 ] . The pathologic description of Yokoi et al. comes from eight autopsy cases. Small airway lesions varied from early infl ammatory changes to late scarring in each case. The infl ammatory lesions were usually mild and mostly lymphoplasmacytic, except in three patients with predominant neutrophilic infi ltrates. In all cases, infl ammatory and scarring stages were present simultaneously [ 25 ] . Although the gold standard for diagnosis of BO is the demonstration of bronchiolar lesions upon histological evaluation of a lung specimen, it is not current practice to obtain a lung biopsy. Transbronchial biopsies have poor sensitivity, and surgical lung biopsies are invasive and usually reserved for cases of confusing diagnosis. Thus, BO is usually diagnosed as a new fi xed airfl ow obstruction demonstrated by pulmonary function testing (PFT). BO syndrome (BOS) is diagnosed based on clinical, functional and radiological evaluation of the patient.",

However, some patients do not meet this functional criterion; despite the presence of BOS, the FEV1/FVC ratio may remain normal (>70 %). In fact, because BOS is a disease of the small airway, distal airway obstruction may lead to air trapping, thereby increasing the residual volume (RV). Consequently, the FVC declines concomitantly with the FEV1, and the FEV1/FVC ratio stays over 70 % [ 27 ] . NIH-BOS criteria include signs of air trapping, observed either by PFT (RV >120 %) or high-resolution computed tomodensitometry (HRCT) ( Table 32. 3 ). Recently, modifi cation of these guidelines has been proposed [ 18 ] . To minimize the dynamic collapse of airways during the forced expiratory maneuver, Chien et al. proposed the use of slow vital capacity (SVC) instead of FVC for the diagnosis of airway obstruction. They also suggested that patients with annual FEV1 declines >5 % (from pre-transplant PFT) be considered at high risk of developing BOS and that an annual FEV1 decline >10 % (from pre-transplant PFT) be considered a diagnostic criterion for early BOS, even for a FEV1 >75 % of the predicted value [ 18 ] . Finally, two groups of patients may be diagnosed with BOS: one with a classical obstructive ventilatory defect and one with a normal FEV1/ FVC ratio [ 18 , 27 ] . The prognoses of both patients are similar [ 27 ] . Future studies should focus on the early detection of BOS. Chien et al. found that allogeneic HSCT recipients with annual FEV1 declines >5 %, even with FEV1/FVC ratios >80 %, have higher risks of nonrelapse mortality; this suggests that early airfl ow decline can be used as an indicator of early BOS [ 28 ] . This fi nding should prompt systematic a b serial PFT after transplant, with careful attention to patients who develop airfl ow decline over time.",

To minimize the morbidity associated with this treatment, considering the low effi cacy of steroids in this setting, some authors have suggested alternative agents with antiinfl ammatory properties. The use of topical steroid treatment is supported by two retrospective studies. We reported decreases in dyspnea and improvements in FEV1 in seven patients with new-onset airfl ow obstruction treated with combined inhaled therapy (budesonide-formeterol) [ 34 ] . Bashoura et al. reported stabilization or improvement in FEV1 in 16/17 BOS patients treated 3-6 months with highdose fl uticasone [ 35 ] . A recent study suggests bronchodilator responsiveness in BOS patients [ 36 ] . This information may support the inhaled combination therapy, including a longacting bronchodilator and a corticosteroid, over an inhaled corticosteroid alone. The effi cacy of azithromycin in the treatment of BOS following allogeneic HSCT is controversial [ 37 , 38 ] . Finally, the effi cacy of montelukast as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in the treatment of chronic GVHD had been suggested in a pilot study [ 39 ] . These three agents are actually under study in BOS patients following HSCT, either alone or in combination [ 40 ] . ",

            "text": "Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) was fi rst defi ned in 1993 by an NIH expert committee as diffuse alveolar opacities following allogeneic HSCT after lower respiratory tract infection or cardiac failure was excluded. This defi nition was recently updated to include new microbiological diagnostic tools for the exclusion of infection, especially for newly described pathogens (Table 32 .4 ) [ 45 ] . Thus, this syndrome regroups different clinical entities that can be classifi ed according to the primitively attempted lung compartment: parenchyma (acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), OP, iatrogenic lung injury) or pulmonary blood vessels (engraftment syndrome, capillary leak syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage). IPS is thought to result from a variety of lung insults, including the toxic effects of HSCT conditioning regimens, immunologic cell-mediated injury, infl ammatory cytokines, and occult pulmonary infections [ 45 ] . Peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome (PERDS) occurring within 5 days of engraftment after allogeneic HSCT represents a clinical subset of IPS that should be identifi ed because of its specifi c clinical characteristics and because its responsiveness to corticosteroids can lead to a good prognosis [ 45 ] . PERDS is the result of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with or without concurrent pleural effusions in the context of a diffuse capillary leak syndrome and dysfunction of other organs, such as the liver, kidney, skin or gut [ 45 , 46 ] . The incidence of IPS may vary according to the time following allogeneic HSCT and the type of conditioning regimen, with a historical reported incidence of 3-15 % after myeloablative conditioning, which may be lower (but with a similar severity) after nonmyeloablative conditioning [ 47 ] . Although time from allogeneic HSCT is not a diagnostic criterion of this syndrome, IPS occurs early in the course of HSCT (median time: 3-7 weeks after HSCT), with a historical high mortality rate (60-80 %, depending on the study, and up to 90 % in case of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation). Proposed risk factors of IPS include total body irradiation-based myeloablative conditioning regimens, older recipient age, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia as an underlying disease and acute GVHD [ 45 ] . However, the association between IPS and acute GVHD is inconstant in humans, although a causal relationship between the two disorders has been proposed [ 45 ] .",

OP can occur in many different contexts: postinfection; following environmental, professional or toxic exposure; iatrogenically (due to medications, chemotherapy Peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome Noncardiogenic capillary leak syndrome Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or radiotherapy); or associated with connective tissue diseases, other chronic infl ammatory diseases, solid cancers, hematological malignancy, lung transplantation or allogeneic HSCT. When no specifi c cause is found, OP is referred to as cryptogenic (COP). For more clarity, the terminology \"Bronchiolitis Obliterans with Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP)\" has been progressively abandoned because the major histological process is OP, whereas bronchiolar lesions are a minor and inconstant process [ 49 ] . The change in terminology is particularly relevant in the context of allogeneic HSCT to avoid confusion with BO, for which the clinical presentation and prognosis are very different. In a case control study, Freudenberger et al. described 49 cases of biopsy-proven OP following allogeneic HSCT and compared them to control subjects from a computerized database of all patients who received an allogeneic transplant [ 7 ] . They identifi ed a strong association between OP and previous signs of acute and chronic GVHD, suggesting a causal link between both entities [ 5 , 7 ] . Other authors have also associated post-allogeneic HSCT OP with the presence of HLA B35 antigen [ 50 ] . The time from HSCT to OP onset ranged from a few days to more than 7 years, with a median time of 108 days. In 22 % of these cases, a tapering of immunosuppressive treatments preceded the respiratory signs. The clinical presentation was similar to that of COP, mimicking unresolved or subacute infectious pneumonia with unspecifi c symptoms (fever, dyspnea and cough) and physical signs (crackles). Radiological signs consisted of alveolar, nodular or interstitial opacities with a focal, multifocal or more diffuse extension that is indicative of the diagnosis when the topography of the lesions is peripheral or peribronchovascular [ 7 , 51 , 52 ] (Fig. 32.2a ) . Unlike COP, opacities were rarely migratory [ 7 ] .",

As for IPS, infection had to be ruled out to retain the diagnosis of ILD. Radiological signs of ILD were variable in extent and ranged from localized to more or less diffuse (Fig. 32. 3 ) [ 53 ] . BAL fl uid analysis typically showed lymphocytic or both lymphocytic and neutrophilic alveolitis. In some cases, BAL can show an eosinophilic alveolitis that allows the diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia [ 55 ] . Pulmonary function tests usually showed a restrictive ventilatory defect associated with an alteration in the carbon monoxide diffusion capacity. PFT could also reveal an obstructive lung disease, isolated or not, suggestive of an overlap or a continuum between ILD and BOS [ 53 ] . High-dose steroids were usually administered as the fi rstline therapy and were often associated with a reinforcement of other immunosuppressive drugs. The survival rate was estimated to be 61 % at 24 months from ILD diagnosis. The main cause of death was respiratory failure [ 53 ] . Because late fi brosis often remains inaccessible to conventional therapies, early identifi cation and treatment of ILD are essential for prognosis. For this purpose, ILD should be suspected in every atypical, subacute or unresolved case of infectious pneumonia, especially in the presence of extrathoracic chronic GVHD.",

A spectrum of pulmonary manifestations occurring in patients with a well-defi ned connective tissue disease (CTD) after allogeneic HSCT similar to idiopathic CTD has been reported [ 54 ] . Therefore, nonspecifi c interstitial pneumonia and lymphoid pneumonia have been reported in the course of Sj\u00f6gren-like disorders diagnosed on both clinical and biological characteristic features [ 54 ] . The incidence of these CTDs that may arise very late after allogeneic HSCT remains unknown, and they are most likely overlooked [ 54 ] . Several pathologic mechanisms have been proposed for these autoimmune manifestations, such as genetic predisposition, thymic defi ciency, the expression of an abnormal B-cell and/or T-cell reconstitution or donor-related pathogenic clone transfer [ 58 , 59 ] . The prognoses for these ILDs occurring in post-allogeneic HSCT connective tissue disorders are poor with very high mortality rates despite the usual administration of high dose steroids [ 54 ] . Considering therapeutic protocols similar to those used in CTD (e.g., cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or TNFR blockers) might be interesting in addition or as an alternative to the more classical steroid therapy.",
