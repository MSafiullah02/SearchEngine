Fortunately, most people who experience trauma do not develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with the prevalence rate of PTSD in the general population between 6.8 and 8.3% [2, 3]. While no demographic group is immune to risk of trauma exposure, the nature, frequency, and severity of trauma exposure vary widely across groups. Epidemiological data suggests that individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) experience trauma, including violence and victimization, at higher rates than the general population [4\u20137]. Consequently, the estimated prevalence of PTSD tends to be higher among LGBTQ individuals, with rates ranging from 1.3 to 47.6% among LGB and 17.8 to 42% among transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals [8\u201314]. Thus, when treating LGBTQ patients, screening for trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms is essential (see Table 1).",

With patient-centered care, the focus is on the specific needs and intentions of the patient and encouraging the exploration and expression of these goals during the visit while attending to patient concerns, feelings, and emotions [15]. For patients who identify as LGBTQ, this work can begin even before the patient and provider have met, through content and location of advertisements for services, waiting room signs inclusive of members of the LGBTQ community, and through use of inclusive paperwork (e.g., asking about preferred name, sexual orientation, and gender identity with all patients). Practical advice about how to approach creation of a welcoming environment is widely available [16, 17\u2022\u2022]. Beyond this, it is incumbent on providers to practice with the fundamental background knowledge and cultural insight to enable effective patient-provider communication. However, few professionals have training in the unique needs of LGBTQ patients [18], which is essential for asking informed questions, establishing collaborative treatment plans, and engaging in the shared decision-making that makes patient-centered care possible [19].",

These stressors can include systemic and institutional oppression, discrimination, and microaggression experiences that serve as persistent reminders of LGBTQ individuals\u2019 minority status [20, 23]. These external and felt social stressors, or \u201cdistal stressors,\u201d can condition LGBTQ individuals to anticipate rejection from others, experience shame, and to conceal their minority identity to prevent emotional pain, physical harm, or further trauma(s) [20, 24]. These learned adaptations, in turn, are associated with higher rates of mental and physical health complications generally [25] and can give rise to symptoms similar to each of the four main PTSD symptom clusters: intrusions, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal. That is, intrusions share overlap with the occurrence of intrusive thoughts and rumination observed among LGBTQ individuals who experience minority stress [25], and avoidance is consistent with their elevated rates of identity concealment and social withdrawal [24]. Disruptions in cognition and mood overlap with symptoms of depression, anxiety [26], and negative thoughts of self and others observed as well [27\u2022]. Hyperarousal, and hypervigilance in particular, has been observed following and in anticipation of discrimination [28]. Thus, the context of pervasive anti-LGBTQ sentiment can exacerbate and/or complicate recovery from trauma and can even mimic PTSD symptoms in the absence of a criterion A event.",

These reactions to environmental stressors can influence diagnostic symptom presentations and also reactions to acceptable and efficacious PTSD treatment for LGBTQ individuals [30]. We therefore recommend approaching treatment in a manner that takes into account and respects LGBTQ individuals\u2019 previous experiences, as well as past and present context. As such, the context of care delivery deserves some thought, with providers offering an environment that clearly signals support for the LGBTQ community. By directly confronting expectations of discrimination and addressing how minority stress and discrimination have impacted the patient\u2019s life, it becomes easier to determine the degree to which adaptations observed in treatment represent intervention targets and which are adaptive strategies to cope with minority stress.",

LGBTQ individuals may experience a reasonable distrust of the mental health profession due not only to personal experiences of discrimination in the context of help-seeking, but also due to the profession\u2019s longstanding history of labeling diversity in sexual orientation and gender identity as mental health disorders. This cultural and historical context is a critical barrier to LGBTQ individuals accessing mental health services and disclosing their sexual orientation and gender identity to providers. As such, effective treatment of trauma-exposed LGBTQ patients must acknowledge and counter these oppressive contexts [2, 3]. The creation of strong patient-provider relationships through patient-centered care practices is a first essential step towards this goal. Indeed, evidence suggests that high-quality clinician communication might buffer against disclosure apprehension in the context of previous discrimination in health care settings [33].",

In the absence of empirical guidance or established clinical guidelines, we provide preliminary treatment recommendations based on anecdotal evidence with the goal of promoting a broader discourse about the mechanisms, techniques, and assumptions that underlie, and can best advance, the treatment of PTSD among LGBTQ patients. The primary focus of this discussion is on talk therapies rather than on medications, as the former has stronger empirical support currently. The latter also offers interpersonal context in which the nuanced issues raised here can be systematically and therapeutically addressed. However, the importance of understanding the interplay between traumatic events, discrimination, minority stress, and microaggressions is essential for all treating providers, including those offering medication only.",

Specifically, PE and CPT were each derived from theoretical frameworks that assume that the lasting harms of trauma exposure are attributable to fear-based life-threat experiences and their impact on subsequent socio-cognitive and or emotional processing [47]. However, there is growing consensus that clinical distress among trauma-exposed LGBTQ individuals may stem from more than life-threat experiences. The pervasive invalidation of a patient\u2019s identity in our culture and in our health care systems, such as the pathologizing LGBTQ identities, can erode well-being due to the disruption of allostasis and ongoing allostatic load on the individual\u2019s system [48].",

For instance, Fredriksen-Goldsen and colleagues found that identity processes impacted by experiences of victimization, such as identity appraisal and identity management, moderated the relationship between marginalization and health outcomes in a sample of older LGBTQ adults [49]. Thus, the experience of trauma related to LGBTQ identity may uniquely impact how LGBTQ individuals manage identity disclosure and concealment, which in turn may shape access to social resources, mental health outcomes, and health promoting behaviors relevant to PTSD onset and course [50]. Unfortunately, trauma-focused therapies for PTSD, which focus predominantly on de-conditioning overgeneralized fear responses to environmental stimuli and remediation of cognitive distortions stemming from past trauma(s), were not developed to target such identity-related adaptations to trauma exposure.",

Counter to the typical approach of identifying overgeneralized beliefs, distorted thoughts, and exaggerated physiological responses to target in therapy, for many trauma-exposed LGBTQ individuals, these adaptations may not be exaggerated nor distorted and may serve important ongoing safety functions, such as avoiding realistic threat of future LGBTQ-based discrimination. It might be easy for a provider to mischaracterize such an accurate appraisal of realistic environmental threats as \u201chypervigilance\u201d and overlook the fact legitimate threat persists and precaution may be necessary for their patient [29\u2022\u2022, 50].

Exposure-based procedures can be used to reduce problematic emotions and beliefs that maintain avoidance and limit access to social support by providing access to events that prompt these problematic emotions while simultaneously blocking ineffective emotion-expression and action (e.g., hiding, concealment of gay identity). To facilitate new learning and effectively reduce distress, it is essential that exposures occur in contexts in which the feared or avoided outcome is unlikely to occur. The therapeutic relationship is an opportunity to offer a context where that new learning can occur in relative safety, if handled appropriately by the provider. Given a broader social context in which negative interactions are pervasive for LGBTQ individuals, clinicians must be creative and flexible about structuring exposure opportunities that promote competence and mastery outside of therapy as well. These exposures can be a part of formal PE therapy or an adjunct to medication treatments when indicated. To this end, clinicians are encouraged to develop a familiarity with LGBTQ resources, community organizations, and/or support groups in their local area. The use of imaginal-exposure in addition to in vivo exposure procedures may also be helpful and provide patients an opportunity to develop skills for tolerating difficult emotions and coping with feared outcomes in a safe and affirming environment.",

A case description of application of CPT following an anti-gay physical assault demonstrates the use of CPT to address PTSD symptoms in addition to internalized homophobia [55]. CPT entails alleviating problematic trauma-linked emotions by modifying the distorted cognitions, or stuck points that manufacture or exacerbate difficult emotions. In cases in which patient\u2019s evaluations of risk are indeed distorted, cognitive restructuring may be highly effective in alleviating suffering. However, in many cases, distressing appraisals of ongoing threats to safety, acceptance, and identity may well be reasonable and appropriate. In these cases, a shift from challenging patient\u2019s accurate appraisals of risk toward supporting the patient to identify a more affirming context is warranted. In addition, bolstering the patient\u2019s perceived ability to cope with and recover from the effects of social rejection or invalidation may be effective. In some cases, teaching or enhancing coping skills may be a direct focus of treatment.",

Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men (ESTEEM) is a transdiagnostic treatment developed to target minority stress and associated negative health consequences. ESTEEM is a 10-session treatment that enhances emotion regulation skills, reduces avoidance patterns, and improves motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change. In the initial waitlist-controlled pilot trial of ESTEEM treatment among 63 gay and bisexual men, results demonstrated improved depression, alcohol use, and sexual risk-taking outcomes for those undergoing the treatment [56]. Although this was a small-scale pilot study, ESTEEM is currently being investigated in a large multi-site trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02929069) that can potentially lead to further evidence of effectiveness and/or insight for future intervention development.",

The CBT-TSC treatment included a modified version of CPT treatment coupled with sexual risk reduction education and were compared to those receiving only HIV risk reduction and testing. Both PTSD symptoms and HIV risk-taking reduced over the course of CBT-TSC treatment relative to those in the control condition, with gains maintained through 9-month follow-up [21\u2022].

Acknowledging the important differences between intervention like ESTEEM or CBT-TSC and evidence-based PTSD treatments, we also see areas of important overlap and more importantly, opportunity for integration. In the absence of evidence-based PTSD treatments that are inclusive of minority stressors, and LGBTQ-based or minority stress-oriented treatments that extend to criterion A trauma and PTSD sequela, informal integration of these interventions might help bridge the gap while researcher work to develop and evaluate novel intervention strategies.
