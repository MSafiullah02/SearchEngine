Transmission of viral infections, including human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C are as low as one per two million blood products transfused [ 1 ] . However, other transfusion related complications persist, which can be life threatening. Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the most serious respiratory complication in transfusion medicine. Since 2003, it has been the leading cause of transfusion associated death in the USA. The Food and Drug Administration reports 43 % of transfusion related deaths due to TRALI from 2007 to 2011 [ 2 , 3 ]. Due to the high morbidity and mortality, TRALI has moved to the forefront of transfusion medicine. As a consequence, a better understanding of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and mitigation strategies in TRALI prevention has developed.",

Two key points were highlighted in the revision of the defi nition. The fi rst was emphasizing an acute and new presentation of respiratory distress. The second focus was to eliminate other temporally associated, alternative risk factors to explain the new lung injury (Table 11 .1 ). Two other terms were also defi ned-Possible TRALI and Delayed TRALI . Possible TRALI occurs when the acute respiratory distress takes place in the setting of a blood transfusion, as well as other co-existing risk factors for development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) , including: trauma, sepsis, pancreatitis, aspiration, inhalation, drug overdose, or burns. Delayed TRALI is defi ned as TRALI which occurs after 6 h but within 72 h of a blood transfusion (Table 11 .1 ). These distinctions between TRALI, possible TRALI, and delayed TRALI help to further elucidate incidence, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition by clarifying the disease for future research investigations.",

Anywhere from 65 to 90 % of reported cases are found to be immune-mediated TRALI, which occurs when leukoagglutinating antibodies from the donor blood bind to conjugate recipient antigens [ 8 ] . By defi nition, evidence of antibodies from the blood donor are present; most commonly anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies, with anti-HNA3a associated with worse clinical outcomes [ 9 , 10 ] . The second mechanism for development of TRALI is classifi ed as non-antibody mediated TRALI and stems from an antibody independent mechanism. Approximately 15 % of TRALI falls into this category, in which no antibodies are found in the donor blood product. Silliman and colleagues have described the non-antibody mediated mechanism as a two-hit model. The fi rst hit involves neutrophil priming and sequestration secondary to a preexisting condition in the recipient. In the second hit, biologic modifi ers such as lipids in the blood product activate neutrophils and lead to capillary leak in the lung endothelium [ 11 , 12 ] (see Chap. 10 ).",

However, it is evident from clinical data that the critically ill population is at the highest risk for the development of TRALI [ 13 ] . In one multicenter, prospective trial, history of liver transplant, chronic alcohol use, active tobacco use, shock, increased IL-8 levels in serum, increased peak airway pressures of >30 cm H 2 O on the ventilator, and an overall positive fl uid balance were all signifi cant risk factors for TRALI [ 14 ] . Multiple studies reveal sepsis and shock as major risk factors. Not only being critically ill, but also being on mechanical ventilation at the time of transfusion may increase risk independently. A prospective cohort study showed 33 % of patients on mechanical ventilation at the time of transfusion developed acute lung injury [ 15 ] . Multiple other studies have also shown recipient risk factors such as: major surgery within 72 h of blood transfusion, hematologic malignancy, higher APACHE II scores, and active liver disease [ 16 ] . The risk for development of TRALI also increases with the number of transfusions, as seen commonly in the trauma population where patients are receiving massive transfusions [ 13 ] . Not only critically ill patients, but cardiac and orthopedic surgery patients are also at higher risk for TRALI development [ 17 ] . The time on cardiac bypass appears to be correlated as well, with longer bypass times leading to higher risk of TRALI development [ 18 ] . Despite the multitude of recipient risk factors reported, most of which are seen in the critically ill population, TRALI is also reported in otherwise healthy individuals at the time of transfusion [ 19 ] . The development of TRALI in this healthy patient population supports the realization that the risk of TRALI is not dependent on the recipient alone.",

            "text": "All forms of blood products have been reported to cause TRALI, including: whole blood, packed red blood cells, apheresis platelets, fresh frozen plasma, cryoglobulin, intravenous immunoglobulin, granulocytes, and allogeneic stem cells [ 12 ] . However, blood products with higher plasma volume are at the greatest risk, specifically fresh frozen plasma, apheresis platelets, and whole blood. In the FDA reported cases of death due to TRALI, fresh frozen plasma was the most implicated [ 7 ] . In one retrospective cohort study from 2007, fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusions led to a higher incidence of TRALI versus red blood cell transfusion in the ICU population [ 20 ] . It remains unknown the exact amount of plasma which must be transfused in order for TRALI to develop. Reports of as little as 10-20 ml of plasma transfused before TRALI development are in the literature; however, plasma volumes greater than 50-60 ml are thought to be the threshold which puts patients at a higher risk [ 12 ] . Another important risk factor is the gender of the donor, and preventive strategies in the past 15 years have focused on gender related donor deferral . Female, multiparous donors have allo-immunization from pregnancy. Blood from this particular group of donors has a much higher risk of TRALI development in the recipient secondary to the anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies, which bind to recipient antigens and lead to immune-mediated TRALI. The prevalence of antibodies in this population increases with parity. A 26 % approximate frequency of anti-HLA antibodies exist if a female has had more than three pregnancies [ 21 ] . Another potential risk factor where studies have shown controversial data is blood product storage time. Experts in the fi eld hypothesize that longer storage times of red blood cells may lead to a higher incidence of TRALI. Experimental models in preclinical trials show a positive correlation between longer blood storage times and TRALI; however, there remains no overt clinical evidence to support the fi nding [ 22 ] . Studies done in the preemie population showed no difference in the incidence of TRALI based on blood storage time. An ongoing study in the adult intensive care unit population is underway that hopefully will help to clarify the importance of blood storage time as a potential risk factor [ 23 ] .",

It occurs in all age groups, including children and the geriatric population. It occurs at the same frequency in women and men. Reported TRALI incidence varies between 0.08 and 15 % of patients transfused and 0.01-1.12 % per product transfused, with the higher incidence in the critically ill patient population [ 24 ] . Up to 50-70 % of patients in an intensive care unit receive some form of blood product transfusion, and more independent patient risk factors exist in the critically ill population, which may account for this increase in incidence (see section \"Risk Factors\"). Even though the overall reported incidence of TRALI remains low, it is almost certainty an under-recognized and underdiagnosed condition. In the setting of no gold standard for diagnostic testing, a passive reporting system, and an array of mild cases which do not meet the consensus defi nition of the disease, TRALI remains under-reported [ 25 ] . Despite the underestimated incidence of TRALI, the overall frequency has decreased since the mid-2000s secondary to preventative strategies for plasma and platelet transfusions (see section \"Prevention\").",

Clinically, the most common complaint of patients is dyspnea. However, a large number of patients are critically ill and on mechanical ventilation at the time of blood transfusions leading symptoms to be unhelpful. Despite patients being unable to report symptoms, clinical signs of respiratory distress and failure are present, typically within one to 2 h of a blood transfusion in the majority of patients. Predominately, patients are tachypneic, and in approximately one-third of patients, fever and/or hypotension may develop. Rarely patients may develop new onset hypertension. Most notably in the vital signs, SpO2 should be decreased compared to before the transfusion. Patients on mechanical ventilation may experience a change in pulmonary compliance with an increase in peak and plateau pressures. Pink, frothy secretions from the mouth or endotracheal tube occur in roughly half of patients who develop TRALI. Physical exam should help rule out other etiologies of respiratory distress and should be thorough including a complete lung, heart, and skin exam. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles. Exam fi ndings suggestive of cardiac failure should not be present, such as jugular venous distention and an S3 on cardiac auscultation. It is important to keep in mind that very mild cases of TRALI do exist, which may not fall into the NHLBI and CCC defi nitions.

Diagnosis can be diffi cult as there is no gold standard diagnostic test for TRALI. Any person who develops even the least amount of dyspnea or respiratory distress in temporal association with a blood product transfusion should have further clinical and diagnostic evaluation for TRALI. Patients who meet the 2004 NHLBI and CCC defi nition (Table 11 .1 ) including, new hypoxemic respiratory failure with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <300 and bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates within a 6 h time frame from blood product transfusion, deserve further workup to confi rm the diagnosis. One of the goals of the diagnostic workup should be to rule out other possible etiologies for the new development of ARDS, which would then classify the patient as possible TRALI. No diagnostic lab tests are available that confi rm the diagnosis of TRALI. An arterial blood gas can be helpful to quantify the degree of hypoxemia. The most common laboratory fi nding is acute and transient leukopenia, which is thought to be secondary to neutrophil sequestration into the pulmonary vasculature and can be seen in 5-35 % of patients [ 27 ] . Thrombocytopenia has also been reported in TRALI. Other laboratory tests, although not diagnostic may also be helpful. In other etiologies of ARDS such as sepsis, a leukocytosis may be present. An elevated brain naturitic peptide can be seen in transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO) and should not be elevated in TRALI alone. As stated before, a chest X-ray revealing bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates is a ubiquitous fi nding in TRALI, and should be performed for any patient with suspicion of the diagnosis. Historically the pulmonary infi ltrates in TRALI were described as \"white out lungs.\" This may be the scenario in extreme cases; however, both alveolar and interstitial infi ltrates have been described in a spectrum from bilateral and patchy to diffuse territories of the lung fi elds. Despite the fi ndings being nonspecifi c, the presence of bilateral infi ltrates should reach 100 % in this patient population. The chest X-ray is also helpful to eliminate other etiologies of acute respiratory failure, such as pneumothorax .",

Since no gold standard diagnostic test exist for TRALI, and it occurs most commonly in the critically ill population with multiple other comorbidities, possible TRALI remains a very relevant diagnosis. If any of these other conditions exist or are suspected, a defi nitive diagnosis of TRALI cannot be made. Further diagnostic workup should be done in order to eliminate the additional etiologies.

Each blood transfusion reaction is managed differently, therefore it is vital to establish the correct diagnosis. The transfusion reaction that mimics TRALI the most is TACO (see Chap. 12 ). TACO may coexist with TRALI and distinguishing between these two diagnoses may be diffi cult (Table 11 .3 ). Both conditions present acutely during or after blood product transfusion. Also, both lead to acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia with bilateral infi ltrates on chest X-ray. While TRALI's clinical presentation stems from non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema with capillary leak, TACO is secondary to hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The two conditions are both transient but managed differently. Diuretics are the mainstay of treatment for TACO, but may be detrimental in the treatment of TRALI (see section \"Medications\"). A positive fl uid balance is a risk factor for development of TRALI, and if the positive fl uid balance is secondary to compromised cardiac function a higher awareness for TACO should exist. While no defi nitive test exists to distinguish between the two, diagnostic tools such as elevated jugular venous pressure, an S3 on cardiac auscultation, a transthoracic echo showing depressed cardiac function, and/or an elevated BNP may suggest TACO vs. TRALI. If the patient has a pulmonary artery catheter in place, an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and/or central venous pressure also favors the diagnosis of TACO.

An observational study, Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study (LAPS) looked at antibody levels in 8000 volunteers for blood donation using fl ow cytometry. Only 1-2 % of anti-HLA and anti-HNA antibodies were present in the male, never-pregnant female, and prior blood product recipient populations compared to multiparous female donors with approximately 24 % of antibodies present [ 40 ] . Other studies report higher frequency of antibodies in the multiparous, female population as well, putting patients who receive blood products from this population at an increased risk for immune-mediated TRALI [ 10 , 41 ] . In 2007 the AABB published the recommendation, \"\u2026blood collecting facilities should implement interventions to minimize the preparation of high plasma-volume components from donors known to be leukocyte-allo-immunized or who are at increased risk of leukocyte alloimmunization .\" Based on this recommendation, the deferral of multiparous, female donors from plasma donations was implicated. The policy to use solely male donors for plasma donation led to a two-thirds decreased incidence in TRALI [ 24 ] . Data also shows since the deferral of multiparous females from plasma donation, the reported cases of deaths to the FDA from plasma associated TRALI decreased from 48 % before 2007 to 27 % from 2008 to 2011 [ 42 ] . The multiparous, female donor deferral strategy also has been used in platelet apheresis donation; however, with the shortage of donors available to meet the demanding needs of platelets, it is not completely feasible to implement complete deferral of high risk donors.",
