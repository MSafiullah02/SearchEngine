            "text": "Most cases of pharyngitis are caused by viruses (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV). GAS is the most common bacterial cause and requires treatment with antibiotics; therefore, the main objective in evaluating a patient in the primary care setting is to identify, rule out, and treat GAS. Many clinicians use the \u201cCentor Criteria,\u201d which include fever, tonsillar exudate, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough. All adult patients with pharyngitis should be clinically screened using these criteria. Patients with none or one of these criteria should not be cultured or treated with antibiotics. Patients with 2 or more of these criteria should have their throat cultured for GAS, and antibiotics should be reserved for those with positive results. Patients with 3 or 4 of these criteria should be treated with antibiotics without the need for throat culture results.",

The indications for a chest X-ray in patients with an acute cough to rule out pneumonia are patients with abnormal vital signs (increased respiratory rate, difficulty in respiratory effort, stridor or tachypnea, and oxygen saturations below 92%) or crackles on chest examination.

If the patient has recently traveled out of the country where the water may be contaminated, consider E coli or Giardia.
