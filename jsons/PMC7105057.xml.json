            "text": "Viral respiratory infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Paramyxoviruses are the most common respiratory pathogens in children. In particular, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly all children within the first two years of life [1], resulting in more than 120,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Because immunity after the first infection is not complete, RSV is also a common cause of respiratory morbidity in older children and adults and mortality in the elderly. In addition to the acute care costs, a common sequela of early-life RSV infection is the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma [2]. A new paramyxovirus genetically related to RSV, the human metapneumovirus (hMPV), has been discovered recently and characterized as a frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infections [3]. Other common viral respiratory pathogens include influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses. Given the considerable public health burden, it is important to develop relevant disease models using in vitro, in vivo and in silico techniques to better understand the acute and chronic effects of viral infection on the respiratory tract.",

A comprehensive and unbiased analysis of viral prevalence in a given biological setting is facilitated by 70 mer oligonucleotide DNA microarrays capable of detecting hundreds of viruses simultaneously. Viral serotypes can be distinguished by the unique hybridization pattern generated by each virus. Furthermore, combining random PCR amplification with microarray analysis multiple viruses can be detected in human respiratory specimens without the use of sequence-specific probes. This expands the spectrum of detectable viruses in a single assay, whereas simultaneously providing the capability to discriminate among viral subtypes.",

This study illustrates the development and validation of an oligonucleotide re-sequencing array for the entire 30-kb SARS-CoV genome which is both rapid and cost effective. Through the study of SARS-CoV mutation patterns, tracing index cases and contacts in human populations is made much easier. Thus, this DNA microarray methodology is ideal for global epidemiologic monitoring of SARS-CoV and other small-genome pathogens, and has also been used as a complementary technique for typing and sub-typing influenza viruses, which could lead to more effective tracking of flu epidemics [15].",

A major advantage of mouse models has been the wide availability of reagents and specific antibodies for the study of immuno-inflammatory and signal transduction pathways. More importantly, targeted deletion or over-expression of specific genes, which is typically conducted in mice, has been instrumental in understanding the molecular basis of virus\u2013host interactions. By contrast, the small size of litters limits the use of this model for studies of early-life infections, especially when physiologic measurements are involved.

We developed a model of RSV bronchiolitis in F344 rat [20], which is unique in that this strain mounts a strong immune response and clear RSV from the lungs, much like the self-limiting disease process that occurs in normal, immunocompetent children. By contrast, guinea pigs [21] and mice [22] are unable to clear this virus even after several months, developing practically life-long infections that are highly unusual in humans.

Stronger inflammatory responses developing in the lower respiratory tract early in life might explain why RSV bronchiolitis tends to occur in infants, whereas this infection tends to be restricted to the upper respiratory tract infection in older children and adults.

An excellent example is palivizumab (Fig. 2\n), a humanized monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion protein, which prevents spreading of the infection to the lower respiratory tract and is currently used worldwide for the passive prophylaxis of RSV disease in high-risk infants. The neutralizing activity of this antibody was titrated in cotton rats [26], and its protective effects against RSV-induced acute airway inflammation [27], chronic hyperreactivity [28], and apnea [29] were shown in F344 rats (Fig. 3\n). The same models are currently being used to test new generation, more potent anti-RSV antibodies [30]. Also, monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein were prepared recently by immunizing mice [31].",
