We present evidence that nsp1 uses a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation and gene expression. Nsp1 bound to the 40S ribosomal subunit and inactivated the translational activity of the 40S subunits. Furthermore, the nsp1-40S ribosome complex induced the modification of the 5\u2032 region of capped mRNA template and rendered the template RNA translationally incompetent. Nsp1 also induced RNA cleavage in templates carrying the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus, but not in those carrying IRES elements from hepatitis C or cricket paralysis viruses, demonstrating that the nsp1-induced RNA modification was template-dependent. We speculate that the mRNAs that underwent the nsp1-mediated modification are marked for rapid turnover by the host RNA degradation machinery.",

            "text": "a r t i c l e s Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the causative agent of a newly emerged disease, SARS, is an enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of about 29.7 kb 1 . Upon infection, genome expression begins with the translation of gene 1, which constitutes the 5\u2032-end two-thirds of the viral genome, to produce two large precursor polyproteins 2,3 that are proteolytically processed by two virally encoded proteinases to generate 16 mature proteins, namely nsp1 to nsp16 (ref. 2) . Although most of these gene-1 proteins are essential for viral RNA synthesis, some of them seem to have other biological functions 4-7 . The most N-terminal gene-1 protein, nsp1, has interesting biological functions; expressed SCoV nsp1 induces host mRNA degradation and suppresses host translation 8 . The expressed nsp1 suppresses the host antiviral signaling pathways as well 9 . Furthermore, nsp1 suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon (IFN) production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and host translation suppression in infected cells 10 . The nsp1 of a closely related mouse hepatitis virus also suppresses host gene expression and is a viral virulence factor 11 . These data suggest that the SCoV nsp1-mediated suppression of host genes is important in the pathogenesis of SARS. Accordingly, a delineation of the mechanisms of the nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression is important for providing insight into SCoV pathogenesis at the molecular level. We designed the present study to uncover the mechanism of nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression primarily by using an in vitro system. Our data revealed that nsp1 uses a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation and gene expression.",

After incubation of the nsp1 protein with RRL at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, we added different concentrations of capped and polyadenylated Renilla luciferase mRNA transcripts (rLuc RNA) to the mixture and incubated the samples in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine for 30 min. In control samples in which rLuc RNA was incubated with GST and nsp1-mt proteins, rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein abundance increased with rising mRNA concentrations. In contrast, the rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein abundance in the nsp1-containing sample were substantially lower than in the control samples; the rLuc activity and the radiolabeled rLuc protein abundance in the presence of nsp1 were about 6%-8% of the levels observed with GST or nsp1-mt (Fig. 1a,b) , which clearly demonstrates that nsp1 efficiently inhibited the rLuc protein synthesis from capped rLuc RNA in RRL.",

We transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with mRNAs encoding nsp1, nsp1-mt or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) proteins; all of these encoded proteins carried a C-terminal myc-His tag. At 8 h after transfection, we prepared the cell extracts and performed polysome profile analysis (Fig. 2a-c) . Expression of CAT and nsp1-mt yielded similar polysome profiles, whereas nsp1 expression resulted in the accumulation of 80S monosomes, along with a substantial reduction in the polysome abundance, in accordance with the observation that the expressed nsp1, but not nsp1-mt, suppresses host translation 10 . Western blot analysis of the resolved gradient fractions showed that the majority of nsp1, but not CAT and nsp1-mt, sedimented with the 40S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 2b) . Likewise, only nsp1 sedimented with the 40S ribosomal sub-unit in RRL (Fig. 2d-f) . To confirm the interaction of nsp1 with the 40S ribosomal subunit, we transfected 293 cells with in vitro-synthesized mRNAs encoding nsp1-myc-His fusion protein, CAT-myc-His protein or nsp1-mt-myc-His protein and immunoprecipitated the cell extracts with antibody to myc (anti-myc). The immune complexes were washed with 0.5 M KCl, a stringent, highsalt condition in which the 60S ribo-somal subunits and the translation initiation factors dissociate from the 40S subunits 14 . Consistent with our previous report 10 , the expression of nsp1 was substantially lower than that of nsp1-mt or CAT. Nevertheless, an efficient immunoprecipitation of 18S ribosomal RNA and S6 ribosomal protein, core components of the 40S subunit, with nsp1, but not with CAT and nsp1-mt ( Fig. 2g-i) , suggested the tight association of nsp1 with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Similarly, coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that nsp1 also interacted with the 40S ribosomal subunit in RRL (Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

To test the effect of nsp1 on 48S complex formation, in which the 43S complex binds to the mRNA, and 80S monosome assembly, we examined, by sucrose gradient fractionation, the accumulation of these complexes on a radiolabeled mRNA template in the presence of nsp1. To analyze the effect of nsp1 on 80S formation, we incubated 32 P-labeled rLuc RNA template with nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt in RRL in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). CHX treatment inhibits the elongation step, but does not affect 80S monosome assembly 15 . We used hippuristanol, which blocks the function of initiation factor eIF4A and inhibits 48S complex formation, as a control 16 . CHX treatment induced 80S complex accumulation, and hippuristanol inhibited it (Fig. 3a) . Nsp1, but not GST and nsp1-mt, suppressed 80S complex formation (Fig. 3b) . We tested the effect of nsp1 on 48S complex formation by incubating the samples with GMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, and subsequently subjecting them to sucrose gradient centrifugation; GMP-PNP does not affect 48S complex formation, whereas it blocks GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 in eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA complexes and inhibits the release of eIF2 and subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit 17 . The 48S complex accumulated in the presence of GMP-PNP, but not in the presence of hippuristanol (Fig. 3c) . Nsp1, nsp1-mt and GST did not suppress the 48S complex formation (Fig. 3d) .

After initial incubation of RRL with nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt in the presence of CHX or a mixture of CHX and GMP-PNP, we added rLuc RNA that had been preannealed with a 5\u2032-end-labeled primer to the samples. Subsequently, we subjected the samples to primer extension without extracting the RNAs. In control groups, using GST and nsp1-mt, we detected a correctly positioned toeprint (TP-AUG), a premature primer extension termination signal that was induced by the presence of the stalled 40S subunit. The toeprint was ~15-17 nt downstream from the translation initiation codon in the presence of GMP-PNP and CHX, which allow 48S complex formation but not 60S joining (Fig. 4a) . In the presence of CHX, the control groups showed an extra band approximately 3 nt downstream from TP-AUG, which was most probably generated by the joining of the 60S subunits to the 40S complex positioned at the AUG codon (Fig. 4a) . Consistent with the observation that nsp1 suppressed the 80S complex formation (Fig. 3b ), nsp1 caused a clear reduction in the amount of the toeprint for the 80S complex ( Fig. 4a) . Compared to the observations in the control groups, the intensity of the TP-AUG band was also lower in the sample containing nsp1 (Fig. 4a) , which suggests that nsp1 impaired start-codon recognition. Unexpectedly, we detected several more bands, both upstream and downstream of the TP-AUG, in the sample incubated with nsp1, but not in controls; a longer exposure of the CHX-treated sample clearly showed the same signals (data not shown). These data suggest that nsp1 induced the modification of rLuc RNA at several discrete sites, which blocked cDNA elongation on these modified RNAs.",

These data suggest that, in addition to modifying template RNA, the association of nsp1 with 40S ribosomal subunit also inactivated the translational function of 40S ribosomes. To further examine this possibility, we subjected Ren-CrPV-FF RNA to in vitro translation in RRL in the presence of nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt. After incubation, we analyzed aliquots of the samples by SDS-PAGE. As expected, nsp1, but not GST or nsp1-mt, suppressed both cap-dependent and IRES-dependent translation (Fig. 8a) . We added the same amount of the CAT RNA to the remaining samples, extracted RNAs and performed a second in vitro translation analysis without adding nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt (Fig. 8a,b) . The cap-dependent rLuc gene translation, from Ren-CrPV-FF RNA that was exposed to nsp1 in the first in vitro translation reaction, was inhibited, but the IRES-mediated fLuc gene translation was not inhibited. Thus, nsp1 suppressed CrPV IRES-mediated translation in the first in vitro translation reaction but did not induce the modification that inactivated the translational activity of CrPV IRES in the second in vitro translation assay. As with cap-labeled rLuc RNA (Fig. 5) , incubation of cap-labeled Ren-CrPV-FF RNA with nsp1 resulted in the removal of the 5\u2032 region from this RNA (Fig. 8c) . We interpreted these results to mean that binding of nsp1 to 40S ribosomal subunits inactivated the translational functions of 40S ribosomes, leading to the inhibition of CrPV IRES-driven translation of Ren-CrPV-FF. Collectively, these data show that nsp1 suppressed translation by inactivating the translational functions of 40S ribosomal subunits and modifying the template RNA. 30 . Unlike vhs, SCoV nsp1 has similarity in sequence and structure with no known proteins. The biological activities of SCoV nsp1 also substantially differed from those of vhs, as nsp1 inactivated the translational functions of the 40S ribosomal subunit and modified RNA transcripts only in the context of its association with the 40S subunit. The strategy that SCoV nsp1 has evolved to bind to 40S subunits to exert its function seems to be an excellent one for blocking translation of both capped mRNAs and IRES-containing mRNAs, and for efficiently accessing host mRNAs, including those involved in host innate immune functions, and inactivating them. By binding to the 40S ribosomal subunits and inactivating them, SCoV nsp1 efficiently suppressed cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation, including translation mediated by CrPV IRES. In contrast to SCoV nsp1, CrPV IRES-mediated translation is relatively insensitive to Drosophila Reaper, a potent apoptosis inducer, which also inhibits translation by binding directly to the 40S subunit 31 .",

Using rLuc RNA as a template, we showed that the formation of the 80S complex, but not the 48S complex, was inhibited in the presence of nsp1. Because the nsp1-40S complex also modified the 5\u2032 region of the rLuc RNA, it is possible that the nsp1-mediated RNA modification affected the formation of 48S and/or 80S complexes on these modified RNA templates (Fig. 3) . We obtained somewhat conflicting results, which showed that nsp1 did not suppress the 48S assembly on rLuc RNA (Fig. 3d) but that the 48S TP-AUG signal was reduced in the presence of nsp1 (Fig. 4a) . These data may imply that some of the multiple toeprints upstream of the TP-AUG, observed in nsp1-treated sample, represent arrested 48S translation intermediates as a result of nsp1 inactivating the function of 40S ribosomal subunit, leading to inefficient start site recognition; these arrested 48S translation intermediates could contribute to the signal observed for 48S complex formation (Fig. 3d) . Furthermore, the nsp1-induced RNA modification alone cannot fully account for the substantially reduced luciferase protein synthesis from capped rLuc RNA (Fig. 1) , highlighting the contribution of the translation inhibition function of nsp1 to the suppression of reporter protein expression in RRL. To clarify the exact step in the translation of capped mRNAs that nsp1 inhibits, it would be useful to isolate an nsp1 mutant that retains the 40S subunit inactivating function but lacks the RNA modification function and test the effect of this mutant on formation of 48S and 80S complexes.",

Nsp1 induced a substantial reduction in the amount of full-length cap-labeled rLuc RNA (Fig. 5a) , which suggested that the very 5\u2032 end of the rLuc RNA, including the 7-methylguanosine cap and the radiolabeled phosphate group, may have been removed. Primer extension analysis of the rLuc RNA that had been incubated with nsp1 ( Fig. 4b) revealed that nsp1 caused the modification of several different regions at the 5\u2032 end of rLuc RNA. An RNA signal that migrated slightly faster than the full-length rLuc RNA was detected after incubation of the 3\u2032-end labeled rLuc in the presence of nsp1 (Fig. 5a) . Analysis of the nsp1-treated non-polyadenylated rLuc RNA further showed that the fastmigrating species of rLuc RNA shown in Fig. 5a consisted of at least two bands that were roughly 20 to 40 nt shorter than the full-length rLuc RNA template (Supplementary Fig. 3) . These data point to a possibility that the several premature primer extension termination products, which were obtained using nsp1-treated rLuc RNA (Fig. 4b) , were derived from rLuc RNA species lacking different regions from their 5\u2032 ends. Because nsp1 induced an internal RNA cleavage in Ren-EMCV-FF (Fig. 6) , we suspect that nsp1 also triggered a similar endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in the 5\u2032 region of rLuc RNA. We also noted that the amounts of the full-length primer extension product obtained from rLuc RNA that had been incubated with nsp1 were not substantially different from the corresponding signal obtained from the control group (Fig. 4b) . These data imply that nsp1 induced the removal of the entire or a portion of the cap structure without affecting the first 5\u2032-end nucleotide from the full-length rLuc RNA. Probably the putative nsp1-induced endonucleolytic cleavage and decapping activities both contributed to the translational inactivation of nsp1-treated rLuc RNA.",

One is that the activated nsp1, induced by the binding of nsp1 to the 40S subunits, modifies these RNAs. Another possibility is that binding of nsp1 to the 40S subunits induces the activation or recruitment of a host factor(s) that modifies the template RNAs. It is also possible that some ribosomeassociated factors are involved in nsp1-induced RNA modification. Indeed, host endonucleases can destabilize host mRNAs during translational elongation in polysomes 33, 34 .

Like many host mRNAs, coronavirus mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated 37 . Several mechanisms are conceivable for an apparent selective immunity of SCoV gene expression to the nsp1-induced translational suppression. One is that the SCoV-specific translation occurs in selected subcellular compartments, where the localization and the access of nsp1 is limited. Another possibility is that viral or host-derived protein(s) selectively bind to SCoV mRNAs and facilitate SCoV-specific translation in the presence of nsp1. Alternatively, the efficient accumulation of SCoV mRNAs outcompetes the nsp1-induced translational suppression.",
