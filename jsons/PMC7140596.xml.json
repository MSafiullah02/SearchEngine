Children are often in close physical proximity at school, have less-than-perfect hygiene behaviours and have low prior immunity to many infections [1]. For this reason, school closures are often proposed as one way of delaying the spread of infection [2]. There is evidence to suggest that social contacts should reduce when schools are closed. For example, it has been reported that students have contact with fewer people during weekends [3] and that the number of contacts children have with others approximately halves during the holidays [4,5]. Several studies have also examined illness transmission rates during planned school closures, reporting a reduction in illness during school holidays [6-8] and teacher strikes [9].",

But they can also have an impact on the healthcare system, on the wider economy if large numbers of the workforce stay home to look after their children, on household incomes, on social policies implemented at school and on the likelihood of children engaging in other risky behaviours if they must be left unattended at home [10*]. Indeed, the secondary economic and social effects of school closures are potentially very large [11].",

One of the key unknowns is what happens to children after a school is closed. The optimum answer from an epidemiological perspective is that children remain in their homes for the duration of the closure, never coming into contact with another person [12,13]. However, this is impractical and from front-line experience of outbreak management, there are many accounts of children continuing to congregate after being sent home from school and sometimes engaging in behaviour likely to increase the risks of infection spreading [14,15]. Any full assessment of the impact of school closures should take this into account.",

However, social contact was still common: all 19 studies showed that at least some children took part in activities outside of the home during school closures, even despite health recommendations to remain indoors and isolated from others. In fact, eight studies [17,20,21,23,24,27,28,32] showed that the majority of children (i.e. more than 50%) left the home or took part in activities involving non-household members, including the UK study of school closures during the H1N1 outbreak which found that 98% of children left their homes during that time [17].",

For example, in a study of 233 Australian households (children with a median age of 11 years), Effler et al. [20] reported a statistically significant difference for the proportion of cases, i.e. students testing positive for influenza A(H1N1) virus, students who had been in close physical proximity to cases, and peers who did not meet case or contact criteria who reported leaving the home more than once during the closure period (42%, 66% and 92%, respectively) (p < 0.0001). Cases reported an average of 0.8 out-of-home activities per student per week, compared with 2.9 for contacts and 5.6 for peers. Other studies reported that children who reported illness or lived in households in which influenza-like illness was reported did not participate in the majority of activities reported by other students [21,22] and that their contact with others was reduced [17].",

The main reasons for agreeing with school closures were believing that it would protect the health of the community, the children themselves and the household. Another main reason was believing that there were too many sick children for the school to remain open [20,23,26,30]. Timperio et al. [30] found that over 90% of parents from 262 households in the US felt it was important to disinfect the schools while closed to reduce the community spread of influenza.",

We should not be surprised at this. Even for adults, self-isolation can be difficult [35] and stressful [36], and children often have wider social circles and feel more social pressure to interact. The precise extent to which contact patterns change during a closure is harder to determine. Only a limited number of studies have attempted to quantify this, reporting reductions in the number of contacts from 70.3 on typical school days to 24.8 [17] and 14.2 to 6.5 [18] during closures. The difference in rates reported are likely because of social and cultural differences as well as differences in definitions of a \u2018contact\u2019 between the papers: there appear to be various definitions of \u2018social contacts\u2019 in addition to what vicinity and duration are necessary for an encounter to be considered a \u2018contact\u2019.",

Ensuring parents understand why school closure is important will be a key factor determining the success of the measure in any future disease outbreak. In this regard, it was concerning that two studies appeared to highlight a lack of clarity in terms of advice about whether children could take part in social activities and knowing what children were and were not advised to do [30,32]. Advice from schools should be consistent with public health advice; hosting extra-curricular activities and sporting events during a closure sends mixed messages to parents and can be confusing or detrimental [14].",

            "text": "In terms of how our findings fit with the wider literature, one particular discrepancy is worth noting. Evidence from studies in which people are asked how they would react to a hypothetical school closure often find that parents believe they would co-operate with public health advice. For example, one study involving a hypothetical scenario of schools closing for 3 months because of an influenza pandemic found that 85% of parents responsible for children aged between 5 and 17 years of age believed they would be able to keep their children from taking public transport, going to public events and gathering outside the home during this lengthy school closure period [39]. Meanwhile, another found that 96.7% of parents claimed they would keep their children away from others for a month if schools and child-care facilities were closed [40]. Despite these good intentions, our review of real school closures suggests parents are less likely to achieve this, even when schools are closed for much shorter periods of time. Regardless of the conviction with which people answer questions about their likely future actions, much caution is needed in using such data to assume likely behaviours or make decisions about social distancing measures. The duration of planned closure of schools is likely to be important here too; short closures of up to a couple of weeks may be manageable by parents as seen in the studies reviewed but longer closures required for curtailing pandemic waves of the order of months may provide more challenge to them.",

            "text": "In terms of limitations for this review, the generalisability of the individual studies we identified is unclear. Notably, much may depend on the cultural context, perceptions of the illness in question, length of the closure, socioeconomic status of the families that are affected and information or instructions that are given to them by public health authorities. With relatively few studies in this field, it is difficult to disentangle these effects. The majority of studies examined school closures because of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and behaviours during this period may not necessarily reflect behaviours during closures for other reasons or even other infectious diseases. Additionally, several studies looked at school closures because of influenza-like illnesses, which may be considered to be mild and not too dangerous in children [41]. Behaviour during closures for this reason may be different to behaviour during closures for diseases perceived as more severe. It must also be noted that the majority of included studies were from the US, perhaps because of our decision to limit the review to English or Italian papers, and thus may not be generalisable to other cultures or countries. Future reviews should consider including papers published in other languages. While we extracted the duration of school closure from studies included in the review (Table), we did not formally analyse whether the length of school closure was associated with children\u2019s activities and contacts made outside the home. The closures we identified lasted for less than 2 weeks, limiting our ability to draw conclusions on this. However, we note that practical issues, including difficulties with childcare and economic impact, were identified by several studies. It seems plausible that longer closures would increase these difficulties. Also, while ideally this review would have calculated a mean reduction in contacts based on all studies or an overall percentage of children who left the home across all studies, this kind of calculation was not possible because of the differences in the way studies measured contacts, the time over which they were measured and the different ways of reporting this information.",

However, there were some notable limitations to the literature reviewed. Most were convenience samples, often with low response rates, so may not be representative of all households in the wider community [21,28]. It is likely that particularly vulnerable households would experience greater difficulties and would not have prioritised participating in research studies. Because of this, such groups may not be well-represented in the data. Other limitations included different data collection time points, e.g. collecting data for some participants a week after the closure and others 3 months later [28]; comparing fully-closed schools with partially-closed schools, e.g. schools where only some classes were told to remain at home and extra-curricular activities remained open [20]; and potential under-estimation of social contacts because of only asking about specific planned activities and not incidental activities [22].",

Indeed, planned school holidays may be a fair proxy for short-term closures for some parents but we cannot be sure that this can be extrapolated to longer-term closures, e.g. schools potentially closed for months. Human behaviour is complex and understanding how people respond to an evolving and urgent policy is essential. Basing policy on historical patterns may give false confidence in results and not capture uncertainty adequately. Recent reviews of the incorporation of human behaviour into infectious disease models have advocated the use of appropriate, detailed, real-world behavioural data within infectious disease modelling [44,45]. We hope that our identification of real-world data concerning social contact and mixing behaviour during unexpected school closures will help improve existing models and promote rigorous quantitative research in this area.",
