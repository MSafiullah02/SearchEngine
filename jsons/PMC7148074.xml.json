            "text": "Medical errors are a pervasive problem in healthcare that can result in serious patient harm [11]. To identify and reduce the occurrence of preventable errors, many medical centers use reporting systems to document cases. Initial reports are often reviewed and revised by more experienced physicians. The revisions could be due to stylistic reasons or (more importantly) misinterpretations/errors in the initial report. In such cases, to prevent recurrence of the errors, is crucial to identify reports with substantive differences between the original and final report and discuss them with the clinician who wrote the initial report. It is often challenging to manually identify such cases among the large number of daily written reports in a timely manner. In this work, we propose an approach for ranking revisions of medical reports by the degree of discrepancy between the different versions of the report. This allows medical practitioners to easily find the reports in which they made an error, which helps them learn from their mistakes and prevent future similar errors.",

See Fig. 1 for an example of significant and non-significant discrepancies from radiology reports. As we can see, differences between the significant and non-significant discrepancies are often not trivial to identify and requires more than just comparing surface word changes in the versions of the reports. Furthermore, significant discrepancies can occur relatively frequently in practice; in our dataset collected from a large urban hospital, around 7% of reports contained significant errors. With hundreds of reports generated a week at some hospitals, this can amount to a considerable number of errors. We address this problem by proposing a supervised ranking approach for clinician\u2019s revised reports by the degree that there are significant discrepancies between their preliminary report and the final corrected report. I.e., our goal is to rank revisions that are more likely due to errors higher than revisions that are merely due to stylistic changes.\n",

We observe that the central challenge of this task is being permissive of surface-level changes (which may be considerable), while emphasizing changes of substance, which may be subtle (see Fig. 1 for examples of such changes). To address this, we incorporate importance and similarity scores. The importance score weights each term/phrase and is learned during training. This score allows for terms that are not important to have less of an impact on the ranking score of the report (e.g., words like well and but). Note that this is a special application in which some function words that are often ignored actually have a big impact on the meaning of a report (e.g., not is often considered a stop word and removed). We let the model learn which terms are important during training. The matching score allows for the model to account for the replacement of similar terms using the cosine distance of word vectors (e.g., averaging and averages are similar) and synonym information from a domain-specific ontology (chauffeur fracture and Hutchinson fracture are synonymous). This allows the replacement of semantically-similar terms to have little impact on the ranking score. We calculate three similarity scores (addition, deletion, and overlap) using the importance and matching scores, and linearly combine them as a ranking score.",

The labels are 0 (attending doctor fully agrees with assessment of the resident, 81% of reports), 1 (errors exist, but they are insignificant to the overall impression, 12%), 2 (subtle, yet important, error exists, 6%), 3 (an obvious error exists, 1%). We split the dataset into 122 sets based on the combination of resident and week (ranking sets, average 27.6 reports per ranking set, min 5, max 148). Since residents often work weekly shifts, this is a valuable setting because it allows residents to review report discrepancies from the past week. We randomly split the ranking sets into 60-20-20 train-dev-test set splits. Each ranking set consists of at least 5 reports, each with at least one report discrepancy.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the model, we compare with the variety of methods in the state-of-the-art, including ranking models, domain specific models and textual similarity models, briefly described below:Vector space model (VSM). We use the traditional TFIDF-weighted vector space similarity score between the preliminary and final report (from lucene).BiPACRR. We test the PACRR [6] neural IR model because it learns to identify n-gram similarity between two texts. We modify the architecture to learn two scores (one with the preliminary report as the query and the other with the final report as the query), and linearly combine them to produce a final ranking score. We call this variant BiPACRR. We also experimented with other neural rankers (e.g., KNRM [20]), but BiPACRR was the most effective.Textual similarity regression (SimReg) [2]. This approach uses logistic regression to combine several hand-crafted features (mostly consisting of textual similarity measures and lexical features) to identify significant discrepancies in radiology reports. Since this approach performs classification, we use the label score as the ranking score. Our experiments used the authors\u2019 implementation.(Sci)BERT classification. We use the standard fine-tuned BERT textual similarity method on both the pretrained BERT [4] (base-uncased) and SciBERT [1] (scivocab-uncased) models.
