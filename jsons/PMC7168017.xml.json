In view of the clinical symptoms, the disease was initially referred to as \u2018atypical pneumonia\u2019 (AP). This disease has resulted in a severe epidemic outbreak in 27 countries and regions and it has been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) 1, 2, 3. Medical workers are at high risk of the disease. In this paper, we report the clinical pathology of three patients who died of SARS in Nan Fang Hospital, Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China in early 2003.",

There was desquamative alveolitis and bronchitis, with proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells (CK, EMA positive) (Figure 2), exudation of mononuclear cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells (CD68, LCA positive) (Figure 3), and alveolar oedema. The desquamated epithelial cells were clearly enlarged and some had undergone fusion to form syncytia. There were extensive hyaline membranes in alveoli (Figure 4). Focal necrosis with infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes was present in all three cases. Intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies were seen in some alveolar epithelial cells. These were spherical, about the size of an erythrocyte, and acidophilic. They were surrounded by a hyaline halo (Figure 5) and were positive with Macchiavello's stain. Desquamation of bronchial epithelial cells was present and there was necrosis of some bronchial walls with infiltration of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. The capillaries in interlobular septa and alveolar walls were dilated and congested. Most alveolar walls were not expanded (Figure 6A), but infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes was present in a few widened alveolar walls and interlobular septa. In one case (A3), the alveolar exudates were organized and fibrosed (Figures 6B and 6C), while in the other two cases (A2 and A3), mononuclear and multinucleate giant cells were seen in alveoli (Figures 7A\u20137C. The endothelial cells of small pulmonary veins were swollen and shed. Oedema was present in the walls of small veins and some veins showed fibrinoid necrosis with infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Mixed thrombi were present in small veins (Figure 8A) and hyaline thrombi appeared in microvessels. Overall, the pulmonary features were of diffuse alveolar damage causing acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

In a few dilated SER, there were clusters of viral particles 70\u201390 nm in diameter (Figure 11). In some nuclei, there were membranous inclusion bodies. The endothelial cells in the vessels of alveolar septa were swollen and vacuolated.

The first case was reported around Guangzhou, southern China, but as the disease was unknown at this time, it resulted in severe infections of the medical personnel in the hospital, with an infection rate up to 33%.

The WHO is taking urgent and co\u2010operative action to combat this disease and important progress has been made in understanding its aetiology and epidemiology.",

The onset of SARS is very acute and sudden. The initial symptom is fever, which is usually high or irregular. The patients may have minor symptoms suggestive of the common cold, such as chills, chest pain, and myalgia. They also have a non\u2010productive cough and some may have traces of blood in their sputum. Neutropenia is typical. Dyspnoea is present and chest radiography shows localized or diffuse shadowing which may be progressive. In some patients, the clinical symptoms are inconsistent with the degree of pulmonary involvement, in that while their clinical symptoms appear slight, their lung lesions deteriorate progressively.",

            "text": "With regard to the aetiology and pathogenesis of SARS, this study has demonstrated extensive pulmonary consolidation; significant pulmonary oedema; localized haemorrhage and necrosis; widespread hyaline membrane formation; a local inflammatory reaction consisting mostly of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells; desquamation of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells; numerous multinucleate and mononuclear giant cells in pulmonary alveoli in two cases; and typical viral inclusion bodies in epithelial cells in alveoli in all the three cases. Viral particles were identified by transmission electron microscopy. Analysing research findings from several countries, the WHO has declared that the likely pathogen is a variant of coronavirus (CV) and has named it the SARS virus 4. The viral particles and viral inclusion bodies observed by electron microscopy and light microscopy, respectively, in this study are of a similar size and morphological form to those of the SARS virus and our findings therefore support the association of the SARS coronavirus with the pathogenesis of this disease. Although it is a variant of CV, the SARS virus has the same virological characteristics as CV. It is an RNA virus, the membrane of which contains two types of glycoprotein, E1 and E2, which bind to the receptors of the sensitive cells and enter by endophagocytosis, replicating entirely in the cytoplasm 5. Recent studies indicate that the cellular receptors for CV (CD13) exist predominantly in mononuclear cells, venular endothelial cells, epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and renal tubules, fibroblasts, brush\u2010border cells of the intestine, stromal cells in the bone marrow, and the synaptic membrane of the central nervous system. We also found that pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (mainly type 2) and epithelial cells in bronchi proliferated and desquamated, so that desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis occurred. Endothelial cells in the systemic venules also desquamated and an inflammatory reaction was present in blood vessel walls (vasculitis). Degenerative changes, apoptosis, and necrosis occurred in parenchymal organs and tissue. We believe that all of these changes most likely result from a complicated process involving (1) disturbed cell metabolism as a result of the release of a large number of viral particles following entry into sensitive cells and rapid replication; (2) intense local vascular reactions; and (3) immune impairment mediated by cellular immunity and cytokine functions 6. This conclusion requires confirmation through additional research.",

Bilateral extensive consolidation of the lungs results from a combination of the large number of desquamated and exudated cells and protein exudates that congest the lung tissues, and the extensive formation of hyaline membranes in the alveoli.

From a clinical point of view, the patients exhibit worsening dyspnoea and die of respiratory failure.",

The pulmonary lesions mainly involve alveoli and are chiefly composed of desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, for no significant changes in width were observed in most of the alveolar walls or interlobular septa. Other lesions are formation of hyaline membranes, massive exudation of inflammatory cells into alveoli, patchy haemorrhage and focal necrosis, and organization of exudates in the alveoli in patients with a prolonged disease course (A3, 20 days). The main lesions of immune organs are massive necrosis in the spleen and local necrosis in lymph nodes. Systemic vasculitis involves proliferation, swelling, and apoptosis of endothelial cells, with infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells both around the circumference of small veins and in vascular walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the interstitium of striated muscle. Fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis occurred in parts of small veins. Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland, as well as degeneration of nerve cells in the brain. It is most probable that these systemic reactions are related to viraemia.",
