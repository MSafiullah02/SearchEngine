[2] [3] Fortunately, many clinics and emergency departments are still 56 able to maintain their remote cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) monitoring capability 57 as off-site telecommuting is usually feasible. 4 Unfortunately, many health care providers that 58 electively manage CIED patients are being redirected to assist in other areas of immediate 59 clinical need and elective CIED surgeries have been temporarily suspended at many medical 60 centers. [4] [5] Simultaneously, mandates for social distancing are leading to cancellation of 61 ambulatory CIED outpatient appointments for those patients not enrolled in remote monitoring 62 and, in most circumstances, absence of manufacturer field representatives for clinical support.",
