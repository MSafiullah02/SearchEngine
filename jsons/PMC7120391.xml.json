Many nations rely on this dynamic industry as a primary source for generating revenues, employment, infrastructure development and economic growth. Over the last few years, tourism has become one of the fastest growing industries in the service sector and the second largest gross domestic product (GDP) contributing industry for Malaysia. The industry performed favorably as reflected in the growth of tourist arrivals and tourist receipts. According to the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board (MTPB),1 total tourist arrivals reached a high record of 20.7 million in 2007 as compared to 1.2 million in 1974. The share of tourism revenue in total earnings of the services account of the balance of payment increased from 32.7% in 2000 to 43% in 2005 while net contribution by tourism improved by RM11.2 billion to RM18.1 billion for the same period.2\n",

The Malaysian tourism industry also faced increasing competition from other developing countries within the Asian region to gain market share in the tourism industry. At the same time, well-known industry players such as Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore are launching aggressive promotions to attract tourists particularly from the long-haul markets (the US and Europe). In addition, a series of mishaps such as the Asian financial crisis (1997), avian influenza (1997), the September 11 incident in the United States (2001), Bali blasting on October 12 (2002), the Iraq War (2003), JW Marriot Hotel bombing in Jakarta (2003), the SARs (2002) and the Tsunami aftermath (2004), have adversely affected the tourism industry. The number of tourist arrivals declined substantially because foreign tourists are concerned about their safety and security when traveling in the Asian region.",
