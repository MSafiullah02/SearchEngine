And on the other hand, although most of the microbial world operates independently of animals, animals can profoundly impact co-occurring microbes in communities and ecosystems. Examples include the introduction of European earthworms to a North American forest which led to massive declines in soil\u2013microbe biomass and respiration. And rats introduced onto small Pacific islands decimated seabird populations, resulting in decreased guano input, which altered decomposition and nutrient cycling by soil microbes and created a dramatic reduction in ecosystem productivity (Fukami et al. 2006).",

Starting with Louis Pasteur\u2019s discovery of the link between germs and disease, microorganisms were of interest mainly because they were considered to be causes of infectious diseases. In the last 100 years, numerous microorganisms were identified as the causative agents of important human diseases, and bacteriologists, microbiologists, and immunologists are continuing to focus on bacteria as pathogens. This approach has led to enormous insights in the battle between the invading harmful microbes and the host, as well as enabled the development of efficient strategies to fight infections. However, most bacteria are not harmful to plants or animals, and many of them are beneficial, playing a key ecological role. Louise Taylor and colleagues from the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh have used the published literature to compile a list of organisms known to be pathogenic to humans, together with the available information on whether they are zoonotic, whether they are regarded as emerging, and on their transmission routes and epidemiologies. Their estimate indicates that only 200 of the millions of bacteria that interact with humans are pathogenic (Taylor et al. 2001).",

Two teams of microbiologists\u2014one headed by Carl Woese (Woese and Fox 1977) and ther other by W.

Algae have swallowed up bacterial partners and have themselves been included within other single cells.

The answer that this question usually invokes is that levels of oxygen in solution in ancient oceans, which had been increasing gradually, suddenly breached a threshold that could sustain the greater demands (motility, etc.) of animal life. Since the great oxygenation event, the activities of cyanobacteria had brought about steady increases in atmospheric O2, so that by the late Vendian and early Cambrian, atmospheric O2 was probably near present-day levels. The Ediacaran animals were restricted to those patches of shallow water that were relatively well oxygenated; the deeper oceans were in transition from being predominantly anoxic and sulfide-rich to being anoxic but iron-rich and possibly also rich in dissolved organic carbon, but still hostile to all but microbial life.",

Zooplankton grazing may have selected for large phytoplankton that were export prone (i.e., upon demise, prone to sinking to the benthos and thus exporting production from the photic zone), effectively transforming what was a cyanobacteria-dominated and anoxic water column that was probably also turbid and stratified into a mixed and aerated system dominated by eukaryotic algae. By causing mixing of the oceans, animals started to transform the environment and thus not only to alter the distribution of microbes but also to open new niches for microbial colonization. Animals, therefore, have thus been major agents of change since their early origins.",

The assumption has been that simple morphology equates to a simple gene set; fewer genes should be required to build a sea anemone than a fly, but this seems not to be true. Sequencing data from cnidarians in particular, but also from sponges, revealed the presence of many genes previously only known from vertebrates and assumed to have evolved in the chordate lineage on the basis of absence from the genomes of the only other metazoans for which data were available at that time, the fruit fly Drosophila and the worm Caenorhabditis. The cnidarian data in particular have led to the broad (but not universal) acceptance of the idea that genetic complexity came very early in animal evolution, but that widespread gene losses and sequence divergence have occurred and affected some lineages more than others.",

The lesson from the comparative genomics of higher animals is that their genomic \u201cdictionaries\u201d share common and deep evolutionary ancestry. This major discovery became possible when a minimum number of genomes had been fully sequenced, the analyses of which are totally reshaping the way biologists view relationships in the biosphere. Examination of these genomic data reveals that essential all life forms share ~1/3 of their genes, including those encoding central metabolic pathways. Many animal genes are either direct descendants of microbial genes or the result of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For example, 60 % of the ~23,000 human genes trace back to at least the origin eukaryotes (Fig. 2.4). The products encoded by these shared genes may provide the foundation for much of the signaling and communication among extant taxa of these two divergent groups.\n",

From a randomly chosen representative subset of unassembled, filtered reads (120,000 out of 217,873 total), 7720 (6.4 %) were putatively assigned to the bacterial domain of life, and a very small number were assigned to archaea (161, 0.1 %) (Srivastava et al. 2010).

Similar to observations in Hydra and Nematostella, the Symbiodinium genome provided evidence for the close association with alphaproteobacterium. The largest scaffold in the assembly appears to form a circular DNA of 3.8 Mbp. The GC content of the scaffold was 53 %, compared to 44 % in S. minutum. In addition, no expressed sequence tag (EST) data were mapped onto the putative bacterial genome fragment, indicating that the source of this DNA was quite different from Symbiodinium. Phylogenetic analysis with the contaminant 16S ribosomal RNA sequence indicated that this organism shows the closest match to Parvibaculum lavamentivorans DS-1. P. lavamentivorans DS-1 T is the type of species of the novel genus Parvibaculum in the novel family Rhodobiaceae (formerly Phyllobacteriaceae) of the order Rhizobiales of alphaproteobacteria.

Detailed, case-by-case analysis of regulatory and signaling pathways shared by N. vectensis and higher animals has confirmed a Premetazoan origin for many of these pathways, either in substantially complete form or in simpler versions that have been elaborated later in metazoan evolution by molecular \u201ctinkering.\u201d",

The bacterial and phage genes are located in distinct scaffolds, which can be separated from those corresponding to the DNA of the target organism, N. vectensis, by several criteria, including the nucleotide composition and the provenance of neighboring genes; the spurious character of introns annotated in these genes; and a rich and apparently randomly drawn repertoire of predicted protein functions, which include several molecular roles considered to be prokaryote specific. The majority of bacterium-like genes from the N. vectensis genome project are phylogenetically closer to Bacteroidetes or Proteobacteria homologs than to any eukaryotic homolog. Two distinct bacterial genera are clear leaders in high-sequence similarity of these bacterium-like proteins. They are Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium (80\u201385 % and 85\u201395 % median identity of amino acids to their nearest database homologs, respectively), separated by many hundreds of millions of years of bacterial evolution. Thus, a considerable fraction of N. vectensis genes in fact are bacterium-like genes annotated as belonging to N. vectensis but encode proteins of bacterial origin. The phylogenetically closest database matches of these bacterium-like sequences originated from several clades of bacteria, but nearly two-third of them belonged to one of two clades: Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes.",

CRISPR stands for \u201cclustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats\u201d and CAS for \u201cCRISPR-associated genes.\u201d In 1987, Ishino and his colleagues discovered an unusual structure of repetitive DNA downstream of the E. coli inhibitor of apoptosis (iap) gene, consisting of invariant direct repeats and variable spacing elements. In 2002, Jansen and colleagues coined the term CRISPR and reported that CRISPSs colocalized with specific cas genes. CRISPS/CAS systems are exclusively found in prokaryotes and are present in approximately half of all bacteria and almost all archaea (Grissa et al. 2007). Analysis of bacterial and archaeal genome sequences and the associated viral and plasmid sequences led to the realization that CRSIPS spacers, which resemble fragments of foreign genetic elements, were derived from invading genomes (Barrangou et al. 2007). This breakthrough, together with the detection of CRISPR locus transcripts with defined length of one or more spacer repeat units, and the predicted nucleic acid-related activities for many of the cas genes, led the team of computational biologists around Eugene Koonin at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) in Bethesda, to propose that CRIPS/CAS neutralizes invaders via a mechanism reminiscent of RNA interference (Makarova et al. 2011). Soon after, Rodolphe Barrangou, Philippe Horvath, and colleagues provided the first experimental evidence that the CRIPS/CAS system of the lactic acid bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus functions as an inheritable, adaptive prokaryotic immune system conferring phage resistance. The bacterial genome integrates a sequence of the viral genome, called a spacer, upon infection; that sequence later serves as a guide for destroying any matching DNA, so that subsequent viral infections are fended off (Horvath and Barrangou 2010).",

Both animals and plants do have formidable molecular arsenals that can be deployed against invading foreign DNA, which accounts for the rarity of lateral gene transfers (LGTs) into their genomes.

The genome of a marine sponge, Amphimedon queenslandica (Fig. 2.5), has provided fascinating insights into the origins of animal evolution (Srivastava et al. 2010). The A. queenslandica genome harbors an extensive repertoire of developmental signaling and transcription factor genes, indicating that the metazoan ancestor had a developmental \u201ctoolkit\u201d similar to that in modern complex bilaterians. Analysis of the Amphimedon genome and expression studies done by Maja Adamska\u2019s team at the SARS Center in Bergen (Adamska et al. 2010; Adamska et al. 2011; Fortunato et al. 2014) demonstrate that all major metazoan signaling pathways are used during sponge embryogenesis. Wnt, tgf-\u00df, and hedgling\u2014related to hedgehog transmembrane protein\u2014genes are expressed in dynamic, partially overlapping patterns in Amphimedon embryos. Similarly to higher animals, the wnt pathway appears to be used in establishment of the anterior\u2013posterior axis of the sponge embryo. The origins of many of these and other genes specific to animal processes such as cell adhesion, and social control of cell proliferation, death, and differentiation can be traced to genomic events (gene birth, subfamily expansions, intron gain/loss, and so on) that occurred in the lineage that led to the metazoan ancestor, after animals diverged from their unicellular \u201ccousins.\u201d In addition to possessing a wide range of metazoan-specific genes, the Amphimedon draft genome is missing some genes that are conserved in other animals, indicative of gene origin and expansion in eumetazoans after their divergence from the demosponge lineage and/or gene loss in Amphimedon.",

Surprisingly, the genome of the filasterean holozoan Capsaspora, which may have been secondarily reduced given its endosymbiotic (or parasitic) lifestyle, encodes a number of \u201cmetazoan\u201d transcription factors that have been lost from choanoflagellates, including the RUNX, NFk, and the T-box protein Brachyury. As efforts to sequence the genomes of a truly representative range of close outgroups and early diverging ingroups of the Metazoa continue, it is likely that the list of animal-specific genes will continue to shrink. In reality, only a small number of gene families or protein domains are likely to be restricted to the animal kingdom.",

Classic examples include the cellulose biosynthetic genes of ascidians, whereas cellulose is a common cell wall constituent in plants, fungi, slime molds, and bacteria, among animals, it is only known from the tunics of ascidians. This distribution gave rise to the idea that the biosynthetic pathway was acquired in ascidians by \u201chorizontal transfer\u201d (= LGT). However, if the genes were acquired by LGT, this happened a long time ago\u2014much longer ago than is usually implied when LGT is invoked\u2014because cellulose synthase genes from ascidians that diverged deep in the Cambrian are very similar. Rather than a recent LGT, this pushes the time of any \u201chorizontal transfer\u201d of cellulose synthase genes to very early in metazoan evolution. Similar scenarios apply to a number of other animal genes with anomalous distributions.",
