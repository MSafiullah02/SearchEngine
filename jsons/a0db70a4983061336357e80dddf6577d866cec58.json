A global pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has created unique challenges to providing timely care for cancer patients. In early-stage cervical cancer, postponing hysterectomy for 6-8 weeks is suggested as a possible option in the Covid-19 burdened hospitals. Yet, literature examining the impact of surgery wait-time on survival in early-stage cervical cancer remains scarce. This study examined the association between surgery wait-time of 8 weeks and oncologic outcome in women with early-stage cervical cancer.",

Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was additionally performed.",

Women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates 91.2% versus 90.7%, HR 1.11, 95%CI 0.47-2.59, P = 0.818; Fig. 2A) and OS (4.5-year rates 95.0% versus 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50-4.31, P = 0.487; Fig. 2B) similar to those in the short wait-time group. This association was unchanged when the whole cohort was analyzed with a generalized boosted model (data not shown). In a sensitivity analysis, cases were limited to stage IB-IIA disease. In a propensity score weighted model (n = 158), there were 24 (15.2%) recurrences and 14 (8.9%) deaths during the follow-up (median, 4.8 years). Similar to the whole cohort, long wait-time was statistically not associated with DFS (4.5-year rates 83.4% versus 84.3%, HR 1.21, 95%CI 0.54-2.70, P = 0.647; Fig. 3A) and OS (4.5-year rates 91.1% versus 97.4%, HR 2.40, 95%CI 0.75-7.61, P = 0.137; Fig. 3B) when compared to the short wait-time in a propensity score weighted model. Among squamous tumors (n = 186) in a propensity score weighted model, there were 16 (8.6%) recurrences and 13 (7.0%) deaths recorded during follow-up (median, 4.4 years). DFS (4.5-year rates 85.6% versus 92.3%, HR 1.67, 95%CI 0.61-4.56, P = 0.318; Fig. S3A) and OS (4.5-year rates 90.0% versus 97.8%, HR 2.30, 95%CI 0.67-7.98, P = 0.187; Fig. S3B) were statistically similar between the long wait-time group and the short wait-time group.",
