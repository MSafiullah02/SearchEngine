Pneumonia is one of the most common infections in liver disease patients with cirrhosis admitted in CCU. [1, 2] The prevalence of pneumonia is reported in about 21.4% of cirrhotic patients with mortality rates as high as 37%-41%. [3] There are several consequences of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients which include acute on chronic liver failure, multiple organ failure, sepsis, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality. [4] Although pneumonia exhibits higher mortality in patients with cirrhosis, majority of the studies focused on bacterial pneumonia as the most common cause of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients; other pathogens especially are usually underestimated in such patients and are often not underreported. [5, 6] There are very few studies which have shown the influence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients in CCU. [7] [8] [9] Till now, there is no published study showing the prevalence of RVs and their bacterial coinfections in cirrhotic patients admitted in CCU care. With this background, the purpose of the current study is to investigate the prevalence of RVs in cirrhotic patients with pneumonia and its impact on the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients with pneumonia admitted in CCUs.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or throat swab/ nasal swab (TS/NS) was collected from cirrhotic patients with pneumonia. BAL sample was collected by trained pulmonologist patients on mechanical ventilator because the TS/NS could not be from them. TS and NS were collected from nonventilated patients with pneumonia.

Complete clinical characteristics of the patient and other biochemical parameters were recorded from the hospital information system.

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study representing the investigation of viral pneumonia in cirrhotic patients in CCUs. In the present study, we evaluated the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and prognosis of cirrhotic patients with viral pneumonia in CCUs. Specimens obtained from the upper airway as TS/NS are often used for RV testing in pneumonia patients due to ease of specimen collection in comparison to bronchoscopy collected BAL sample. [11] However, in the current study, the proportion of RVs detected from BAL samples were more than TS/NS though not significant. Therefore, here comes the importance to perform bronchoscopy and collection of BAL sample in the most affected lung segment according to the radiographic signs to recover the responsible respiratory pathogen in patients with pneumonia, especially in patients having chronic liver disease. Over the past decade, several studies have consistently demonstrated RVs to be the second most common etiological factor of CAP, accounting for 13%-50% of diagnosed cases of pneumonia in noncirrhotic patients in CCUs. [2] Our study has demonstrated that the proportion of RV infections was little higher in the HCAP group than in the CAP group in cirrhotic patients, which is similar to one recent study done in nonliver adult patients. [12, 13] A high index of suspicion of viral pneumonia is always necessary in patients with cirrhosis because there are no distinctive clinical features to differentiate between viral and bacterial pneumonia.; hence, a high index of suspicion is necessary for this infection. None of the previously done studies have shown the spectrum of different RVs in liver disease patients. Only a few studies done in our center have shown the prevalence of influenza virus and its impact on the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients. [7, 8, 14] The current study has found that respiratory viral infections other than influenza virus infection are also an important etiology of pneumonia in liver disease patients with cirrhosis admitted in CCUs. Transmission dynamics and seasonal distribution of RVs are key importance in understanding and limiting burden of morbidity and mortality of pneumonia patients in CCUs. [15] In the current study, no clear seasonality is seen for human RhV. Flu A virus and RSV were mainly present in winter months. This finding can inform the timing of Flu A and RSV vaccination and the judicious use of antibiotics in cirrhotic patients admitted in CCUs. Mixed viral and bacterial infections are widely described in pneumonia patients in CCUs; however, the presence of these coinfections on the cirrhotic patients' clinical outcome remains poorly studied. [16] Various studies suggest that viral and bacterial coinfections lead to a higher severity ongoing disease, especially in patients with chronic disease. [16, 17] We did not find any significant correlation in mortality and median length of stay in CCUs in patients with only RV infection and viral-bacterial confection which is not in concordance of previous done studies. [18] Our study had some limitations. First of all, our study was a single-center cohort and done in a small duration period. Considering small number of patients, our observations should be confirmed in larger sample size with more detailed subgroup in future study. Second, our study excluded cirrhotic patients with cancer and immunosuppression. Therefore, exclusions may result in statistic bias and inexact conclusion. Nevertheless, our investigation provided the first comprehensive study of the prevalence of RVs and its epidemiology in cirrhotic patients with pneumonia in CCUs. With the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with RV infections and the lack of directed antiviral therapy for most of these infections, prevention remains the mainstay for reducing their incidence and controlling transmission of RVs, especially in CCUs settings.",
