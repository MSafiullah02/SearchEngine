If the patient had multiple CT examinations during hospitalization, the first CT and the most severe CT examination during the disease progression were scored separately. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) showed a slight increase in density, but the bronchial vascular bundles could still be displayed. Consolidation was defined as opacification in which the underlying vasculature was obscured.

In addition, the patients in the fibrosis group have a high level of C-reactive protein. The C-reactive protein rises sharply in the plasma when the body is infected or tissues are damaged, it activates the complement system and strengthens the phagocytosis of phagocytes, and removes pathogenic microorganisms that invade the body [16, 17] . It plays an important protective role in the body's natural immune process, which may accelerate fibrosis formation during this process.",
