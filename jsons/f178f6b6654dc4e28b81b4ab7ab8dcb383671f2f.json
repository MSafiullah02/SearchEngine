Speckle-tracking echocardiography measures the relative movement of myocardial greyscale alterations (speckle patterns) and can thereby quantify systolic deformation, strain, describing percentage changes in myocardial segment length. The most frequently used strain variable is global longitudinal strain (GLS), which has been introduced for the detection of LV dysfunction. 14 In sepsis, strain imaging has the ability to detect impaired LV 15, 16 systolic function not appreciated by conventional echocardiography.",

Furthermore, neither PVRI nor effective pulmonary arterial elastance (E pa ), a measure of the total RV afterload, was It has previously been shown that the RV free wall strain in patients without cardiopulmonary disease ranges between \u221224% and \u221229 with a mean of \u221227 \u00b1 2%. 19 In the present study, 64% of the patients had a RV free wall strain > \u221224%, with a mean of \u221221 \u00b1 5% at baseline (75 mmHg), suggesting that RV function was compromised, confirming previous strain echocardiographic studies on patients with severe sepsis. 15 Ventricular strain is a load-dependent myocardial deformation variable, which is sensitive to changes in preload, as shown in a clinical strain echocardiographic study. 21 Furthermore, an increase in inotropic stimulation increases ventricular strain, also when preload and afterload are controlled. 22 In the present study, the NE-associated improvement in RV free wall strain was, most likely, caused by an increase in RV preload. A more or less, positive \u03b2 1 -receptor-mediated inotropic effect could also contribute to the improved RV performance with norepinephrine. LV contraction may also contribute to RV ejection mediated through septal contraction. 23 Although we did not measure the degree of septal contraction in the present study, we believe it is unlikely that the improvement in RV systolic function, induced by norepinephrine, was caused by enhanced septal contraction, as norepinephrine did not induced changes in LV systolic function. They attributed this beneficial effect of norepinephrine to a restoration of a low diastolic arterial pressure, which would improve coronary perfusion and LV performance and/or a norepinephrine-induced stimulation of upregulated \u03b2 1 -adrenergic receptors.",

Another limitation is that we only studied the acute effects of NE on cardiac function and pulmonary haemodynamics and we can therefore not draw conclusions on the potential long-term effects of norepinephrine on these variables in septic shock.

In spite of the norepinephrine-induced increase in LV filling pressure, which should potentially augment the preload-sensitive LV GLS, 21 such an increase was antagonised by the simultaneous increase in LV afterload, resulting in no net effect on LV GLS. 21 Our data do not support the findings from the recent study by Hamzaoui et al 24 They showed that norepinephrine administration during early (within 3 hours) resuscitation of septic shock patients, to increase MAP from 56 to 80 mmHg, increased LV ejection fraction.",
