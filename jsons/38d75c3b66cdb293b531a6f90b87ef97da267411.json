As for other viral infections, clinical manifestations include fever, cough, shortness of breath, myalgias, and sputum production. [4] [5] [6] [7] Dyspnea develops in over half of patients at a median of 8.0 days from illness onset. 5 20%-51% of patients have other comorbid medical conditions. The majority (~83%) have leukopenia and lymphopenia; patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to be older and have lower white cell and lymphocyte counts. 8 All patients developed abnormal radiographic findings including bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacities on chest CT. 8 https://medium.com/@nigam /highe r-co-infec tion-rates -in-covid 19-b2496 5088333). The overall case fatality rate for documented pneumonia has been reported variably as 1.4%-2% but may be lower in the absence of comorbidities (eg, 0.5%-1.0% or less). 4, 9 Significant variability seems to exist also in the clinical progression of disease between regions suggesting viral strain differences. Potential antiviral effects of immunosuppressants are untested. 11, 12 An unblinded study of respiratory viral loads with azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine provides a basis for trials which include data on inflammatory markers, viral loads, and diagnostic techniques. 13 Given the apparent role of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 infection, the benefits of more modest, individualized, reductions coupled with addition of immune modulation (eg, statins, modest dose corticosteroids or IL-6 inhibition therapies) might be consid- We do not yet know the incidence of asymptomatic infection and how long infectious virus persists during convalescence, notably among immunocompromised hosts. There is an urgent need to define viral pathogenesis, correlates of immunity, and biomarkers for the risk for progression. Cell entry is via the ACE2 receptor (on the X-chromosome) which is secreted in women and may reduce cellular entry -possibly accounting for gender differences in severe illness.",

Equally important, such assays allow description of the epidemiology of infection including determination of the duration of carriage, transmission probability and identification of susceptible hosts. With the pandemic of novel Coronavirus-19 or COVID-19 associated with the virus SARS-CoV-2, almost 500 000 cases have been identified worldwide with over 22 000 deaths reported.

SARS-COV-2 shares 79% sequence homology with SARS CoV and 50% homology with MERS CoV. Interperson spread of SARS-COV-2 appears to occur from minimally symptomatic individuals as well as from superspreaders, individuals who transmit infection more often to other persons, as was seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, a Massachusetts, USA coronavirus cluster with at least 82 cases was started by asymptomatic individuals. The error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV allowed mutation and adaptation of SARS to human hosts (not observed in for other hosts. Many patients had no known epidemiological contacts. Common symptoms have been fever, fatigue, and dry cough at the onset of illness. Few patients manifest upper airway symptoms such as congestion or rhinorrhea. Multiple patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities are observed on all chest radiographs, often at presentation. Leukopenia and marked lymphopenia are observed in most patients. Many patients have a significant increase in serum LDH levels with inconsistent elevations of inflammatory markers. Renal function is impaired to varying degrees in all kidney transplant recipients. This may reflect rejection following reduction in immunosuppression or with interferon therapies, or from the inability to monitor calcineurin inhibitor levels in the face of drug interactions with lopinavir/ritonavir therapy -each intervention specified in the \"Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Provisional 5th Edition from China's National Health Commission). 10 Overall, the progression of disease has varied but appears to be more rapid in immunocompromised hosts with greater rates of ICU admission and death (a fatality rate of ~21.4%). Some recipients have viral or bacterial superinfection at the time of presentation with COVID-19. Other viral respiratory infections remain common. Reductions in immunosuppression are strongly advocated by many clinicians; this approach risks immune reconstitution and rejection but may improve viral clearance. Many transplant recipients have recovered with or without such manipulations.",

Case fatality rates remain to be determined in immunocompromised hosts. This new epidemic is overwhelming healthcare resources in some regions and forcing rationing of care, including ICU beds and ventilatory supports. In some countries with resources stretched by epidemic infection, transplant patients may be excluded from assisted ventilation. Life-saving transplantation allows our patients to lead productive lives in the face of organ failure. We should not allow infections disproportionately affecting transplant recipients to limit their access to clinical interventions offered to individuals with other, potentially less reversible, clinical comorbidities. As was noted by Michaels and by Gori, the management of organ donation is critical. 14,15 Life-saving transplantation is generally continuing in screened recipients; decisions must be individualized. Many centers have cancelled live donor transplants to avoid exposure of healthy donors to the hospital and of potentially infected recipients to immunosuppression. Procurement teams must use respiratory precautions. Approximately 15% of infected individuals demonstrate RNA-emia, 5 some with viral loads in excess of 10 million copies per mL (unpubl. data, Hans Hirsch, Basel). Transmission from infected donors to immunosuppressed recipients is not yet described; the viral receptor is ubiquitous. Ideally, both donors and recipients should be screened in affected regions. Sensitive assays exist using either bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal swab specimens; testing in some areas remains limited. Some false negative assays have been identified in early infections which may impair any strategy developed. Blood samples should be obtained and banked for subsequent analysis. Empiric antiviral therapies may be considered if donor or recipient screens are positive but all should be considered experimental. Agents include boosted lopinavir or darunavir which carry significant interactions with calcineurin inhibitors and may only provide benefit if used early 16 ; remdesivir with or without other agents; chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which have both antiviral effects by blocking egress of SARS-CoV-2 from endocytic vesicles and anti-inflammatory effects (with caution regarding dosing, significant side effects and drug interactions); and interferon-1\u03b2 and inhaled \u03b1-interferon. Achievement of effective antiviral levels with these agents is uncertain. Anti-inflammatory therapies (eg, anti-IL-6 or corticosteroids) are generally reserved for those with progressive pneumonia. Reduction of the spread of infection will require the determination of the extent of community spread, viral mutation rates, and whether various viral strains have differing transmission kinetics.",
