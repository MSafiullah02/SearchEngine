In livestock populations, network-based models based on data on animal movements between farms have been a key area of research (Bajardi et al., 2012; Craft, 2015; Green et al., 2006; Kao, 2002; Kao et al., 2007; Rossi et al., 2015). However, animal movement data is rarely available for livestock industries in the United States due to the lack of a comprehensive national livestock traceability program. This limits capabilities to predict the dynamics of infectious diseases at the landscape, regional, and national levels and hinders development of risk-based surveillance and control measures based on movement data. Animal movement data may be particularly important for the swine industry, where production is highly vertically integrated in that pigs are moved between multiple premises between birth and slaughter, with each premise potentially located in different states (Valdes-Donoso et al., 2017). Such frequent and long distance movement makes the U.S. swine industry vulnerable to infectious disease epidemics.",

Although the potential importance of such mechanisms in creating transmission opportunities between swine premises has been shown in experimental studies and outbreak investigations (Alonso et al., 2014; Bowman et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2014), indirect contact is less often accounted for in epidemiological models (Arruda et al., 2016; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2011; Thakur et al., 2015; Yadav et al., 2016). Models of pathogen spread in livestock populations focus primarily on animal movement and, in some cases, local spatial spread based on proximity between premises (Brooks-Pollock et al., 2015). Attempts to account for indirect contact are hindered due to lack of data on which farms are connected via indirect contact. However, the structured nature of U.S. swine companies provides an ideal opportunity to infer patterns of indirect contact among farms and explore the joint impact of direct and indirect transmission on the spread of pathogens.",

The disease was caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv), an RNA coronavirus in the family Alphacoronaviridae that previously was circulating in Asia (Huang et al., 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013). As the name suggests, clinical signs of PEDv include watery diarrhea and vomiting. By the end of June 2014, PEDv had spread to 30 states and impacted approximately 50% of breeding herds (Goede and Morrison, 2016). PEDv may have resulted in the deaths of at least 7 million piglets, and it may take up to 12 weeks for infected sow farms, where breeding and farrowing occur, to recover their pre-infection piglet production levels (Goede and Morrison, 2016). Furthermore, surviving piglets exhibit poor growth during the growing period (Alvarez et al., 2015).",

For example, while contaminated feed may have contributed to the rapid emergence of PEDv (Dee et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2014), there is also substantial evidence that movement of infectious pigs contributes to spread within a single flow of animals (i.e., movement of pigs from farrowing/sow farms to nurseries, and subsequently to finishing farms where fattening occurs) (Bowman et al., 2015). On a larger spatial scale, states between which there were high rates of pig movement exhibited more synchronous PEDv epidemics in terms of weekly case incidence, suggesting that pig movements created epidemiological linkages among states (O'Dea et al., 2015).",

PEDv virus can also be recovered from air samples collected up to 16 km from infected farms (Alonso et al., 2014). Taken together, these studies suggest that windborne aerosols could contribute to between-farm transmission, especially at distances less than 4.8 km (Alonso et al., 2014; Alvarez et al., 2016). In addition, fomites may also contribute to between-farm spread. For example, market trucks that move pigs to slaughter facilities may function as mechanical vectors for fomites if they become contaminated at the slaughter facility and subsequently transmit the disease to na\u00efve farms (Lowe et al., 2014).",

The objective of this research is to apply epidemiological modeling approaches to simulate the spread of PEDv at the regional scale in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. Using real-world data on observed pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we develop a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact. By fitting this model to the observed epidemiological dynamics in a geographically isolated production company of nearly 400 farms, we (i) evaluate the relative contribution of each of six direct and indirect mechanisms of between-farm transmission, and (ii) determine the most likely transmission mechanisms responsible for long-distance jumps, and (iii) discuss how these methods can be used to help producers mitigate future outbreaks. This research is among the first reports of farm-level animal movements in the U.S. swine industry (Lee et al., 2017; Valdes-Donoso et al., 2017) and, to our knowledge, represents the first epidemiological model of commercial U.S. swine using actual data on farm-level animal movement.",

Inherent to local spread is the assumption that transmission between farms is more likely between farms that are geographically closer. Mechanisms include windborne dissemination of virus aerosols, contaminated sewage or water, and movement of vehicles/personnel. Local spread is captured via a spatial transmission kernel (Supplementary Methods S1)(Keeling et al., 2004; Szmaragd et al., 2009), where the probability of transmission decreases as two farms become farther apart:P(farmjbecomesinfected)=1\u2212\u220fi1(1\u2212\u03d5\u03b1\u03c0dij\u2212\u03b1)Where farm j is an uninfected farm and dij is the distance between farm j and every infected farm i within 50 km. Distances of >50 km were not considered as local spread over long distances is unlikely. \u03d5\u03b1\u03c0dij\u2212\u03b1 represents the probability of transmission between farm i and j given distance apart in kilometers, and thus 1- \u03d5\u03b1\u03c0dij\u2212\u03b1 is the probability that transmission will not occur between those two farms. \u03d5 and \u03b1 control the shape of the transmission kernel, with \u03d5 representing the basal transmission coefficient (at dij = 0), \u03b1 controlling the steepness with which probabilities decline with distance. The power-law shape of the transmission kernel and rate at which transmission declined with increasing distance (\u03b1 = 0.312) were based on an analysis of the recovery of PEDv in air samples at various distances from infected farms (Supplementary Methods S1, Fig. S1-1) (Alonso et al., 2014). It should be noted that Alonso et al. (2014) was conducted in the same company and during the same time period as the modeled study period, making their data highly relevant for inferring airborne dissemination of virus in this system. Although PEDv recovered from air samples collected from the field were not infectious in bioassays (Alonso et al., 2014), the sample size and sampling duration (30 min) may have been insufficient to capture a low probability event (i.e., recovery of infectious virus in air). Samples were also collected during the day, when UV radiation and temperature would be expected to reduce survival. However, infectiousness of airborne PEDv has been shown experimentally (Alonso et al., 2014) and the possibility of this mechanism has been supported in epidemiological investigations (Alvarez et al., 2016; Beam et al., 2015). Thus, we believe that it is a reasonable assumption that the likelihood of infectious virus to be found in air would be proportional to the total concentration of virus (inactivated or otherwise) found in the air samples.",

However, the actual network of movement of trucks between farms was not known. Thus, a farm\u2019s risk of becoming infected via this mechanism was assumed to be proportional to the number of farms infected within its feed truck network. Thus, we defined the feed truck force-of-infection as the per capita risk at which susceptible farms become infected. For each feed truck network, this was represented as a daily probability:P(farmjbecomesinfected)=\u03b2fIkNkWhere \u03b2\nf is the transmission coefficient for feed truck related spread, Nk and Ik are the total number and number of infected farms in the kth feed truck network. Although it\u2019s possible that trucks remain contaminated even after farms recover, we made the simplifying assumption that fomite contamination would be far higher when farms are actively infected and would be negligible after farms are no longer infectious. This also applies to other fomite-related transmission mechanisms.",

Parameter sets A and D matched the data particularly well, with nearly all observed points falling within the 95% prediction interval of the model.

When comparing the interquartile range of predicted infection dates for every sow farm (Supplementary Fig. S3), the predicted interval encapsulates the observed dates most often for sets A and D. In addition, there is a general correspondence between the observed and predicted infection dates, with farms predicted to be infected in the middle or later in the study period also having observed dates that fell in middle or later for sets A and D. Mismatches occurred in the early study period, which lowered \u03c1. The model struggled to capture which specific farms should be infected early, but performance improved after the early period.

When considering the mechanism of infection in all types of farms (Fig. 4a), pig movement was responsible for approximately one quarter to one third of transmission events, whereas this proportion was nearly half when considering only transmission to sow farms (Fig. 4b). Local spread was responsible for half of transmission events when considering all types of farms, and closer to one third when considering sow farms only (Fig. 4b). Thus, it appears that animal movements were relatively more important for the infection of sow farms whereas local spatial spread was relatively more important for non-sow farms, which could be related to the fact that many non-sow farms were located in areas with higher farm density (Fig. 1). Contaminated feed was responsible for a greater proportion of sow farm infections compared to the proportion attributed to this mechanism for all farms. The remaining transmission mechanisms accounted for a relatively low percentage of events, regardless of whether we are examining the responsible mechanisms for the infection of sow farms or all farms (Fig. 4). Transmission mechanism for non-sow farms only were very similar to those of all farms (Supplementary Table S6 and Fig. S7).",

Thus, we restricted the summary of transmission mechanisms to only those simulations (n = 827) where introduction occurred prior to day 22 and evaluated the transmission mechanism responsible for the initial introduction. In this case, animal movement and feed trucks were responsible for 72.9% and 20%, respectively, of the initial transmission of PEDv to Region I. Potentially, there could have been multiple introductions into region I beginning, with the earlier introduction prior to day 22 followed by a contaminated feed event. Thus, our results do not rule out a possible role of contaminated feed in long-distance transmission events. Introduction of PEDv to region II was attributable to market trucks and within-flow transmission in 59.2% and 21.8% of simulations where region II was infected, respectively (Table 3).",

Prior to 2013, PEDv did not occur in the United States. As a result of the rapid spread and production impact of this formerly exotic disease, PEDv is considered an industry game-changer and highlights the vulnerability of the U.S. swine industry to foreign pathogens. However, mechanisms driving between-farm spread are still poorly understood. By calibrating our PEDv spread model such that simulated data matched observed epidemiological dynamics, we demonstrated that while all hypothesized mechanisms for direct and indirect transmission between-farms likely occurred to some extent, most transmission events were attributable to movement of infected animals (direct transmission) and local spatial spread (indirect transmission). However, other indirect transmission mechanisms, such as fomites related to feed trucks, market trucks, and shared support services within flows, became more important for high consequence, long distance transmission events.",

The slight under- and over-estimate of the number of sow farms infected during the early and later parts of the epidemic, respectively (Fig. 3), potentially indicate that our model did not capture some of the underlying changes in how PEDv was managed at the farm-level. During the early part of the epidemic, there was a delay in identifying the infectious agent, and PEDv was novel to swine veterinarians and producers. However, the industry adapted to PEDv and became better at mitigating between-farm spread through enhanced biosecurity, and this may explain why our model overestimates the number of infected farms in the latter stage of the modeled period.",

This contributed to the moderate rank correlation values (\u03c1 \u223c 0.39\u20130.49) and model fitness.

Region II contains most of the genetic stock (i.e., high value breeding stock) for this company, and thus these farms are subject to enhanced biosecurity measures. Although Region II eventually became infected in the observed epidemic, Region II did not become infected during the first five months. In contrast, the model predicted that Region II would become infected, and this discrepancy may be due to a failure to account for enhanced biosecurity measures utilized for genetic stock. Despite this discrepancy, it is still useful to track the mechanisms by which Region II became infected as this may highlight potential vulnerabilities in biosecurity measures. Region II usually became infected by either market trucks or within-flow transmission, which emphasizes the importance of decontaminating market trucks and preventing mechanical vectors or fomites associated with shared support services within flows. Also, our model\u2019s structure likely overestimated the role market truck transmission to Region II, given that all animals going to slaughter from Region II passed through transfer stations (market trucks did not directly visit Region II farms).",

Similarly, biosecurity and mitigation measures employed by infected farms may lead to fluctuating infectiousness over time, which we did not allow for beyond the first week. This could lead to an overestimation of how long farms were able to transmit the virus.

In reality, the likelihood of infection by any of these routes would not be shared equally among farms; companies carefully manage the order in which farms are visited in the course of a week such that high-priority farms (i.e., farms where it is more important to prevent infection, such as sow farms) are visited early in the week, thus minimizing the likelihood of fomite contamination of personnel, vehicles, and equipment. In addition, there is often down-time between visits to \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d farms (in terms of infection) to decrease the likelihood of transporting fomites between farms. These factors were not accounted for in our model, and may have resulted in sow farms becoming infected too easily. Our model also predicted that few transmission events were due to fomite-related mechanisms. However, it is possible that the roles of fomite-related mechanisms were underestimated given that groups of farms that share the same mill or flow tend to be spatially clustered. This means that it is possible that local spatial spread soaked up at least some of the transmission that could have actually been mediated by fomites, and that our model could not distinguish between fomite transmission and local spatial spread. That being said, many of the flows and mills had farms that were highly dispersed and/or overlapped with other flows/mills, suggesting that indirect transmission via feed trucks or within flows and local spatial spread were not analogous.",

Contaminated feed may have played a larger role in the initial introduction of the virus to production systems, which is not addressed here, and more generally to the introduction of PEDv to the United States.

Lessons learnt from the PEDv epidemic in regards to how best represent the complexity of the U.S. swine industry in epidemiological models are valuable to monitoring other emerging swine pathogens. Our model is a more realistic representation to the realities of the swine industry than other between-farm modeling approaches given its ability to account for management practices and patterns of direct and indirect contact among farms unique to the vertically integrated nature of the swine industry and it could be readily adapted to model the spread of other foreign and endemic pathogens of swine in the US.
