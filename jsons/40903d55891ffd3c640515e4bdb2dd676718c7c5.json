However, in light of rapidly changing economic landscapes in and between nations, multiple \"burdens of malnutrition\" contribute to poor health and development. For example, children who do not consume adequate calories and micronutrients over long periods-beginning in utero-do not achieve full genetic potential in cognitive, reproductive and immune development. The latest series on nutrition in the renowned peer-reviewed journal, Lancet, emphasized chronic malnutrition over acute malnutrition in terms of the overall detrimental effect on society. Micronutrient deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals, such as iron, zinc, folic acid, Vitamin A and other, are also gaining importance as the scientific community proves links to disease and inhibited growth. It is, therefore, important to understand to connect food and public health systems to the role of food policies on nutrition goals and outcomes.",

In FAO's State of Food and Agriculture 2013 report, countries were classified as having one, two or three of these burdens and in different combinations. There are very few countries that do not have at least one malnutrition insufficiency or a combination. 4 Global prevalence of stunting, which reflects chronic undernutrition during the early stages of life causing children to fail to grow to their full genetic potential, both mentally and physically, has declined to 35 % in children under 5 years of age since 1990, which is a reduction of 2.1 % per year. 5 Yet, there are still an estimated 150 million children who remain moderately or severely stunted. 6 Wasting, which reflects acute malnutrition and is a strong predictor of mortality among children, impacts 50 million children under 5 years of age, with the highest burden in South Asia. There has been an 11 % decrease since 1990. 7 On the other end of the malnutrition spectrum, an estimated 43 million children under 5 years of age are overweight, and two-thirds of those children reside in low-and middle-income countries. 8 Prevalence of low body mass index (BMI) in adult women has decreased in Africa and Asia in the last 4 decades, but still exceeds 10 % in the two regions. At the same time, prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased in all regions. 9 According to the world's leading medical journal, the Lancet, \" [d] eficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals continue to be widespread and have significant adverse effects on child survival and development, as well as maternal health.\" 10 Thus, indicators of malnutrition have far-reaching effects world-wide.",

However, the sustainability of such initiatives relies heavily on sustained political will. 11 a country's food security.\" 12 A recent report published by the UN Nutrition Sensitivity of Agriculture and Food Policies, however, concluded that the \"complex role of how agricultural policies can effectively address nutrition is not yet well understood.\" 13 Additionally, the UN Standing Committee on Nutrition found that \" [t] here is considerable conceptual knowledge on this topic, but little understanding of how to carry concepts and policy objectives into effective implementation and delivery of food-based approaches that impact nutritional status of populations.\" 14 By focusing on the entire human lifecycle, nutrition-sensitive agriculture and food policies should consider the nutrients and determinants that are important for development, growth, and maintenance of health at various stages of life. The approach should encompass the entire food system-a complete array of activities covering all stages of the food supply chain ranging from input distribution, on-farm production, marketing, processing, and storage. The goal should be to produce healthy and safe food containing essential micronutrients and to increase yearround, affordable access for both rural and urban communities, as the consumers. Food policies and programs are relevant to ensure that food systems from production to processing to consumption are directed to ensuring improved dietary patterns and nutrition outcomes. Debate continues between those who argue that agricultural policy should play a large role in producing nutritious food and those who believe that it is more important for agricultural policy to focus on economic development and \"feeding the planet\" in the form of bulk calories. 15 This chapter attempts to unpack the importance of food and agriculture policies on nutrition outcomes and why engagement of food and public health systems remain critically important.

            "text": "There is clear and convincing evidence for anthropogenic climate change. 16 The warming of the earth will have devastating consequences including more extreme weather conditions, rising seas leading to salination of agriculture and drinking water sources, and acidification of oceans, in which many people rely on for their diets and livelihoods. These effects will impact food security, nutritional outcomes and public health. The increased climate variability will intensify the severity and frequency of natural disasters. Both floods and droughts are and will continue to occur more frequently. 17 Predicting weather patterns will become much more difficult as the variability related to climate change increases. 18 Climate change is having, and will have, very different effects depending on where people live and which resources are available to them. The poor will be impacted the most and suffer the greatest repercussions. Risks of food insecurity and health will also impact the poorest nations-ironically, those who had made the least anthropogenic contribution to climate change. 19 These changes are also likely to have the greatest impact in many low resource regions' agricultural outputs, reducing yields of crops, soil fertility, and forest and animal productivity, which may lower income, resiliency and subsequently, reduced access to sufficient, nutrient dense foods and impaired nutritional status of communities. 20 Unstable agriculture output could increase global prices for food and their volatility, 21 while urban areas will be especially vulnerable in accessing food. 22 The poorest communities, especially female headed-households, will feel the consequences of rising food prices most strongly. 23 Increases in food costs force people to reduce the quantity and nutrient-quality of food consumed, preferentially affecting those who are in need of nutrient dense foods like young children and pregnant or lactating women. 24 In addition, diminished biodiversity, which is an important source of diverse diets, may, \"increase the risk of disease being transmitted to human beings, a phenomenon termed the dilution effect.\" 25 Thus, it has been estimated that 80 % of the burden of disease related to climate change will affect children and that by 2050, with a potential projection of a 20 % increase in malnutrition. 26 Climate variability, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, \"could eliminate much of the improvement in child malnourishment levels that would occur with no climate change.\" 27 In fact, some studies estimate an even greater impact with stunting increasing by as much as 30 % compared to a scenario in which climate is stable. 28 Additionally, the disease burden will also be impacted with a warmer world, which will in turn, effect the public health system. As global temperature rises, health impacts will change. With increasing severity of heat waves, heat-related stress will increase short-term mortality from stroke, respiratory and cardiovascular incidents. 29 Rising temperatures will also increase the spread and transmission of vector and rodent-borne diseases as well as density, pathogen maturation and replication within mosquitos resulting in increases in infections of malaria, dengue fever and other vector born diseases. 30 It is estimated that malaria, diarrhea and protein-energy malnutrition together cause more than 3 million deaths each year. 31",

Although the trend is overall positive, the continued population growth and its resulting pressure will have impacts on our food and public health systems. Results will include pressures upon public health, sustainable food production, environmental conservation, and the prevention of climate change as a challenge of industrial food production.",

An estimated 30-50 % of the world's food is never consumed, but, instead, wasted or disposed of somewhere along the value chain between the producer and the consumer. 41 In high-income countries, most of the food waste that occurs is with the consumer or the retailer, such as food markets, restaurants, convenience stores. In low-income countries, most of the food wasted is due to post harvest losses and a lack of infrastructure, transport and technology.",

Although the main strategy has been to provide information for consumers, countries have made notable steps in reformulating food products, establishing school food standards, nutrition labeling, restricting food marketing to children, promoting fruits and vegetables, and more recently, implementation of food taxes. However, when it comes to national food and agricultural policies, the focus remains mainly on producers. The policies are also not designed with public health in mind. For example, the relationship between population nutrition and chronic disease risk is often ignored in most agriculture policies, 56 which was corroborated by other analyses. One particular supporting analysis points out that current food policies are largely incompatible with good public health, but interventions that include food producers, processors, and food providers can markedly improve a population's dietary health. Such an improvement would require cooperation between farming and commercial food producers in order to counter the current trends in food supplies and to reshape the nutrition transition. 57 In the WHO nutrition policy review, 58 the most commonly reported policy activities in food security and agriculture were research (59 %) and supply of seeds (55 %), subsidized sales and construction of irrigation systems (48 %), construction of rural infrastructure (42 %), price control (41 %), international agreements to increase domestic food production (41 %), production credit from stateowned banks (39 %) and subsidized food for vulnerable groups (38 %). 59 The main policy goals of these programmes were to increase output and farm incomes, followed by improving the quality of the products.

These guidelines are quite detailed and visual and, in their development, involve a public consultation. A study that compared the 2005 U.S. dietary guidelines to the food system supply that is available for the country, found that food supply does not, on average, equal the recommended dietary guidelines. 61 The volume supplied surpasses the volume required by some two-thirds in the case of grains, and by half for both fats and sugar, while the volume of protein supplied is more than twice as high as the amount required. Similarly, the amount of oil supplied is three times as high as the amount needed, while dairy supply exceeds requirements by one-fifth. Fruit supply stands at less than three quarters of the required amount. Only vegetables come close to the recommended levels. The authors of this study also found that this imbalance between supply and demand, or better, need, is even worse for the least developed countries. 62 In addition, there is an issue with what dietary guidelines recommend to what is possible within the planetary boundaries. For example, increasing consumption of fish rich in omega three fatty acids may quickly deplete the natural marine resources that contain these essential nutrients. Thus, changing diets may have massive implications on our environment and planet. The IOM has recently recommended that U.S. dietary guidelines be more thoughtfully based on environmental as well as nutritional considerations and consider more sustainable diet options (see Chap. 10). 63 In middle-and high-income countries, attention and publicity is increasing to promote better quality of diets in terms of both nutrition and sustainability. However, it is clear that the cost of such diets is currently high 64 and even basic diets in much of the world remain costlier than daily wages due to increased food prices. 65 In South Africa, a middle-income country, a nutritious and healthy diet costs 69 % more than a typical South African diet. 66 Even in high-income countries, many people cannot meet the dietary guidelines because the cost is prohibitive or consumers do not know how to shift toward better diets. In particular, fresh fruit and vegetable recommendations are difficult to satisfy because fresh produce is more expensive across the globe. Conversely, the least expensive food alternatives are often also the least healthy and least sustainable-ultra-processed, high in sugar and fat, and high in energy cost for every dollar spent. 67 To some extent, this seemingly cheaper sticker price is due to the externalization of the food producers costs (see Chap. 16). Thus, sustainable and plant-based diets geared toward public health must become less costly so that consumers can have realistic alternatives to fast and processed foods.",

This, in turn, decreases the ability of the intestinal tract to absorb critical nutrients necessary for optimum growth and development, leading to serious consequences in nutritional status. Environmental enteropathy is often seen in young children when complementary foods are introduced along with breastfeeding. Not only are children eating more solid foods, but they also have increased exposure to the outside environment itself, leading to an increased risk of consuming contaminated foods. The provision of toilets and community led sanitation, hygiene programs, and improved systems can reduce the incidence of enteropathy. 70 Therefore, robust community public health programs are critically important to nutrition improvements and consuming food is not the only pathway to better nutrition.",

Besides manifesting distinct clinical patterns, these categories of E. coli differ in their epidemiology and pathogenesis. 73 However, succinct outcomes need to be found as well as studies conducted to determine the effect of contaminated food directly on diarrhea incidence and indirectly on anthropometry measures.

There are, at a minimum, three key sectors that need to engage, collaborate and contribute to 71 Khlangwiset et al.

These three sectors link nutrition with the functioning of and effectiveness of food, health, water and sanitation systems. 76 A robust primary health care systems approach, complemented by improved water and sanitation, can improve nutritional status. The infectious disease burden, for example, impedes consumption and the body's ability to metabolize nutrients, resulting in poor nutrient absorption and nutritional deficiencies. Consequently, one of the most important premises to improve nutrition is to control and prevent the most common childhood infectious diseases by expanding immunization programs, providing diarrhea and malaria control, treating infected patients, and decreasing parasitic burden. The backbone of some of these programs is a clean water supply, hygiene and sanitation improvements at the household and school levels. 77 The importance of clean water must not be understated and plays a role across a variety of food law and policy aspects.",

Thus, sound food production systems can improve the overall health of communities. After all, health is considered a primary goal and endpoint of food systems. 78 Similarly, poor health and dysfunctional health systems can limit agricultural productivity. Conversely, good or improved health and nutrition allow for improvements in agriculture outputs. 79 With improvements in agricultural production, in turn, household income can potentially increase and with that, more can be spent on household healthcare and other goods. Additional income can also be used to purchase higher-quality food toward a more diverse diet. Changes in agricultural production can also result in the introduction of new foods into diets. 80 Thus, the feedback loop between food and public health affects multiple sectors. A multi-sectoral approach, therefore, is the foremost method to address these concerns because it brings together a coherent range of strategies with the aim of enhancing food and nutrition security. These necessarily include interventions in agriculture and business development, healthcare, clean water, hygiene and sanitation, basic infrastructure, gender equality, and education.",

Moreover, such approaches also highlight the interdependence and the bidirectional relationships that exist between hunger and nutrition and a host of other health development challenges. 85 Recent research, for instance, has documented potential synergies between health and economic interventions, suggesting multi-sectoral approaches which may generate a wider range of benefits than single sector approaches acting alone. 86 Even while addressing broader determinants, a political priority is to address primary causes of hunger and under-nutrition in an equitable manner.",

Integrated and mixed agriculture systems such as the rice-fish aquaculture systems, poultry-orchard systems, livestock-cover crop systems all provide benefits for food production, ecological, diet and nutrition. 93 Econutrition type approaches are being piloted that integrate ecosystems services, with food production and nutrition. For example, ecological complementarity that also results in net nutritional benefit comes from the Mesoamerican \"three sisters\"-the combination of corn (a grass), beans (a nitrogen-fixing legume), and squash (a low-lying). 94 Integrated and mixed agriculture systems such as the ricefish aquaculture systems, poultry-orchard systems, and livestock-cover crop systems also provide food production, ecological, diet and nutrition benefits. 95 89 DeClerck et al.

After 6 years of intensive interventions, child growth improved with underweight and stunting levels decreasing.

            "text": "In recent years, a number of initiatives and studies have focused more directly on the question of diets and their impacts on human health, the environment, and food systems. In 2010, the FAO led an effort to develop the following consensus definition for Sustainable Diets: those diets with low environmental impacts, which contribute to food and nutrition security and to [a] healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources. 99 While elaborate, this definition reflects the important recognition that the health of human beings cannot be isolated from the health of ecosystems. 100 Thus, sustainable diets promote environmental and economic stability through low-impact and affordable, accessible foods, while supporting public health through adequate nutrition. Importantly, sustainable diets help promote sovereignty and preserve tradition involving culturally sensitive and acceptable foods. 101 In order to advance commitments to sustainable diets as a central aspect to sustainable development, one must address the gaps in our understanding of what constitutes a sustainable diet for different populations and contexts. Additionally, it is important to understand how these diets can be assessed within the global food system and how environmental sustainability in global consumption patterns and dietary goals can be achieved. Finally, it is necessary to examine how (sustainable) diets can help transform the health of populations, while promoting economic development and the slowing of environmental degradation. 102 Although many of these processes are underway, they are not yet receiving due political attention or support. This lack of political attention is partly due to the complex web of interactions between food systems, manufacturers, the environment, public health, and consumer behavior and the challenges policy makers face in making appropriate choices whether they are in government, commerce or civil society. 103",

In fact, it has been observed that the reduction in consumption of traditional foods as well as fish, eggs, and vegetables has coincided with increased consumption of soft drinks, cookies, sausages, alcohol, and pre-made meals. Brazil has two agricultural models that define the food system. The agribusiness model focuses on large-scale monocultures grown primarily for export.

Although, the agribusiness model is the dominant model nationally, accounting for two thirds of agrarian production, the family-farm model is growing and is responsible for 70 % of the food consumed in Brazil. 106 Further and future-oriented support for family-farms is likely to be more beneficial for econutrition and food safety in Brazil than industrial agriculture.",

Some of these policies contain elements of commitments towards the over-nutrition agenda, including nutrition education and focus on nutrient-rich foods, increase of access to markets, and promotion of dietary diversification. The resulting dichotomy between the two main agricultural models parallels the nutrition challenges in Brazil. Logically, then, there is a dominance of the agribusiness model, which reduces the ability of policies to target the most undernourished populations. It also is linked to the consumption of highly processed foods, which lead to obesity.

The main Nepali cash crops grown are sugarcane, oilseeds, potatoes and pulses. Thus, the agricultural sector has diversified into fruits, vegetables, spices and condiments. Overall, while the food system still focuses on the production of cereal crops, the percentage of households with holdings of fruits and vegetables is increasing. This trend has supplemented and changed farmer income, as well as increased the nutrition content of domestically produced foods and diets. However, this trend would have greater effect with an increase in the share of land used to cultivate the aforementioned crops. 108 The government of Nepal has also a demonstrated commitment to improving food and nutrition security, which is evident in the planning structure and policies across sectors that emphasize the need for improved nutrition. tor instance, The country's programs and policies look toward diversification of production, increase of production of nutritious foods, improvements in post-harvest processes, and increases in women's income. These programs and policies could be further strengthened by focusing on additional nutrition education, managing natural resources, and empowering women through multiple channels, such as improving labor and time-saving technologies, access to extension services, and supporting their rights to land and employment.",

For example, there is little effort to assess the context and cause of malnutrition at the local level and to incorporate local insights and observations into sub-national planning. The Food and Nutrition Security Plan focuses on vulnerable groups, but there could be additional policy support to expand markets and market access to these groups.

It is located in southern Asia and is bordered by China on the north and India on the east, south, and west. Agriculture dominates Nepal's economy, accounting for 34 % of the GDP and employing 70 % of the workforce. Nepal is currently in the first stage of the nutrition transition, meaning that the typical diet is low in calories and micronutrients and under-nutrition is prevalent. Staple foods, such as grains including rice, wheat and maize, which are high in energy but low in micronutrients, account for 72 % of the caloric intake of the typical Nepalese diet.",

Consequently, promoting crop varieties on the basis of micronutrient composition is considered a promising strategy to address micronutrient deficiencies and promote local foods.",

Nutrition can be built into the Agricultural Pastoral Orientation Law as a formative direction towards nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The initiative to develop a Policy Letter on Nutrition and the upcoming revision of the Orientation Law are opportunities to institutionalize nutrition-agricultural linkages in Senegal. Building nutrition capacity among government leaders in various sectors, particularly in agriculture, will address the knowledge gap and confusion that exists around nutrition-sensitive agriculture. Currently, nutrition is too poorly understood by the various professionals at the agricultural ministries to enable proactive dialogue.",

With the help of new advances in science and technology, project personnel work with villages to create and facilitate sustainable, community-led action plans that are tailored to the villages' specific needs and designed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs, in turn, reflect an understanding of the many interconnected factors that contribute to extreme poverty. Additionally, the MDGs include time-bound and measurable targets to address income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter and exclusion-while promoting gender equality, education and environmental sustainability. The Millennium Villages (MVs) are demonstration and testing sites for the integrated delivery of science-based interventions in health, education, agriculture and infrastructure. By integrating these different sectors and interventions, it was originally thought that nutrition improvements would be seen. The aim of the Project is to accelerate progress towards the MDG targets, including MDG 1-to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. The range of interventions adheres to a cost ceiling of $110 per capita sustained over a 5-10 year period, reflecting the full value of contributions from government, external donors, local communities, and the Project itself. 113 Solutions like providing high-yield seeds, fertilizers, medicines, drinking wells, and materials to build school rooms and clinics and improving food and nutrition security. Improved science and technology such as agroforestry, insecticide-treated malaria bed nets, antiretroviral drugs, the Internet, remote sensing, and geographic information systems is included to enrich this progress. Over a 10-year period, community committees and local governments build capacity to continue these initiatives and develop a solid foundation for sustainable growth. To date, the Millennium Villages project has reached over 500,000 people in 79 villages. Clustered into 12 groups across 10 African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda), the villages are located in different agro-ecological zones that reflect the range of farming, water, and disease challenges facing the continent.",

Sites range from slash-and-burn in rainforest margins to pastoralism in deserts, reflecting varied levels of population density, soil conditions, climate instability, water access, disease profiles, environmental degradation, nutritional deficiencies and food availability, market access, education levels, cultural traditions and religious norms. 114 The MVP model employs a three-pronged food and nutrition security approach. First, clinical interventions focus on persistent macro and micronutrient deficiencies in children, including vitamin A supplementation, treatment of severe acute malnutrition and regular growth monitoring. For cases of moderate malnutrition, families receive nutrient-rich flour and other food commodities. In addition, basic maternal health interventions such as basic antenatal care and institutional delivery are supported by efforts to promote adequate weight gain and improve coverage with iron and folic acid supplementation. These interventions are \"core\" to most nutrition programs in the developing world and for the most part, sit in the public health sector's responsibilities. However the MVP three-pronged nutrition approach called for more integration of other sectors to address the root causes of undernutrition.",

The Millennium Development Goals Achievement Fund (MDG-F) was established in 2007 as a comprehensive development cooperative mechanism to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The program was large-with 130 joint programs in 50 countries with the highest burdens of undernutrition-working with different UN agencies, governmental institutions, the private sector, communities and civil society entities. The Children, Food Security and Nutrition thematic area was the largest of the MDG-F and received over US$ 135 million to support 24 joint programs, implemented through the collaboration of several UN agencies. 116 The joint programs of the MDG-F promoted multi-sectoral coordination to address food and nutrition security. Three case studies were analyzed for Peru, Brazil and Bangladesh by Levinson and Balarajan (2013) . According to the authors, there were three major findings. First, convergence is important. Convergence that combines nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions can be jointly targeted to vulnerable geographical areas and populations living in these areas. Second, the results-based incentives to sub-national governmental bodies and encouragement of more proactivity and accountability to demonstrate results related to reductions in undernutrition are critically important. Third, active and sustained civil society advocacy at the policy and programmatic levels is essential. At the policy level, this advocacy serves to ensure political and administrative commitment to nutrition and food security. At the programmatic level, advocacy helps to ensure adequate budgeting, well-designed and implemented programs that meet the needs of the population. 117",
