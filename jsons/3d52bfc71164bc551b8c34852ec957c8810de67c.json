Spike glycoprotein (S) on virus surface is the main antigen of coronavirus and can be used for typing. The nuclear protein of the virus can be used for antigen diagnosis. Most understanding of the physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 comes from studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat, which can be inactivated by heating at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and by using lipid solvents such as 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform, but not by chlorhexidine. 9 The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 are as follows.",

The incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, with a median incubation period of 3 days and a maximum of 24 days. 10 2. Transmission route. The novel virus is spread through respiratory droplets when patients cough, talk loudly or sneeze. Close contact is also a source of transmission. Aerosol and fecal-oral transmission of digestive tract are also possible, while it needs to be further clarified. 3. Susceptible population. The age range of the reported infected population was 36 hours old to 96 years old, with no significant gender difference. The elderly and people with basic diseases are more likely to become severe cases. Children may have mild clinical symptoms after infection. 11 Nevertheless, medical personnel still need to pay more attention, closely monitor, and strive for early identification and timely treatment. \"Diagnosis and Treatment Program of 2019 New Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial sixth version)\" released by the National Health Commission of China on February 18, 2020 has defined as follow.

Severe cases can further develop to bilateral multiple ground-glass opacity, infiltrating shadows and pulmonary consolidation, with infrequent pleural effusion.
