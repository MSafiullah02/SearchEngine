The UK's response to the outbreak was overseen by the Department of Health, with expertise from Public Health England (PHE), the national Advisory Committee for Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). It was anticipated that the NHS could encounter a small number of UK HCWs infected with Ebola virus from overseas deployment, or infected travellers entering the UK.2 Therefore, all acute receiving medical units were advised to plan for safe assessment of individuals returning from West Africa with a febrile illness.3 There was considerable concern about what constituted the safest combination of PPE for healthcare staff to wear when assessing anyone with a possible diagnosis of EVD. Previous guidance issued by ACDP was based on expert opinion rather than a clear evidence base and did not define the specific ensemble to be used. The urgency for units to establish PPE protocols for front-line HCWs resulted in significant variance in PPE ensembles around the UK, based on local preferences and PPE availability. This issue was also identified in other countries, with variation encountered and differing guidance from bodies such as the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organisation.4\n",

ACDP Hazard Group 4 pathogens, such as EVD or another transmissible viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), currently have a more stringent level of PPE advised than airborne pathogens such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or avian influenza.5, 6 However, the consequence of transmission of all are high, therefore our aim is to have a simple standardised PPE ensemble for all HCIDs. This novel approach will reduce variability in practice, aiming to reduce risk for all HCWs involved in the care of such patients.",

Of 29 responses, 28 had different PPE protocols. It was not feasible to test fully every PPE protocol in use in the UK in the simulation exercise. Therefore five different protocols were chosen for testing: four from the units designated as the UK's Ebola surge capacity centres (Royal Free London, Sheffield, Liverpool and Newcastle) in response to the West Africa outbreak, and one from a unit with significant previous experience of assessing patients subsequently confirmed to have a VHF (Glasgow).",

The development of the mannequin and simulation exercise built on work by the UK Army medical corps when training personnel going out to work in Ebola treatment centres in W Africa.7 In brief, a mannequin was adapted to expose volunteer HCWs to synthetic bodily fluids (vomit, sweat, diarrhoea and cough), each with a different coloured fluorescent tracer, invisible unless under UV light. HCWs were trained in each PPE ensemble by repeated donning and doffing up to ten times until assessed as competent by a staff PPE trainer ahead of the simulation. During the exercise, they used PPE according to the protocol being tested, and undertook a variety of simulated clinical tasks (such as obtaining routine clinical observations). After exposure, HCWs were examined under UV lights to locate fluorescent contamination, recorded on a 35-grid bodymap and photographed, and were screened again after removing PPE (doffing) to detect any personal contamination. The exercise was videoed, allowing retrospective analysis of contamination events and user errors. This is described in detail elsewhere.8\n",

A contamination event was defined as the presence of fluorescent tracer on the skin or PPE in a single \u2018body-map\u2019 area (e.g. forearm, hand, neck, and face), which was individually assessed for all four bodily fluids. Multiple contamination events were seen on all volunteers immediately after the exercise. Participants were instructed through the process of doffing by a PPE trainer to prevent deviation from guidelines. After doffing, fluorescence could still be observed in twelve body-map areas, affecting the face, neck, forearm and lower legs. A root cause analysis (RCA) was performed for each event; recorded contemporaneous observations, film footage and photographs were retrospectively reviewed by the same three researchers to determine the mechanisms of contamination. Breaches were identified as being related either to protocol failure, such as contamination of exposed skin, or complications in PPE doffing such as when removing boot covers.

This ensemble was designed considering that even patients with confirmed VHF infections in the UK have presented early in their course of illness. Therefore, fluid-resistant rather than fully waterproof fabric was considered to be sufficiently protective. In addition, fully waterproof fabric items are less readily available. Although seepage of fluid through the sleeve of a standard surgical gown was noted in the 1st phase, this was not seen when using a reinforced surgical gown during the 2nd phase, testing the consensus PPE.\u2022The length of the gown must be sufficient to achieve a 10\u201315 cm overlap of the gown with the top of the boot. This mitigates against dripping of fluid from the gown into the boot as seen in initial testing.9 However, longer length gowns can be a potential trip hazard for smaller staff as well as trailing material being a contamination risk (see Fig. 2); long sleeves and excess material around the body can also compromise safety when doffing (see Fig. 3). Gowns should therefore be available in a range of sizes and widths to reduce this risk. Longer length gowns could be trimmed with scissors if necessary for shorter staff. Taller staff who are unable to achieve sufficient overlap with the longest available gown cannot be considered safe to proceed to provide patient care.\u2022Wide, extra-long medium thickness plastic apron (such as worn for endoscopy): although agreed that ideally PPE items should not be modified, a higher fit to protect the upper chest was desired and no such apron existed. Tearing the neck loop in the middle so both the neck and waist areas were tied was deemed an acceptable and simple modification, which significantly improved protection.\n",

While every effort has been made to balance comfort with safety, some HCWs may find that it is too claustrophobic to be able to care safely for their patient. Regular training will help HCWs to adjust to the reality of providing patient care while wearing PPE. Those identified as being unable to tolerate or wear the PPE safely can be identified in advance of a critical incident and allocated an alternative role.
