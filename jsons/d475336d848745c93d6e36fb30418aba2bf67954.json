Five developed confirmed (N = 4) or probable COVID-19 (N = 1). Prevalence of COVID-19 in our subjects, 0.9% (95% Confidence Interval, 0.1, 1.8%) was ninefold higher than 0.1% (0, 0.12%) reported in normals but lower than 10% (6, 17%) reported in hospitalised persons with other haematological cancers or normal health-care providers, 7% (4, 12%). Co-variates associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19 amongst persons with CML were exposure to someone infected with SARS-CoV-2 (P = 0.037), no complete haematologic response (P = 0.003) and comorbidity(ies) (P = 0.024). There was also an increased risk of developing COVID-19 in subjects in advanced phase CML (P = 0.004) even when they achieved a complete cytogenetic response or major molecular response at the time of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. 1 of 21 subjects receiving 3rd generation tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI) developed COVID-19 versus 3 of 346 subjects receiving imatinib versus 0 of 162 subjects receiving 2nd generation TKIs (P = 0.096). Other co-variates such as age and TKI-therapy duration were not significantly associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19. Persons with these risk factors may benefit from increased surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible protective isolation.",

An online questionnaire was distributed and collected by physicians at each centre. Persons with CML or their family (if they were too sick or died) were asked to complete the questionnaire which included two dimensions (Supplementary 1). The 1st included 16 questions assessing demographics, co-morbidities, CML-related data including diagnosis, therapy and response. The 2nd included 12 questions related to COVID-19 including exposure history, symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. Missing or unclear data items were collected and clarified by direct communication between physicians and the patient, their family and/or health-care providers. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College who waived the requirement for written informed consent. Data were analyzed as of Aril 11, 2020.

These persons had computer access and competence and tended to be proactive in seeking information and resources for their care. As such, the likelihood of detecting SARS-CoV-2infection and COVID-19 is higher than in the general Hubei population. Second, not all 18 subjects with acute respiratory illness were tested for SARS-CoV-19-infection so our prevalence estimate may be an under-estimate. However, In summary, our survey suggests that although persons with CML receiving TKI-therapy developing COVID-19 may be higher than the general population the absolute case-rate is very low and clinical features are like normals. Persons with no CHR, with co-morbidity(ies), with advanced phase at diagnosis despite responding to TKItherapy and those exposed to someone with SARS-CoV-2infection may benefit from increased surveillance and possible protective isolation Author contributions WML, QJ, LM designed the study.
