It has been supposed that high sRAGE levels could exert beneficial anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the pro-inflammatory axis of RAGE. 6, 21 If sRAGE is considered as a \"blocker\" of the inflammatory cascade, it could be \"consumed\" by its binding with pro-inflammatory RAGE ligands in order to control the inflammation generated by viral aggression. It could partly explain the lower sRAGE levels in the bronchiolitis group than in the control group here. On the other hand, it may be hypothesized that constitutive lower sRAGE levels predispose for acute bronchiolitis and severe episodes. But the results of this first observational study must be confirmed by larger and more multicentric populations before concluding a physiopathological model. A cohort study from birth, with measured sRAGE kinetics could arbitrate between a predisposing role or a post-event consequence of lower sRAGE levels in acute bronchiolitis.",

Unfortunately, we did not obtain data in control infants under one month old, so our study may be underpowered to detect significant negative correlation between serum sRAGE and age in controls. This major variation factor of sRAGE levels could explain the discrepancies in the study results of Garc\u00eda-Salido et al. 16 Their study showed a pattern opposite from ours, that is, higher serum sRAGE levels in severe acute bronchiolitis than in controls. This different pattern seems likely due to control-group factors, as Garc\u00eda-Salido et al controls were older than the target population for acute bronchiolitis with an average age of 8 years (14 This large-cohort study found that serum sRAGE levels were lower in infants with acute bronchiolitis than without acute bronchiolitis, whatever their ages. Finally, our study does not show any difference in sRAGE levels according to acute bronchiolitis severity, even after adjusting for age. In our study, age was a major confounding factor for acute bronchiolitis severity (the more severe are the youngest) and sRAGE physiological levels (higher rates are found in the youngest).",

To our knowledge, our study is the first to include healthy controls under 1 year of age, but there is no data available on sRAGE levels in this target population with which to compare our results.25 In fact, age is a double factor of bias in our study, since acute bronchiolitis is more severe in the youngest cases. An adjustment with age is thus necessary, and our results confirmed lower rates in the context of acute bronchiolitis even after this adjustment for age. The occurrence of acute bronchiolitis lowered sRAGE levels by 1.382 points, and each additional month of life lowered sRAGE levels by 86.6 points.sRAGE levels did not correlate with recurrent wheezing at 1 year following the episode of acute bronchiolitis in our cohort. Several studies have found lower serum sRAGE levels in children with asthma than in healthy children, especially when asthma is uncontrolled, and a recent study found that serum sRAGE increased after inhaled corticosteroids.14,15 Taken together, these data strongly suggest that sRAGE levels are lowered during acute (as in viral infection) and chronic (as in asthma) bronchial inflammation.This potential deficit of sRAGE during inflammatory states would argue for therapy applications. In mouse studies, modulating RAGE by inhibiting the elimination of its expression protein and using anti-RAGE monoclonal antibodies or exogenous recombinant sRAGE improved several features of lung injury in models of ARDS or of RSV infection.26,27 As RSV is the main causal virus in acute bronchiolitis, especially the most severe forms, 2 and given that neurogenic inflammation caused by RSV induces long-term bronchial hyperresponsiveness, sRAGE administration could be a promising candidate therapeutic target. Future studies should aim to test this idea.",
