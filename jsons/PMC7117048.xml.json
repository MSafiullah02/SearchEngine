The treatments were used to treat a wide variety of conditions, including cardio-cerebral vascular disease, respiratory disease, tumors, musculoskeletal disorders, and digestive system diseases (Liu et al., 2001, Tang, 2006, Tang et al., 2008). However, this form of treatment is known to produce some serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in some patients, including anaphylactic shock and fatal anaphylaxis (CNARMC Bulletin.31 December, 2007).",

            "text": "There has been a litany of poor outcomes in recent years following administration of Chinese herbal injections. Yuxingcao herbal injection (YHI), produced from a herbal extract of Houttuynia cordata, caused severe ADRs in four children, two of which were fatal, during the first half of 2006 (Ji et al., 2009). In response to these tragedies, the SFDA halted YHI use in hospitals in June 2006. After reviewing the manufacturing conditions and quality control parameters for YHI, the SFDA allowed a limited number of manufacturers to resume production (Ji et al., 2009). On October 6, 2008, six patients suffered serious adverse reactions to Ciwujia herbal injection, produced from a herbal extract from Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr.et Maxim.) Harms; the reactions were ultimately fatal in three of these patients (SFDA Bulletin. 7 Nov, 2008). Less than 1 week later, on October 11, 2008, four neonatal infants suffered serious ADRs to Yinzhihuang herbal injections made by another Chinese pharmaceutical factory; one of the babies died at 9 days old as a result (HDHP Bulletin. 20 Oct, 2008). This Yinzhihuang herbal injection was made from the extracts of four plants: Artemisia capillaris Thunb., Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, and flower of Flos lonicerae. Following the October 11 incidents, the SFDA called for a halt in the administration of these injections and retracted all remaining products from the marketplace. In February 2009, Shuanghuanglian herbal injections resulted in severe side effects in three patients and one death (SFDA Bulletin. 12 Feb, 2009a). The Shuanghuanglian herbal injection is produced from the extracts of three plants: root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, flower of Flos lonicerae, and fruit of Forsythia suspense (Thunb.) Vahl. The SFDA issued an emergency notice on February 12, 2009 to temporarily suspend the distribution and administration of this injection. Finally, on April 20, 2009, the Chinese National adverse drug reaction monitoring center (CNARMC) posted a bulletin in which it warned of the potential for severe ADRs to Qingkailing injection (SFDA Bulletin. 20 Apr, 2009b). Qingkailing injection is a complex concoction made from extracts derived from four plant species (Fructus gardeniae, Radix isatidis, Radix scutellaria, and Flos lonicerae), a number of animal products, and several additives. More than a quarter of the people who died due to their ADRs to Qingkailing injection were children under 14 years of age (SFDA Bulletin. 20 Apr, 2009b).",

Only cases involving patients who were diagnosed with a common cold or an URTI and treated with an herbal injection that resulted in severe non-lethal allergic shock (N\n = 129) or fatality (N\n = 21) were included in our analysis. A total of nine different types of herbal injections were described in these reports. Of the 150 patients who suffered severe anaphylactic reactions, 27 were children under the age of 12, and one was a pregnant woman. All 150 of these patients received emergency rescue treatments. Unfortunately, there were also 21 lethal cases, six of which involved children under 12 years of age (Table 1). Given that it is improbable that all cases of severe anaphylaxis have been reported, the anaphylactic problems associated with herbal injection treatments for colds and URTIs are likely underrepresented in the literature. This review analyzes the published reports in order to examine whether the use of herbal injections should be continued or considered contra-indicated in cases of the common cold or URTI.",

Moreover, from 2001 to 2003, 77.2% of TCM-related ADRs were due to Chinese herbal injections; and from 2004 to 2007, 80% of TCM-related ADRs were due to Chinese herbal injections (CNARMC Bulletin.31 December, 2007). The predominance of these injections among TCM-related ADRs is astounding given that they constitute a relatively small component of TCM as a whole. Hence, there is reason for concern that Chinese herbal injections may be more dangerous in the clinic than other drugs.",

Hence, the Chinese herbal injection has characteristics that distinguish it from more traditional forms of TCM: they are distilled down to a more potent form and they are injected directly into the patient\u2019s system.

We believe that this distinction is worthy of replication. We feel that traditional Chinese herbal injections should remain available for treating grave diseases and those without any other known efficient treatments, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Wang et al., 2006a). For example, YHI was chosen as one of eight TCM remedies for SARS owing to its anti-inflammatory effects (Lu et al., 2006). Furthermore, Houttuynia cordata extract (the active ingredient in YHI) has been shown to have anti-viral effects including inhibition of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Lau et al., 2008). Similar to SARS, infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) is associated with a high death rate .On February 5, 2004, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of People\u2019s Republic of China (SATCM) proposed three Chinese herbal injections for the therapy of the patients infected by H5N1: Qingkailing injection, YHI, and Shuanghuanglian herbal injection (SATCM Bulletin, 5 Feb, 2004). On April 29, 2009, Qingkailing injection was also recommended by SATCM for the treatment of potential infection with the new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus strain in China (NGPRC Bulletin.30 Apr, 2009, Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team, 2009).",

Furthermore, the chemical structures and concentrations of bioactive components within the injections have not been accurately determined. These are nontrivial matters given that some herbal injections have numerous potentially bioactive components. For example, Qingkailing herbal injection is made from the extracts of four species of plants (Fructus gardeniae, Radix isatidis, Radix scutellaria, and Flos lonicerae) in combination with various animal products (cholic acid, hyodesoxycholic acid from pig bile, Concha margaritifera Usta powder extract, and Bubalus bubalis Linnaeus horn powder extract), and additives (i.e., disodium edetate, sodium subsulfite and glycerol). Furthermore, each of the plant extracts themselves may contain a large number of chemical compounds. Elaborating upon our example of Qingkailing, Flos lonicerae extract alone contains chlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid, secologanin, sweroside, loganin, loganic acid, hederagenin, disacoside B, fulvotomentoside A, \u03b1-hederin, sapindoside B, macranthoidin A and B, macranthoside A and B, linalool, shuang-hua-chun, geraniol, \u03b1-terpineol, and eugenol among others. Radix extract constituents include sinigrin, indirubin, indoxrylglucoside, sitosterol, adenoside, hexadecanoic acid, and cane sugar. Meanwhile, Fructus gardeniae extract constituents include geniposide, gardenoside, shanzhiside, gardoside, geriposidic acid, gardenin, crocin-1, cro-cetin, scandoside and methyl ester (Zhang et al., 2006). Given the complexity of these mixtures, even the so-called advanced Chinese medicine fingerprint technology cannot provide precise quantization or consistent batch-to-batch quality and component proportion control (Zeng et al., 2006). Hence, while TCM decoctions and oral suspensions may include dozens of materials from animals and plants, we strongly suggest that the constituents of Chinese herbal injections should be restricted to only one or a few raw materials from plants. This limitation will facilitate quality control and should reduce the likelihood of ADRs, especially allergic reactions to plant and animal products.",
