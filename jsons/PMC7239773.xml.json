Retesting requests were largely driven by primary team concerns for false-negative initial test results. To avoid patients going off and back on isolation, an early interval retesting protocol was developed in which patients were held on isolation and retested 24 hours after the first result if they were categorized with high probability for COVID-19. Infectious disease physicians designated each patient with high or low probability based on the following clinical criteria consistent with reported literature7: (1) exposure to SARS-CoV-2; (2) symptoms of COVID-19, including hypoxia, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, or fever; (3) leukopenia; (4) chest imaging; (5) lack of other explanatory diagnosis. Patients labeled with high probability who tested negative were held on isolation another 24 hours for retesting. Longer-interval retesting outside this protocol continued concurrently; providers could request retesting any time during the hospitalization. If approval was granted, these patients were reisolated for possible COVID-19 pending the repeat testing.",

Interval computed tomography (CT) scans over the next 1\u20132 days revealed findings concerning for viral pneumonia. Patients were retested, and the results were positive at an interval of 1\u20133 days.6 In a larger cohort, 258 patients were retested, and 15 converted from initially negative to positive results.5 The mean interval between these tests was 5.1 days (SD, 1.5 days; range, 4\u20138 days).5 Differences in testing platforms and specimen types should be taken into consideration; the CDC recommends nasopharyngeal samples as the preferred specimen type.8 Experience with repeat testing using samples obtained by nasopharyngeal sampling is lacking at present.",
