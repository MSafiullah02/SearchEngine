Governments are under increased pressure to stop the outbreak spiraling into a global health emergency. At this stage, preparedness, transparency, and sharing of information are crucial to risk assessments and beginning outbreak control activities. This information should include reports from outbreak sites and from laboratories supporting the investigation. This paper aggregates and consolidates the virology, epidemiology, clinical management strategies from both English and Chinese literature, official news channels, and other official government documents. In addition, by fitting the number of infections with a single-term exponential model, we report that the infection is spreading at an exponential rate, with a doubling period of 1.8 days.",

With full-length genome sequences, Zhou and colleagues found that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [2] . Wu and colleagues performed phylogenetic analysis on the complete viral genome and deduced that the virus was most closely related to a group of SARS-like coronavirus previously sampled from bats in China [3] . Ji and colleagues performed comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV RNA genome sequence, and the results showed the virus to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and another coronavirus with unknown origin. They also suggested that snake is the most probable animal reservoir due to the virus's RSCU bias being closest to snake [4] . Zhu and colleagues used deep learning algorithms to analyze the gene sequences of novel coronaviruses and other coronaviruses to predict potential viral hosts. Their results indicated that bats and minks may be the two potential hosts of the novel coronavirus, while minks may be the intermediate hosts of the virus [5] . The novel coronavirus showed a similar pattern of infection to other coronaviruses in humans, particularly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-nCoV), Bat SARS-like CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCoV). After comparing coronaviruses in other vertebrates, the study found that the bat coronaviruses had the most similar infection patterns to the novel coronaviruses. After comparing the infection patterns of other vertebrate coronavirus hosts, the infection patterns of minks were found to be most similar to those of the novel coronavirus.",

Similarly, ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-nCoV and NL63 [7] [8] [9] . According to their model, the binding strength between 2019-nCoV and ACE2 is higher than the threshold required for virus infection, albeit being weaker than that between SARS-nCoV and ACE2. Zhou and colleagues conducted virus infectivity studies and showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCoV to enter HeLa cells [10] . These data indicated that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Zhao and colleagues analyzed normal lung tissue cells of eight healthy individuals, and found that the only Asian donor has over five times as much ACE2 expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors [11] . These results point to a possible heightened susceptibility of Asian population, although more evidence is needed to draw such conclusion.",

On 12th January 2020, 70 more samples from wildlife shops in the seafood market were collected for testing. PCR testing results showed that out of the 585 samples, 33 were tested positive to contain 2019-nCoV, and the virus was successfully isolated from positive samples, suggesting that the virus originated from wildlife animals sold in the seafood market in southern China [12] . However, this idea was challenged by a Lancet report detailing the first 41 infected patients who were hospitalized between 16th December 2019 and 2nd January 2020 [13] , which stated \"No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases\". Their data also showed that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. Speaking to Science, Daniel Lucey from Georgetown University noted that since the virus seems to have an incubation period of up to 14 days and the first reported case emerged on 1st December 2019, it is possible that the initial human infection took place in November if not earlier. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan before the cluster of cases from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December [14, 15] . Tracing the source of the virus, controlling the source and clarifying the intermediate host of the virus are the key links to control the continuous transmission of the virus from animals to people. Work is currently underway to determine possible virus reservoirs.",

The estimates for reproduction number R 0 differ between different research teams and are constantly updated as more information comes to light. WHO has published their estimation of R 0 to be 1.4-2.5 using early information. Jonathan Read and colleagues from Lancaster University fitted a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) metapopulation transmission model of infection within and between major Chinese cities to the daily number of confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Chinese cities and cases reported in other countries/regions, using an assumption of Poissondistributed daily time increments. They determined the R 0 to be around 3.1 [17] . Majumder and colleagues at Boston Children's Hospital used Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model to estimate R 0 to be between 2.0 and 3.3 [18] . A large group of researchers from multiple institutes led by Jianhong Wu from York University proposed a more general deterministic SEIR compartmental model using more parameters, and arrived at a much higher R 0 number of 6.47 [19] . Li and colleagues analyzed data on the first 425 confirm cases in Wuhan and found that R 0 to be 2.2, without specifying their modelling method [15] .

Figure 1b shows that the virus is spreading at an exponential speed after 16th January 2020, evident from the number of confirmed cases increases linearly with log scale. Using a single-term exponential model, we yielded a high R 2 value of 0.95. The exponent is 0.38, meaning that the infected population doubles in size around every 1.8 days. A divergence from the exponential fit is observed at the data point on the 31st January 2020, and we expect further divergence in the future, due to the effect of the new quarantine measures starting to take place.",

The team's new analysis was based on a model, the outbreak boundary control decision support framework, released last December, which integrates the dynamics of the outbreak and outbreak control of the new coronavirus pneumonia into a decision support tool to facilitate border control in the early stages of an outbreak to mitigate further spread. The team used a random set of population epidemic simulation tools to simulate the dynamics of the epidemic, and considered the border protection mechanism (immigration inspection) in the modeling process, which is mainly used to identify infected people or high-risk groups [23] . The aggregation population model is mainly constructed based on the population network, which is divided into urban and intercity parts, and the edge of the network is the air line between different cities. At each node of the network, the researchers used a discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model to simulate the dynamics of an outbreak. The researchers were able to observe a lot of interesting information from the model, which ran from the start of the outbreak until 25th January. Specifically, the researchers estimated that as of 25th January, 40 cases of 2019-NCoV had been exported from China. At the same time, the team estimated that the number of 2019-nCoV cases in China may have been much higher than reported for the whole of January, up to about 20,000 cases of 2019-nCoV in the country as of 25th January 25 (the number reported at the time was nearly 2000). Researchers also estimated that hundreds of people in Wuhan were infected in early December. The model is, however, limited by many factors, as explained by the team on their blog post. They are primarily due to the numbers being used are conservative estimates, the transmission of 2019-nCoV, such as the R 0 value and incubation period, being uncertain, asymptomatic infections are not covered and only air travel was included [23] .",

The categories of the severity of 2019-nCoV infection are very different in two guidelines. The WHO guideline shows five levels of severity: mild, severe, acute respiratory distress, sepsis, and septic shock. It covers both the adult and child age groups. The children one is from < 2 months to 5 years old. From mild to acute respiratory distress levels, the respiratory rate and SpO 2 are two important parameters for judging patients' clinical condition. For sepsis in adults, the patients' mental, circulating, and respiratory parameters are recommended to rank the severity; while in children, the definition of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are used. In the septic shock adult patients, hypotension in adults is a substantial sign or vasopressor maintenance for mean atrial pressure \u2265 65 mmHg with lactate level > 2 mmol/L. In the septic shock for children, the criteria are based on the guideline of hemodynamic support of paediatric and neonatal Septic Shock from the American College of Critical Care Medicine [30] .",

But what we know so far can shed some light on the characteristics of the virus, and offer some instructions on dealing with the rapidly growing pandemic. China's health authorities and the government have been moving quickly. In response to the spreading virus, isolation strategy has been used. Many cities including Wuhan have been put on quarantine since 23rd January, 2020, when millions of Chinese traditionally travel due to Lunar New Year. Planes, trains, ferries, subways, and buses cease operation, and roads in and out of the cities were closed. Residents were encouraged to wear masks in public. Many places that usually attract a large crowd, such as cafes, bars, and cinemas in many cities, Disneyland in both Shanghai and Hongkong, Forbidden City in Beijing, are now closed until further notice. We will not know for some time the consequences of the quarantine measures.",

More reliable and accurate R 0 value should appear as more information comes to light. We calculated that the number Table 3 Summary of managements of confirmed infections after 16th January 2020 grows at an exponential rate, with a doubling time of 1.8 days. This result is significantly different from the doubling time of 7.4 days found in Li's group, which was obtained from analyzing the cases before 4th January 2020. This might be due to several factors: at early stages, the lack of awareness for the disease and lack of detection methods would have hindered the disease detection and confirmation. Low number of confirmed cases would result in high uncertainty of the calculation. At later stages, the increase in availability of PCR test kits and other clinical resources would result in higher confirmation rate than the true value.",

Chen and colleagues found a greater number of men than women in the 99 cases of 2019-nCoV which they reported. In previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, men were also more likely to be infected than women [32] . This may have to do with the important role that both woman's X chromosomes and sex hormones play in the body's immune system [33] .

SpO 2 and respiration rate check became very important in the clinical practice. Mechanical ventilation is a major treatment of it, and it has been recommended in both guidelines. The low tidal volume, plateau pressure limitation, no oscillatory ventilation, and prone position have been evidenced as high proof [34] . The anti-virus medicine is recommended in the Chinese 4th edition. A recent publication reported 99 cases in Jinyin-Tan hospital were given anti-virus medicine such as oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h, orally), ganciclovir (0.25 g every 12 h, intravenously), and lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (500 mg twice daily, orally), and the influence of the outcome has been mentioned in detail [32] . Short-term corticosteroids use is recommended in the Chinese 4th edition, the aim of which is to reduce the self-damage by over-reactive immune response. Antibiotic use is recommended when the patient has evidence of bacterial infection. Some patients in the 99 cases presented a rapid progress to ARDS, and the benefits of short-term use of methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg per day and intravenous immunoglobulin were observed in these patients [32] .
