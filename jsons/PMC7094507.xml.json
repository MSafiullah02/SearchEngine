            "text": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) in man is characterized by restrictive filling and reduced diastolic volume of either or both ventricles, with normal or near-normal systolic function and wall thickness (Richardson et al., 1996). A variety of specific pathological processes can cause RCM, including endomyocardial scarring, myocardial fibrosis or infiltrative disorders (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001). These conditions are divided into two distinct groups in man: those with predominant endocardial involvement (endomyocardial form) and others with predominant myocardial involvement (myocardial form) (Gallo and d'Amati, 2001). This classification of RCM also appears to be applicable to cats (Ferasin et al., 2003, Fox, 2004) and the endomyocardial type, also known as endomyocardial fibrosis, is the most prevalent form of feline RCM (Bond and Fox, 1984, Kimura et al., 2016).",

This process primarily affects the left ventricle (LV) or, rarely, both ventricles. There are two basic morphological patterns of endocardial fibrosis, although a degree of overlap in features may occur (Fox, 2004). In the first pattern, the LV shows diffuse, marked fibrosis, which appears as an opaque, white\u2013grey, firm covering involving substantial portions of the left ventricular cavity. In the second pattern, large trabecular or irregular broad bands are observed bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum (VS) and often causing fixed stenosis or a fibrotic tube in the mid to apical left ventricular chamber. This is the most common form reported in cats with endomyocardial RCM (Fox, 2004).",

A total of 327 necropsy examinations were performed on cats with heart disease, and 41 cats were diagnosed as having the endomyocardial form of RCM. In these cases, the diagnosis was based on characteristic gross features of marked fibrosis focally or diffusely involving the endocardium of the LV. The hallmark gross findings included an enlarged heart with marked left atrial and often right atrial dilation and hypertrophy; severe and extensive endocardial fibrosis, frequently bridging the left ventricular free wall and VS; left ventricular hypertrophy commonly associated with wall and chamber deformity; and mural thrombi in the left atrium (LA) or LV (Fox, 1999, Fox, 2004).",

After fixation, the ventricles were sliced transversely into serial sections approximately 5 mm thick, from the mitral valve to the cardiac apex. Each transverse ventricular slice was embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned (5 \u03bcm) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Selected sections were also stained with Masson's trichrome for collagen fibres, elastic van Gieson for elastic fibres and alcian blue (pH 2.5) and toluidine blue for acidic glycosaminoglycans.

Screening for a total of six viruses, including feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), was carried out according to their prevalence, and the feline \u03b2-actin gene (ACTB) was selected as a positive control. Primer pairs and TaqMan probes labelled with the reporter dye FAM at the 5\u2032 end and fluorescent dye TAMRA at the 3\u2032 end for FHV, FPLV, FIV and FeLV were designed on the basis of the published sequences (Dieter et al., 1999, V\u00f6gtlin et al., 2002, Ravi et al., 2005, Andr\u00e9 et al., 2013). New primer\u2013probe sets for FCV, FCoV and ACTB were designed to amplify the conserved region of each genome using PrimeQuest\u2122 software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa, USA). All primer sequences, target gene names and Genbank accession numbers are listed in Table 1\n. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using a LightCycler\u00ae Nano (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and a one-step PrimeScript\u2122 RT-PCR kit (TAKARA Biotech, Shiga, Japan). Nuclease-free water was used for negative controls in each run. The thermal cycling conditions were the same as those described previously (Tsuchiaka et al., 2016).",

Thereafter, the clinical and morphological features of the abnormality were assessed systematically and reported as a distinct disease entity in 1980 by Liu and Tilley.

In addition, the number of cat hearts with type 1 lesions was much lower than the number with type 2 and 3 lesions. Considering the degree of fibrous tissue maturation in each lesion type, it is very likely that the type 1 lesion is an early form of this abnormality, which usually progresses to the more mature type 2 and 3 forms with age. The gradations of the endocardial lesions, the presence of intermediate cases, and the age relationship appear to indicate that the endomyocardial form of feline RCM develops after birth and progresses gradually with age.

Furthermore, the presence of PDGF and TGF-\u03b2 was confirmed immunohistochemically. It is well known that these growth factors regulate the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and their synthesis of extracellular matrix, leading to the development of arteriosclerotic intimal lesions (Gotlieb and Silver, 2001). Therefore, it is considered that the proliferation of pre-existing mesenchymal cells, which are capable of undergoing smooth muscle differentiation, cause or contribute to the formation of endocardial lesions in the endomyocardial form of feline RCM.",

The patchy lesions appeared as single or multiple large trabecular bands or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular lumen, usually from the anterior and/or posterior PMs to the VS. Histologically, the fibrous bands invariably included multiple LVFTs around which mesenchymal cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and delicate collagen fibrils. These observations suggest that LVFTs provide a framework for the formation of fibrous bands, and it is noteworthy that a pathological condition associated with abnormal diffuse networks of LVFTs (referred to as \u2018excessive moderator bands\u2019) has been reported in 21 cats with heart failure (Liu et al., 1982). The increased numbers of LVFTs most commonly connected the posterior PM or the anterior PM to the VS, showing arrangement patterns similar to those of the trabecular or broad bands observed in the present study. Considering that multiple LVFTs were embedded within the fibrous bands, it is possible that excessive LVFTs are closely related to the occurrence of this type of RCM. Ferasin (2009) believes that \u2018excessive moderator bands\u2019 or \u2018moderator band cardiomyopathy\u2019 are simply lesions associated with endomyocardial RCM.",

Endomyocarditis of undetermined origin has been described as an important disease of cats since the early 1970s (Liu, 1970, Stalis et al., 1995). In addition, parvoviral genomic material has been isolated from a small number of feline hearts with cardiomyopathy (including RCM) and myocarditis, although cause and effect has not been established (Meurs et al., 2000). In the present study, histological evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases. Furthermore, our molecular biological observations using real-time PCR detected no viral genomes in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 cat hearts with this abnormality. These findings suggest that any relationship between a virus-induced inflammatory response and the occurrence of feline RCM is unlikely, but do not necessarily rule out this possibility because the present molecular biological study was limited by its small sample size, the localization of viral genomes within the heart and technical factors associated with real-time PCR. On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether an immune-mediated pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of endocardial or endomyocardial inflammation, and further studies will be required in order to address this issue.",
