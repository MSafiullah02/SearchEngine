Mechanical protection includes the skin; the flushing action of urine or milk washing ascending invaders back out of the body; and the mucociliary apparatus of the sinuses, nasal passages, and lungs, which captures invaders in mucus and expels them by upward and outward motion of tiny hairs on the surfaces of cells and by eliciting the cough response. Chemical protection includes lysozyme, an enzyme in tears, saliva, milk, and other body fluids; low pH, as in the stomach; and the presence of chemicals that interfere with the growth of microorganisms. Finally, many areas of the body contain a normal complement of bacteria, such as the oral cavity, vagina, and large intestine. In these areas, several species of bacteria live in balance; invaders are unable to colonize because of lack of nutrients or production of chemicals by the normal flora, which discourage growth of other organisms.",

Most bitches have a large number of antibodies circulating in their bloodstream, but few of these large proteins cross the placenta. Therefore, newborn pups cannot respond well to infection because they do not have circulating antibodies and cannot generate their own antibodies or activate T cells to destroy invading microorganisms directly. Colostrum, the first milk generated by the bitch postpartum, contains many antibodies. The intestinal tract of newborn pups is capable of directly absorbing these very large proteins for only about the first 24 hours of life; after that time, there is a change in the intestinal lining preventing absorption of large molecules and the antibody proteins are broken down and digested.",

The fluid that separates from the red blood cells, the serum, contains antibodies that animal has produced.

These vaccines generally do not produce a strong or long-lived immune response, and so immunization with these vaccines must be repeated fairly frequently. Modified live vaccines contain a variety of the organism that is capable of reproducing in the animal but that does not cause disease. These types of vaccine elicit a much stronger and longer-lived immune response than do killed vaccines, and revaccination can be performed less frequently.

            "text": "The frequency with which animals need to be vaccinated to allow them to maintain a protective concentration of antibodies in serum varies with age of the animal, the type of vaccine used, and the animal's responsiveness to the vaccine. At birth, puppies have few circulating antibodies in their bloodstream. Only about 3% of the antibodies they need to protect them from disease cross the placenta and are present at the moment of birth. Antibodies ingested passively in colostrum protect puppies until they can generate their own immune response at about 4 weeks of age. Puppies usually are immunized several times, with a 2- to 4-week interval, to ensure a good immune response. The factors that can prevent a good response are (1) our inability to recognize exactly at what time the animal becomes capable of responding to an antigen introduced by vaccination and (2) the presence of antibody from the dam, which will neutralize antigens introduced with the vaccine. Immunization of puppies is therefore a balancing act in which we try to promote the pup's own immune response without allowing the concentration of antibody derived from the dam to fall so low as to risk the pup being exposed to disease without adequate protection. Because there is no good way to know whether or not a pup has responded to vaccination or whether it still has protection against disease from its dam, it is not recommended to expose pups to strange people or dogs much before vaccination at about 8 weeks of age. For most vaccines, it is recommended that pups be immunized at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. Some people prefer to begin vaccinating their pups at 6 weeks of age; the manufacturer's recommendation always should be followed. The occasional puppy does not respond to vaccination; measurement of antibody concentration in serum 2 weeks after the final vaccination in the series may allow a veterinarian to determine whether the puppy is adequately protected or should receive another vaccination before the annual booster as an adult.",

However, every study varies in its definition of \u201cadequate,\u201d and few studies test their definition by exposing the animals to disease and seeing what number get sick. That makes it impossible to draw blood from an individual animal, measure the concentration of antibodies present, and definitively state that the animal is safe from exposure to disease, with the exception of animals that are tested and determined to have no significant antibodies.

Occasionally the dog acquires the illness from the vaccine; it is reported that 1 in 10,000 to 50,000 dogs (depending on the type of organism used in the vaccine) develops disease from canine distemper vaccine (see Table 5-1). Formation of a mass or localized hair loss may occur at the site of vaccination. Some authors contend that too frequent administration of vaccinations may induce autoimmune disease in dogs, in which the immune system destroys normal body cells, such as red blood cells. In cats, tumor formation at the site of some vaccinations is a well-documented phenomenon. For these reasons, several alternatives to annual vaccination have been proposed.",

An MLV vaccine contains live virus particles that are altered so as not to be pathogenic; however, induction of disease can occur with any MLV vaccine. It also might be that the pup had no passive (maternal) immunity and did not respond to the vaccine, leaving it vulnerable to live virus in the vaccination and unable to fight off the virus because of a lack of antibodies.
