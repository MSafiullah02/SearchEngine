            "text": "Corona viruses (CoV) have been known for decades to be the causative agent of common respiratory problems in both human and domestic fauna [1] and to infect the respiratory as well as the gastrointestinal tract, on a global scale [2]. Among the different strains of corona viruses that are economically important, the SARS-CoV, a human corona virus, have gained much importance in the last few decades as being responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, typically referred as SARS disease [2], [3]. This deadly virus accounted for a global epidemic with about 8096 respiratory infections resulting in almost 10% (~ 775) mortality cases around the world in the year 2003 [4]. SARS CoVs are a group of ssRNA viruses with a characteristic morphology, due to the spike proteins (S) that form the outer \u2018corona\u2019 giving the genera its name [3], [5]. Apart from the spike protein, the overall structure is defined by the presence of the envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. These proteins interact to assist the virus in propagating within host cells. Among these, the E-protein that is expressed in large quantities in infected host cells serves as an essential component of SARS-CoV infection and has been shown to be critical for mediating viral pathogenesis. The E-protein is of particular significance because of its interaction with host membrane and maintaining the membrane curvature and scission necessary for viral propagation [6]. The E-protein consists of short polypeptide chains (~ 75\u2013109 amino acids) with a hydrophobic domain (HD). It can be divided into three subunits: the hydrophilic N-terminal domain (~ 8\u201312 residues), alpha helical transmembrane domain (~ 21\u201330 residues) and a flexible C-terminal domain (~ 29\u201376 residues). The C-terminal domain is specifically essential for viral self-assembly and virus trafficking making a significant contribution to viroporin biology [7], [8]. Therefore, biophysical and structural studies of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV E-proteins are of prime importance to understand viroporin biology from the structural point of view [9].",

The study demonstrated that TK9 self-assembles in aqueous solution and more specifically the aromatic residues in the motif \u2018VYVY\u2019 accelerate formation of the amyloidogenic deposit [10]. In the present study, we now focus on the structural aspect of the peptide in the presence of the host membrane mimicking micelles and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) to understand the biological significance of this amyloidogenic stretch in the viral pathogenesis. Membrane association has often been studied for the initiation of the structural changes, triggering the aggregation of amyloid proteins and peptides in many amyloidogenic diseases [11], [12], [13]. This study, thus, will allow us to correlate the amyloidogenic properties of the peptide in the light of its membrane disrupting activity.",

From our study, we find that this small, self-assembling domain has a membrane directed activity exhibiting a significant binding affinity and structural changes in the presence of membrane mimics. The peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of both lipid micelles but orients deeper into the DPC lipid layer compared to the SDS micelles. The fluorescence based dye leakage experiment suggests that the membrane disruption by TK9 is more pronounced in the case of eukaryotic cell membrane LUV mimics than the bacterial cell membrane LUVs. This highlights the importance of the critical C-terminal domain in SARS CoV E-proteins in morphogenesis through which the virus propagates [7].",

Topspin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin Germany) and SPARKY 3.113 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky) softwares were used for processing and analysing the NMR data, respectively. Two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra of TK9 (1 mM) alone and in the presence of perdeuterated d25-SDS (200 mM) and d38-DPC (125 mM) were performed in an aqueous solution containing 10% D2O and at pH ~ 4.5 [20], [21], [22]. All spectra were acquired using states-TPPI mode with 1024 and 512 complex data points along t\n2 and t\n1 dimensions, respectively. The sweep width and offset due to water were fixed at 12 and at 4.703 ppm with a 2 s relaxation delay. TOCSY spectra were performed using the standard Bruker pulse program (with the MLEV-17 spin lock block) and excitation sculpting being the mode of water suppression. A spin-lock mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiment, whereas 80, 100, 150 and 200 ms mixing times were set for NOESY experiments. Two-dimensional heteronuclear natural abundance 1H\u201313C HSQC experiment was acquired to estimate the 13C\u03b1H chemical shifts of each amino acid residues of TK9 bound to either SDS or DPC at 37 \u00b0C with 1024 and 128 data points at t\n2 and t\n1 dimensions, respectively. The sweep widths were fixed at 12 and 210 ppm with offsets at 4.703 and 100 ppm for 1H and 13C, respectively. The number of scans and dummy scans were 48 and 16, respectively with 2.0 s relaxation delay. Referencing for 1H chemical shifts were achieved using DSS (2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt) as an internal standard and indirect referencing with respect to DSS were performed for 13C chemical shifts [23].",

From the NOESY spectra of TK9 obtained in the presence of SDS and DPC, upper bound distance constraints were calculated from NOE build-up curves with respect to the NOE intensities of resolved ring protons of Y3 (viz., Y3-2H and Y3-3H). We categorized these distances, obtained from NOE build up curves as strong (2.5 \u00c5), medium (2.6\u20133.5 \u00c5) and weak (3.6\u20135.0 \u00c5). A lower bound cutoff of 2.0 \u00c5 was used for all distance restraints mentioned above. Apart from that the dihedral angle restraints were calculated from PREDITOR web server with the help of H\u03b1 and 13C\u03b1H chemical shifts and the predicted torsional angles were further relaxed with \u00b1 30\u00b0 as upper and lower limits for further structure calculation [29]. Subsequently, several rounds of structure calculation were repeated based on the violation of distance restraints, excluding the non-satisfactory constraints in an iterative manner. Concurrently, the conformational structure was also calculated limiting the conformational space for all the residues, the backbone dihedral angle (phi) was allowed to vary from \u2212 30\u00b0 to \u2212 120\u00b0. This served as a control to reduce the leverage of the torsional angle, obtained from PREDITOR.",

Hence, change in the peptide's conformation in presence of the micelles was further studied using the solution state NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 1B to D shows the amide and aromatic proton region of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of TK9 in aqueous solution, in the presence of DPC and SDS micelle, respectively. TK9 in aqueous solution was less dispersed and showed sharp signals in the amide proton region (Fig. 1B), whereas, in presence of micelles, the spectra were more scattered and, broadened, owing to the well-defined conformational change induced by the micellar environment (Fig. 1C and D). Furthermore, a greater degree of dispersion in the 1D amide proton region in case of DPC micelles when compared to SDS might suggest at the subtle conformational difference among the two micellar environments. Thus to gain atomic resolution understanding of the peptide's conformation, 2D 1H-1H NOESY spectra were acquired in the presence of DPC and SDS micellar environments, which were further assigned and used for the structural elucidation of TK9 in each case as detailed below.",

On the other hand, the NOESY spectra in DPC (Fig. 2B) and SDS (Fig. 2C) micelle contained a sufficient number of sequential and medium-range NOE cross peaks indicating the existence of a distinct structural fold. The fingerprint region in both micellar environments contained several characteristic, sequential and medium-range C\u03b1H/NH NOE contacts as illustrated in Figs. 2D\u2013E, 3\n. In addition to the intense sequential C\u03b1H/NH (i to i + 1) NOEs, medium range C\u03b1H/NH (i to i + 2) NOEs were observed throughout the sequence of TK9 namely between V2/V4, Y3/Y5, V4/S6, S6/V8, R7/K9 in DPC, while in SDS only two C\u03b1H/NH (i, i + 2) NOEs such as V2/V4 and S6/V8 were observed (Figs. 2D\u2013E and 3). More specifically, the pattern of C\u03b1H/NH (i to i + 3) medium range NOEs were different for the two micelles, e.g., V2/Y5, Y3/S6, V4/R7, and Y5/V8 were observed in DPC micelle, while V2/Y5, Y3/S6, and V4/R7 were predominant in SDS micelle. Also, V2/S6 and Y5/K9 showed C\u03b1H/NH (i to i + 4) in DPC micelle and no such NOEs were observed in SDS micelle. Furthermore, a number of medium range NH/NH (i to i + 2) NOE connectivity were found throughout the sequence such as T1/Y3, Y3/Y5, Y5/R7 in DPC while none had been seen in SDS apart from the usual characteristics NH/NH sequential (i to i + 1) NOEs. Therefore, it is evident that the number of medium range NOE connectivities were much higher in DPC micelle in comparison to SDS micelles. These data suggest that there is a structural difference of TK9 in the two different membrane environments. This observation was also well supported by the difference in the aromatic proton region in the NOESY spectra for these two micelles (Fig. S1). In DPC micelle, several aromatic/aliphatic NOE connectivities were observed for TK9, e.g., tyrosine phenyl ring protons (Y3 and Y5) are in close proximity to methylene and methyl protons of neighboring aliphatic residues. In contrast, such NOE contacts were absent in SDS micelle, suggesting the relative orientation of Tyr residues in DPC micelles is much well-ordered and packed within the hydrophobic pockets provided by the side chains of neighboring Val residue in comparison to SDS micelles.",

A helical segment is characterized by negative chemical shift deviation of H\u03b1 and positive chemical shift deviation of 13C\u03b1 for four consecutive residues while the reverse trend is a signature of the beta sheet structure. In our systems, all the H\u03b1 resonances throughout the sequence of the TK9 demonstrate a downfield trend in H\u03b1 chemical shift deviation in both the DPC and SDS micelles (Fig. 4A and B). It is also worthy to mention that, the corresponding 13C\u03b1 chemical shift deviations for TK9 were all positive in both micelles (Fig. 4C and D). This pattern of chemical shift deviation serves as a signature of the predominance of alpha helical conformation in DPC and SDS micelle. The standard chemical shift values used herein for simplicity were for the aqueous solution. However, a similar trend was obtained for the chemical shift deviations for H\u03b1 and 13C\u03b1 in case of DMSO and a tri-solvent solution including chloroform, methanol, and water (4:4:1 by v/v). While DMSO best mimics the water-bilayer interface, the latter serves to represent the membrane environment [35]. In either case, a general negative deviation for H\u03b1 and a positive deflection was obtained for 13C\u03b1 over four consecutive residues (Fig. S2).",

In order to calculate the structure in DPC micelles, total 81 distance restraints including 20 intra-residues, 35 sequential and 26 medium range constraints were applied while in the case of SDS micelles 20 intra-residue, 29 sequential and 8 medium range constraints (altogether 57 NOE constraints) were used (Table 1\n). From the qualitative comparison of distance restraints, it is evident that the number of medium range \u03b1N (i to i + 2/i + 3/i + 4) NOE constraints is almost 3 times less in SDS micelles compared to that in DPC micelles; this is also reflected in the trend of backbone RMSD of an ensemble of 20 structures as seen for the two micelles. In DPC micelle the ensemble of conformations of TK9 was well-organized and converged with an average backbone atom (N, C\u03b1, and C\u2032) and the heavy atoms root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of 0.27 \u00b1 0.10 \u00c5 and 0.99 \u00b1 0.21 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the ensemble conformations of TK9 in SDS was less well defined with 0.57 \u00b1 0.15 and 1.25 \u00b1 0.16 \u00c5 RMSD values for backbone and heavy atoms, respectively (Fig. 5D, lower panel). Close inspection suggests that the three-dimensional structure of TK9 in SDS is flexible mostly at the C-terminal end. It is also mentionworthy that the backbone dihedral angles (\u03a6, \u03a8) were assembled in the most favorable regions and additionally allowed sections in the Ramachandran plot for both the micelle systems (Fig. S3). The overall structural backbone in either micellar environment superimposed with the corresponding free conformational structures (without angular restraints) quite reasonably, with only moderate RMSD values (Fig. S4). The superimposed RMSD was ~ 0.18 \u00c5 in case of the structures calculated in DPC micelle. This is in compliance with the significant number of \u03b1N (i to i + 2/3/4) NOEs that were accounted for the structure calculation in presence of DPC micelles. In contrary, much higher RMSD (~ 0.51 \u00c5) was obtained in case of the structures in SDS micelle, again consistent with the comparatively lower number of medium range \u03b1N (i to i + 2/3/4) NOEs used for TK9 structure. These findings thus reinstate that the number of NOEs play a dominant role in determining the convergent 3D structure of the peptide [36]. Apart from that, we also minimized the significance of the torsional angular constraints used in the structure calculation.",

The \u201cVYVY\u201d unit possibly plays a crucial role in the structural stabilization in the DPC micelle: V2 and V4 remain in close proximity to Y5 and Y3, respectively thereby facilitating CH3-aromatic (\u03c0) interaction.

The longitudinal relaxation rates (R1) of the amide protons (NH) of \u201cmicelle-bound conformations of TK9\u201d were relatively short when compared to that of \u201cfree TK9\u201d (Fig. 6A, B). This reduction in the relaxation rates is due to the binding effect of the peptide with the micelles. Moreover, the average \u0394R1 [R1\nMicelles-TK9\n \u2212 R1\nTK9] value was ~ 1.35 Hz and 1.85 Hz in the presence of DPC and SDS micelles, respectively, suggesting that the peptide-micelles complex formation attenuates the high-frequency motion due to the formation of larger composite systems. Similarly, the R2 value of the peptide-micelle complex is increased (negative deviation in \u0394R2) in comparison to the free peptide in solution which indicates that the peptide in its bound state has an enlarged net correlation time (\u03c4c) due to slow molecular tumbling rate in its micelle-bound conformation (Fig. 6C, D, and F). Higher \u0394R2 values were observed for TK9 in presence of the negatively charged SDS micelles when compared to zwitterionic DPC micelles. This trend might be due to the differential binding and relative propensities of micelle bound populations of TK9, which ultimately influence the local motional fluctuation and global tumbling pattern when exposed to the different micellar environments, where the contribution from specific structural alterations are less.",

We observed strong PRE effect for > 60% of the residues, including T1, V2, Y3, V4 and Y5, which exhibited a characteristic peak broadening in the TOCSY spectra for DPC bound TK9. However, residues such as S6, R7, V8, and K9 did not suffer much line-broadening in presence of the quencher molecule (Fig. 7A and B). Thereby, we conclude that the hydrophobic and/or aromatic residues in the N-terminal T1-Y5 of TK9 insert deep into the DPC micelle owing to the pronounced PRE effect. However, the positively charged C-terminal residues, i.e., S6-K9 remains near the zwitterionic head groups of the micelle, and hence were less perturbed by the deep quencher probe (16-DSA) (Fig. 7E). Contrary to this, in the SDS micellar environment, Y5 is the only residue of TK9, which showed peak broadening in the presence of a similar concentration of 16-DSA (Fig. 7C\u2013D). Based on this result, we infer that TK9 tend to bind to the surface of the SDS micelle along the lipid head group (Fig. 7F), whereas it orients itself much deeper into the hydrophobic region of the lipid layer, adopting a more or less parallel orientation in the DPC micelle.",

This phenomenon can be exploited to probe any biophysical interaction of the peptide that would lead to the change in the lipid arrangements of the micelles. TK9 interacts with the zwitterionic DPC micelles much readily, leading to an almost five times greater fluorescence emission of DPH (Fig. 8A) than SDS micelle.

TK9 is expected to be the membrane directed motif of the viral protein that would be responsible for any membrane disrupting function of the same. In this regard, the mammalian membrane mimics (POPC with 30% cholesterol) served as the zwitterionic LUV prepared to study the dye leakage assay and the bacterial membrane mimics, composed of POPE and POPG in the ratio of 7:3 served as the anionic counterpart. The assay was performed with a membrane impermeant dye, i.e., 6-carboxyfluorescein that remains quenched while trapped inside the vesicles due to a possible dimerization of the dye molecules [40], [41]. Thus, while entrapped in the intact vesicles the dye emits only a basal level of fluorescence, being excited at 495 nm. However, any disruption caused to the lipid membranes result in the release of the dye from the vesicle interior, resulting in its dilution and subsequent dequenching, and hence an increase in fluorescence emission intensity at about 517 nm. This property of the dye allowed us to study the membrane disrupting capability of the peptide and furthermore, quantify it in terms of percentage of leakage caused. An increase in fluorescence intensity was obtained with increasing concentration of the peptide from an initial 5 \u03bcM to 30 \u03bcM concentration. A maximum of about 11% of dye leakage was obtained when studying the peptide's membrane disrupting activity against the zwitterionic mammalian membrane mimic, tested only up to a maximum of 30 \u03bcM concentration. In contrary, only 5% dye leakage was caused to anionic bacterial membrane mimicking LUVs tested with the same peptide concentrations (Fig. 8B). The interaction was directly proportional to the concentration of peptide added to the lipid micelles. Nevertheless, this selective disruption caused to the mammalian membrane mimics highlight the peptide's significance in causing host membrane disruption. The preliminary data can further lead to the in-depth analysis of the mechanism of membrane disruption that is concentration dependent.",

            "text": "Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) helps provide thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change (\u0394H), entropy change (\u0394S), Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) and binding affinity (KD) for studying the receptor-ligand binding phenomenon [42], [43]. Therefore, we have performed ITC experiments to identify the crucial thermodynamic forces underlying the binding of TK9 to the DPC micelles. The binding of TK9 to DPC was exothermic because of the downward ITC thermogram (Fig. 9\n). It is also noteworthy to mention that the negative sign of \u0394H (\u0394H = \u2212 3.05 \u00d7 104\n \u00b1 540.4 cal\u00b7mol\u2212 1) and \u0394S (\u0394S = \u2212 76.5 cal\u00b7mol\u2212 1\u00b7K\u2212 1) suggests the process to be enthalpy driven and hence, the hydrophobic, van der Waal, as well as H-bonding interactions, play a dominant role for this binding interaction [44]. The equilibrium binding affinity was in micromolar (KA\n = 4.33 \u00d7 10\u2212 5\n \u00b1 6.7 \u00d7 10\u2212 4\n mol\u2212 1) range and the corresponding change in Gibbs free energy was \u2212 6188.87 cal\u00b7mol\u2212 1, dictating the spontaneity of the process. This binding data is also in good accordance with our NMR and fluorescence dye leakage assay data which demonstrates significant hydrophobic interaction among the residues of TK9 and the lipid acyl chains in the micelles owing to a close physical proximity to the micellar interior (Figs. 7E and 8). Overall, these findings highlight the micromolar binding affinity of TK9 with zwitterionic DPC micelles where hydrophobic interactions play a significant role in binding. The ITC experiment with SDS, however, was not practical due to the significant detergent like frothing behaviour of the SDS micelles.",

            "text": "This study highlights the high-resolution structural perspective of membrane interaction of the TK9 peptide, derived from the SARS CoV E-protein in two different micellar environments. Thus, our study accentuates that the 9-residue short motif of TK9, i.e., T55-K63, integral to the membrane bound alpha helical region of the C-terminal, has a direct functional role in the host membrane identification and subsequent disruption. TK9 readily undergo conformational changes in the presence of host membrane mimicking micelles, as confirmed by CD spectroscopic analysis. The high specificity towards the zwitterionic membranes, compared to negatively charged ones, were seen from the dye-leakage assays that suggest the inherent propensity of TK9 to interact with mammalian as opposed to the bacterial cells. The binding affinity between the peptide and zwitterionic DPC was determined to be in micromolar range as suggested by the ITC experiments, which also revealed that this peptide-micelle interaction is largely governed by the van der Waal forces and is an enthalpy driven process. Further, the high-resolution solution state NMR experiments revealed the amphipathic helical conformation of TK9 in presence of the two micellar environments. Experimental evidence was put forth for the strong association of the peptide with the acyl-chains of the lipid molecules. However, the physical orientation of TK9 was shown to differ depending on the charge of the target membrane. Specifically, the \u201cVYVY\u201d motif of the peptide inserted deeply into the hydrophobic core of the DPC lipids as revealed by PRE experiments. It is noteworthy to mention that this same motif of TK9 had been shown earlier to self-assemble in solution to form beta-sheet rich amyloid fibrillar ordered nano-assemblies [10]. Thus, the peptide sequence that underlies the host specificity and affinity also directed helical conformation in the presence of membrane that leads to the downstream aggregation of the protein units in forming the pentameric [9] structure. Since it is well known that several amyloidogenic peptides disrupt membranes through the self-aggregation mechanism, the aggregating propensity of the \u201cVYVY\u201d motif in TK9 correlates well with the viroporin functionality exhibited by SARS CoV E-protein in host membranes. Moreover, in future, the mutants of \u201cVYVY\u201d motif subjected to kinetics studies on aggregation of TK9 in the presence of suitable host cell membrane mimicking LUVs using in vitro fluorescence based techniques (e.g. Thioflavin T emission assay), can reveal the significance of the 9-residue stretch of E-protein in mediating host membrane association and subsequent cell damage, which are imperative to viral propagation.",
