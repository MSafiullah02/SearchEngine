            "text": "Since the first outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in 1976 in Congo (DR) and Sudan (now South Sudan), it has claimed hundreds of lives and remains one of the most dreadful viral infections in human history (WHO, 1978). At different points in time (before 2014), EVD outbreaks had previously occurred in Congo (DR); Sudan (the region is now a part of South Sudan), Uganda, Gabon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and South Africa. Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria joined the list of countries with Ebola outbreaks in 2014. Ebola is highly contagious through minimal contact with any sufferer and has the potential to develop into a pandemic. EVD outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 90% (WHO, 2014a). In 2014, the outbreak occurred for the first time in four countries simultaneously, in addition to imported cases recorded in the USA, Spain and Saudi Arabia. At that point the outbreak was considered a global public health emergency (WHO, 2014b). It has been observed that, as a result of increased international travel and trade, local outbreaks of infectious diseases (like EVD) often acquire international importance ( Grein et al., 2000). The 2014/2015 Ebola outbreak started in March (2014) in Guinea, later spread to Sierra Leone and then to Liberia. Nigeria joined the list when it recorded an imported case on July 20, 2014.",

The worst hit countries were Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, accounting for 28,616 confirmed cases with 11,310 deaths (WHO, 2016). The Ebola situation in the worst hit countries lasted up into 2016; they were declared Ebola-free in June 2016. In the beginning of the crisis, it was a situation of inadequate capacity and weak political will to manage the transmission of the virus. With the global emergency declared, there were numerous supportive measures, which helped to eventually end of the crisis. But within the same time frame, Nigeria was able to manage its EVD outbreak within a short period. The essence of this chapter is not to focus on the history of horrors and crises generated by Ebola in West Africa, but to focus on the Nigerian example of how the disease was successfully managed, and draw lessons for future pandemics.",

For instance, during the outbreak in DR Congo (DR) in 1995, 80 cases (25%) occurred among healthcare workers ( Khan et al., 1999). In the case of Liberia, the senior physician, Samuel Brisbane, on the frontline of Ebola treatment contracted the virus and died. Similarly, an American doctor, Kent Brantly, and an Ebola doctor in Sierra Leone, Sheik Umar, were infected (Yan & Levs, 2014). In Nigeria as well, the physician, Stella Adadevoh, who treated Mr. Sawyer became symptomatic, hence she was the first Nigerian case of Ebola declared. The second death was also one of the nurses who cared for the American-Liberian. Another nurse who came into contact with Mr. Sawyer tested positive and was quarantined, while her husband was kept under surveillance. Gradually, Nigeria faced a growing number of victims. It was apparent that the health workers had been unaware of the Ebola status of Mr. Sawyer, therefore, adequate preventive and protective measures were not followed. Following the revelation that the American-Liberian (the index case) died of Ebola, the government went swiftly into action by monitoring all those who had had direct contact with the index case. Within a week, the Lagos state government announced that over 50 people were being monitored.",

While the number of cases was still few at this stage, the effectiveness of a control strategy depends on the adherence to infection control guidelines, surveillance strategies and public participation. This was not the right time to contemplate how to avoid an Ebola explosion in Nigeria. Given the Nigerian circumstances (doctors\u2019 strike, open borders, public panic and communal orientation), proactive measures should have started long before the arrival of Mr. Sawyer in Nigeria. The arrival could have been prevented in the first instance if, considering his country of origin, his condition would have been treated immediately as a suspected case of EVD.",

As of August 8, there were 139 persons under close monitoring; they included those who had had contact with the index case and secondary contacts. The figure would have been higher had some contacts not \u201cescaped\u201d monitoring by deliberately moving to other States of the federation. One of the \u201cescapees,\u201d a nurse who was a primary contact with the late Mr. Sawyer, moved to another State ( Enugu State, about 560 km away from Lagos). Before being quarantined again, the nurse had contact with 21 more people in Enugu. It was because of this development that the then Minister of Health expressed great worry that other States (apart from Lagos) might also be at risk of EVD. This accounted for more concern, both in nearby States and in neighboring countries, especially Ghana, Togo and Benin Republic.",

There were protests in Kakuri (Kaduna State) and Emuoha (Rivers State) against situating an isolation center in their communities.

The efforts of the government were applauded both locally and internationally. As for those individuals who had evaded quarantine or monitoring: the nurse who was returned to quarantine from Enugu on August 28 and a doctor who had been treating one of the (ECOWAS) diplomats (who had had contact with the Lagos index case and had evaded quarantine to another city [Port Harcourt, about 612 km from Lagos]) both died of EVD ( Ibeh, 2014). The Port Harcourt physician invariably became that city\u2019s EVD index case. He put many other individuals at risk: when they visited his home for a christening ceremony; when he continued to treat patients at his private hospital; when he was treated by other physicians when he became symptomatic; when, for a few days after his death, many people paid condolence visits to his home; and when the body was deposited in a hospital morgue. It was on August 27 that the case was confirmed (WHO, 2014c). The widow of the Port Harcourt index case (also a physician) became symptomatic; hence, two additional reported cases. This put the number of additional people who had contact with the diplomat and the deceased doctor under surveillance to nearly 200.",

Those confirmed cases, must also have had contact with others in the society, putting even more people at risk for EVD. As a consequence, on August 7, the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) declared a National Emergency on Ebola. The Nigerian President also earmarked 1.9b Naira (around $11m) for containment strategies following an approved Special Intervention Plan (SIP) to further strengthen on-going steps to contain the virus. The President charged the Federal Ministry of Health to work in collaboration with the State Ministries of Health, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and other relevant agencies to implement containment strategies in line with international protocols and best practices in order to curb the threat of EVD in Nigeria. The SIP includes active Ebola surveillance through contact tracing, temperature examination at international airports for outbound and inbound passengers, establishment of isolation centers, procurement of required equipment and deployment of staff. A similar emergency was declared in Liberia, where schools and borders were closed and $18m earmarked to facilitate containment strategies.",

Consequently, on August 8, WHO declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and noted that \u201cthe possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries.\u201d (WHO, 2014b). One of the vital recommendations of WHO (2014b) was that there should be a large-scale and sustained effort to fully engage the community to play a key role in case identification, contact tracing and risk education. In fact, response to the EVD outbreak in the Congo (DR) in 1995 involved house-to-house searches, which helped in rapid identification of cases ( Khan et al. 1995).",

The main drug, the experimental Ebola Serum (unapproved) called ZMapp, was used. When the patients showed some signs of improvement, the affected West African countries, including Nigeria, were optimistic that the USA would make the experimental drug available. Nigeria, through the Minister of Health, made a request for the experimental drug, which, for several reasons, was turned down by the USA. Although there were still pertinent ethical questions regarding the use of the drug, many health experts advocated for the experimental drugs to be provided to the affected African countries. However, the USA argued that, as they were only treating two patients at the time, in the event of serious adverse events, the damage would be very minimal in terms of causalities or fatalities (and related unexpected consequences). If such a drug was widely used in regions with thousands of cases, the situation could be worse. There was still the need to assess the drugs in terms of unexpected events, dosage, and adverse events. More importantly, the supply was still not adequate to meet the demands of the Ebola-affected countries. The sick, who are regarded as vulnerable, were less concerned about possible adverse events since, in the absence any effective treatment, they are likely to die. Most lay people in the affected countries still could not comprehend why such ethical concerns were prioritized in the face of Ebola death toll.",

However, along these lines, the FGN did suspend Air Gambia from flying into Nigeria, since it was the main airline flying passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea into Nigeria ( Adekola, 2014). This was an effort to stop additional imported case. As the number of victims grew, so did the possibility that other countries would also suspend receiving flights from Nigeria. This would have placed a great burden on Nigeria, since it has a huge population flying daily into several countries of the world. Such suspension of flights might have been tantamount to \u201csocioeconomic sanction\u201d and accrued tremendous burden on the nation\u2019s economy. Luckily, such a ban was never promulgated.",

Such diseases often attract major news headlines across the world, and thus become a global issue.

The apprehension often moves from the political to the social level (especially at the level of the individual), following perceived possibility of transmissions.",

It is important for the media to shift from \u201calarming\u201d to reassuring and educative coverage (see Ungar, 1998). This was why, during the recent Ebola outbreak, the Nigerian government set up a media center led by the Minister of Health to report the state of the outbreak on a daily basis. Part of the mandate of the media center was also to address publicly circulated information about the virus and to debunk Ebola myths. This is also a kind of rumor surveillance, which is aimed at decreasing \u201cthe potential for misinformation and misunderstanding and to inform the public and health officials about disease outbreaks, facilitate a rapid response, and promote public health preparedness\u201d ( Samaan et al., 2005, p. 463).",

For instance, many in Nigeria erroneously claimed that Ebola is airborne; in Sierra Leone, many relatives aggressively requested for the release of the corpse of their relatives in order to perform some burial rites, not understanding that a corpse can still spread the disease. Apart from this, there is often the problem of self-efficacy\u2014that is ability to self-manage and implement effective action. In the context of Ebola, avoiding social contacts with people suspected of being infected can be problematic, especially when they are still asymptomatic. Contacting EVD is generally regarded as a death sentence because of the unavailability of a known cure at the moment, and the fear of isolation/ quarantine could prevent a number of people from reporting their status, suspicion or risk. In the first 21 days in Nigeria (as previously observed), many secondary contacts \u201cescaped\u201d monitoring, thereby posing great concern/risk to the general public.",

The reason for the persecution was obvious within the incubation period of the EVD. In fact Nigerian President described him as a \u201ccrazy\u201d man ( Odunsi, 2014). The government was also concerned about tracing those who had contacts with the dead American-Liberian. The public was almost overwhelmed with anxiety.

Without any further clarification from Iwu, the \u201cprescription\u201d was circulated across every available means of communication, especially through the social media (Facebook, BBM, Twitter, WhatsApp, Viber, etc).

(2008) rightly observed that most public health emergency plans often rely on physicians, nurses, emergency department support staff, and out-of-hospital personnel to maintain the healthcare system\u2019s front line. Perhaps, if some of them return as volunteers despite the strike, this could be humanitarian enough in conformity with some level of duty of care. A nurse on leave from Emory University Hospital exhibited altruistic practice and duty of care by returning to work to care for the American Ebola victims brought from Liberia. It could be argued that moral responsibility, duty of care and national interest override the right of healthcare workers to strike.",

            "text": "From the foregoing, there is no doubt that the outbreak of EVD (like other infectious diseases) raised ethical concerns; Fear of infection offers numerous opportunities to defy bioethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, privacy, and other human rights-based considerations (e.g., right to movement and association). In the face of EVD, the needs and rights of populations and certain individuals might be breached as a result of disease screening and quarantine ( Smith et al., 2004, p. 2). In the case of health emergencies, individuals have a societal obligation to cooperate with health and other instituted authorities in crisis management. It took the Liberian government some military involvement to curtail the movements of people in some affected quarters. In Nigeria, evading monitoring by some individuals was against public health interest and highly unethical. It is in this light that Calain, Fiore, Poncin, and Hurst (2009:7) submitted that EVD outbreak \u201ccan be seen as a paradigm for ethical issues posed by epidemic emergencies, through the convergence of such themes as: isolation and quarantine, privacy and confidentiality and the interpretation of ethical norms across different ethnocultural settings\u201d ( Calain et al., 2009, p. 7), including the use of experimental drugs, contact tracing and monitoring and compulsory disease screening.",

As earlier observed, Nigeria was not prepared for the prevention of such an emergency. When it was clear that some West African countries were already inflicted with the crisis, Nigeria should have taken some precautionary measures, such as airport screening of persons from those countries. Perhaps the index case could have been stopped and isolated at the airport. Whether in the throes of a crisis or not, precautionary preparedness is always recommended; the instituted capacity to manage Ebola should not be completely dismantled. The swift response and multisectoral mobilization, including information dissemination, were the real magic used to end the Ebola crisis in Nigeria.",
