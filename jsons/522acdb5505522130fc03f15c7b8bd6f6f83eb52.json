As of March 26, national incidence surpassed every other country, and as of April 28 has reported over a million cases. The COVID-19 crisis is exposing the systemic frailties in our healthcare system. More than 78 million people in America do not have access to adequate health insurance [1] . Given that health insurance in the US is typically provided by employers, millions more are at risk of losing their healthcare coverage as unemployment surges. Here we discuss how the pervasive healthcare insecurity in the US hampers control of COVID-19. Further, we argue that universal healthcare would alleviate the cost barriers that are impeding control of this pandemic.",

These measures must be implemented rapidly in order to be effective. However, for the millions of people who are either uninsured or underinsured, concern about the medical expenses that could be incurred delays diagnosis and treatment. While the Families First Coronavirus Response Act recently approved by Congress stipulates that COVID-19 diagnostic testing is nominally free for everyone, treatment is not covered. Those who are hospitalized may face major medical expenses. For instance, the cost of 12 days in the ICU on ventilation would likely exceed US $80,000 [2, 3] , even without considering the additional hospital care before and after ICU admission. In addition to the burden on the uninsured, the under-insured are obligated to pay substantial out-of-pocket sums, including thousands of dollars in deductibles and copays. Although the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act has invested $100 billion into the Public Health and Social Service Emergency Fund for healthcare providers, less than one third of this sum can be used to fund the treatment of uninsured COVID-19 patients. Compounding the crisis, legal action being pursued by the current Administration is jeopardizing the Affordable Care Act, which would lead to the loss of health insurance for as many as 30 million people [4] .",

Many of these newly unemployed individuals will lose their health insurance. Although they are permitted to purchase insurance on the federal exchange, switching networks disrupts continuity of care, which is particularly detrimental for those living with chronic health conditions. Furthermore, the majority of families are unable to afford health insurance upon becoming unemployed, given that more than half of American families live paycheck to paycheck [6] .",

These comorbidities exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 clinical outcomes, including death [8] , as does delay in seeking care due to concerns about medical bills.
