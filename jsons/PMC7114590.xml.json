A recent study by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the prevalence of HAIs in hospitalized patients ranges from 3.5% to 12% in developed countries, and from 5.7% to 19.1% in low- and middle-income countries [1]. HAIs negatively affect patient outcomes (i.e. high morbidity and mortality, and extended hospital stays) and increase healthcare costs [2]. The pathogenesis of HAIs is complex and associated with many factors, including patient-specific factors (i.e. age and medical conditions), medical interventions (i.e. urinary and central venous catheters and surgical procedures) and healthcare delivery methods (i.e. inadequately cleaned, disinfected and/or sterilized equipment) [2]. Additionally, there is a risk for person-to-person transmission of infectious agents in healthcare facilities [3].",

South Korea has a relatively high prevalence of TB, with an incidence of 108 cases/100,000 persons in 2012, which is seven times higher than the average incidence across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries [5]. In healthcare settings, TB is transmitted from person to person, specifically when droplet nuclei generated by patients with infectious TB are inhaled by another person [4]. Emergency departments (EDs) are high-risk areas for disease transmission [6], [7], and are associated with TB outbreaks [8], [9], [10], [11]. Given that EDs are often overcrowded and patients with undifferentiated illnesses remain in EDs for a long time, possibly in close proximity to each other [6], [7], acutely ill or injured patients who visit EDs may be particularly vulnerable to TB infection.",

No between-group differences were observed, suggesting that the distribution of TB cases between ED and outpatient admissions in excluded patients may not differ significantly from that in included patients in the current study. However, when the included inpatients who visited EDs were compared with those who visited outpatient clinics (Table B, see online supplementary material), systematic differences (P<0.0001) were found in all baseline characteristics between the two inpatient groups. Thus, propensity score matching was used to reduce the effects of confounding by the measured covariates [14], in which the matching ratio was 1:2 (inpatients admitted via EDs were matched with inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics). After propensity score matching with baseline characteristics [i.e, age, sex, type of beneficiary, residential area, type of hospital and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)] known to be associated with TB [15], 191,997 inpatients (64,017 inpatients admitted via EDs and 127,980 inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics) were finally included in the study. Within these matched inpatient groups, standardized differences (Table C, see online supplementary material) turned out to be less than 0.1, which indicates negligible differences in the baseline characteristics between the two inpatient groups [16].",

Propensity scores were estimated with logistic regression models in which TB occurrence was regressed according to baseline characteristics (i.e. age, sex, type of beneficiary, residential area, type of hospital and CCI). In particular, to reduce the bias from unmeasured characteristics associated with hospitals (i.e. university hospitals and clinics/hospitals), patients were assigned to clusters by hospitals, and then inpatients admitted via EDs were matched with those admitted via outpatient clinics within the same hospitals. Once the matched samples were obtained, the baseline characteristics of the two inpatient groups \u2013 \u2018hospitalization after ED visit\u2019 and \u2018hospitalization after outpatient visit\u2019 \u2013 were compared. Statistical differences were determined using the Chi-squared test. Balance in baseline characteristics was evaluated by examining standardized differences between the two inpatient groups (Table C, see online supplementary material). TB was categorized into three types: all TB (ICD-10 codes A15\u2013A19), pulmonary TB (ICD-10 codes A15\u2013A16) and extrapulmonary TB (ICD-10 codes A17\u2013A18). Within the propensity score matched samples, inpatients were followed-up to determine the new incidence of TB diagnosis for 90 days from the first day of hospitalization. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were estimated separately for inpatients admitted via EDs and those admitted via outpatient clinics. A stratified log-rank test was used to compare group survival curves [18]. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis with a robust sandwich covariance estimate was used to calculate the risk of TB infection [19]. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the risk of TB occurrence between 15 and 90 days after the first day of hospitalization among inpatients admitted via EDs compared with that among inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics (reference group). All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and the statistical significance level was set at \u03b1=0.05.",

However, there were no differences in the occurrence of extrapulmonary TB between the two groups. Pulmonary TB is a bacterial infection that most commonly affects the lungs, whereas extrapulmonary TB infections occur in organs other than the lungs (i.e. pleura, lymph nodes, abdomen, genitourinary tract, skin, joints, bones or meninges) [4]. Pulmonary TB infection is transmitted from person to person via droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis, which eventually reach the lung alveoli; however, extrapulmonary TB (except for laryngeal TB) is rarely infectious [4]. These results suggest that airborne transmission of TB infection may be a key factor related to increased TB occurrence associated with ED visits.",

However, some studies have considered the risk of infection with other respiratory diseases among patients who visited EDs. In a Canadian study of elderly residents in long-term care facilities, Quach et al. (2012) examined the risk of acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections following ED visits, and found that the risk of acute infection was three times higher in elderly residents who visited EDs (odds ratio 3.9; 95% CI 1.7\u20138.6) compared with those who did not visit EDs [20]. Among children from the USA, the risk of infection with measles was significantly higher among those who visited EDs [21], [22]. Recent research has suggested that outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), are associated with EDs [23], [24]. At the National Taiwan University Hospital, one-third of SARS cases occurred after exposure to an index case (a known SARS patient) in the ED [23]. Infectious MERS was also transmitted from a single patient who visited the ED (index case), and was confirmed in 82 individuals (including 33 patients) who had visited the ED where the index case was hospitalized [24]. Thus, although the medical care systems, ED conditions and occurrence rates of infectious diseases vary between countries, previous findings have consistently highlighted the potential risk of transmitting infectious respiratory diseases in EDs.",

Therefore, there is great concern about the risk of ED-acquired TB infection in healthcare workers [9], [11], [26]. For example, Haley et al. (1989) reported TB transmission at Parkland Memorial Hospital in the USA, where five ED workers acquired TB within one year (out of a total of six ED workers to develop TB within this period) after exposure to an index case (a patient with severe cavitary TB who visited the ED) [9]. In addition, 16 ED workers (out of a total of 112 workers with tuberculin-negative skin tests) progressed from negative to positive skin tests [9]. Sokolove et al. (1994) conducted a questionnaire survey on self-reported purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test results and TB exposure among nurses and physicians working in an urban ED [11]. Of 81 respondents, 25 (31%) workers responded that they converted to PPD positive, with most converting during the first six months of 1993 while working in the ED [11]. In a one-year cohort study of 70 healthcare workers at a university hospital in Lima, Peru, Escombe et al. (2010) found that 39 (56%) healthcare workers were culture positive at baseline; after one year, 27/31 workers who tested culture negative at baseline consented to follow-up. Of these, eight tested culture positive, indicating the acquisition of TB infection [26]. Compared with the general population of Lima, these workers had a higher TB incidence rate of 1.46\u20131.72% [26]. These findings suggest that visiting an ED can lead to the acquisition of TB infection from ill inpatients with existing TB infections.",

However, critical issues that might affect the interpretation of these findings warrant consideration. Of these, one of the most important is the presence of latent TB. Latent TB is a persistent immune response to stimulation by M. tuberculosis antigens without evidence of clinically manifested active TB [27]. WHO estimated that nearly one-third of the world's population had latent TB in 2010 [28], and that people with latent TB exhibited no physical signs and symptoms but were at high risk of developing active TB and becoming infectious [29]. South Korea is considered to be an intermediate TB burden country, where the recorded annual incidence of TB was 97/100,000 in 2013 [30]. It has also been suggested that South Korea has a high prevalence of latent TB [31]; thus, it is possible that TB infections associated with visits to EDs could have been due to the re-activation of latent TB rather than recent transmission via EDs. Clearly, inpatients who visit EDs are more likely to progress to active TB than outpatients because ED patients are more prone to numerous medical conditions, malnutrition, high comorbidity index, low socio-economic status and immunocompromised status [6], [32], [33], [34], which are known risk factors for developing active TB [30]. The NHIS-NIS data set did not provide detailed information about whether inpatients had been diagnosed previously (before 2012) or treated for TB, whether any of their family members had TB, or whether they had a human immunodeficiency virus infection, because this is sensitive personal information. It was not possible to identify inpatients with untreated latent TB or to control all pathways, such as household contacts and the potential risks associated with active TB infection. Furthermore, it was considered that inpatients who were admitted via EDs include inpatients who were exposed to EDs for treatment, examination, diagnosis or other medical procedures, as well as those exposed to EDs while waiting to be hospitalized or to start emergency treatment; however, the authors could not be certain of the transmission routes of TB infection. Thus, the results cannot be generalized to different population, years or types of medical care settings.",

            "text": "The current study applied the propensity score matching method to balance the potential risk of TB infection in the two inpatient groups (i.e. inpatients admitted via EDs and inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics). Nevertheless, as mentioned above, patients who visited EDs are more likely to exhibit an emergency/acute severe illness, and the HIRA-NIS data lack information on several factors that could influence the risk of TB. Hence, the results may be confounded by acute illnesses that increase the risk of TB. It should be noted that it is unlikely that the results are free of unmeasured confounders. Given that there is no immediate host response to infection after inhalation of droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis, and that the responses occurred over two to 12 weeks [13], inpatients with TB diagnosis within 14 days from the first ED visit were excluded, and the remaining inpatients were followed-up for 90 days from their first ED visit. This study also found that there was no significant difference in TB cases between excluded and included inpatients, regardless of whether they were hospitalized via EDs or outpatient clinics (Table A, see online supplementary material). This suggests that TB cases admitted via EDs and outpatient clinics in the excluded patients may not differ significantly from TB cases in the included patients in the current study. The results do not appear surprising, given previous evidence on the high risk of TB transmission among healthcare workers in EDs and within the ED environment (i.e. shared sources of air, prolonged hospital stay, and close proximity to undiagnosed or unsuspected TB patients). Thus, the risk of airborne transmission of droplet nuclei and the acquisition of active TB may affect healthcare workers in EDs, as well as the inpatients who visit EDs. In conclusion, this study found that the likelihood of TB infection was greater in inpatients admitted via EDs than in inpatients admitted via outpatient clinics. These results require confirmation using more detailed data regarding patient characteristics and ED conditions (i.e. the degree of overcrowding and waiting time). Also, a screening test for TB upon admission to EDs or outpatient clinics is needed. Given a recent series of outbreaks of infectious respiratory diseases associated with EDs, the effective and rapid isolation of inpatients with suspected or confirmed respiratory diseases in EDs, and strategies to identify and block possible transmission sources (i.e. contaminated medical devices and specimen collection) in EDs may be necessary to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious diseases, which would also prevent the transmission of TB infection in EDs.",
