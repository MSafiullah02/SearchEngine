In the present study, the dynamic mesh model was used to predict the dynamic change of the flow field in the tunnel induced by the train motion. The DPM model was employed to simulate the interaction between the continuous phase of the air and the discrete phase of pollution particles. Accordingly, the dispersion of sudden pollutants released in the ventilation shaft was investigated. The results show that the submicron particles have a good following performance with the air. The dispersion characteristics of the particles highly depend on the unsteady flow field in the tunnel, which is significantly affected by the piston effect induced by the train motion. It can be concluded that particle diffusion experiences three stages: vertical forward and reverse diffusion in the wind shaft, vertical positive diffusion in the wind shaft, and longitudinal stable diffusion in the interval tunnel. It hopes that the study can provide guides for future biochemical protection in the subway system.",

            "text": "Figures 4 and 5 are distribution diagrams of airflow velocity and particle velocity in the ventilation shaft when the particle source is released for 1 s, respectively. After the pollution source is released for 1 s, the train runs directly below the ventilation shaft. Before the centerline of the ventilation shaft, vortexes appear near the tuyere, where the wind speed is smaller than that outside the vortexes, about 3.7 m/s. The diffusion velocity of particulate matter is also relatively small from the wall to the center of the ventilation shaft, which is basically below 2 m/s. The gravity effect of particulate matter has great influence here. Most of the particulate matter diffuses downward in the ventilation shaft, and the diffusion velocity is greater than the initial release velocity. After the central line of the ventilation shaft, the airflow in the ventilation shaft flows to the outside of the ventilation shaft. The wind speed near the area of the ventilation shaft is relatively high, which can reach 7 m/s. Particulate matter is affected by the coupling force of airflow directing to the outside of the ventilation shaft, which is much larger than the vertical downward gravity force. As a result, the release and diffusion direction of particulate matter from the source will change, and the particulate matter will diffuse to the outside of the ventilation shaft. It can be seen from the figure that the particle velocity in the release source region reaches about 10 m/s, and the direction is directed to the outside of the ventilation shaft. Figures 6 and 7 are diagrams showing the distribution of airflow and particle velocity in the ventilation shaft when the particle source is released for 4 s, respectively. At this point, the train starts to leave the ventilation shaft, and the tunnel is equivalent to a duct with T-shaped tee. Under the \"piston action\" of the train, the airflow flows through the upstream tunnel of the ventilation shaft and the ventilation shaft to the rear of the train. The airflow in the upstream tunnel of the ventilation shaft coincides with that in the confluence area. In the upstream area of the tunnel near the ventilation shaft, the wind speed is large, reaching above 8 m/s. For the ventilation shaft, the flow direction of the whole ventilation shaft is vertical to that of the confluence area, which results in the wind speed in the ventilation shaft section being lower than that in the tunnel. Further analysis shows that the vortex in the tunnel gradually moves down from the upper part of the ventilation shaft to the area below the middle of the ventilation shaft. The wind speed in the vortex zone is small, and the wind speed near the outside of the vortex zone is relatively large, basically above 3 m/s, which is greater than the wind speed of 1.8 m/s near the shaft. Observing the velocity distribution map of particulate matter, we can find that the velocity distribution of particulate matter is very similar to that of the ventilation shaft. With the downward movement of the vortex area of the ventilation shaft, the particulate matter diffuses to the original vortex area and is relatively uniform in the area below the wind wellhead. Due to the small coupling force of the airflow and the short-acting time, the velocity of the particles is small, about 0.5 m/s. At the location of the vortex zone, the particles fail to diffuse into the zone, and there is substantially no particle distribution. In the outer region of the vortex zone, due to the accumulation of velocity in the first few seconds and the higher air coupling force in the zone, the particle diffusion rate is obviously higher than that in other regions, most of which are above 3 m/s. Figures 8 and 9 are diagrams showing the distribution of airflow and particle velocity in the ventilation shaft when the particle source is released for 7 s, respectively. When the particles are released for 7 s, the train gradually leaves the ventilation shaft. At this time, the wind speed of the ventilation shaft becomes larger as the distance between the train and the ventilation shaft increases, and the wind speed in the upstream tunnel is opposite. Under the continuous diffusion of particulate matter, particulate matter has covered the whole ventilation shaft, and some particulate matter has diffused longitudinally in the interval tunnel. Before the release of particulate matter for 7 s, there was no vortex zone with particulate distribution in the ventilation shaft area, which is also covered by particulate matter. Under the continuous action of air coupling and gravity, the diffusion rate of In the vortex region of the airflow, the diffusion rate of the particles is also significantly lower than other regions, and the diffusion velocity is about 2 m/s. In the outside of the vortex zone, the airflow speed reaches 8 m/s. The longitudinal force of airflow on particulate matter is obvious, which makes the particulate matter diffused in this area very fast, and can reach more than 8 m/s. In summary, submicron particles have good airflow follow-up, and the change of airflow field in the tunnel has a great impact on particle diffusion.",

Based on the analysis of pollutant diffusion in tunnels, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) When the train runs in a subway tunnel, the airflow in the tunnel is greatly affected by the \"piston effect.\" The direction of airflow in the ventilation shaft tuyere varies with the change of train position. According to the direction of the airflow, the airflow variation can be divided into two stages: the exhaust stage when the train is upstream or directly below the ventilation shaft, and the supply stage when the train is downstream. (2) Submicron particles have good airflow followability, and their propagation and diffusion are greatly affected by airflow. Where the airflow velocity is high, the coupling force between particulate matter and air is large, and the diffusion velocity increases significantly. In the vortex region where the velocity of airflow is small, the coupling force between particulate matter and air is small, and the diffusion velocity is relatively small. (3) Due to the influence of the tunnel airflow over time, the diffusion of submicron particles also changes with time. According to the diffusion direction and velocity of the particles in the tunnel, the diffusion of the particles can be divided into three stages:",
