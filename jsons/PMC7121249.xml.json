It is worthwhile to note that both the domains of MyD88 are essential for signalling. The MyD88 death domain recruits and activates IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK4) and IRAK1, which are both serine-threonine protein kinases. The complex involving IRAK, TIR of cytoplasmic tails and MyD88 executes two functions\u2014executing the enzymes that produce a signalling scaffold, employing the scaffold to recruit other molecules which are then phosphorylated by the IRAKs. The formation of signalling scaffold is a multi-step process: The IRAK complex brings in the enzyme tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in association with TRIKA1 (composed of UBC13, which is an E2 ubiquitin ligase with a cofactor for Uve1A). TRAF6 and UBC13 together have the function of polyubiquitination. This polyubiquitin has linkages between lysine63 of pervious subunit and C terminus of the next, leading to K63 linkages. The same process can be initiated on vivid proteins, including TRAF6 or the multi-ubiquitin chains can exist independently as free linear chains which can be extended to form polyubiquitin chains, which can bind to other signalling proteins. Further, the scaffold brings in signalling complex that is made up of TAB1, TAB2-ubiquitin binding adaptor molecules, and TAK1-a serine-threonine kinase. IRAK complex phosphorylates TAK1, which propagates signalling by activation of certain MAPKs like c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) and MAPK14 (p38 MAPK). This brings about downstream activation of AP-1 family of transcription factors which transcribe cytokine genes.",

I\u03baB is made up of two subunits\u2014p50 and p65. The binding of I\u03baB prevents the movement of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus from cytoplasm. Post phosphorylation of IKK, the I\u03baB is released from the functional subunit of NF-\u03baB, which leads to translocation of NF-\u03baB to nucleus, where it leads to transcription of genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6.

For TLR9 signalling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, MyD88 exclusively is used as an adaptor protein. The TIR domain of MyD88 employs IRAK1/IRAK4 complex as described earlier. However, the IRAK complex carries out a different function beyond recruiting TRAFs which generates a signalling scaffold. In these cells, IRAK1 can also interact with IRF7, which is highly expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This enables IRAK1 to phosphorylate IRF7 which leads to induction of type I IFNs (Table 16.1).\n",

            "text": "The function of IFI16 depends on the type of cell in which it functions. In the immune cells, IFI16 binds to cytosolic viral DNA, engaging sting and induces IFN production (Unterholzner et al. 2010; Horan et al. 2013; Jakobsen et al. 2013). However, in non-immune cells, IFI16 majorly functions in the nucleus by localising there (Diner et al. 2015a; Li et al. 2013, 2012; Orzalli et al. 2012). A plausible explanation for this is that the there exists a multi-partite nuclear localisation signal on IFI16 and is necessary for its transit between nucleus and cytoplasm (Li et al. 2012). Especially in case of herpesvirus infections, both IFI16 and STING are required for inducing the expression of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (Orzalli et al. 2012). The differences in IFI16 DNA-sensing are possibly due to the cell type-dependent process (Diner et al. 2015b). Prompt responses are required in case of immune cells, and thus, DNA-sensing components localised in the cytoplasm makes more sense, whereas, in non-immune cells, the IFI16 might play some housekeeping functions but additionally may respond to the successful viral infections in the nucleus. Additionally, IFI16 also mounts inflammatory and apoptotic responses to foreign DNA through inflammasome\u2014a multiprotein assembly (Kerur et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2013; Ansari et al. 2013; Singh et al. 2013; Monroe et al. 2014). In reality, the evidence that IFI16 elicits both, type I IFN response as well as inflammation is contradictory, since type I IFNs are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory effect (Theofilopoulos et al. 2005; Billiau 2006; Guarda et al. 2011). Recently, IFI16 was shown to play a direct role in inhibiting the formation of both, AIM2 and NLR family inflammasomes (Veeranki et al. 2011). Hence, it is quite possible that the role of IFI16 in inflammasome responses is cell type dependent and other yet unknown factors do play a role too. Recent evidences suggest that IFI16 and cGAS may function in harmony to execute immune signalling to nuclear foreign DNA (Orzalli et al. 2015). This also suggests that IFI16 is a dominant nuclear DNA sensor, whereas cGAS has auxiliary functions like stabilising the IFI16 to enable or prolong signal efficiency.",

It binds DNA substrates in a sequence-dependent fashion and leads to type I IFN response (Diner et al. 2015a). IFIX expression, like IFI16, is dependent on the type of cell and tissue, thus making it likely that its function varies from one cell type to other (Ding et al. 2004; Haque et al. 2014).",

Stimulator of IFN genes (STING) is one such pathway vital to the mechanism of dsDNA-induced stimulation of type I IFN responses. If a viral dsDNA happens to exist in the cytosol, post entry and uncoating, it activates the enzyme cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) that generates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), a signalling molecule. cGAS contains a protein motif as a part of the nucelotidyltransferase (NTase) family of enzymes, including adenylate cyclase and distinct DNA polymerases (Janeway). cGAS has an affinity for DNA and readily attaches to the cytosolic DNA. This interaction stimulates the cGAS enzymatic activity that leads to generation of cGAMP from GTP and ATP in the cytoplasm. cGAMP binds to both the subunits of STING dimer and activates STING signalling.",

The pattern of DNA sensor expression across different types of cells is vital to define the type of sensor which mediates the DNA primed innate immune responses.

Quite evidently, currently known-well, established, as well as prospective DNA sensors have been shown to counteract herpesvirus infections. The very primary DNA sensor was TLR9, followed by the contemporary DNA sensors. To state a few, the HSV-1 infection in human origin primary MDMs (monocyte-derived macrophages) induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\u03b2, which imitates the response post HSV-1 infection along IFI16 axis (Horan et al. 2013). However, this response is altered when the cell type differs. HSV-1 infection of primary murine dendritic cells (DCs) invokes a type I IFN response with the protein DDX41 involved (Zhang et al. 2011b). IRF3 is known to drive the type I IFN response as well. DAI drives IRF3 activation as well. However, contrastingly, DAI (or ZBP1) is shown to play a central role in inducing necroptosis, post infection with MCMV (Upton et al. 2012).",

As is known, HIV replication proceeds through and RNA\u2013DNA double-stranded intermediate in the process of its RNA being converted to a dsDNA form. Hence, both, RNA as well as DNA sensors, play a crucial role in the detection of retroviral genome upon target cell entry (Solis et al. 2011; Berg et al. 2012; Doitsh et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2010). A recent study, intended to understand the type I IFN response against HIV proved that ssDNA, rather than dsDNA form of HIV, is more potent at inducing the type I IFN response. TREX1 is a 3\u20325\u2032-exonuclease that degrades the unintegrated cytosolic cDNA, making it unavailable for sensing to the DNA sensors. Eliminating the expression of TREX1 leads to upregulation in type I IFN response and was more so in case of ssRNA intermediate of HIV, rather than dsDNA form. Undoubtedly, thus, cell does employ the intracellular sensors of DNA that culminates in type I IFN response. Although the definite sensors involved remain to be defined to date, they sure function through a STING-TBK1-IRF3 axis.",
