            "text": "\nHouttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) is a pungent, heart-like leafed perennial herb native in Southeast Asia. It is called in Thai as Khao-tong or Plu-khao which means fishy smelling vegetable. Despite its unpleasant smell, young leaves of H. cordata are popular vegetable in the Northern part of Thailand. It also has been used in traditional medicine for immune stimulization and as anticancer agent. H. cordata shows a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-hypertension, and seems to have anti-edema, detoxicant, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, anti-purulent and diuretic activities (Lu et al., 2006, Probstle and Bauer, 1992). Additional activities of H. cordata against allergy, anaphylaxis, cancer and viral infection were reported (Chiang et al., 2003, Kwon et al., 2003, Li et al., 2005). Hayashi, Kamiya, and Hayashi (1995) reported that it showed direct inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus type I, influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) without showing cytotoxicity to the host. Moreover, Chiang et al. (2003) reported that H. cordata had selective activity against herpes simplex HSV-2. In the anti-viral aspect, H. cordata exhibited significant inhibitory activity on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Lau et al., 2008). H. cordata also acted as an antioxidant and antimutagenic agents (Chen, Liu, Chen, Chao, & Chang, 2003). In general, the chemical components of H. cordata comprise of six major types, namely: volatile oils, flavonoids, alkaloids, fatty acids, sterols and polyphenolic acids (Bansiddhi et al., 2003, Ch et al., 2007, Meng et al., 2007, Toda, 2005). In the beginning, most of the studies mainly focused on the chemistry of the essential oils which have been considered to be responsible for the claimed clinical efficacy (Hayashi et al., 1995). Recently, Meng et al. (2005) developed an HPLC\u2013DAD\u2013MS method for analysis of H. cordata and characterized its major active chemical constituents as chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-O-\u03b2-d-galactopyranosyl-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-\u03b1-l-rhamnopyra-nosyl-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside, rutin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, afzelin, quercetin, piperolactam A, and aristolactam B.",

The on-line-HPLC coupled with the detection of antioxidative activity using post-column reaction of eluates with free radicals have been reported that they can be successfully applied for the identification and quantification of antioxidants in biological samples (Niederl\u00e4nder et al., 2008, Nuengchamnong and Ingkaninan, 2009). Beside these, a free radical spiking technique also showed good detection efficacy (Shui, Leong, & Wong, 2005). Our preliminary screening of four herbal teas indicated that H. cordata showed high antioxidant activity. However, so far there have been only few studies on the phenolic constituents responsible for the antioxidant activity of H. cordata. The main objectives of this study were, therefore, to screen the antioxidants in H. cordata and to further identify and quantify those compounds using LC\u2013MS coupled with DPPH assay.",

The set up system was shown in Fig. 1\n. Line A; Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) is coupled to a PE SCIEX API 4000 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystem, Foster city, CA) equipped with electrospray ionization interface. The chromatographic separation was achieved by a phenomenex Gemini column (5 \u03bcm, 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d.) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) protected with an ODS C18 guard column, operated at 25 \u00b0C. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (1 ml formic acid in 1 l of deionized water) and solvent B (methanol). The elution program started from 90:10 solvent A: solvent B for 4 min, then changed to 80:20 solvent A: solvent B in 6 min, and linearly increased to 10:90 solvent A: solvent B in 30 min and the ratio of solvent A: solvent B was constant at 10:90 for 5 min then changed to 90:10 solvent A: solvent B in 5 min and was kept constant at 90:10 solvent A: solvent B for 5 min for reconditioning of the column. Mass spectra were recorded within 55 min. The injection volume was 5 \u03bcl. The flow rate was set at 600 \u03bcl/min. The Analyst 1.3.2 software was used for data acquisition and processing. The full scan mass spectra from m/z 100\u20131000 amu were acquired both in positive and negative ion modes. The optimum conditions of the interface were as follows: ESI-positive; ion spray voltage of 4500 V, curtain gas of 69 Kpa (10 psi), ion source gas 1 of 450 Kpa (65 psi), ion source gas 2 of 380 Kpa (55 psi). The interface temperature was set at 400 \u00b0C. The entrance and declustering potential were 10 and 80 V, respectively. ESI-negative; the condition was similar to ESI positive except the voltage was set in negative mode. Line B represents the continuous flow system for antioxidant activity detection. It consisted of an HPLC pump, LC20AD prominence (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), home-made knitted reaction coil PEEK tubing with an inner diameter of 180 \u03bcm and a total reaction coil volume of 100 \u03bcL.

The residence time in the coil is 0.45 min. The LC solution software was used for data acquisition and processing. The polarity of the signal output was reversed in order to obtain positive signals. The system was operated at 25 \u00b0C. Line A coupled to line B with a 24 cm length of 0.17 mm i.d. PEEK tubing by a Y-connector. The eluent flow was split in a ratio of 8:2 between the MS ion source and DPPH line.

Quinic acid and kaempferol at a final concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml were added to the sample to synchronise an antioxidant peak in line B with the MS peak in line A.",

The individual optimized parameters for detection of each compound are as follows. For chlorogenic acid, the transition at m/z 353.2 \u2192 190.8 amu with DP, CE and CXP of \u2212120, \u221222 and \u221230 V were set. Catechin was detected at two transitions. At m/z 288.9 \u2192 245.0, DP, CE and CXP were set at \u2212150, \u221222 and \u221212 V, respectively. At m/z 288.9 \u2192 125.1 amu, DP, CE and CXP were set at \u2212150, \u221230 and \u221220 V. For quercetin, the two transitions were set at m/z 300.9 \u2192 151.0 amu and m/z 300.9 \u2192 178.9 amu. The DP and CE for both transitions were set at \u2212150 and \u221230 V. The CXP was set at \u221222 for m/z 300.9 \u2192 151.0 and at \u221226 V for m/z 300.9 \u2192 178.9 detection. Chlorogenic acid, catechin and quercetin in various concentrations were used for preparation of calibration curves. The curves were generated by linear regression based on the peak area. Analyses were performed in triplicate. Other standards were not available; hence neo-chlorogenic acid and crypto-chlorogenic acid were quantified as chlorogenic acid equivalents and also procyanidin B and quercetin hexoside were quantified as catechin and quercetin equivalents, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was determined as the analyte signal having a peak area equal to three times of that of noise (S/N = 3) using Analyst software.",

This assay is based on a measurement of the scavenging ability of antioxidants towards a stable radical, DPPH. DPPH, which shows absorption at 515 nm, is reduced to the corresponding hydrazine when it reacts with hydrogen donors and this can be detected as a decrease of absorption (Brand-Williams, Cuvelier, & Bersec, 1995). The antioxidant activities of the methanolic extracts of O.\ngrandiflorus, H. cordata, M. alba and V. cinerea were expressed as EC50 values of 217.2 \u00b1 12.6, 341.5 \u00b1 17.2, 874.9 \u00b1 83.4 and 886.9 \u00b1 53.1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The positive controls BHA, ascorbic acid and Trolox gave EC50 values of 4.5 \u00b1 2.1, 6.7 \u00b1 0.2 and 7.9 \u00b1 1.3. The results showed that the methanolic extracts of O. grandiflorus and H. cordata had the highest activity among all the teas tested.",
