Models have been developed for many bovine infectious diseases and these models have been used to investigate host\u2013pathogen interactions and immune responses in cattle. Many of these disease models also have substantial relevance to human infections but a paucity of research tools have limited the molecular characterization of disease pathogenesis and host responses to pathogens (Hein and Griebel, 2003). A variety of molecular and biological techniques now hold substantial promise for enhancing the scope of infectious disease research in cattle and providing the basis for effective interspecies comparison of disease pathogenesis. The present review focuses on the application of microarray technology to the investigation of disease pathogenesis in cattle. Future investigations with microbial microarrays will also be critical to understanding the evolutionary balance between host and pathogen.",

The most commonly used tools at the present time include oligonucleotide microarrays (Fodor et al., 1993, Southern and Maskos, 1994), cDNA microarrays (Schena et al., 1995), and serial analysis of gene expression (Velculescu et al., 1995). Microarray technology has developed rapidly and numerous textbooks and reviews have been published addressing the critical issues of microarray experimental design (Yang et al., 2002), data analyses (Butte, 2002), and the application of microarray technology to investigate normal physiology (Barlow and Lockhart, 2002) and disease pathogenesis (Zamvil and Steinman, 2002). Microarrays have been developed for a wide variety of microbial pathogens, but the application of this technology to functional genomic studies in mammals has been limited primarily to mice and humans. A variety of commercial microarrays are now available for these two species and microarrays representing specific cell signaling pathways or biological functions are being used as routine tools to address hypotheses in basic research and clinical trials. However, there has been a substantial delay in the application of microarray technologies to the investigation of biological questions in species of veterinary importance.",

These investigations used a variety of approaches to analyze gene expression in a wide variety of tissues, including PBMC (Yao et al., 2001, Burton et al., 2001, Hernandez et al., 2003, Coussens et al., 2002, Coussens et al., 2003, Coussens et al., 2004, Tao et al., 2004), PMN (Madsen et al., 2004), macrophages (Weiss et al., 2004), spleen (Band et al., 2002), brain (Band et al., 2002), placenta (Band et al., 2002), reproductive tissues (Robert et al., 2002; Dalbies-Tran and Mermillod, 2003, Bauersachs et al., 2003, Bauersachs et al., 2004, Ishiwata et al., 2003, Sirard et al., 2003, Evans et al., 2004), mammary gland (Suchyta et al., 2003a, Suchyta et al., 2003b), liver (Herath et al., 2004), and muscle (Reverter et al., 2003, Sudre et al., 2003). Microarray analyses of gene expression were used primarily to address a variety of questions relating to normal physiological processes, such as cell differentiation, pregnancy, lactation, and parturition. The majority of these studies were conducted using custom designed bovine cDNA microarrays but a number investigations explored the practicality of cross-species hybridization with human micro- or macroarrays (Robert et al., 2002; Dalbies-Tran and Mermillod, 2003, Sudre et al., 2003; and Hernandez et al., 2003). Cross-species hybridization was explored as a potential approach to circumvent a number of the problems associated with custom designed bovine cDNA microarrays, which included either relatively small numbers of well-annotated ESTs (Tao et al., 2004, Coussens et al., 2002) or much larger EST numbers with limited annotation (Ishiwata et al., 2003, Reverter et al., 2003, Bauersachs et al., 2004, Weiss et al., 2004). Thus, there is a substantial need to develop high-density bovine cDNA or oligomicroarrays for functional genomic studies in cattle.",

For example, culturing cells for 24\u201336 h prior to conducting an experiment will equilibrate gene expression (Lafleur et al., 2001). To understand the effects of cell isolation, bovine primary monocytes were purified by using anti-CD14 or anti-CD172a monoclonal antibodies (mAb) combined with magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). This isolation methodology was selected since it provides rapid isolation of highly purified monocytes (>99.5%) and cell function and viability are reportedly preserved (Miltenyi Biotech, Instructions for Use: MiniMACS and MidiMACS). CD14 was selected as a target molecule because it lacks a transmembrane domain and mAb binding should not initiate cell signaling. In contrast, the CD172a molecule is an integral membrane protein, but it has been used extensively as a target for bovine monocyte isolation.",

Bovine monocytes isolated with anti-CD172a or anti-CD14 showed extensive gene activation after 4 h in culture, but gene expression decreased sharply over time (Table 1\n). Monocytes isolated with anti-CD14 had 30% less gene activation at 4 h, but the number of differentially expressed genes did not decline to the same level as observed with CD172a selected monocytes cultured for 24 and 36 h. Thus, MACS isolation had a significant impact on monocyte gene expression and this effect was not eliminated by changing the surface molecule used for cell selection. Furthermore, a comparison of differentially expressed genes (Table 1) revealed no over-lap in the gene expression patterns for CD14+ and CD172A+ cells.

RNA was isolated from intestinal \u201cloop\u201d tissue (Sample) and adjacent, intact intestine (Control) at 48 h (n\n = 3) and 12 days (n\n = 3) post-surgery. These within animal comparisons revealed that 2.3% (180/7884) of ESTs were significantly (p\n < 0.05 and 1.5-fold change) altered in expression levels at 48 h post-surgery and approximately 80% (143/180) of these genes were up-regulated (Aich et al., 2005). Differential gene expression revealed that a variety of cell processes, including apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell differentiation, had been significantly changed. The absence of genes involved in inflammation and cell recruitment may reflect the low abundance of relevant immune genes on the Pyxis microarray and, consequently, the effects of surgery on host gene expression may be under-estimated for the small intestine. Therefore, a similar experiment was repeated in young calves (n\n = 3) but this time the intestinal \u201cloops\u201d were either flushed with saline containing antibiotics (\u2212microflora) or left intact (+microflora) and tissues were collected 24 h later. Microarray analyses of these paired tissue samples identified 5.1% (406/7884) genes with altered expression (p\n < 0.05 and 1.5-fold change) following antibiotic treatment to eliminate microflora. Thus, each experimental manipulation significantly altered host gene expression, confirming the importance of within animal controls.",

To address this question, host responses to an enteric viral infection was analyzed in the presence or absence of commensal microflora. Again, paired intestinal \u201cloops\u201d (\u2212microflora and +microflora) were prepared in young calves (n\n = 3) and both \u201cloops\u201d were injected with bovine coronavirus. Microarray analyses revealed that removal of ingesta and commensal microflora had a marked impact on host responses at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 1\nA). Only 196 of the differentially expressed genes (p\n < 0.2) were common to both experimental systems and a more stringent analysis (p\n < 0.05) of the data reduced this number to 63. Furthermore, over 4-fold more genes were differentially expressed in the small intestine when coronavirus infection occurred in the presence of ingesta and commensal microflora. These observations provide substantial evidence for a significant interaction between intestinal microflora and the mucosal epithelium and immune system. Thus, surgical manipulations and microflora must be carefully considered when designing and performing functional genomic analyses of host\u2013pathogen interactions at mucosal surfaces.",

Preliminary validation studies of these genes using quantitative real-time PCR (Table 2\n) indicate that approximately 75% of the genes tested by PCR concur with the microarray results and this validation efficiency remains relatively constant despite reducing the stringency of the significance cutoffs used for microarray analysis.

            "text": "The relation of microarray data to biology is complicated when using RNA isolated from tissues. For example, both rotavirus and coronavirus infection result in substantial destruction of mucosal epithelial cells. In addition, the immune cell populations in the intestine can change rapidly in response to infection. Thus, apparent changes in gene expression may simply reflect the altered abundance of mucosal epithelial cells or changes in the relative cellular composition of the mucosal immune system. One approach to tackling the limitations of studying gene expression in complex tissues is to study in parallel differential gene expression in a specific cell population in an in vitro model. Using this combined approach, a primary bovine intestinal epithelial cell line was developed to assess bovine rotavirus infection. Primary jejunal epithelial cell cultures were infected with bovine rotavirus and RNA was isolated at 16 h post-infection. Microarray analyses revealed that a total of 1914 genes were differentially expressed (p\n < 0.2 and 1.2-fold change) in the epithelial cells following viral infection (Fig. 1C; in vitro). More importantly, 279 of the differentially expressed genes were common to the set of genes identified in bovine rotavirus infected intestinal \u201cloops\u201d (Fig. 1C; in vivo). This is important since the in vitro model not only provides independent confirmation of the in vivo observations, but also provides evidence to link expression of specific genes to mucosal epithelial cells. Thus, a combination of in vitro and in vivo models can provide powerful tools to enhance functional genomic analyses and associate gene expression with specific cell types. Furthermore, the comparative analysis of gene expression induced by two or more enteric pathogens provides a strategy for the identification of conserved mucosal responses that may be of broad relevance to disease protection. These analyses should also reveal innate immune responses that play a pivotal role in determining the outcome of host\u2013pathogen interactions.",

These observations have implicated stress as a significant factor that can compromise host defenses and increase disease susceptibility. To date, it has been difficult to quantify stress responses and determine what adaptation period is required to eliminate the effects of stress when studying host responses to infectious disease.

Two groups of calves were housed in a single pen with one group of suckling calves (n\n = 8) removed from their dams 24 h prior to bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) infection (abrupt weaning) and a second group removed from their dams and fed hay and grain for 2 weeks prior to viral challenge (pre-conditioned). RNA was extracted from PBMC collected prior to infection and 4 days following BHV-1 respiratory infection and microarray analysis performed relative to a reference RNA (5 \u03bcg RNA aliquots pooled from all PBMC samples). Microarray analyses revealed that both groups of calves shared common transcriptional responses (22 ESTs; p\n < 0.05 and 1.5-fold change) on day 4 post-infection but. it was also apparent that abrupt weaning and pre-conditioning had a marked effect on host responses to a respiratory infection. There was almost 3-fold more changes in gene expression (39 ESTs) (p\n < 0.05 and 1.5-fold change) in calves that experienced the stress of abrupt weaning and transport immediately prior to infection. Thus, to minimize variability in gene expression it is critical that changes in management or diet be carefully controlled when performing functional genomic experiments. It is also apparent that microarray analyses may provide a powerful tool to determine how stress can compromise innate immunity and disease resistance.",

Furthermore, it has become apparent that the activation of many innate immune responses is regulated by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that recognize specific structural motifs of pathogen-associated molecules. An important family of PRR is the toll-like receptors (TLR) which recognize a wide variety of viral, bacterial and fungal molecules. Understanding the role of TLR in the regulation of innate immunity is critical for a full understanding of host responses to infectious disease. Microarray analysis of differential gene expression following exposure of dendritic cells to specific pathogens and pathogen-associated molecules has been an effective approach to understanding the induction of both innate and adaptive immune responses (Huang et al., 2001).",

The LPS\u2013CD14 complex then binds to TLR4 which initiates the intracellular signaling that leads to an inflammatory response (Hemmi et al., 2000).

The RLS technique has several advantages over fluorescence based techniques for microarray studies, including increased sensitivity, better signal to noise ratio, no photobleaching (so arrays can be repeatedly scanned), and no need for dye swapping. RLS was used throughout our microarray analyses and resulted in a substantially increased detection of differentially expressed genes when compared to fluorescence (Fig. 2\n).
