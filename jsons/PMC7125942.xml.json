This gives rise to two fractions: a Con A-binding fraction (SsCBF) and a Con A-nonbinding fraction (SsNBF). The SsCBF fraction was tested using ELISA for the diagnosis of human sporotrichosis and reacted specifically with 100% of the sera from patients with cutaneous sporotrichosis (Penha and Lopes-Bezerra, 2000). More recently, the same group tested the SsCBF fraction, by ELISA, against different clinical presentations of sporotrichosis (lymphocutaneous, fixed, disseminated, and extracutaneous forms) and found high levels of specificity and sensitivity (Bernardes-Engemann et al., 2005, Bernardes-Engemann et al., 2009). This specificity was correlated with the presence in the SsCBF antigen of epitopes comprised of O-linked mannose-containing oligosaccharides with non-reducing ends of \u03b1-L-Rha 1 > 4 \u03b1-D-GlcA and \u03b1-L-Rha 1 > 4 [\u03b1-L-Rha 1 > 2]\u03b1-D-GlcA (Lopes-Alves et al., 1994).",

To confirm the infection by S. schenckii, samples of lesions were collected, after local anesthesia, by a swab of cutaneous or mucosal lesions and/or biopsy (Schubach et al., 2004). The biological samples were inoculated into Sabouraud-dextrose agar (DIFCO) plus chloranfenicol and Mycobiotic agar (DIFCO) and incubated at 25 \u00b0C to isolate the S. schenckii in culture. The dimorphism was observed by conversion at 37 \u00b0C in Brain Heart Infusion agar (DIFCO). During consultation, blood was collected by vein puncture, and then stored in an incubator for 1 h; serum was obtained by centrifugation and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C, until needed. These 30 sera from cats with proven sporotrichosis are now referred to as \u201cpositive sera\u201d (sera from cats with active sporotrichosis). The control group (negative sera) was composed of 22 sera from healthy feral cats from the Zoonosis Municipal Center of S\u00e3o Paulo city. These animals were examined by a veterinarian and were considered apparently healthy with no evidence of sporotrichosis or other diseases. They were housed in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 1996. Also, 20 sera from cats with other pathologies were studied to verify cross-reactions: Feline Infectious Peritonitis \u2013 coronavirus (5 sera), Feline Leukemia Virus \u2013 Felv (3 sera), Feline Immunodeficiency Virus \u2013 Fiv (2 sera), Leptospirosis (3 sera), Ricketsiosis (2 sera), Elichiosis (3 sera), and Leishmaniasis (2 sera).",

The natural habitat of many pathogenic fungi is soil animals exposed to fungi may produce only a mild or undetectable immune response and in many cases, clinical disease is not evident. In the last three decades, domestic cats have been recognized in the transmission of sporotrichosis to man (Read and Sperling, 1982, Dunstan et al., 1986a, Dunstan et al., 1986b, Larsson et al., 1989, Reed et al., 1993, Werner and Werner, 1994, Schubach and Schubach, 2000). Since S. schenckii is a saprophyte found in soil and on plants, cats can be easily infected; the fungus is inoculated subcutaneously by implantation of spores in penetrating wounds caused by a thorn or splinter. Recently, Barros et al. (2004) reported the largest epidemic of sporotrichosis due to zoonotic transmission was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; over 6 years, 1503 cats, 64 dogs, and 759 humans had a diagnosis that was confirmed by the isolation of S. schenckii in culture (Lima Barros et al., 2001, Barros et al., 2003, Schubach and Schubach, 2000, Schubach et al., 2004). This sporotrichosis epidemic was described in areas with underprivileged socio-economic conditions and precarious health services (Barros et al., 2004, Schubach and Schubach, 2000, Schubach et al., 2004). Among the cats with sporotrichosis in this study, five were housed indoors; although, they could have had some contact with the environment or with cats with the mycosis. In our study, only cats with lesions that resulted in positive cultures for S. schenckii were considered as having sporotrichosis.",

We believe these reactions occurred because the cats had prior contact with the fungus in nature. These animals live free in the outskirts of the city and had likely previously encountered the fungus, and produced a humoral response against S. schenckii antigenic components. On the other hand, other mycoses were not diagnosed in these animals. If they were infected by another fungus, they could present cross-reactivity in serological tests. This raises the question if an acute case of sporotrichosis might be impaired. From our point of view, sporotrichosis is suspected in felines only when lesions are observed in the skin or mucosa. In this situation, antibodies are produced over the time necessary for the lesion to develop in a higher quantity than when subclinical infection occurs due to contact with the fungus in nature.",

            "text": "In our opinion, both antigens presented very good results and this ELISA is a relatively simple and rapid assay for assessing infection by S. schenckii in cats. The use of a purified antigen such as the SsCBF molecule allows for better standardization than the use of crude preparations, but the choice of the antigen depends on the facilities found in each laboratory. In the case of the purified SsCBF antigen, only one epitope is the target for antibody recognition, while in the case of the crude exoantigens, many molecules and epitopes are involved in the antibody detection. Recently, Bernardes-Engemann et al. (2009) showed that SsCBF obtained from different isolates present different reactivity in ELISA assay and the isolate 1099-18 proved to be a more accurate diagnostic tool for the serodiagnosis of sporotrichosis. At this moment, there are no comparative studies for CWPR molecules in ELISA. On the other hand, a serological reaction involving crude antigens depends on the antigenic composition of the batch of the respective isolate. In the present study, the S. schenckii crude antigens (strain #118) performed well, but in a recent publication we described the great antigen variability among 23 S. schenckii isolates from different Brazilian regions (Fernandes et al., 2009). This variability in antigen composition may certainly affect an ELISA result. Therefore, a consensus among the scientific community working on the serology of sporotrichosis is necessary so that the same strain is used for serological studies, allowing results to be compared. Alternatively, a regional strain is used for this purpose. However, the traditional culture method is time-consuming, requiring at least a week for the initial growth of the fungus and the subsequent micro-morphological identification. Further, the simpler ID test showed less sensitivity. Thus, this ELISA test may be used in conjunction with more traditional diagnostic methods for the diagnosis of cat sporotrichosis.",
