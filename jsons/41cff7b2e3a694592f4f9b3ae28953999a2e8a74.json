Swift government response to contain the outbreak requires accurate and continuous census of the infected population, particularly with regards to viral carriers without severe symptoms. We take on this task by converting the symptom onset time distribution, which we calibrated, into the percentage of the latent, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic groups through a novel mathematical procedure. We then estimate the reduction of the basic reproduction number 0 under specific disease control practices such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and staying at home. When these measures are implemented in parallel, their effects on 0 multiply. For example, if 70% of the general public wear masks and contact tracing is conducted at 60% efficiency within a 4-day time frame, epidemic growth will be flattened in the hardest hit countries. Finally, we analyze the bell-shaped curves of epidemic evolution from various affected regions and point out the significance of a universal decay rate of \u22120.32/day in the final eradication of the disease.",

However, disease transmission by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers is much harder to deal with due to its hidden nature (5) . Clinical data reveals that viral load becomes significant before the symptom onset (6) (7) (8) . The epidemiological investigation has identified cases of pre-symptomatic transmission based on the onset time interval studies (9) (10) (11) (12) . Estimates vary greatly among experts on the percentage of total transmission due to this group of viral carriers, ranging from as low as 18% to over 50% (13) (14) (15) . A model-based study by Ferretti et al. (16) suggested that pre-symptomatic transmission alone could yield a basic reproduction number 0, = 0.9, close to the critical value of 1.0 that sustains epidemic growth. As the epidemic is driven by the most infectious group at any given period, it is not inconceivable that, as symptomatic transmission loses heat, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission takes over in fueling the outbreak (5).",

The model can provide a timely assessment of current intervention measures and of new policies to change the course of the pandemic. In this paper, we show that such a goal is indeed reachable. By transforming the symptom onset time distribution into the reproductive rate since infection, we build a quantitative model that brings out universal features of individual outbreaks. The model allows one to convert the cumulative number of confirmed cases to the current size of the presymptomatic population. Subsequently, one can estimate the percentage reduction in the basic reproduction number 0 (estimated to be around 3.68 at a growth rate of 0.3/day) due to contact tracing, wearing masks and other additional measures, individually or in combination. Additionally, we present our findings against the epidemic development curves around the world to highlight the level of social mobilization required to prevent COVID-19 from spreading further.",

After some time in phase A, the individual develops symptoms and enters the symptomatic S phase at a rate , independent of how long the person has been in phase A. The mean duration of phase A is given by \u22121 , chosen to correspond to the size of the left-wing of the infectiousness curve. The transmission rate in phase A is set by . Once in S, the person remains in this phase and the subsequent disease development is not followed. Disease transmission rate ( ) is a function of = \u2212 that matches the right-wing of the infectiousness curve. The total area underneath the infectiousness curve is given by",

We undertake this task below using available data. By combining two data sets (11, 23) with a total of 159 infection cases, we calibrated the statistical behavior of the symptom onset time as shown in Fig. 2a , and obtained a mean value = 5.17 days, with a standard deviation of 2.93 days. The data is validated against a serial interval study on 468 infection pairs (9) with excellent consistency (see SM). Starting from day 6, ( ) decays exponentially at a rate of \u22120.32/day. As will be elaborated later, this decay rate is also seen in the decreasing rate of daily cases when the infectious population is fully isolated and can be attributed to the statistics of the latent period . The parameter controls the apparent duration of phase A, but its actual value has only a weak effect on our predictions. In our numerical exploration, we use the estimated value \u2248 0.75/day based on a data set compiled by Xia et al. (11) . The basic reproduction number 0 reflects the regional social contact pattern in a specific period. Figure 2b shows the probabilities that a given individual is in one of the three phases at day t after infection, computed using the formula in Table S1 (SM). The red line marks the boundary between the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic phases. Dashed lines above the red line indicate probabilities that the individual is one day or two days into the symptomatic phase, respectively. The width of the orange region, on the other hand, is proportional to \u22121 = 1.5 days. Figure 2c , obtained from the Laplace transforms of these curves, gives the percentage of the infected population in each of the three phases on a given day when the epidemic is growing at a rate . These curves allow for estimation of the hidden population in L and A from the knowledge of S in real-time and form the basis for quantitative assessment of intervention measures. The actual size of S, which includes all individuals who have developed symptoms in the past, regardless of whether they have recovered from the disease, can be estimated from the total number of confirmed cases until that time point. Note that at high growth rates, probabilities at short times in Fig. 2b contribute more to the Laplace transforms, leading to a larger percentage of the total infectious population being constituted by the hidden population.",

For testing control, persons who had close contact with a confirmed infection case are asked to undergo voluntary or mandatory testing for infection, and quarantined when the result is positive. From Fig. 2b we see that, if the test is conducted too close to the day of infection, the individual has a high probability to still be in the latent phase, hence the test result is likely to be negative. On the other hand, if the test is conducted too late, the person may have already infected others so that the reduction of ( ) given by Eq. (1) is small. Therefore, there is an optimal interval between infection date and the test date, which we analyzed in SM. Figure 3a shows the function ( ) = ( )/ 0 without intervention, and in three examples when the test was performed on day 2, day 3 and day 4 after infection, under the best-case scenario when all close contacts were traced and test results were immediately available. Relative change of the basic reproduction number 0 is given by the sandwiched area in each case. In Fig. 3b , we show the reduction of 0 as a function of the test date after infection for immediate reporting (red line) and delay of result by one day (blue line), with an initial value of 0 = 3.68. The best result is obtained when the test is performed on day 4. This corresponds to the day when the width of the orange region in Fig. 2b is the widest.

Among them, population-wide mask wearing is currently under debate (25) . It is enforced in most Asian countries, but not recommended by the CDCs in the EU and USA as of 31 March, 2020. Given the now established risk of pre-symptomatic transmission, and the dominant role of droplet-mediated COVID-19 infections (26), masks with relatively low efficacy for personal protection may nevertheless reduce the overall infections in a population (27) . Based on a previous study on influenza aerosols (28), we constructed a semiquantitative model to show that mask-wearing reduces eff and hence 0 by a factor (1 \u2212 \u22c5 ) 2 , where is the efficacy of trapping viral particles inside the mask, and is the percentage of mask-wearing population (see SM). According to this model, mask-wearing at 96% alone could flatten an epidemic growing at a rate of 0.3/day by bringing down 0 from its original value of 3.68 to 1. When combined with contact tracing (Fig. 3b) , the two effects multiply. Figure 3c shows a heatmap of the reduced 0 when contact tracing and isolation is completed within 4 days of infection. The solid yellow line indicates that the reduced 0 reaches 1. For example, the combination of tracing of close contacts at 60% efficiency within 4 days and 70% of the general public wearing masks achieves the same purpose. This target line can be reached with lower percentages when close contacts can be found within 2 days of possible infection (red dashed line), but the numbers need to be higher when the time frame is relaxed to 7 days (green dashed line).",

Exponential growth with a daily growth rate of around 0.3 is seen in the latest epidemic data from a number of countries (Fig. 4c ).

Under successful interventions, a few countries have transitioned to the crossover phase observed in China in February (Fig. 4d) . The government of Italy imposed a national quarantine on March 9 (33), after which growth in the number of newly confirmed cases slowed down (29) . On the other hand, South Korea adopted very aggressive contact tracing and testing policies (34, 35) , enabling the country to bring the initially rampaging outbreak to a much more manageable level at 0 \u2248 1 (Fig. 4d, stars) . These countries are now facing the challenge of dealing with import driven growth, which can be analyzed using our model (see SM).",

The effect of intervention measures in a regional or national setting, such as border closing, social distancing, contact tracing, testing, quarantining and mask wearing, can be readily incorporated into the model for quantitative assessment and prediction. In the ongoing battle in many countries, further reduction of the still positive growth rate requires quantitative evaluation of the proposed measures. While the data used to construct the reproduction rate function given by Eq. (1) will continue to be updated, our current predictions should already be informative to decision-makers. As the pandemic is fueled by transmission in the fastest growing community, reaching out to all sectors of society will pose the biggest challenge. In this respect, comprehensive monitoring of the pandemic development will be essential.",

COVID-19 disease progression and transmission: A person infected at time = 0 first goes through a non-infectious latent phase (L) until , marking the start of the infectious period. The infectious period consists of two phases, presymptomatic (A) and symptomatic (S). In phase A, the person is infectious without symptoms, during which the virus can be spread through pre-symptomatic transmission (orange dashed arrow). At the symptom onset time , the person enters the S phase and infects others with symptomatic transmission (blue dashed arrow). The infectiousness of the person peaks around the symptom onset time. The basic reproduction number 0 is split into and , given by areas underneath the curve on either side of the symptom onset point, respectively. Interventions to limit transmission: contact tracing brings an infected person out of the transmission cycle at the point of isolation, while testing is effective only when the person has developed high viral load and is already in the infectious period. Data and model predictions. a, The symptom onset time distribution. Two data sets from previous studies are shown (hollow circles(23) and squares(11)). The mean values and standard deviations are given in the legend. The distribution of the union of the two datasets is shown in solid circles.
