This follows recent, salutary experiences including a variety of severe natural disasters, e.g., Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, flooding, landslides, forest fires (in California) and drought. George Luber, head of the Climate and Health Programme of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been central to this rising awareness in the United States. Luber claims that the climate change has extended the pollen season in some parts of the country by as much as 26 days, increasing the risk of allergy and asthma attacks. It has also contributed to heavier rainfalls, which can jeopardise drinking water quality. \u201cClimate change isn\u2019t just about polar bears and penguins or impacts distant in time\u201d, Luber told The Lancet. He went on to explain that these impacts affect our communities and people\u2019s health, so \u201cputting the human dimension on climate change is vital not only for understanding threat we face but also for encouraging action\u201d (Jaffe 2015).",

            "text": "Developing countries in general and India in particular face challenges to accelerate the pace of socioeconomic development and minimise inequalities, exacerbated during the colonial period. However, even after independence, inequalities in India have risen. India is in dire need of energy (per capita electricity consumption in India is 618 KW and in the United States 14,240) to enable infrastructure development. But there are also gross global inequalities. Most developing countries, including India, have the lowest per capita CO2 emission (1.2 t per capita in India compared to 20.6 t in the United States), as well as the low gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Despite this, major developed nations insist that developing nations reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, fundamental to their socioeconomic development. However, under the Kyoto Protocol, the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility\u201d was considered as fundamental for future emission negotiations. This will promote equity and human development by expanding access to energy demand of developing countries (Akhtar 2010). India\u2019s official thinking on climate change is derived from a policy advanced by Manmohan Singh, who served as the country\u2019s prime minister until 2014. In 2007, he declared at a G20 summit in Germany that India\u2019s per capita emissions will never exceed the average per capita emissions for developed countries. Right now, that gives India quite a bit of elbow room. If the United States and the European Union are able to attain the cuts they are now talking of, India\u2019s leeway shrinks; though some in the Indian government believe that even then the country could continue to increase its emissions for 15 or 20 years beyond the 2030 cap China has agreed to and still fall below the developed world\u2019s per capita average.",

Is there a new emphasis? It would seem not, judging from a recent interview given to The New York Times after the September 2014 UN Climate Summit in New York: Prakash Javadekar said, \u201cThe moral principle of historic responsibility cannot be washed away\u201d (Devenport 2014). This means that developed economies, chiefly the United States, which spent the last century building their economies while pumping warming emissions into the atmosphere, bear the greatest responsibility for cutting pollution. India\u2019s Minister further clarified that government agencies in New Delhi were preparing plans for India\u2019s domestic actions on climate change, but he said they would lead only to a lower rate of increase in carbon emissions. It would be at least 30 years, he said, before India would likely see a downturn.",

After all, most developed countries undertook pollution-intensive industrialization during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that resulted in large cumulative historical emissions (http://www.gov.cn/2011lh/content_1825838.htm).",

The attitude of Chinese policymakers toward climate change policy recently underwent a radical change, from having no explicit climate change policies to a Presidential commitment to reduce carbon intensity. need to control total energy consumption, and to gradually establish a carbon market. We posit that the motivation for this radical shift can be attributed to rising concerns about the projected impacts of climate change in China, and also the government\u2019s recognition that China\u2019s traditional development model is unsustainable, not only environmentally, but also from the standpoint of social and economic development. The Chinese central government has been searching for mechanisms to transform China\u2019s development trajectory, and climate change policy represents a new and justifiable tool that can help the government transform economic development in China, especially because climate policy can be used as a new central government instrument to guide and control the behaviour of local governments\u201d (Xiaowei and Gallagher 2014).",

These include the effects of an increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, a reduction in cold-related deaths, more frequent and more intense floods and droughts, changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases and risk of disasters and malnutrition (Haines, 2014, Personal communication). In another study, Andy Haines and colleagues warned that the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 8.5) assume that present trends of relatively unrestrained use of fossil fuels and high population growth will continue. According to this emission pathway, by 2100 the global average temperature will probably be more than 4 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels with higher average temperatures over lands (Haines et al. 2014). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, the Chapter on Human Health, affirms with very high confidence that the health of human population is sensitive to shifts in weather patterns and other aspects of climate change. The Chapter also projects (1) greater risks of injury, disease and death due to more intense heat waves and fires (very high confidence)\u037e (2) increased risks of food and waterborne diseases (very high confidence) and (3) increased risk of undernutrition resulting from diminished food production in poor regions (high confidence) (Smith et al. 2014).",

Based on this mapping assessment, they identified all parts of the Philippines, the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam, almost all of Cambodia, North and East Lao PDR, Bangkok (Thailand), West and South Sumatra and West and East Java (Indonesia) as the most vulnerable regions (Yusuf and Francisco 2009). Both South and Southeast Asian countries are vulnerable due to floods, with the region experiencing the largest number of events (1171) during 1980\u20132008, followed by storms (930 events). The data from UNISDR show that Bangladesh suffered the most with epidemics and pandemics, with 1500,000 people affected in 1991 followed by Indonesia.",

This vulnerability has acquired a serious proportion when we consider the latest IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014) on Asia. The Report highlights that warming trends and increasing extreme temperature are exacerbated by coastal and marine systems that are under increasing stress from both climatic and nonclimatic driver. The geography of large coastal areas here also makes South and Southeast Asia two of the many places around the world that are susceptible to several different kinds of infectious diseases. Water scarcity is also a major challenge for most of the regions because of rapid and unplanned urbanization, industrialization and select regional economic development by climate change. In addition extreme climate events will have an increasing impact on human health. Frequent and intense heat waves in Asia will increase mortality and morbidity in vulnerable groups. Increase in heavy rain and temperature will increase the risk of diarrheal diseases, dengue fever and malaria. Increases in floods (as occurred in Pakistan in 2010 and in Thailand in 2011 and drought in India in 2009) will exacerbate rural poverty in parts of the South and Southeast Asian region due to impaired crop production.",

In this model, primary effects are considered the most causally direct impacts of climate change on health. They include increased mortality during heat waves as what repeatedly occurred in India and elsewhere in South Asia. In the month of May 2015 alone, more than 1200 people died due to heat wave mainly in southeastern states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, as well as in northern India (TOI 2015). The effects of \u201cnatural\u201d disasters such as flooding, hailstorms, droughts and severe cyclones, all of which are arguably worsened by climate change (including sea level rise in coastal regions), are also considered \u201cprimary\u201d in this conceptualization. \u201cSecondary\u201d effects include via ecological changes that alter the epidemiology of some infectious diseases and chronic diseases, for example, the 1994 malaria outbreak in the Rajasthan desert following from extremely heavy rainfall and flooding (Akhtar and McMichael 1996). The health impact of allergens and air pollution, each of which interacts with climate change, can also be considered secondary effects. Tertiary effects refer to large-scale events with complex, multidimensional causation, including migration, famine and conflict. Unfortunately, all three forms of tertiary health effects are seen in countries of the region (Singh et al. 2015). Heat stress, on a sufficient scale, could also be called a tertiary effect.",
