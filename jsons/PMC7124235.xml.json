Dendritic cells (DC) are the principal MHC class II expressing cells in the normal airway mucosa. These cells play a major role in the processing of inhaled antigens and may participate in the pathogenesis of infectious and allergic airway diseases [2], [3], [4]. During steady-state conditions, DC turnover every 36\u201348 h [5]. However, the DC network rapidly expands after exposure to a variety of pathogens and antigens [6]. For example, exposure to aerosolized heat-inactivated Moraxella catarrhalis causes DC influx into the airways which peaks within 3 h and remains elevated for 48 h [5]. Inoculation of viable Bordatella pertussis results in DC recruitment with similar kinetics but with a maximal cell density at 24 h [7]. Even at the peak of the inflammatory response, DC are the principal MHC class II expressing cells\u2014greatly outnumbering macrophages and B lymphocytes [7]. Such stimuli can also evoke transient expression of MHC class II molecules by airway epithelial cells [8], [9], [10].",

            "text": "Less is known about the involvement of DC and other MHC class II expressing cells in chronic inflammatory airway disease, in part because most disease models have focused on transient conditions. The long-lasting consequences of Mycoplasma pulmonis infection make it useful for studying changes in chronic disease [11], [12], [13]. The organisms attach to the luminal surface of the airway epithelium of rats and mice [12] and are not cleared from the airways despite strong cellular and humoral immune responses [11], [13], [14], [15]. The ongoing stimulus causes an influx of mononuclear cells, including DC, macrophages, and lymphocytes [15], [16], [17], [18]. The development of mucosal lymphoid tissue is a prominent part of the remodeling of the airway mucosa, and is accompanied by epithelial cell and mucous gland hyperplasia, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and increased sensitivity of the newly formed blood vessels to the neuropeptide substance P [13], [14], [19], [20]. Although some of these changes may occur after viral infection [20], [21], M. pulmonis infection is unusual in that it causes life-long disease and, if untreated, can result in severe remodeling of the airway mucosa [22]. The role of DC and other MHC class II expressing cells in these changes is unknown [16], [17], but is of interest because of the rapid cellular response after infection and the strong immunological component of mycoplasmal airway disease.",

Tracheal whole mounts provided a clear view of the number and 3-dimensional structure of OX6-positive cells in pathogen-free rats and during the first week after M. pulmonis infection. However, as the mucosa became thicker, only the most superficial cells of whole mounts were stained, probably due to limited penetration of reagents and increasing immunoreactivity of the epithelium. By comparison, cross-sections, which did not have the limitation of reagent penetration, clearly revealed the thickening of the mucosa and showed abundant OX6-positive cells throughout the mucosa. Together, the two types of preparations revealed that the total number of OX6-positive cells increased 6-fold over the first week after infection and 16-fold over 4 weeks.",

In addition, OX6-positive cells, which are most abundant at the base of the epithelium, can be distinguished from ED2-positive tissue macrophages, which are most numerous deeper in the mucosa [18].

The phenotypic distinction between DC and other cell types blurs after mycoplasmal infection, when multiple cell types express MHC class II molecules [30], [31]. The characteristic branched morphology of DC in pathogen-free rats was no longer present in the OX6-positive cell population 1 week after infection and could, therefore, not be used to distinguish DC from other MHC class II expressing cells. Accordingly, some OX6-positive cells observed after infection may represent activated macrophages or B lymphocytes that have infiltrated the airway mucosa [15], [31]. The exact proportion of DC relative to other MHC class II expressing cells cannot be definitively determined without using multiple cell markers. For example, activated B-cells could be identified by using OX12 as a marker [8]. However, it is unlikely that activated macrophages make a major contribution to the OX6-positive cell population, because in infected animals they acquire a distinctive distribution around angiogenic blood vessels, quite different from the pattern of OX6 immunoreactivity [18].",

In sections of airway epithelium stained for OX6 immunoreactivity, class II-positive cells become pleomorphic about 8 h after challenge with M. catarrhalis and by 24 h develop into mature DC with highly branched processes [32]. Rounded DC precursors are not seen in control animals, and their transformation from rounded to stellate phenotype is most likely explained by local factors affecting DC maturation [5]. In our experiments, OX6-positive cells with a rounded phenotype accumulated in the airways during the first week after M. pulmonis infection. Perhaps the transformation from stellate to rounded phenotype reflects changes in DC maturation, differentiation, or motility. Alternatively, the apparent change in DC phenotype may represent the gradual replacement of stellate DC by rounded MHC class II expressing cells such as B-cells.",

Additionally, OX6 immunoreactivity has been reported in other types of epithelial cells after exposure to endotoxin or IFN-\u03b3 [9], [10], [34]. It is not clear whether the M. pulmonis organisms themselves or perhaps their ability to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 production is driving the MHC class II expression by epithelial cells.
