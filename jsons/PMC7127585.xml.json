Several polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013based tests have demonstrated improvement in diagnostic yield and turnaround times compared with conventional cell cultures and antigen-based methods (Mahony et al., 2011, Wu and Tang, 2009). The EraGen MultiCode-PLx Respiratory Virus Panel (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) is one such assay that couples multiplex PCR chemistry with high-throughput microsphere flow cytometry for simultaneous detection of 17 viruses: influenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus A and B; parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4(a) and 4(b); metapneumovirus; adenovirus B, C, and E; coronovirus NL63, 229E, and OC43; and rhinovirus. Performance characteristics of the test have been previously described (Nolte, et al., 2007), with reported sensitivities for individual viruses ranging from 94% to 100% and specificities ranging from 99% to 100%, when compared with viral culture (Arens, et al., 2010).",

            "text": "A potential limitation of PCR-based assays compared to viral culture is increased detection of respiratory viruses in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals in the absence of respiratory symptoms (Kuypers et al., 2009, Wright et al., 2007). Reported rates of viral recovery from the respiratory tract of asymptomatic individuals using PCR-based assays vary from 2% to 30% depending on the population and test methodology (Brittain-Long et al., 2010, Buecher et al., 2010, Graat et al., 2003, Sato et al., 2009, van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al., 2005), but comparable information regarding specificity of the MultiCode-PLx system (using symptoms as the reference standard) in outpatient URI diagnosis is not available. Second, in the case of URI, particularly pharyngotonsillitis in children, group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) is well established as the most common bacterial pathogen (Hable et al., 1971). Moreover, concurrent infection with a respiratory virus and GAS has been identified in prior studies (Brook and Gober, 2008, van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al., 2005), suggesting that detection of a respiratory virus might not preclude antibiotic use in some cases. A third issue is determining the most appropriate sampling method and anatomical site for detection of respiratory viruses using this assay. In a recent study using multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR, investigators observed an increase in viral detection by combining different specimens (nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal washes) in adults hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections (Lieberman, et al., 2009). In the outpatient setting, nasal and throat swabs are most frequently (and conveniently) obtained, especially in children. It is unknown whether the type of specimen (nasal versus throat swab) affects viral detection using multiplex PCR in URI.",

We detected rhinovirus, influenza A, and adenovirus C in 3 asymptomatic children in our study. Despite the study being conducted during the \u201cinfluenza season\u201d, and influenza viruses being the predominantly recovered viruses in symptomatic adults, influenza viruses were not detected in adults in the absence of symptoms. The phenomenon of increase in viral detection among asymptomatic individuals with the use of more sensitive PCR assays has been previously demonstrated, and the rate of such \u201cnon-specific\u201d detection using the MultiCode PLx assay in our study (7%) was in the lower range of previously published rates (2\u201330%) using similar platforms (Brittain-Long et al., 2010, Buecher et al., 2010, Fry et al., 2011, Graat et al., 2003, Sato et al., 2009, Wright et al., 2007). In contrast, viruses recovered in cell cultures have been associated with ill patients but not with asymptomatic individuals (Hable, et al., 1971). These data on clinical specificity are complementary to data on microbiologic specificity of the assay compared to viral culture and can help clinicians in interpreting the results of such assays in outpatient practice. As in our study, rhinoviruses appear to be the most frequently detected viruses in asymptomatic persons in several studies using molecular assays (Brittain-Long et al., 2010, Buecher et al., 2010, Graat et al., 2003, Jansen et al., 2011). Our data are also consistent with previous observations that asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses occurs more frequently in children than in adults (Buecher et al., 2010, Fry et al., 2011). In some instances, such detection could be due to an individual being in the convalescent phase of an acute illness\u2014e.g., in 1 study, investigators were able to detect viruses from the nasopharynx of children for as long as 2 weeks after an acute infection (Jartti et al., 2004). We were careful to exclude individuals with respiratory illness within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. However, because of the small sample size, specific risk factors for asymptomatic carriage could not be determined in our study. Lastly, a higher rhinovirus viral load (using a molecular assay) was recently shown more likely to be associated with clinical symptoms, and the authors suggested that defining cutoff values should be considered for molecular tests used in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections (Jansen, et al., 2011).",

This finding was particularly notable in adults and is possibly related to the smaller quantities of virus shed by adults compared to children (She, et al., 2010). While sampling both sites is neither feasible nor necessary in every patient, it is important for clinicians to understand the limitations of sampling 1 site and to pursue an additional site if the clinical situation indicates.

On the other hand, co-infection with GAS was found in 4/40 (10%) symptomatic cases. Furthermore, clinical suspicion for GAS leading to either testing or treatment occurred in only 1 of those 4 patients. This would suggest that a testing strategy that combines the use of a rapid GAS test with a rapid viral diagnostic might be necessary for the optimal management of outpatient URIs.

The study was performed during the winter\u2013spring season only; however, we believe that it was important to evaluate the clinical specificity of the assay during this season when the prevalence of circulating respiratory viral pathogens is high and nonspecific detection might be potentially increased. Only the BBL\u2122 CultureSwab\u2122 was used in this study, and since then, the use of nasal flocked swabs to improve the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses has been demonstrated, and combining nasal and throat swabs may not be required (Abu-Diab, et al., 2008). Despite several available multiplex assays, routine use in the clinical setting, particularly ambulatory clinics, is still limited by cost, the need to batch tests which prolongs the turnaround time, and accessibility. Lastly, although not a direct finding of the study, an important disadvantage of this \u201copen system\u201d assay that was noted in the laboratory is a higher risk for cross-sample contamination compared with closed real-time PCR systems.",
