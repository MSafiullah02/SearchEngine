            "text": "The vast majority of epidemic models described so far are compartmental, meaning that individuals are classified and grouped depending on their health status (Anderson and May, 1991, Bailey, 1975, Kermack and McKendrick, 1927). A famous example in ecology is the model of fox rabies in Europe (Anderson and May, 1979). This class of models presents the advantage of manipulating proportions of a same population and not having to deal with individualities. This line of reasoning has proven to be very efficient, especially from a mathematical and computational point of view, as models taking account of individual heterogeneities pose tractability problems for large populations and can be hard to analyze. Nevertheless, an insidious corollary of the compartmental approach has been the assumption that the population under consideration is well-mixed. Even if this sounds reasonable to describe small local populations, the broadening of this property to the metapopulation scale seems hazardous. In populations of wild animals as well as in human societies, individuals are generally grouped in high-density sites (i.e. cities, farms, and forest patches) separated spatially by large zones from which they are absent or present in negligible density only. Between these sites, elements of the landscape strongly affect the intensity at which individuals from different sites can interact (Real and Biek, 2007). The number of contacts each individual has is usually considerably smaller than the metapopulation size (Keeling and Eames, 2005). Therefore, the idea of a metapopulation-wide random-mixing of individuals does not seem to stand. While the variations of compartmental models have been overly studied (Hethcote, 1995), little attention has been paid to the correctness of the postulates on which this class of models relies.",

Our solution relies on an approach offering great flexibility to model complex multiscale systems by uniting System Dynamics (SD) (Ford, 1999, Forrester, 1971) and Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) (Grimm and Railsback, 2005). The philosophy and framework supporting this technique is referred to as System Dynamics\u2013Individual-Based (SD\u2013IB) hybrid modeling (Vincenot et al., 2011) and represents a novel modeling paradigm unused so far in ecology to our knowledge. Compartmental models are probably the most efficient way to simulate the dynamics of an epidemic as long as the well-mixed assumption is met (Fig. 2, top). System Dynamics is a very advantageous technique to build such models, because it is based on an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver and features stock-and-flow display, which is capable of great analytical power through its related tools (e.g. causal loop diagrams). Furthermore, it makes the model's structure easier and more straightforward to understand than raw differential equations. On the other hand, Individual-Based Modeling (IBM), technically originating from Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), is inherently capable of representing network structures in a spatially-explicit way making it possible to take into account distances between sites. In addition, it can handle large numbers of sites in a more efficient way than SD (Fig. 2, bottom). Thus, it is a perfect candidate to simulate the global spread of a disease in a network-like structure. These considerations motivated the use of an SD\u2013IB hybrid model to reproduce the contagion mechanisms in an accurate, understandable, and tractable manner.",

On top of these, two more state variables keep track of ongoing emigration and immigration of infectious individuals. Each site is also characterized by its unique two-dimensional spatial coordinates set at initialization time and invariant thereafter. Fundamentally, the model integrates disease dynamics at two spatial scales, namely inside of sites (local outbreaks) and between sites (global epidemics). For this purpose, connections between neighboring sites are also taken into account. A neighboring site is defined as any site closer than a threshold distance given by the neighborhood range parameter. The simulations, running in steps of one week, are meant to reproduce disease propagation inside of a 500 \u00d7 500 km study area in a time frame of several months to years after its introduction.",

Hence, a classic SIRS epidemic model with delayed recovery is used to model the dynamics of outbreaks inside of sites. The content of this type of compartmental model has been described extensively in the literature (Anderson and May, 1979, Hethcote et al., 1981) and has been used to study diseases involving potential recovery which confers temporary immunity (e.g. Orthomyxoviridae causing the seasonal flu). It features three compartments representing generic infection stages of individuals in a population: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). The epidemic's dynamics is then described as processes moving numbers of individuals between these compartments. Several rates dictate the transfer from one class to another, like the effective contact rate \u03b2 from S to I, the recovery rate \u03c5 from I to R, and the immunity loss rate d\nr\n\u2212 1 from R to S. Following the results of de Jong et al. (1995), we prefer basing the infection process on the true mass-action assumption, with a transmission term dependent on the size of the population. We keep the model as simple as possible by considering a constant population size. This way, the effects of disease dynamics are well-known in advance and their role in results obtained during later runs of the hybrid model at the metapopulation scale can be isolated from concurrent exogenous phenomena. Finally, the non-linear system can be expressed as a set of differential equations.(1)dSdt=dr\u22121R(t)\u2212\u03b2ItSt+It+RtS(t)dIdt=\u03b2ItSt+It+RtS(t)\u2212I(t\u2212\u03c5)dRdt=It\u2212\u03c5\u2212dr\u22121Rt\n",

To verify the previous equations and reconstruct an SIRS model similar to what was already studied in the literature (Hethcote et al., 1981), the \u201crecovery\u201d flow is set to delay its inflow by a given time period (i.e. the duration of infectiousness) to form what is often referred to as \u201cconveyor\u201d in the SD literature. It should be noted that we deliberately do not consider infinitesimal numbers of remaining individual in the infected compartment (I). A minimum value (floor) under which the number of infected individuals is considered as zero is fixed. The reason for this is clarified in Section 4.1.1.",

As a consequence, interactions between SD components and IB agents could be translated as algorithms performing data exchanges between objects. This offered an opportunity to bridge the SD model with IBM agents in a simple yet flexible manner, and this inside of a single program. Conceptually, the SD model was virtually embedded inside of the class of agents representing sites. Technically, this meant that for each instance of the \u201csite\u201d class, an internal reference to a new instance of our SD model was created. Moreover, to facilitate the interaction between each agent and its assigned SD model instance, we included in the structure of the template SD model two stocks \u2013 an immigration stock and an emigration stock \u2013 with which the agent's algorithmic rules could programmatically interact to perform the migration of infected individuals between sites. In short, a dedicated rule was written in the site agent class to retrieve the information of the emigration stock of the current site agent and, following the weighted distribution function (Eq.

High migration rates (superior to 0.25) lead to a dampening of the periodic oscillations generated by the epidemic episodes. In such cases, ultimately, we observed a convergence to a stable equilibrium. Another experiment involved simulating the effect of \u201ccutting off\u201d migrations inside of the metapopulation once a resurgent epidemic is installed. This resulted in a strong decrease of the global prevalence over the following months, with lower peaks than before, and an apparent eradication of the disease generally after less than 3 years. However, at this point, although only a negligible fraction of infected individuals were left (< 0.005% of the total population), allowing migrations again in the following months was enough to generate a violent epidemic resilience. Further results arose from studying the effect of dynamically modifying the contact rate of the disease. First, we could notice that an epidemic requires a lower contact rate to survive than to initially spread. For example, launching a successful epidemic required a contact rate of 1.335 while a minimum of 1.207 was enough to maintain it (given that the decrease didn't take place abruptly but progressively). In another experiment, we compared the decrease in transmissibility (i.e. contact rate) needed to break a stable epidemic with different migration rates. We observed that the higher the migration rate was, the more the epidemic was resistant to lower disease transmissibility. For instance, always on the same map, with a migration rate of 0.14, the epidemic could survive to a contact rate of 1.10, whereas with a migration rate of 0.01 the epidemic died off if the transmissibility dropped under 1.207. This apparent interference between demographic movements and epidemiological processes suggests the higher efficacy of synergistic containment initiatives. Finally, we also monitored a peculiar and counterintuitive behavior when the critical contact rate at which the epidemic is not viable anymore was reached. Before the abrupt disappearance of the epidemic, the peaks started growing more and more in amplitude while their frequency decreased.",

For instance, the hybrid model predicted that an epidemic episode could die-off if occurring in a network featuring a site carrying a smaller population entrapped in a bottleneck (Fig. 8, bottom). Moreover, as exposed in Section 3.2, spatial parameters could interact with epidemiological parameters in a synergistic or destructive way, with metapopulation-scale properties either exacerbating or balancing the contagion mechanism. This variability of epidemics depending on network topology has been constantly exhibited by our model, and proves that metapopulation structure is a factor of control important to integrate in the prophylaxis of transmissible diseases. On this aspect, the experiment simulating a suppression of migrations (Section 3.2) particularly underlined the usefulness of being able to restrain spatial processes and parameters but also the risk of relaxing policies before the total control of the epidemic. Besides, the results presented in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, and Section 3.2 also imply that all sites are not equal in importance, and as a consequence targeted policies on selected sites can have a far greater effect than metapopulation-wide measures. This is in accordance with conclusions from previous individual-based stochastic simulations of the worldwide spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Hufnagel et al., 2004) and of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) at a regional scale (Keeling et al., 2003).",

The correctness of this calculation is doubtful and can be risky (Bartlett, 1957). On the contrary, here, thanks to the mechanism revealed previously (Fig. 6), the hybrid model could produce such oscillatory behavior without considering fractions of remaining individuals for the number of infected and the number of migrating individuals. Accordingly, we can say that the network topology itself possesses the intrinsic capacity to make epidemics resurgent and can explain alone such phenomenon.",

Compartmental models generally use the basic reproduction number R\n0 as metric for this purpose. As expected, this was still verified on the local scale in the hybrid model; if R\n0\n > 1 was true for a given site, the disease could break out inside of this population. Nonetheless, as opposed to what models based on the well-mixed assumption would predict, this did not assure that the disease would spread successfully throughout the metapopulation. A second threshold appeared at the metapopulation scale. At this level, the spread of the disease was also conditioned by the migrations of individuals between sites. The combination of population size and connectivity of each site determined the number of infected individuals it would distribute to its neighbors. As a consequence, it was possible for a site not to get enough migrants to ignite a local outbreak, owing to the limited size or particular connectivity of his neighbors or both. Logically, except the starting point, any site for which \u2204t\u2211Sn\u2208neighbors(Scurrent)TSn,Scurrent,t\u22651 would surely not act as a relay for the outbreak. This could impact the spread of the disease, and, depending on the position of the site in the network topology, even bring an end to the epidemic (Fig. 8). It is safe to assume that this phenomenon would be amplified in more realistic models including stochastic mortality during migrations, an explicit lag proportional to travel duration, or migration strengths depending on the actual connectivity between sites. This limited capacity of R\n0 to judge from the chance of an outbreak to turn into an epidemic in this hybrid model supports the results obtained by Watts et al. (2005) with a stochastic individual-centered model, and fuels the surfacing debate on the disputable value of this metric to predict the outcome of large-scale epidemics (Larson, 2007).",

To render this multiscale nature of epidemics, our solution had a simple structure composed of two interacting layers (network of IBM agents, and at lower level, SD models). Its design was quick and straightforward considering the respective capabilities of the SD and IBM paradigms. Moreover, the sole creation of templates of an IBM agent class (for sites) and an SD submodel (for local outbreak dynamics) was needed, leaving all the instantiation, inter-agent linkage and distance calculation work to the framework. Consequently, further modifications, even dealing with local heterogeneities, were easy to perform thanks to the good structuring made possible by this hybrid system. At runtime, owing to the complete fusion of the IBM and SD models inside of the JVM, full feedback became available from both approaches. As a consequence, all the processes taking part in the epidemic's dynamics could be exposed in real-time for analysis (as visible in Fig. 3). The spread in the metapopulation was visible at the IBM level through a gradient change of color of the clouds representing sites depending on their epidemic stage as well as the display of the disease prevalence on each of them, while the real-time dynamics of the local outbreaks could be queried and displayed in SD form for any site selected. On top of this, stock-and-flow display was a convenient and accessible way to describe and show in real-time the local epidemic processes. It proved to be much easier and quicker to handle than differential equations or algorithmic rules. In this aspect, it enhanced considerably the understandability and communicability of the model, while making it easier to analyze.",

The larger the metapopulation to render, the longer the simulation takes to compute (Fig. 2, top). This problem does not occur with the hybrid model because the population dynamics is expressed as numbers, relaxing the need to consider each individual explicitly. Also, ABM expresses the behavior of individuals in the form of algorithms. This makes it more difficult to track the epidemic's dynamics than with the stock-and-flow display available in the hybrid model. Indeed, ABM makes it easy to visualize the behavior of individuals, but, unlike System Dynamics, it does not offer a way to explain the causes of the system's behavior.",

The most important factor of problems is the difficulty to create a robust mental model of how an algorithm works (Pennington, 1987, Vessey, 1989). Notwithstanding the promising standardization of a model description protocol for agent-based models (Grimm et al., 2006, Grimm et al., 2010) and the increasing use of flowcharts to explain algorithms, this remains a delicate issue (see, for example, Pitt et al., 2003). In the hybrid model, this obstacle is alleviated by the use of System Dynamics and more precisely stock-and-flow representation, which eases the understanding of the functioning of the local epidemiological processes by presenting both the causal relations between the different state variables and parameters (which can be transcribed on paper) and the dynamic variations of the value of each variable at runtime.",

The simplicity of the concept of CA also results in simulations with short execution times (Emrich et al., 2008). Nevertheless, fundamentally, CA is no more suitable than ABM to model network epidemics in a deterministic manner. It has the same downsides as the second variant of ABM models described above for the same reasons. What is more, it presents a further conceptual flaw: modeling a network by a grid is unnatural. In grids, every cell has the same number of other cells to which it is connected.

Our metapopulation model offers a tractable deterministic alternative to Watts et al.'s (2005) stochastic formalization of Bailey's (1975) view. An advantage of the present model resides in its capability to serve as platform to free existing compartmental epidemic models from the homogeneous mixing assumption at the metapopulation scale. Traditional compartmental models are generally expressed as ordinary differential equations. System Dynamics, which is used in our hybrid model to render local outbreaks, is based on an ordinary differential equation solver. Therefore, any compartmental model can be very easily imported in the hybrid framework and run in a distributed metapopulation. Moreover, once integrated, its structure is visualized through stock-and-flow representation, thereby making it more intelligible. The switch to System Dynamics also comes along with many precious tools to analyze the model's internal dynamics. In this manner, existing compartmental models can be reused and augmented inside of the hybrid model presented here.",

Individual-based models have been used to tackle such situations, but they pose some serious tractability issues (cf. Section 4.2.2). A possible evolution of the current model could offer a way to solve this dilemma. SD\u2013IB hybrid modeling makes it possible to model a component (here, the outbreak dynamics in a local population) in both SD and IBM, but have it simulated in only one of them at a time, with an event triggering the change of paradigm (Vincenot et al., 2011). Epidemics are more sensitive to individual behaviors in their early stages. Afterwards, their evolution can be rendered with a reasonable approximation with aggregated models relying on the law of large numbers, which have the advantage of being lighter to compute. Therefore, it would be possible to render individual-scale mechanisms at the early stage by having each site also contain an IB model of local outbreak dynamics. As soon as the second phase of the epidemic is reached, the IB model could be replaced dynamically by the SD model to switch back to the previously described solution. In this manner, in case of individuality being a necessary aspect to integrate in the model, this technique would make it possible to opt for an advantageous tradeoff between precision and tractability.",

If this choice was adapted for the present study, it induces some shortcomings. The most obvious one is that a parametrization that engenders no global epidemic with our model could very well yield different outcomes when run with a model not based on the previous design choice. Moreover, we can safely assert that our model is not able to cover all the space of possible epidemic scenarios due to this. Therefore, in other works, it could probably be beneficial to wave this limitation. To this end, simply introducing stochasticity represents one obvious solution. When encountering a fraction, the model could simply use it as a probability of the existence of an individual in the compartment considered. Another option lies in the dynamic transition between IBM and SD for the rendering of local outbreaks as described in the previous paragraph, because individuals would be rendered explicitly when present in low numbers. The stochastic interactions of individuals would then translate more accurately what fractions may represent in the aggregated SD model.",

As already recommended by Hethcote (1995) in his review of \u201cA thousand and one epidemic models\u201d, we advocate that less time should be spent studying endless parameter variations in compartmental models. Instead, we suggest a reorientation of research efforts towards a deepening of our understanding of the role of metapopulation spatial structure and heterogeneities between populations on the outcome of epidemics. The present study was not aiming at doing an in-depth analysis of network epidemic models, but it pointed out several critical factors that strongly impact them and that cannot be taken into account by traditional compartmental models. Moreover, the divergence between what was displayed by our hybrid model and the results output by a classic compartmental model confirmed that the latter carries several critical limitations, all originating from the premise that the metapopulation is well-mixed. This leads us to stress the importance of lifting this assumption, and more generally to study the effects of spatial disaggregation on compartmental models. To these ends, the original hybrid technique that we have presented here seems like a fitting alternative as regards simplicity, intuitiveness, and analytical power.",
