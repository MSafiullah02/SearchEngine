When considering the current state of graduate medical education, it comes as no surprise that the status quo is dominated by traditional didactic learning.

Microsoft Teams, in particular, was utilized due to its easy interface, accessible outlets, collaborative platform, and its integrated, secure cloud systems used by our healthcare system.

We piloted the platform with the Program Director, chief fellows, and fellowship administrators. This was followed by an orientation for fellows via a virtual meeting on this platform. The orientation was easily coordinated by sending fellows an email link. Once they joined the meeting, we were able to share our screen and walk them through various features of the application.

We then had our first virtual fellow conference that was organized with our existing Friday morning conference structure. In this session, 20 fellows attended with a guest faculty member and the Program Director. The session was even more engaging than our usual session.

First, ensure all potential users are oriented to the application. Second, ask the audience to place their microphones on mute unless they wish to speak to minimize unintended interruptions. Importantly, we do not suggest this for small virtual meetings as it stagnates collaboration. Third, encourage participants to use video highlighting the speaker to allow for a more dynamic, engaging experience. Of note, this increased engagement with video can be coupled with the ability to blur the user's background to maintain privacy. Fourth, assign a moderator who can ask people for their opinions and also give people who have not had an opportunity to speak, a chance to do so.
