CEPI is faced with complex decisions that involve confronting trade-offs between multiple objectives, diverse stakeholder perspectives, and uncertainty in vaccine performance. Objective: This study reports on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and its testing on CEPI decisions. Methods: Consultations with CEPI's Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) and document reviews helped identify and structure the criteria against which to evaluate proposals. Forty four subject-matter experts assessed performance of 18 proposals on multiple criteria. SAC preferences were elicited via a survey employing an adapted swing-weighting technique and were incorporated into measures of value and costto-value. A Monte Carlo simulation estimated overall value and ranking probabilities by value and by cost-to-value for each proposal. Results: Reviewer assessments and SAC preferences varied significantly. Despite this uncertainty, 14 preferred proposals emerged from the analysis and SAC recommendations on the basis of value and cost-to-value. In some cases, SAC recommendations deviated from the analysis because of: less emphasis on cost-to-value if budgets seemed underestimated by applicants, more emphasis on the likelihood of generating vaccines for target pathogens versus platform potential against unknown pathogens, and emphasis on funding a diversity of platforms per pathogen. Conclusions: Despite vaccine performance uncertainty and stakeholder preference heterogeneity, MCDA distinguished between options in a way that broadly corresponded to decisions. Divergence between the MCDA and the SAC point to potential updates needed to the model such as platform diversity trade-offs.

Evidence suggests that the average probability of successfully advancing a vaccine candidate from preclinical through to end of Phase II is less than 10% (Pronker, Weenen, Commandeur, Claassen, & Osterhaus, 2013) . In addition, the large costs (DiMasi, Grabowski, & Hansen, 2016; and long timelines (Russell & Gronwall, 2012) involved in developing vaccines make investment decisions in this space tremendously complex. This complexity is compounded by the fact that where commercial objectives are lacking, such as in the field of EID vaccines, commercial value alone is an insufficient criterion to making pharmaceutical R&D investment decisions (Antonijevic, 2015; Cioffe, 2011; Perez-Escobedo, Azzaro-Pantel, & Pibouleau, 2012; Phillips & Bana e Costa, 2007) .",

Seventeen proposals were at the preclinical development phase and one proposal was at clinical phase 1, with the aim that CEPI funding would advance them to the end of clinical phase 2. Proposals covered three different types of diseases: Lassa, MERS, and Nipah. Proposal budgets ranged from US$22 million to US$68 million, with a median cost of US$35 million. Proposal timeframes through to end of clinical phase 2 ranged from 4 to 6 years, with a median timeframe of 5 years. Due to confidentiality restrictions, individual proposal budgets and timeframes are not reported here; however, it is these budgets and timeframes that have been used to generate values in the framework presented below.

The uncertainty in performance means that there is substantial overlap in the confidence intervals around most proposals' performance on: the likelihood of generating a suitable vaccine for one of the CfP target pathogens (O1) and on the likelihood that the platform technology will be suitable for vaccine development against new pathogens (O2). Assuming that not more than 14 projects can be selected, Figure 3 plots the likelihoods of proposals ranking in the top 1-14, on the basis of discounted value versus cost-to-value. The consideration of budgets did not affect most of these ranking outputs in the analysis, for funding (proposals 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, and 18 Second, the SAC placed less emphasis on cost-to-value, as in some cases proposed budgets were considered unrealistic. One implication of this was that some proposals that had small budgets but whose overall value was otherwise low were not prioritized. Third, the SAC's deliberation pointed towards structural implications for the MCDA. A novel combined multiplicative-additive model structure was adopted. Few MCDA applications in healthcare have multiplicative components despite concerns that health technology assessment does not meet the analytical requirements of additive models (Marsh, Sculpher, Caro, & Tervonen, 2018) .",

These are ranked in two different ways, by: (a) costto-mean value and (b) proposals recommended for funding by the SAC by cost-to-mean value. 4 | DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This paper involved a number of innovations in the evaluation of early stage vaccine R&D candidates for EIDs, addressing gaps identified in previous literature. These included the explicit consideration of technical and operational feasibility of proposals using expert reviewer assessments of vaccine performance, in the absence of historical PoS data for these proposals; the multiplicative and additive combination of performance against a comprehensive list of criteria into an assessment of overall value of proposals, compliant with the theoretical properties required of a set of criteria in MCDA (Marsh et al., 2016) and applied as these properties have emerged in this particular decision context (Zeleny, 2011); the use of an adaptive swing weighting technique to elicit and incorporate stakeholder preferences into an assessment of overall value of proposals; and the use of Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainty in performance estimates and stakeholder preferences in proposal rankings. CEPI's investment in EID vaccine R&D faced significant uncertainty in both the potential performance of proposed vaccine candidates-which were all in preclinical or early clinical phases of development-and stakeholder objectives. This is evident in both the MCDA model inputs and outputs, with substantial overlap in the confidence intervals on the overall value of proposals. Nevertheless, the use of a Monte Carlo Simulation reflected this uncertainty in rank probabilities that distinguished proposals, and that were broadly consistent with the SAC's recommendations. During the SAC decision meeting in August 2017, MCDA findings informed deliberations on individual proposal performances and comparisons between proposals across diseases and platform technologies. The SAC's recommendations did not, however, correspond entirely with the MCDA. It was never the intention of the MCDA to remove the deliberative component of the decision-making process. However, the divergence in SAC recommendations and model outputs point to some lessons from the research and was also a way to validate the practical usefulness of the model. First, the SAC's deliberation pointed to criteria that could have been added to the MCDA, such as distributional considerationsspreading investment across proposals that employ different platforms. The implication of this was the selection of proposals that had modest value in terms of their combined performance across criteria C1-C5 but which added desired platform diversity into CEPI's investment portfolio.",

Specifically, criterion C4 relates to the anticipated clinical and operational benefits of the vaccine candidate in response to an outbreak of the targeted disease, if the candidate vaccine was to be successfully developed through to end of clinical phase 2. Criterion C5 relates to the anticipated potential of the technology platform used to develop the candidate vaccine to support the development of other candidate vaccines against newly or unexpectedly emerging pathogen outbreaks, regardless of whether the development of the vaccine candidate against the currently targeted pathogen was successful or not.Assuming a technology platform is successfully developed, the value of its potential to be used to develop a vaccine against a targeted pathogen (C4) is not dependent on its potential to be used to develop a vaccine against an unknown pathogen (C5) and vice versa-they are additively valuable. However, for either of these potentials to be realized, the platform needs to be successfully developed, which is reflected in criteria C1-C3. Moreover, there is no value in a platform being technically feasible (C2), if the vaccine developer does not have the competency to develop it (C1), vaccines cannot be manufactured to scale on this platform (C3) or the platform",
