            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a globally distributed avian disease that represents one of the most persistent sanitary problems in the commercial poultry industry. The etiologic agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae family.1,2 The disease is characterized by respiratory-specific symptoms including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales and nasal discharge.3 Chicks of all ages are susceptible to infection and the virus replicates in many tissues including the trachea, lung, spleen, kidney and ovaries. It is recognized that IBV isolates differ in virulence and tissue tropism.4 Most IBV strains are respiratory, inducing histological lesions in the trachea.5 However, Winterfield and Albassam noted that various passage levels of an IB vaccine virus, the Holland strain, were capable of causing microscopic lesions of interstitial nephritis.6 In addition, nephropathogenic strains cause histological lesions in trachea and kidneys.7-9 The first isolation of IBV from Iranian chick flocks was reported in 1994. Later, several Iranian researchers identified the 793/B serotype. This serotype turned out to be one of the predominant types of IBV in Iran.10 Different vaccines (Mass and 793/B vaccines) are now widely used in Iranian poultry farms, but IB outbreaks are still occurring. Recently, one of IBV variants named as IR-1, which was characterized based on partial S1 gene sequencing, has been isolated from Iranian broiler farms. Hashemzadeh et al. investigated the phylogenetic relation-ship of Iranian IBV isolates during 2010 to 2011. Moreover, they identified a new IBV variant, which was not related to any identified genotypes of IBV.11 This new IBV was again detected in a molecular surveillance performed during 2010 to 2014 and designated IR-1.12 Thereafter, IR-1 was isolated from the tissue samples collected from Iranian broiler farms during 2014 to 2015.13 The IR-1 which has been detected in 2010, is only circulated in Iranian poultry farms. In addition, there is no information about IR-1 pathogenic aspects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate IR-1 pathogenicity and tissue tropism in experimentally infected specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks. ",

Up to 28 days post infection (DPI) chicks were observed and clinical signs and mortality were recorded. Clinical signs were scored as follow: 0 = no abnormal breathing; 1 = slight or rare tracheal rales can be heard after provoking the chick by moving; 2 = moderate or frequent tracheal rales can be heard without moving the chick but not continuously and 3 = marked, continuous tracheal rales can be heard.

This was the first pathogenicity study of IR-1, which provided new insights on IBV pathogenesis. Middle East countries and Iran have intense trading and uncontrolled movement of inhabitants and animals across borders, which can facilitate the spread of the IR-1 to neighboring countries such as Turkey and Iraq. It is possible that this isolate exists in the neighboring countries, however, to date, it has not been identified.
