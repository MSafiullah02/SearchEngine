            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a contagious enteric virus with high genetic variability. PEDV infects pigs of all ages, especially the newborn piglets, causing severe acute watery diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration with the morbidity of up to 100% (Coussement et al., 1982; Shibata et al., 2000; Wood, 1977). The highly contagious enteric disease of swine associated with PEDV was first reported in England in 1971 and then it spread to another 13 countries of Europe and Asia (Ben Salem et al., 2010; Horvath and Mocsari, 1981; Kusanagi et al., 1992; Martelli et al., 2008; Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Pijpers et al., 1993; Pospischil et al., 1981; Smid et al., 1993; Takahashi et al., 1983). Later, with the advent of prototype CV777-derived vaccine, PED outbreaks in Asia countries became endemic. From 2007 to 2010, however, PED re-emerged in Thailand, Vietnam and especially China, caused by new variants of PEDV that have been emerged repeatedly since the October 2010, for which neither CV777 inactivated vaccine nor attenuated live vaccine could provide effective protection (Puranaveja et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012). Later, a similar variant PEDV was reported for the first time in April 2013 in the United States, which quickly spread to 36 states across the United States and its neighboring countries such as Canada and Mexico (Lee and Lee, 2014; Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014). Subsequently, the outbreak of PED occurred in Okinawa, Japan in October 2013, followed by Korea and Taiwan province of China\uff0cresulting in huge economic losses to the pig industry of the world (Park et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2016). In 2014, a newly variant PEDV strain (described as \u201cS-INDEL\u201d) with insertions and deletions in the spike gene was reported in the US, which was different from the original highly virulent PEDV strains (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Soon afterwards, S-INDEL was also reported in Germany and Portugal (Stadler et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). It has been proved that the major difference between the original variant strain and the newly emerging S-INDEL strain locates in the S protein, which might influence the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the two types of strains (Mesquita et al., 2015). Also, studies have indicated that PEDV strains are undergoing continuous evolution to adapt to the host environment.",

            "text": "PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, which was thought to mutate easily under the environmental selective pressure. It is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which also includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63)(Brian and Baric, 2005). PEDV consists of about 28 Kb PEDV genome including 7 open reading frames (ORF), coding polyprotein 1a and 1b, spike protein (S), accessary protein 3 (ORF3), envelop protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). S protein contains two functional subunits: S1, responsible for the cellular receptor binding, and S2, responsible for the membrane fusion (Liu et al., 2015). Though the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) on S1 remains controversial, N-terminal of S1 subunit (S1-NTD) has been demonstrated to be able to recognize the cellular carbohydrate N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), while the C-terminal of S1 subunit (S1-CTD) - binds to the amino peptidase N (APN)(Deng et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015). Studies have shown that, compared with the genome of prototype CV777, the mutations in the emerging PEDV variants are mainly concentrated in S1-NTD, reflecting the genetic correlation between different PEDV strains (Lin et al., 2017). Therefore, the analysis of S1-NTD is of vital importance in tracking the origin of the variant PEDV strains. Since 2010, the highly virulent PEDV variants have emerged in different parts of the world, resulting in significantly economic losses to the pork producers (Chen et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012b). Thus far, the classical CV777-derived vaccine has been widely used in the clinical practice in many Asian countries, which could not induce adequate protection against the disease induced by the emerged PEDV variants. Meanwhile, the application of vaccines in pigs may lead to continuous variation for PEDV to escape immune pressures. This study will provide more insights for predicting the prevalence as well as preventing the outbreaks of PED in the future by analyzing the genetic variation characteristics and the pathogenicity of PEDV isolates.",

And according to our survey, except for several pig farms with no PEDV vaccination, most of the pig farms were immunized by commercial inactivated PEDV vaccines. The total RNA of each sample was extracted by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcribed into cDNA by Revert Aid First Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as described in the handbooks. Then the cDNA was used for PCR with specific primers designed based on the conserved regions of PEDV, TGEV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and Group A Rotavirus (RoV-A) as described previously(Wang et al., 2016). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels.",

Noticeably, 37 amino acid mutations were identified in the S1-NTD of all the 15 strains (Table 3\n). Among these mutations, 6 insertions (59QGVN62, 140N and 157H) and 2 deletions (163NI164) were found to be consistent with all the other variant strains except OH851.

The structures of these two proteins were all predicted as homotrimers with S1-NTDs exposed on the surface of the proteins. When aligned with the structure of S1-NTD of CV777, S1-NTD of FJzz1 appeared five major conformational changes on residues 55\u201364, 84\u201389, 113\u2013120, 130\u2013142 and 157\u2013165, which all resided on the surface of S1-NTD (Fig. 3A). Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites prediction of S glycoprotein showed there existed 21 potential N-linked glycosylation sites on the S glycoprotein of CV777 (13 sites on S1 region, and another 8 sites on S2 region), while 20\u201323 N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted on S glycoprotein of the 15 strains obtained in this study. Remarkably, these 15stains lose four N-linked glycosylation sites at N57 (NSSS), N116 (NTSA), N131 (NKTL) and N235 (NCSG) predicted on the S1-NTD of CV777, but gained three additional putative sites at N62 (NSTW), N118 (NATA) and N1263 (NRTG) on the corresponding regions (Fig. 3B). Besides, 10 of our strains (SDxy, ZJhz, SHtd3, ZJ3, JXsc3, BJ4, HBap7, JSqd3, ZJ9, SHpd8) gained N728 (NSTR) and N1189 (NHTA) two sites on S1 and S2 regions, respectively (Table S3 and S4). And SHtd3 gained another one site N1310 (NNTL) on S2 regions. We speculated that these changes in structure and N-linked glycosylation sites of S glycoprotein may influence the antigenicity of PEDV.",

When infected with our isolated strain FJzz1, Vero cells developed visible CPE which was characterized by multiple regional cell fusion and syncytium formation within 24 hpi (Fig. 4A). Then, viruses from F1, F5, F10 and F20 were tested by RT-PCR and all these samples were positive for PEDV but negative for TGEV and RoV-A (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, the cells inoculated with F1, F5, F10 or F20 viruses were fixed and tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). All these cells treated with MAb against PEDV S protein, MAb against Nucleocapsid (N) protein and pig PEDV antisera displayed bright fluorescence, while the cells emitted no fluorescence when treated with the pig antisera against TGEV as the primary antibody (Fig. 4C).

Previous studies demonstrated that S gene is prone to mutate, which could change the pathogenicity of the virus (Hou et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2012). In this study, a total of 528 diarrheic samples including feces, fecal swabs, and small intestine were collected from 43 pig farms of 10 provinces and cities during 2011\u20132017, and then detected by RT-PCR targeting N gene of PEDV. Results showed that 385 samples were detected as PEDV positive with a positive rate as high as 72.9%, whereas very few samples were diagnosed as TGEV, PDCoV or PRoV positive. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to investigate the genetic variation of PEDV strains with different time span. The results showed that all the 15 strains identified in this study were clustered into G2 genotype, the homology for nucleotide and amino acid sequence between all the 15 PEDV strains and the currently circulating variant isolates were 96.9\u201399.7% and 97.0\u201399.8% respectively, higher than that of 93.3\u201393.9% and 91.7\u201392.6% between the 15 PEDV strains and the G1 genotype strains represented by CV777. Interestingly, some typical mutations on the S protein of Chinese prevalent variant strains were also found on three South Korean PEDV strains (KNU-0802: GU180143, KNU-0902: GU180145 and CNU-091222-01: JN184634) that were circulating in 2008\u20132009 (Fig. 2B), which suggested that the early variant PEDV strains of China which emerged in the late 2010 associated with the circulating strains in South Korea.

Also the mutations, especially some deletions and insertions in the S protein may change the antigenicity, pathogenicity and neutralization properties(Park et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015), and S1-NTD (19-233aa) may be the potential region relevant to the virulence of PEDV (Hou et al., 2017; Su et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2016). In this study, 49\u201353 mutations were found in the S1-NTD of all the 15 strains including FJzz1, which might change the major conformations of S1-NTD. Up to now, at least four neutralizing epitopes of PEDV have been identified in the S glycoprotein, namely the COE (499\u2013638), SS2 (748\u2013755), SS6 (764\u2013771) and 2C10 (1368\u20131374) (Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008). Coincidentally, four amino acid substitutions including T554 \u2013 S, G599 \u2013 S, L769 - S and D771 - S were observed in these neutralizing epitopes. Whether these amino acid mutations will affect the neutralization activity of the above epitopes warrant further exploration. What's more, compared with CV777, the 15 stains showed four amino acid insertions (59QGVN62) and three amino acid substitutions (S118 \u2192 N118, 130DN131 \u2192 130SI131), lost three N-linked glycosylation sites at N57 (NSSS), N116 (NTSA), N131 (NKTL) predicted on the S1-NTD of CV777, but gained two additional putative sites at N62 (NSTW) and N118 (NATA) on the corresponding regions. Previously, researchers have demonstrated the N-linked glycosylation sites on the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) play a critical role in the viral entry (Han et al., 2007). Therefore, we speculate that these variations might result in more efficient recognition and stronger affinity with the specific cell receptor, sugar co-receptor or even other unknown co-receptors, thus better aiding the viral entry. This could be partially supported by the fact that the variant strain exhibited stronger sugar-binding activities than the prototype strain CV777 (Deng et al., 2016). Meanwhile, the changes of N-linked glycosylation sites may also have an influence on antigenicity of certain important epitopes, which may partly explain why CV777-derived vaccine provided poor protection against variant strains. This adaptive variation, however, may also be an evolutionary strategy for immune evasion of the variant PEDV strains, but further experiments such as reverse genetics are required to confirm all these assumptions(Beall et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018).",

            "text": "In order to investigate the pathogenicity of variant strains to piglets, fifteen unweaned neonates were infected with FJzz1. The results showed that the oral Group developed diarrhea clinical signs around 8 h earlier than that of the intramuscular Group, and the piglets in oral Group began to die around 40 h earlier than that of the intramuscular Group. Moreover, the morbidity of the oral Group reached 100% 24 h post infection. By contrast, all the piglets showed diarrheic disease within 48 h post infection in the intramuscular Group. Nevertheless, diarrhea clinical signs of the intramuscular Group last longer than that of the oral group with more severe degree of clinical signs including diarrhea and loss of weight. Previous studies reported that the intestinal proteases are critical for PEDV release rather and entry (Liu et al., 2016; Shirato et al., 2011). When infecting piglets by the oral route, the virus could target to intestine through the digestive tract directly, and the intestinal proteases might lead to the earlier appearance of clinical signs by better aiding the viral release (Wicht et al., 2014). It has been reported that PEDV could invade the blood stream, but it fails to replicate actively there, and the viraemia levels may not necessarily be connected to virulence or pathogenicity with mechanisms not fully understood (Chen et al., 2016). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that the PEDV particles could be recognized and presented by DCs of nasal epithelial cells and then delivered to CD3+ T cells of cervical lymph node, reaching the intestine through the blood and lymph circulation to infect the intestinal epithelial cells(Li et al., 2018). This report may support our study that intramuscular injection of PEDV could also cause the typical clinical signs to piglets, although the specific molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Therefore, when infecting piglets by the intramuscular injection, the virus could be delivered to the target site through the blood circulation system without intestinal proteases, resulting in later appearance of clinical signs. As is known to all, fecal-oral transmission is the main natural route of PEDV for infection, so it is much easier for the virus to simulate this progress by oral inoculation. However, compared with the intramuscular injection, the oral inoculation is supposed to be unstable and require stricter operation, because part of the virus would be lost during the infection due to the uncertain in vivo conditions of piglets. Therefore, intramuscular injection exhibited basically the same efficiency to cause obvious clinical signs, despite slight delay of clinical signs at the initial phase of infection. This finding supports the idea that intramuscular injection of live, attenuated PEDV may be an alternative vaccination route. In conclusion, we analyzed the genetic variation and pathogenicity of the emerging PEDV isolates of China, indicating that G2 variant PEDV strains as the main prevalent strains continue to mutate along with time. The variant strain FJzz1 with mutations in the S protein is highly pathogenic to the piglets, and the intramuscular injection may also be an alternative inoculation route. This study will provide a basis for understanding of the genetic variation and pathogenicity of PEDV.",
