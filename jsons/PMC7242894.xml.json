Sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of an antidiabetic drug. SGLT2 is expressed mainly in proximal convoluted tubular epithelial cells and reabsorbs of >90% of filtered glucose7. In the follow-on trials for evaluation of the cardiovascular safety, secondary effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce albuminuria and decline in GFR promoted further exploration into their potential usage in DKD8\u201310. SGLT2 inhibition lessens glucose-coupled sodium reabsorption, normalizes solute delivery to macula densa, restores tubuloglomerular feedback, reverses afferent arteriole vasodilation and therefore protects glomerular hemodynamics11,12. However, as the direct target, how the proximal tubular epithelial cell is altered by SGLT2 inhibitor and whether the alternation has therapeutic effects remain to be elucidated.",

            "text": "The highly metabolic kidney tubules equipped with plenty of mitochondria require large amounts of ATP for their normal task of reabsorption13,14. In the tubulointerstitial compartment under physiological conditions, ATP is mainly generated via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of fatty acid (FA) and ketone, and consumes a large amount of molecular oxygen13,15,16. However, in diabetic conditions, the altered delivery of metabolic substrates and oxygen to the kidney results in a shift to glucose oxidation17,18 and hypoxia19. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) plays a key role coordinating the adaptive metabolic reprogram from mitochondrial OXPHOS to glycolysis under pathological condition of decreased oxygen availability20,21. HIF-1\u03b1 is ubiquitously expressed and regulated by oxygen-dependent posttranslational hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing (PHD-containing) enzymes. HIF-1\u03b1 is stabilized as oxygen concentration declines and regulates expression of target genes, including glycolytic enzymes and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase (PDK)22. HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1)23 and acyl-CoA dehydrogenases24 and leads to reduced fatty acid oxidation (FAO). These observations support a central role for HIF in regulation of metabolism in the kidney tubule.",

Diabetes individuals were older, and had a significantly higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and urinary protein excretion level but lower diastolic blood pressure than non-diabetes control. We found markedly higher lipid accumulation (Fig. 1a, b) in tubulointerstitial space of diabetic individuals. A further interrogation indicated that the levels of transcriptional regulator PPAR\u03b1 and key enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1\u03b1 (CPT1\u03b1) related to FAO were markedly lower in diabetic individuals compared with samples obtained from people without diabetes (Fig. 1c, d). Levels of key regulator of glucose utilization hexokinase (HK2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were higher in diabetic samples compared with nondiabetic controls (Fig. 1e, f). Lactate level was quite low in urine of nondiabetic individuals. However, urinary excretion level of lactate was markedly increased in diabetic individuals and was associated with albuminuria (Fig. 1g), indicating that glucose is used mainly for anaerobic glycolysis. In this set of individual samples, we used supervised correlation to analyze lipid droplets and urinary lactate with respective urinary albumin level. We found area of lipid droplet to directly correlate with albumin excretion rate (AER) (Fig. 1h). Collectively, these results identify a metabolic signature in diabetic kidneys and reveal a significant correlation between the urinary albumin and a metabolic shift from FAO to glycolysis.",

Cells were cultured under 5.5 mmol/l (control) or 30 mmol/l (high glucose, HG) of D-glucose for 24 h. HG treatment was associated with more intracellular lipid-droplet accumulation (Fig. 3a, b). Consistently, HG treatment reduced Ppar\u03b1 mRNA (Fig. 3c) and protein (Fig. 3d) levels, as well as its downstream targets Cpt1\u03b1 and Acadl. The alteration of Ppar\u03b1 and its downstream target gene expression is probably the cause of the lower FAO and accumulation of lipid in PTCs. The glucose decline in medium of PTCs was markedly increased in the condition of high glucose content (Fig. 3e). Levels of glucose metabolism-related enzymes were higher in HG-treated PTCs (Fig. 3f, g). Lactate was higher after HG treatment, indicating that glucose is used mainly for anaerobic glycolysis (Fig. 3h). We found that treatment with HG was associated with metabolic switch, phenotypes similar to what we observed in human and animal diabetic kidneys. These results indicate the characteristics of the alteration of enzymes that regulate FAO and carbohydrate metabolism, accompanied by high intracellular lipid accumulation and lactate concentration in diabetic tubule.",

The transcriptional regulator HIF-1\u03b1, which was virtually absent in healthy kidneys, was upregulated in diseased renal tubules (Fig. 4a, b). PPAR\u03b1 and HK2 are well-described HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional targets, suggesting a central role for HIF-1\u03b1 in the metabolic gene reprogramming of renal tubule cells. The transcript of Hif-1\u03b1 was not changed in diabetic mice (Supplementary Fig. S1a), but the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 protein was higher accompanied by the lower expression of PHD2 in kidneys from mice with diabetes (Fig. 4c). The increased expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in renal tubule cells (Fig. 4d, e) preceded the change of morphology, potentially suggesting a causal role. In PTCs, similarly, expression but not transcript (Supplementary Fig. S1b) of HIF-1\u03b1 is increased while PHD2 is decreased soon after HG treatment (Fig. 4f), suggesting that HIF-1\u03b1 is not de novo synthesized. Immune staining shows the location of increased HIF-1\u03b1 in nuclei of PTCs, indicating the transcriptional activity of HIF-1\u03b1 in HG-treated PTCs (Fig. 4g).",

Food and water intake in diabetic group was approximately two- and threefold greater than that in the control group, respectively. Dapagliflozin treatment markedly reduced the food (Fig. 5a) and water intake (Fig. 5b) in diabetic group. The blood glucose levels in dapagliflozin groups were significantly lower than that in the vehicle group and losartan group, and comparable with that in the control group at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment (Fig. 5c). Diabetic mice excreted a significant amount of glucose in the urine, whereas control mice did not exhibit such glucosuria (Fig. 5d). By contrast, the urinary glucose levels in dapagliflozin groups were significantly higher than that in the control group, and comparable with that in the vehicle and losartan group at 12 weeks, perhaps reflecting that the effects of reduction in blood glucose levels were eliminated by the inhibition of glucose reabsorption in the dapagliflozin groups. The increase of kidney/body weight ratio in diabetic group was reduced by dapagliflozin treatment (Fig. 5e). Urinary excretion of albumin and NGAL level were remarkably increased in diabetic group, reflecting dysfunction of glomerular filtration barrier and tubular epithelial cells. Both dapagliflozin and losartan treatment significantly reduced the urinary albumin (Fig. 5f) and NGAL (Fig. 5g) levels at 12 weeks. Morphological analysis (Fig. 5h) revealed that glomerular tuft area (Fig. 5i), mesangial expansion, and mesangial matrix hyperplasia (fractional mesangial area, FMA) (Fig. 5j), which were increased in diabetic mice, were also equally improved by dapagliflozin and losartan treatment. However, increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Fig. 5k, l) and immune infiltration (Fig. 5m) in diabetic mice were only greatly reduced in dapagliflozin groups, but not in the losartan group. These findings suggest that both dapagliflozin and losartan treatment ameliorate diabetic kidney damage, with a greater tubular protective effect observed in the dapagliflozin group.",

Dapagliflozin prohibited glucose-induced HIF-1\u03b1 expression and the consequent metabolic shift. To test this hypothesis, we incubated PTCs with the HIF stabilizer molidustat, which was previously shown to inhibit PHD and thereby stabilize HIF-1\u03b1 in vivo and in vitro27,28. In PTCs, expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was rapidly increased after molidustat treatment (Fig. 8a). Molidustat also induces the nuclei location of increased HIF-1\u03b1 in PTCs (Fig. 8b). Molidustat treatment was associated with metabolic changes in PTCs as demonstrated by more intracellular lipid-droplet accumulation (Fig. 8c, d). The Ppar\u03b1 mRNA levels and those of its downstream targets Cpt1\u03b1 and Acadl were consistently reduced by molidustat (Fig. 8e). In contrast, levels of glucose metabolism-related enzymes were higher in molidustat-treated PTCs (Fig. 8f). Level of lactate, a direct measurement of glycolysis, was higher after molidustat treatment (Fig. 8g). These results collectively suggest that molidustat treatment may cause cell metabolic switch, a similar phenotype that is observed in HG-treated cells.",

Notably, this metabolic alteration in the diabetic kidney was ameliorated by SGLT2 inhibition, suggesting that reabsorption of excessive glucose may be the key for the metabolic switch from FAO to glycolysis in renal tubule cells under diabetic condition. Consistent with this, stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 in the tubule cells of diabetic kidneys was also nullified by SGLT2 inhibition. Reduced metabolic disorders in the tubule cells by SGLT2 inhibition was accompanied by the alleviation of hyperfiltration, mesangial expansion, albuminuria and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and immune infiltration. Although SGLT2 inhibition lowers blood glucose levels and may contribute to these preferable effects, the probability that SGLT2 inhibitor can directly protect the proximal tubule merits investigation.",

The remaining 10% of escaped glucose is subsequently reabsorbed by SGLT1 expressed in the straight descending proximal tubular epithelial cells29,30. Diabetes-induced changes in expression and transporters activity of SGLTs remain controversial; however, the principle role of SGLT2 in glucose reabsorption is well established30. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of dapagliflozin for SGLT2 is less than 1000th of that for SGLT1, so that the drug has high specificity for SGLT2 inhibition and does not interfere with intestinal glucose absorption31. The unexpected kidney protection effects of SGLT2 inhibitor was discovered in clinical trials for evaluation their cardiovascular safety9,32,33. The explanation of the kidney protective role of SGLT2 inhibition is normalizing glomerular hemodynamics and reversing afferent vasodilation by lowering sodium and chloride reabsorption in proximal tubule and consequently reactivates tubuloglomerular feedback by restoring solute delivery to the macula densa34. The hemodynamic effect is consistent with the reduction of albuminuria and risk for doubling of serum creatinine level. In addition to hemodynamic effects, previous studies have indicated that SGLT2 inhibition could decrease glucose uptake through proximal tubule, mitigate-related tubulointerstitial injury, and thereby protect diabetic kidney35,36. However, the tubular protective mechanism is not quite understood. In this study, in contrast to glomerular changes which were mitigated by dapagliflozin and losartan treatment, tubulointerstitial lesions, including fibrosis and macrophage infiltration, were reduced only by dapagliflozin, but not by losartan treatment. This suggested that besides hemodynamic effect, SGLT2 inhibition has additional therapeutic effects probably by normalizing metabolic shift to ameliorate tubular injury.",

            "text": "The kidneys have vast amount of mitochondria and consume second-highest level of molecular oxygen at rest13. Most of the oxygen is metabolized to produce ATP by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In the kidney tubulointerstitial compartment under healthy conditions, the majority of the ATP is generated via fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, the kidney produced ATP is mainly used for power tasks such as reabsorption of glucose, sodium, ions, and other metabolites from filtered urine37\u201339, which are primarily performed by proximal tubule. Other ATP-consuming processes, such as contraction of mesangial cells and podocytes and synthesis of hormone and protein, require substantially lower ATP than those of tubule cells. The synergistic loop between ATP production and utilization is balanced by oxygen, kidney blood flow, and metabolite reabsorption40,41. In diabetes, changes of sodium handling in the proximal tubule are major contributor to alteration in GFR42, indicating a tubulocentric view of DKD. This view is further supported by the premise that renal tubule injury is a vital determinant of the progression to ESRD6,43. Proximal tubule cells depend critically on FAO as their energy source, whereas depressed FAO is associated with higher lipid accumulation in tubule cells from kidneys of individuals and animals with diabetes. Excessive glucose overload in tubule cells causes defective FAO, which has a key role in tubular damage and kidney disease progression as previously reported44. Recent study using ob/ob diabetic mice reported that glucose exposure caused metabolic alteration, oxidative stress especially in glomeruli, which were reduced by SGLT2 inhibition. The amelioration of albuminuria, hyperfiltration, and mesangial expansion were also observed in our study; however, tubulointerstitial lesions, including macrophage infiltration, was not ameliorated by ipragliflozin treatment45. In their latest study, they mentioned that downregulation of fatty acid metabolism and upregulation glucose metabolism in diabetic renal proximal tubule by HIF-1\u03b1 stabilizer was protective. Moreover, they suggested that fatty acid metabolisms were upregulated in a very early stage of diabetes46. The discrepancy between these reports and our data may be explained by the different animal models and stages of diabetic kidney disease. Nevertheless, in our study, the increased LDH and lactate indicate that glucose is applied mainly for anaerobic glycolysis. The glucose overload-induced metabolic shift from FAO to glycolysis causes tubular dysfunction in diabetes, which makes tubulocentric actually metabolocentric view of DKD39.",

Sodium is reabsorbed along with the glucose in proximal tubule cells, which is also prohibited by SGLT2 inhibition, indicating that SGLT2 inhibition probably affects renal oxygen content. Studies suggested the increased oxygen consumption in diabetic kidney was associated with renal hypoxia17. Renal hypoxia is common in individuals with DKD51. Our results reveal that SGLT2 inhibition blocks the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1, which may explain its effects on amelioration of metabolic switch in animal DKD model. Luseoglifozin inhibits HIF-1\u03b1 and subsequent glycolytic genes expression in diabetic kidneys52, which is in accordance with the decreased glycolysis enzyme expression and increased lactate from diabetic individuals and animal in our study. However, it was reported that prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor protects against ischemia or obesity-induced kidney injury by modulation of metabolic disorders and inflammation53,54. Stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 induces transcriptional regulation of diverse series of genes contribute to various pathophysiologic changes, such as metabolic switch, extracellular matrix accumulation, apoptosis prevention, and capillaries protection21,55\u201357, which might lead to diverse effects beyond the scope of this study.",
