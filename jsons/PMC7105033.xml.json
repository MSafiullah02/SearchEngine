Acute bronchiolitis is characterized by tachypnea, wheezing, suprasternal or intercostal retraction, sometimes cyanosis or apnea, and even respiratory failure.1 As a virus-predominant disease, the most common acute bronchiolitis pathogen is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), causing more than 50% of cases. Other respiratory pathogens include the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus, and enterovirus.2\n",

Mlinaric-Galinovic et al.18 reported that RSV was responsible for 49% of 1,010 hospitalized Croatian infants with LRTI and younger than 6 months old over an 11-year period. In the study of Miron et al.2 in Israel, 490 previously healthy babies younger than 24 months hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis during 4 winter months were enrolled. RSV was identified in 76% of children. Midulla et al.19 found RSV in 41.2% of 182 Italian infants with acute bronchiolitis in three consecutive annual epidemic periods. In our study, RSV was the most frequently detected virus, presented in 41.7% of all patients. RSV in Taiwan circulates year-round and peaks mainly in spring and fall with annual variation.20 Thus, if we enrolled patients over 12 months the incidence of RSV may change.",

However, hMPV-positive patients accounted for up to 27.1% in our study, which may be related to N gene use with higher sensitivity in hMPV detection. Regarding the difference between RSV and hMPV, Chan et al. reported that RSV-infected children at a younger age lead to longer hospital stays and higher oxygen demand than hMPV did.23 On the other hand, Viazov reported that the clinical characters of RSV and hMPV bronchiolitis showed no significant difference, except the duration of symptoms was shorter in hMPV-infected patients.24 Mullins\u2019 data showed similar disease severity in RSV and hMPV-infected children.25 No significant difference was found in hospital stay or fever duration, severity score, white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, or complication rate in our study, similar to Carraciolo\u2019s report.26 However, RSV-positive patients showed a trend for longer duration of O2 demand (p = 0.053). The discrepancy among these studies may result from the great heterogenecity in studied populations (age group, diagnosis, and inpatient/outpatient). To differentiate these two viruses judging by clinical information is difficult. Therefore, further researches with large sample sizes and detailed subgroup analyses are necessary.",

In the Italian report, hBoV was isolated in 8.2% of patients, including 61.8% of coinfection with various viruses, which resulted in difficulties in defining the true causative virus.28 Dina et al.29 reported a 1.6% incidence of hBoV in hospitalized children in France, with coinfection presented in four of seven hBoV-positive children. The prevalence rate of hBoV in our study was 6.25%, and two of the three hBoV-positive patients had more than one pathogen identified (coinfected with RSV and hMPV, respectively).
