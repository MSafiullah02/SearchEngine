Uganda alone was unable to meet the demands of the tourism industry.",

This may minimize loss of natural habitat (35 km 2 of Parc National des Virunga was deforested in <2 years). It may also reduce poaching of gorillas (18 mountain gorillas were killed between 1995 and 1998), and transmission of human diseases to wildlife from improper disposal of human and medical waste (used syringes, human waste, and bloodstained materials were dumped within Parc National des Virunga). \"Ranger Based Monitoring,\" developed in 1996 as part of a rehabilitation program for Parc National des Virunga, employs field staff to collect basic information about gorillas, elephants, and humans in the park, thereby informing park management decisions. This simple and cost-effective program now serves as a strategic protected area management tool (Lanjouw, 2000; Gray and Kalpers, 2005) . It must be stressed that the success of this tool in the past has rested on the bravery of field staff, who risked and in some cases gave their lives to protect gorillas (e.g., at Karisoke). Lanjouw's (2000) examples of the strategies implemented by the International Gorilla Conservation Programme provide alternative scenarios that can be incorporated into an integrated crisis management plan for all gorilla tourism sites. Such an integrated crisis management plan should also incorporate contingency plans for excessively high or low visitor numbers in order to prevent overwhelming problems from developing. These might include access to a database for travel agents or tourists wanting to visit gorillas with updates on sites within a region that are best suited to cater for tourists at any given time.",

Local communities cannot afford to become dependent upon income generated by tourism alone. In the event of a crisis, the question arises, should funding also be made available to local communities involved in the tourism project? The establishment of trust funds (or other stable and sustainable sources of revenue) by international donors and conservation organizations may ensure that gorilla conservation does not rely solely on tourism funds or other \"alternative economic ventures\" (Blom, 2001b, p.41) . Ideally, all gorilla tourism sites should receive sufficient funding, irrespective of tourist numbers. A specific fund for the long-term care of gorillas habituated for tourism could provide money to care for gorillas during times when tourism is not possible. Reserve funds set up from tourist income could be used to support site(s) financially during times of tourist scarcity. U.K. tourists seem \"prepared to pay a premium of perhaps 5% for guarantees of responsible and sustainable travel\" (World Tourism Organization, 2001, p.10). Thus, responsible tourism might provide a potential source of funding for conservation, but conservation managers must determine how much money is needed to support each gorilla tourism site, and whether a 5% contribution by each tourist to a reserve fund is a realistic figure.",

Moyini and Uwimbabazi (2000) provide a detailed economic analysis of gorilla tourism in Uganda during the 1990s, in order to \"assess the economic value of the mountain gorilla as a tourism resource\" (p.13). More than 17,500 people (predominantly from outside Uganda) visited gorillas at Mgahinga and Bwindi between 1994 and 1999. The average expenditure per visitor was approximately US$768. Moyini and Uwimbabazi's (2000) estimates are based on full capacity utilization of the three habituated groups of gorillas. At full capacity (8,760 visitors per year-6,570 at Bwindi and 2,190 at Mgahinga), the annual benefit to the Uganda Wildlife Authority is US$2.1 million (gorilla permits and park fees), with benefits for local communities estimated at US$678,000 (20% of entrance fees plus direct tourist expenditures). Moyini and Uwimbabazi (2000) stress that the combination of an over-representation of lower income spectrum of tourists in their study sample, and the likelihood of tourists engaging in other tourism activities in Uganda, suggest that their estimates are rather conservative.",

Yet, the costs of the habituation process and infrastructure may be prohibitive, unless well funded by large international organizations over a prolonged period (Blom, 2001a (Blom, , 2001b . The time needed to habituate a gorilla group can vary between six months and 14 years (Goldsmith, 2005) . Blom (2001b) estimates that a two-year habituation period for one group of gorillas, based on the process used at Dzanga-Sangha (Central African Republic), would cost at least US$250,000. This figure excludes the budget for the health-monitoring program that should be conducted prior, during, and after habituation. Blom (2001b) points out that the potential revenues that gorilla tourism can generate for protected area management, as a self-financing strategy, in the central African region is limited at best. The mountain gorilla tourist sites have set a high standard of service to tourists, resulting in expectations of wellorganized tracking and good gorilla viewing. These sites have also generated large and well-publicized revenues during stable periods, which may set unrealistic financial expectations in other countries. Western lowland gorillas living in forests that are logged, and where they are hunted for bushmeat, may be difficult to habituate. Djoh and van der Wal (2001) emphasize that \"the gorillas have many bad memories of their encounters with men...If they have too many bad memories, it could very well be impossible to regain their trust\" (p.34). Western lowland gorillas may also live in closed and flat lowland forests with dense undergrowth, which makes tracking more difficult and risky, since trackers unexpectedly may stumble into gorillas (Djoh and van der Wal, 2001 ).",

These include Dzanga-Sangha in Central African Republic, Lop\u00e9 Wildlife Reserve in Gabon, Maya north saline (Odzala National Park), Lossi Gorilla Sanctuary (about 15 km from Odzala National Park) in Congo-Brazzaville, and Monte Alen National Park in Equatorial Guinea. Habituation trials have also taken place at Lomi\u00e9 (near Dja Wildlife Reserve) in Cameroon (Aveling, 1999; Blom, 2001a; Djoh and van der Wal, 2001) . These sites provide opportunities to observe gorillas in a variety of ways. At Maya north saline, gorillas and other large mammals (e.g., forest elephants, buffaloes, bongos, and sitatungas) feeding in forest clearings can be viewed from observation hides. At Lossi, tourists could once view gorillas feeding on fruit above them in the trees (prior to the gorillas' decimation by Ebola). Unlike mountain gorilla and eastern lowland gorilla tourism sites, not all western lowland gorilla tourism sites are located within traditional protected areas (e.g., national parks and reserves). The Lossi site still belongs to its traditional owners, the villagers of Lengui-Lengui, who developed gorilla tourism as part of a community conservation initiative (Aveling, 1999) . The Lomi\u00e9 site is located partly within a production forest, and partly within a forest requested as a community forest by the neighboring villages of Karagoua and Koungoulou (Djoh and van der Wal, 2001) .",

For almost a decade, Magdalena Bermejo and Germain Ilera have been there, studying and monitoring eight families of gorillas (139 individuals). Two of these groups, the first lowland gorillas to be habituated in central Africa, were habituated for tourism. At the end of 2002, Ebola virus was confirmed in four gorilla and two chimpanzee carcasses. Since then, all but a handful of gorillas have disappeared from the study area-victims of an Ebola epidemic (Aveling, 2003) . Ebola appears to pose an even greater threat to western lowland gorillas than the bushmeat trade. The combined impact of Ebola and hunting has resulted in an estimated 56% decline in the gorilla and chimpanzee population numbers in Gabon and Congo Republic, between 1983 (Walsh et al., 2003 .",

These potential threats fall into three main categories-the process of habituating gorillas for tourism, increased risk of disease transmission, and inappropriate tourist purchases. Before embarking on an analysis of potential threats of tourism, it should be noted that the high profile of \"Virunga\" mountain gorillas (which excludes \"Bwindi\") and protection afforded them by regular tracking and monitoring for tourism and research (260 of the total 359 + individuals) have resulted in an increase in mountain gorillas over the last three decades (annual growth rate of 1.0-1.3% per year) despite prolonged armed conflict in the area (Kalpers et al., 2003) . \"Many of the warring factions have actually shown commitment and invested resources to ensure that the gorillas were not harmed,\" as a direct result of recognition of these gorillas as an \"important resource (through tourism)\" (Kalpers et al., 2003, p.335 ). Nonetheless, not all mountain gorillas habituated for tourism and research have fared equally well. Whereas four of the gorilla groups in Rwanda increased in size by 76% over a decade (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) , seven habituated groups in DRC declined in size by almost 20% in four years Kalpers et al., 2003) .",

In the absence of wind, sneeze particles can travel 6 m (20 feet), influenza can be transmitted up to 20 m, and other airborne organisms may travel even further in favorable wind and ultraviolet light conditions (Homsy, 1999) . To protect primates from human diseases in zoos, Plexiglas structures are often built as a barrier. The only protection that is afforded to wild gorillas is the strict enforcement of an adequate minimum distance. Unfortunately, it is the one rule that the guides and park staff report that they have the most difficulty enforcing (Homsy, 1999) . Homsy (1999) points out that researchers have tended to focus on the risk of tourists passing on respiratory infections to gorillas (e.g., measles, tuberculosis, pneumonia, influenza, and respiratory syncitial virus). Disturbingly, measles microbes can travel great distances in the open (especially if it is windy), and polio microbes can survive in the soil for several months (Homsy, 1999) . There are, however, many other diseases that can be contracted by gorillas if they come in contact with human faeces or fomites (inanimate objects). Hepatitis A and B viruses, shigella, trichuris, herpes simplex, scabies, polio, and intestinal worms may pose an even greater threat to the ultimate survival of wild populations of gorillas (Homsy, 1999) . The habituation process may cause stress, which in turn may exacerbate diseases, such as scabies or sarcoptic mange (McNeilage, 1996; Woodford et al., 2002) .",

(2001) found that few were currently vaccinated against influenza (3%), mumps (21%), or measles (37%). Almost half were not vaccinated against tuberculosis, and about a third were not vaccinated against viral hepatitis A or polio. Symptoms of illness experienced during their visit to Africa included diarrhea (>50%), coughing (>10%), fever, vomiting, and general illness (all >5%). Disturbingly, five cases of herpesvirus, six of influenza, and one of chickenpox were considered infectious at the time of visit. With respect to tuberculosis, less than 50% of the tourists had ever been tested. Three people (10%) reported having had positive intradermal skin test results, indicating that they may have been infectious at the time of their visit. This study provides evidence that the potential exists for tourists to spread infection to more than one wild group of gorillas and/or chimpanzees. Wallis and Lee (1999) point out that researchers (and visitors) who work with laboratory apes in the United States undergo stringent testing procedures for tuberculosis (at least annually) and usually wear gloves and masks if they come in contact with the apes. Yet, ironically, these same people can visit gorillas in the wild, without having to take similar precautionary measures.",

Special ranger groups (local community members and park rangers) have been trained to patrol boundary areas, and use loud noises (e.g., bells or drums) to \"herd\" gorillas back into the national park (Lanjouw et al., 2001) . Despite such attempts to alleviate conflict between gorillas and farmers, gorillas may still be killed while crop raiding. Recently, a three-year old gorilla (Bahati) was killed in a corn field near the border of Parc National des Virunga in DRC, after stones and wood were hurled at his family who had consumed 235 corn stalks (Kiyengo and Binyeri, 2003) . If a site is to be developed for gorilla tourism, opportunities for creating buffer zones (e.g., nonpalatable crops), or physical barriers (Lanjouw et al., 2001) should be explored and implemented before the habituation process begins.",

Relatively long incubation periods and rapid travel between countries make the adoption of standardized guidelines and rules at all gorilla sites vital. How do researchers themselves fit into the current picture? Are they a special category of tourist? Unlike tourists who are restricted to a one-hour visit with gorillas, researchers may sometimes conduct \"nest-to-nest\" follows, which involve observing gorilla behavior from morning (when they leave their nests), until evening (when they build and retire to their nests). Strict monitoring of health and inoculations of all visitors and workers should form part of regular routines at all gorilla sites (Adams et al., 2001) . The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International (DFGFI) has a two-week quarantine period for any researcher working with habituated gorillas (Tara Stoinski, personal communication).",

Vets and other researchers linked with the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project and the Wildlife Conservation Society (MGVP/WCS, Chapter 2, this volume) have been able to pioneer the application of conservation medicine principles to ecosystem and human health and gorilla health. This holistic ecosystem health approach recognizes the importance of health monitoring of all humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) serves as a first and most vital step in formulating a practical conservation management program for the survival and recovery (e.g., at Lossi) of gorillas in a particular country or region (Miller et al., Chapter 8, this volume) . The mountain gorilla PHVA held in Uganda stressed the importance of tourism as part of the overall conservation management strategy (Werikhe et al., 1997; Litchfield, 2001a) .",

In Australia, it is illegal to bring in meat, and 48 teams of detector dogs at Australian international airports sniff out such items (Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2006) . Following a pilot scheme at Heathrow airport of two detector dogs, there are still only six teams of such dogs in the UK (Duggan and Jarvis, 2003; National Audit Office, 2005) .

It could be argued that survival of all gorillas may depend on a more collaborative regional or transboundary approach (ECOFAC lowland gorilla tourism sites already collaborate), which allows investment costs to be shared (e.g., training, marketing, and policy development), potentially leading to increases in tourism revenue and avoidance of competition between sites (Lanjouw et al., 2001) .
