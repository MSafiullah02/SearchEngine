Driven by conformational plasticity, RNA elements can assume alternative forms required for different biological functions (Dethoff et al., 2012; Simon and Gehrke, 2009). For example, riboswitches in untranslated regions (UTRs) of bacterial genes can cycle between active and inactive conformations through binding to small metabolites, thereby inhibiting translation or attenuating transcription of downstream genes (Soukup and Soukup, 2004; Winkler and Breaker, 2003). Regulatory RNA elements found in viral RNA genomes can also switch between mutually exclusive conformations to regulate incompatible processes such as translation and replication (D'Souza and Summers, 2004; Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001; Patel et al., 2015; Simon and Gehrke, 2009; Stammler et al., 2011; Stupina et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009).",

            "text": "To gain insights into how RNAs transition between alternative conformations, we have studied the folding and unfolding pathways of a 3\u2019 cap-independent translation enhancer (3\u2019CITE) found in the 3\u00b4 UTR of TCV. TCV is a positive-strand RNA virus (genus Carmovirus, family Tombusviridae) with a single uncapped, non-poly(A) genome of 4053 nt encoding five proteins (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). The TCV 3\u2019UTR contains at least five hairpins (H4, H4a, H4b, H5 and Pr) and three critical H-type pseudoknots (\u03a81, \u03a82, \u03a83) (McCormack et al., 2008; Simon and Miller, 2013), a type of RNA structure that forms when loop residues in a hairpin pair with nearby residues to create a second stem-loop. The coaxially stacked double pseudoknots H4a/\u03a83 and H4b/\u03a82 in conjunction with hairpin H5 fold into a T-shaped structure known as the TSS (McCormack et al., 2008). The TSS serves as a 3\u2019CITE by binding to 80S ribosomes at the P-site through an interaction with the 60S ribosomal subunit (Stupina et al., 2008). Substituting the entire TSS or H4a/\u03a83/H4b with the analogous regions from the related Cardamine chlorotic fleck virus (CCFV) led to viral genomic (g)RNA accumulation that was similar to or greater than wild-type (wt) TCV. In contrast, TCV gRNA accumulated poorly when individual hairpins or other combinations of CCFV hairpins and pseudoknots were substituted. These results suggested that all, or a specific subset of hairpins and pseudoknots, function as a structural domain or subdomain (McCormack et al., 2008).",

The TSS region is also important for replication of a small, non-translated satellite RNA (satC) that contains two TCV-derived 3\u2019 regions (Zhang et al., 2006a, 2006b). The basal TSS conformation did not change substantially when bound to ribosomes (Stupina et al., 2011), but was significantly altered when a 3\u2019UTR fragment (252 nt) or a 320 nt 3\u2019 terminal fragment was bound by the RdRp (Yuan et al., 2009, 2012). Prominent changes included enhanced flexibility of: (1) hairpin H3 in the coat protein ORF and adjacent upstream sequences; (2) the terminal loop of hairpin H4 located just upstream of the TSS; and (3) H4a/\u03a83 in the TSS. Sequences with reduced flexibility included: (1) the 5\u2019 side of the basal stem of H5; (2) the sequence between H4b and H5; and (3) the A-rich sequence upstream of H4a. These findings suggested that a mechanism exists for the TSS to transition between conformations required for translation and replication after a threshold level of RdRp was available.",

For this current report, optical tweezers (OT), a type of single molecule force spectroscopy, and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD) were used to examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the TSS. Our results indicate that the TSS follows an unexpected folding pathway that can be reproduced by SMD for conditions that exclude Mg2+. In the absence of Mg2+, H4b unfolded first, followed by H5 and then H4a/\u03a83, which had been predicted to be the least stable element. In the presence of Mg2+, H4b unfolded cooperatively with H5, followed by H4a/\u03a83. Mg2+ was not required to form H4a/\u03a83 but enhanced the stability of H4a/\u03a83 and all other elements tested. Disrupting H4a/\u03a83 eliminated the cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5, and H4a/\u03a83 was unstable in the absence of the upstream stretch of five adenylates. Mutating two of these adenylates or adjacent downstream residues eliminated specific binding of RdRp to a 3\u2019UTR fragment, suggesting a model where binding of the RdRp to the five adenylate region disrupts H4a/\u03a83, leading to loss of interaction between H5 and H4b and promoting the conformational switch that interrupts translation and promotes replication.",

A truncated version of this fragment that terminated precisely at the two pseudoknots and omitted the upstream five adenylates (5A) (positions 11 to 110 in Figure 1A) was subsequently used to determine the TSS structure by NMR and SAXS (Zuo et al., 2010). This shorter fragment was not initially stable, and stability required addition of two guanylates at the 5\u2019 end that extended \u03a83 and disrupted hairpin H4a. One possibility for why the TSS-only fragment was not stable was the omission of the upstream 5A, as it was subsequently shown that adjacent doublet mutations in 5A (positions 8 and 9 in Figure 1A) or single mutations disrupting \u03a83 caused identical enhancements in flexibility of residues throughout the 5A/H4a/\u03a83 region as assayed by in-line structure probing (Yuan et al., 2009). For this reason, the longer 118 nt fragment (TSS118) that included 5A was used for most of the current study.",

To define the importance of individual adenylates, each was mutated to one or two other nucleotides and mutant gRNAs were assayed for accumulation in protoplasts. Alterations of individual adenylates reduced gRNA levels to between 23% and 55% of wt (Figure 1B). Since A11 could potentially participate in \u03a83 by pairing with U26, it was altered to both a cytidylate, which should disrupt the base-pair and a guanylate, which might maintain the pairing with a G:U pair. A11toC was among the least detrimental of the single nucleotide alterations, reducing accumulation by 45% whereas A11toG reduced accumulation by 65%. These results suggest that the reduction in gRNA accumulation due to alteration of A11 is not connected to its involvement (if any) with \u03a83.",

In-line probing reports on the flexibility of individual residues since nucleophilic attack of a ribose 2\u2019OH on the backbone phosphate and ensuing backbone cleavage requires residue flexibility to assume in-line geometry (Soukup and Breaker, 1999). As shown in Figures 1A,C and D, flexible residues were mainly found in TSS terminal and internal loops. \u03a83, which was originally identified by generating several different compensatory mutations in full-length gRNA, was not resolved by in-line probing of TSS118, similar to what was previously found when subjecting larger fragments to in-line probing and full-length gRNA to SHAPE structure probing (Chattopadhyay et al., 2015; McCormack et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009).",

As shown in Figures 1C and D, and quantified in Figure 1F, selected residues in the 5A region and surrounding sequences of 5AtoU, as well as residues within the H4a loop, displayed flexibility differences of >25% compared with wt. This result is similar to what was found previously when only two adenylates (positions 8 and 9) were mutated within a larger fragment (Yuan et al., 2009). In addition, several residues within the large symmetrical loop of H5 and one residue in the linker between H4b and H5 displayed >25% altered flexibility in 5AtoU. Although the 5U in 5AtoU could potentially pair with the five adenylates within the H5 internal loop, only one of the H5 adenylates displayed reduced flexibility, suggesting that structural changes in H5 were not due to an inadvertent pairing opportunity. These results suggest that the TSS forms a similar structure within TSS118 as previously found in longer fragments (McCormack et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009) and that 5A appears to be involved in stabilizing the structure of (at least) H4a/\u03a83.",

            "text": "Genetic analyses and biochemical probing in the presence and absence of RdRp indicated that the TSS and surrounding sequences adopt two substantially different conformations: a basal conformation in the absence of the RdRp that includes the TSS and is likely involved in translation, and an alternative conformation in the presence of the RdRp with a disrupted TSS that is likely used for transcription (Stupina et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2009). To investigate this further, we examined the unfolding/folding behavior and stability (i.e., resistance to pulling force) of single TSS molecules under the induction of force using optical tweezers, a form of single molecule force spectroscopy that can be used to investigate conformational changes in single RNAs (Green et al., 2008; Greenleaf et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006; Liphardt et al., 2001; Ritchie and Woodside, 2015). TSS118 was joined to 500-nt RNA handles at its 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, which were made double stranded after hybridization to complementary DNA tagged with biotin or digoxigenin (DIG). The biotin DNA handle was attached to a streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead and the DIG DNA handle was attached to an anti-digoxigenin (AD)-coated bead. The streptavidin bead was held in place by a micropipette fixed on a glass chamber and the AD bead was held in an optical trap, which allowed the location of the focal point of the trap to be moved by a piezo (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). By moving the focal point of the optical trap mechanically, the AD bead was pulled away from the pipette, allowing the connected single-stranded TSS to unfold. Alternatively, the AD bead in the optical trap was repositioned proximal to the pipette, leading to TSS refolding (Tinoco et al., 2006; Vilfan et al., 2007). This non-equilibrium measurement is known as force ramping.",

In the absence of Mg2+, the TSS was expected to unfold with three transitions, corresponding to hairpins H4a, H4b, and H5. At low force (<10 pN), the force- extension curve (FEC) showed monotonic extension of the DNA/RNA handles (Figure 2A and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2), indicating that a single molecule was being stretched. At higher force, three transitions (termed \u2018rips\u2019) labeled \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019, and \u20183\u2019 appeared in stepwise fashion, corresponding to successive unfolding of three TSS structural elements (Figure 2A, red line). No rips were observed when the force exceeded 20 pN (data not shown). When the force was released, the TSS refolded in three successive steps corresponding to its three unfolding transitions (3, 2, and 1; Figure 2A, blue line). Differences in the force required to unfold and fold the individual elements signified hysteric characteristics of the two processes due to the slow unfolding/folding rate of the molecule as compared to the fast loading rate of the applied force, suggesting that these transitions were taking place outside of their thermal equilibrium.",

The predicted \u0394G\u2019s (in kcals/mole) were H4a: \u22126.9; H4b: \u22129.2; H5: \u221221.8; H4a/\u03a83: \u22128.3; and H4b/\u03a82: \u221211.0. Since the dynamic unfolding behaviors of RNA hairpins and pseudoknots also depend on kinetic barriers to unfolding force, rip assignments required using complementary oligonucleotides to disrupt individual hairpins. In the absence of Mg2+, disrupting H4b eliminated rip 1 (Figure 2C), and disrupting H5 eliminated rip 2 (Figure 2D). In the presence of Mg2+, disrupting either H4b or H5 resulted in FECs without rip 1*. Rips 2 and 3 were present when H4b was disrupted and rips 1 and 3 were present when H5 was disrupted. These results strongly suggest: (1) in the absence of Mg2+, rip 1 and rip 2 correspond to unfolding of H4b and H5, respectively; and (2) in the presence of Mg2+, H4b and H5 unfold cooperatively as rip 1*, which may also contain \u03a82 that connects H4b with the base of H5.",

Therefore, point mutations were introduced into H4a, generating fragment mH4a (Figure 2F). When mH4a was subjected to OT in the presence and absence of Mg2+, rip 3 (the most stable transition) was eliminated (Figure 2F). This suggests that the unusual stability of H4a/\u03a83 (compared to its predicted value) in the presence or absence of Mg2+ precluded oligonucleotide annealing. Since rip 3 was present in the absence of Mg2+ (Figure 2A), Mg2+ was not required for H4a/\u03a83 folding, similar to the ribosome recoding pseudoknot of Barley western yellows virus (BWYV) (Grilley et al., 2006). In addition, in Mg2+, disruption of H4a by point mutations caused rip 1* to apparently be replaced with rips 1 and 2, suggesting that H4a/\u03a83 is required for cooperative association of H4b and H5. These results indicate that: (1) in the absence of Mg2+, the TSS unfolds in the order of H4b, H5, and H4a/\u03a83; (2) in the presence of Mg2+, the unfolding order is the H4b/H5 complex, followed by H4a/\u03a83; (3) the H4b/H5 complex depends on the presence of H4a/\u03a83; and (4) H4a/\u03a83 is substantially more stable than predicted.",

The elements involved in each transition in the extension vs time curves were identified by their disappearance followed hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides (for H4b and H5) or mutations in H4a/\u03a83 (data not shown). At critical force levels, in the absence of Mg2+, three hopping transitions were observed when TSS118 was held at constant force for 1.5 to 2 min, consistent with the three transitions found by force ramping (H4b, H5 and H4a/\u03a83) (Figure 4A). In the absence of Mg2+, H4b unfolded at 10 to 13.5 pN, H5 at 13 to 15.5 pN, and H4a/\u03a83 at 14.5 to 18.5 pN (Figure 4A). Slowly increasing the force extended the time the hairpins spent in the unfolded state. For example, H4b spent less than 20% of its time in an unfolded state at 11.5 pN, 96% of the time at 13 pN and 100% at 14 pN and higher. Mg2+ increased the mechanical stability of all TSS elements, with H4b now unfolding between 13 and 16.5 pN; H5 from 14.5 to 17.5 pN; and H4a/\u03a83 from 16.5 to 18 pN (Figure 4B; the slightly higher unfolding force [19.95 \u00b1 0.06 pN] of H4a/\u03a83 obtained by force ramping might be due to the effect of the force loading rate [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2]). In addition, cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5 was only observed in the presence of Mg2+ (hops labeled with asterisks in Figure 4B and not observed in Figure 4A). Mg2+ also caused abrupt changes in the hopping behavior of H4b and H4a/\u03a83. The unfolded state for H4b was less than 1% of the total time at 15 pN, changing to 40% at 15.5 pN, and was nearly 100% at 16 pN (Figure 4B). For H4a/\u03a83in Mg2+, the unfolded state was less than 1% of the total time at 17.5 pN and 100% of total time at 18 pN (Figure 3B). These results show that unfolding of H4b and H4a/\u03a83 in Mg2+ reflects brittle behavior, meaning that in the presence of Mg2+, the distance from the unfolded state of these elements is much closer to their transition states.",

Since the TSS is a central hub for RNA interactions within the 3\u2019UTR and upstream sequences (Yuan et al., 2012), it seemed possible that the widespread conformational rearrangement could be triggered by RdRp binding to, and disrupting, the TSS. One consequence of RdRp binding to fragments containing the TSS was reduced flexibility of 5A residues, suggesting that this motif might be a target site for the RdRp (Yuan et al., 2009). To assess the validity of this hypothesis, RdRp filter binding assays were conducted on an extended 3\u2019 fragment (positions 3858 to 4053) to determine if binding dissociation constants were affected by mutations in 5A. Recombinant TCV RdRp bound to the wt fragment with a Kd = 2.6 \u03bcM (Figure 7). In contrast, RdRp did not exhibit specific one-site binding to MDV (midivariant RNA, 221 nt), which is a non-template satellite RNA associated with Q\u03b2 bacteriophage. A two nucleotide mutation in 5A at positions 8 and 9 (A to U; m74) prevented specific binding of RdRp to the fragment. Loss of specific binding supports our previous finding that m74 also reduced RdRp-directed in vitro transcription of this fragment by 3.6-fold (Yuan et al., 2009). The ability of the RdRp to continue transcribing low levels of complementary strands in the absence of 5A binding is likely due to the presence of the 3\u2019 terminal Pr hairpin, which in combination with upstream hairpin H4 can promote a low level of transcription (Sun and Simon, 2006). Since mutations in 5A disrupt the stability of H4a/\u03a83, RNA fragments were also examined that contained mutations in \u03a83. Two individual alterations in the loop of H4a (m27, m41) improved binding of the RdRp to the template by 2.5-fold. In contrast, mutations in the two partner residues of m27 and m41 located just downstream of 5A (m26, m40) eliminated one-site binding to the template (Figure 7). These results suggest that disruption of H4a/\u03a83 (which occurs when the adenylates are altered in m74) is not the proximal cause of the loss of specific RdRp binding, but rather the RdRp may be specifically interacting with 5A and adjacent downstream sequences, and this interaction may be facilitated by the absence of \u03a83.",

However, the full extension of the TSS model required a solvent box approximately 700 \u00c5 long, resulting in a large simulated system (up-to ~480,000 atoms) and limiting the slowest pulling speed to 0.05 \u00c5/ps, (requiring three weeks to run one simulation). Therefore, computationally much faster MD method using the implicit solvent Generalized Born model (GB) was employed to explore an order of magnitude slower simulated pulling speeds. Both types of simulations used explicit or simulated concentration of monovalent Na+/Cl\u2212 counter ions. Mg2+ ions were not included as their initial placement is unknown. Furthermore, the additional level of complexity introduced by the SMD protocol would not allow sufficient time for the potential coordinating effects of Mg2+ to be established, and thus their inclusion was deemed insufficiently accurate for use in this study. Therefore, all simulation results are based on NaCl and are compared to experimental conditions in the absence of Mg2+.",

Full base-pair opening for the extension of the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends could be achieved by an additional equilibration step at the end of these simulations (i.e., with holding to maintain the extension, but without pulling) or by slowing down the pulling speed to 0.1 \u00c5/ps. These runs yielded an unfolding sequence different from the experimental results, even at the 0.05 \u00c5/ps pulling speed (resulting in the longest practical explicit solvent simulation times). The key observation based on these simulations was that pulling speed affected the orientation of helices relative to the direction of pulling (refer to Appendix 1 for more details). This led to formation of new, transient tertiary interactions by H4b after all hydrogen bonds between H4b and \u03a82 opened, increasing the resistance to pulling and impacting the order of TSS unfolding. These observations are consistent with results of OT unfolding of a pseudoknot (Chen et al., 2007). Introducing a pause in the pulling simulation immediately after \u03a82 opening to re-equilibrate the system and avoid transient H4b interactions changed the order of TSS opening events to H4b opening first, followed by H5 and then H4a.",

The resulting tertiary structure was oriented approximately in parallel with the direction of pulling.

Unfolding begins with C6 and 5A adenylates losing their initial triple interactions with \u03a83 and the extended pairing in \u03a83 (A11). Next, the stacking between H4a and H4b is opened (C34 and G35 are pulled apart). This is followed by \u03a82 opening and H4b pivoting toward vertical (perpendicular to the direction of pulling) without forming any transitional tertiary interactions and unwinding fully as the first of the major TCV TSS helices. In the next stage, the entire H5 opens. Finally, H4a/\u03a83 opens with H4a helix pairs opening from the 5\u2019\u22123\u2019 end toward the hairpin. The illustrated simulation exhibited separation of H4b from pseudoknot \u03a82 without any transient tertiary interactions, and this clean transition appears to contribute to the clearly defined sequence of events. The individual helices open sequentially, one at a time, rather than partially and in parallel (concurrently). The latter scenario was observed in many SMD simulations at all pulling speeds, although it was most pronounced at faster pulling speeds. For example, rather than \u2018waiting for its turn\u2019 to begin opening, H4a/\u03a83 opens its 5\u2019\u22123\u2019 base pair or pairs and pauses as weaker base pairs open elsewhere in the TCV. Gradual changes in the hydrogen-bond interactions that maintain the pseudoknotted 3D topology of the 5\u2019 end are similar to the case of H4b \u2018slipping\u2019 (see Appendix 1). This scenario could explain the difference between estimated (13.6 nm) and experimental (9.1 \u00b1 1.5 nm) contour length of H4a/\u03a83, which would not include any \u2018premature\u2019 base pair openings. In multiple runs, we observed partial opening of H4a/\u03a83 foreshortening the contour length, first to 11.2 nm (C12 through G30 or G13 through C31), and then to 9.4 nm (U15 through G30), after which the remaining structure opened rapidly. Similar foreshortening of the contour length was also observed for the opening simulations of H5. A pause in unzipping is predicted for the substructure between C71 and G100, followed by a rapid opening of H5, especially across the non-canonical pairing in its large internal loop. The contour length of this substructure is 17.7 nm, well within the experimental measurements. The experimentally obtained FECs indicate rapid opening (unzipping) of entire helices, one helix at a time, while our simulations include both scenarios and suggest that partial helix opening may play a role in the process.",

How the TSS along with at least 300 nt at the 3\u2019 end of the TCV gRNA convert between the two conformations is unknown. In the T-shaped structure, the TSS contains hairpin H5 in conjunction with the coaxially stacked pseudoknots H4a/\u03a83 and H4b/\u03a82 (McCormack et al., 2008). Based on Mfold-predicted \u0394G\u2019s for the three TSS hairpins, H4a (in the absence of the pseudoknot) should be the least stable element (\u0394G = \u22126.9 kcal/mol), followed by H4b (\u0394G = \u22129.2 kcal/mol), and H5 (\u0394G = \u221221.8 kcal/mol). In the absence of Mg2+, H4b unfolded experimentally between 10 and 13.5 pN, and H5 unfolded between 13 and 15.5 pN (Figures 2 and 4). In addition to H5 being substantially less stable than expected, it also has a smaller than expected contour length (15 to 17 nm compared with the expected length of 25 nm). Reduced stability of H5 may reflect instability of its lower stem (~5.9 nm) (McCormack et al., 2008), which might unfold at a lower force range, as suggested by SMD. In the absence of the lower stem, the \u0394G of H5 is predicted to be \u221214.9 kcal/mol.",

In the presence of upstream sequences, including 5A and sequences that form \u03a83, H4a/\u03a83 is the most stable TSS element and folding is independent of Mg2+ (Figures 2 and 3). High force was also necessary to unfold the human telomerase pseudoknot (Chen et al., 2007). Stability of H4a/\u03a83 was dependent upon association with the upstream 5A as the element did not form when the adenylates were converted to uridylates (Figure 3C). 5AtoU also caused structural changes in H4a/\u03a83 residues (Figure 1), similar to what was previously found when just A9 and A10 were altered, or \u03a83 was disrupted (Yuan et al., 2009).

It is therefore possible that interactions other than those proposed in the model and that are stable in MD simulations form between 5A and H4a/\u03a83. H4a/\u03a83 may also be highly stable due to its coaxially stacked stems, creating base-pair planes perpendicular to the direction of the unfolding force requiring high force to overcome resistance of multiple base pairs at the same time. Computer simulations of the unfolding pathway support this hypothesis by indicating that the structural resistance to pulling is increased for the TSS pseudoknotted motifs beyond their free energy predictions by their orientation parallel (and nearly co-axial) to the direction of pulling (along the top of the TSS\u2019s \u2018T\u2019 shape). Of the two pseudoknots, the long-distance \u03a82 is weaker than the short-distance H-type \u03a83 and opens first, exposing H4b and H5, now oriented approximately perpendicular to the direction of pulling. H4b is shorter (and has a higher predicted free energy) and opens first, followed by H5. Beside the alignment between the motif axis and the direction of pulling, akin to \u2018static resistance', we observed what could be labeled as \u2018kinetic resistance\u2019 based on the formation of transient (\u2018slipping\u2019) tertiary interaction between the helices oriented (initially or transiently) along the direction of pulling and in the proximity of other (downstream or upstream) parts of the TSS. For example, \u03a83 opens gradually and, as the entire \u03a83 motif opens, transient tertiary interactions outside of the original \u03a83 base pairs maintain the pseudoknot topology, thus increasing the resistance to pulling and delaying the opening of H4a/\u03a83.",

In Mg2+, cooperative association of H5 and H4b led to a new large rip in the FECs (1*), which unfolded at a lower force than H4a/\u03a83 (Figure 2B). In addition, stability of all three TSS transitions increased by 2 to 3 pN over the force required in the absence of Mg2+ (Figures 4 and 6), and fully stretched H4a/\u03a83 (13 nm) was only obtained in Mg2+ at high force (\u226518 pN) (Figure 5). These results imply that Mg2+ increases the kinetic barriers to the mechanical unfolding of the TSS elements. In addition, the hopping behavior of H4b and H4a/\u03a83 in Mg2+ changed abruptly between folded and unfolded states between 15.5 and 16 pN for H4b and H5, and between 17.5 pN and 18 pN for H4a/\u03a83 (Figure 4), indicating that the presence of Mg2+ increased the stability of these elements and suppressed their unfolding. This could explain the refolding dynamics of the TSS, which experimentally assumes a conformation compatible with ribosome binding in the absence of the RdRp (Yuan et al., 2009).",

For example, disruption of either H4b or H5 led to the disappearance of rip 1* (Figures 2C and D), indicating cooperative unfolding of the two hairpins. Furthermore, disruption of H5 caused H4b to unfold at 11.5 pN in the presence of Mg2+ (Figure 6B), which was the same force level as in the absence of Mg2+. In addition, alterations that disrupted H4a/\u03a83 (mH4a) converted rip 1* to the individual H4b and H5 rips (rips 1 and 2; Figure 2F), indicating that H4b/H5 cooperation required H4a/\u03a83. A connection between H5 and H4b was also previously suggested by finding second-site mutations in H4b when the lower bulge loop of H5 was mutated (McCormack, 2007). Although FECs indicated that H4a/\u03a83 was stable in the absence of H5 or H4b (Figures 2C and D and Figure 3), disruption of H5 eliminated the normal H4a/\u03a83 transition in the absence of Mg2+ (Figure 6B).",

            "text": "Our finding that RdRp binding to a 3\u2019 fragment is disrupted when 5A is mutated suggests a new model for how the TSS and surrounding sequences transition between alternative conformations. We propose that a basal conformation of the 3\u2019UTR contains the TSS, which serves as a 3\u2019CITE for translation of the RdRp from the gRNA template when the gRNA first enters a cell. When a threshold level of RdRp has been synthesized, the RdRp binds to the 5A region that includes \u03a83 residues, disrupting H4a/\u03a83, which consequently disrupts the interaction between H4b and H5. Since the TSS serves as a central hub for interactions throughout the region (Yuan et al., 2012), disruption of the TSS would likely cause additional structural changes leading to the alternative conformation of the RNA that is found upon RdRp binding. Although this site of RdRp binding is distal to the 3\u2019end where transcription commences, previous results indicated that a structural connection exists between the 3\u2019 terminus and the 5A region (Yuan et al., 2012), which could place the 3\u2019 end in a position to be accessed by the 5A-bound RdRp. We believe that this scenario provides an intriguing blueprint for possible RNA structural transitions in other viruses with 3' translation elements.",

In brief, RNA was energy minimized and then placed in a TIP3P water solvent box with RNA-charge neutralizing Na+ ions and Na+/Cl\u2212 ion pairs to simulate 0.1 M salt concentration. Throughout the explicit solvent simulations, periodic boundary conditions were employed and a cutoff of 9 \u00c5 for the non-bonded interactions was used. A time step of 2 fs was used with the SHAKE algorithm to constrain all hydrogen bonds in the system. The Berendsen thermostat was used to maintain the temperature and the Berendsen algorithm was used to maintain pressure at 1.0 Pa (Berendsen et al., 1984). A multi-step equilibration protocol including heating to 300 K, short dynamics phases, and multiple minimization phases with gradually decreasing harmonic restraints applied to the RNA molecule was followed by an unrestrained production MD simulation of 40 ns.",

The much smaller size of the simulated system also permitted the use of the fast Amber PMEMD module. The GB-based SMD simulations were performed with constant pulling speeds of 0.01 \u00c5/ps and 0.005 \u00c5/ps, with three variants of intrinsic Born radii parameters: GB (mbondi, igb = 1), GB-HCT (mbondi, offset = 0.13 \u00c5, igb = 1) (Gaillard and Case, 2011; Hawkins et al., 1995; Tsui and Case, 2000a) and the latest GB-neck2 (mbondi3, igb = 8) (Nguyen et al., 2015). The Langevin thermostat was employed with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps\u22121 and no cutoff. Simulations were run at 300 K, with a two fs time step, SHAKE, and a Debye-H\u00fcckel salt screening concentration of 1.0. No explicit ions were used. The equilibration protocol used for all the GB runs started with energy minimization, followed by heating to 300 K with harmonic restraints of 15 kcal/mol/\u00c52 applied to the RNA and six MD stages with harmonic restraints gradually lowered to 0.1 kcal/mol/\u00c52 for the total equilibration time of 2.0 ns. SMD runs that followed the equilibration phase extended TSS108 up to 700 \u00c5 in 63.4 and 126.8 ns, depending on the simulated pulling speed. In addition to the SMD runs, the overall stability of the TSS108 model was verified in implicit solvent unrestrained MD simulations with all GB parameter variants at time scales equal to and longer than those employed in SMD.",

(F) Enlarged alternative pseudoknot/knot conformation showing aligned structure snapshots taken between 55 and 92 ns time points in the SMD run. Overall the structure and its minor variants persisted from ~42 to 104 ns of the SMD trajectory. The resulting tertiary structure is oriented approximately coaxially with the direction of pulling, and even though topologically it is a pseudoknot, the 5\u2019-end of the opening helix H4b is pulled through a loop (as if it was a true knot in 3D) that increases the number of opportunistic interactions. These add to the transient bonds formed by the \u2018slipping\u2019 hairpin loop of the horizontally oriented H4b as the whole structure is pulled apart, and offer more resistance to pulling than H4a/\u03a83, which is not \u2018knotted\u2019 in this way in 3D. In the absence of a new pseudoknot substituting for \u03a82 interactions with H4b, it is H4a/\u03a83 that offers the most resistance to pulling and opens last.
