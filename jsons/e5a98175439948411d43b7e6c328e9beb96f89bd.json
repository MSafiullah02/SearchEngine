These efforts range from increased social awareness and social distancing (Sweden) to full country-wide lockdowns (Singapore, most of Europe, many states in the US). The effectiveness of various policies in containing the spread of the disease is still being studied by researchers. In this paper, using WiFi data collected directly from the infrastructure, we present a detailed analysis of the impact of COVID-19 related policies on the staff and students of three different college campuses. Two of these campuses are in Singapore, while the third is in the Northeastern United States. Our study focuses on two different key metrics, 1) Occupancy, defined as the number of people in a building, on average, in a specific hour, and 2) Mobility, defined as the number of places visited by an individual, on average, in a specific hour. We use these two metrics since they provide a strong indicator of how likely it is for COVID-19 to spread if there is an outbreak. Our results show that online learning, split-team, and other space management policies are effective at lowering Occupancy. However, they do not change the Mobility patterns for individuals who are still moving around. Reducing Mobility requires introducing strict stay-at-home or lockdown orders, but doing so increases Occupancy in residential spaces. We present our results and then discuss the implications of the findings for policymakers.",

Singapore was initially very successful at controlling the spread of COVID-19 , by following an incremental approach to social distancing involving a variety of social controls such as splitting work teams and having returning residents stay at home [29] . This strategy allowed the economy to continue running while still providing effective COVID-19 control measures.",

Mobility shows how likely it is for a COVID-19 outbreak to spread beyond the infected individual's home and work environment. In particular, if an infected individual has a high mobility or is close to other individuals with high mobility, an outbreak will likely spread to all those places that are visited by the high mobility individuals. Indeed, the movement of individuals either visiting a country or returning home was the primary vector through which COVID-19 spread throughout the world.",

Two campuses are full-sized residential campuses with over 200 buildings each and \u224840K to 50K students and staff while the last university is a small boutique non-residential establishment with \u2248 10,000 students and staff spread across a handful of buildings. All three universities run Aruba-equipment supplied WiFi networks with one university also running a Ciscoequipment supplied WiFi network in addition to an Aruba network. For the Aruba networks, we pulled the WiFi data directly from the infrastructure using either real-time location services (RTLS) APIs [18] or by reading the system logs directly. For the Cisco network, we pulled WiFi data directly from the network using the Cisco Connected Devices (CMX) Location API v3 [25] (recently rebranded as Cisco DNA Spaces). In all cases, we obtained the following information: for all associated WiFi devices, the timestamp when the associated device was seen, the BSSID of the Access Point (AP) that saw the device, and the hashed client MAC address of the associated device. For two of the campuses, we can also obtain the same information (time seen, BSSID that saw the device, and hashed client MAC) for unassociated devices as well -i.e. devices with WiFi on that are just scanning.",

From that point on, Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) has mandated a series of escalating control policies to prevent high infection rates of COVID-19 while minimizing significant disruptions to the daily routines of its residents. The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was reported on 22nd January, and more cases started appearing over the next few days. As shown in the subsequent phases (P S 1 to P S 4), Singapore's MOH took increasingly strong measures to contain the spread of infection. These measures included mandatory stay-at-home quarantine orders for visitors, moving all academic programs online, to enforcing country-wide stay-at-home orders. Additionally, numerous facilities across Singapore were re-purposed as quarantine centres. For this analysis, several dormitory blocks at the SI N 2 campus were re-purposed for this use in early May 2020 [22] .",

This step reduced the overall occupancy (as shown in Figure 1 and decreasing Transition count for P S 2 in Figure 3 ). However, the actual mobility rate has not decreased as, even though the total number of people on campus had decreased, the number of buildings that each person visited had not. This is understandable as the work that each person on campus had to do remained the same -requiring them to visit the same set of buildings that they had to previously.

The population densities at these dormitories were very high, and the first cases of COVID-19 were reported on April 1st 2020 [15] . This spread grew very fast and resulted in thousands of infections within the dormitories within just a few weeks [13] . Fortunately, the strict quarantine policies, enacted just a few days (on 7th April 2020) after the first dorm infection (on 1st April 2020) when the authorities realised the potential for the spread to grow out of control, ensured that the virus was contained within the dormitories. For example, while the infection rate remains high in the worker dormitories, the number of cases in the rest of Singapore is almost non-existent -on May 15th 2020, 791 new infection cases were discovered in the worker dorms with just one other case discovered across the rest of Singapore [12] . Thus, while quarantine policies can lead to higher local transmission rates, the significantly reduced mobility stops the virus from spreading beyond the local area.",

We use similar techniques as prior work and apply it to understand the occupancy and mobility patterns of staff and students across our three campuses. Our goal is to help advise policy makers about the effect of various COVID-19 related decisions. This is particularly important as every country is grappling with COVID-19 and enacting a slew of policies that they believe are best for them [19] . But how do you know if these policies are effective? To help, there have been several online COVID-19 trackers that show the number of infections per country [2, 4, 20, 27] . In addition, there has also been more focused COVID-19 analysis such as the analysis of an office block in South Korea [21] , analysis of possible ways to exit lockdown across the world [28] , the rate of spread of COVID-19 in China [24] , and brief analysis of campus behaviour in Italy [3] . We add to this growing body of work by providing detailed analysis using data from three different campuses (two of which are quite large) that shows the clear effect that various policies have, over two months, on the occupancy and mobility at these campuses.",
