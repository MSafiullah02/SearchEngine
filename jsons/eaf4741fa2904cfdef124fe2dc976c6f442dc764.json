HCV, like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2), is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus, which leads to liver injury [1] . Overall, it seems that metformin could be helpful in reducing insulin resistance in subjects infected by those viruses, thus affecting the cellular response to the infections [9] [10] [11] . For this positive result, it seems that the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is responsible, which could become beneficial for the infected subject [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, according to a randomised controlled trial, metformin therapy reduces liver fibrosis in patients with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HCV [11] . Additionally, some studies have shown that it could also have a protective role on the liver [10, 12] . Of relevance, SARS-Cov 2 may lead to liver dysfunction [13, 14] , allowing the speculation that metformin could be shown to offer some liver protection in DM subjects with COVID 19.",

Interestingly, this agent has proven to be helpful in the management of viral diseases [16, 17] . In a randomised controlled trial, pioglitazone reduced HCV viral load, even in subjects who did not receive specific antiviral treatment [17] . Furthermore, pioglitazone is a drug of choice for non-alcoholic fatty liver [18, 19] . Taken together, this evidence appears to encourage, at least in theory, new therapeutic vistas for pioglitazone in COVID 19 treatment, indicating an option to improve liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, there is a considerably long way to go before this assumption is substantiated.",
