Exacerbations are intermittent episodes of increased respiratory symptoms and worse pulmonary function that may be accompanied by fever and other constitutional symptoms. These episodes contribute significantly to the morbidity associated with COPD, and in advanced disease, they are also the most frequent cause of death 1., 2., 3.. The frequency of exacerbations varies widely between patients. Though severity of airflow obstruction is correlated with the frequency of exacerbations, other yet poorly understood factors predispose some patients to have more frequent exacerbations.",

Following an exacerbation, acute symptoms usually subside over 2\u20133 weeks, however, quality of life indices takes several months to return to baseline. Furthermore, recurrent exacerbations are clearly associated with a more rapid decline in quality of life in COPD [6]. Based on studies performed by Fletcher and Peto in the 1960s it was widely believed that exacerbations do not contribute to the decline in lung function (measured as FEV1). Recent data has disputed these results and shown that the frequency of exacerbations is associated with accelerated long-term decline in lung function, in both mild COPD and more advanced diseases 7., 8..",

Substantial progress has been made in understanding their etiology and pathogenesis of exacerbations. In contrast, such richness of data is unfortunately missing in the field of clinical management of exacerbations. Major modalities used to treat exacerbations include bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Only for systemic corticosteroid use in severe exacerbations requiring emergency room care or hospitalization is the adequate clinical trial data available. Adequately powered, well-designed clinical trials studies for the other modalities used to treat exacerbations are relatively few. Consequently, whether the use of antibiotics for exacerbations is appropriate is still debated and whether antibiotic choice makes a difference is even more controversial 9., 10..",

Unfortunately, for exacerbations of COPD, the current definitions are imprecise, variable, and lack objective measures [11]. There are two widely used definitions of exacerbation. In 1987, in a large placebo-controlled trial in exacerbations of COPD, Anthonisen and colleagues defined exacerbations based on the presence of one or more of the three cardinal symptoms, including an increase or new onset of dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence [12]. When only one cardinal symptom is present, then one or more supporting symptoms or signs are required to make the diagnosis, including an upper respiratory tract infection in the past 5 days, wheezing, cough, fever without an obvious source, or a 20% increase in the respiratory rate or heart rate above baseline. Though simple and clinically useful, this definition does have several limitations. It is narrow in its scope, and several important symptoms of exacerbation such as cough, chest congestion, chest tightness, fatigue, and sleep disturbance are not included. It is subjective, however, that limitation applies to all definitions of exacerbations as reliable objective measures of exacerbations are currently unavailable.",

This definition though more inclusive of symptoms of an exacerbation, is not specific with regard to the nature and duration of symptoms. It lacks objective measures. Longitudinal cohort studies with daily recording of symptoms have revealed that a significant proportion, up to 50%, of episodes of increased symptoms are not reported by patients to their health care providers and therefore are not associated with additional treatment.

In our clinical studies, we suspect an exacerbation when a patient with COPD reports a minor increase (or new onset) of two or a major increase (or new onset) of one of the following respiratory symptoms: dyspnea, cough, sputum production, sputum tenacity, sputum purulence [13]. The increase in symptoms should be of at least 24 h duration and should be of greater intensity than their normal day-to-day variability.

However, currently our determination of severity of exacerbations is imprecise, and like the diagnosis, is determined in a variable manner among studies. The severity of an exacerbation is a complicated concept, determined by at least two factors, the severity of the underlying COPD and the acute change induced by the exacerbation. A severe exacerbation may therefore be assessed when a patient with very severe underlying COPD has a relatively small change from his baseline, or when a patient with mild COPD has much larger acute change in his symptoms and lung function.

However, spirometry and lung volumes are difficult to measure accurately during exacerbations, especially severe episodes. With simpler measures, such as peak flow, often the change with an exacerbation is of the same magnitude as its day-to-day variability. Severity has been also measured by site of care, with hospitalized exacerbations regarded as severe, outpatient exacerbations regarded as moderate and self medicated exacerbations as mild [14]. Site of care is unreliable as a measure of exacerbation severity. Though the major factor determining site of care is undoubtedly illness severity, it is also dependent on differences in hospital admission practices among countries and health care systems, patient reporting of exacerbations, physician preferences, etc. The intensity of recommended treatment has also been used as a measure of severity of exacerbations, with treatment with bronchodilators only indicating mild exacerbations, while treatment with antibiotics and steroids in addition to bronchodilators regarded as indicating moderate or severe exacerbations. Such measurement of severity is beset with the same problems of preferences and practice approach as discussed above.",

This classification relies on the number of cardinal symptoms and the presence of some supporting symptoms (Table 53.2\n). Though not developed as a severity classification, it has become so over time. Advantages of this determination of severity are its simplicity and that it correlates with benefit with antibiotics, with such benefit seen only in Type 1 and 2 exacerbations. Limitations include its lack of validation against objective measures of severity and that its ability to predict benefit with antibiotics has not been consistent in other studies. Another limitation is the lack of gradation of severity within each symptom, such that a Type 2 exacerbation with mild changes in two cardinal symptoms would be regarded as the same severity in this classification as an exacerbation with a marked increase in both symptoms.",

In another study of multiple serum biomarkers in 20 hospitalized patients with exacerbation, reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) correlated with decrease in dyspnea during recovery from exacerbation, while decreases in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) were proportional to recovery in FEV1\n[16].

The intensity of neutrophilic inflammation, when measured as associated cytokines/chemokines (IL-8, TNF-\u03b1) and products of neutrophil degranulation (NE and myeloperoxidase), is much greater in well-characterized bacterial exacerbations than exacerbations of nonbacterial etiology [18]. Systemic inflammation, measured as serum CRP is also more intense in bacterial exacerbations [18]. These findings have important implications. They can form the basis for biomarkers to distinguish etiology of exacerbations in a reliable and rapid manner, facilitating appropriate therapy. The heightened airway and systemic inflammation with bacterial exacerbations can be potentially damaging to the lungs. Effective antibiotic therapy to eradicate the bacteria responsible for exacerbations and reduce the inflammation to baseline levels becomes desirable and could have potential long-term benefits in COPD.",

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the dominant mucosal pathogen in cystic fibrosis and noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis [39]. These mucosal infections have been related to anatomical abnormalities with impaired drainage of secretions, antecedent viral infections and defects in innate and adaptive immunity. All these predisposing factors likely exist in COPD. NTHI, S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis are exclusively human pathogens. Their usual environmental niche in healthy humans is confined to the upper airway which they usually colonize without any clinical manifestations. Acquisition of these pathogens in COPD, because of compromised lung defense, allows establishment of infection in the upper as well as the lower respiratory tract (below the vocal cords). Infection of the lower respiratory tract in COPD can be with or without overt clinical manifestations, the former being addressed as exacerbation while the latter as colonization.",

The current model of bacterial exacerbation pathogenesis involves both host and pathogen factors (Fig. 53.1\n). Acquisition of strains of bacterial pathogens that are new to the host from the environment is the primary event that puts the patient with COPD at risk for an exacerbation [13]. Variation among strains of a species in the surface antigenic structure, as is seen with NTHI, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and P. aeruginosa, is crucial to the development of recurrent exacerbations with these pathogens. This variation allows these newly acquired strains to escape the pre-existing host immune response that had developed following prior exposure to other strains of the same species. These newly acquired strains can therefore proliferate in the lower airways and induce acute inflammation. The virulence of the strain and as yet unidentified host factors may determine if the acute inflammatory response to the pathogen reaches the threshold to cause symptoms that present as an exacerbation [40]. In the majority of instances, mucosal and systemic antibodies develop to the pathogen 41., 42.. This immune response, in combination with appropriate antibiotics, eliminates or controls proliferation of the infecting bacteria. However, because of antigenic variability among strains of these bacterial species, these antibodies directed at the infecting strain are usually strain-specific, and do not protect the host from antigenically distinct strains of the same species. This allows recurrent bacterial infection and exacerbations in these patients.",

In vitro, viruses can damage airway epithelium, stimulate muscarinic receptors, and induce eosinophil and neutrophil influx [44]. Whether these pro-inflammatory actions are enhanced in epithelial cells from patients with COPD is not known. Bronchial epithelial cells obtained from patients with asthma have diminished production of interferons and increased ICAM-1 expression, changes which could result in increased inflammation, cell lysis, and viral replication on viral infection. Increased ICAM-1 expression in COPD bronchial epithelium has been seen, however the other changes have not been described.",

Practical application of these biological goals of treatment of exacerbations awaits the development of biomarkers that provide simple, rapid and reliable measurements of inflammation and infection.",

In this analysis, the number needed to treat in severe exacerbations in hospitalized patients to prevent one death was only three patients and the number needed to treat to prevent one clinical failure was six patients.

However, there remains considerable controversy as to antibiotic choice, especially for initial empiric therapy of exacerbations 14., 50., 51., 52., 61.. Most exacerbations nowadays are treated without obtaining sputum bacteriology and with the trend to short course antibiotic therapy, this initial empiric choice often becomes the only choice made of antibiotics in exacerbations. Results of antibiotic comparison trials should guide the recommendations for appropriate empiric antibiotics in exacerbations. However, though the literature is replete with such trials, in the vast majority, antibiotic choice does not apparently affect the clinical outcome. However, differences in bacteriological eradication rates among antibiotics are seen, with a dissociation between clinical and bacteriological outcomes [62]. These results are contrary to expectations that antibiotics with better in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy and better pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics should show superior clinical outcomes. A closer examination of the trial design of these studies reveals several shortcomings that offer potential explanations for this paradox (Table 53.5\n) [53]. Many of these deficiencies are related to the fact that these trials are performed for regulatory approval of the drugs, therefore are designed for demonstrating noninferiority rather than differences between the two antibiotics. In the face of this large body of data showing clinical equivalence, it is not surprising that several guidelines do not differentiate between antibiotics for therapy of exacerbations.",

They identified 12 randomized controlled trials that had enrolled 2261 patients, 10 of these trials included the penicillins as the first-line antibiotic. Only a single trial each with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline was included. In the clinically evaluable patients, first-line antibiotics were only half as effective as second-line antibiotics with an odds ratio for clinical treatment success of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.34\u20130.75). This result was consistent in several sensitivity analyses, with the exception of trials published before 1991, where the difference between first line and second line antibiotics was not seen.

Patients in this study were randomized to a fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin or to standard therapy (which could be one of the following: amoxicillin, cefuroxime or clarithromycin) [66]. Several unique design features of this trial are noteworthy, which relate to observations made in this study and set the standard for future antibiotic comparison trials in this disease. The number of patients enrolled was much larger than previous studies, in order to provide adequate power to demonstrate superiority. Patients were enrolled when stable to establish a baseline as a comparison to reliably distinguish between clinical improvement (enough improvement that no additional antibiotic treatment is required) from clinical cure (improvement of symptoms to baseline) following treatment. A substantial proportion of the patients enrolled had one or more risk factors that would predispose to a poor outcome as discussed below. Patients were followed up to 9 months after randomization to provide an estimate of recurrence of exacerbation.",

Several other a priori unconventional end-points were examined. Moxifloxacin treatment resulted in significantly fewer courses of additional antibiotic therapy (8% versus 14%) and an extended time to the next exacerbation (131 versus 104 days) [66]. A composite end-point of clinical failure, requirement of additional antibiotics and recurrence of exacerbation demonstrated a clear difference between the two arms, with moxifloxacin being statistically superior to standard therapy for up to 5 months of follow-up.

These studies have also demonstrated that certain patient characteristics that antedate the onset of the exacerbation impact the outcome of the exacerbation 48., 67., 68., 69., 70., 71.. Interestingly, several of these characteristics, such as co-morbid cardiac disease and frequent exacerbations, were found to be relevant to outcome in more than one study. These risk factors for poor outcome should be considered in the decision regarding choice of empiric antibiotics when treating exacerbations. In theory, patients at risk for poor outcome would have the greatest benefit from early aggressive antibiotic therapy, such as with the fluoroquinolones. These are the patients in whom the consequences of treatment with an antibiotic ineffective against the pathogen causing the exacerbation are likely to be significant, with clinical failures, hospitalizations and early recurrences likely. These at risk patients contribute substantially to the overall poor clinical outcomes of exacerbations. Therefore, targeting these patients with potentially more effective treatment is likely to have a significant impact on the overall outcomes of exacerbations.",

It is likely that home oxygen use, hypercapnia and chronic steroid use mainly reflect increasing severity of underlying COPD. Acute bronchodilator use could either be related to the severity of underlying COPD or reflect the wheezy phenotype of exacerbation that would be less responsive to antibiotic treatment. Many of these risk factors are continuous in severity, however, certain thresholds have been defined in studies that are clinically useful and predictive of poor outcome and easier to use clinically.

            "text": "Patients with COPD exacerbation often experience a change in the color of sputum from white or gray (mucoid) to yellow, green or brown (purulent). Purulence of sputum is related to the presence of myeloperoxidase, a product of neutrophil degranulation. Neutrophil degranulation is associated with bacterial infection, therefore sputum purulence at exacerbation is a marker of bacterial infection, defined by quantitative cultures of sputum and bronchoscopic protected brush specimens 75., 76.. Presence of sputum purulence has been advocated as the sole determinant for antibiotic treatment of exacerbations. However, its accuracy and reproducibility as an indicator of bacterial infection is limited, and is likely to be even more so in clinical practice than in research studies 75., 76.. Often, patients have purulent sputum production even when stable, have intermittent purulent sputum production during exacerbation, or have not have observed the sputum color. Sputum purulence is one of the cardinal Anthonisen criteria, and we recommend it should be used in conjunction with other symptoms and other measures of risk stratification in antibiotic treatment of exacerbations (Fig 53.2).",

Several potential biomarkers have been identified in sputum and serum. The best studied biomarker of bacterial infection is serum procalcitonin level. In a recent study in patients hospitalized for exacerbations, antibiotic treatment was only recommended if the procalcitonin level was above a certain threshold. There was no difference in outcomes in spite of reduction in antibiotic use from 72% to 40% with procalcitonin guidance [77]. However, this approach needs to be validated in multi-center trials with varied populations before widespread application [78]. Furthermore, it needs to be tested in outpatients which represent the majority of exacerbations treated, where patients are not as closely supervised and other supportive care is less rigorous. Only a minority of patients received a fluoroquinolone in this study, which should have been the antibiotics of choice in these complicated patients. Therefore, the lack of effect of withholding antibiotics could have been related to their relative inefficacy in the first place. In this study, short-term goals as well as biologic goals of bacterial eradication and inflammation reduction as discussed above were also not recorded.",
