Each spherical viral particle is approximately 70 nm in diameter and is comprised of a strand of genomic RNA, encapsidated by capsid (C) proteins, surrounded by a host cell\u2013derived lipid bilayer spiked with heterodimers of envelope proteins E1 and E2.4 The other two structural proteins, 6K and E3, are leader peptides for E1 and E2, respectively, and are not observed in abundance in the mature virion.4\n",

However, certain aspects of this outbreak distinguished it from previous reports of dengue fever outbreaks. Most striking was the severity of the arthralgia that \u201cwould prevent the sufferer from changing position without help.\u201d8 The local population began to call the disease chikungunya, which is a Makonde (Bantu) term that means \u201cthat which bends up,\u201d referring to the contorted positions of those who were affected by the sudden and severe onset of arthralgia. Additionally, many individuals affected with the disease continued to experience intermittent joint pains that persisted for months after the acute illness. The attack rate also seemed to be unusually high, often affecting entire households. Between 1952 and 1953, an estimated 60% to 80% of the population in this region developed symptoms of fever, rash, and arthralgia.8 Attempts to isolate the pathologic agent from symptomatic individuals during the outbreak also diverged from previous experience with dengue virus (DENV): Inoculation of infant mice with serum samples from symptomatic individuals resulted in death of the animals. In contrast, DENV infection is difficult to establish in mice.9 These data suggested that the cause of the syndrome termed chikungunya indeed was distinct from the cause of dengue fever.",

The outbreaks occurred after periods of large rainfall and associated surges in the arboreal Aedes mosquito density. In contrast, CHIKV outbreaks in Southeast Asia occurred in larger cities where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were implicated as the primary transmission vector. A aegypti mosquitoes require very small amounts of water to lay eggs, and thrive in human urban environments, particularly in areas where residents store water in open containers or cisterns.",

He concluded that \u201cthe diseases, though somewhat alike in a few symptoms, are essentially different.\u201d20 Thus, although the 2013 epidemic was the first CHIKV outbreak in the Americas to be confirmed using modern-day virologic methods, historical reports raise questions to whether this truly was the first introduction of CHIKV infection to the Americas.21\n",

Development of nonhuman primate models of CHIKV infection has been helpful for use in evaluating potential CHIKV vaccines. Rhesus macaques immunized with an investigational CHIKV virus-like particle vaccine were protected against developing viremia after intravenous challenge with 1010 PFU of CHIKV, whereas control monkeys that received the mock vaccine developed high levels of viremia after challenge.29 In a separate study, cynomolgus macaques challenged with a much lower CHIKV inoculum, by either intravenous or intradermal injection, developed viremia, fever, and rash. Viral RNA remained detectable in synovial and muscle tissue for up to 1.5 months after infection, and in lymphoid tissue for up to 3 months.30 Thus, this model may be useful for studying long-term sequelae of CHIKV infection, such as the prolonged arthralgia experienced by many CHIKV individuals.",

Sudden onset of high fever is typically the initial symptom reported and can appear within 2 days of infection. A rash sometimes is observed and is typically maculopapular, although bullous rashes have been noted in some infants with CHIKV infection.33 Both viral infections also are known to cause arthralgia and arthritis. However, the polyarthralgia caused by CHIKV frequently is characterized as debilitating and has been reported to continue well beyond the resolution of fever. For example, a third of travelers to the Caribbean who acquired CHIKV infection in 2014 while abroad reported persistent joint or muscle pain, or joint swelling at greater than or equal to 9 months after their acute infection.34 The knees are the most commonly involved joints; however, other large or small joints may be affected. Of note, symmetric involvement of joints is frequently reported.35 Additional symptoms reported include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and conjunctivitis. Conspicuously absent among those with CHIKV infection are reports of retro-orbital headache, which are characteristic of dengue fever.8 Most symptoms resolve within 7 to 10 days; however, many infected individuals have reported protracted arthralgia that has lasted weeks, months, or even years. This long-term burden of disease can be devastating to local economies and represents a significant health cost: CHIKV was responsible for 1386 to 1,081,962 nondiscounted years of life lost in 2005.36 These values are now significant underestimations of the true health cost burden, given its expanding distribution to the Americas since those estimates were made.",

For diagnostic confirmation of current and recent infection, a molecular test (typically polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) for the virus and an assay for the presence of specific IgM antibody are required. The most frequently needed assay is the CHIKV IgM antibody assay. Molecular testing for the presence of the virus is required in the early stages of disease. Virus is present in the blood at the time symptoms appear and PCR testing provides reliable detection for 5 days thereafter (6 days total). During that time only a molecular test for the virus should be ordered. As IgM production rises, by Days 7 to 9, viremia falls to PCR undetectable levels. During Days 5 to 9 when the viral load is waning and IgM has not reached its peak, it is necessary to order a molecular test for the virus and the IgM antibody assay to maintain good diagnostic sensitivity. After that, only the IgM test is required. After 14 to 21 days both the IgM and IgG test are positive, and the IgM test wanes over several weeks or months, whereas IgG remains for years as a good marker of past infection and immunologic protection, and also as an epidemiologic tool to determine seroprevalence in a population.",

For example, chloroquine has in vitro activity against several viruses, and has been found to inhibit CHIKV replication in Vero cells.54 However, it has not been shown to have anti-CHIKV effects in vivo. Compounds that may interfere with viral entry, including phenothiazines55 and flavaglines,56 are being investigated as potential therapies.
