            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) with high mortality remains a common disease in intensive care unit (ICU). Generally speaking, infection is the primary cause, which induces excessive cytokines from inflammatory cells and enhances inflammatory response. Factors predicting the onset, severity or outcome of this disease are not well known. Experimental evidence suggests that activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), especial angiotensin (AT) may influence the pathogenesis of ALI via affecting inflammation including producing inflammatory factors and apoptosis.1 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme that converts AT-I to AT-II. The human ACE gene is located on chromosome 17q23, while its polymorphism is consists of the presence (insertion, I) and absence (deletion, D) of a 287-bp Alu repeat sequence in intron 16.2 ACE I/D polymorphism has been shown to influence the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome,2 and is different with various races and districts.3 There was no report of ACE genotypes in the Han Chinese with ALI in the district.",

Though cases in the study were not sufficient, the proportions of the ACE genotypes were similar to those previously reported in Chinese ethnic groups. However, due to a relatively small proportion of people carrying the DD genotype in the general population among Asian people, more cases may be required.",

LPS is an effective activator which may increase ACE mRNA expression and ACE activity in all genotypes. Among the three genotypes, PBMC of DD genotype has the highest level after exposure to LPS. It may be the pathway triggered due to ACE polymorphism. It is well known that the renin-angiotensin system play an important role in inflammation. AT has a pro-inflammatory effect for the development or aggravation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. ACE I/D polymorphism had been shown to be associated with injury to lung tissue in severe acute respiratory syndrome.15 Moreover, ACE plays a major role in the host defense against invading pathogens.16 It is therefore that polymorphisms in the ACE gene may have an important effect on determining the development and the outcome of ALI.",
