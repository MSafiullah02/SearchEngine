Adams described an outbreak of nosocomial chest infections in 32 infants in a neonatal unit that resulted in 9 deaths, with cytoplasmic inclusions identifi ed in the lungs at autopsy. RSV was fi rst identifi ed in 1956 from a colony of chimpanzees with coryza and designated \"chimpanzee coryzal agent\". Subsequently a year later in 1957 it was isolated from children with lung disease in Baltimore, USA [ 5 ] . Since then RSV has been recognized as the single most important virus causing acute respiratory tract infections in infants and young children throughout the world [ 1 , 6 , 7 ] . Although primarily a respiratory pathogen of infants and young children, RSV infects and re-infects adults, and causes signifi cant disease in the elderly and in those patients with chronic lung disease or immunocompromise [ 6 ] .",

RSV is a pleomorphic (spherical or fi lamentous form) enveloped RNA virus 120-300 nm in size that contains a non-segmented single-strand negative-sense RNA genome. Two large surface glycoproteins, fusion protein (F) and attachment protein (G), are the major antigenic determinants and induce antibody production. There are two major groups of RSV strains, A and B, that are distinguished by antigenic characteristics, mainly in variations in the G (attachment) protein, as there are few differences in the F (fusion) protein between the strains [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] .",

During expiration this enhances dynamic small/distal airways narrowing, producing disproportionate turbulence and decreased airfl ow causing airtrapping. Further air-trapping can be caused by a ball-valve mechanism of airway obstruction due to intraluminal plugging by mucus and cellular debris. Clinically the infl ammatory process in the small/distal airways (i.e. bronchiolitis) can result in both pulmonary hyperinfl ation and areas of atelectasis, along with wheezing due to small/distal airways obstruction.",

Inherent variations in the infected individual's infl ammatory and apoptotic response also infl uence the degree of submucosal edema, increased mucus secretion, and sloughing of epithelial cells. The former factors probably account for the high incidence of respiratory disease in younger smaller individuals with their smaller distal airways (e.g. premature infants) [ 3 , 10 ] .

Local secretory IgA is the prominent humoral mediator of resistance in the upper respiratory tract, whereas serum IgG provides additional protection in the lower respiratory tract. The F and G surface glycoproteins are the only RSV proteins to induce protective neutralizing antibodies (mainly of the IgG1 subclass) in children [ 6 ] . In neonates and infants, high levels of maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies confer some protection [ 6 , 7 ] . Cellular immunity plays the predominant role in combating and recovering from RSV infection, with T-lymphocytic stimulation and response playing an integral function. The antiviral and cell-mediated immune reaction to RSV infection is primarily orchestrated by RSV-infected respiratory epithelial cells and by alveolar macrophages. T helper 1-type cytokines -interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), interleukin type 2 (IL-2), IL-12; T helper 2-type cytokines -IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10; antiviral interferons -IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2; and chemokines -C, CC, CXC and CX 3 C subgroups, attract and activate leukocytes, especially alveolar macrophages, to the RSV-infected respiratory tract.

Therefore the immunopathogenesis of RSV disease in the great majority of children who develop mild respiratory symptoms, and may not see a doctor or attend hospital, is largely inferred [ 8 , 11 , 12 ] . A misdirected immune cascade, characterised by an overexuberant release of infl ammatory mediators (\"cytokine storm\") and infi ltration of a range of monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells may predispose to more severe bronchiolitis, which is further manipulated by host genetic and acquired factors. Contrary to prevailing infl ammatory avalanche theories, a study in Chilean children (where mechanical ventilation was not available) dying from RSV or infl uenza bronchiolitis and North American infants surviving RSV or infl uenza bronchiolitis found a blunted adaptive cell-mediated immune response with a relative absence of cytotoxic T-cells [ 10 ] .

During their fi rst RSV infection, between 25 % and 40 % of infants have bronchiolitic (or pneumonic) signs and symptoms, and up to 3 % require hospitalization (in developed/resource-rich nations) [ 1 , 15 ] . In the USA, RSV bronchiolitis accounts for up to 90,000 hospitalizations annually, 20,000 in the UK, and 3,000 in the Netherlands [ 1 , 15 ] . Generally the reported hospital admission rates for children under 1 year of age in the USA and Europe is around 25-30 per 1,000 infants [ 3 ] . Incidence and hospitalization rates for bronchiolitis in resource-limited areas are lacking owing to the paucity of epidemiological studies and cost-saving restrictions in laboratory confi rmation of viral infection [ 4 , 7 , 16 ] . Both A and B strains circulate concurrently within a RSV season. There are distinct genotypes within the strains which vary in dominance within a community from year to year [ 17 ] . This may account for the frequency of re-infection as any immunity to previous genotypes is evaded [ 17 ] . Approximately 3-10 % of infants hospitalized with RSV infection (and about 1 % of all those with bronchiolitis) develop respiratory failure and require admission to PICU [ 2 , 3 ] . Amongst the children from resource-rich countries admitted to PICU with bronchiolitis, the reported incidence of those requiring mechanical or noninvasive ventilation varies from 50 % to 100 % depending more on the country, than the region or unit [ 2 , 18 , 19 ] .",

Some authors have discriminated restrictive from obstructive RSV lung disease on pulmonary function tests (decrease respiratory compliance) [ 28 ] or ventilatory indices (oxygen index, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, mean airways pressure) [ 29 ] , in addition to four-quadrant alveolar consolidation on chest radiograph in mechanically ventilated children. In everyday pediatric practice clinicians cannot strictly dichotomise this heterogeneous lung disease into restrictive and obstructive forms, especially when each potentially occurs within different parts of the same lung [ 16 , 27 ] . In the USA and some European countries \"RSV bronchiolitis\" and \"RSV pneumonia\" are differentiated clinically by the presence of localized crackles and consolidation on chest radiograph [ 3 ] .

The viral load and/or uncontrolled viral replication may well infl uence disease severity. Higher viral loads in tracheal aspirates of ventilated infants with \"severe RSV LRTI\" compared to \"mild disease\" (differentiated on mean airways pressure and oxygenation indices) have been found [ 37 ] . A higher nasal viral load in ventilated compared to nonventilated bronchiolitic children was demonstrated in an initial study, however, a subsequent larger study (from the same research team) failed to fi nd a signifi cant difference [ 38 ] . Viral load and/or uncontrolled viral replication being a factor is supported by the fi nding of excessive viral antigen and overwhelming apoptotic sloughing of infected respiratory epithelial cells in the fatal cases of Chilean children dying from RSV (especially) or infl uenza bronchiolitis [ 10 ] . However, viral strain and viral load alone cannot fully account for variations in disease severity, so it remains likely that variations in pre-existing structural elements of the distal respiratory tree and the inherent immune response also play key roles [ 10 , 14 ] .",

However, strong convincing evidence of RSV-related infl ammation or infection at these sites is less forthcoming. Elevated cardiac troponin levels in infants with severe RSV infection are well described. Unfortunately this is not necessarily indicative of RSV-directed myocardial injury, but more likely the result of (right) heart strain secondary to severe lung parenchymal disease [ 40 , 41 ] . Likewise, it is highly suggestive that raised hepatic transaminases in this patient group are consequential to hepatic congestion or ischemia due to right heart failure, itself secondary to parenchymal lung disease and/or pulmonary hypertension [ 41 , 42 ] . Proof of a RSV hepatitis would take histological verifi cation (i.e. liver biopsy), which for ethical reasons is only ever going to occur postmortem. Apneas and seizures undoubtedly occur in RSV infection, but presently there is more support for RSV encephalopathy than RSV encephalitis [ 39 ] . The reported frequency of bronchiolitis-induced apnea varies from 1 % to 24 % of those children admitted to hospital, and up to 20 % of those admitted to PICU [ 43 , 44 ] . Unfortunately many of the reports fail to adequately adjust for the confounding consequence that hypoxic episodes and hypercapnea may have on the patient's neurological status. When not related to hypoxic or electrolyte imbalance triggers, RSV's central infl uence/effect is probably related to released neurotoxic infl ammatory chemokines and cytokines [ 12 , 13 ] . Endocrine impact/consequences appear to be the sequelae of severe RSV pulmonary disease and/or its treatment. It is likely that occurrences of hyponatremia and hyponatremic seizures are largely related to the use of hypotonic/electrolyte-poor intravenous solutions [ 39 ] . Further research is required to scrutinize whether the reported neuroendocrine stress response in RSV bronchiolitis is no more than an epiphenomenon refl ecting severity of RSV disease. Extrapulmonary effects are not uncommon and are more likely to be the end result of release of infl ammatory mediators than direct effects.",

However, none of the studies included mechanically ventilated children [ 58 ] .",

The application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) keeps the airways open and thereby facilitates expiratory fl ow, improves compliance, reduces work of breathing and enhances gas exchange. There is supportive evidence that delivery of CPAP via a mask or nasal prongs may reverse impending respiratory failure and avoid intubation [ 68 -70 ] . On this front, humidifi ed high-fl ow nasal oxygen is demonstrating great promise in providing effective respiratory support -preventing progression of respiratory failure to needing mechanical ventilation and shortening admissions [ 71 ] . Intubation and mechanical ventilation (positive pressure ventilatory support) is the mainstay of supportive therapy for children with viral bronchiolitis-induced respiratory failure due to worsening lung compliance, imminent respiratory collapse secondary to exhaustion, or apnoea and respiratory arrest. Already in the 1980s, retrospective studies confi rmed the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation in bronchiolitisassociated respiratory failure [ 72 ] . Unfortunately there are no randomized controlled trials on the level of positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) or ventilatory strategies (for example, volume-controlled versus pressure controlled, or high frequency versus conventional ventilation) for ventilated children with bronchiolitis-induced respiratory failure [ 18 ] . Perhaps this is because bronchiolitis is a heterogeneous lung disease with varying obstructive and restrictive elements, rather than a homogenous clinical entity [ 18 , 27 ] . When maximum conventional mechanical ventilation or high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) fail to stabilize or reverse deteriorating oxygenation (and ventilation), extracorporeal life support (ECLS)/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the last port of call for these refractory cases. Survival rates of ECLS/ECMO for RSV bronchiolitis are better than other indications for ECLS/ECMO and range from 71 % [ 73 ] to as high as 96 % [ 74 ] , with a low reported rate of neurological sequelae [ 75 ] .",

Even though it produced high serum antibody levels it resulted in worse bronchiolitis following RSV infection in the vaccinated group than the control nonvaccinated children [ 3 , 6 , 15 ] . Development of an effective RSV vaccine is being actively explored and is a high research priority [ 3 , 6 ] . A RSV vaccine needs to offer better protection than that from natural infection and be effective in the fi rst weeks of life when maternally-acquired anti-RSV antibodies are still present. Live attenuated vaccines have the potential advantages of being delivered intranasally and inducing both a local mucosal and a systemic immune response. However, they tend to be unstable, too virulent and revert back to wild-type virus [ 3 , 6 , 15 ] . Vaccines produced from purifi ed viruses, recombinant vectors, and plasmids containing complementary DNA of the viral genome that generally target the F (fusion) and G (attachment) transmembrane glycoproteins are being trialled [ 3 , 6 , 32 ] .",
