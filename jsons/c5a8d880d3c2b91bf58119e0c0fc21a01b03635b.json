Depending on the underlying cause, the morphological picture of acute necrotizing hepatitis may develop, with extensive confluent cellular destruction. The extent of necrosis, measured by the morphologically evidenced hepatic volume fraction of the still functioning liver parenchyma, yields reliable information on the chance of survival (J. Scotto et al., 1973) . Given a normal value of 85% hepatic volume fraction (HVF) of intact liver cells for each volume unit of the total liver, a decrease to < 30% (threshold 28\u03ea35%) would possibly mean that the patient is unlikely to survive. (2 ( ( .) In acute liver failure caused by toxins or hypoxia, massive fatty degeneration of the hepatocytes can vary substantially. In diffuse fatty degeneration featuring minute vacuoles and damage to the organelles, liver cell necrosis cannot, as a rule, be detected (e. g. acute fatty liver during pregnancy, Reye's syndrome, in association with tetracycline or valproic acid). (3.) Between these two \"classical\" morphological manifestations, there are also compound forms, i. e. 381 courses of disease with a variety of histological changes of different intensities and combinations. On occasions, it is also possible to identify histological findings which point to a certain cause of the disease. (41, 59) From a morphological point of view, acute liver failure is potentially reversible, so that even complete regeneration can be attained. Precursory cellular necrosis is hence less of a determinant than the capacity to regenerate.",

Intracranial cerebral compression is > 20 mm Hg. Cerebral oedema is vasogenetic and/or cytotoxic, the latter feature appearing to predominate. Clinical symptoms include disorders in the respiratory rhythm (in particular tachypnoea), hypertension, bradycardia and increased muscular tonus. Singultus implies damage to and impending constriction of the brain stem. The pupils are dilated due to the pressure on the oculomotor nerve. Chemosis can develop, which is a fatal prognostic sign.

(51, 54) (s. pp 285, 288, 310) Essential phospholipids (EPL): In a pilot study, it was possible to achieve recompensation and lasting stabilization in nine out of ten patients suffering from severe liver insufficiency by i.v. administration of a new galenic form of polyenylphosphatidylcholine. (32) \u2022 This clinical result accords with other clinical studies and might be supported by the finding that a considerable deterioration in liver function was associated with a deficit of EPL.

As medicinal treatment, i.v. administration of the glutathione precursor Nacetylcysteine is the therapy of choice (L. F. Prescott et al., 1977) . Dosage is 150 mg/kg BW with glucose as a rapid i.v. infusion (15\u03ea20 minutes), followed by 50 mg/ kg BW over 4 hours and finally 100 mg/kg BW during the next 16 hours (\u03ed about 300 mg/kg BW within 20 hours). This therapy has to be commenced as soon as possible (no later than 12\u03ea15 hours after intoxication), even though a hepatoprotective effect can still be achieved up to 36 hours later. A serum concentration of < 200 \u03bcg/ml within 4 hours or < 60 \u03bcg/ml within 12 hours after intake can be considered prognostically favourable.

If renal function is sufficient, this course of therapy can be repeated every one to four hours, as required. Serum osmolality should not exceed 320 mosm/l, and intracranial pressure should not go above 20 mmHg. When renal function is restricted, dehydration must be effected by haemofiltration. Artificial respiration is required (often as PEEP ventilation). Continuous monitoring of the intracranial pressure using an epidural intracerebral pressure probe is extremely helpful. Frequently, there is increased susceptibility to cerebral convulsibility; therefore, phenytoin should be administered at an early stage. Therapeutic application of thiopental (A. Forbes et al., 1989) as i.v. solution (up to 150 mg/hour) calls for intracranial pressure probe monitoring. (22) Other means of lowering the intracerebral pressure include the use of aminophylline, ranitidine, luxus oxygenation and semirecumbent positioning. (8, 17, 34, 65) A prophylactic reduction in pCO 2 down to 25\u03ea35 mm Hg through hyperventilation can be advantageous in the initial stage of a brain oedema.

It is dialyzed against a bicarbonate solution in order to remove the excess water and water-soluble substances (ammonia, creatinine, urea, iron, copper) as well as to stabilize the electrolyte and glucose levels and the pH value. The results obtained to date are promising. (95, 103, 106) FPSA: Fractioned plasma separation and adsorption is a very efficient and multifactorial method, employing 390 membranes and adsorbants. (88) It is additionally characterized by the use of microparticles (2.0\u03ea3.5 \u03bcm), which are recirculated in suspension using high-speed flow (2\u03ea4 l/min) to optimize the in-line filtration process. In a further development, a special sulfone filter is applied.",

Heterotopic transplantation involves placing an auxilliary (additional) organ in the right upper abdomen (O. T. Terpstra et al., 1988). In surgical terms, this technique is considered to be demanding due to the application of the piggy-back method (\u03ed anastomosis of the donor liver with the appropriately prepared ostium of the hepatic veins to the infrahepatic caval vein, generally cranial to the opening of the renal vein). \u2022 These two methods (APOLT and auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation) are particularly suitable for juveniles with acute liver failure because they bridge the critical time span preceding the regeneration of the diseased liver. Immunosuppression is thus only required for a restricted period of time. The transplant shrinks or is surgically removed. Acute liver failure induced by Ecstasy was successfully overcome using this technique. (116) It allows the liver function to be compensated and gives the diseased liver time to regenerate. (120) ",

However, based on the results of subsequent studies, this procedure can no longer be recommended.2. Haemoperfusion:The removal of both water-soluble and protein-bound substances from the plasma was first attempted by means of a haemoperfusion circuit, using a column filled with activated charcoal(D. C. Schechter et al., 1958). Both the unwanted binding of corpuscular components and the danger of embolization from charcoal particles could largely be eliminated by coating the activated charcoal with a biocompatible membrane, i.e. microencapsulation (T. M. S. Chang et al., 1964). Because of the greater aggregation of thrombocytes, however, thrombopenia often ensues. This event can generally be prevented by the administration of prostacyclin (C. A. E. Gimson et al., 1980). Unfortunately, however, this procedure causes a loss of insulin and other hormones. (90) 3. Cross-circulation: Homologous cross-circulation with healthy volunteers was first attempted by J. M. Burnell et al. in 1965. \u2022 Due to multiple problems, S. C. W. Bosman et al. introduced heterologous cross-circulation using a baboon in 1968; baboons are the only animal species which can tolerate human blood for five to seven days. 4. Plasmapheresis: This procedure is a further development of blood exchange (M. J. Lepore et al., 1967).The patient's plasma is separated by centrifugation or other appropriate techniques and discarded, so that the protein-bound and fat-soluble toxins circulating in the plasma are removed. This plasma volume is replaced by fresh plasma. At the same time, the separated corpuscular components of the patient's blood are reinfused. Serious complications may arise from the transmission of viral hepatitis and the occurrence of transfusion-related lung disorders (ARDS). Nevertheless, the method involved is simple and has been carried out successfully in individual cases(89,93,104) even as plasma exchange with the administration of a high plasma volume (1.3 l/hr over 8 hours).",

The crucial factor, however, remains the choice of the appropriate time for carrying out the transplantation: (1.) the possibility of eliminating decompensation by means of regeneration should be exploited; (2 ( ( .) delayed indications should not result in complications which would prevent a transplantation from being carried out (e. g. brain-stem herniation, sepsis). (see chapter 40.7)5.4.1 Orthotopic transplantation\u1b64 The survival rate following orthotopic transplantation in acute liver failure is 50 to 80% after one year and about 60% after five years. When the indication for transplantation is given, it is impossible to foresee to what extent the patient's life might be lengthened. The decision as to whether and when a transplantation is indicated continues to be arbitrary. The question of which patients will benefit most from transplantation is still unresolved \u03ea particularly since liver diseases are, in general, potentially reversible. However, acute liver failure due to Wilson's disease or the Budd-Chiari syndrome is an indication for liver transplantation, because these conditions are always lethal otherwise. Of all liver transplantations in Europe, a constant 10\u03ea12% are carried out due to ALF. In patients under the age of 45, this figure is 20%. Meanwhile, OLT has already been carried out on four adolescents for Ecstasy-induced liver failure. \u2022 With an isoelectric line in the electroencephalograph and with irreversible cerebral oedema, transplantation is no longer possible.
