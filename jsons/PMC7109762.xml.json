[2] in early 2004. As I pointed out clearly, Esper et al. [3] were unaware of van der Hoek et al.\u2019s discovery of the Netherlands strain of human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) when they designed their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and apparently also when they first found the HCoV they designated the \u201cNew Haven coronavirus\u201d (HCoV-NH). I described the methodology used by Esper et al. for finding the virus as \u201clogical, intelligent, and highly original\u201d (p. 489)\u2014as was, in fact, the different methodology used by van der Hoek et al.\u2014and the development of this methodology seemed to me at least as notable an accomplishment as the discovery of a \u201cnew\u201d virus. In my Editorial Commentary, I also stated that HCoV-NH appeared to be similar to, and quite possibly (although not certainly) the same as, HCoV-NL63. The published sequence of HCoV-NH, which covered only a portion of a single gene from this very large genome, did not seem to be adequate to make a final decision on this point, however",

In addition, broader application of their PCR methodology offers to us the hope that we will find additional members of this family of viruses",
