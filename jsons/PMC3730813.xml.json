            "text": "The innate immunity provides a primary host response to microbial invasion, which induces an inflammatory nidus to localize the infection and prevent systemic dissemination of pathogens. The key process in this is the recognition of microbial agents by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). The PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), RNA helicases (RIG-I (retinoid acid-inducible gene-I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), and LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology gene 2)), C-type lectin receptors, and cytosolic DNA sensors (DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors, absent in melanoma-2, interferon inducible protein 16 (leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1), RNA polymerase III, DExD/H box RNA helicases, and IFI16), which sense evolutionarily conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of microorganisms.1 By detecting PAMPs, PRRs trigger sequential activation of intracellular signaling pathways leading to induction of a range of cytokines and chemokines that orchestrate the early host resistance to infection. Specifically, activation of NLRs results in the formation of a molecular scaffold complex (an inflammasome) that leads to the active release of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 through caspase-1 activation (Figure 1). These PRRs signaling also facilitate the differentiation of T cells and B cells to establish antigen-specific adaptive immunity.2, 3, 4",

Antigen-presenting cells in the lamina propria also appear to be unresponsive to TLR ligands.7 Other TLRs are normally expressed in endosomes (TLR3, TLR7 to TLR9) or basolateral membrane (TLR5), where these TLRs are not exposed to pathogens unless pathogens get into the cells or invade mucosa. NOD and NLRs are also expressed in the cytoplasm and thus do not recognize extracellular pathogens unless pathogens inject the cells\u2019 effector proteins (Table 1). On the other hand, constitutive activation of selected TLR signaling in IECs may be required for epithelial homeostasis. IEC-specific deletion of the downstream molecules of TLR signaling such as myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated kinase 1, and nuclear factor-\u03baB essential modulator in mice results in spontaneous intestinal inflammation.8, 9, 10 TLR9 can be expressed on the apical or the basolateral sides of IECs, in which ligand recognition activates a tolerogenic or inflammatory responses, respectively.11 In addition to IECs, many TLRs are expressed and have unique roles in Paneth cells, goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells in the intestine.12, 13, 14 These findings highlight a unique feature of PRRs in IECs that establishes selective responses and tolerance to the commensal flora at the mucosal interface.",

            "text": "Dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been implicated as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).31 Given the importance of mucosal PRR signaling in the maintenance of commensal flora in the normal intestine, PRR deficiency may alter the composition of commensal flora that may be involved in the pathogenesis of colitis. The colitic TLR5\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased intestinal bacterial burden and variability of commensal flora compared with non-colitic TLR5\u2212/\u2212 mice.25 An increase of the Enterobacteriaceae composition has been shown during chemically induced colitis in mice, which correlates with the severity of intestinal inflammation.32 The extent of this shift in commensal composition during colitis is less in TLR2/TLR4 double-deficinet mice than WT mice.32 In addition, the TLR2/TLR4 double-deficient mice have significantly less burdens of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Enterococcous species in the intestine compared with WT mice.32 However, the alteration of composition of commensal flora in TLR-deficient mice is limited at baseline and mostly dependent on maternal transmission rather than TLR regulation of host\u2013commensal interactions.33 IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mouse is a well-established model of colitis as they develop spontaneous colitis due to uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to commensal flora.34 In fact, different types of commensal bacteria cause intestinal inflammation with different onset, location, and degree in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice.35 Interestingly, nullifying MyD88 in IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice results in the prevention of colitis induction.36 There are conflicting reports regarding inhibition or acceleration of colitis in TLR4/IL-10 double-knockout mice, which may be explained by differences in flora across various facilities.37, 38, 39 Cross breeding IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice with TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice have shown exacerbation of colitis, but crossing IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice with TLR9\u2212/\u2212 mice did not alter intestinal phenotype of IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice despite both TLR2 and TLR9 signal through MyD88.37, 40 Nullifying MyD88 in other commensal-dependent spontaneous colitis models, such as IL-2\u2212/\u2212 mice or Tbx21\u2212/\u2212Rag\u2212/\u2212 mice both show similar severity of colitis as their MyD88-sufficient counterparts.36, 41, 42 Interestingly, treatment of TLR4/TLR5 double-knockout mice with IL-10 receptor neutralizing antibody (IL-10R mAb) results in development of colitis but IL-1R-deficient TLR5\u2212/\u2212 mice does not show signs of colitis in response to IL-10R mAb treatment.43 Because IL-1R shares MyD88 signaling with other TLRs, these results indicate that IL-1 and MyD88 signaling may have a role for induction of colitis seen in TLR5\u2212/\u2212 mice, although in another study IL-1R\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed worse colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS).44 These conflicting results suggest that the role of MyD88 in comensal dependent colitis may differ depending on its upstream inputs and cytokine profile.",

            "text": "Demand for PRR signaling becomes higher in the setting of epithelial damage than homeostatic conditions in the gut. Regardless of the cause, disruption of the epithelial barrier integrity leads to exposure of mucosal immune system to the mass of commensals. During epithelial damage, PRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns that are released from host tissues.45, 46 Mouse DSS-induced colitis is a well-established colitis model specifically relevant to investigate intestinal innate immune responses to epithelial injury as this model is induced by chemical damage of the epithelium and does not require adaptive immunity.47 In the DSS-induced colitis, it has been shown that germ-free mice demonstrate worse colitis compared with conventional mice, but similar severity of colitis has been noted between conventional mice and the commensal-depleted mice that are orally supplemented with TLR2 and TLR4 ligands.48, 49 Consistently, TLR2\u2212/\u2212 and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased severity of DSS-induced colitis.49, 50 MyD88, but not TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF)-deficient, mice also demonstrated more severe disease than WT mice in this model, suggesting the importance of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling in protection against mucosal damage.50, 51 However, the underlying mechanisms of protection differ between TLR2 and TLR4. TLR2 signaling in IECs induces tight junctional protein ZO-1 through activation of protein kinase C, which strengthen epithelial barrier integrity and resists cell apoptosis.52, 53 TLR2 signaling also induces cytoprotective trefoil factor production.54 By contrast, TLR4-mediated MyD88 signaling in IECs and subepithelial macrophages induces cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) that amplifies mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, supporting epithelial survival.55, 56, 57, 58 TLR4 signaling in IECs also induces expression and release of amphyregulin and epiregulin that activate epidermal growth factor receptor.59 Therefore, multiple cytoprotective functions in IECs are covered by several TLRs signaling, but defects in different aspects of the cytoprotection may result in similar manifestations in the intestine.",

            "text": "Intestinal inflammation in NLR-deficient mice has been extensively studied (Table 2). The most striking phenotype was observed in NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice.27 Mice deficient in NLRP6 and its signaling adapter apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) show increased number of CD45+ cells in lamina propria, crypt hyperplasia in the colon and enlargement of Peyer\u2019s patches with formation of germinal centers.27 These mice have increased mucosal permeability during DSS colitis and are unable to recover from colitis.61, 62 Bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrate that NLRP6 deficiency in non-hematopoietic cells is responsible for the increased susceptibility to DSS colitis.27 Among bone marrow chimera mice developed by WT mice and NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice, mucosal IL-18 production in response to DSS treatment is significantly reduced only when NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice are used as recipient.27 Similar increase in DSS susceptibility is observed when WT bone marow is transferred to IL-18\u2212/\u2212 mice but not IL-1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice, indicating that NLRP6-mediated IL-18 production from intestinal non-hematopoietic cells contributes to the resistance against DSS-induced colitis.27 As the expression of NLRP6 in IECs is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 which is known to be induced by TLR4 signaling and has potent anti-inflammatory properties, NLRP6-mediated mucosal protection against DSS-induced injury involves epithelial response to commensal bacteria through TLR4 signaling.63, 64, 65 Furthermore, NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice have significantly elevated expression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) chemokine in the colon compared with WT mice, suggesting that NLRP6 has an important role for the negative regulation of CCL5 to maintain intestinal host\u2013commensal homeostasis.27 Interestingly, the susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and upregulation of CCL5 in NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice is associated with alterations of commensal composition (especially high prevalence of genus Prevotellaceae and group TM7 bacteria).27 Co-housing with NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice and hence adopting similar flora, WT mice experienced upregulation of CCL5 in the colon. Although this upregulation of intestinal CCL5 did not cause spontaneous intestinal inflammation in WT mice, these mice had worse colitis in response to DSS than WT mice that are housed by themselves. Increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis by co-housing with NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice was not observed in CCL5\u2212/\u2212 mice confirming CCL5 as an effector molecule in exacerbation of colitis by the commensal alteration. Although IL-18\u2212/\u2212 mice have elevated CCL5 levels in the intestine, IL-18\u2212/\u2212 mice carry distinct commensal bacteria from that in NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice.27 Commensal bacteria-dependent increase of colitis susceptibility has also been observed in Tbx21\u2212/\u2212Rag\u2212/\u2212-deficient mice and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-deficient mice.66, 67 Therefore, IL-18-dependent and -independent mechanisms or multiple types of commensal bacteria may be involved in the intestinal phenotype of NLRP6\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

In addition, NOD1\u2212/\u2212 mice and Nod1/Nod2 double-knockout mice have been reported to be more susceptible to DSS-induced colitis compared with control mice partly due to increased mucosal permiability during colitis.72, 73 NOD2 has shown to regulate intestinal commensal flora through the secretion of bacteria-killing factors.69 Therefore, impaired NOD2 signaling alters commensal composition and increases the susceptibility to intestinal inflammation that may be associated with defective secretion of antimicrobial peptides in the intestine and abnormal immune cell response to the altered commensal flora. The increased mucosal permeability may facilitate mucosal immune cell exposure to luminal contents.",

Commensal bacteria through TLR signaling may individually activate NLR inflammasomes by inducing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lysosomal leakage, and production of reactive oxygen species.89, 90, 91 Recently, we have described that oxidized mitochondrial DNA induced by the above stimuli binds to NLRP3 and induces inflammasome activation during cell apoptosis, but this is inhibited by autophagy activation.92 Therefore, host\u2013microbial interactions in intestinal mucosal interface are orchestrated by TLRs and NLRs through regulation of the balance between autophagy and inflammasome activation.",

Extensive studies have identified the molecular pathogenesis of sporadic colon cancer based on genetic alterations. Although the process of developing colitis-associated cancer involves some of these genetic abnormalities, unique aspects of colon carcinogenesis in the setting of chronic colitis have been illuminated.93, 94 As inflamed intestinal cells in patients with IBD have these genetic alterations before developing histological features of dysplasia, genetic alterations in colitis-associated cancer may be a secondary step rather than primary cause of tumorigenesis.95 It is likely that abnormal signaling in some PRRs leads to uncontrolled expression of the genes and enzymes regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair before the gene alterations. Although precise mechanisms underlying initiation and/or promotion of the inflammation-associated intestinal cancer have yet to be fully determined, frequent cycles of injury and repair of the epithelium in the presence of tumorigenic cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins may predispose to genetic mutations, which increases neoplastic risk.96, 97 As conventionalization of germ-free animals accelerates epithelial proliferation in the intestine, PRR signaling may have an important role in regulation of epithelial proliferation.98 It has been reported that TLR-mediated MyD88 signaling in subepithelial macrophages regulates crypt stem cell differentiation and epithelial proliferation through expression of COX-2 and PGE2.57, 58 TLR4 stimulation has also been shown to induce proliferation of human IECs via induction of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands.99, 100 The inflammatory milieu may enhance surface expression of TLR2 and TLR4, leading to IECs responsiveness to their ligands.101, 102 These results suggest that abnormal TLR signaling, especially TLR2 and TLR4 in both IECs and subepithelial macrophages, may induce aberrant epithelial proliferation and thus may contribute to cancer development in the setting of chronic inflammation.",

The AOM-DSS (a single injection of azoxymethane followed by repeated DSS treatment and recovery) model mimics human colitis-associated cancer as it represents repeated mucosal injury and repair, leading to epithelial proliferation and dysplastic transformation in the colon.103 In this model, TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice are protected from tumor development due to decreased expression of mucosal COX-2, PGE2, and amphiregulin.59 Supplementation of PGE2 during the recovery of colitis bypasses the protective phenotype of TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice against intestinal tumors along with sustained upregulation of COX-2 in subepithelial macrophages and epithelial amphiregulin production.56 Therefore, the upregulation of PGE2 during the recovery phase of colitis is a key for colitis-associated tumorigenesis involved in TLR4 signaling. TLR4 expression only in stroma but not in myeloid cells restored tumor incidence in TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice.104 In addition, transgenic expression of constitutively active TLR4 results in increased mucosal PGE2 production and tumor development in this model.28 These results indicate that epithelial TLR4 signaling contribute to tumor development through mucosal production of PGE2 in the setting of chronic colitis.",

Mucosal TNF-\u03b1 signaling and IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation are known to be indispensable during tumor development in this model.106 In addition, STAT3-mediated T helper type 17 cell generation has been shown to facilitate tumor development in Apc/Min mice.107 It has been reported that increased expression of these cytokines in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to compensatory activation of TLR4.30, 108 Therefore, enhanced tumorigenesis in TLR2\u2212/\u2212 mice may involve TLR4 signaling.",

This is possible because MyD88 transduces multiple receptor signaling pathways, including most TLRs, IL-1R, and IL-18R, which individually lead to the induction of a distinct set of genes.113 Therefore, tumorigenesis induced by AOM-DSS treatment in MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice may differ from that in TLR2- or TLR4-deficient mice.",

Extensive studies in animal models of colitis have provided several key points of the contribution of individual PRRs and their effector pathways in the pathogenesis of colitis. Epithelial PRR signaling mainly promotes mucosal protection through induction of pathways that leads to cell proliferation and survival or cytoprotection in response to mucosal injury. By contrast, it is likely that PRR signaling in hematopoietic cells is responsible for induction of local inflammation in response to invading pathogens. These PRR signals may be enhanced during chronic inflammation in the intestine. Continuous activation of abnormal PRR signaling leads to the development of neoplasms. In this regard, PRR signaling is involved in multiple aspects of intestinal tumorigenesis as well as host anti-tumor immunity. Manipulation of PRR signaling as therapeutic strategies of human diseases has just begun. Not only targeting particular PRR signaling but targeting upstream signaling or downstream effector molecules such as caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2 or IL-18 may be beneficial to develop novel strategies for managing IBD and prevention of colorectal cancer in those patients.",

Upon recognition of pathogens, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (mainly TLR4) induces transcription of IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2. Expression of mRNA for these genes produces pro-forms of IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 protein within the cytosol. At the same time, TLR signaling induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and following release of mitochondrial DNA, which activates nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). NLRs are also activated by detecting various ligands introduced via phagocytosis followed by lysosomal stabilization, bacterial type III secretion system, or intracellular metabolic and/or enzymatic activities. The activated NLRs are homo- or hetero-oligomalized to form multi-protein complex termed \u201cinflammasome\u201d that activate caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 induces proteolytic conversion of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1\u03b2 to mature IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 to release the active form of these cytokines.
