In response to a lack of COVID-19 testing the FDA issued guidance regarding serologic assays, stating that although manufacturers could use the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway for approval, serologic assays could also be marketed in the US bypassing this approval process (2) . This has led to a dramatic availability of serologic tests, most of which from companies with little to no track record in the in vitro diagnostic market. At the time of writing, more than 100 manufacturers have notified the FDA that they are offering / plan to offer serologic testing in the US and only 4 have received EUA clearance. (3) . This represents an unprecedented release of manufacturer developed laboratory tests that have not been reviewed by the FDA. Some have appeared in non-peer reviewed preprint servers and have both gained attention and generated criticism in the lay press. Nonetheless, calls for serologic testing for COVID-19 have continued to gain momentum. Serology has been suggested to play three roles in the COVID-19 pandemic; 1) diagnosis, 2) identification of convalescent plasma donors, 3) screening populations with the purpose of determining exposure and immunity.",

In our hospital, the median time from onset of symptoms to patient presentation is 3 days (mean ~5 days), making serologic diagnosis unlikely at the time of initial patient evaluation. Many have suggested the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM to detect early infections and many lateral flow-based devices include IgM. However, most IgM based assays suffer from higher false positive rates relative to IgG based assays (5) . Due to these limitations molecular techniques are favored for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, sensitivity limitations have been noted with molecular testing, directing providers to alternate means of testing in PCR-negative patients with compatible symptoms. The utility of serologic testing in this setting has yet to be established. In our experience, testing of patients previously negative by COVID-19 PCR revealed a small subset of serologically positive patients (~1% of symptomatic, PCR negative patients). While the exact disease status of these patients is difficult to adjudicate, these findings suggest a limited niche for diagnostic serologic testing. This Presumably, patients with high anti-SARS-CoV-2 titers would be the ideal donor population, making this a useful application. Further studies are needed to demonstrate if antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are neutralizing and provide protection at the same level at which they are detected. Furthermore, since many serologic assays do not provide quantitative results, there are limited mechanisms for distinguishing between donors with high titers of antibody versus those with low titers. If there is an intent to convert qualitative assays to quantitative assays for this purpose they must be evaluated as such (including an assessment of precision spanning the reportable range).",

Even a laboratory test with excellent sensitivity and specificity is often unhelpful in low-prevalence settings. Here specificity and the incidence of false positive results must be accurately determined. If the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population is 20% a test with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% will make the value of a positive result (PPV) 92.5% (Figure 1 ). In New York City, the estimated prevalence is 1.69% (9), therefore if a serologic test has a specificity of 99.5%, the PPV is 76.6%. However, if the specificity is lowered to 98%, the PPV plummets to 45%; or ~1:2 positive results is a false positive. In such a scenario one half of those cleared to return to work would not have SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and would be at risk of acquiring and transmitting infection. In cities and states with lower prevalence such as Missouri (0.1%) (10), even a specificity of 99.5% will result in a PPV of 16.4%. , Understanding the correlations between prevalence, specificity, and PPV is a necessity before implementing serologic testing for screening.",

Given the homology of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, it is likely that antigens used as targets in poorly designed assays will cross react. This risk is exaggerated in older populations who are likely to have been exposed to a wider variety of coronaviruses (12) . Many serologic assays also cross-react in patients with EBV, rheumatoid factor, and heterophile antibodies. Careful antigen selection in COVID-19 serological assays is required to avoid cross reactivity of anti-seasonal coronavirus antibodies. If validation studies are not designed appropriately (ie. if only young, asymptomatic pre-pandemic patients are used as the negative population), then these limitations may not be thoroughly vetted and specificity of the assay may be grossly overestimated.",

This is particularly true of assays without an EUA whose performance may be variable.

Ideally this would be performed serially to determine the sensitivity at various days post-symptom onset. The CLSI also recommends 50 specimens to determine clinical specificity. While these recommendations are helpful, the rigor of the validation should ultimately be dependent on the intended test population (13) .
