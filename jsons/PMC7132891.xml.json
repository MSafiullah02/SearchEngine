In 2018, there were an estimated 228 million cases and 405,000 related deaths [1], most of which were children in the WHO African region. After an unprecedented decrease in the malaria burden following introduction of Coartem\u00ae, the decrease in malaria incidence and death has since reached a plateau, largely due to infrequent and unsustainable supply of current interventions. An effective malaria vaccine is urgently needed, but its development is extremely challenging due to several immune evasion mechanisms both in the mosquito vector and human host.",

            "text": "Plasmodium falciparum serine repeat antigen (Pf-SERA) is an asexual blood stage antigen, so named because of the stretch of serine residues found in its amino acid sequence [2]. Pf-sera was initially considered a single gene; however, the P. falciparum genome project revealed that Pf-sera resides in a multi-locus forming gene family. Eight genes, Pf-sera1 to Pf-sera8, are clustered in tandem on chromosome 2 [3]. Pf-sera9 was later found on chromosome 9 [4]. Notably, due to the N-terminal truncated form of Pf-SERA8, it was previously considered a pseudogene; however, further studies demonstrated that Pf-sera8 was transcribed at the sporozoite stage [5]. The first identified Pf-SERA was Pf-sera5, which is the only family member containing a serine stretch. Its N-terminal 47 kDa domain (SE47) has been studied as a candidate vaccine antigen [6] and shows promise as (i) antibodies against this domain inhibit parasite growth in vitro [7\u201312]; and (ii) sero-epidemiological studies in malaria endemic areas have reported a negative correlation between parasitemia and anti-SE47 antibody titers [13, 14]. When originally designated as a multigene family, SERA were believed to be important for antigenic variation, which refers to the parasite\u2019s ability to present a variety of antigenic molecules on the surface of infected red blood cells (RBC) to facilitate immune evasion [15]. However, the Pf-sera family, has been shown to not exhibit antigenic variation. Moreover, transcriptional analysis revealed that all Pf-sera genes, except for Pf-sera8, are transcribed nearly simultaneously [11].",

Following release of the P. falciparum draft genome, genome projects focused on several Plasmodium species have been accelerated resulting in characterization of the SERA multigene family structure in these species. In addition, functional studies have been performed at various points in the parasite life-cycle to better understand this multigene family. Herein, we review recent progress in these areas.",

Eight genes, Pf-sera1 to Pf-sera8, were clustered in tandem between two conserved genes: a hypothetical protein gene and the iron-sulfur assembly protein gene. Currently, the Plasmodium genome data, available in public databases, has more than 200 sera gene sequences from 26 Plasmodium species (Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S1). Each Plasmodium has multiple numbers of sera genes that are generally tandemly arranged on a chromosome in similar order as Pf-sera1 to Pf-sera8. Sera genes found outside of the cluster, such as Pf-sera9, were found in avian malaria parasites and in Laverania, a subgenus of Plasmodium, which contain P. falciparum and related ape parasites. Among Laverania species, gene synteny was observed, with the location and arrangement of sera genes determined to be identical to that of Pf-sera, with the exception of P. reichenowi (chimpanzee parasite) and P. blacklocki (gorilla parasite), both of which lack the Pf-sera3 orthologue [18]. Of note, the number of sera genes in P. adleri (another gorilla parasite) also remains uncertain due to ambiguous genome mapping of the sera gene region [18]. Furthermore, in the avian P. relictum (Pr), Pr-sera1 and Pr-sera2 are located in tandem on chromosome 4 while Pr-sera3 is located on chromosome 9; meanwhile in the avian P. gallinaceum (Pg), the location of each gene has not yet been assigned to specific chromosomes. Nevertheless, Pg-sera1 and Pg-sera2 have been identified as being tandemly located on the same contig while Pg-sera3 is located elsewhere.",

            "text": "Transcription of Group I sera genes was detected primarily during the mosquito stage, while that of Group II to IV was observed during the blood stage in the vertebrate host [18]. Among 26 Plasmodium species, the number of sera genes in tandem cluster varied from 2 (in two avian parasites) to 14 (in P. gonderi, excluding a truncated sera gene [19]). Apart from avian parasites, the difference in the number of genes is always found in serine-type Group IV sera genes. The ML tree suggests that the generation of Group II and III sera genes would have occurred after the divergence of avian parasites, as sera1 of the avian parasites is positioned at the branch leading to the common ancestors of Group II and III sera genes [16]. The ML tree also suggested that gene duplication(s) of the Group IV sera genes occurred independently in each lineage, generating multiple numbers of Group IV sera genes. The number of Group IV sera genes remarkably increased in some primate Plasmodium species (Figs. 1b, 2b). Like other multigene families, the Plasmodium sera multigene family was considered to be driven by birth-and-death evolution [17]. This model assumes that new genes are created by gene duplications, and that some duplicated genes can be maintained in the genome for a long time while other genes become deleted or non-functional through deleterious mutations [20]. Gene loss, gene truncation, and pseudogenization were observed in Group IV sera genes of primate parasites except for P. malariae, P. ovale and Laveranian species [17]. These processes may be associated with an evolutionary event that involves the acquisition of a new enzymatic pathway, expansion of host range and/or activation of new roles in host immune evasion.",

The 47 kDa fragment is linked to the 18 kDa fragment via a disulfide bond and localizes to the merozoite surface [28, 29]. The 56 kDa fragment containing the papain-like catalytic domain is further cleaved by an unknown protease to 50 kDa and 6 kDa fragments just before parasite egress [22, 27, 28]. Since the cleavage of the 56 kDa fragment is sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitors, for example E64, leupeptin and iodoacetoamide, the unknown protease is also believed to be a cysteine protease [28]. PfSUB1-mediated Pf-SERA5 processing is required for efficient egress from host erythrocytes [30].",

Hence, Pf-SERA5 contributes an essential function that cannot be compensated by other members of the SERA family [22]. Furthermore, conditional disruption of Pf-SERA5 suggested its importance in regulating the kinetics and efficiency of parasite egress [35]. Pf-SERA5 also interacts with calcium dependent protein kinase 1 (PfCDPK1). Phosphorylation of Pf-SERA5 by PfCDPK1 boosts cytosolic Ca2+ levels, which serves as a trigger for merozoite egress [36].",

In contrast, Pf-SERA6-null parasites successfully ruptured the PVM yet failed to rupture RBC membrane to release the merozoites. Thus, Pf-SERA6 activated by PfSUB1 is required for the disassembly of the RBC cytoskeleton.

Under E64-treatment, host hepatocytes and PVM were intact and no Pb-SERA3 secretion to the host cell cytoplasm was observed in P. berghei-infected cells [41].

The number of both repeats vary among field isolates as well as laboratory parasite lines [44, 45]. In addition, there are 13-mer insertion/deletion and 17-mer dimorphic regions close to the serine stretch region [44, 45]. One epitope in the octamer region at amino acid positions 59\u201372 (PF3D7_0207600) [18] was shown to be the target of parasite growth inhibitory antibodies in vitro [8, 46] and was perfectly conserved in 445 worldwide isolates of P. falciparum [45]. Polymorphic sites in non-repeat regions of Pf-sera5 (2562 bp) was limited to only 24 nucleotide sites. The ratio of dN (the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site), dS (the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site), and Tajima\u2019s D test did not detect any strong signature for positive selection in the non-repeat regions of Pf-sera5 [45]. The nucleotide diversity of non-repeat regions of Pf-sera5 is comparable to the housekeeping genes of P-type Ca2+-ATPase (serca) and adenylosuccinate lyase (adsl) (Fig. 5). This is an advantage in the current efforts to develop an effective vaccine, since overcoming antigenic diversity remains a key challenge with most vaccine candidates tested in clinical trials. In contrast to Pf-sera5, major immune target antigen genes of P. falciparum, such as apical membrane protein 1 (ama1), csp and merozoite surface antigen 1 (msp1), show high nucleotide diversity (\u03b8s) and significant levels of positive selection (dN > dS) driven most probably by immune pressure [47] (Fig. 5). Notably, an early stage clinical trial and follow-up study in Uganda for the vaccine candidate based on the Pf-SERA5 47 kDa domain, showed that vaccination reduced clinical malaria in the vaccine cohort [48], although assessment of strain-specific response is needed.",

The nucleotide diversities of the five sera genes of Plasmodium chabaudi (Pc) are similar among the gene family members. Pc-sera nucleotide diversity was higher than all Pf-sera genes and Group I to III Pv-sera genes; however, lower than certain Group IV Pv-sera genes. No significant positive selection (dN > dS) was detected for both Pv-sera and Pc-sera genes, rather it is evident that purifying selection (dS > dN) is acting on Pv-sera and Pc-sera genes marked with an asterisk in Fig. 6. The purifying selection is thought to be due to functional and structural constraints. This suggests that sera genes under selective pressure must be functionally active.",

In contrast, the polymorphism of Pf-sera5 is very limited with no significant immune pressure detected. The N-terminal 47 kDa domain of Pf-SERA5 induced growth inhibitory antibodies in mice [12, 53] and humans [11, 12, 54]. Although a large amount of Pf-SERA5 is released into P. falciparum-infected human blood [29], the seroconversion rate of the 47 kDa domain among residents of a malaria endemic area in the Solomon Islands was much lower than that of Pf-MSP1 [14]. These data suggest that the 47 kDa fragment is less immunogenic. A recent study showed that the 47 kDa fragment bound to host vitronectin, which in turn bound to other host proteins to prevent phagocytosis of merozoites, highlighting a camouflage strategy that facilitates the parasite escape from the host immune response [55]. This phenomena was observed in the Ugandan Phase Ib trial, which reported a linear decrease in the number of vaccine responders with increasing age from 6\u201310 years-old, 11\u201315 years-old, and 16\u201320 years-old, with only a few vaccine responders observed in the adult cohort (21\u201335 years-old) [48]. In contrast, 100% seroconversion was reported in a Phase Ia trial with malaria-naive Japanese adults [14]. These observations suggest that exposure to repeated natural infections in malaria-endemic areas, as well as the ability of the 47 kDa fragment to bind to host vitronectin, dampens the immune response, thereby, causing the vaccinated individual to become \u2018tolerant\u2019. Without immune-driven selection pressure, Pf-SERA5 polymorphisms remain limited.",

Similarly, disruption of Plasmodium yoelii (Py)-sera1 and Py-sera2, which showed higher transcription levels in virulent compared to avirulent parasite lines, did not affect parasite survival in vivo, although the lethality of the parasite was attenuated [57]. In contrast, Pf-SERA5 is essential for P. falciparum growth [22, 27, 32\u201334].

While initial studies showed Pf-SERA5 to be involved in membrane rupture and parasite egress, the cysteine protease active center of this (pseudo)protease is replaced with a serine residue, and several seminal studies have failed to show protease activity. Group IV SERA, to which Pf-SERA5 belongs, consists of several serine-type SERA resulting from repeated gene duplication events. Hence, Group IV SERA may have acquired new functions during the evolution of the malaria parasite. In P. falciparum, SERA5 was shown to function as a regulator of merozoite egress and was also found to interact with host proteins to evade host immunity; meanwhile, P. yoelii SERA2 was inferred to be associated with parasite virulence. In P. vivax, synonymous mutations found to accumulate in certain Group IV sera genes suggest their contribution to the parasite\u2019s life-cycle. The acquisition of various functions through gene duplication would provide high parasite adaptability allowing for the expansion of host range and increased fitness. The cysteine-type SERA (Group III), Pf-SERA6 and Pb-SERA3, showed protease activity and are responsible for merozoite egress. However, the activity of Pb-SERA3 appears multifunctional, as it has been detected in the host liver and is also selectively expressed in the male gametocyte. Further, gene disruption of Pb-sera5 (Group I SERA) demonstrated its role in sporozoite egress from oocysts. Hence, it is clear that all functions of the SERA family have not yet been elucidated and characterized, and thus, requires further investigation. In parasitology, multigene families are described primarily as being associated with immune evasion strategies by amplifying serologically different allelic types. However, the observations in the sera gene family suggest the possibility for other important roles of these families. The development of innovative methods would lead to an increased understanding of the SERA family.",

The gene IDs in PlasmoDB [18] were PF3D7_0207600 and PF3D7_0207300, for Pf-SERA5 and Pf-SERA8, respectively. Amino acid positions for the Pf-SERA5 fragments are: 47 kDa corresponding to 23\u2013390 aa; 50 kDa: 391\u2013842 aa; 6 kDa: 843\u2013886 aa; and 18 kDa: 887\u2013997 aa. Black arrows indicate the PfSUB1 cleavage sites. The 50 kDa + 6 kDa fragment is further processed by an unknown protease (gray arrow). b Localization of Pf-SERA5 in the parasitophorous vacuole. Left image shows an infected red blood cell with schizont stage malaria parasites inside the parasitophorous vacuole. Right image, N-terminal antisera was used to localize Pf-SERA5 within a schizont parasitized red blood cell. Viewed under JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (18,000\u00d7 magnification).
