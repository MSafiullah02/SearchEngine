Although various approaches have been adopted for the eradication of malaria, still it remains a major health concern, particularly where it acquires an endemic dimension. Thus, malaria has drawn the attention of many researchers, especially in developing countries. This is due to the death of the children, pregnant women, and HIV-infected patients due to malaria [1]. According to the WHO, the worldwide total number of 219 million cases of malaria were reported in 2017 and out of the reported cases, 435,000 clinical death occurred. Although the disease is reported worldwide, yet most affected areas are tropical and subtropical regions. The causative organism of malaria is a protozoan pathogen of Plasmodium species. Malaria in humans is caused by four species of Plasmodium, e.g., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale. However, 5th species of Plasmodium is also reported, which normally infects animals; it is P. knowlesi. Malaria is transmitted by Plasmodium-infected female anopheles bites. Infected female anopheles injects sporozoite into the blood during its blood meal. Sporozoites travel through the vasculature from the skin and infect liver [2].",

The emergence of resistance against drugs and evasion of immune could lead to excessively high morbidity and mortality. It is not only drug resistance that is developed by the parasite but also pathogen borne toxicity; thus, they are a major concern. Other factors including patient compliance, misdiagnosis, incorrect dosing, poor drug quality, and poor living conditions taken together are responsible for the failure of malaria treatment. Therefore, this seems to be an imperative that delivery systems based on the current cutting edge technologies should be developed capable of circumventing the possibilities of drug resistance development. Because of various drawbacks of present malaria treatment as highlighted above, it is desirable that an attempt should be made to replace conventional monotherapy with combination therapy which reportedly reduces the occurrence of drug resistance. However, combination therapy too could not assure complete eradication of malaria infection [3]. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) have become a primary clinical choice which results in rapid clearance of parasite. The combination therapy, however, appears to be costly and also suffers some added side effects. It is also dependent on the socioeconomic condition, drug-drug interaction, drug-food interactions, lacking the drug quality distributed in the malarious region, and self-medication which add to the existing challenges. Nevertheless, gene sequencing of P. falciparum and advancement in malaria genetics present several novel molecular targets for effective drug designing and also for targeted drug delivery [4]. Currently, various pharmaceutical companies and research agencies are involved in the drug discovery and development process of antimalarial therapy, which could be accomplished with the advancements of novel drugs with better pharmacokinetic profile and cost-effectiveness and also suitable for the children and pregnant women [3]. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation of drawbacks of current antimalarial drug therapy.",

The erythrocytic membrane also contains proteins, which serve as receptors and transporters. Hence, antimalarial drugs can reach their target either by carrier-mediated transportation or diffusion through lipid membrane. Carrier-mediated transportation is referred to as facilitated diffusion in case energy is not utilized or active transport if energy is consumed in the process. Carrier-mediated transportation is saturable, subjected to inhibition and stereospecific. Uncharged chemicals exhibit lipid-based diffusion; however, charged molecules are not able to cross the lipid membrane [5].",

Nanocarriers are below < 1000 nm in size. They are essentially colloidal nanoparticles characterized by high surface area to volume ratio [6]. Nanocarriers should be designed appreciating some important parameters including plasma concentration which is directly proportional to the toxic effects of the drugs and efficacy that in turn directly correlates with the area under the curve (AUC). Thus, to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug and achieve high drug concentration at the target site, these parameters become of paramount significance. PEGylated nanocarriers reportedly enhance the drug efficacy, reduce the dose of the drug, reduce the dosage frequency, and improve the AUC of the drug. The contact period or circulation time of nanocarrier is of importance in the treatment of malaria. Long circulation time enhances the interaction between RBCs and nanocarriers, ultimately leading to iRBCs specific targeting and improved efficacy [7].",

            "text": "The exact mechanism by which nanocarrier contained antimalarials are delivered to the infected RBCs is not clear. There are two proposed mechanisms, referred to as the traditional sequence pathway and a parallel pathway. Infected RBCs become leakier as compared with the normal RBC to fulfill their nutritional requirements from the extra RBC environment (fluid). Nanocarrier which is of the size below < 80 nm diameter may have direct access to the infected RBCs due to their leakiness. Thus, nanocarriers reach within the infected RBCs along with the contents. Selectivity could also be achieved by exploring this proposed mechanism because normal RBCs do not have a leaky membrane and hence a nanocarrier may enter directly into the infected RBCs only. Another proposed mechanism is membrane fusion, i.e., a drug bearing formulation fuses with iRBC membrane. There is a basic dissimilarity between these two pathways about the role of the cytosol of RBC. In the first proposed mechanism, nanocarrier is noticed to bypass the cytosol of RBC; in contrast, drug molecule passes through the cytosol in case of the second mechanism. New permeation pathways (NPP) are responsible for enhanced permeability of iRBCs to a small solute. Tubovesicular membrane (TVM) arises from the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane that extends up to RBC membrane [8] (Fig. 3). TVM is near NPP, so nanocarrier having a size below 80 nm may sink directly into parasite while escaping the cytosol of RBCs. The secondary mechanism involves membrane fusion and active targeting to the iRBCs. In this mechanism, the drug enters the parasite via cytosol of the iRBC [9].",

The phenomenon has a unique spin-off in case of carcinoma where the leaky neovasculature exists. Due to leakiness of tumor-associated vessels, a nanocarrier retained at tumor site and thus yielding comparatively better therapeutic effects due to target accumulation of carrier and hence the drug. The permeation associated phenomenon may also operate in case of iRBCs which are leaky to meet out the requirements of nutrients specifically by needed parasite. However, no systematic studies are available in the literature on iRBCs membrane-associated that are pores, their size and their role in nutrients capture and supply.

Alteration of the surface properties of nanocarriers such as PEGylation prevents its opsonization and further clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) [11]. PEGylation is the phenomenon where nanocarriers are modified with the covalent conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Moreover, circulation time also increases by an increase in the molecular weight of the PEG chain. PEGylation is used to overcome various drawbacks associated with the biopharmaceutical parameters of a drug/carrier such as pharmacokinetic properties, drug solubility, immunogenicity, and low retention time. It enhances the retention time of the nanocarrier in the blood which is a prerequisite in the case of malaria [12]. Raza et al. prepared the long circulatory liposomal formulation of maduramicin, which exhibited excellent growth inhibition of blood-stage P. falciparum parasite in culture and cures murine model of experimental malaria. They reported that maduramicin in the PEGylated liposomal formulation shows enhanced antiplasmodial activity in vitro compared with the plain maduramicin. It is active against a chloroquine-resistant murine model of malaria and devoid of toxic effects and could prevent the progression of the disease. It also displayed an extended plasma clearance rate, which enhances and favors drug accumulation particularly in infected RBCs [13].

Based on this principle, Jain et al. prepared a glyceryl-dilaurate nano lipid carriers (GDL-NLCs) for the delivery of antimalarials and tested them in a murine malaria model. Infected RBCs were selectively targeted and impaired by the GDL-NLCs. GDL was used as a targeting ligand GDL-NLCs was primarily accumulated within the mitochondria of the Plasmodium.

IC50 value of CQ-SLN and CQ-Hep-SLN was found to be 4.72 \u00b1 0.14 ng/mL and 2.41 \u00b1 0.27 ng/mL respectively. These findings suggest that SLNs have superior in vitro activity than chloroquine when tested on chloroquine-sensitive parasite [29].",

Cytotoxicity studies were carried out by measuring the viability of HL60 cells and human granulocytes. Chemiluminescence measurements were carried out to quantify the particle internalization. The results revealed that viability does not get affected by the nature of lipid. Following binding to the SLNs surface, the cytotoxic effect of surfactants such as poloxamer tends to decrease significantly. Thus, SLNs exhibited relatively low cytotoxicity as compared with other nanoparticles, i.e., polylactic/glycolic acid and polyalkylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Thus, SLNs demonstrated great potential as a drug carrier system for the intravenous administration [42].",

Thus, to enhance its immunogenicity, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged Pfs25 is mixed with the preformed liposomes which contain cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid; thus at the time of immunization, nanoliposome antigen particleization (SNAP) 762 formation takes place. The antigen is stably presented on phospholipid bilayer, without covalent modification, and hence retains antigen conformation. The histidine-tagged P. falciparum polypeptide was found to induce strong antibody production and could be useful in the preparation of multistage particulate vaccines using SNAP for immunization [64].",

Seemingly, it can improvise the existing conventional drug delivery modules and also it can improve the therapeutic outcome of the drug discernibly and may allow curtailing down the contraindicated manifestations well below the tolerable limits. Most of the nano biotechnological have demonstrated improved and effective performance at preclinical stages. However, the results at the end have been discouraging due to toxicological and interactive manifestations of such drug delivery systems. There appears to be a gap between preclinical and clinical phases inviting intensive, consistent, and sincere attention of researchers to logistically design and develop the systems for their safe and effective use. It is appreciated that the molecular interplay involved in the malaria parasite invasion and its subsequent proliferation and molecular mechanistic involved therein can open up the vistas of multiple options, opportunity, potential, and promises based on molecular events and judicious intervention thereon, which could only be possible through nanobiotechnological stratagems. The target (infected RBCs) could be selectively delivered with a load of drug which could not only eradicate the parasitemia but also the problem associated with drug resistance that emerges due to sub-therapeutic drug exposure. The nanobiotechnology may include the use of site-directing antibodies, aberrant and variant expression of protein determinant on infected cells, biodevices developed as a variant, and bioprocesses and also the smart material which could be developed by structuring a drug/drug(s) carrier selective or with proficiency to the target site. Adding to the proposed possibilities, the molecular modifications as nutrient-based prodrug and antimetabolites could be other possible diversities that can be brought in place in the designing, development, and tailoring of drug delivery systems for exclusive use in cell-selective targeted drug delivery.",

Nanobiotechnology provides various opportunities, which could improve conventional malaria therapy. Poor solubility, low oral bioavailability, toxicity, chemical instability, poor pharmacokinetic properties, the short half-life of the drug, drug resistance, and non-specific drug targeting are the main drawbacks of conventional therapy. However, nanobiotechnology overcomes the abovementioned shortcomings to some extent. The journey ahead is long to recognize an effective combination of molecules, which will enhance therapeutic indices and devoid of side effects. Safety and scalability are two important parameters for targeted antimalarial therapy. Liposomes, especially PEGylated liposomes, seem to be an effective drug delivery system for incorporating antimalarial drugs. The polymeric nanocarriers are less exploited for malaria. Surface modification of the nanocarriers may improve the drug targeting and efficacy of the treatment. The nanobiotechnology thus may help design the smart, well-tolerated, low cost, and effective therapeutic drug delivery systems for the complete eradication of malaria.",
