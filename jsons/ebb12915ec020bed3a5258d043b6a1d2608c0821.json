Following Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier. As a smart city which strengthens precise epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai has established a multi-department platform named \"one-net management\" on dynamic information monitoring. By sharing epidemiological data with medical institutions under a safe environment, we believe that the ability to prevent and control epidemics among medical institutions will be effectively and comprehensively improved.",

As Gedela, the National Health Service (NHS) consultant physician from London, mentioned, one reason for the World Health Organization's declaration of this outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern was to try to limit the spread of virus outside densely populated countries with weaker health systems [4] . We fully agree with Gedela's opinion that COVID-19 highlights the need of greater financial and diagnostic supports for global health care. Besides that, based on lessons learned from the practice in preventing COVID-19, we would like to focus more on the support strategies such as epidemiological information sharing, mainly for medical institutions in megacities with a population over 20 million.",

Since controlling sources of infection and cutting off transmission are critical methods for COVID-19 prevention, strict pre-examination and triage measures including epidemiological survey and temperature measurement need to be taken before patients see a doctor [6] . However, patients crowd at the gate of the hospital, with the shortage of medical staff and personal protective equipment, which increases the infection risk. In addition, because the pre-examination staff could not confirm personal information provided by patients, they often have to check repeatedly during the epidemiological survey. All these inevitably increase the cost of avoiding any potential infection. The history of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms will definitely help improve the efficiency of epidemic diagnoses, while an inter-connected and collaborative healthcare joint information system within all medical institutions has not been established yet. The lack of system leads to the difficulty in early warning and treatment.",
