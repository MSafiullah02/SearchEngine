Confronted by a steadily increasing number of secondary metabolites and a growing number of molecular targets relevant in the therapy of human disorders, the huge amount of information needs to be handled. Virtual screening filtering experiments already showed great promise for dealing with large libraries of potential bioactive molecules. It can be utilized for browsing databases for molecules fitting either an established pharmacophore model or a three dimensional (3D) structure of a macromolecular target. However, for the discovery of natural lead candidates the application of this in silico tool has so far almost been neglected. There are several reasons for that. One concerns the scarce availability of natural product (NP) 3D databases in contrast to synthetic libraries; another reason is the problematic compatibility of NPs with modern robotized high throughput screening (HTS) technologies. Further arguments deal with the incalculable availability of pure natural compounds and their often too complex chemistry. Thus research in this field is time-consuming, highly complex, expensive and ineffective. Nevertheless, naturally derived compounds are among the most favorable source of drug candidates. A more rational and economic search for new lead structures from nature must therefore be a priority in order to overcome these problems.",

Such integrated virtual screening workflows are outlined here and shall help to motivate NP researchers to dare a step towards this powerful in silico tool.",

Nevertheless, most large pharmaceutical companies scaled down or terminated their work in NPs operations. The reasons behind this are that the drug discovery process starting from natural sources is hardly compatible with the today's highly automated drug discovery technologies. Thus, the pre-eminence of combinatorial chemistry as the preferred method for generating new drug leads has led to the comparative neglect of this valuable resource. William Strohl from Merck Research Laboratories summarized the difficulties of NP programs versus synthetic chemicals in his editorial remarks in Drug Discovery Today [4] . These include (i) the existence of already found potent antimicrobic and antitumor NPs and the lack of sufficient dereplication programs which prevent their repeated discovery; (ii) the fact that -in contrast to the highly sophisticated molecular targets -NP extracts are generally regarded as too 'dirty', too difficult to assay and too time-consuming; (iii) obtaining an assay hit resulting from a bio-guided fractionation, the NPs' structure still has to be elucidated compared with synthetic chemicals; (iv) NPs are often deemed as too structurally complex, possessing multiple hydroxyl moieties, ketones and chiral centers. Strohl nevertheless concluded by listing a number of advantages applying an active NP program, which he finally described as an 'expensive endeavor' which, however, is 'well worth the cost'.",

NP research is affected with a wealth of time-consuming and cost intensive investigations.

A characteristic workflow of this procedure is given in Figure 1 . Starting from the knowledge or assumption about a biological effect the natural material is selected and adequately extracted. If a positive effect in the obtained multi-component extract is recorded, it is attempted to trace it back to the active principle/s by intense phytochemical and analytical investigations (Fig. 1 ). This can for instance be achieved by a bioactivity-guided fractionation. A more targeted approach focuses on innovative technological tools combining analytical and biological information. An overview of recent developments in this area and successful examples thereof are presented by Potterat and Hamburger [18, 19] . As soon as the constituent regarded to be responsible for the overall effect is isolated, further research focuses on a molecular level including structure elucidation and pharmacological profiling. Synthesis and testing of series of derivatives enable an insight into a structure-activity-relationship and pharmacokinetic aspects. Finally, potential drug leads become drug candidates after some intense toxicological studies and after the verified effectiveness in vivo (Fig. 1) .",

In the area of medicinal chemistry, computational methods, like virtual screening experiments, have already proved to satisfy these requirements. They are needed to exploit the available structural information, to understand specific molecular recognition events, and to clarify the function of the target macromolecule. Though rationalized procedures in the search for bioactive natural products are in great demand to find the 'needles in a haystack', computational assistance could hardly break into natural product research.",

Within this context, the scoring of hits retrieved still remains a question that is often discussed. In fact, currently the major weakness of docking programs lies not in the docking algorithms themselves but still in the inaccuracy of the functions that are used to estimate the affinity between ligand and target, the so-called scoring functions. Previously, Stahl and Rarey analyzed scoring functions for virtual screening [32] , giving valuable insight into strengths and weaknesses of currently used models for affinity estimation. The combination of several different scoring functions termed as consensus scoring turns out to be one of the possible answers to the question raised previously. In fact, several authors recently described their efforts in this area; an example is given in reference [33] . In a theoretical study, other authors demonstrate that consensus scoring outperforms any single scoring for simple statistical reasons and that a moderate number of scoring functions (i.e., three or four) are sufficient for the purpose of consensus scoring [34] . However, it has been shown that consensus scoring alone is not suitable for all cases of docking, and, as highlighted in a recent review by Krovat and co-authors, considerable efforts are still devoted to the optimization of scoring functions [28] .",

Profiling of combinatorial libraries and compound classification are other often-used applications of this concept. Although well established in combinatorial chemistry, it has to be pointed out that the tools described in this section have likewise a considerable impact on the rational finding of new potential lead compounds originating from the immense source of secondary metabolites. The prior use of pharmacophore models in biological screening of NPs is an efficient procedure since it quickly eliminates molecules that do not possess the required features thus leading to a dramatic increase of enrichment, when compared to a purely random screening experiment. In a previous study conducted by Doman and co-authors [41] , only 85 molecules or 0.021% revealed as protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B inhibitors (IC 50 < 100 \u00b5M) by a HTS of approximately 400,000 compounds. On the other hand, of 365 molecules suggested by molecular docking, 127 or 34.8% were found to be active.

This must be considered for synthetics as well as NPs, though studies revealed secondary metabolites not only high scaffold diversity; biosynthesized molecules also show structural and spatial characteristics that are closer to drug leads than those of synthetic molecules [46, 47] . Typically, NPs include more chiral centers and their stereochemical architecture is much more complex than that of synthetic molecules. Furthermore, they usually contain more carbons, hydrogen and oxygen, however, less nitrogen and other atoms compared to synthetics. Surprisingly, NPs often show a molecular weight higher than 500 Da combined with a high polarity [7] , which is in clear contrast to Lipinski's rule of five [48] .

A unique platform containing 3D coordinates of experimentally solved protein structures is the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB [50] ). A crystalline complex with a ligand bound to a protein's active site is the best requirement to start the construction of a structure-based 3D model. In this case, one may profit from the exact information of the ligand's bioactive conformation which is preserved in the binding site of the crystalline complex. The building of a structure-based pharmacophore is depicted in a step by step way in Figure 3 .",

            "text": "A new software tool has recently been described for the successful generation of such chemical features-based models: The software LIGAND-SCOUT [51] is a program for ligand interpretation and data mining in the PDB. The performance of this program allows the detection of relevant interaction points between ligand and protein. The binding mode of the ligand in the active site of a protein can be visualized in a sophisticated way. LIGANDSCOUT's algorithms perform a stepwise interpretation of the ligand molecules: Planar ring detection, assignment of functional group patterns, determination of the hybridization state and finally the assignment of Kekul\u00e9 pattern. The interpretation of the ligand molecules is the basis for the next step, an automated generation of pharmacophore models, derived from the data provided by a crystalline complex of the PDB. An automatic detection and classification of protein-ligand interactions into hydrogen bonds, charge transfer, and lipophilic regions leads to a collection of chemical features in a pharmacophore model. The graphical user-interface can provide an integrated view of protein, ligand, pharmacophore model, and interaction lines. In a previously published study, LIGANDSCOUT was used for the detection and interpretation of crucial interaction patterns between ligands and the factor Xa protein structure [52] . In a second step, the program CATALYST, a state of the art virtual screening platform, was used for rapid virtual screening of multiconformational 3D structure databases. The information for the pharmacophore pattern (i.e., 3D coordinates of interaction points) was obtained by the interpretation of LIGANDSCOUT pharmacophore definitions and resulted in specific interaction models that were able to map the ligand in their bioactive conformation and to retrieve selectively a 78% fraction of the known factor Xa inhibitors within a small subset of the large Derwent World Drug Index library. A further application of the LIGANDSCOUT pharmacophore definitions covers the rationalized search for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 inhibitors by virtual screening of approximately 3.8 million compounds from various commercial databases [53] . Hit reduction and selection was achieved using a five feature hypothesis based on a recently resolved inhibitor-bound ACE2 crystal structure. Seventeen virtual hits were selected for their experimental validation in a bioassay; the concept was confirmed since all of them were revealed as ACE-2 inhibitors. Barreca and co-authors developed a 3D structure-based pharmacophore model with LIGANDSCOUT for the discovery of new scaffolds acting as HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors by virtual screening of large chemical databases. Six virtual hits were finally selected for determination of their inhibitory effects. Those belonging to the new scaffold class of the quinolin-2(1H)-one family exhibited reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity at sub-micromolar concentrations [54] .",

Whereas in usual virtual screening cycles interactions of thousands or even millions of 3D database entries are browsed against one pharmacophore model, it is contrary in the case of parallel screening; low-energetic conformers of one structure are screened for their potential interactions against numerous models. The basics of parallel screening have just recently been presented by Steindl and co-authors [56, 57] . Furthermore, the authors exemplified this strategy for the activity profiling using a set of HIV protease pharmacophore models [58] .

A possible consequence is that often scientists identify and develop novel compounds for a target using preliminary structure-activity information, together with theoretical models of interaction. Only responses that are consistent with the working hypotheses contribute to an evolution of the used models. Within this framework, the chemical feature-based pharmacophore approach has proven to be successful [62] allowing the perception and understanding of key interactions between a receptor and a ligand on a generalized level.

Compounds with potent affinities to the sigma-1 receptor known from literature were structurally aligned to derive distinct common features.

Indeed, in vitro tests attested extracts of Morus root bark a distinct COX inhibitory potential. The objective was to find the active principles from this plant material applying both different methods for their discovery. First, the computer-aided approach was used to identify the virtually active compounds able to interact with the pharmacophore models for COX-1 and -2. Second, the bioactivity-guided fractionation was conducted for the isolation of the COX-inhibiting constituents. This resulted in the isolation of nine compounds belonging to the chemical classes of sanggenons and moracins. In the enzyme assay, all the isolates showed moderate to potent inhibitory effects on COX-1 and -2. When comparing the hits of the virtual screening with the experimental data, a good correlation between predictions provided by the computer assisted method and in vitro data could be obtained in the case of the isolated sanggenons (e.g., sanggenon C; 12). However, this agreement could not be achieved with the moracins (e.g., moracin M; 13). In any case the virtual screening was particularly helpful for the decision regarding which plant material is worth extensive study. Furthermore, the disclosed interactions of the sanggenons with the pharmacophore model -miming the binding site of the target -provided us with some essential information about the molecular requirements of COX-ligands.",

Thus, it is possible to start with one compound of unknown activity and to mine it against a number of structurally disclosed targets in terms of elaborated pharmacophore models (Fig. 7) , i.e., parallel in silico screening (see previous). As soon as the orphaned molecule is able to comply with all the requirements and restrictions imposed by any model, it can be assessed as rational hint. Consequently, the focused compound will be subjected to a pharmacological testing on the predicted target/s. In this way, the parallel screening is not only helpful to estimate the interactions of a drug candidate with diverse antitargets; or to canvass its interactions to related targets as is performed for an activity profiling. In this approach, the parallel screening is a computational tool for target fishing to get a rational idea about any potential target interaction and to prioritize a few targets for experimental evaluation by applying simple ligand-based or target-based queries. The potential of virtual screening of target libraries was recently discussed by Didier Rognan [95] . In his group a structure-based method for target screening was pursued applying inverse docking [96] . The authors used 2,148 structurally well-defined PDB entries to build a 3D protein library. The virtual screening of this protein library with four unrelated ligands was suitable for recovering the true targets of specific ligands and may as well be used for virtual selectivity profiling of any ligand of interest.",

Spurred on by economic interest fundamental advances have been made in research applying data mining strategies, like virtual screening. Though being aware of both potentials, their combined benefit could only rudimentary be savored. Only limited attempts applying innovative in silico tools in NP research are pursued so far, because the search for bioactive compounds is a complex and multidisciplinary challenge. Thus, a sensible adaptation of computational strategies is in demand to profit in an economic way from the unique chemical and biological diversity associated with NPs. Virtual screening techniques, however, must not be used exclusively as activity-predicting tools, since the results provide merely an indication for a putative activity: it is only by the creation of interfaces between computational tools and well-established methods from pharmacognosy that a reasonable standard of success can be achieved. The search for the most effective strategy is best performed by a drug discovery process that involves the exploitation of all the information which can be gathered from bioactivity-guided fractionation, on-line analytical activity profiling, ethnopharmacological screening, chemoinformatics, virtual and in vitro screening studies.

The advantages implemented to a virtual screening cycle compared to a conventional in vitro screening are obvious: (i) higher capacity, (ii) no need for isolated compounds, (iii) less experimental efforts for testing; (iv) theoretically, interactions of all known NPs to all structurally defined targets can be calculated and predicted, (v) the quality of hit compounds can be increased by additional drug-like filters and virtually restricted ADME properties; thus diminishing failures in the early drug development.",
