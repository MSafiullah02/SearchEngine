We also recognize the scientists who have spent years dedicated to creating the tools and technologies to end the global HIV epidemic. On this Vaccine Awareness Day, we must acknowledge that the HIV vaccine research field is quickly approaching a critical crossroads. This past decade has been spent launching improved vaccine concepts and immune-based strategies into trials. Despite these advances, a safe and durably effective HIV vaccine has eluded us. In this regard, we must evaluate the current state of the field and make appropriate adjustments to help speed us to our goal. While this quest for a vaccine at times may feel extremely difficult, as evidenced by the recent disappointing results of a phase III efficacy trial, HVTN 702, described below, we must steadfastly move forward to address critical research gaps and unanswered questions.",

It is important to acknowledge the global response to the COVID-19 epidemic and to cite the range of vaccine platforms being used for anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines that have their origin in HIV vaccinology. The HIV vaccine field is clearly assisting in addressing this newly emergent pandemic and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is fostering these essential collaborations. For HIV Vaccine Awareness Day in 2020, we emphatically state that finding safe, effective and durable vaccines for HIV and COVID-19 are NIAID's top priorities. The world must have both.",

After the STEP trial (also referred to as HVTN 502 or Merck V520-023) was halted in 2007, vaccine candidates that fulfilled these criteria have been prioritized [1, 2] . Over the past decade, three different vaccine approaches have been implemented, possible correlates of protection identified, and two have moved through clinical evaluation to advanced clinical trials.",

Rather than perform a direct repeat of RV144 in Thailand, where the epidemic is driven by viruses from clades AE and B, a clade C-specific regimen was developed for testing in Southern Africa. When evaluated in the HVTN100 trial, the relevant correlate responses were detected and shown to be longer lasting than those of RV144 [5] [6] [7] . With the go-no-go criteria for advancement met, the HVTN702 study moved ahead. However, no protection was observed, and the trial was terminated due to futility. While the field is disappointed with this outcome, it is important to understand the possible reasons for why this occurred. First, there were significant differences in the overall incidence between the study cohorts in HVTN702 and RV144 that could have overwhelmed a modestly protective response. Additionally, it is conceivable that the correlates observed in RV144 are specific to the clades and population in Thailand and not transferable to the Southern Africa epidemic.",

Analysis of the correlates of protection seen in the non-human primate studies point to qualitatively different responses than those observed in RV144, and the trials are evaluating in silico designed immunogens to present the most globally conserved HIV sequences to trigger quantitatively superior CD8 + T cell responses [8, 9] . The third approach, still in preclinical studies, is an SIV vaccine delivered via the rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vector platform. This strategy has been shown by Picker and colleagues to protect 50 percent of monkeys from sustained infection [10] . Efforts are currently underway to transition to a human CMV vector platform with Phase 1 clinical trials expected in 2021.",

One of the most exciting developments in HIV research has been the ability to isolate and produce broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) that neutralize nearly all of circulating virus strains from all clades [11, 12] . These human antibodies prevent acquisition of SHIV infection, in a dose dependent manner, in animal challenge models and when combinations of these antibodies are used in people living with HIV, strong antiviral activity has been demonstrated. The Antibody Mediated Protection (AMP) trials are currently evaluating VRC01, the CD4 binding site targeted bNAb, to determine the ability of this single antibody to prevent HIV infection in women in Southern Africa and MSM and transgender persons in the Americas [13] . The AMP studies have not been impacted by COVID-19, and results from the AMP studies are expected in fall of 2020. If protection is observed in the AMP trials, an important correlate for future vaccine studies will be established.",
