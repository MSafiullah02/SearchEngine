The Chinese government and researchers have taken rapid measures to control the epidemic.\n1\n On January 30 2020, WHO declared that the epidemic of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). At present, the number of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is still rising, and its harm to human beings has exceeded the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, 2002.\n2\n The clinical characteristics and the case fatality rate after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection have always been concerned by people, and it is also the focus of medical workers' research at present. However, due to the different design of different clinical studies and insufficient sample size, the conclusions of the published studies were different. To acquire more accurate conclusions on the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, we searched the relevant literatures and carried out single\u2010arm meta\u2010analysis.\n3\n Our findings provide important guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.",

Wei Ji et al\n15\n found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 seemed to be a recombinant virus between bat coronavirus and coronavirus of another unknown origin. Xiao et al\n16\n confirmed that Malayan pangolins were the most likely intermediate host of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The research of Benvenuto et al\n17\n found that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was only closely related to the coronavirus isolated from the chrysanthemum\u2010headed bat in 2015. Their research suggests that bats may be the reservoir host for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. According to the research by Zhou et al\n18\n and Wu et al,\n19\n it was found that the sequence homology between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV was 79.5%. The homology between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and bat coronavirus at the genetic level was 96%. Therefore, very likely it can be confirmed that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 comes from bats.",

Infection mortality rates of SARS and MERS are 9.6%\n20\n and 35%,\n21\n respectively. Since the case fatality rate of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection is low, a large number of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection will be cured. Sheng et al\n22\n have shown that viral infection could increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Xie et al\n23\n found that 45% of patients showed signs of pulmonary fibrosis within 1 month after being infected with SARS\u2010CoV. Hui\n24\n revealed that 36% and 30% of patients infected with SARS\u2010CoV developed pulmonary fibrosis 3 and 6 months after infection. These studies consistently suggest that pulmonary fibrosis will become one of the serious complications in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. How to prevent and reduce the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection are urgent problems for medical workers in the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.",

In normal lung tissue, ACE2 is mainly expressed by type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells. It was reported that 83% of II type alveolar cells expressed ACE2. Therefore, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection causes damages to most II type alveolar cells. In addition, the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection can also aggravate the injury of alveolar cells. After alveolar cell injury, transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010 \u03b2) released in tissue promotes lung repair. Virus infection often leads to excessive activation of TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway, which leads to the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis.",

The first is the treatment of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. At present, a variety of drugs have been found to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Holshue et al\n26\n achieved remarkable results in the treatment of patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection with remdesivir. This drug is currently in clinical trials. Second, it is necessary to inhibit the inflammatory reaction and reduce exudation. In this direction, antibiotics not only have traditional antibacterial effects but also have immunomodulatory and anti\u2010inflammatory properties.\n27\n Macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin, azithromycin, and erythromycin prevent the production of proinflammatory cytokines and immune mediators.\n28\n The third is to inhibit the fibrogenic effect of TGF\u2010\u03b2. Luo et al\n29\n found that arsenic trioxide could inhibit the signal transduction of TGF\u2010\u03b2 and play a role in antifibrosis. The fourth is the rational use of ventilator to avoid unnecessary lung damages. In addition, pirfenidone and nintedanib as drugs for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can also be used to prevent and treat pulmonary fibrosis in patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.\n30\n\n",
