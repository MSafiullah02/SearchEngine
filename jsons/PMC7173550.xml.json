Obviously such a specimen must be taken from the right place and at the right time.

On the other hand, recovery of an enterovirus from the feces, or a herpesvirus from a nasal or throat swab may not necessarily be significant, because such viruses are often associated with inapparent infections at these sites.2.Interpretation of the significance of the isolation in such instances will be facilitated by recovery of the same virus from several cases of the same illness during an epizootic.3.Knowledge that the virus and the disease in question are often causally associated provides confidence that the isolate is significant.\n",

The basic principles are similar to those of radioimmunoassay (Fig. 13-3\n). Antibody is bound to a solid phase, usually the wells of a microtiter tray. Samples suspected to contain antigen are added to the wells. After an appropriate reaction time, the wells are rinsed and a second virus-specific antibody that has been conjugated to an enzyme is added. After allowing this to bind, the contents of the well are rinsed and a substrate for the enzyme is added. The assay is read by a color change in the substrate and can be made quantitative by serially diluting the antigen to obtain an end point or by photometrically reading the amount of color change, a reflection of the amount of enzyme-conjugated antibody bound. As in radioimmunoassay, there are many variations in protocol, e.g., exploiting the very high affinity of avidin for biotin (Fig. 13-3, right). Moreover, if antigen is bound to the plate first, the procedure is equally suitable for the detection and quantitation of viral antibody.",
