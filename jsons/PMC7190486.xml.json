We identified a delayed diagnosis for the entire group. Either the patients were extremely fearful about coming to the hospital or were underdiagnosed during hospitalization, as confirmed with written commentary from nurses. An arterial thrombotic event presented in two COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic despite testing positive for the disease. Blood testing demonstrated a high inflammatory response in all of these patients (D-dimer, CRP) that was significantly higher in those who were hospitalized with active and severe pneumonia. Interestingly, pro-calcitonin values were normal in all of these patients, indicating an evolving inflammatory condition. Although no strong conclusions can be drawn from this initial description, it may serve as guidance for future studies seeking to improve PAD identification.",
