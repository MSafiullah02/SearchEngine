In particular, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132003\n1\n drastically changed the perception and degree of collective engagements of states and other institutions towards infectious diseases. SARS was distinct from the pathogens that emerged in the past in the sense that it offered an unprecedented opportunity to test contemporary global collaboration as well as a regulatory approach to a new disease outbreak. SARS demonstrated that simple divisions between national and global health policy do not work in practice. During the outbreak, governments had to realise that a disease in any one part of the world is a threat to the rest of the world. However, ironically governments were in general reluctant to acknowledge the existence of the outbreak. Most notably, the Chinese government's response to SARS was critical to the functioning of global governance in infectious disease control. It is a classic textbook example and a fundamental test case of how nationalism can impede or facilitate global governance and international collaboration.",

Scholars viewed China's initial response to SARS within the context of China's poor public health infrastructure, ineffective and fragmented bureaucratic system, and political transition in leadership at the time of the outbreak. At the same time, China's remarkable U\u2010turn towards international collaboration was demonstrated in the framework of the tremendous power of international organisation (i.e. WHO) in facilitating China's submission and the changing nature of international politics where sovereignty has been curtailed (Eckholm 2006: 28). Some scholars have even gone further to argue that China's SARS episode demonstrated the governance transition from Westphalian to post\u2010Westphalian strategies (Fidler 2004; 2005).",

            "text": "Yet, despite some scholars' claims based on China's initial reluctance and subsequent acquiescence to international forces, there is no evidence that China's sovereignty has been curtailed or that China has been integrated into global health governance. While the existing literature has focused on China's stunning reversal during the SARS outbreak, less attention has been paid to the extent to which this turnaround has continued during the aftermath of SARS. Indeed, in light of the Chinese leadership's attitude and commitment towards other infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and the recent cases of avian influenza, China's newfound openness did not seem to be genuine. This leads to the following questions: What were the factors that inhibited and then facilitated the collaboration during the outbreak? What eventually brought China back to \u2018business as usual\u2019 after the outbreak? What ultimately motivates the government's agenda and actions towards infectious diseases?",

By locating nationalism as a factor which facilitates or impedes international collaboration, this paper explores how the Chinese leadership has exhibited ways in which nationalism affected much of their political decision\u2010making in their quest to restore national pride and to secure China's developmental goals and national interests. It is argued that more often than not, nationalism hindered the formulation and implementation of health policy at both the provincial and national levels. Maintaining a positive image of China in the international arena and securing the interests of the regime were key driving forces that affected policy\u2010making. More specifically, this usually revolves around the ruling elites' competency in the handling of a national crisis and in its foreign policy.",

The reaction of the Chinese authorities at both the central and provincial levels towards unknown health threats is often to deny and cover up the disease's existence. This could be in part to avoid the stigma of being a \u2018sick\u2019 nation as well as to buy time in order to search for an indigenous solution to the problem. This sort of mentality belies a negotiated basis of existence behind the modern Chinese nation \u2013 as if to say that there are no problems that modern China cannot handle or solve. Yet it is also the same desire to appear \u2018healthy\u2019, \u2018confident\u2019 and a \u2018responsible\u2019 member of the international community that often swings Chinese response to disclosure and collaboration. However, the latter only happens when the disease in question and China's handling of it is put under international scrutiny and often criticism. In short, China's compulsion to co\u2010operate with international bodies emanates out of reputational concerns rather than medical considerations.",

One of the most immediate effects is that public health threats are often securitised and political\u2010security solutions are sought rather than technical\u2010medical ones. This means that any information pertaining to the outbreak is treated as classified, and is revealed on a \u2018need to know\u2019 basis, and collaboration is discouraged. It also means that the development of treatments is often seen as an opportunity to showcase the work of indigenous scientists who are \u2018able\u2019 to come up with a cure. An interrelated point pertains to the prospect of China's integration into global health governance. Unless and until the Chinese leadership examines the nationalistic element embedded in their approach towards growing disease epidemics and globalising health challenges, China's ascendance to great power status will actually be harmed rather than helped.",

The primitive state of medical science, limited understanding of hygiene, poor sanitary conditions, and widespread poverty often enable plagues and epidemics to thrive and spread with ease. The Plague of Justinian (sixth century AD), the Black Death (fourteenth and fifteenth centuries AD), and the Bubonic Plague (1665\u20131666) stand in testimony throughout the ages to remind the world of the imagery of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse described in Revelation 6:8: \u2018And I looked, and behold, a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell had followed him\u2019.

Health policy on disease epidemics was a matter of sovereign discretion and exclusively dependent on the concerned nation's capabilities. When the Black Death (Bubonic Plague) in the fourteenth century spread through international travel and trading routes afflicted Europe and North America, quarantine measures aimed exclusively at preventing disease threats from entering a nation from outside its borders were taken in major European nations. As in defence or foreign policy, health policy is most certainly an exclusive jurisdiction of the national government or ruling regime, and on numerous occasions, great rulers who have built their empires on military conquests have seen their legitimacy to rule crumble very quickly with the unbridled spread of pandemics in their nations. Religion, as opposed to science, became the salvation from diseases and epidemics until the eighteenth century. Nonetheless, the combat of plagues and epidemics has always invariably been seen and recognised as a national \u2018problem\u2019 for leaders, even though pathogens, bacteria and epidemics in general have no respect for political borders or sovereign rights over territory or people.",

One dimension of this response was a nascent form of international conferences. These early conferences were widely supported by the economic and political elites, as they believed that the spread of epidemic diseases would hamper the expansion of trade and the development of commerce. Therefore, in retrospect, most nations' responses to epidemics were not born out of historically nationalistic gestures underpinned by a Statist discourse to protect and defend against Westphalian notions of sovereign dignity. Instead, the nations' responses were traditionally based on more rationalistic and interest\u2010based considerations.",

As Norman Howard\u2010Jones observed, the very first international health conferences in the nineteenth century were not motivated by a wish for the general enhancement of the world's health, but by the desire to protect certain favoured (European) nations from contamination by their less favoured (Eastern European) counterparts (Howard\u2010Jones 1975: 10\u201332). Therefore, earlier forms of collaborative action illuminated these politicians' concerns about the impact of outbreaks on their nationals and, in particular, the rationale that underpinned the sense of nationalism behind the ruling elite's orientation towards healthy policy.",

Extrapolating from this, all nations are therefore born \u2018equal\u2019 in this fraternity of nations, as enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations that membership in the UN is \u2018based on the principle of the sovereign equality\u2019. The stark reality is that the members in this community of nations can hardly be equal. We hear of \u2018Great Powers\u2019 all the time, as much as we hear of the influence of the \u2018bi\u2010polar\u2019 or the \u2018uni\u2010polar\u2019 world. The logic that drives and motivates nations in this fraternity today is the quest to become \u2018Great\u2019, and this desire for nationalism underpins most nationalist thinking and discourse within any given state. While there is no definite statistical evidence for this, it would not be an exaggeration to say that most nations wished that they could at least play in the finals of the World Cup. For that matter, Americans beam with pride as the US is consistently regarded as the only superpower left in the World, just as a significant number of Russians look back nostalgically with pride to a glorious past. The French are convinced that they are the most superior civilisation and culture left in the world, and point to the vibrancy and the romance of their capital, Paris, and the French dominance in luxury and designer goods industry. It is also quite clear that the Chinese are extremely proud of their economic rise and perceive the hosting of the 2008 Olympic Games as a sign that it has made it in the world. In short, nations thrive on pride and sovereign dignity.",

            "text": "Most nations regard themselves as \u2018strong\u2019, founded on science, rationality, and progress. This vocabulary is found not only in discourse pertaining to health but also politics and economics. A healthy nation is strong, resilient, and able to withstand any political, economic, or health crisis. In 1832, the French medical community thought that the disease creating havoc in the Eastern Mediterranean would never affect France, expecting that it be confined to weaker and less civilised populations experiencing a poor and unhealthy climate. The cholera killed 15,000 people in four days in Paris (Delaporte 1986), thus confounding most of the elites. Today when political leaders speak of a healthy nation, they more often use \u2018health\u2019 as an analogy to draw comparisons, alluding to their aspirations for the country to be strong in all dimensions. The \u2018health\u2019 of a nation is therefore founded on both symbolic and substantive terms, and they are often intertwined in reality. In symbolic terms, a \u2018sick\u2019 nation is one that is weak. Tsar Nicholas I described the crumbling Ottoman Empire as the \u2018sick man of Europe\u2019, just as Russia has been tagged with the same label in the last two decades after the demise of the Soviet Union. In Asia, one saw the Japanese labelling the decaying Qing China the \u2018sick man of East Asia\u2019. Qing China was not only weak economically, militarily, and politically, but was also plagued by internal stifle, unrest, and opium addiction. The most potent symbol of this \u2018sick man of East Asia\u2019 was the imagery of Chinese men hooked on opium, a drug introduced by the British to reduce its trade deficit as its demand for Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain increased. This imagery has underpinned various versions of Chinese nationalism ever since.",

One of the most important dimensions is China's obsession with sovereignty or perceived infringements of her sovereignty or pride. This has made China hypersensitive to any sort of international criticism, it as an infringement of her sovereignty or meddling in her internal affairs. Obviously one could argue that this is a political strategy of the CPC to deflect any sort of political challenge, but given the rise of nationalism within China over the last decade, one cannot help but realise that these sentiments might be more widespread than conceived.",

Despite all the changes that the country has undergone, the traditional so\u2010called \u2018face\u2010saving\u2019 approach seemed to be as intact as ever and even deeply engrained in the mentality of the Chinese leadership. Therefore, when there is an event that could damage national pride, it is highly embarrassing for them to admit. The best way to resolve the troublesome event is to actively avoid or deny. Thus the mode of dealing with national calamity is to identify a problem before the outside world discovers it, take measures to address it, and only afterwards report the improved situation. These mechanics have been generally at the heart of the Chinese leadership's crisis management, particularly with regard to emerging infectious diseases. This was evident in China's response to SARS.",

This figure is lower than the previously published estimate of 840,000 in 2003. However, the actual number of AIDS carriers is believed to be much greater. The inaccuracy of the estimate is due to the fact that there is massive underreporting of the disease, especially the rural areas. There are many reasons for underreporting, but a shortage of adequate resources and a lack of openness in confronting the epidemic at many levels of government (provincial and local levels) are some of the major factors that contribute to China's slow response.

Emerging infectious diseases, in particular, have triggered the political aspect of public health because the threat of the trans\u2010border spread of disease challenges the traditional state\u2010centric approach to infectious disease policy. The pathogenic threats highlight the inability of states to act alone to prevent the spread of infectious diseases amid globalisation. As a consequence, emerging infectious diseases have forced a reconceptualisation of public health governance both nationally and globally, leading to an increase in the process of global collaboration. The concept of global health governance has therefore emerged in this context, characterised by the relative decline in the salience of states alone and the increased involvement of new ways of norm setting and compliance processes. The question that this article considers is whether nations and national dignity have been virtually impacted and eventually weakened by the new health governance mechanism which is able to set and control the rules of health at a global level. It is argued that global health governance may influence the nation's response to the threats posed by emerging infectious diseases such as SARS or AIDS as a mode of building political compromises but does not considerably alter the nation's behaviour, at least for China. It is argued that in case of China, sovereign dignity and nationalism outweighed the global values in the response to infectious diseases.",

In addition, the Chinese leadership's obsession with issues of national security further allowed the SARS virus to spread across the world. No one could disclose information about the epidemic unless they had security clearance, because sharing information pertaining to or even acknowledging the existence of any infectious disease is regarded as a crime by revealing \u2018state secrets\u2019.

This would undoubtedly further damage China's national pride and dignity by announcing to the world that China was not able to deal with domestic public health problems.

With the help of international health expertise, China was able to successfully curb the SARS epidemic in a very short period and with remarkable efficiency. Its successful efforts somewhat ameliorated the embarrassment it caused itself by the bungled handling of the disease outbreak, and to a certain extent restored some of its lost national pride and international reputation.

Indeed, the incidents surrounding reporting of avian influenza in China clearly demonstrate how the Chinese government has hindered progress towards halting the epidemic, denied the presence of an outbreak, prevented the exchange of information on the flu virus, and allegedly promoted widespread misuse of antiviral vaccination in chickens. Scientists were often faced by less than cooperative local and central officials, whose primary concern was how health problems would negatively impact on national development goals.
