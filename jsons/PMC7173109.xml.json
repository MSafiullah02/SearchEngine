            "text": "Viral respiratory infections are commonly known to accompany or precede acute otitis media and the significance of viral\u2013bacterial interactions in the development of clinical AOM is generally accepted. Different pathogenetic mechanisms for these interactions have been suggested and they supposedly act together in a complicated manner depending on the immune status and genetic background of the host in addition to the properties of the microbes involved. We hypothesized that a given virus group or species might facilitate growth of a certain bacterial species in the middle ear, for instance, by inducing a cytokine response causing a specific pattern of inflammation in the nasopharynx, which would then favour one bacterial species more than another. This situation could be presented as a specific association between the indicated virus group and the benefited bacterial species. Our failure to detect any such association should not be taken as evidence for that such a situation could not exist, because several features in our set up might have prevented us from seeing it. Firstly, our microbiological data were limited to a single sampling time determined by the child's presentation at the study clinic after a varying length of AOM symptoms, while the associated viral infection had persisted most likely for several days already. As a consequence, we may have missed some relevant viruses. Secondly, for a bacterial species to be detected in the MEF during AOM, it is required that the patient is carrying the bacterium in the nasopharynx before the onset of AOM. No relevant bacterial carriage data were available for these patients but it is obvious that every child was not carrying every bacterial pathogen constantly. This might be one reason for the observed variation in the distribution of the bacterial species in different datasets representing a single study. For instance, the sample of AOM events of the Vaccine Trial analysed in this study showed relatively more S. pneumoniae than larger materials of the same study analysed before.18, 19 Thirdly, in spite of using sensitive techniques to detect the different viruses in the samples, both biological and technical factors may have resulted in missing some infections caused by the virus groups tested for. The quantities and the lengths of excretion are likely to vary depending on both the virus species and the host individual. Likewise, the detection sensitivities of the tests\u2014even if exploiting the same principle\u2014usually vary from virus to virus.",

Testing for them might have increased the proportion of AOM events with documented coninciding defined virus infection, but we do not believe that it would have changed the main results of this study because the tested viruses covered two thirds of all AOM events, with or without MEF cultures positive for bacterial pathogens. Under these conditions, it is obvious that only very strong interactions would become apparent and our negative results for specific virus\u2013bacterial associations in AOM should be valued accordingly.",

Only the occurrences of rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and RSV were analysed because the numbers of all other detected viruses were so small that random effects caused confusing, and most likely false segregations. This is exemplified in Table 4 where in the Cohort Study, pneumococci appear to associate with virus mixture much more often than with any single virus, whereas in the Vaccine Trial the opposite is true and here instead M. catarrhalis is specifically associated with virus mixture. Epidemiological studies indicate that occurrence of AOM is strictly associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections. In the prospective Cohort Study, about 40% of URI in young children were found to result in AOM.5 In this study, we decided to compare the aetiology of URI, whether based on virus detection in NPA or MEF, with the bacterial MEF culture result, rather than relying on the MEF results only for both microbial classes. In these two studies, the overall rate of virus detection in the MEF was about two thirds of that in the NPA and the virus found in the MEF was also detected in the NPA specimen in about 60 and 80%, respectively, of the MEF positive events.6 We also made the cross-tabulations of the MEF results only (not shown) and found that, possibly due to smaller numbers of events, random variation appeared to cause some trends in one study but again, they were not seen in the other, and, therefore, not likely to be true.",

This trend is consistent with the previous concept11 that, as compared with other viral infections, RSV infection is associated with an increased risk for AOM, even without bacteria. Similarly, RSV positive URI episodes were more often associated with AOM than URI due to other viruses5 and, compared with other viruses, a relatively larger proportion of RSV positive NPA specimens was coinciding with RSV positive MEF specimens.6 Enteroviruses, analysed in the Vaccine Trial only, appeared to occur more often with the main bacterial pathogens than without them. This might mean that enteroviruses are not very potential pathogens in the ear by themselves. Alternatively, the result could also suggest that enterovirus infection is relatively efficient in facilitating bacterial invasion into the middle ear.",
