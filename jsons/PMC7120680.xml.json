Regrettably, due to overuse of pharmaceuticals together with their improper disposal, unwanted residues of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been found in different compartments of environment since 1970 [1, 2]. Pharmaceuticals are deliberately designed to have an explicit mechanism of action (MOA) and exercise an effect on specific organs, tissues, or cells in living systems and many of them are persistent in the body [3]. Thus, pharmaceuticals and their unaltered metabolites can affect humans as well as animals when entered into the environment by diverse sources and routes. Also the MOA designed for human could be different for another type of species and even potentially \u201csafe\u201d drugs could have serious effects on them from biological ladder. This feature makes pharmaceuticals unique from other chemicals and this is the one and only reason to assess the potential acute and chronic effects of pharmaceuticals in diverse environmental compartments. It is quite obvious that the toxicity of pharmaceuticals on organisms in aquatic and nonaquatic environment is due to their long persistent and bioaccumulative nature [4]. One of the notable effects is the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to numerous antibiotics due to the overuse of pharmaceuticals in humans and pet animals [5].",

Thus, increasing levels of detected and measured medicine residues in the environment make pharmaceuticals as Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CEC) [8, 9]. Around 600 APIs or their metabolites and transformation products have been found in the environment, specifically in surface water and sewage effluent as well as in ground water and in the soil samples for more than 71 countries all over the world [7, 10]. More than 200 APIs from therapeutic classes of painkillers, vascular drugs, antibiotics, and antidepressants are identified in aquatic and terrestrial compartments in concentration ranging from few ng/L to 1000 \u03bcg/L [11]. Majority of APIs are partially degraded or treated in waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and finally discharged in the aquatic environment [12], leading to a ubiquitous and uninterrupted contamination [13]. A good amount of contaminants are released through improper disposals and excretion through feces and urines into the sewage system [14]. Other significant sources of pharmaceuticals are hospitals and industries, whose effluents are loaded with very high concentration of APIs and their metabolites [15].",

Under nationwide study of \u201cemerging pollutants\u201d in 139 rivers in 30 states of the USA, the US Geological Survey (USGS) detected biologically active compounds of diverse therapeutic classes [17]. The cardiovascular drug propranolol and antiepileptic drugs like carbamazepine and clofibrate have been reported in sewage treatment plants [18, 19]. Commonly used beta blockers (e.g., Metoprolol around 1.54 \u03bcg/L) and beta-sympathomimetics, estrogens (e.g., 17\u03b2-estradiol equal to 0.013 \u03bcg/L) [20], analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., Diclofenac up to 1.2 \u03bcg/L) [21], lipid lowering agents (e.g., clofibrinic acid up to 0.2 \u03bcg/L) [22], and antiepileptic drugs (e.g., Carbamazepine up to 2.1 \u03bcg/L) [21] were detected in major river water. Interestingly, there is strong evidence of nonprescription drugs like cotinine, caffeine, and acetaminophenone in samples of potable water in Atlanta, Georgia [23]. Gemfibrozil and carbamazepine were detected in drinking waters in ten cities in Canada by Tauber [24]. Under sex hormones, estrogens have been detected in plasticizers and preservatives, while 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active component of contraceptive pills, has been identified in groundwater and tap water samples [25].",

The EMEA guidelines for the assessment of potential environmental risks were released in 2006 [26]. According to the US FDA guidelines, applicants have to present an environmental assessment report when the probable concentration of the API in the aquatic environment is \u22651 \u03bcg/L [27]. Previously, the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) issued a guidance document \u2018Guidance for Industry for the Submission of an Environmental Assessment in Human drug Application and Supplements\u2019 in 1995 [28]. Due to the emerging concern of their hazards, directive 2004/27/EC [29, 30] for human medicine and directive 2004/28/EC [31] for veterinary medicine required an Environmental Risk Assessment for marketing authorization of new pharmaceuticals products. The European Union Directive 2013/39/EU [32] included two pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and 17-alpha-ethynilestradiol (EE2)) and a natural hormone (17-beta-estradiol (E2)) in a first watch list of ten substances for the European Union monitoring of water. Furthermore, the watch list was amended in 2015 with directive 2015/495/EU [33], and three macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin), an additional natural hormone (estrone E1), a UV filter (octinoxate), and an antioxidant used as a food additive (butylated hydroxytoluene) were included [34].",

            "text": "The usage of pharmaceuticals is so extensive, and it is expected to intensify due to ageing of population in Europe and the USA, that the risk assessment requires a huge number of experimental data ensuing high costs, high time demand, and animal testing for in vivo testing. Regrettably, the number of available experimental data is very limited. The available data are also limited to specific species and assessed for particular environment compartment. In absence of sufficient experimental data, quantitative structure\u2013activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR /QSTR) approach represents a convincing substitute to predict the possible hazards, from their chemical structure information [35]. Thus, to fill the data gaps, government and nongovernment regulatory authorities suggest the use of in silico methods for prediction of the physicochemical properties, toxicological activity, distribution, fate, etc. of pharmaceuticals along with their effects on environment and living systems much before they enter into market for usage. Therefore, usage of QSAR as one of the nonexperimental methods is noteworthy in order to lessen time, animal usage and cost involvement in toxicity prediction of pharmaceuticals [36, 37]. Persistent and Bioaccumulative (PB) behavior of pharmaceuticals was studied by Howard and Muir [38] employing QSAR models. More than 1200 pharmaceuticals were screened and prioritized for overall Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) potential using the Insubria PBT Index and the US-EPA PBT Profiler by Sangion and Gramatica [39]. The European Union Commission\u2019s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and Environment (CSTEE) had recommended the use of QSAR models for screening purposes of pharmaceutical ingredients [40]. In recent times, a good number of software or expert systems are available for ecotoxicity prediction. A widely used online modeling tool to predict ecotoxicity of chemicals by QSAR is ECOSAR [41, 42].",

            "text": "To understand the ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals, the first step is to identify their sources and entry routes into the environment. Major sources and familiar pathways for environmental pollution of pharmaceuticals are illustrated below.\nHousehold disposal: Due to lack or improper instructions about medication disposal, in many cases expired and unused medicines are dumped through the toilet or via waste bins, before being transferred to landfill sites as terrestrial ecosystem hazards. According to a study, unused medication were found due to modification of drugs by the doctor (48.9%), or self-discontinuation (25.8%), and the study identified that the common approach of disposal was throwing unused drugs in the trash (76.5%) or flushing them down the drain (11.2%) [47].\nIndustrial waste: One of the major sources of API , in-process and quality control failed final materials are generated from pharmaceutical industries. Though industries are following the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), still a large number of evidence is there for significant pharmaceutical emissions from industries. Concentrations up to several mg/L of pharmaceutical wastes have been identified in effluents for single compounds, specifically in Asian countries [48].\nHospital influent and effluent: Hospital influents and effluents are another noteworthy source according to several researches and it is proved that the eradication of the pharmaceuticals is partial. According to a study, 16 pharmaceuticals including antiepileptics and anti-inflammatories were detected in the hospital waste water [49].\nContinuous introduction of diagnostic compounds: Iodinated X-ray contrast media like iomeprol, iohexol, and iopromide are generally employed as diagnostic tools for capturing detailed X-ray images of soft tissues and thereafter eliminated without appropriate treatment which helps in persistence of these wastes for a long period of time in the ecosystem [50].\nHuman excreta: APIs as well as their metabolites are excreted through the human excreta which is another imperative source of pharmaceutical waste. The complexity of risk assessment is increased manifold as the risk of metabolites is entirely dissimilar from the API.\nAquaculture: Sewage treatment plant (STP) sludge is routinely used as fertilizer in agriculture. Along with that, antibiotics have been also employed in aquaculture primarily for therapeutic purposes and as prophylactic agents (erythromycin, oxytetracycline, premix, sarafloxacin, sulfonamides) according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [51].\nManure, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine: Urine and feces of animals in addition to direct application of veterinary medication in aqua farming leads to soil contamination besides contaminating both the surrounding surface and groundwater during rain [52].\nPlant agriculture: Antibiotics like streptomycin with oxytetracycline are very commonly employed in plant agriculture in controlling bacterial diseases of flower and fruits. They are principally used for apple, pear, and related fruit trees for controlling fire blight caused by Erwinia amylovora. Studies have suggested that antibiotics applied to plants account for <0.5% of total antibiotic use in the USA [53].\n",

            "text": "Pharmaceuticals are frequently employed in healthcare, farming, and aquaculture nowadays. The defined daily doses (DDDs) of consumed drugs can be found in the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) homepage [54]. A hefty number of research covering evidence of pharmaceuticals in water bodies, sewage and effluent treatment plant, manure, soil, and air dust have been performed. Pharmaceuticals are multicomponent mixtures rather than isolated pure substances, which will either be transformed by physical and chemical means and/or subsequently biotransformed by microorganisms. Therefore, multi-component mixtures are the primary concerning issue for the ecotoxicity assessment. Another point of concern is that majority of molecules can be neutral, cationic, anionic, or zwitterionic which makes the risk assessment study trickier. Thus, pharmaceuticals are evaluated for their acute toxicity by standard tests following the guidelines of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), US EPA, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) employing standard laboratory endpoints like zooplankton, algae, and other invertebrates and fish. The most toxic and concerning classes were antibiotics, antibacterials, analgesics , cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, and antipsychotics.Antibiotics: Quinolones (mostly ciprofloxacin) have been identified in the hospital effluent up to a low \u03bcg/L range while \u03b2-lactams like carbapenems, monobactams, penicillins, cephalosporins, and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors were detected in the lower \u03bcg/L range in hospital effluent as well as in the influent of a municipal STP [55]. Antibiotics like tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, sarafloxacin, and cyclosporine A are largely found in the ecosystem and the most concerning issue is they have quite slow biodegradability in soil. Chlortetracycline and tetracycline were detected in ten out of 12 soil samples by Hamscher et al. [56]. As antibiotics have the ability to affect the microorganisms in sewage systems and WWTP, the inhibition of wastewater bacteria may critically influence degradation and nitrification process of organic matter [57]. Carucci [58] et al. reported noteworthy inhibition of the nitrification showed by lincomycin. Ciprofloxacin was identified to be active against Vibrio fisheri at a concentration of 5 mg/L [59]. Processes like transcription and translation are largely affected by macrolides, tetracyclines, lincosamides, P-aminoglycosides, and pleuromutilins for plants. Not only this, metabolic pathways like folate biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and chloroplast replication are influenced by sulfonamides, triclosan, and fluoroquinolones, respectively [60]. Along with water bodies, microorganism and plants, antibiotics have the ability to affect the degradation of organic matter of soils and sediments to a large extent. A transitory effect on sulfate reduction was also identified when antibiotics were present in sediment [61]. Chloramphenicol was banned for food-producing animals within the USA and the EU in 1994 as it generated severe hazardous effects including myelosuppression to farmers [62]. In present times, the most significant effect is the surfacing of resistance due to improper and uncontrolled usage of antibiotics as medicine for human and animals as well as animal husbandry. The most well-known examples are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and multiresistant pseudomonads [63].Blood lipid lowering agents: Proliferation of peroxisomes in rodent liver is caused by fibrates and statins which have the ability to suppress synthesis of the juvenile hormone in insects. Additionally, they produce damaging effect to protozoan parasites, inhibiting growth and development. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) and amphibians can be highly affected by fibrates when present even at micromolar concentrations [3]. Quinn et al. [64] categorized bezafibrate as damaging for nontarget organisms with EC50 concentration between 10 and 100 mg/L and gemfibrozil as toxic with EC50 concentration between 1 and 10 mg/L. Fibrates have been evaluated by usual toxicity assays and the following no-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) was detected for clofibric acid in C. dubia is NOEC (7 days) = 640 \u03bcg/L, for the rotifer B. Calyciflorus is NOEC (2 days) = 246 \u03bcg/L, and in early life stages of zebrafish is NOEC (10 days) = 70 mg/L [65]. Clofibrate is harmful to aquatic organisms with LC50 values of 7.7\u201339.7 mg/L. The most sensitive organism toward clofibrate is the fish Gambusia holbrooki [LC50 (96 h) = 7.7 mg/L]. Misra et al. [66] reported that clofibrate has no effect on in vitro growth of T. bruceii but reduces the incidence of P. berghei and the invasiveness as well as development of Acanthomoeba culbertsoni in exposed mammalian hosts.Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs have been detected in higher concentrations especially in surface water, ranging between 0.4 ng/L and 15 \u03bcg/L. Among NSAIDs, paracetamol, diclofenac, and ibuprofen are the most quantitatively found [67]. Cleuvers [68] checked that acute toxicities of NSAIDs were moderately low with concentration (EC50) attained in Daphnia in the range from 68 to 166 mg/L and from 72 to 626 mg/L in case of algae. Observed EC50 values for chronic toxicity are 23.8 mg/L, 23.6 mg/L, and 38.2 mg/L for diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, respectively in surface water. The NASIDs can reach in the environment with concentrations up to >1 \u03bcg/L due to their extensive usage and required pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Among NSAIDs, diclofenac has the highest acute toxicity with the effective concentrations below 100 mg/L and frequently detected in wastewater at a median concentration of 0.81 \u03bcg/L, whereas the maximal concentration in wastewater and surface water is up to 2 \u03bcg/L [69]. Acetylsalicylic acid affected reproduction in D. longispina and D. magna at concentrations of 1.8 mg/L [69]. Another frequently prescribed NSAID is paracetamol which is present in surface waters with concentration of 78.17 \u03bcg/L and within the range of 20 ng/L to 4.3 \u03bcg/L in STP effluents. The detected concentrations are higher than the stipulated no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 9.2 \u03bcg/L [3].Beta-blockers: Propranolol showed the highest acute toxicity and log K\now supporting the fact that it is one of the strongest membrane stabilizers among the examined beta-blockers by Huggett et al. [70]. The NOEC and lowest-observed-effect-concentration (LOEC) of propranolol affecting reproduction in C. dubia were 125 and 250 \u03bcg/L. In case of H. azteca, reproduction affected after 27 days of exposure in at 100 \u03bcg/L [70]. In aquatic compartment, propranolol negatively affects survival, swimming behavior, and phototaxis of free-living aquatic stages of trematodes. Fathead minnows exposed to atenolol throughout embryo\u2013larval growth showed LOEC and NOEC values for growth rate of 10 mg/L and 3.2 mg/L, respectively [3]. With 48-h exposure to propranolol, LC50 values of 1.6 mg/L, 29.8 mg/L, and 0.8 mg/L were obtained for D. magna, H. azteca, and C. dubia respectively, while acute exposure to nadolol did not affect the survival of the invertebrates [3]. Encystment of the protozoan Entamoeba invadens was inhibited in the presence of metoprolol [71].Anticancer drugs: These are one of the most toxic therapeutic classes, designed to kill the cancer cells. They possess genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and fetotoxic properties. One of the interesting points is that 14\u201353% of the drugs can be excreted in unaltered form through urine and feces, making them lethal for aquatic, soil organisms as well as for living systems and ecosystems [72]. Methotrexate has been reported to show acute effects in the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis with an EC50 of 45 mg/L and teratogenicity for fish embryos with an EC50 of 85 mg/L after 48 h of exposure in both cases [73]. Cyclophosphamide and methotrexate demonstrated immunosuppressant property to cause a proliferation in disease incidence and intensity in host\u2013parasite systems [74]. Highly proliferative species like the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis showed acute toxicity to methotrexate with concentration of EC50 (48 h) = 45 mg/L [75]. Surprisingly, Methotrexate has no or little effect on definite protozoans like Babesia bovis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Leishmania tropica, as these organisms have dissimilar mechanisms of drug metabolism [76]. Again, cyclophosphamide emerges to have a minute effect on them. Development and growth of helminths in mammalian and bird hosts were destructively effected by cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. Abnormal teratogenicity was observed in fish embryos at higher concentrations of methotrexate [EC50 (48 h) = 85 mg/L] [76].CNS affecting drugs: Fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is one of the acute toxic pharmaceuticals with toxicity ranging from EC50 (48 h, alga) = 0.024 mg/L to LC50 (48 h) = 2 mg/L [18]. Sertraline demonstrated highly toxic response to rainbow trout (LC50 of 0.38 mg/L) at a 96-h exposure [77]. SSRIs showed growth inhibitions for algae and chronic toxicity tests confirmed they were sensitive with NOEC values below 1 mg/L [78]. On the contrary, organism like C. vulgaris was identified to be the least sensitive species for all SSRIs tested. Fluvoxamine showed a rise to the highest EC50 values for all algae species tested with concentration range between 3563 and 10,208 \u03bcg/L. Nitrazepam, benzodiazepines, and diazepam were recognized to amplify the number of microfilariae of Setavia cervi liberated from the lungs into the peripheral blood circulation in rats [79]. Caffeine was identified to stimulate the growth of P. falciparum and P. gallinaceum, while the mood stabilizer valproic acid and the antipsychotic haloperidol efficiently inhibited the in vitro growth of T. gondii [80]. Antiepileptics like carbamazepine and diazepam were categorized as potentially harmful to aquatic organisms as majority of the acute toxicity data was below 100 mg/L [65].Sex hormones: These are one of the significant therapeutic classes emerged as the most serious aquatic environmental hazards due to their widespread use as human contraceptives. A synthetic estrogen named Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is generally found in oral contraceptive pills with evident estrogenic effects in fish. The EE2 concentrations below 1 ng/L creates striking effects in fertilization process, egg production and decreased expression of secondary male sex characteristics to fathead minnows. Lifelong contact of zebrafish to EE2 (with concentration of 5 ng/L) has led to reproductive failure due to the nonexistence of secondary male sex characteristics [81]. Exposure to 17\u03b2-estradiol caused an increased susceptibility to the protozoan T. gondii in mice, while increased pathology occurred in mammals infected with Leishmania mexicana amazonensis and exposed to either estradiol or testosterone [82]. Estradiol increased the vulnerability of cyprinids to hemoflagellates by the repression of lymphocyte proliferation [83]. Hydrocortisone can increase the intensity of ectoparasitic infections in fish at reasonably high concentrations. The detected concentrations of estrogenic products are typically below 50 ng/L in the effluent of STP and WWTP. On the contrary, high concentrations of 17\u03b1-estradiol and estriol (about 180 ng/L and 590 ng/L, respectively) were found in the USA [84].Antiparasitic compounds: Antiparasitic compounds doramectin and ivermectin, with concentration of 0.112 mg/kg and 1.85 mg/kg, respectively were detected in dung of a farmhouse in the UK [85]. Interestingly, the concentrations of these drugs in soil were noticeably lower up to 0.046 mg/kg for the same farm [85]. Gr\u00f8nvold et al. [86] found that fenbendazole and ivermectin affect the endurance of the nematode Pristionchus maupasi at concentrations of 10\u201320 mg/kg and higher than 3 mg/kg, respectively. Svendsen et al. [87] reported that fenbendazole and ivermectin did not affect earthworms; however, the disappearance in dung was affected by the avermectin but not by the fenbendazole. Sun et al. [88] detected avermectin B1A in soil with the compost worm Eisenia fetida at a concentration of 17.1 mg/kg (LC50).Antivirals: The emergence of Relenzas (zanamivir) and Tamiflu, neuraminidase inhibitors, in the USA began after the influenza pandemic (H1N1) in 2009 [89]. Tamiflu overpowered Relenza due to its relative ease of administration. Tamiflu, a prodrug form, is converted to the active molecule oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) in the liver. Generally, 80% of an oral dose of Tamiflu is excreted as OC through urine and the remaining fractions are excreted as oseltamivir ethylester-phosphate (OP) in the feces. Thus, both the API and its active metabolite ultimately are projected to attain a mean of 2\u201312 mg/L in WWTPs during moderate and severe pandemics, respectively [89]. The OC concentrations ranging from 293 to 480 ng/L have been reported in river waters charged with WWTP effluents during the 2009 pandemic [90].\n",

The USA has spent around $2.5 billion for the disposal of medical waste in 2012. Interestingly, with annual growth of 4.8%, by 2017, the increased cost is expected to $3.2 billion [91]. For instance, just hospitals in the USA produce more than 5.9 million tons of waste annually. Therefore, one can imagine the level of hazardous intensity generated by medical waste all over the world as all healthcare activities considered to humans generated medical wastes. The danger increased to manifold by mishandling or improper disposal of these medical wastes. Therefore, persons engaged to proper risk assessment and management must be aware with types of medical wastes especially pharmaceutical ones along with different approaches to treat them efficiently to minimize the hazards to environment and living systems. A typical list of pharmaceutical hazardous waste with few examples is illustrated in Fig. 2 and most commonly employed treatment for pharmaceutical as well as medical waste to avoid high risk of ecotoxicity is reported in Fig. 3.\n\n",

Thus to set up the 3Rs concept, in silico techniques are one of the best options available. The European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) was established in the year 1991 that agrees with the principle of 3Rs.The ban of animal experimentation by regulatory agencies and government organizations initiated the need of molecular modeling approach [111].

In silico prediction has the proficiency to help out in the prioritization of pharmaceuticals for testing, and for predicting ecotoxicity to allow for classification. Computer models are a reliable source for toxicity predictions as they can be used as one of the significant sources for filling the missing data of ecotoxicity.Understanding the real mechanism of action for each pharmaceutical for specific endpoints and environment compartment system. For many modeling approaches, it may be assumed that molecules fitting the similar QSAR models are acting by the same MOA [114].Cost and time saving are two major reasons for the use of in silico approaches. Even a simple ecotoxicological assay may cost several thousand dollars. On the contrary, early toxicity prediction can save a good amount of time and money [115].

Apart from studies on individual pharmaceuticals, the need of risk assessment and management of their metabolites and mixture of pharmaceuticals are discussed. The role of government authorities and different policies regulated regarding identification of risk assessment and management must be implemented in a proper way with right direction. Conversely, insufficient ecotoxicity data related to a definite class of pharmaceuticals has slowed down the computational modeling to some point. So, properly documented database is the need of the hour for environmentalists. On the contrary, though a good number of in silico models, especially QSAR models are reported for toxicity prediction of chemicals hazards, but a few successful models exist for pharmaceutical hazards. Thus, ample number of models should be generated to get the ecotoxicity data for pharmaceuticals for diverse endpoints and environmental compartments. Expert systems have the ability to make fast and reliable predictions with a single click of mouse, which urges to develop more expert systems for a set of endpoints. There is no doubt that in silico methods cannot completely substitute experimental approaches, but they can be integrated for better understanding and quantification of pharmaceuticals\u2019 ecotoxicity.",
