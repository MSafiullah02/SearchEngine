Based on viral gene sequence analysis, hMPV belongs to Metapneumovirus genus, Paramyxoviridae family, and Pneumovirinae subfamily.1, 2 Global epidemiological surveys showed that hMPV is prevalent worldwide with severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia.3 The morbidity of hMPV infection varies from 3% to 14.3% and the predominate strain is subtype A.4, 5, 6, 7 The susceptible populations of hMPV are infants, young children, immunocompromised individuals, and elderly people.8, 9, 10 Children under 5 years old have almost been infected by hMPV. Recently, respiratory problems caused by hMPV became more and more obvious and cannot be neglected anymore. hMPV could cause lethal infection in posttransplant patients and bring more serious consequences when host coinfected with other virus.11, 12 However, to date, there is no effective vaccine for prevention from hMPV infection.",

Then downstream signaling cascades are activated and endocytic internalization is promoted. Finally, virus particle could be endocytosed as an intact form and transported to specific organelles through vesicles. According to different vectors, the main four kinds of endocytic pathways are defined, such as clathrin\u2010, caveolae\u2010, cholesterol\u2010mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis.16 Recently, hMPV had been found to invade BEAS\u20102B cells via endocytosis17 and in our previous studies, we also found that hMPV uses endocytosis pathway in Vero E6 and LLC\u2010MK2 cell lines.18\n",

But endocytosis way was discovered during viral entry of many enveloped viruses (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus).26 For all enveloped viruses, the viral membrane must fuse with cellular membrane or organelle membrane to accomplish infection.

These structures are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. This microdomain usually takes emigrant molecules from extracellular microenvironment to intracellular region, so it is named lipid raft.29 Lipid raft plays a critical role in signal transduction and protein trafficking. It is also important to establish cell polarity.19, 20 In this study, we focused on the effect of lipid raft on virus cell entry. Lipid raft is a specialized membrane microdomain that contains glycosphingolipids and lipoglycoproteins. It is rich in cholesterol, the content of cholesterol in lipid raft is about three to five fold compared with other structure in the cellular membrane. Cholesterol is the key element to maintain lipid raft to keep intact form, so cholesterol depletion could destroy lipid rafts on the surface of cell membrane. Lipid rafts are thought to be involved in the process of HIV invasion of macrophages cells because of cholesterol depletion by M\u03b2CD could reduce the infection of HIV, and HIV receptors were found at detergent\u2010resistant membranes (DRMs).21 Lipid rafts are important to influenza virus assembly and budding.30 The study of influenza virus found that transmembrane glycoprotein, hemagglutinin, and neuronal ammonia were abundant in the DRMs in the process of influenza virus translation. Besides, influenza virus nucleoprotein could target specifically the apical surface. Because lipid rafts play an important role in virus entry, assembly, and budding, so we have tried to explore the role of lipid rafts in the process of hMPV cell entry.",

The colocalization of CTB and hMPV was universal in 16HBE cells, and the colocalization number increased gradually. Morphological research showed a dynamic process of hMPV cell entry. At first, only little colocating points were found at 0 minute, and then some colocating points were concentrated on the surface of cell membrane at 30 minutes. At last, most of these colocating points appear at the site away from the cell membrane at 60 and 120 minutes, hMPV colocalized with lipid rafts moved gradually toward the nucleus with the lipid rafts.
