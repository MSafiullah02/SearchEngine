The tachypnea being more pronounced in calves receiving hypertonic bicarbonate than saline is most likely because of the hypercapnia (Table 4). In study II (NaHCO3), several calves with only slight metabolic acidosis were treated, which did not require buffer capacity at all. Nevertheless, also these patients had had no problem in coping with the application of hypertonic bicarbonate by enhancing ventilation. Even newborn calves with mixed respiratory acidosis because of dystocia (mean blood pH 7.06) were successfully treated by infusion of on average 270 mL sodium bicarbonate solution (5%) over 15 minutes, combined with doxapram IV and intranasal oxygen insufflation\n29\n; no negative effects compared with calves treated with carbicarb were found. Also, rapid IV administration of HBS (8.4%; 5 mL/kg over 5 minutes) was found to be effective and safe for treating strong ion acidosis in normovolemic calves with experimentally induced respiratory and strong ion acidosis.\n19\n In these 2 studies, however, lower amounts of bicarbonate were infused than in study II presented here. Many calves, especially with a longer history of diarrhea, also suffer from respiratory infections. It remains unknown whether removal of excessive CO2 after application of HBS by hyperventilation is possible in such patients. Reports of practitioners about sudden fatalities in calves after hypertonic bicarbonate infusion may be an indication that such incidents could be related to respiratory insufficiencies. At present, it is recommended to avoid the application of hypertonic bicarbonate in calves suffering from severe respiratory disease, whereas hypertonic saline can also be applied in such patients.2Especially in patients with an impaired ability to remove carbon dioxide, a PIA after rapid injection of large quantities of bicarbonate has been discussed as a matter of concern.\n30\n Accordingly, bicarbonate ions react with H+ ions to form CO2, which readily enters cells and overwhelms the blood\u2010brain barrier because of its high solubility. Thus, the intracellular PCO2 increases, which induces a local respiratory acidosis. The clinical consequences are unclear; it has been postulated that an acidification of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may exaggerate a depression and increase the respiratory rate.\n31\n A PIA has been demonstrated in in vitro studies after increasing the extracellular PCO2 by approximately 70 mmHg.\n30\n, \n32\n However, in vivo the PCO2 rarely increases more than 15 mmHg. It has been suggested that the increase of PCO2 after bicarbonate application can be aggravated by the concomitant release of protons from extracellular nonbicarbonate buffers in severely acidotic patients.\n30\n Berchtold et al\n19\n induced experimentally a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis in calves and found, after subsequent injection of bicarbonate solution (8.4%, 5 mL/kg BW over 5 minutes), no pH change in the CSF irrespective of a transient increase of arterial PCO2 from 81 to 93 mmHg. A turnover rate of CO2 into the CSF of 0.01 minute\u22121 was calculated. In our patients, a statistical trend (P= .08) was found for the relation between plasma pH before injection of hypertonic bicarbonate and the increase of venous PCO2 after injection (Table 4). However, PCO2 increased only by on average 17 mmHg directly after the initial treatment. Thus, PIA seems not to be a reason for profound problems after hypertonic bicarbonate application in calves with a healthy respiratory tract.3Concerns were expressed with respect to IV treatment of diarrheic calves with bicarbonate solutions because the concomitant hypercapnia and removal of metabolic acidosis may worsen the oxygen extraction in peripheral tissues of such patients.\n33\n Based on the results presented here, these concerns seem to be inappropriate despite an extensive transient metabolic alkalosis immediately after injection of HBS (Table 4), which can be explained by incomplete distribution of bicarbonate in the extracellular space. The general condition of most calves that received bicarbonate solution improved rapidly\u2014presumably, the improved blood flow because of increased plasma volume overwhelms the negative impact of a left shift of the oxygen equilibrium curve.\n",
