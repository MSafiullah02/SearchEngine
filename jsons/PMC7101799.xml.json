The frequency of recurrent infection is high regardless of age, and patients with immunodeficiency are at highest risk of fatal complications. Several reports have suggested that the prognosis of RSV disease in hematological malignancies is poor [5\u20139]. It has been reported that the mortality rate was high among infants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) AML-05 study, and one of the causes was respiratory complication caused by RSV infection [10]. Because RSV-specific therapy is not yet established, progression of RSV-induced URTI to LRTI is associated with high mortality [6, 9]. A recent study of high-risk pediatric patients, including those with malignancies, noted 12.5 % mortality rate following RSV infections [6, 11].",

            "text": "Effective treatment for RSV infection has not been established yet [6, 7, 13, 14]. Although efficacy has not been confirmed, steroids are often used to manage RSV infection. In our study, steroids were used in seven patients with progressive LRTI, although symptoms were not improved in any of these patients. Moreover, steroid pulse therapy was administered in four of these patients, and three of them died. Although many institutions used intravenous immunoglobulin therapy aiming an antiviral effect, no obvious effect could be seen in our series. Use of palivizumab, anti-RSV humanized monoclonal antibody, is established for preventing severe RSV infections for young children with congenital heart disease, with history of premature infancy, and/or with history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the current study, no patients underwent prophylaxis with palivizumab, but four patients received palivizumab for treatment after developing severe respiratory failure, and symptoms improved in two of them. This finding suggests the effect of palivizumab as a potential treatment choice and warrants for evaluation in future studies. As of anti-viral agents, aerosolized ribavirin therapy has been used for high-risk patients, but this formula is generally not available in Japan [15\u201318]. Moreover, ribavirin has shown poor efficacy when used as monotherapy. Some reports have suggested that ribavirin is effective in preventing the progression of LRTI when combined with high-titer immunoglobulin, palivizumab, or other treatment options during the URTI period. Further investigation is necessary since the number of patients reported in each study is small [15\u201318]. In our study, aerosolized ribavirin and intramuscular palivizumab were used after progression to LRTI in one patient (Patient #11), but unfortunately did not work. To summarize, there are no established effective treatment for RSV infections to date, and more effective anti-viral therapy for RSV is urgently required for these high-risk cases.",

            "text": "Because RSV only causes mild symptoms when infected in healthy individuals including families or health care providers, it is quite difficult to completely prevent RSV transmission to the patient. Therefore, it is important to immunize the patients themselves to protect them from RSV. Since August 2013, prophylactic administration of palivizumab has been expanded for use in patients younger than 2 years with immunodeficiency in Japan, including patients with malignancies [7]. It is expected that this expansion of palivizumab indication would effectively prevent severe RSV infection in Japanese patients with hematological malignancies, although its efficacy must be further evaluated. However, as many of the cases suffer from RSV infections before or during the initial induction course as shown in the present study, prophylactic palivizumab might not be in time for effective prevention if the patients are already exposed to RSV shortly before or at diagnosis. In that sense, universal vaccination of RSV, which is currently underway, would be more effective.",
