A norm spells out how members of a group believe each other should act. It may or may not be explicitly codified, but members of a community understand the standards expected by the norm and hold each other accountable for conducting themselves in a manner consistent with it. It both constrains and enables action by defining the boundaries of acceptable behaviour (Klotz 1995: 25\u20137). For example, the norm of sovereignty posits that one state does not have the right to interfere or intervene in the affairs of another state. States share an understanding that following the norm of sovereignty is appropriate behaviour for members of the international community, and those who violate the norm face possible sanctioning. Such behavioural expectations are not always formalized by international law or treaties, though they may eventually be; rather, they operate most prominently as a shared social expectation. This social aspect is crucial, since norms can and will change as shared understandings change. To return to the sovereignty example, the behavioural expectations that go along with it today are radically different than those from previous eras (Hall 1999), and continue to evolve today (Wheeler 2000; Finnemore 2003).",

Because of this, norm entrepreneurs have started to recognize the utility of targeting these groups as well. These non-state actors may have financial resources beyond those available to states.

The 1960s and 1970s saw a great wave of decolonization and liberation throughout the Third World, and new governments often came to power promising better health care for all their citizens. While initially many of these new governments took steps to improve health care, often with the support and aid of Western states, services tended to be overly concentrated in urban areas and failed to reach rural areas. This meant that the majority of the population in many newly independent states still had limited access to health care facilities (Hall and Taylor 2003). At the same time, an increasing number of studies criticized the idea that improved health in developing states was simply a matter of transferring Western technologies and health care systems to new places. These studies called for a more holistic approach to health care that emphasized integrating health care into overall social development (Cueto 2004: 1864\u20135). Researchers and activists increasingly called for a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach to health care that focused on local needs and ensuring equitable access without an emphasis on large hospitals or expensive technologies (Magnussen et al. 2004: 168). China, Tanzania, and Venezuela successfully trained local personnel to provide essential basic health care programmes. These programmes offered basic yet comprehensive health care services to rural areas. For example, China's \u2018barefoot doctors\u2019 focused their energies on preventative care within the communities from which they were drawn and combined Western and traditional cures for treatment (Cueto 2004: 1865).",

The IHR sought to \u2018ensure the maximum protection against the international spread of disease with minimum interference with world traffic\u2019 (World Health Organization 1983). States were required to report outbreaks of and take measures to prevent the spread of yellow fever, cholera, and plague \u2014 three diseases whose spread had long been associated with trade and travel (Fidler and Gostin 2006: 86).

They also framed universal primary health care as a public good \u2014 one that required more generalized economic and social development. According to the norm entrepreneurs, the market could not adequately provide primary health care, so the state should do so (Gostin 2000: 4).

Universal primary health care was a public good that developed states should provide in conjunction with developing states out of a sense of moral obligation and fairness and in the spirit of decolonization.",

Critics countered that blaming developed states for the lack of development in poorer states was misplaced.

They called on developed states to provide a large outlay of funds to developing states en masse to right a perceived wrong. These pleas arose as the international community was dealing with a global recession, higher oil prices, and great economic uncertainty. Few, if any, developed states were inclined to increase their foreign aid budgets. If anything, they were less inclined to provide assistance for health care in developing countries (People's Health Movement et al., 2005: 59\u201360). Further, as part of providing this collective public good, developed states were being asked to allow developing states to independently determine their health care policies (Hall and Taylor 2003). The frame for universal primary health care combined large financial outlays with little oversight, making it rather unpalatable to many developed states.",

Norm entrepreneurs argued for universal primary health care as an element of a fundamental right to health at a time when the right to health was highly contested. Their arguments that universal primary health care fit with a broader context of decolonization and fairness failed to find a perch. In the same way that the NIEO largely failed to resonate and led to little but token actions, universal primary health care put forward an idealistic vision that did not resonate with broader trends in the international community at the time. Additionally, conceptualizing health as a collective public good with a prominent role for national governments to provide services ran counter to the increasingly prominent rhetoric of neoliberalism and privatization that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Thomas and Weber 2004). US State Department officials also derided universal primary health care as \u2018too political\u2019 and feared how it could potentially alter the balance between themselves and the Soviet Union (Werner 2001). When Director-General Mahler called the Soviet Union \u2018a pioneer since the first days of its Revolution more than 50 years ago in placing health in the forefront of social goals and in linking its attainment with social justice and economic development\u2019 in his opening remarks at Alma-Ata (Heyward 1978), government officials in some states feared the relationship between universal primary health care and communism. Murphy notes, \u2018American policy makers held that on fundamentals northern and southern views were incompatible\u2026They did not want to debate until both north and south had a single view of their common interests\u2019 (Murphy 1984: 126). Interestingly, while American officials worried about how the ideological content of universal primary health care could promote communism and Soviet ideals, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China vigorously disagreed with each other about the nature of universal primary health care (Cueto 2004). The disagreements between the two leading communist states further undermined universal primary health care's ability to find state supporters.",

Universal primary health care's supporters targeted their appeals toward state governments, believing them to be the key to this norm being embraced by the international community. Many were delegates to the Alma-Ata Conference. Most were bureaucrats either within their national health ministries or the World Health Organization. They may have had the technical expertise to understand the important of universal primary health care and perhaps the experience to implement it, but they lacked the political sway within governments to get them to reassess their behaviours and identities. In other words, they may have been norm entrepreneurs, but they were poorly placed norm entrepreneurs who lacked the ability to persuade enough others to adopt the norm. Health ministries unfortunately have a tendency to be political backwaters with little influence beyond technical matters (Vaughan et al. 1985). The World Health Organization also lacked the stature to significantly affect international debates over universal primary health care. It lacked significant financial resources and, despite a near-universal membership, its political clout among member-states was negligible. The World Health Organization's low status was largely a reflection of the relatively low priority afforded to health within the international community. Most states considered health to be a national responsibility and envisioned a limited role for the international community. The World Health Organization also sought, for much of its history, to consciously avoid political battles so as to avoid antagonizing its members (Godlee 1994). When it did try to take a more assertive role with universal primary health care, it faced the very real threat of having states like the United States withdraw its funding (Walt 1993).",

That year, UNAIDS estimated that six million HIV-positive people in the Third World required ARVs, but less than eight per cent actually received them. While 84 per cent of those in need in Central and South America had access to ARVs, only two per cent of those in Africa, the continent hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic, did (World Health Organization/UNAIDS 2003: 4\u20135). This new programme sought to correct that. It pledged to provide a sustainable and reliable supply of ARVs to three million people in the developing world, half the number who needed the drug, by the end of 2005. Although the leaders of this effort acknowledged that it was an incredibly ambitious goal, they based their calculations on an article published in 2001 in Science. The article's authors cautioned that reaching this target would require optimal levels of both financing and technical capabilities. Still, they considered it doable (Schwartl\u00e4nder et al. 2001) \u2014 as did, apparently, WHO and UNAIDS. WHO and UNAIDS declared the lack of ARV access to be a global health emergency and an issue that urgently needed to be addressed.",

When announcing the new programme, WHO estimated that it would cost at least US$5.5 billion to achieve the target (World Health Organization/UNAIDS 2003: 24). However, the focus was not on the cost, it was on the realization of the norms of respect for universal human rights. WHO also saw the Initiative as promoting the UN's human rights agenda in two ways. First, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that all people have the right to the highest possible standard of health \u2014 a promise reaffirmed to explicitly include HIV/AIDS during the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in 2001. Second, the Initiative pledged to pay special attention to vulnerable groups who may have limited access to treatment and prevention programmes. By emphasizing equity, the Initiative sought to overcome economic barriers that had prevented most people in developing nations from being able to afford ARVs. It utilized the ideas of access to essential medicines and non-discrimination in the provision of care evident in the Alma-Ata Declaration. Harris and Siplon identified a growing recognition, by developed states, of a norm promoting international assistance to developing states as \u2018the right thing to do\u2019 (2006: 263). In their paper, Schw\u00e4rtlander et al. referenced the movement for realizing the right to health in Africa as emblematic of the international community's growing respect for this ideal (2001: 2436). The 3 \u00d7 5 Initiative's own materials were even more explicit. On its website, the Initiative proclaimed that its efforts were \u2018a step towards the GOAL [sic] of making universal access of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment accessible for all who need them as a human right\u2019 (World Health Organization n.d. a; emphasis added). From the earliest days, activists and organizations connected the drive for universal ARV access back to the earlier efforts to promote health as a human right.",

As with the 3 \u00d7 5 Initiative, the leaders of All by 2010 explicitly state that this effort is designed to mobilize stakeholders, maintain momentum, and encourage states to contribute.

Failure to achieve and the behaviours associated with it were explained within the context of the norm itself. \u2018The \u201c3 by 5\u201d target needs to be seen as an interim step toward the ultimate goal of universal access to antiretroviral therapy for those in need of care, as a human right, and within the context of a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS\u2019 (World Health Organization /UNAIDS 2006: 49). The G8 nations, the very nations that provided the vast majority of funding for the programmes that came under the 3 \u00d7 5 Initiative's umbrella, pledged in July 2005 to work toward universal access to ARVs worldwide by 2010. At the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July 2005, the leaders of the world's largest economies pledged at least an extra US$50 billion in aid annually, part of which would be specifically pledged for universal ARV access (Office of the Prime Minister 2005). Two months later, the United Nations passed a resolution calling on member states to work toward this goal and to pledge the necessary resources (AVERT n.d.). In 2006, the UN High-Level Meeting on AIDS produced a resolution that stated in part, \u2018[We commit] to pursue all necessary efforts to scale up nationally driven, sustainable and comprehensive responses to achieve broad multisectoral coverage for prevention, treatment, care and support, with full and active participation of people living with HIV, vulnerable groups, most affected communities, civil society and the private sector, towards the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010\u2019 (United Nations 2006).

            "text": "The international community has clearly embraced the normative rhetoric of universal ARV access, tying it to the realization of individual human rights and a broadened conceptualization of governance. The United Nations' 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS resolved that \u2018access to medication in the context of pandemics such as HIV/AIDS is one of the fundamental elements to achieve progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\u2019 (United Nations 2001). Within months of the unveiling of the 3 \u00d7 5 Initiative, all 192 member states of the WHO publicly endorsed the program and the norm contained within it. They publicly pledged to aggressively work toward the realization of this goal and, in a broader sense, to ensure that all those who needed ARVs could get them. The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific passed a resolution that called on states in the region to scale up their public health programs specifically in response to the 3 \u00d7 5 Initiative (UNESCAP 2004). In May 2005, over 120 delegates from around the world came together in Geneva to coordinate efforts to rapidly scale up efforts to expand access to ARVs across political, economic, and religious lines. The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), its primary AIDS programming effort, strongly emphasizes antiretroviral therapy (and its attendant infrastructure), considering it an integral part of its AIDS programmes and part of the US\u2019 obligation as a leading member of international society (Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator 2006). When announcing PEPFAR during his 2003 State of the Union address, US President George W. Bush noted, \u2018Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, \u201cWe have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you\u2019ve got AIDS, we can\u2019t help you. Go home and die.\u201d In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words\u2019 (Bush 2003). This statement received a tremendous amount of applause. Making this proclamation during his most important speech of the year shows that the norm of universal ARV access is at least fomenting rhetorical changes. Four years later, when Bush called on Congress to reauthorize PEPFAR by providing US$30 billion over the next five years, he highlighted the normative aspects of the programme. Acknowledging the costs and the number of people affected by the programme, he emphasized, \u2018The statistics and dollar amounts I\u2019ve cited in the fight against HIV/AIDS are significant. But the scale of this effort is not measured in numbers. This is really a story of the human spirit and the goodness of human hearts\u2026Our citizens are offering comfort to millions who suffer, and restoring hope to those who feel forsaken\u2019 (Bush 2007).",

For funding, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria emerged in 2001. The Global Fund is an independent organization, with representatives from donor and recipient governments, nongovernmental organizations and the private sector, with responsibility for funding AIDS-related programmes. It explicitly does not implement programmes on its own. Instead, it provides a centralized source for donors to contribute money and recipients to receive grants to implement programmes (Van Kerkhoff and Szleza 2006). Unique among most international bodies, the Global Fund relies upon funds from national governments, nongovernmental organizations, private philanthropies, and the sale of specially branded consumer products (Dyer 2006). Programmes funded by the Global Fund may be implemented by governments or nongovernmental organizations, broadening the realm of actors who can help realize the behavioural expectations of this new norm.",

It has sought to \u2018transform the antiretroviral marketplace from a low-volume, high-margin market to a high-volume, low-margin market that serves millions of HIV/AIDS patients\u2019 (Clinton Foundation n.d.). This strategy significantly reduces the price for ARVs while still allowing generic and branded pharmaceutical manufacturers to recoup their investment in developing ARVs. The Foundation has forcefully argued that it has not asked for charity, but rather sought to ensure supply at an affordable price in the face of large demand (Rauch 2007). The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's wealthiest philanthropic organization, collaborated with the government of Botswana and the pharmaceutical company Merck to create the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnership. This arrangement brings together the financial resources of the Gates Foundation, the manufacturing and distribution capabilities of Merck, and the infrastructure of Botswana to deliver ARVs to those in need (Gates Foundation 2006; Ramiah and Reich 2006). These two efforts demonstrate the significant role that non-state actors play in actualizing universal ARV access.",

In the 1980s, many national governments specifically cited the personal lobbying of Jonathan Mann, then the head of the United Nations\u2019 Global Program on AIDS, as the reason they increased their contributions to AIDS control efforts (Gordenker et al. 1995: 74). In the case of universal ARV access, the effort was really spearheaded by Lee, Piot, and Feachem (Mann died in a plane crash in 1998). These three had the connections and experience that allowed them access to the highest levels of governments. They also took a very intense personal interest in the promotion of this newly developing norm. All three men had impressive resumes working with HIV/AIDS and ensuring access to health care in developing nations. Lee, who himself died suddenly in May 2006, devoted one of his last speeches to building on the lessons from the 3 \u00d7 5 Initiative to promote universal ARV access (Lee 2006). In addition, these three key norm entrepreneurs had impressive organizational bases \u2014 the World Health Organization, UNAIDS, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, respectively \u2014 from which to promote their norm and encourage states to adopt it. Successful norm entrepreneurs can benefit from such a platform. Mahler, during the promotion of Health for All by 2000, held the same position as Lee, so what explains the difference? For one thing, his was a more solitary voice. Mahler was essentially the only leader on the international stage promoting universal primary health care. This made his task more daunting. Second, international health organizations have greater prominence today than they did in the 1970s and early 1980s. The international community came together to form the Global Fund, UNAIDS builds on the strengths of multiple UN-affiliated agencies, and the WHO has received greater attention and respect thanks to its successful handling of crises like SARS, avian flu, and the Asian tsunami recovery efforts.",

The growing discussions around health as a human right allows proponents of the norm of universal ARV access to frame their issue in a manner that resonates with government officials and the public. Advocates can use frames that match with ideas or images already present in a culture to gain support. This can be particularly important when high costs are involved. The proper frame encourages policymakers to look past their financial concerns to understand how that frame matches with an underlying constitutive identity. Busby (2007) uses frames to understand how Jesse Helms, a conservative US Senator, and Bono, the Irish rock star, came together to support debt relief for poor countries when the issue was framed as one of Biblical justice. Making this appeal in the context of an existing belief \u2014 a shared Christian faith, in this case \u2014 allowed the issue of debt relief to move forward in spite of the financial cost. In the same way, universal ARV access\u2019 advocates could draw upon the growing recognition that developed states have an obligation to help those less fortunate and that health is a fundamental aspect of dignified human existence (Mann et al. 1999; Harris and Siplon 2006).

Human rights norms did not simply emerge on their own, and states did not adopt them thoughtlessly. Instead, the diffusion of human rights norms depended upon a sustained network of domestic and international networks that could connect to policymakers and international regimes. These networks put pressure on states, helped redefine the international normative context in a manner amenable to the embrace of these norms, and empowered actors to appeal for recognition of the norms (Risse and Sikkink 1998: 5). Activists framed human rights norms in ways that would resonate with existing domestic political cultures in various countries (Risse and Ropp 1998: 271). Some states may have initially embraced human rights norms for instrumental reasons (Risse and Sikkink 1998: 10), but this process itself encouraged states to redefine their identities. Human rights norms went from being policy choices to constitutive elements of how states saw themselves and their respect for basic human morality (Donnelly 1999: 73).

It demonstrates how norms can evolve within the international community and take on new life when international political situations and norm entrepreneurs change. States are working toward universal ARV access despite the very high costs and the potentially negative consequences for Western pharmaceutical companies. To uphold the norm, they engage in actions that may not be economically profitable and explain their failures to live up to the norm's obligations in terms of those obligations themselves.",

The emergence of universal ARV access enriches our understanding of how and why the international community embraces certain norms. It has shown the importance of moving beyond a state-centric view of norm emergence and adoption. Non-state actors, such as nongovernmental organizations, philanthropic groups, and multinational corporations play an increasingly important role in international governance, and that role extends to their influence on international norms. Universal ARV access also makes clear the importance of complementary norms for successful adoption. Universal primary health care failed, in part, because it did not resonate with dominant norms within the international community at the time. Finally, universal ARV access highlights just how important framing by norm entrepreneurs can be. Universal ARV access\u2019 supporters cast the issue as one of individual human rights being realized by a broad-based coalition of state and non-state actors. This worked far better than the broader collective public good supported by developed states frame employed in the discussions around universal primary health care.",

By internalizing this norm, states are redefining their obligations to each other when it comes to providing health care. They are establishing new standards of behaviour, standards by which their actions will be judged by others. International ethical obligations are changing for the better of humanity. Earlier efforts to inculcate progressive norms that ensure access to health care may have failed, but contemporary norm entrepreneurs demonstrate that it is indeed possible to foster international health-related norms.",
