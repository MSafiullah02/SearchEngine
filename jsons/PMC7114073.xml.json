            "text": "IBV is caused by a Coronavirus, which was first identified in 1936. The coronaviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA genome of approximately 27 Kb. The 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)) and four non-structural accessory proteins. Genetic diversity in coronaviruses, due to adaptive evolution, is created both by recombination events and by mutations, such as substitutions, deletions and insertions, that occur when the viral genome is replicated. The high mutation rates are attributed to the minimal proofreading capabilities of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, while recombination events are thought to result from a unique template-switching copy-choice mechanism during RNA replication (Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011). Similarly to other coronaviruses, the high mutation and recombination rate of IBV has led to the emergence of several new variants, particularly in Europe and North America where poultry are intensively raised. However, it is believed that only a small proportion of the total IBV genetic variability has been identified. In particular, the S1 protein has been demonstrated to have the highest variability of the whole viral genome (Cavanagh & Naqi, 2003). This protein, constituting the outermost part of the virion, is involved in host cell attachment and contains virus-neutralizing epitopes. Consequently, mutation and recombination events in the S1 gene are critically important for the emergence of new serotypes of the virus that are able to cause disease in other host species. The continuous emergence of new IBV serotypes has prompted the development of appropriate control programmes aimed to mitigate the low degree of cross-protection observed among IBV serotypes (Dolz et al., 2008).",

In the last few years, the most predominant genotypes in both countries were QX and 793B (Franzo et al., 2014; Blanco et al., 2015). However, beginning in 2012, a new IBV variant related to the CK/CH/Guandong/Xindadi/0903 (XDN) variant (Ji et al., 2011) was detected in Italy and Spain. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate and genetically characterize the XDN variant. We sequenced the complete S1 gene of several IBV strains isolated in Italy and Spain that were closely related to the XDN variant. In addition, we compared these sequences with the XDN reference sequence and with other IBV sequences available in GenBank to perform phylogenetic, molecular and recombination analyses.",

The database size was reduced by collapsing the sequences into clusters that shared 98% sequence identity using CD-HIT. The sequences obtained in the present study were aligned with one sequence representative of each cluster using the MAFFT method implemented in GUIDANCE2, and the alignment score was calculated using the same software. To account for the coding nature of the genomic region, the S1 sequences were first aligned at the amino acid level, and then, the nucleotide sequences were superimposed. Exploratory phylogenetic trees were performed on the partial and complete S1 gene using the maximum likelihood method in the IQ-TREE software (Nguyen et al., 2015). The recombination analysis was performed on this database using the RDP4 recombination analysis programme. The different method settings were adjusted according to the programme\u2019s manual (Martin et al., 2015). To obtain a conservative estimate, a recombination event was accepted only when detected by two or more methods implemented in the programme, with a P-value lower than 0.05. To refine the recombination pattern analysis, a similar analysis was carried out on a smaller database including all recombinants and corresponding parental strains; two Massachusetts (Mass)-like strains were also added as an outgroup. Finally, a collection of recombination-free partitions was obtained for each recombination event by dividing the original alignment at the recombination breakpoints. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for each partition using RAXML (Silvestro & Michalak, 2012) and used to calculate per-site log likelihoods for each alignment partition. Statistical significance of the topological incongruence between segments separated by recombination breakpoints was assessed through SH, KH, ELW and AU tests implemented in CONSEL. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all statistical tests.",

We then estimated the rates of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitutions per site (ratio dN/dS) for both the Spanish and Italian data sets using the single likelihood ancestor counting and the fixed effects likelihood methods available through Datamonkey (online version of the Hy-Phy package) (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2005). A model of best fit for nucleotide substitutions was estimated for each data set according to the Akaike information criterion. To understand the degree of variation in the S1 gene, the entropy of the aligned amino acid sequences within this gene for the different isolates was calculated using BioEdit (version 7.0.9.0). Entropy is a useful quantification of diversity at a single position of amino acid sequences. Large entropy indicates that the amino acid in the given position is prone to substitution. A higher peak indicates a larger entropy and a higher variation frequency of the amino acid site. Conserved residues will have an entropy value close to 0, but these values will increase to 1 as the variability for an amino acid position increases. An entropy value higher than 0.4 indicates the corresponding amino acid position is not conserved (Mo et al., 2013).",

The results of this study showed that genotyping based on partial sequencing of the S1 gene was not representative of genotyping based on the whole gene in some of the variants. In the present study, these discrepancies were due to the presence of recombination events involving the S1 HVR. Recombination has been suggested to play an important role in viral evolution. Exchange of a long region of the genome allows viruses to rapidly explore ample areas of the sequence space, potentially leading to the emergence of variants with different features in terms of virulence, cross-protection and cell and host tropism (Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011). Recombination, similar to mutation, is likely to have a high fitness cost due to the destruction of optimized intra- and inter-protein interactions (Simon-Loriere & Holmes, 2011). Additionally, recombinant strains must display a fitness superior to the parental fitness to emerge and spread in the environment. In our study, convincing evidence showed four distinct recombination events affecting the S1 gene, suggesting that this gene is prone to recombination at multiple sites.",

            "text": "The first prerequisite for recombination is co-infection. In the last 4 years, the partial S1 gene was sequenced from samples collected in 1968 (1248 Italian and 720 Spanish samples) and the presence of different IBV genotypes was detected. In Italy the predominant genotypes were QX (37.3%), XDN (1.2%), 793B (44.1%), M41 (5%) and 624I/Q1 (10.8%) (Massi et al., 2015), whereas in Spain, the main genotypes were QX (12.2%), XDN (19.4%), 793B (64.4%) and IT02 (4%) (Blanco et al., 2015). Interestingly, the It02 serotype, which was highly distributed throughout Italy until 2007 and Spain until 2011, has recently been replaced by other serotypes, such as QX and 793B. The genotype 624I/Q1 reappeared in Italy in 2010 after 3\u20134 years in which it was probably circulating below the cut-off level for detection (Franzo et al., 2014; Massi et al., 2015). Considering the high prevalence of the QX and 793B genotypes in both countries, it is reasonable to speculate that these genotypes co-infect birds more frequently compared to the other genotypes. Moreover, control of IBV in the commercial poultry industry is through the use of live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Because little or no cross-protection occurs between the different IBV serotypes or variants, different virus antigenic types must be used for vaccine development. Antigenic types, such as Mass-based or 793B-type, have been commonly used in both countries for a long time. Recently (in 2013 in Spain and 2014 in Italy), a new QX vaccine was registered, but is currently not highly distributed. The current vaccines induce a non-sterilizing immunity, which allows prolonged replication, shedding and circulation of the vaccine viruses, particularly when only part of the population is effectively vaccinated. It is likely that vaccination with live attenuated vaccines produces an environment where co-infection between field (i.e. QX genotype) and vaccine (i.e. 793B genotype) strains can enhance the likelihood of recombination. High frequencies of recombination between vaccine and field strains have frequently been reported (Cavanagh et al., 1992; McKinley et al., 2011; Jackwood et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2014). However, the shorter persistence and shedding of Mass-based vaccines (Bijlenga et al., 2004) and the low percentage of the M41 genotype in both countries (Blanco et al., 2015; Massi et al., 2015) support the absence of recombinants for this genotype. In fact, partial sequencing of the S1 gene showed that a high number of detected field strains were of the 793B vaccines, or vaccine-derived strains (Franzo et al., 2014).",

The other three motifs were observed in a few of the isolated strains. In addition, one was present in the only strain placed in the 793B clade and was shared by the majority of the strains belonging to this genotype. We also found that individual strains with high similarities usually shared the same motifs.",

Firstly, a preliminary analysis using BLAST and/or phylogenetic analysis is typically performed during routine diagnostic procedures in many laboratories, which in this study led to the classification of the investigated strains into the XDN group that originated in China. This misclassification could have led us to infer new introduction events inaccurately, which would severely bias the validity and potentially the efficacy of virus control measures. Secondly, even if the cost/benefit of the extensive use of vaccination to control IBV infections is far from being understood, this study stresses the importance of improving vaccination tools in terms of both protection and application.",
