Serum IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected using commercially available indirect ELISA kits (BGI-GBI; Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions [6] . The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV were 99%-100% and 89%-97.2%, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for the detection of IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV were 89.8% and 97.6%, respectively [6] [7] [8] . An indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV was performed using a commercially available IFA kit (Euroimmun), according to the manufacturer's instructions [9] . This IFA has a specificity of 100% (with detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in 200 healthy blood donors) and a sensitivity of 97%-100% (with detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in 150 serum specimens obtained, at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms, from patients with SARS). In-house IFAs for the detection of IgG specific to human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 were performed as described by us elsewhere [10] . A microneutralization assay was performed according to procedures described elsewhere, with modifications [1] . In brief, a 96-well microtiter plate that contained confluent fetal rhesus kidney-4 cells in 100 mL of maintenance medium was prepared. Two-fold dilutions of patient serum samples (50 mL), which started at 1:10 and increased to 1:320, were premixed with 50 mL TCID 50 of SARS-CoV (the HKU-39849 isolate) and were incubated at 37\u040aC for 1.5 h. Then, 100 mL of the virus-serum mixture was inoculated in duplicate wells with fetal rhesus kidney-4 cells and was further incubated at 37\u040aC. A cytopathic effect was observed at 72 and 96 h. The neutralization titer was determined to be the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that produced 50% cytopathic effect on cells.

This asymptomatic case of infection occurred in a 31-year-old woman who was working as a service chief in the local restaurant TDLR [2] , where the second index case patient worked as a waitress [2, 3] . Although the asymptomatic case patient had only indirect contact with the second index case patient, she had a history of clear and close animal (i.e., palm civet) contact. She often showed the wild animals to customers who were ordering exotic food. Subsequently, SARS-CoV N protein was detected, by use of N antigen-capture ELISA, in 5 of a total of 6 palm civet serum samples obtained during the same period from the restaurant TDLR; results revealed a high level of N protein, with a mean OD 450 value of 1.556, compared with the cutoff value of 0.21. Viral RNA was also detected in all throat and rectal swab specimens obtained from 6 palm civets, by use of RT-PCR for the detection of polyprotein and N genes of SARS-CoV, and 3 full genome sequences and 2 complete S gene sequences of SARS-CoV were identified in the specimens obtained from 5 of 6 palm civets [3] . When this information is considered together with the viral genomic information from the palm civets that was collected from the same restaurant during the same period [2] [3] , the clear conclusion is that the palm civets used for exotic food in the restaurant must have been heavily contaminated with SARS-CoV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 235, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 299, "end": 301, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1173, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1347, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1351, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "With the limited samples available, the kinematics of the antigenemia and antibody responses of the second index case patient were compared with those of the asymptomatic case patient. The asymptomatic case patient had antigenemia (i.e., detection of N antigen in serum; antigenemia was detected in the asymptomatic case patient on 6 January 2004) disappear at almost the same time as it disappeared in the second index case patient (who had detectable antigenemia up to 5 January 2004). Meanwhile, the second index case patient had seroconversion occur on 3 January 2004, whereas the asymptomatic case patient had a positive antibody result from 6 January 2004; however, because serum samples were unavailable before this date, the exact date of seroconversion cannot be determined. Nevertheless, because the mean incubation period for SARS is 6 days [12] , it seems that the asymptomatic case patient was unlikely to have acquired infection directly from the second e4 \u2022 CID 2006:43 (1 July) \u2022 Che et al. index case patient. Combining the epidemiological information regarding the contact history with the molecular diagnostic profiling of either the animals (the palm civets) or the human (the second index case patient), we infer that this asymptomatic case of SARS was more likely to have resulted from an animalto-human infection (likely due to SARS-CoV carried by the palm civets from the restaurant) than from the second index case patient. SARS is a zoonotic disease. SARS-CoV evolved consistently and rapidly within its animal and human hosts, while both the infectivity of the virus and the severity of the disease varied, along with the variation/adaptation of the virus to its hosts [2, 13] . It is particularly significant that even in the \"early phase\" of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic [13] , human-to-human transmission of infection was observed, and the symptoms were so severe that the disease was eventually named after its primary symptomatic characteristics. However, in the 2003-2004 community outbreak of SARS, none of the 4 index case patients with confirmed SARS had severe illness, and they all seemed to have acquired infection with SARS-CoV directly from animals. Although SARS-CoV-specific antibodies previously had been detected at a relatively high rate among the population handling wild animals or had been observed in health care workers [14] [15] [16] , it was impossible to correlate serological results with the corresponding onset of clinical symptoms in these retrospective screenings.

To date, molecular epidemiological data have indicated that, although it might take decades for SARS-CoV to evolve into a contagious strain for human infection, it would not be too difficult for SARS-CoV to reach the stage in which it might cause infection either without symptoms or with mild symptoms in humans. This process could be accelerated if appropriate susceptible animal hosts, such as palm civets, were largely present together with the human population. On the other hand, if the highrisk population with infection can be properly monitored at the asymptomatic stage and the disease can be promptly controlled at the mildly symptomatic stage (both objectives are technically feasible now), future threats of a reemerging SARS epidemic could be much lower than once was surmised.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 244, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Table 2.
