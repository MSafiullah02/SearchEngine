The hospital resources can get exhausted quickly and medical personnel can be under tremendous work stress, both clinical and psychological. Hence, existing resources have to be preserved and additional generated immediately. In coming days, a large number of patients may suddenly require oxygen therapy, tracheal intubation and ventilatory support. The facilities, devices and equipments for the same should be updated with repairs, services, replacements and fresh purchases as per the demand assessment.There should be adequate oxygen delivery devices, adequate oxygen reserve and multiple tracheal intubation teams have to be designated. A pool of anaesthesiologists has to be created at city branch level so that anaesthesiologists can be immediately shifted to the area of increased demand.Elective and semi-emergency surgeries should be deferred till the outbreak of COVID-19 is contained. Only emergency surgeries should be undertaken.Non-urgent and non-time sensitive consultations; surgical, interventional and diagnostic procedures should be rescheduled to a later date when the COVID transmission is contained in the community. The decision for urgent and time-sensitive procedures (cancer surgeries) should be taken as a team, based on the available resources and patient's clinical condition. This will conserve manpower, personal protective equipment and critical care beds.Transmission of COVID-19 can also occur from the anaesthesia workplace. Frequent hand washing by the anaesthesiologists is essential. Designated operating rooms having a dedicated anaesthesia machine and cart for high infection risk situations has to be done.If need arises, anaesthesia machine ventilators in the operation theatres will be used as ventilators and OT will have to be used as Intensive Care Units. Anaesthesiologists will take care of ventilatory settings and ensure non delivery of anaesthetic gases to the patients.\n",

N95 masks offer protection against droplet and airborne transmission of 95% of particles more than 0.3 microns in size. Surgical face masks protect against COVID-19 droplet transmission but do not protect against aerosolized small particles. Wear disposable caps and beard covers to decrease the risk of hand contamination by touching hair that may have been exposed to droplets.Do mock drills for correct donning and doffing of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gown, face mask, eye shields and gloves.Do Mock intubation/extubation drills wearing PPE.Aerosol-generating procedures are tracheal intubation and extubation, suctioning, nebulization, CPAP, BiPAP or high flow nasal oxygen therapy. Aerosolization is also increased when more than one attempt at intubation is required.\n",

            "text": "\nDedicated Operation Theatres to be used for all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infected patients. These operation theatres should be labeled \u201cCOVID-19 Operation Theatre\u201d and large clear bill boards and signage, visible from a distance, should be placed outside such OTs.COVID-19 infected patients should be wheeled through separate/isolated corridors to the operation theatre. The patients should be wheeled directly in to the OT. They should not stay in pre-medication room at all.Since majority of operation theatres in India are not negatively pressurized, the positive pressure system and air conditioning must be turned off. Laminar flow and the functional high-efficiency filters are preferable.All operation theatre staff should wear PPE including anaesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technician, bearer, sweeper, etc. PPE included one piece special gown, properly fitted N95/N99 mask, eye shield and double gloves. Wear hospital scrubs inside and protective coveralls outside; wear a medical protective mask, disposable surgical cap, and goggles/face shield; and wear disposable medical latex gloves and boot covers. The suggested sequence for putting on personal protective equipment is as follows: putting on scrubs and hair cover \u2192 performing hand hygiene \u2192 putting on the mask \u2192 putting on inner gloves \u2192 putting on the coverall \u2192 putting on eye protection (goggles/face shield) \u2192 putting on foot protection \u2192 putting on the isolation gown \u2192 putting on outer gloves \u2192 test the fit of the personal protective equipment components.Place all equipments and drugs required for the anaesthetic management in a tray and avoid handling of the drug trolley during the case.Place two high quality Heat and Moisture Exchange Filters (HMEFs). First, between tracheal tube and breathing circuit; and the second between expiratory limb and anaesthesia machine. These HME filters can remove up to 99% of airborne particles 0.3 microns or greater, thus help in preventing contamination of OT atmosphere.Standard routine anaesthesia monitoring to be instituted.Prefer regional anaesthesia, where ever possible. A surgical mask or N95 mask must be applied to the patient throughout the length of stay in the operating room. In case supplementary oxygen is needed, the oxygen mask is applied over the surgical mask or N95 mask.For general anaesthesia, pre-oxygenate for five minutes with 100% oxygen. Avoid high flow oxygen to prevent aerosolization. Ask the patient not to cough. It is prudent to cover the patient's nose and mouth with two layers of wet gauze to block some of the secretions.Rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation (with cricoid pressure) to be done in the first attempt. Ensure adequate neuromuscular blockade to avoid bucking that can increase aerosolization. Immediately inflate the tracheal tube cuff before starting ventilation.The choice of induction drugs is dictated by haemodynamic considerations. Midazolam with etomidate or propofol, depending upon patient's haemodynamic condition, can be used for induction. Fentanyl is recommended for analgesia. If no contraindications are present, succinylcholine 1 mg/kg should be administered for tracheal intubation.Avoid manual ventilation to prevent aerosolization of virus from airways. If manual ventilation is required, apply small tidal volumes.Tracheal intubation should be done by experienced anaesthesiologists. Limit the number of anaesthesia team personnel (maximum three) inside the OT. Second clinician with PPE can be available outside the OT for immediate assistance.Avoid awake fibreoptic intubation whenever possible. Nebulization with local anesthetic will aerosolize the virus.Video-laryngoscope (if available) can be used to improve intubation success. Also, it may increase the distance between the patient's airway and that of the anaesthesiologist who performs the intubation.Re-sheath the laryngoscope blade immediately post intubation with the outer glove worn by the operator.Use low gas flows and closed circuits. Limit the ventilatory disconnections and, if needed, do at end expiratory phase.A closed airway suction system, if available, is preferable to decrease viral aerosol production. If it is not available, the suction should be done by minimum members of the team.Supraglottic airway devices should be used only in 'cannot ventilate' situations. This will avoid manual bagging and provide rescue oxygenation.Prophylactic administration of anti-emetic drug is preferred to reduce the risk of vomiting and viral spread.Tracheal extubation should be done on table, as far as possible. After tracheal extubation, patient to be transferred to the isolation ward. If tracheal extubation is not feasible, then shift the patient to designated Intensive Care Unit (ICU).During transfer, the team should wear proper PPE outside the operating room. The patient should be covered with one disposable operating sheet and then transferred through a dedicated lobby and elevator. The patient must wear a surgical mask or N95 mask during transfer. The surfaces of passage ways and the elevator should be cleaned. If the patient is kept intubated, a single-patient-use Ambu bag with HME filter attached must be used during transfer. Do not use a ventilator during transfer.Discard breathing circuit, mask, tracheal tube, HME filters, gas sampling line and soda lime after every patient. Water trap to be changed if it becomes potentially contaminated.Seal all used airway equipment in a double zip-locked plastic bag. It must then be removed for decontamination and disinfection.After removing protective equipment, avoid touching your hair or face before washing hands.A minimum of one hour is planned between cases to allow OT staff to send the patient back to the ward, conduct through decontamination of all surfaces, screens, keyboard, cables, monitors and anaesthesia machine with 2 to 3% hydrogen peroxide spray disinfection, 2-5 g/l chlorine disinfectant, or 75% alcohol wiping of solid surfaces of the equipment and floor. The hydrogen peroxide vaporizer is an added precaution to decontaminate the OT.All unused items on the drug tray and airway trolley should be assumed to be contaminated and discarded. All staff has to take shower before resuming their regular duties.In resource limited settings, where adequate personal protective equipments are not available, it is imperative to refer the patient to a centre with such facilities.\n",

The few indications of continuous neuromuscular blockade in the setting of severe ARDS are ventilator dyssynchrony, inability to achieve target tidal volumes or refractory hypoxemia/hypercapnia. In fulminating cases, prone ventilation for 12-18 hours per day is useful.\n",
