Congregations of the faithful at local and transnational level are 12 strongly recommended by several world religions and religious orders. Gathering of large 13 number of people in close approximation could be a fertile ground for the spread of novel 14 pathogens. The refusal to suspend such gatherings could lead to potential widespread dispersal of 15 infections. 16 17 18 same time. Muslim organizations in Non-Muslim countries also followed suit. Some 87 conservatives in other countries argued for continuing congregational prayers at the mosque. 88 Nevertheless, most of them fell in line, but by that time much damage had been done. 89 A Christian congregation in South Korea was the cause of a large number of COVID-19 cases. 90 After an initial success in limiting the spread, there was a sudden spurt of cases from third week 91 of February 2020, originating from an infected patient attending the Shincheonji Church of 92 Jesus. The Cult believes that illness is a sin and the sufferer must attend prayers to atone for the 93 sin (Park, 2020). This belief motivated its followers to avoid testing and some covertly continued 94 attending the masses. This only augmented the problem. A large number of the cult's followers 95 were tested and 5,209 were found positive till April 8 2020 (Statista 2020). 96 COVID-19 infection rates among the ultra-orthodox Jews of Israel were disproportionately high 97 compared to other Israelis. It is suspected that as many as 40% residents of an ultraorthodox 98 neighborhood could be infected. Besides big families and crowded living, unflinching 99 observations of communal religious prayers are considered as important reasons. The 100 synagogues in this particular neighborhood had massive attendance during the Jewish holiday of 101 Purim on March 9 2020. The community continued its religious gatherings thereafter and refused 102 to suspend them (Tarnopolosk, 2020) 103 In Northwester Indian state of Punjab, a 70 years old Sikh priest after returning from Italy and 104",

Most 27 world religions prescribe congregations of its adherents at local, national and international levels 28 as part of their faith. This mobilization and gathering could serve as a potential focal point for 29 dispersal of novel pathogens, especially those transmitted through the respiratory route. The 30 events related to COVID-19 spread among certain religious assemblies seemingly corroborate it. 31 To circumvent this possibility, ideally, assembly of people needs to be suspended during such 32 times. It is also imperative that all possible preventive measures be exercised during ordinary 33 times to reduce the chances of cross infections in prayer meetings. The RC needs to be looked at 34 from this perspective. It has a direct bearing on the extent of epidemic diseases and their spread 35 globally. COVID-19 should serve as game changer in the manner in which we deal with 36 infectious disease outbreaks from the perspective of RC and their suspension.",

Hajj is one of the five Islam. It is the annual gathering of Muslims in Mecca city of Saudi Arabia. 42 Umrah is visiting the grand mosque at Mecca at any other time. 43 Communal gatherings among Muslims are also prescribed by certain Muslim sects and 44 organizations. Tablighi Jamaat originated in pre-independent India as an Islamic revivalist 45 movement. (Ali, 2003). The group has grown phenomenally over the years and boost of 46 membership from several countries. Shiite Islam is a major sect, which emphasizes on public commemoration of events in the early Islamic history. Shrines of the Shiites are major pilgrim 48 centers (Luz, 2020).49 Iran was one of the badly hit countries. It is a prime example of how RC can impact disease 50 transmission. The first COVID-19 deaths were reported from the Shiite religious city of Qom on 51 February 19, 2020. The disease had apparently started two to three weeks earlier. The head of the 52 main shrine in Qom appealed to the pilgrims to keep coming to the shrine and called it as a place 53 of healing. This apparently led to spread of the infection unabated, not only within Iran but 54 around a dozen countries in the neighborhood (Wright, 2020). 55 Three Tablighi Jamaat meetings in Malaysia, Pakistan and India acted as COVID-19 hotspots. 56 The beginning was from the Tablighi gathering at Malaysia from February 27 to March 3. As 57 many as 1,545 COVID-19 cases in Malaysia were linked to the assembly of Tablighi Jamaat in 58 Kaula Lumpur. (Daim, 2020). This apparently acted as source of the infection for the subsequent 59 two gatherings at Pakistan and India as the infected Malaysians attended them. Around 150,000 60 preachers, mostly from Pakistan but some from other Muslim countries gathered for a Tablighi 61 Ijtema, a congregation of the preachers, on March 12, 2020 in the eastern Pakistani city of et al., 2020). 66 Tablighi Markaz in the Nizamuddin area of Delhi, the Capital city of India, is the global 67 headquarter of the Tablighi Jamaat. Preachers from India and abroad visit this place for 68 deliberations and learning of the Islamic texts. On March 30, 2020, 300 of its members were 69 isolated and tested for COVID-19 after it emerged that a gathering of the preachers had included 70 Malaysians and Indonesians. By April 4, 2020, 1023 people linked to this Tablighi Jamaat 71 congregation had tested positive across the country (Kumar, 2020). By this time several 72 attendees of the congregation had already dispersed before the cluster was identified. Apparently 73 many of them have carried the virus to their native states, posing the threat of wider community 74 spread. 75 Though no ethnic breakup of Britain's COVID-19 patient could be availed, the independent 76 newspaper reported that Muslims have faced the wrath of the pandemic severely. Large extended 77 families, handshaking and attendance of mosque were cited as the possible reasons (Hussain, 78 2020). 79 Saudi Arabia is home to the two holiest places of Islam, Mecca and Medina, where millions of 80 pilgrims from several countries visit throughout the year. Saudi Arabia suspended all Umrah 81 pilgrimage on March 4, 2020. This was a prompt and preemptive step to forestall any potential 82 COVID-19 outbreak among the pilgrims. Continuation of the pilgrimage could have posed a 83 serious threat of local and international spread. Saudi Arabia was one of the few Islamic 84 countries to suspend congregation prayers in the mosque as early as March 17, 2020. All the \uf0b7\uf020 Religious congregations could potentially prove to be transmission and dispersal hubs of 194 such pathogen as seen with COVID-19 hotspots.",
