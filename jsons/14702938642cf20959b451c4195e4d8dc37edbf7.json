With its previous experience of dealing with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2003, well-trained and experienced teams of officials in Taiwan quickly recognized the crisis and activated emergency management structures to address the emerging outbreak, thus preventing a large-scale pandemic. 2,3 (see Table 1 , Fig. 1 )",

Pre-triage executed the epidemic investigation and patient diversion. The red zone comprised of two parts: red zone 1 and red zone 2. Red zone 1 includes four private indoor negative-pressure isolation rooms, with inbound doors next to the entrance of our ED, fully equipped with O 2 supply and monitors for patients at high risk or possibly infected patients with unstable conditions. Red zone 2 includes an outdoor fever screening station (one room and four tents, including the physician's office room with air conditioning, laboratory and portable X-ray machine, patient waiting area, swab inspection tent, and personal protective equipment removal tent) for processing patients with minor symptoms, potential exposures, or mass screening, who need throat swab survey. The yellow zone is a separate area inside the ED that serves as a buffer zone dealing with bed-waiting patients diagnosed with lung infiltration on chest radiographs or pneumonia, without travel, occupation, contact, cluster (TOCC) history, and who may not be screened immediately in the ED. As the healthcare workers transition between the zones, hand disinfection with 75% alcohol is performed at each step. Each transition point is clearly delineated with signage and door, and each zone includes prominently posted descriptions of the steps to be taken there.",

Because the negative pressure isolation beds in the hospital are limited, the chest medicine and infectious diseases specialists inspect patients in this area every day to confirm the need for quarantine. The red zone has a separate group of healthcare workers to prevent cross infection with other areas, including regular cleaning staff. Personal protective equipment in the red zone includes a N95 mask covered by a surgical mask, hair cap, goggles or facial shield, gloves, gown, and shoe coverings. The daily healthcare team in the red zone includes 11 nurses, four doctors, three security guards, and four cleaning staff members. All clearance operations in the red zone are carried out in accordance with the standard operation procedures of the CDC medical institutions' guidelines in Taiwan in response to the COVID-19 infection control measures. 1 We designed a comprehensive patient diversion strategy including space partition, patient diversion, and staff subdivision at the ED. This design separated the patients at risk of COVID-19 infection to prevent in-hospital infection. From January 21 to April 16, 2020, the average daily visits to the red zone 1, red zone 2, and yellow zone were 5, 29, and 13, respectively. Nine new cases of COVID-19 infection were diagnosed, with no nosocomial infection cases.",
