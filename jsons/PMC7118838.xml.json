In Hong Kong, the first confirmed case of S-OIV was diagnosed in a traveller from Mexico on 1 May 2009.3 As of 20 August 2009, there were 8210 laboratory-confirmed cases with four deaths. Here, we report the effect of such measures on the occurrence of nosocomial S-OIV in our hospital.",

Open staff forum and special education sessions were arranged by the hospital administration and infection control team. Nasopharygneal aspirates or nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were collected from cases, either patients or HCWs, who had upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. Direct immunofluorescent antigen test for influenza A and other respiratory viruses (influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, and adenovirus) and reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for S-OIV H1 gene were performed, as previously described.3, 4 The infection control team checked with the microbiology laboratory on a daily basis for positive results. Cases were reviewed to determine the route of acquisition. For patients, they were considered as having community-acquired infection if they presented with URTI symptoms within 48 h of admission, without history of contact with any confirmed case in the hospital. For HCWs, they were considered as having community-acquired infection if they had confirmed cases in their household with no history of unprotected exposure to any confirmed case in the hospital. Otherwise, the case was classified as nosocomial infection. Unprotected exposure was defined as the contact within 1 m between a confirmed case and the exposed with both of them not having worn a surgical mask, whereas protected exposure meant that either one had worn a surgical mask during their contact.Box IInfection control strategic bundle in prevention of nosocomial transmission of swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) A H1N1\n1.\u2018Just-in-time\u2019 education of infection control practice to healthcare workers(i)Open infection control forum for all staff and special session for various clinical departments(ii)Special session for staff who are attending isolation facilities(iii)Special session for staff when inpatients and co-workers are confirmed with S-OIV\n2.Enhanced infection control practice(i)Enforcement of standard and transmission-based precaution in clinical area, especially with directly observed hand hygiene practice(ii)Wearing surgical mask at all times in patient-care area and compliance on cough etiquette(iii)Regular environmental cleaning with soap and water and ad-hoc environment cleaning with disinfectant (sodium hypochlorite 500 ppm) upon identification of confirmed case of S-OIV\n3.Early recognition of index case in the hospitalised patients(i)Triage of suspected patients in emergency room and admission to isolation facilities(ii)Alertness of patients with nosocomial onset of upper respiratory tract infection and referral to isolation facilities(iii)Implementation of rapid molecular diagnostic test with turnaround time within 24 h\n4.Preventing introduction of index case to the hospitalised patients(i)Promoting absenteeism for sick healthcare workers(ii)7-day sick leave for infected healthcare workers(iii)Wearing surgical mask for visitors in the hospital and promoting direct observed hand hygiene for visitors\n5.Audit of infection control compliance(i)Unobtrusive hand hygiene observation and monitoring the compliance of wearing surgical mask(ii)Monitoring the consumption of alcohol-based hand rub in the hospital(iii)Monitoring the incidence of nosocomial influenza A infection\n6.Administrative support(i)Provision of alcohol-based hand rub in every bed, all ward entrances and corridors(ii)Provision of manpower and equipment for laboratory diagnostics and contact tracing(iii)Co-ordination of infection control training sessions for staff\n\n",

Close contacts of the confirmed cases were quarantined. Close contacts were defined as individuals from the same household and flight passengers seated three rows in front or behind the confirmed cases. In phase 2, the early mitigation phase (from 18 June to 28 June 2009), all patients with laboratory-confirmed S-OIV were hospitalised for cohort nursing and consideration of antiviral therapy. During phase 3, the late mitigation phase (from 29 June 2009 onwards), only high risk patients (children aged \u22642 years or pregnant women) with S-OIV, and patients with clinical evidence of complicated influenza were admitted for further management.",

For those patients diagnosed in the general wards, patients staying in the same cubicle and HCWs working in the same wards were subjected to contact tracing and underwent a seven-day medical surveillance which included daily monitoring of body temperature and URTI symptoms by the ward-in-charge and infection control team. If the patients or HCWs had unprotected exposure, oseltamivir (75 mg daily for 10 days) would be offered as post-exposure prophylaxis. For those with protected exposure, no oseltamivir was given. When S-OIV was confirmed in HCWs, a seven-day sick leave would be issued. The infection control team would follow up on the clinical progress of the staff, investigate the source of infection and classify it as community- or hospital-acquired infection. Contact tracing of the exposed inpatients and co-workers was followed by a seven-day medical surveillance. If the infected HCW had worn a surgical mask and practice hand hygiene during patient care, antiviral agent would not be prescribed to the exposed patients. However, oseltamivir (75 mg daily for 10 days) would be recommended to the co-workers as post-exposure prophylaxis if they had not worn a surgical mask during tea break, lunch, and dinner with the infected staff. The infected HCWs were interviewed by the infection control team for compliance with infection control practice according to a standard questionnaire. Risk factors for nosocomial infection by S-OIV in both patients and HCWs were investigated. Persons exposed to the same environment who were asymptomatic for URTI after seven days of medical surveillance were chosen as control.",

Along with the basic and special infection control training sessions previously held before the outbreak of S-OIV, 4618 (92.8%) of the hospital staff have attended infection control training in the past 18 months. Video demonstrations of gowning and degowning of personal protective equipment were provided to all isolation wards and uploaded to the hospital intranet for regular revision by frontline HCWs.
