Facing the threat posed by COVID-19, members of the OSCOP announced on Monday, March 9, 2020, a webinar \u201cto facilitate a conversation around best practices for using the Omaha System to support COVID-19 disease prevention and control activities and documentation at the individual, family, and community levels. Evidence-based guidelines will be shared that will enable local and state public health agencies to disseminate best practices in software and to generate consistent data regarding COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and responses. Your participation is critical to ensure the guidelines reflect your perspective.\u201d Approximately 130 public health experts and others registered for the webinar.

One day after WHO's COVID-19 pandemic announcement, the OSCOP published the evidence-based guideline online at Omaha System Guidelines10 to support the international COVID-19 Response as a clinical decision support reference and documentation tool. Following our standard guidelines dissemination process, the COVID-19 guideline was dual encoded with SNOMED Clinical Terms (CT) and Omaha System codes for ease of incorporation within any electronic health record.11\u201313 We documented metadata detailing our process and contributors and posted it online together with the webinar recording and the guideline itself.",
