            "text": "On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The causative pathogen was suspected to be a virus,\nbut it did not match any other known virus. The following day, Wuhan City officials closed the Huanan seafood market, suspected to be the source of the mystery pathogen, because it was\nreported that certain patients presenting with the symptoms were vendors at that public market. By January 4 2020, the Chinese Health Organization reported 44 active cases. On 7 January\n2020, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified the causative agent as a novel Coronavirus (CoV). That family includes viruses of the common cold as well as viruses known to\ncause Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS); Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).The new CoV was named Novel Coronavirus (emerged late) 2019 (2019-nCoV). Two days later, Chinese\nauthorities reported the first fatality linked to 2019-nCoV: a 61-year-old male who had been admitted in the first cohort of patients. He had several other underlying medical conditions,\nwhich may have contributed to weakening his immune system. Apart from respiratory failure and severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, the patient suffered from abdominal tumors and chronic\nliver disease. On 12 January, Chinese scientists released the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV, in part because nonofficial report of international spread of 2019-nCoV had commenced. The next\nday, Thailand officially reported its first imported case of 2019-nCoV: a 61-year-old woman from Wuhan \u2013 she, however, denied having visited the Huanan seafood market. On January 15 2020,\nChinese authorities reported the second death attributed to 2019-nCoV: a 69-year-old male who also suffered of other unrelated severe pathologies, including myocarditis. Infection with\n2019-nCov, nonetheless, were thought to be responsible for his abnormal renal function, and severely damaged to multiple organ functions. The following day, Japan reported its first case\nof 2019-nCoV: a Chinese man in his 30s, who also denied having visited the Huanan market. On January 17, Thailand confirmed the second imported case of 2019-nCoV. Chinese authorities noted\na spike in 2019-nCoV infections between January 18 and 19, 2020. That observation arose the suspicion that 2019-nCoV was capable of direct human-to-human transmission. The following day,\n20 January 2020, South Korea confirmed its first case of 2019-nCoV infection: a male patient who denied having visited any public markets in Wuhan. On January 21 2020, the World Health\nOrganization confirmed human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCov. As of that date, the total official number of cases has risen to 222, although it was suspected to be in reality much higher.\nInfection had spread to health-care workers, and it was suspected that one mode of transmission may be via the eye mucosa. Chinese authorities have also reported a fourth death. The situation\nwas fast becoming alarming: suspected cases appeared in France, Italy and other countries of Europe.Australia seems to be affected as well.Other countries in Asia also reported suspected\ncases, including the Philippines and Singapore. Suspected cases of 2019-nCoV were reported in North America. The following day, 22 January 2020, World Health Organization Director-General\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus convened an emergency meeting to decide whether 2019-nCoV should be declared to constitute a worldwide public health emergency of international concern.Despite\na significant rise in confirmed cases of individuals infected with 2019-nCoV \u2013 in China alone, at 580 infected individuals, with a death toll now at 17 in the Hubei Province alone - the\nemergency committee deferred its decision on whether to advise Director-General Ghebreyesus to declare the 2019-nCoV outbreak a public health emergency pandemic of international concern.\nOn January 23, Chinese authorities shut down the city of Wuhan: no public transportation, closed airport and railway station for 11 million people. Later that same day, the city of Ezhou\nis also in complete lockdown. Festivities for the upcoming Chinese New Year were cancelled throughout China to minimize human contact in crowds.",

On January 24 2020, the official number of confirmed cases of patients infected with 2019-nCoV\nhad risen to 830 in China alone, with 177 (21%) among them in severe and critical condition. The number of fatalities caused by 2019-nCoV in China was now 25. Japan confirmed its second\n2019-nCoV case. Nepal confirmed its first case. The following day, Australia confirmed its first case of 2019-nCoV, as did France. Two suspected cases in Italy were being closely monitored.\nIn China, the official number of new infections \u2013 that is, over the previous 24 h \u2013 was 444, and the number of new deaths was 16 above and beyond the number reported the previous day.

Infection\nwith 2019-nCoV is now fast spreading across continents. At least two new cases have been reported and confirmed in the United States. And it has just been one month yet since the first\nalert. The causative agent for this alarming unfolding of events, 2019-nCoV, is a corona virus related to the viruses that have caused important outbreaks in the past, including the Middle-East\nRespiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [1].There is no first-second-or third-generation vaccine available for\nany members of the Cov family, nor is there practically the time to develop, raise, test and evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine for 2019-nCov. Moreover, the World Health Organization\nstated in its 12 January 2020 recommendations entitled \u2018Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected - Interim guidance;\nWHO/nCoV/Clinical/2020.1' that \"...there is no current evidence from RCTs to recommend any specific anti-nCoV treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed nCoV\u2026\".

In humans, the virus causes respiratory infections, which are generally often mild, rarely lethal. The\ntrends we begin to observe with 2019-nCov suggest that it can be directly transmitted human-to-human, and that it causes serious infections in roughly one in five patients that can\nlead to death: staggering preliminary statistics. Previous research with other CoV members indicates that proteins of Coronaviruses that could be used in the generation of vaccines\ninclude the spike, the envelope, the membrane and the nucleocapsid proteins. The spike protein is of particular interest because it is responsible for the penetration of the virus\ninto the cell, which leads to the initiation of viral replication and proliferation. The spike protein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transmembrane - receptor on\nthe eukaryotic host cell. Case in point, SARS-CoV binds to ACE2, as does MERS-CoV [2]. Indeed, ACE2 is the obligate cellular receptor for CoV\nentry process via the spike protein [3].",

Here, we propose that one putative 4th generation vaccine to control 2019-nCoV explosion might simply involve the genetic\nengineering a soluble binary molecule (i.e., ACE2R-ACE2R; [ACE2R] 2) or its quaternary form (i.e. two intertwined ACE2R-ACE2R; [ACE2R] 4). This process is fast, reliable and precise\nby today's standard, and doable in any modern biochemistry laboratory. The obtained sterile molecule could be injected in individuals at high risk as a preventive 4th vaccination measure,\nor as a treatment intervention in confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection. The soluble molecule is expected to bind the spike protein of circulating CoV with higher affinity than the\ntransmembrane ACE2R, and to render the CoV particles, therefore, incapable of binding to the cell receptor, of penetration into the cells, and of replicating inside the cell. The\nproposed 4th generation vaccine would, besides protecting the cells from CoV infection, also preserve ACE2 intracellular functional activity, and guard against the rise of serum\nangiotensin II levels, which can be pathogenic to lung cell integrity. In brief, the 4th generation vaccine proposed here would prevent at-risk individuals from becoming sick from any\nincipient infection: that is, in the true meaning of the term, it would 'vaccinate' them against CoV in general, and in the present case of high emergency provide substantial protection\nagainst2019-nCoV. Moreover, should the molecule be genetically engineered to incorporate a neutral protein, such as human serum albumin, the soluble albumin-[ACE2R] 2 or albumin-[ACE2R]\n4 complex injected in 2019-nCoV-infected patients would bind the circulating CoV. Patients could then undergo a treatment intervention of 'cleaning' their blood from albumin- [ACE2R]\nn-CoV complexes by a clinical protocol akin to dialysis. The patient's blood would be passed through a sterile column constructed with high affinity anti-human albumin antibodies. The\nanti-albumin antibody-albumin- [ACE2R] n-CoV moieties would be retained on the column, and the 'CoV-cleaned\u2019 blood returned to the patient to dampen the infection. It is possible that\nthe binding of CoV spike protein to ACE2 is a down regulation of its expression, resulting in increased serum angiotensin II levels, and lung injury. Indeed, administration of recombinant\nhuman ACE2 in experimental models of CoV infection ameliorates lung injury in animal models [4]. Therefore, we propose that the 'CoV-cleaned' blood\nreturned to the patient would also be enriched with recombinant human ACE2 to ameliorate lung injury.",

By contrast 3rd generation vaccines are vaccines derived from administration of genetically\nengineered DNA or mRNA to induce the host cells to produce an antigen in vivo, which in turn is expected to be recognized as non-self, and generate protective antibodies [5].\nHere, we propose a new avenue in vaccinology: the generation of a molecule with the purpose of preventing infectious disease - that is, a vaccine -, but not based on the traditional norms\nof antigen-idiotype binding. The 4th generation vaccine we theorize here depends upon the specificity of receptor-ligand binding, but is a biochemical molecule constructed artificially\nfor the purpose and intent of neutralizing the infectious agent.CoV in general, and 2019-nCov may not escape immune surveillance as other viruses often do [6-\n8]. Nonetheless, it follows that raising a 1st or 2nd generation vaccine against the CoV spike protein could be considered a viable protocol in the\ndevelopment of preventive measures to counter CoV-induced epidemics and pandemics. But the timeline to generate and test such vaccine species in the present emergency of the 2019-nCoV\npandemic is be prohibitive, as it would also be should we witness a contemporary resurgence of the SARS or MERS epidemic. Moreover, the utility of live-attenuated vaccines CoV is limited\nby risks of reversion or repair [8]. Alternative 3rd generation CoV vaccines may be theoretically promising in that CoV with completely rewired\ntranscription regulatory networks (TRNs) are effective vaccines against SARS-CoV, and putatively MERS-CoV. TRN-rewired CoV are attenuated and protect against lethal SARS-CoV challenge\n[9].TRN-rewired CoV are neither, properly speaking, 1st or 2nd generation vaccine, and neither are they 3rd generation vaccines:they are efficacious\nhybrid measures that prevent or slow down SARS-CoV, and possibly MERS-CoV epidemic. However, the urgency of the present moment precludes the somewhat lengthy experimentation time that would\nbe required for the development and testing of a 3rd generation vaccine of the sort. Since scientists have had several issues up to this point in the process of producing a 3rd generation\nvaccine for SARS or MERS, whose epidemics were several years ago, it implausible that they could now develop such a 3rd generation vaccine for 2019-nCov in the emergency the world is\nexperiencing today.",

These 4th generation vaccines\nmay be particularly relevant in the case of flaming epidemics, when the time to generate, test, evaluate and distribute 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation vaccines is prohibitive, such as is precisely\nthe case now with 2019-nCoV. In certain circumstances, public health urgency demands immediate intervention, and precludes the time required to generate and test new vaccine species.Case\nin point, the threat now posed by the new member of the Coronavirus family (2019-nConV), whose discovery was announced by the Chinese health authorities on Chinese authorities reported having\nisolated a new type of coronavirus on 7 January 2020. Whereas 2019-nCoV is reported to a beta coronavirus closely related to SARS and other coronaviruses that originate from bats, it is\nunclear \u2013 and at this point almost irrelevant - to date if 2019-nConV originated from bats or from snake or other animals and subsequently transferred to bats. What is clear is that 2019-nConV\nis capable of direct human-to-human transmission, and its infection patterns grows alarmingly fast across all continents. To be clear, three weeks into its original reporting, 2019-nCoV\nhas infected children, men, women and elderly in all continents. In China alone, the number of confirmed cases are over thirty-seven thousand infected individuals (n=37,593 as of day 21),\nand the number of fatalities from the disease has risen over eight hundred (n=813).Whereas both the percent confirmed cases and the percent death rate seem to have steadily decreased in\nparallel over the past 21 days, the case-fatality percent rate has remained steady above 2% (mean \u00b1 SD: 2.34% \u00b1 0.39) (Figure 1). As\na reference point, the case-fatality percent rate of the Spanish influenza following World War I worldwide was at, or slightly above 2.5%; that same statistic for measles with no preventive\nvaccination measures is close 15%.",

Thus, vaccine protocols that do not\ninvolve the generation of antibodies against whole pathogens uses protein extracts obtained from pathogens, or nucleic acids related to pathogens. Rather, the preventive and protecting\nability of the intervention we propose, which still relies on the specific binding of the pathogen to a substrate generated specifically against it, is a biochemical construct, which\ncould actually best be generated by artificial intelligence of immune surveillance [8] algorithms in the not so distant future. The construct we\npropose here, specific to CoV, and applicable to 2019-nCoV in the context of the immediate urgency that is upon us, can be generated and expanded quickly, simply and reliably in any\nbiochemistry laboratory. We also describe how it can be effectively utilized in treatment protocols of patients already infected with 2019-nCoV, in a slight modification of the common\nclinical protocol for renal dialysis.",
