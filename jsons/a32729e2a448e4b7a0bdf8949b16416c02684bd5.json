We show that both networks exhibit striking statistical similarities despite significant differences in topology and connectivity. Both networks exhibit a discontinuity in node and link betweenness distributions which implies that these networks naturally segragate in two different classes of nodes and links. We introduce a technique based on effective distances, shortest paths and shortest-path trees for strongly weighted symmetric networks and show that in a shortestpath-tree representation the most significant features of both networks can be readily seen. We show that effective shortest-path distance, unlike conventional geographic distance measures, strongly correlates with node centrality measures. Using the new technique we show that network resilience can be investigated more precisely than with contemporary techniques that are based on percolation theory. We extract a functional relationship between node characteristics and resilience to network disruption. Finally we discuss the results, their implications and conclude that dynamic processes that evolve on both networks are expected to share universal dynamic characteristics.",

            "text": "Although they are immensely important for facilitating exchange between geographically distant regions, the ever-increasing amount of traffic over such complex, densely-connected transportation networks introduces serious problems. Rising energy costs, pollution, and global warming are obvious concerns, but globalized traffic also plays a key role in the worldwide dissemination of infectious diseases and invasive species [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The first decade of the 21st century has witnessed the emergence and worldwide spread of two major global epidemics: the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [20] [21] [22] [23] , and the recent H1N1 pandemic of 2009 [24, 25] . Both diseases rapidly spread across the globe in a matter of weeks to months, a process linked directly to long-distance traffic routes over which infected individuals dispersed infectious agents. In combination with increasing worldwide population size, which is expected to pass the 7 billion threshold within the next decade, and the concentration of the majority of the world's population in mega-cities and urban areas [26] , the impact of global pandemic events is expected to become one of the most challenging problems of the 21st century. The spread of invasive species into new habitats and ecosystems presents a similar and equally-significant problem [17, [27] [28] [29] . The largest vector of marine bioinvasion is assumed to be global shipping [30] .",

For instance, the unexpected eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull in 2010 and subsequent closure of major European airports led to a major disruption in global traffic and significant economic stress over a period of several days. Other influences, such as meteorological events like hurricanes, the recent rise in acts of piracy in Somalia, or the financial crisis of 2007 also make flexibility in worldwide cargo traffic necessary and underline the vulnerabilty of international trade and transportation systems. It is therefore of fundamental importance to understand the resilience of these networks in response to regional and large-scale failure of parts of the network, and to identify \"sensitive\" regions of the network. This point becomes even more important in light of malicious terrorist activities.",

Computational techniques for investigating the resilience of these networks in the face of partial failure will play a fundamental part in achieving this understanding; complex network theory [34] already provides a powerful theoretical tool in this respect. But, although both the worldwide air transportation network and the global cargo ship network have already been subjected to a number of network-theoretic analyses [6, 9, 21, 35, 36] , it is still unclear whether the observed properties of these networks are unique to a specific context, or are universal and generic.

Among other things, this implies that the shortest topological path between two nodes may not be the path of strongest interaction, and we account for such effects by using the idea of effective shortest paths. These are analogous to the well-known topological shortest paths, except that the length of an edge is taken to be the reciprocal of the weight of that edge, and the effective shortest path is then the path that minimizes the total effective distance.

A random (failure) or selected (attack) fraction q of nodes is removed from the network and structural responses of the network are investigated as a function of q. Important insight was gained in studies that investigated random or selected node removal in random networks [43] [44] [45] [46] . One of the most important findings of these studies was that scale-free networks with power-law degree distributions respond strikingly differently in scenarios that reflect random failures as opposed to selected removal of central nodes. For instance, scale-free networks are relatively immune to random removal of nodes and extremely sensitive to targeted removal of high centrality nodes. Since centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and flux typically correlate in these networks, this effectively amounts to removal of nodes that function as hubs. One of the essential questions in this context addresses the critical fraction q of removed nodes that are required to disintegrate the global connectivity of the network. This critical value is the percolation threshold q c : for q < q c the size of the giant component (the largest subset of nodes that are connected by paths) is typically the size of the entire network. Beyond the percolation threshold (q > q c ) the networks falls apart into a family of disconnected, fragmented sub-networks.",

The WAN exhibits a percolation threshold at q c N = 13.8%, 17.2% and 9.4%, for node removal according to degree, flux and betweenness. The thresholds are significantly larger for the GCSN at q c N = 44.3%, 49.0% and 39.5%.

However, due to the strong nonlinear relationship between q N and q F it is evident that both networks are strongly resilient to targeted attacks. Even substantial traffic reduction has virtually no impact on the relative size of the giant component, for instance when 50% of the entire traffic is reduced in both networks, the giant component is still larger than 90% of the original network and no percolation threshold is observed in the range up to 80% of traffic reduction.

Another approach that has been applied in unweighted networks [45] is based on the diameter of the network and its response to network disruption. Typically when high-centrality nodes are removed from the network, the diameter of the network increases as the shortest paths connecting two arbitrary nodes lengthen due to the increasing lack of hubs that can serve as connecting junctions. Figure 5d shows that this inflation of the network in response to node removal is observed in both networks. This effect is relatively independent of the choice of centrality measure used in the removal protocol. Furthermore, the GCSN is more robust to node reduction, which we believe to be a consequence of the high connectivity of the network.",

In section IV we propose a technique to quantify network resilience that permits the study of network pertubations in a more refined framework and well below the percolation threshold based on shortest-path trees. The key idea behind this technique is the ability to quantify the effect of network disruptions for each node and perform network-wide statistics of the impact of external pertubations or network disruptions. links although they may be geographically close.

This impact factor is different for every node and the distribution p(\u03be) gives insight into the variability of how individual nodes are affected by the network disruption [47] . Figure 9a illustrates p(\u03be) for scenarios in which the entire traffic was reduced by 30% through the removal of high-centrality nodes. The distribution p(\u03be) is independent of the measure of centrality and also identical in both networks. Below a typical impact of \u03be 0 the distribution of impact factors p(\u03be) is uniform and for \u03be > \u03be 0 it decreases slowly, ranging over many orders of magnitude. A question that immediately arises is what nodes in the network experience the largest impact. is of intermediate size as they primarily connect to hubs in the network by strong links. When the hubs are removed from the network, these nodes experience a strong increase in impact as \u2206d is increased substantially. A similar effect is seen in the behavior of \u2329\u03be\u232a as a function of degree k.",

The percolation threshold for both networks lies well beyond any realistic network pertubations. The alternative approach based on effective distance, shortest paths, and shortest-path trees allows a better, more intuitive representation of networks and resilience analysis, taking into account the fact that nodes that are connected by strong traffic are effectively closer than nodes that are connected by weak links and investigating network pertubations from the viewpoint of chosen reference nodes. Furthermore, the shortest-path-tree representation revealed an interesting correlation of effective shortest path distance and node centrality measures such as flux, degree, and betweenness and an interesting symmetry in both networks: On average, any node in the network is closest to the subset of nodes with high centrality. This has fundamental implications for spreading phenomena on these types of networks. Whereas global disease dynamics, for example, is characterized by highly complex 20 spatio-temporal patterns when visualized in conventional geographical coordinates, we expect these patterns become simpler and thus better understood when shortest-path-tree representations are employed. Since the shortest-path-tree representations are structurally similar in both networks one might expect a strong dynamic similarity of otherwise unrelated spreading phenomena that occur in these networks, for example the global spread of emergent human infectious diseases on the worldwide airtransportation network and human mediated bioinvasion processes on the global cargoship network.",

Numerical values of the percolation thresholds are given in the text. c) The largest component as a function of fraction of removed traffic does not exhibit a clear percolation threshold even when almost all the traffic is removed. This indicates that the integrity of the entire network is not altered substantially even if an unrealistically large amount of traffic is reduced. d) The response to selected node removal as reflected in network inflation.

NETWORK SHORTEST-PATH TREESGlobal properties of strongly heterogeneous, multi-scale networks, such as connectivity, clustering coefficient, and diameter, as well as statistical distributions of centrality measures, provide important insight and may serve as quantitative classifiers for networks. However, they cannot resolve properties and structures on a local scale. On the other hand, local measures such as a node's individual degree, betweenness centrality, or mean link weight of its connections provide local information only and cannot capture global properties. Transportation networks exhibit important structure on intermediate scales, so it is vital to understand structural properties that are neither local nor global in these networks. One way to approach this is to analyse and investigate the structure of the entire network from the perspective of a chosen node. Clearly, geographic distance is an important parameter in this context as operation costs typically scale with geographic distance. However, in complex multi-scale transportation networks such as the WAN and the GCSN, geographic distance is rarely a good indicator of the effective distance of connected nodes. High-flux hubs in each network are typically connected by strong traffic bonds even across very large geographic distances while smaller-flux nodes can be connected by weak Shortest-path tree structures and effective distances in WAN and GCSN. Left: The panels depict the shortest-path trees of airports ATL (Atlanta) and PVG (Shanghai). The radial distance of the remaining airports with respect to these root nodes represent the logarithm of the shortest-path distance to the reference node. Right:The panels depict the GCSN shortest-path tree for ports Wilhelmshaven, Germany and Shanghai. Note that theoverall structure of both representations is different, yet both networks share the feature of circular arrangement according to node flux, encoded by color (blue represents large flux nodes and orange small node flux). Note that irrespective of the chosen root node, the closest nodes in terms of effective distance are always high flux nodes and small flux nodes are always peripheral in this representation. Shortest-path distance statistics. a: Conditional mean shortest path (Eq. 11) as a function of node flux as well as the conditional coefficient of variation in shortest paths. Both networks exhibit a universal decrease of expected shortest path with node flux determined by an exponent \u03c4 \u2248 0.75, see Eq. 12. The variability of shortestpath distance increases in both networks, but less markedly in the GCSN than in the WAN. b: The conditional distributions of shortest paths for four subtypes of root nodes (WAN) ranked according to flux, where red markers denote high flux and light blue denote low flux. c: Same as in b for the GCSN.
