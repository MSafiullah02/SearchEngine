            "text": "At present, the patient care delivery system (PCDS) in a hospital/medical institute/clinic is absolutely medical technologydependent and this tendency is found to increase day by day. To ensure the quality of patient care (QPC) appropriate implementation of the patient care technology management system (PCTMS) is necessary. Unfortunately, it is found to be absent in the healthcare delivery system in most of the countries in the world. The situation is very much severe, particularly, in medium-and low-income countries like Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, etc. The opposite scenario is found in high-income countries, specifically, in Japan where QPC has been improved significantly by adopting the clinical engineering approach (CEA) in their PCDS. Up to now, QPC is determined based on prediction as there are no mathematical ways to evaluate it properly. In this study, we for the first time, propose a mathematical model to evaluate the QPC quantitatively based on feedback control analogy taking into account of CEA in PCTMS, particularly, for clinical and surgical equipment. The model consists of three subsections: the clinical engineering department (CED), PCTMS, and health care engineering directorate (HCED). The correlation among the subsections and their performance parameters are defined and standardized. Multiple linear regression method is applied to derive the least square normal equations for each of the subsections and then the regression coefficients are solved by the standard data taken from 1000 beds hospitals of different countries. The model is applied to reveal the present status of QPC for 18 different countries including high-, middle-, and low-income countries of the world. The results obtained from the model demonstrate that the present status of QPC in Japan is 84.69% and in Pakistan, it is only 0.20%. This huge discrepancy is identified to be caused by the inclusion of CEA in PCDS of Japan. The proposed model can be applied to evaluate the QPC of a hospital/in a country and hence to take necessary steps accordingly for establishing the proposed research methodology. It is to be mentioned here that the proposed model cannot be applied to evaluate the QPC in some countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, etc. due to the unavailability of data related to the model parameters.",

            "text": "Nowadays, the quality of the patient care delivery system (PCDS), particularly, disease diagnosis and treatment are mostly medical device-dependent [1] . In the meantime, the development of patient care delivery is found significant in different countries [2] . However, the quality of patient care (QPC) allied with the performance outcomes of medical and surgical equipment has not been explored yet in detail [3] . The patients' satisfaction absolutely depends on the QPC and can be achieved by reduction of risk factors (patient injuries, unnatural patients' deaths, etc.) caused by medical and surgical equipment under medical conditions [2, 4] . The risk factors associated with medical devices are studied by Hossain et al. [5] . It is found that the patients' risk factors can be reduced by applying engineering and managerial skills to healthcare technology by means of clinical engineering approach (CEA) [5, 6] . In this study, the performance of patient care is investigated in terms of the performance outcomes of healthcare technology considering its five key parameters that is why the term health technology management system can be used as a patient care technology management system (PCTMS) [7] . It is noted that high-income countries like Japan, Belgium, America, etc., already adopted CEA in their patient care technology management system (PCTMS). Consequently, patient safety and effective care of these countries are found to improve significantly than that of many upper-middle and lowermiddle-income countries like Malaysia, South Africa, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, etc. [8, 9] . The PCDS of developing countries are found inferior from a study conducted by Hossain et al. [5] . In this study, the role of clinical engineers for improving the health care technology management system is pointed out. It is well established that without CEA in PCTMS it is not possible to improve QPC.",

Here, we have proposed a cost-effective model for CED as well as for HCED which will act as a regulatory authority of PCTMS. The performance parameters of each subsection are defined and their characteristics are explained. Using multiple linear regression equations, the standard performance equations of CED (G P ), PCTMS (A P ) and HCED (A F ) are proposed and then least-square normal equations are derived. The regression coefficients of these equations are solved by using the standard data collected from 1000 beds in modern hospitals having different types of medical equipment users departments [9, 10] . The model is applied to evaluate the QPC of different countries with CEDs and without CEDs. The results obtained from the model clearly demonstrate that the QPC of the countries where the appropriate implementation of PCTMS is performed by CEDs found to be at a satisfactory level, that is, in case of Japan, it is 84.69%. On the other hand, it is found to be at a marginal level, that is, 53.14% and 52.10%, respectively, for Slovene (SVN) and Belgium (BEL). For some countries like India, Pakistan, Jordan, South Africa, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, etc. the value of QPC is very poor and even it is not possible to evaluate the QPC for some countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri-Lanka due to unavailability of model data in their hospitals [8, 11] .",

But, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) mentioned that the components of quality-care can be defined on the conceptual components rather than the measured indicators, that is, it must be safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. Thus safety is the foundation upon which all other aspects of quality-care are built [1, 12, 13] . Since our main objective is to ensure patient safety, it is considered as a key parameter to evaluate the QPC. The patient safety, on the other hand, depends on the appropriate application of PCTMS, that is, on the performance outcomes of medical and surgical equipment. According to the definition of IOM, patient safety is the prevention of harm to patients [6, 14] . In the patient safety network website, the Agencies for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) have defined the term \"prevention of harm\" as \"freedom from accidental or preventable injuries produced by medical care\" [6] . From the above statements, it is cleared that the prevention of harm to patients' is the reduction of risk factors related to medical and surgical equipment.",

This can be done by introducing CEA in PCTMS, that is, with the quality outcome of the CED model [11] . Standard clinical equipment management coefficients depend on the preventive maintenance (PM) score, risk score, and functionality score of medical and surgical equipment that are used for ensuring the quality of patient care. These scores are medical equipment dependent. A common formula is used in previous studies [11, 15] to define the maximum score for different types of medical equipment that have been actively used for patient care. In this study, we consider 10 numbers of equipment including four categories (diagnostic, therapeutic, life recovery and monitoring). As an example, the maximum management coefficient score of a cardiac defibrillator is 20 and the safe score is 16 [15] . When this score goes above 16, it is required to perform the performance evaluation test of this equipment every six months' interval as PM for achieving the safety and timely outcomes from PCTMS [15] . However, these outcomes are highly dependent on the performance outcome of CED [11, 16] . Applying PM methodologies, the risk factors of equipment can be minimized and thus patient safety can be ensured. So the quality outcomes of CED are strongly dependent on the appropriate number of skilled staffs of CED model, which depends on the numbers of medical equipment, complexity of equipment, and the intensity of medical equipment technology ability in a modern hospital [11, 16, 17] , that is, on the workload of the hospital. The number of skilled staff in the CED of a hospital absolutely depends on the number of medical and surgical equipment rather than the patient's capacity of a hospital [9, 11, 13] . Here we have considered manpower setup for the CED of different level of hospitals (1000-1500beds) having 108 to 325 staffs with the following designations: Director clinical engineering (DCE), Senior clinical engineer (Sr. CE), Assistant clinical engineer (ACE), Clinical engineering technologist (CET), and Biomedical equipment technician (BMET) [9, 18] to ensure 24 h services. It is to be noted that the skills of staff are determined by some core indicators such as educational qualification, CE certification, training, and duration of working experiences in this field [18, 19].",

The regulatory authority formed by highly skilled clinical engineers such as Chief CE, Principle CE, Senior CE, and Basic grade CE [18] [19] .

These include (i) a chief clinical engineer (CCE), (ii) a director of clinical engineering (DCE), (iii) a clinical engineering manager (CEM), and (iv) a senior clinical engineer (Sr. CE). The number of staff in HCED depends on the workload, that is, the total number of modern hospitals in a country/the total number of medical and surgical equipment/the total numbers of staff in different CEDs under the healthcare system of a country [8] [9] [23] [24] .

For improving QPC medical devices must be safe, functional, and timely interfaced with the patient, which can be ensured by duly implementation of PCTMS through CED in a hospital. Based on patient satisfaction level, a regulatory authority, herein HCED, must provide necessary inputs to CED so that QPC can be achieved up to the desired level. These work sequences are presented in Fig.  1 and can be expressed by feedback control theory according to the block diagram shown in Fig. 2 [11, 26] . From Fig. 2 , we developed a mathematical model whose performance parameters are represented by A P , G P , and A F to express the performances of PCTMS, CED, and HCED, respectively. Here, we also represented input and output performances of CED (A p ) Fig. 1 Concept of the patient-care system considering CEA in PCTMS by A I and A 0 and for the PCTMS (G P ), the same is represented by A 0 and C p . Here, F 0 is the output performance of HCED (A F ) and it can be considered as a feedback factor that regulates reference input as well as the input of PCTMS. Moreover, R P is the desired expectation of a patient, which is set as the input of the proposed system and C p is the actual output of the system. The QPC, that is, the satisfaction level of a patient depends on C p . Applying closed-loop transfer function, the performance of the proposed system shown in Fig. 2 can be represented by Eq. (1).",

This is clearly understood from the scores of E CEMC along with E F , E R , and E PM of different medical devices listed in Table 5 and Table 6 under unsafe and safe conditions, respectively. The details are shown in Tables 1, 2 , and 3 respectively. It is found that the standard safe E CEMC score is less than 16 and it is considered as the highest set-point under patient safety care condition. It is necessary to ensure the performance evaluation test for every six-month interval when this score becomes more than 15. This can be duly implemented by applying clinical engineering methodologies by CED whose responsibility is to develop and maintain a schedule of preventive maintenance (PM) and do it timely. Thus, patient risk factors such as patient injury and unnatural death related to medical and surgical equipment can be reduced significantly. The performance evaluation test and audit belong to the PM, inspection and appetence test. Additionally, incorrect operation and instant failures of medical and surgical equipment are serious causes for unusual patient injury as well as unnatural death of patients during care conditions.",

Continuous monitoring of G P performance could be a better way for understanding and identifying the real causes of performance degradation and thereby necessary actions can be taken promptly for improving it. There is no standard method to evaluate the performance of G P as reported so far [11] . Different engineering methodologies are normally used in different countries [21] . The conventional methodology is commonly used in lower-middle-income countries like Bangladesh, in which the staffs' positions, as well as their numbers, are selected without taking into account of workload. That is, not on the basis of the number of medical and surgical equipment and the amount of medical equipment technology ability of different hospitals. As a result, the performance of G P is not at a satisfying level. It is well established that the performance of G P is strongly dependent on the number of FETs. So, if a CED is formed with insufficient staffs the performance of G P will be lost; on the other hand; overstaffing will be very much expensive and time-consuming. In this study analytical method is used that is based on the data related to the performance of G P . In this method, skilled number staffs have been selected based-on workload of a hospital such as a number and complexity level of medical & surgical equipment as well as the intensity of medical equipment technology ability. In this method, data collection is convenient, fast, cost-effective, and suitable for need-based customization. For the calculation of skilled staffs in a CED, it is required to collect data for the proposed analytical method. We have presented necessary data that are collected from three hospitals including high-, upper-and lower-middleincome countries as an example. The list of hospitals along with data is shown in Table 7 .",

But, 2080 h in a year is the absolute calculation without considering holidays, vacation time, sick time, and so on. Taking into account these, the working hours for an FTE per year could be as low as 1680 h. So, additional FTEs are required for bearing a 400-h workload in the whole year and it is 23% of 1680 h, that is, the total number of employees will be 1.24 FTEs. In this study, FTE = 1.0 means full-time employee; while FTE = 0.5 is half-time/part-time employee.",

So, the total number of FTEs is about 67 (1.24 \u00d7 54) considering holidays and other leaves. According to [9, 24, 29] , the maximum and minimum numbers of FTEs for 1000-1200 beds hospital are about 67 and 32, respectively, and that depends on the number of clinical departments as well as the number of complexity of clinical equipment that has been used for patient care. It is found in [7] that the ratio among skilled staffs for quality CED model can be arranged as CE:CET:BMET = 1:2:3. So, the FTEs ratio will be CE:CET:BMET = 54:108:162 for 1000-1200 beds hospital. This rationalized means for 1000-1200 beds in modern hospitals with 14 different clinical departments to ensure 24 h support to the patient by applying clinical engineering management methodologies. These FTEs are considered for 24 h services, so for each shift with 8 h duration, it will be divided by 3, which is also supported by WHO reports [8] [9] . So, the ratio of FTEs per shift among CE, CET, and BMET can be presented as CE: CET: BMET = 18: 36: 54. The standard manpower setup of a CED for providing 24 h services can be represented in Fig. 3 on the basis of [8-9, 21, 29] . This rationalized means for 1000-1200 beds in modern hospitals with 14 different clinical departments to ensure 24 h support to the patient by applying clinical engineering management methodologies. These FTEs are considered for 24 h services, so for each shift with 8 h duration, it will be divided by 3, which is also supported by WHO reports [9] . So, the ratio of Table 9 . Figure 3 shows five distinct positions of staff for a CED and these are constant parameters and the number of staff of the respective positions is the variable parameters. The constant and variable parameters are listed in Table 9 . These parameters are very much important for standardizing the performance of G P . The score of the parameters depends on the workload such as the complexity of medical & surgical equipment and intensity of medical equipment technology and other Table 10 .",

According to the discussion of preceding sections patient care depends on many factors. Considering the variable parameters independent a statistical tool can be used that is capable of relating multiple independent variables to a dependent variable. This facilitates to predict standard performances of PCTMS, CED, and HCED, which are defined as G P , A P , and A F , respectively, in previous sections. The lists of constant and variable parameters related to the standard performance of G P , A P , and A F are mentioned in Tables 9, 11 , and 14. Since the variable parameters are independent and human engineering errors are involved with the parameters of G P , A P , and A F multiple linear regression analysis [10, 30, [31] [32] can be used for standardizing the performance of PCTMS, CED, and HCED.",

It is noted that the results presented here are evaluated by setting the on-time response indicator A F = 1 for each country for convenient evaluation. The results are listed in Table 16 and graphically presented in Fig. 4 . As seen in Fig. 4 and Table 16 the performance of PCDS is found to be 84.69% for Japan and it is the highest value among the countries studied here. The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that the performance of PCDS is found more than 45% for the countries like Slovene (SVN), Belgium (BEL) Ireland (IRL), etc. On the other hand, it is found to be very poor for countries like Finland (FIN), Israel (ISR), Austria (AUS), etc. The results presented here also demonstrate that the density of clinical engineer as well as the adaptation of CEA in PCTMS is the main factor to improve QPC for a particular country. In some countries, the performance of PCDS is found to be at a very unsatisfactory level, which may be due to the fact that they did not introduce CEA in their HCDS [8] [9] 11] . This implies that the model is able to explain the QPC of the countries where CEA has been introduced or not. Thus, the proposed model is universal and any country/hospital can easily evaluate the present status of QPC and then take necessary action accordingly. Our model related policies and procedures govern activities from selection and acquisition to incoming inspection and maintenance of medical equipment. The main goal of METMS is to ensure that the equipment used in patient care must be safe, available, accurate, and affordable [35] . Sometimes, METMS is known as the healthcare technology management system (HTMS). HTMS or METMS consists of 10 parameters and patient care is not actively related to 10 parameters [11, 16, 2, 33] . In this study, five core parameters of METMS or HTMS have selected to ensure the quality of patient and the integrated outcome of these five parameters can be defined as patient care technology management system (PCTMS) and this term has been revealed by many publications such as Jim Kline in [34] . (ii) Skilled Clinical Engineer's Approach: Although procedures vary from one field on inquiry to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of skilled clinical engineering method involves making hypotheses, deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions such as quality of CED models and their contributions for appropriate controlling of medical equipment technology outcome to ensure the patient safety [36] .",

He or she plays an important role in clinical practices such as cardiac operations, as well as in the education of medical doctors and nurses on the use of medical equipment. Accordingly, he or she is required to obtain medical knowledge and communication ability as a member of a medical practice team in addition to engineering skill\" [37] . (iv) Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET): \"A Biomedical Equipment Technician, also referred to as a Biomedical Engineering Technician is typically an electro-mechanical technician who ensures that medical equipment is well-maintained, properly configured, and safely functional. In the hospital or clinical environments, Biomedical Equipment Technicians often work with Clinical Engineers. Biomedical Equipment Technicians install, inspect, maintain, repair, calibrate, modify and design biomedical equipment and support systems to adhere to medical standard guidelines\" [38]. Engineering plays an important role beginning from the procurement process and facilitates effective management of medical devices which are especially used in health care facilities. Additionally, clinical engineering department increases the life cycle of medical devices, optimizes spare parts and technical services' costs of medical devices in order to improve the quality of health care. Accordingly, a quality model of CED can be defined as a set of characteristics such as constant and variable parameters and the relation between them that provide the basis for specifying quality requirements and evaluating the quality of an entity [39, 40] .

It is well established that patient satisfaction depends on quality-care and cost-effective-care that can be achieved by on-time interfacing of safe and functional medical devices to the patients. Without introducing CEA in PCDS it is impossible to interface safe and functional medical devices timely and safely. This is clearly identified from the analysis of the data collected from different hospitals of high, upper-middle, and lower-middleincome countries of the world. Although the patient's satisfaction level has been increased by some high-income countries like Japan, Belgium, Slovene, etc., by introducing CEA in their PCDS, there is no mathematical tool to evaluate QPC quantitatively. Here we have presented a mathematical model to evaluate the QPC quantitatively by introducing CEA in PCDS following the analogy of control theory. Different subsections of the models and their correlation with PCDS, FTEs required in a CED and their dependency with the number of beds of a hospital and MEUDs are also clarified. Furthermore, the characteristics of model parameters are defined and the technological weights of these parameters are proposed based on the standard data collected from different hospitals of the world. The performance equations of the model are standardized using the multiple linear regression method. Finally, the model is applied to reveal the present status of QPC in different 18 countries including high-middle-, and low-income countries. The results obtained from the model indicate that the impact of CEA in PCDS is very much significant and play a vital role to ensure the QPC of a country. The model can be applied to evaluate the QPC of a hospital or a country and it facilitates identifying which subsections of the model (CED/PCTMS/HCED) need to improve for ensuring QPC. The outcome of this study clearly explains the impact of clinical engineering professionals in PCTMS for ensuring QPC and hence to prevent medical equipment-dependent risk factors, that are related to different adverse events such as patient injuries, unnatural patient's death and reduction of healthcare cost, etc.",
