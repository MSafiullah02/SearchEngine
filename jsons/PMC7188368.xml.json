SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans from an intermediate host, civets and dromedary camels, respectively. Still, no source or intermediate host has been confirmed yet via genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis [2]. This hypothesis was made because previous coronavirus strains have originated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat [8]. However, Xiao et al reported the isolation and characterization of a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus from pangolins (Manis javanica) [9]. Similarly, in October 2019, a viral metagenomic study of pangolins identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-related sequences [10, 11]. According to the study by Xu et al, 60% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 had traveled to Wuhan or nearby regions (60%), 36% had close contact with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients and 4% had no definite exposure [12]. According to the study by Tian et al, 40.5% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 had traveled to Wuhan or nearby regions [13]. Beijing is the fourth most-affected city in China [13].",

As exact biological characteristics of COVID-19 are still not defined well, multiple sampling from multi-sites for the highly suspected population can be useful for COVID-19 detection at a much earlier stage [27]. Specimens should be tested for routine bacterial and viral infections, as well as using both upper and lower respiratory tract samples to test for SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Serological tests are in development, and they can be used if RT-PCR is not available [3]. As per the case reported by Chen et al, the oropharyngeal swab test of COVID-19 RNA turned positive even during the convalescence period in a confirmed case; it emphasizes the significance of active surveillance of COVID-19 RNA for inactivity assessment [28].",

            "text": "In a retrospective study done in Wuhan on 81 patients from December 20, 2019 to January 23, 2020, they were able to describe the characteristics of the chest CT at specified time points during the disease course. They have divided the patients into four different groups, as shown in Table 1 [30]. Based on the review, COVID-19 pneumonia is described radiographically as bilateral, subpleural ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms, ill-defined margins and slight predominance on the right lower lobe. It was also noted that the radiological evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia is consistent with the clinical course of the disease. Therefore, serial CT could help monitor disease progression. The study also pointed out that patients with old age, male and with underlying comorbidities as well as progressive radiographic deterioration on follow-up are the risks for poor prognosis [30]. According to Chen et al, the majority (75%) of patients had bilateral pneumonic changes on CT imaging [15]. Guan et al reported 230 out of 1,099 (20%) cases [31], and Chung et al reported three out of 21 (14%) have normal CT scans for patients diagnosed with symptoms along with confirmation of infection with RT-PCR [32]. According to a single-center study done by Chen et al in 99 patients, 75% of patients showed bilateral pneumonia, ARDS developed in 17% and 11% of them died with multi-organ failure [15].",

These lesions sometimes were accompanied by air bronchograms but rarely pleural effusions [12, 33]. Regarding lobar involvement, right lower lobe is most commonly involved in approximately 95% of cases followed by left lower lobe (88%), left upper lobe (80%) and right upper lobe (73%) [12].

Imai et al provided the first estimation of the reproduction factor, using R0 of 2.6 and based on the number of cases in China and those detected in other countries [57]. Other authors estimated R0 to be 3.813, 6.4714, 2.215 and 2.6816 [20]. According to Wang et al, the model used to calculate R0 was assumed of the model from Wuhan, China, as summarized in Table 6. The model used to calculate R0 assumed that there were no new transmissions from animals, no differences in individual immunity, the time-scale of the epidemic is much faster than specific times for demographic processes (natural birth and death), and there are no differences in natural births and deaths [20]. Assuming the epidemic continues to develop with R0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.19 from December 1, 2019, the number of infections will continue to rise. By the end of February 2020, COVID-19 cases would be 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989 in Wuhan, China with R0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.1, respectively [20]. According to Read\u2019s research, R0 for COVID-19 outbreak is much higher compared with other emergent coronaviruses [58]. We see a decreased trend in Rt as discussed in Table 6 with effective implementation of public health measures to control the spread of the disease.",

Several sequelae were seen including, coagulation activation, cellular immune deficiency, hepatic and kidney injury, secondary bacterial infection and myocardial injury. Lymphopenia and sustained inflammation seen in patients with severe disease and death are most likely secondary to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of COVID-19 due to previous exposure to other coronaviruses [30]. Especially this kind of pattern is also seen in patients who had SARS during an epidemic in 2003 [40].",

Unfortunately, knowledge about the novel virus is limited, causing lots of concern and panic. To decrease morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, public health and infection control measures are urgently required to limit the global spread of the virus. All efforts should be made to slow the spread of the illness in order to provide time for health care systems and the general public to prepare and to develop timely diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Finally, although the improvement of internet communication enhances information dissemination, it also has the potential to spread misinformation. Hence, we need to educate the public to follow information from a reliable website such as the CDC in the US. There are several unanswered questions at present in the management of COVID-19. Even though several case studies, RCTs and systemic reviews were done, there is no clarity regarding the exact pathogenesis of the disease, duration of shedding of virus and the possibility of other contaminant viral infections including influenza as well as secondary bacterial infections. The pandemics like COVID-19 put stress on every part of society, posing significant treat to international health and the economy. Several vaccines and promising treatments are being tested on clinical trials. However, the rising number of infected people, as well as mortality from it and the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 with a prolonged incubation period and asymptomatic carriers shredding the virus, makes it challenging to contain the spread. At present, handwashing, isolating and quarantine patients who are exposed or infected with the virus, disinfecting the contaminated surfaces as well as extensive public health measures such as avoiding large group meetings, closure of schools, restricting travel are being implemented by different countries to curb the spread of this virus. Hopefully, we develop an effective vaccine and treatment as soon as possible. Continued clinical trials are required to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 to tackle the disease better and to decrease morbidity and mortality.",
