            "text": "In southern Africa, the roots of Pelargonium sidoides have been used for centuries for the treatment of different aliments including infections of the airways (Conrad et al., 2007, Brendler and van Wyk, 2008, Kolodziej, 2008). In Germany, a standardised extract of Pelargonium sidoides (EPs\u00ae 7630) was registered in 2005 by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) for the indication \u201cacute bronchitis\u201d (Conrad et al. 2007). A couple of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials support the efficacy and safety of EPs\u00ae 7630 for the treatment of acute bronchitis in adults and children (Conrad et al., 2007, Agbabiaka et al., 2008, Matthys and Funk, 2008, Timmer et al., 2008, Kamin et al., 2010a, Kamin et al., 2010b, Matthys et al., 2010). The postulated mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of EPs\u00ae 7630 in bronchitis patients include immunomodulatory and cytoprotective effects, inhibition of interaction between bacteria and host cells, and increase of cilliary beat frequency on respiratory cells (Conrad et al., 2007, Kolodziej, 2008).",

Virus titres of coxsackie A9 were reduced by about 10,000-fold, of parainfluenza 3 by about 150-fold, and of HCo-229E by about 10-fold.

Therefore, EPs\u00ae 7630 appears to primary target enveloped viruses. In accordance, an aqueous extract of Pelargonium sidoides had been found to inhibit replication of the enveloped viruses HSV-1 and HSV-2 through interference with the virus surface resulting in virus inactivation (Schnitzler et al. 2008). However, since EPs\u00ae 7630 inhibited replication of the non-enveloped coxsackie A9 other mechanisms may also play a role.",

Moreover, the influenza A virus haemagglutinin proteins that bind to the sialic acids on the target cell's surface as a first step in the viral infection process significantly vary between the seasonal strains and H5N1 (Michaelis et al. 2009) and may therefore be differently affected by agents that interact with the virus surface.",
