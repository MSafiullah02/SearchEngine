Small animal models such as rodents, guinea pigs and hamsters offer many advantages (low cost, short gestation time and short time for disease progression). Furthermore, there is a tremendous amount of historical data over decades in rat models of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the development of genetically modified mice has transformed medical research, allowing investigators to overexpress, knock-out or knock-in genes of interest to explore the functional consequences of such genetic modulation.",

Larger hearts provide a considerable amount of tissue (from different chambers and regions of the heart) for biochemical and molecular studies. Hemodynamic assessment and imaging is easier, the heart is large enough for chronic instrumentation or for in vivo cardiac mapping studies, and large size allows assessment of human-scale interventions ranging from left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and cardiac ablative approaches. Moreover, larger animal hearts have physical dimensions more like human hearts, and this larger size may be crucial for some arrhythmogenic mechanisms. However, the cost (both purchase cost and per diem charges) can be prohibitive, especially for long-term chronic studies in disease states.",

Although the rabbit heart is smaller than that of dog or pig, it is large enough to easily do surgical and catheter-based interventions at a much lower cost (5\u201315 times less expensive than those of dogs). At the same time, many \u2018adult human scale\u2019 interventions have been or are being scaled down for pediatric use and assessment (e.g. pacemakers and CRT) so that rabbit models can be beneficial (see below). Surgical interventions are still easier than microsurgical approaches in rodents. More importantly, rabbit cardiac physiology has more characteristics that are similar to human cardiac physiology than mouse or rat has.",

This is particularly relevant for the studies of heart failure (HF) and arrhythmias because alterations in ion channel and Ca2+ transporter function or expression are thought to contribute directly to depressed contractile performance and arrhythmogenesis [2, 3]. In particular, mouse and rat ventricular action potentials (APs) have very short duration and completely lack the prominent AP plateau phase typical of human, rabbit and most mammals larger than that of rat (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the main ionic currents underlying repolarization and which greatly influence AP duration (APD) are the same in human and rabbit (delayed rectifier K+ currents I\nKr and I\nKs). These channels are not present in mouse or rat, where APD is dictated almost entirely by transient outward currents (I\nto). I\nto is present in human and rabbit ventricle, but plays only a minor role in APD in human and rabbit. Notably, the electrophysiological characteristics and secondary regulation of I\nto versus I\nKr and I\nKs are completely different, making this much more than a quantitative difference.",

However, in human and rabbit ventricular myocytes a considerably larger fraction of activating Ca2+ comes via Ca2+ entry, and the same amount is extruded at each beat by the electrogenic Na/Ca exchange [1]. Under control conditions in rabbit and human this is 24\u201330% of the Ca2+ involved in excitation\u2013contraction coupling, and in HF the SR and trans-sarcolemmal cycling can be nearly equal (Fig. 1B,C; [4, 5, 6]). Because changes in SR Ca2+ content and release, SR Ca-ATPase function and Na/Ca exchange influence both contractile function (systolic and diastolic) and arrhythmogenesis in HF, this major fundamental species difference may be crucial not only for the end-point phenotype, but also for the adaptive/maladaptive mechanisms involved in disease progression.",

Adult human and rabbit myocardia express almost entirely \u03b2-myosin so there is little room for further isoform switching (although the change may still have functional consequences). These various differences are not arguments against other large animal models (e.g. canine and porcine, which resemble human and rabbit in this regard), but are crucial when extrapolating results from mouse and rat hearts in the context of human disease.",

Although not all AR rabbits develop HF, this represents an advantage over AR models in other species such as dog that consistently manifest normal systolic function (for review, see [9]).

There are some differences in coronary anatomy between rabbits and other species. The collateral circulation is not as extensive as it is in the canine heart, and the circumflex supplies most of the LV free wall and is more dominant than the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery [22, 23]. As such, the occlusion of the marginal branch of the circumflex coronary artery is often used for MI induction, and leads to mild to moderate degrees of HF, with LV ejection fractions in the range of 40\u201350%, but in some studies EFs were as low as 27% [23, 24]. MIs are characterized by increased LV end-diastolic dimension and increased left atrial size, similar to that found in LAD infarcts in other species. There are significant alterations in \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) signaling including global reduction in \u03b2-AR density, reduced \u03b2-AR coupling and increased protein levels and activity of \u03b2ARK1 and Gi [25]. There is regional heterogeneity of intracellular Ca2+ handling [23] and impaired synchronization of Ca2+ release events throughout the myocytes [26]. In addition to chronic occlusion, a rabbit model of myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion has been used [27]. Moreover, other rabbit MI models include intracoronary microsphere embolization [28] (similar to a well-established intracoronary microembolization model in dog) [29], and direct current-shock-induced cardiac muscle injury [30].",

However, cardiotoxicity is a major clinical problem, and its cumulative toxicity on myocardium prevents their use at maximum doses that would be needed for optimal treatment [36]. Progressive reduction in ejection fraction is seen during the course of therapy, and life threatening CHF is observed in \u223c10% of patients receiving more than 550 mg/m2. This has prompted studies in experimental models. Adriamycin has been used experimentally to induce cardiomyopathy in rabbits [37, 38, 39]. This model has been useful in identifying cardioprotective agents that could limit adriamycin toxicity. It has also been useful as a model of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with severe cardiac dilatation, LV hypertrophy, and decreased LV systolic function that is progressive and irreversible, accompanied by fluid retention and activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin\u2013angiotensin systems [37]. However, there is no evidence of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor downregulation as occurs in advanced human HF [40]. Cardiotoxicity is due to free radical formation and lipid peroxidation that ultimately alters lysosomes, mitochondria, SR and the sarcolemmal membrane. These changes result in the activation of hydrolytic enzymes, calcium overload and reduced energy production [41]. Pathologic changes including cytosolic vacuolization and myofibrillar loss are typical of adriamycin cardiotoxicity in patients, but are different from those observed in other forms of nonischemic HF in humans (e.g. idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM), long-standing hypertension or valvular heart disease). Other limitations include the variable degree of LV dysfunction produced, undesirable bone marrow and GI toxicity.",

            "text": "Rapid pacing induces HF. Tachycardia-induced HF has been described in patients with long-standing tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response. As such, rapid pacing (whether ventricular or atrial) has been used to induce HF in several species \u2013 most commonly dog, but also pig and rabbit [43]. Rapid ventricular pacing in the rabbit induces HF characterized by cardiac enlargement, systolic dysfunction and ventricular myocytes exhibiting contractile dysfunction. The intermediate size of the rabbit allows implantation of standard human pacemakers. Because the intrinsic heart rates of rabbits are in the range of 220\u2013280 beats/min, pacing to rates in the range of 340\u2013400 beats/min are required [44, 45, 46]. HF develops over the course of two to five weeks and is characterized by dyspnea, appetite loss and body weight loss. Chronic pacing leads to progressive, predictable and time-dependent reduction in LV systolic function and geometry [44], which allow the study of molecular and cellular events during the development of chronic HF. Development of HF is associated with reduced responsiveness to inotropic stimulus, decreased myocyte contractility, and neurohumoral activation [44, 47]. There are changes in Ca2+ homeostatic mechanisms consistent with human HF, including decreases in Ca transient amplitude, L-type Ca2+ channel activity and SERCA expression. However, Yao et al. report decreased Na/Ca exchange current in pacing HF rabbits [45] in contrast to studies in canine pacing HF showing enhanced NCX activity when [Ca2+]i was minimally buffered [48]. As with pacing HF models in other species, LV systolic function returns to normal within approximately one week following cessation of pacing, although adenyl cyclase response to agonists takes two weeks, and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor density takes four weeks to return to normal [46]. Moreover, the LV dilatation and dysfunction is not associated with myocardial or cellular hypertrophy [44], so the changes in LV myocardial structure are not similar to those of clinical HF in humans caused by ischemic or hypertensive heart disease. The model has nonetheless provided important information regarding the pathophysiology of the failing heart including electrical remodeling [49], abnormal intracellular Ca2+ cycling [50] and exercise training in HF [51].",

            "text": "Combining volume overload (AR) with pressure overload (aortic constriction) several weeks later consistently leads to HF (much more so than either volume or pressure overload alone) [52]. We have demonstrated that HF rabbits exhibit severely depressed LV function with LVH (75% increase in HW/BW), spontaneously occurring VT that initiates by a nonreentrant mechanism such as triggered activity, and a 10% incidence of sudden death [5, 53, 54]. We also showed that HF rabbit myocytes exhibit contractile dysfunction from decreased SR Ca load that is associated with altered intracellular Ca handling (\u2191NCX, \u2193RyR and preserved SERCA); preserved \u03b2-AR responsiveness with enhanced \u03b22-AR responsiveness; decrease in ion currents (I\nto, I\nK1 and I\nKs); activation (by catecholamines) of a transient inward current I\nti that can initiate delayed after depolarizations (DADs); downregulation and dephosphorylation of the main ventricular gap junctional protein connexin43 (Cx43) increased the expression and activation of CaMKII and increased RyR phosphorylation and SR Ca2+ leak [3, 5, 53, 55, 56]. Many of these findings have been validated by focused studies in failing human hearts including 3D mapping studies showing focal nonreentrant mechanisms underlying VT in patients with nonischemic HF, NCX upregulation with preserved SERCA in a large subset of human HF patients, enhanced \u03b22-adrenergic responsiveness in failing human cardiac myocytes [53, 57, 58], and Cx43 downregulation and dephosphorylation in human HF (both ischemic and nonischemic) [55]. Other studies with this HF model have demonstrated additional insights into arrhythmogenesis [59], sinus node dysfunction in HF [60] and the effects of acute ischemia superimposed on chronic HF [61]. Thus, findings in these models have provided important new insights into human HF. While this arrhythmogenic rabbit model of nonischemic HF is technically challenging and takes months to develop, the similarities of rabbit myocardium to human myocardium and validating studies in humans indicate that this model provides important insights into the contractile dysfunction and arrhythmogenicity of the failing heart.",

TdP had been difficult to model in experimental animals, and mouse and rat which lack an AP plateau and I\nKr are less useful animal models in this arena. Carlsson et al. [62] first developed an in vivo model of TdP in the anesthetized \u03b1-adrenoreceptor (\u03b1-AR)-stimulated rabbit (methoxamine plus the Class III antiarrhythmic clofilium). This model has been used extensively by several groups with minor modification [62, 63, 64] to test for drug-induced TdP, to understand the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms [65] or to develop novel antiarrhythmic approaches for TdP [63]. It remains unclear as to how \u03b1-AR stimulation facilitates TdP induction, but could involve increases in [Ca2+]i, elevation of blood pressure or reflex vagal nerve activation [64]. Myocardial failure in the rabbit (induced by coronary artery ligation) has also been used as a model to predict the development of TdP [66].",

The expense and time for the development of transgenic rabbits has been limiting, but with further advances in the field, transgenic rabbits will offer important insights into cardiac physiology.

Although the focus of these studies is predominantly in response to antimicrobial therapy, these models have provided insight into pathogenesis of both native valve and prosthetic valve endocarditis in humans.

Direct intramuscular injection of viral vectors into rabbit LV myocardium is the simplest approach, but is limited by local transgene expression as well as traumatic effects from needle injections. Myocardial gene delivery approaches to rabbits initially involved thoracotomy-based approaches: delivery of adenoviral transgenes either by ex vivo (retrograde) intracoronary delivery to donor hearts of a heterotopic heart transplant model [94] or LV cavity injection (with ascending aorta cross-clamped) [95]. However, noninvasive techniques such as percutaneous subselective coronary artery catheterization have resulted in the efficient delivery of transgene that is ventricle-specific and targeted to the particular coronary artery that is catheterized [96]. Koch and his colleagues used these approaches to demonstrate that adenoviral gene transfer to overexpress the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor or \u03b2ARKct (a peptide inhibitor of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (\u03b2ARK1)) in the rabbit MI model can enhance contractile function and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor responsiveness, and delay the onset of HF [95, 96, 97]. Other studies in rabbit include have explored adenoviral gene transfer of sodium\u2013calcium exchanger (NCX) [98]; fibroblast growth factor-2 [28], caspase inhibitor p35 [99], norepinephrine transporter uptake-1 [100], extracellular superoxide dismutase [101] and of the antiapototic factor Bcl-2 [24].",
