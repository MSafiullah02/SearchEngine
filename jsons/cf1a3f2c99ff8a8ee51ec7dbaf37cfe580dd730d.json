One of its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/ IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for memory enhancement.",

            "text": "CIM6P/IGF2R, a type one integral membrane glycoprotein with a short cytoplasmic tail and 15 extracytoplasmic repeats, binds to a variety of ligands, among which the better characterized belong to two groups that bind to distinct sites: glycoproteins conjugated with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), including lysosomal enzymes, and IGF2 (Ghosh et al., 2003; Morgan et al., 1987; Wang et al., 2017) . CIM6P/IGF2R is implicated in numerous cellular processes including growth, trafficking of lysosomal enzymes, lysosome-mediated clearance of the polypeptide IGF2, and proteolytic activation of enzymes and growth factor precursors (El-Shewy and Luttrell, 2009; Ghosh et al., 2003; Hawkes and Kar, 2004; Wang et al., 2017) . CIM6P/IGF2R traffics newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes via early and late endosomes, where the enzymes are released in the acidic environment; late endosomes then fuse with lysosomes, while the CIM6P/IGF2R recycles back to the Golgi or to the cell surface via endosomal transport. CIM6P/IGF2R expressed on the cell membrane is best known for sequestering and internalizing IGF2, leading to its degradation in lysosomes (Oka et al., 1985) ; in this case as well, the receptor recycles back to its intracellular or plasma membrane compartments. The same trafficking pathway is also used by a subset of lysosomal enzymes that are secreted into the extracellular space: the enzymes bind to cell surface CIM6P/IGF2R, and are then targeted to lysosomes; see Ghosh et al. (2003) , for a thorough review of the binding partners and sorting signals for CIM6P/ IGF2R trafficking. CIM6P/IGF2R-null mice exhibit perinatal lethality, significant overgrowth abnormalities in organ development, particularly in cardiac tissue, and mis-sorting of M6P-tagged lysosomal enzymes. Collectively, these phenotypes indicate that CIM6P/IGF2R is crucial for normal growth and development, as well as for the correct trafficking of lysosomal enzymes (Lau et al., 1994; Ludwig et al., 1996) ; Z.-Q. Wang et al. (1994) ; Wylie et al., 2003) .",

In many types of human cancers, including tumors of the lung, liver, and breast, CIM6P/IGF2R frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity, often accompanied by loss-of-function mutation in the remaining allele (De Souza et al., 1995; Hankins et al., 1996; Kong et al., 2000; Ouyang et al., 1997) . Loss of CIM6P/IGF2R function is thought to allow abnormally high levels of circulating IGF2 to exert mitogenic effects, presumably acting via its low-affinity receptor IGF1R (Ludwig et al., 1996) , resulting in tumor growth.",

First, we reproduced the findings by Chen et al.

We then tested additional timepoints for memory retention and found that the effect of blocking CIM6P/IGF2R with the two injections was long-lasting: memory impairment persisted at 1 week, and memory was not re-instated after exposure to a reminder shock (RS) given in a distinct context. Again, consistent with the results of Chen et al. (2011) , we found that a single bilateral injection given either immediately after training, or 8 hr later was not able to impact memory retention (Figure 2b and c) , indicating that the critical function of CIM6P/IGF2R in memory formation extends for a temporal window of several hours after training.",

Memory was also completely disrupted by this regimen (Figure 3a) , confirming that CIM6P/ IGF2R is recruited by learning and essential for long-term memory formation. However, using independent cohorts of rats, in order to avoid confounds of multiple testing, we found that pre-training injection of anti-CIM6P/IGF2R did not impact learning, as memory retention was intact when tested 5 min after training (Figure 3b ). Memory impairment was however already significant at 1 hr after training (Figure 3c) , indicating that CIM6P/IGF2R is controlling a rapid post-training function that is key for memory consolidation.

Specifically, we administered a bilateral anti-CIM6P/IGF2R injection 15 min prior to IA training, and then tested the injected rats in the open field 1 day later ( Figure 3d ). Both their locomotion (as measured by total distance travelled and average velocity) or anxiety measures (time spent in the center of the arena) were indistinguishable from those of IgGinjected controls. Moreover, anti-CIM6P/IGF2R injection had no effect on memory retrieval: a bilateral injection given 15 min before test at 1 day after training had no effect on memory retention in the 1 day or 1 week test (Figure 3e ). The lack of an effect on the 7 day test also revealed that CIM6P/IGF2R is dispensable for memory reconsolidation, the process of fragility and re-stabilization produced by retrieval (Alberini, 2011) .",

AAV-hSyn-Cre-GFP (Cre) or control AAV-hSyn-GFP (GFP) virus was bilaterally injected into dorsal hippocampi of Igf2r-floxed mice, and the viruses were allowed to express for 2 weeks before behavioral assessment.",

Given that the training-induced increase in proteins, but not mRNAs, of all three IEGs was affected by CIM6P/IGF2R, we asked whether the receptor controls the learningdependent increase in de novo protein synthesis in general. To this end, we employed in vivo SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET), which measures incorporation of puromycin into elongating peptide chains (Schmidt et al., 2009) , thus assessing active translation (Descalzi et al., 2019; Goodman et al., 2011; Santini et al., 2013) . Puromycin was co-injected with anti-CIM6P/IGF2R or IgG bilaterally into rat hippocampi 15 min prior to IA training or in untrained control rats. All animals were perfused 2 hr after injection, and coronal brain sections were subjected to immunostaining to measure the puromycin signal. As expected, training led to significant induction of puromycin incorporation throughout the dorsal hippocampus, which was especially prominent in neuronal populations, but this induction was completely abolished by anti-CIM6P/IGF2R (Figure 6a ). Together, these data indicate that CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-dependent increase in de novo protein synthesis.",

To determine whether the memory-enhancing effect of IGF2 is a function of the receptor, rather than IGF2 per se, we investigated a distinct CIM6P/IGF2R ligand, M6P. Vehicle or varying doses of M6P (0.005, 5, 25 and 150 mM) were injected bilaterally into the rat dorsal hippocampus immediately after IA training to obtain a dose-response curve. We found that 5 mM and 25 mM, but not the other doses, significantly enhanced memory retention (Figure 7a) . The effect was long-lasting, and the memory enhancement Figure 5 . CIM6P/IGF2R is required for learning-induced IEG protein induction in rats. Rats were injected with IgG or anti-CIM6P/IGF2R, and then were either trained on IA 15 min later (Tr) or remained Untrained (Un). To examine mRNA levels, rats were euthanized 1 hr after training and hippocampi flash-frozen.

These results indicated that the CIM6P/IGF2R is promptly recruited by training and regulates rapid mechanisms critical for memory consolidation. However, once engaged by learning, the function of CIM6P/IGF2R in memory consolidation continued for several hours: only a prolonged post-training blockade of the receptor by two injections, one immediately after training and another 8 hr later, produced memory impairment.

Our data showed that CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for the induction of de novo protein synthesis in response to learning, including the increase of the IEGs Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins. In fact, receptor blockade abolished their induction specifically at the protein level, without affecting induction of the corresponding mRNAs. Thus, CIM6P/IGF2R is a critical upstream regulator of de novo protein synthesis increase evoked by learning. These results provided key information on mechanisms downstream of the CIM6P/IGF2R; however, the specific mechanistic steps that link the receptor to de novo translation, and particularly translation of IEGs, remain to be understood. Because CIM6P/IGF2R has a small intracellular domain and does not have known direct signal transduction mechanisms (El-Shewy and Luttrell, 2009), there are no predictable hypotheses about which molecular mechanisms directly activate its downstream steps. We speculate that these mechanisms reside in domains that link of endosomal trafficking, lysosomal degradation and Golgi functions to learning-induced de novo translation, a complex area of investigation that shall be explored in future studies.",

More specifically, it has been found that IA training in rats very rapidly activates de novo translation in the hippocampus, and this translation is required for memory consolidation. This critical de novo protein synthesis continues, presumably through multiple waves, for more than 24 hr after training, returning to control conditions by 48 hr post-training (Arguello et al., 2013; Bambah-Mukku et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2011; Garcia-Osta et al., 2006; Taubenfeld et al., 2001) . Our data showed that while a pre-training injection of receptor blocking antibody completely blocks long-term memory formation, a single injection given after training has no effect. This suggests that, once engaged, the receptor remains functionally critical for some time. In agreement with this explanation, two injections 8 hr apart given after training, but not single injections or even a single injection of 10x higher concentration of blocking antibody, were able to impair long-term memory. Together with our in vivo SUnSET data showing that the receptor controls de novo translation induced by learning, these results lead us to speculate that CIM6P/IGF2R is intimately coupled to the induction and persistence of experienceregulated de novo translation. If this were the case, we would expect that the inhibition of the receptor and of protein synthesis have similar temporal profiles of functional requirement. This is indeed the case, as, like with blockers of the receptor, a pre-training injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin completely blocks long-term memory formation, whereas post-training injections have graded effects for the first 24 hr after training (Bambah-Mukku et al., 2014) .",

Importantly, our experiments could not dissect whether the decrease in puromycin incorporation upon CIM6P/IGF2R blockade was due to inhibition of mRNA translation or acceleration of protein degradation. In addition, a recent study reported that mRNA translation in axons of retinal ganglion cells occurs on ribosomes associated with late endosomes docked at mitochondria (Cioni et al., 2019) . Given that CIM6P/IGF2R traffics cargo via endosomes, we speculate that the receptor may regulate endosomal availability and trafficking required for protein synthesis. Moreover, because CIM6P/IGF2R is crucial for maintaining lysosomal function (Ludwig et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1994) , it may be involved in the regulation of protein degradation, which is activated in long-term plasticity and memory (Bingol and Sheng, 2011; Fern\u00e1ndez-Monreal et al., 2012; Goo et al., 2017) .",

Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and stainless-steel guide cannulae (22-gauge) were implanted to bilaterally target the dorsal hippocampus (dHC, 4.0 mm posterior to bregma, 2.6 mm lateral to midline, 2 mm ventral to skull surface) using a stereotaxic apparatus. Rats were administered meloxicam (3 mg/kg, subcutaneously, once pre-surgery), and allowed to recover from surgery in their home cage for at least 7 days before undergoing behavioral experiments. At the indicated time points before or after training or retrieval, rats received bilateral injections of compounds as specified. All injections were delivered in a volume of 1.0 mL over 3 min using a 28-gauge needle (extending 1.5 mm beyond the guide cannula) attached to polyethylene tubing (PE50) connected to 10 mL Hamilton syringes controlled by a micro-infusion pump. Infusions were delivered at a rate of 0.33 mL/ min, and the injection needle was left in place for 2 min after the injection to allow complete dispersion of the solution. Cannula placement was verified at the end of the behavioral experiments. To this end, brains were snap-frozen, and 40 mm coronal sections were cut through the hippocampus, and examined under a light microscope. Twelve (out of 235) rats were excluded due to incorrect cannula placement. Anti-CIM6P/IGF2R antibody (R and D Systems # AF2447, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or IgG control was dissolved in PBS and injected at the indicated times at 5 or 50 ng/mL as described. At a concentration of 5 ng/mL, the antibody blocked 95% of CIM6P/IGF2R in an in vitro binding assay (R and D Systems). Puromycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in PBS and co-injected (10 mg/side) with anti-CIM6P/IGF2R antibody or IgG, 15 min before IA training. Mannose-6-phosphate (Sigma) was dissolved in PBS and injected immediately after IA training at 5 mM, 5 mM, 25 mM, or 150 mM to generate a dose-response curve.",

The safe compartment was white and illuminated by a light fixture on the compartment wall. The shock compartment was black and unilluminated. Footshock was delivered to the grid floor of this chamber via a constant-current scrambler circuit. The two compartments were separated by an automatically operated sliding door. During training sessions, each rat was placed in the safe compartment with its head facing away from the door. After 10 s (s) the door automatically opened, allowing the rat access to the shock chamber. The door closed 1 s after the rat entered the shock chamber, and a brief, 2 s footshock (0.6 mA or 0.9 mA, as indicated) was administered. Latency to enter the shock compartment was taken as a measure of acquisition. The rat was then returned to its home cage. Retention tests were performed at the indicated times by placing the rat back into the safe compartment and measuring the latency to enter the shock compartment. Footshock was not administered on the retention test, and testing was terminated at 900 s and performed by an experimenter blinded to the treatments given. The reminder shock (RS) procedure was used to test whether impaired memory could be reinstated. RS consisted of giving the animals a 2 s footshock of the same intensity as that received during training in a different context, which consisted of a square chamber (Med Associates) with three transparent walls, one opaque Plexiglas wall, and a floor grid with narrower spacing in a separate, well-lit room.

Freezing, defined as lack of movement besides heartbeat and respiration, was recorded every tenth second by a trained experimenter blind to the experimental conditions. The percentage of time spent frozen across the total number of observations was calculated (Schrick et al., 2007) . The Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure was modified from previous studies (Lovett-Barron et al., 2014; Stern et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2005) . Mice were placed in the conditioning chamber; after 2 min they received one tone-shock pairing (30 s tone co-terminating with a 2 s, 1 mA footshock), and 30 s later they were returned to the home cage. Memory for the training context was tested by placing the mouse back into the conditioning chamber (1 or 7 days after training) for 3 min, in the absence of a footshock. Memory for the tone was tested in an alternate context (2 or 8 days after training). During tone testing, after 1 min in the new context (pre-tone), the tone was played for 2 min. Videos acquired during the 3 min context test, 1 min pre-tone, and 2 min tone were scored by an experimenter blind to the experimental procedures. Mouse contextual fear conditioning Contextual fear conditioning was conducted similarly to Pavlovian fear conditioning. The procedure only differed in that the 2 s footshock during training was not signaled by a tone. Memory testing was carried out in the training context as described above, at the indicated timepoints after training. In experiments studying memory enhancement, contextual fear conditioning training was carried out using a lower footshock intensity, 0.7 mA, to prevent a ceiling effect in the freezing response.",

Brains were isolated and postfixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4\u02daC, and then submerged in 30% sucrose in PBS for 72 hr. Brain sections (20 um) were cut using a cryostat for free-floating immunofluorescence staining. Sections were subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval in nanopure H 2 O for 2 min at 100\u02daC. The sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hr at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibodies in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS overnight at 4\u02daC. The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFAP (1:5000, Abcam, #ab4674, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:5000, Wako, #019-19741, Osaka, Japan), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:5000, Millipore, #MAB3418, Billerica, MA), mouse anti-CaMKIIa (1:1000, Millipore, #05-532), rabbit anti-IGF2R (1:1000, Abcam, #ab124767), chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Aves Labs, #GFP-1020, Tigard, OR), rabbit anti-Arc (1:2000, Synaptic systems #156 003, G\u00f6 ttingen, Germany), rabbit anti-Egr1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, #4153, Danvers, MA, USA), and rabbit anti-c-Fos (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, #2250). Sections were then washed with PBS three times for 10 min, and then incubated in secondary antibody for 2 hr at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-chicken conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (1:1000, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Brain sections were washed with PBS three times for 10 min, and then mounted with Prolong Diamond antifade mounting medium with 4',6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen). Two brain sections from each animal (one section per bregma, at approximately bregma \u00c03.6 mm and \u00c04.0 mm for rats, and \u00c01.7 mm and \u00c02.2 mm for mice from dorsal hippocampus) were used for each set of staining. Image acquisition and quantification analysis were conducted by an experimenter blinded to the experimental conditions. Four images per subregion (CA1 and DG) were imaged per hemisphere for each animal, yielding a total of 16 images for each sub-region, per animal. Images were captured as 1 mm z-stacks using 10 steps on a TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at 63X magnification. Images were processed and quantified using the ImageJ software (US National Institutes of Health). All images for each independent experiment were processed in the same manner: first, background was subtracted and a maximum projection image was rendered using ImageJ. To quantify the intensity and number of immunopositive cells, images were subjected to thresholding, fill holes, watershed, and analyze particles (Hartig, 2013; Jedlicka et al., 2015; Roy et al., 2016; Vasileiou et al., 2016) . For each hippocampal subregion, sixteen images were analysed, and their values normalized against their total number of cells determined using DAPI (4 0 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining, a marker commonly used to visualize nuclei. The values per sub-region per each animal were averaged. The data per group of animals in each experimental condition were expressed as intensity or number of positive cells (in %), both normalized against the total number of cells (DAPI staining). For co-localization analysis, single z planes were extracted from the z-stack. To visualize dorsal hippocampus, multiple overlapping images (10% overlap) were captured at 20 \u00c2 magnification, and a composite image was constructed using the LAS X software (Leica).",

The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-rabbit IRDye800CW and anti-mouse IRDye680 (1:10000, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA). After three additional 10 min TBST washes, membranes were scanned on the Li-Cor Odyssey imager under non-saturating conditions.

P values were generated using Student's t-tests, one-or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or repeated measure (RM) ANOVA followed by Sidak or Tukey post hoc tests. All analyses were two-tailed, and data were considered significant when p<0.05. The numbers of subjects used in our experiments were the minimum required to obtain statistical significance, based on our experience with the behavioral paradigm and in agreement with standard literature. Both male and female transgenic mice were used for our experiments. Preliminary statistical analyses comparing males and females (n = 2-4) showed no significant difference in value distribution (unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test, p>0.05), therefore, males and females were combined into a single group for between group comparisons. Although these values of n are too low for any robust statistical analysis, we decided to group the subjects and to refrain from pursuing sex-related questions.",
