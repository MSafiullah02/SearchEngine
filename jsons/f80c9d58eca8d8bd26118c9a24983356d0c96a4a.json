The WHO reported 3,947 probable SARS cases with 229 deaths worldwide on April 22, 2003; China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Toronto, Canada, had the most cases. Taiwan, meanwhile, had 29 probable cases and no deaths. Seventyeight percent of the cases were imported. The growth of the numbers of SARS infections seemed to be a typical minor outbreak at that time. On that day, a new cluster of seven infections in Hoping Hospital in Taipei was reported and it started a chain of local transmissions that cumulated in 116 probable cases and 10 deaths in the following two weeks. By mid-May, the numbers grew to 264 probable cases and 34 deaths. Subsequently, by June 1, it expanded into 680 probable cases and 81 deaths. In a period of less than one month, more than a sixfold increase in the numbers of SARS infections and victims was erupted rapidly in Taiwan. The rapid increase rates of reported probable SARS case-patients and deaths undoubtedly would cause a panic nationwide in Taiwan.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 62, "end": 89, "text": "Hsieh, Chen, and Hsu (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A Nationwide Panic Caused in Taiwan"}, {"text": "In addition to the rapid increase rate of reported probable SARS casepatients, the nationwide panic in Taiwan might also be resulted from a sense of the endless and uncontrolled expansion of the outbreak. As the disease was spreading so rapidly, the health authority in Taiwan enforced many stringent measures in order to contain the outbreak. In addition to thermal scanning arrivals from abroad to check for signs of fever induced by SARS, Hsieh et al. (2004) indicate two of the most important stressed measures. One measure was reporting, admitting, and hospitalizing all susceptible patients. The other was the house quarantine of people either those with contacts to the suspected case-patients or arrivals from the affected areas abroad. However, on the first hand, hospitals in Taiwan were initially unprepared for and unprotected from the SARS disease. The patient quarantine rooms, personal protective equipments for health care workers, and general infection control, etc., which had been improved and well prepared professionally later (Esswein et al., 2004) , were relatively insufficient at the beginning of the outbreak. Since frequent unprotected or inadequately protected patient-to-health care worker interactions and grouping large numbers of ill persons can greatly amplify intrahospital transmission (Gopalakrishna et al., 2004) , almost 73 percent of all traceable infections in Taiwan occurred in hospital settings (Hsieh et al., 2004) . It caused inevitably a panic among all medical professions on the frontline in the battle against SARS. On the other hand, the home quarantine of a number of susceptible people was frequently broken (Hsieh et al., 2004) . Just as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), it cannot be considered quarantineable not only because of medical but also because of ethical and legal issues (Gensini, Yacoub, & Conti, 2004) . Accordingly, a sense of uncontrollability was emerged publicly at the beginning of the SARS outbreak. Furthermore, the local sensationalist media accelerated and amplified the resulted panic from the sense of uncontrollability successfully by focusing their attention on some intrahospital transmission and out-of-supervised quarantine cases. This phenomenon was consistent with Mason, Grabowski, and Du's (2005, p. 17) description of the global media that the media were much less interested in providing accurate information and more concerned with selling copies of their publication through sensationalist but inaccurate stories.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 442, "end": 461, "text": "Hsieh et al.

The travel advisories did trigger a chain reaction of public anxiety even in areas well beyond the outbreak sites. The announcements were unprecedented in the WHO's almost 45-year history, for this was the first time that the organization had issued advisories for specific geographical areas due to an outbreak of an epidemic (WTTC, 2003) .

Based on the costs of canceled travel and decreased investment in Asia, the economic costs have been estimated ranging from US$30,000 million to US$140,000 (WHO, 2003d) . It is even estimated to produce costs that might rival the Asian Financial Crisis of the mid-1990s (de Lisle, 2004) . Lakshmanan (2003) (as cited by McKercher & Chon, 2004) well describes the very unusual feature of the SARS outbreak by a statement that ''a panic spread faster than the disease itself.'' Most likely, it was partly contributed by the participation of the global media as a role of accelerators and amplifiers in the spread of the worldwide panic. Since the WHO publicized its message about SARS and travel warning by using the global media, however, it could not write word-for-word the article or website commentary, the organization could hardly control the tone or precise nature of any media communication. Accordingly, Mason et al. (2005) point out that the way the WHO's global health alert was reported by the world's media is also likely to have contributed to the feeling of worldwide panic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 221, "end": 246, "text": "McKercher and Chon (2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 538, "end": 550, "text": "(WHO, 2003d)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 652, "end": 668, "text": "(de Lisle, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 671, "end": 688, "text": "Lakshmanan (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 702, "end": 725, "text": "McKercher & Chon, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1313, "text": "Mason et al.

The significance of the univariate F ratios indicates that when the independent variables are considered individually, only the respondents' age, their patronage frequency, and risk perception were significant predictors in discriminating between the groups. Besides, the pooled within-groups correlation matrix indicates low correlations between the independent variables. In this case, multicollinearity was unlikely to be a problem. Given low intercorrelations between the independent variables in Table 4 , independent variables with relatively large standardized coefficients contribute more to the discriminating power of the function, as compared with independent variables with smaller coefficients. Therefore, respondents' age and their patronage frequency in the last year contribute to most, while respondents' risk perception also contributes to some, of the inter-group differences. The signs of the coefficients associated with the significant predictors suggest that younger age and more experience in visiting theme parks were more likely to result in the respondents visiting theme parks during the SARS outbreak.

Moreover, individuals who visited theme parks during the SARS outbreak were also associated with higher risk perception. Substantial marketing implications can be explored based on the results of the discriminant analysis, although the function seems to be of deficient validity in terms of predictability. First of all, in case the SARS or similar biological crises emerge in the future, younger and/or frequent consumers should be the focused targets of theme park managers' primary marketing efforts because they are more likely to continue to visit theme parks during the period of epidemic outbreak. Accordingly, a plague survival strategy can be developed with the goal of attracting consumers from the targets. Since the benefits sought by theme park visitors played only a trivial role in their patronage decisions during the SARS outbreak, contents of the promotion projects may not be associated with or restricted to particular benefits of visiting theme parks. Instead, a series of sales promotions, such as special promotional prices for the admission of large teen groups, cross-promotions with firms providing other products or services to young consumers, or discounted season passes for potential heavy-users, may help theme parks survive the period of epidemic outbreak.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS"}, {"text": "One of the results of this study indicates that individuals who continued visiting theme parks during the SARS outbreak were associated with higher risk perception in comparison with those who did not visit theme parks. It is interesting to note that Grobe and Douthitt (1995) also obtained similar findings from their research regarding milk consumers' risk perception of the recombinant (synthetic) bovine growth hormone (rbGH). Their findings indicated that consumers who purchase more milk perceive a greater risk than those who purchase less (p. 141). However, they did not explain the findings of their research. In fact, the theme park visitors' continued patronage or the milk purchasers' greater consumption resulted in, rather than resulted from, their greater risk perception. In detail, the consistent theme park patronage during the SARS outbreak and milk consumption under the purchasers' psychological resistance to the rbGH injection seem to be caused by individuals' relatively inelastic demands for theme parks or milk. In order to build lasting customer relationships, managers should compensate the customers with inelastic demands for their consistent patronage rather than take advantage of them since there are usually a couple of brands or selections for a particular product. Therefore, in case the SARS or similar biological crises emerge in the future, the present seems to be the perfect time to build up a valuable database consisting of the customers with inelastic demands for particular hospitality and tourism services. Thus, service providers may continuously benefit from the database. The finding that visitors' risk perception of the SARS infection did not largely contribute to their patronage decisions during the SARS outbreak provides indirect evidence that theme park visitors' ''risk attitude'' dominated their ''risk perception'' in their risk response behavior to the SARS epidemic. Pennings, Wansink, and Meulenberg (2002) proposed that the behavior of consumers in a crisis situation can be explained by a combination of risk perception and risk attitude. Whereas risk attitude deals with consumers' interpretation of the content of the risk, the seriousness of adverse consequences, or the extent of risk aversion toward a particular crisis, risk perception instead deals with consumers' interpretation of the chance of being exposed to the content of the risk. Since individuals with greater risk perception were the ones who continued to visit theme parks while those with lower risk perception tended to avoid the patronage, risk perception does not seem to be the dominant motivator of theme park visitors. Suppose that risk attitude is the true motivator behind theme park visitors' responses to the SARS outbreak. In such a case, Pennings et al. suggest that even if the probabilities of being exposed to the risk are small, effectively communicating these probabilities will have little influence on consumer behavior. Instead, marketers will have to focus on ways to eliminate the risk. Chien and Law (2003) suggested substantial processes to minimize hotel employees and guests' possibility of SARS infection and to contain the potential spread of viruses on the hotel property. The processes can also be well utilized by other businesses or services in the hospitality and tourism industry. In addition to actually implementing the processes of risk elimination, it is equally important that management should make efforts to let the potential consumers know and let the customers see, smell, hear, and feel the processes of risk elimination on the property.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 251, "end": 276, "text": "Grobe and Douthitt (1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1928, "end": 1968, "text": "Pennings, Wansink, and Meulenberg (2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3043, "end": 3063, "text": "Chien and Law (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS"}, {"text": "Based on the findings and limitations of this study, several recommendations for further research can be drawn.

Extended from the existing related literature, the following research might be expected to establish a theoretical model -consisting risk perception, risk attitude, and other significant variables -of people's responses to disease outbreaks. Second, although the significant role of the media in the SARS outbreak has been well discussed in Mason et al. (2005) in terms of the amount of media attention given to the outbreak along the five stages of Hall's (2002) ''issue-attention cycle,'' given a strong averse risk attitude toward particular epidemics or pandemics, issues regarding how and what the media can communicate effectively to the public to have significant influence on their responses to the disease outbreak can be further investigated by the following research. However, it might be even more important to know how to allure or encourage the media to cease rather than amplify social panic by the above approaches. The Singapore case -a well-trusted institute (e.g., tourist board) coordinates related media and tourism sectors to establish a taskforce and working with the national health authority to produce guidelines and to have a hold over the social panic -indicated in Henderson (2003) might not work applicably in elsewhere, however, it did provide a sample of possible domestic problem-solving mechanism.

In addition to the substantial suggestions on possible adjustments of marketing mix, some implications can be emerged from the findings and discussion of this study. It should be firstly noted that, during a plague outbreak, the impact against tourism industry is primarily generated by the panic resulted from the plague rather than by the plague itself. The dominant determinant in the formulation of the plague-resulted panic tends to be the magnitude of people's aversion (risk attitude) to the plague rather than the perceived possibility to be infected by the plague (risk perception). By the back-up of the media, the scale and spread of possible emerged panic tends to be amplified and accelerated extensively. If a panic has been prevailed, it might be an inevitable outcome that people tend to over-react in their responses to a plague outbreak. People's over-reactions might be represented by decreasing the amount of consumption or even the collapse of regional tourism. According to the subsequence of a plague-outbreak crisis emerging from the discovery and identification of an epidemic to possible damages suffered by tourism industry, several critical points between different stages of the crisis progression can be found.
