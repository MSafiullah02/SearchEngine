            "text": "A global emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic demands various studies related to genes and genomes of the SARS-CoV2. Among other important proteins, the role of accessory proteins are of immense importance in replication, regulation of infections of the coronavirus in the hosts. The largest accessory proteins in the SARS-CoV2 genome is ORF3a which modulates the host response to the virus infection and consequently it plays an important role in pathogenesis. In this study, an attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty two genomes of Indian patients. ORF3a gene possesses single and double point mutations in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes suggesting the change of SARS-CoV2's virulence property in Indian patients. We find that the parental origin of the ORF3a gene over the genomes of SARS-CoV2 and Pangolin-CoV is same from the phylogenetic analysis based on conservations of nucleotides and so on. This study highlights the accumulation of mutation on ORF3a in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes which may provide the designing therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV2.",

            "text": "Since December, 2019, the coronavirus disease due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originating from Wuhan, China, has been causing a pandemic across the world [1, 2] . The causative virus, SARS-CoV2 is a positive-stranded RNA virus with genome size approximately of 30000 bases. The genome of SARS-CoV2 contains twenty nine open reading frames (ORFs) [3, 4] . Among the twenty nine 5 ORFs, there are sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsps), four structural proteins (E, M, N, S), and six or seven accessory proteins such as ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 [5, 6, 7] . SARS-CoV2 has been thought to be evolved due to rapid mutation, and recombination with existing other coronavirus in the body. They can alter tissue tropism, cross the species barrier and adopt to different epidemiological situations [8] . Sequence similarity based phylogeny infers that the SARS-CoV2 forms a distinct lineage with Bat-SARSlike coronaviruses that belong to the genus Beta-coronavirus (\u03b2-CoVs) [9] . The SARS-CoV2 genomes have a significant sequential similarity with percentages 96.3%, 89%, and 82% with bat CoV, SARS-like CoV, and SARS-CoV, respectively, which confirms zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV2 [10] . There are about 380 amino acid changes from the different proteins of SARS-CoV genomes to the proteins of present SARS-CoV2 genomes as reported so far [11] . The 348, 27 and 5 changes of amino acids occurred in different accessory proteins, S 15 protein and N protein respectively [11] . The accessory proteins have a significant role in virus pathogenesis and these proteins regulate the interferon signalling pathways and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [12] . The ORF3a gene which encodes a protein of 274 amino acids, is the second largest sub-genomic RNA in the genome of SARS-CoV [13] . The ORF3a gene encodes a protein with TRAF, ion channel and caveolin binding domain [14] . Mutation in these region alters the NF-kB activation and NLRP3 inflammosome [13] . 20 One of the important features of the ORF3a protein is the presence of a cysteine-rich domain as observed in the SARS-CoV genomes [15] . The ORF3a protein is expressed abundantly in infected and transfected cells, which localizes to intracellular and plasma membranes [16, 17] . It induces apoptosis in transfected and infected cells [18] . In the SARS-CoV genomes, co-mutation between the ORF3a gene and the spike gene exists which suggests that the function of the ORF3a protein correlates with the spike protein [19, 20, 21] . Therefore 25 locating the mutation in ORF3a proteins might lead to understanding the functionality changes in the protein during viral spreading. Till today, no such study has been carried out to look for the existence of ORF3a variation in the Indian patients.",

A set of brief remarks on the accessory protein coding genes across the thirty two genomes from the Indian patients is given in Table 1 . The proteins ORF7a, ORF6 55 and ORF10 are 100% conserved in the thirty-two SARS-CoV2 genomes of Indian origin. However, there are four different types of ORF3a genes that are found based on single-point mutations.

We named these two Indian groups as ORF3a-Type-3 and ORF3a-Type-4 (refer to Table 2 ). The nucleotide frequencies, length and some associated remarks of the four types of ORF3a genes of SARS-CoV2 genomes of the Indian patients including the ORF3a genes of the pangolin and Bat CoV are presented in Table 2 . In the Table 2 The Fig.3 follows that the ORF3a-Type-3 is obtained by two single point mutation (G to T) from the ORF3a-Type-1. Likewise, the ORF3a-Type-4 is achieved by two single point mutations (G to T and C to T) from the ORF3a-Type-1. The genomes which contain the four different types of ORF3a genes of thirty two SARS-CoV2 genomes of the Indian patients are mentioned in Table 3 .

After a single mutation, the GC content of ORF3a-Type-2 is slightly reduced to 39.5% from that of the ORF3a-Type-1 gene. The GC content of Pangolin CoVs is turned out to be minimum and that is 39.13%. The GC content of ORF3a-Type-2 gene and ORF3a of MT040333 is identical though the density of G and C are 130 slightly different in the respective sequences. The ORF3a genes across fifteen different genomes of CoV of the three hosts are highly conserved with equally likely presence of the four nucleotide bases as the Conv SE for all the genes are turned out to be approximately 1.",

At the 6th level of the phylogenetic tree, the ORF3a-Type-3 and that of the genomes MT040334 and MT040336 of CoV of Pangolin belong and naturally they are co-evolved from the previous evolutionary levels of the tree.

This presence of the codon CGC (codes Arginine) deviates the ORF3a gene of SARS-CoV2 and Pangolin CoV from that of the Bat-CoV. In contrast, ORF3a genes of the genomes of Bat-CoV contain it. It is found that the frequency of GAG, GTG in ORF3a genes of Bat-CoV dominates that of the other two host genomes. The most preferred stop codon across all the ORF3a genes of various CoV genomes is TAA.

These mutations (Q to H, D to Y, S to L) are located near TRAF, ion channel, and caveolin binding domains respectively, suggesting that Type-3 and Type-4 might have effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This unique non-synonymous mutations might affect the virulence of the virus and this needs a special attention from pathogenesis perspective by the medical scientists. A set of ORF3a 225 genes of the Pangolin and Bat-CoVs were taken into consideration to investigate the evolutionary relationship from the phylogenies based on the nucleotides, dimers, codons and amino acids over the gene ORF3a across various genomes of CoVs. Based on conservations of nucleotide bases over the ORF3a genes, it is turned out that the ORF3a genes of four types of SARS-CoV2 and CoV-Pangolin are evolved from the ORF3a gene of the Pangolin CoV genome MT040333. It is worth noting that the ORF3a genes of Pangolin and Bat-CoV 230 genomes are much more closer than that of SARS-CoV2, from the phylogenetic analysis of codon and amino acids conservations. From the molecular conservation analysis, it is emerged that the ORF3a genes across the seventeen genomes of SARS-CoV2 along with that of Pangolin and Bat-CoVs are co-evolved from the same origin.",
