Despite the findings of poor accuracy for diagnosis of VAP of individual clinical indicators, we believe that there are several shortcomings that were not fully discussed.",

However, as the authors clearly pointed out these criteria are themselves \u201csubject to disagreement between pathologists\u201d. How could the authors use as gold-standard criteria that are not well defined? Besides, as Osler has already noted over 100 years ago with the so-called terminal pneumonia\u2014that we now classified as HAP or VAP\u2014this is not lobar pneumonia as CAP but more patchy pneumonia characterized by infiltrates being spread heterogeneously in the lung; in this way, a single normal biopsy does not exclude the presence of HAP/VAP since the biopsy could have reached normal lung area and, a few centimetres away, we could have alveolar infiltration.",

In addition, VAEs have shown a poor correlation with both VAP and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and have been associated with higher consumption of resources (ICU and hospital length of stay), but not with mortality. Since VAE was designed only as a surveillance tool and the assessed criteria \u201chave poor accuracy for diagnosing\u201d VAP, what do the authors propose for clinical use at the bedside?",
