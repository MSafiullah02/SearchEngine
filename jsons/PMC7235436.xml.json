[1] COVID-19 causes mild disease in the majority of cases; however, approximately 14% develops severe disease requiring hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% requires admission to an intensive care unit. [1] Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure [2] and the risk is higher in old age groups with comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease [3]. Critically ill patients will require mechanical ventilation [2, 4, 5]. Hypotonic solutions should be avoided in the management of COVID-19 [4]. The most common diagnosis in severe COVID-19 patients is severe pneumonia.",

[11] We presented a 12- year old girl with underlying asthma who presented with mild pneumonia secondary to COVID-19. We have demonstrated that children with underlying comorbidities such as asthma may be at a greater risk of COVID-19 similar to adults with other comorbidities [3]. Though there is minimal literature on the risk that COVID-19 could trigger a viral induced exacerbation of asthma in asthmatic children [11] and little is known about COVID-19 clinical presentations in children to date, we have demonstrated that COVID-19 may present with a clinical picture of asthma or asthma exacerbation in asthmatic children, with cough; wheeze, and breathing difficulties.",
