Observing Google Trends, we noted a correlation between the dynamics of key searches for symptoms referable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the increase in ICU admissions and new deaths. Indeed, Google searches for cough and fever preceded by 1 week, the need for critical care in Italy and by 2 weeks deaths from COVID-19. Recent research attempted to explore the relationship between Google Trends and COVID-19 and to evaluate the possibility of predicting new cases from internet searches [3, 4]. However, at least in Italy, the search of keywords as \u201ccoronavirus\u201d or \u201cpneumonia\u201d during the COVID-19 crisis was broadly unspecific and mostly attributable to informative purposes, showing a linear increase temporally corresponding to the interest toward the pandemic from mass media and public opinion. Therefore, we postulated that simple terms referring to key early COVID-19 symptoms\u2014e.g. \u201cfever\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d\u2014or even more specific such as \u201closs of smell\u201d or \u201closs of taste\u201d could be more explanatory of the viral outbreak\u2019s evolution.",

For this analysis, we selected the same period of ICU admissions from February 24 to April 6 and we searched Google trends 1 week before using the Italian words \u201cmal di schiena\u201d, \u201ctachicardia\u201d, \u201cprurito\u201d, \u201cdiarrea\u201d, corresponding to \u201cback pain\u201d, \u201ctachycardia\u201d, \u201citching\u201d and \u201cdiarrhea\u201d in English translation. In linear regression analysis, we found an extremely weak positive correlation between searches for \u201cdiarrea\u201d (R2 0.122, p = 0.023) and increase in ICU admissions, no correlation for \u201cmal di schiena\u201d (R2 0.012, p = 0.496) and negative correlations for \u201cprurito\u201d (R2 0.119, p = 0.025) and tachycardia (R2 0.273, p < 0.001). No temporal trends could, therefore, be identified between search volumes of terms not closely referable to COVID-19 and increase in ICU admissions (Fig. 3a\u2013d), confirming that symptoms suggestive of viral respiratory infection, such as \u201cfever\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d, could more reliably predict the increase in ICU beds demand.",

In particular, official Italian data (https://www.epicentro.iss.it/influenza/bilancio-2018_2019) reported that, in 2018\u20132019, seasonal flu peaked between late January and early February 2019. We thus plotted Google Trends of key terms \u201cfever\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d from December 2018 to April 2019 against search volumes during the same months of the 2019\u20132020 season, outlining how the interest toward \u201cfever\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d was considerably higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the peak of previous year flu outbreak (Fig. 4a, b). Interestingly, a surge in Google Trends for \u201cfever\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d could also be observed around the end of January 2020, corresponding to the increase of seasonal flu. However, Google Trends volumes for \u201cfever\u201d and \u201ccough\u201d in 2020 seasonal flu period were, respectively, less than 50% and 65% of those referable to the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 4a, b). This observation suggests how COVID-19 might have a substantial impact on the occurrence of respiratory symptoms in the general population, thus corroborating the theory of a role for Google Trends in monitoring the dynamics of future COVID-19 evolution.",
