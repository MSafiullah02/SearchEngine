            "text": "CONCLUSION. CSS during CPAP 10 causes less ventilatory and circulatory changes when compared to open suctioning, but suctioning efficacy was minimal. If the hygienic aspects of CSS is taken into consideration, CSS at CPAP 0 cmH2O seems to be an alternative as secretion removal capacity and side effects are almost identical to those observed during open suctioning. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is a well established technique in the Intensive Care setting. A variety of techniques are used and the fibreoptic bronchoscope is usually recommended in order to confirm anatomical positioning of the tracheostomy. In our Intensive Care Units a routine chest x-ray is performed post PDT to check for position of the tracheostomy tube and perioperative complications. This is common practice, although its value has been questioned (1,2). METHODS. A retrospective audit of the intensive care medical notes and chest radiographs of patients who underwent endoscopically guided PDT at the South Tees Acute Hospital Trust Intensive Care Units between 1996 to 2001 was undertaken to determine the complication rates detected by routine radiology. Complications identified in the medical and nursing notes during and immediately after the procedure were documented. The most recent pre-procedure chest radiograph was compared with the post-procedure chest radiograph and changes noted. RESULTS. A total of 221 cases of PDT were identified and included in the study. The overall complication rate for PDT was 8.59%. The complications detected are listed in Table 1 .The routine post PDT chest radiograph detected complications in 1.8% of cases, 1 tube malposition, 2 new areas of lobe consolidation and confirmed pneumomediastinum in a patient with clinical subcutaneous emphysema noted before the radiograph had been taken. This pneumomediastinum was self-limiting and was thought to be due to several attempts at wire placement in a patient with high levels of PEEP using the blue rhino technique . CONCLUSION. The rate of complications post PDT documented in this study was low and compared favourably to the rates seen in other studies. Studies of non-endoscopically guided PDT have shown the incidence of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and paratracheal tube insertion to be much higher comparing to studies of endoscopically guided PDT (3). Most complications detected in our study, including the one case of self limiting pneumomediastinum, were identified clinically, rather than radiologically and chest radiography did not produce a significant change in the clinical management of any patients. We conclude that in adult uncomplicated endoscopically guided PDT there may be no need for routine post procedure chest x-ray. In complicated cases or in case of diffICUlty with needle placement of the trachea, a chest radiograph post PDT may still be required. We recommend that a further larger prospective randomised trial be performed. ",

            "text": "Traditionally patients with respiratory failure are ventilated to normocarbia using tidal volumes of 10-15 ml.kg-1. However, a 'protective' ventilatory strategy, using more modest tidal volumes and if necessary accepting a degree of respiratory acidosis may reduce mortality (1). Patients ventilated to a non-therapeutic respiratory alkalosis with high tidal volumes or peak pressures are therefore almost certainly exposed to an unnecessary risk. The purpose of this pilot study was to devise an audit technique that could be simply and easily used in most intensive care units to identify these \"at risk\" patients, and to determine if feedback of the audit results altered ventilation practice. METHODS. Ventilation practice was studied on the intensive care units of a teaching (University) and a district general hospital. 30 consecutive admissions to each unit, who were ventilated for > 24 hrs, were studied. Every 12 hrs for their entire stay ventilatory pressures, volumes and associated arterial blood gas results were recorded. Any data point where, in the context of a normal arterial pH (> 7.35), the associated tidal volume (TV) was > 11ml.kg-1, or the peak inflation pressure (PIP) was > 35cmH2O, was deemed inappropriate ventilation. The proportions of 'inappropriate ventilation' data points were calculated for each centre, with 95% confidence intervals assuming a binomial distribution. RESULTS. The initial results are shown in table 1 in the first two data columns. In the light of these findings, a simple protocol and education programme was introduced at the district hospital to increase the involvement of nursing staff in the set-up and adjustment of mechanical ventilators. Six months after this process was completed, ventilation at the district hospital was re-evaluated ( 13.0 \u00b1 1.0 18.0 \u00b1 1.5 25.2 \u00b1 1.2 35.0 \u00b1 0.4 TBird 11.8 \u00b1 0.6 16.1 \u00b1 0.8 23.9 \u00b1 2.1 32.6 \u00b1 1.7 Influence of ventilator output temperature on Absolute Humidity (cmH2O/l) CONCLUSION. HH provides less humidity when the ambient temperature is high (table 1, p=0.0004) and when the ventilator delivers a gas with a high temperature (table 2, p=0.02). In these situations patients are exposed to detrimental effects of underhumidied gas. New systems compensating for these effects need to be evaluated.",

We wanted to examine the relationship between the paCO2 levels in survivors and non-survivors in our group of critically ill patients requiring high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). METHODS.

The group was then split into hospital survivors (S) and non-survivors (NS). Mean paCO2 levels at 8 hourly intervals were then statistically analysed using a 2 way ANOVA test. RESULTS. Analysis of variance shows a highly significant difference in PaCO2 between the survivors (S) and non-survivors (NS) p < 0.0001.

Impairment of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange during and after anesthesia is partly caused by atelectasis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of modified \"alveolar recruitment strategy\" (1) on peri-and postoperative lung function. METHODS. 67 ASA I-III patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were prospectively studied. Group C (n = 34) received volume control ventilation with low level of positive endexpiratory pressure -PEEP (3 cm H2O). In the group ventilated with higher level of PEEP and recruitment maneuver -group RMP (n = 33) 15 minutes after induction of anesthesia higher level of PEEP was set (6-8 cm H2O according to body size) and modified recruitment maneuver (3 pressure limited breaths with inspiratory pressure 35 cm H2O, inspiratory time 1,5-2 s) was performed. Demographic data, type and length of operation, type of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia, co-morbidity, peroperative evolution of gas exchange (pulse oximetry, capnography), effective compliance of respiratory system, hemodynamic variables and postoperative incidence of hypoxemia (SpO2<90 % during oxygen therapy via face mask with inspiratory fraction of oxygen -FiO2<0,4), need for postoperative ventilation, incidence of other postoperative complications and length of hospital stay were recorded.

The decrease of MPO blood level was noted during first three days in all patients with necrotizing pancreatitis.

These data has potential interest because it seems that the potential benefited from treatment with drotrecogin alfa are the patients with higher scores, witch is associated with lesser values of Protein C and Antitrombin III. In conclusion we think that the institutions must have guidelines for its use (according with scores levels or protein C levels) as the drug will be expensive and is associated with a potential risk of bleeding.

            "text": "In order to evaluate the results of resuscitation maneuvers, most of the pressure-controlled models of experimental hemorrhagic shock are carried out under general anesthesia. However, it is well known that anesthesia in hemorrhagic shock is associated to altered tissue perfusion. The hemodynamic and metabolic effects of this complicating factor in experimental hemorrhagic shock have not been clearly evaluated. METHODS. Forty young pigs (Large-White), mean weight 25K, underwent invasive hemodynamic monitoring (Swan-Ganz /BESE), arterial and venous blood gases (IL-1640) and blood lactate (BL) determinations. All animals received Halothane and were kept on anesthetic surgical stage III and divided in two groups: GI (FiHalothane = 0,75\u00b10,25%) e GII (FiHalothane = 1,4\u00b10,25%). In each Group, 10 animals were bled to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 30mmHg in ten minutes. MAP was held constant thrughout the experiment by additional bloodletting. In each Group ten animals followed identical protocol except bleeding. Hemodynamic and metabolic data were recorded before hemorrhage and every ten minutes thereafter, up to two hours. No animal was transfused or given any type of fluid replacement. RESULTS. Baseline MAP before bleeding exhibited significant difference between groups (GI = 88,10\u00b114,03mmHg versus GII = 67,00\u00b14,19mmHg. After bleeding, despite the fact that both Groups were kept at a MAP of 30mmHg, cardiac output (CO) in GI exhibited significant reduction, as early as twenty minutes after bleeding. Similarly it was observed a significant reduction in Base Excess in the blood (BEb) and an increase in BL, as well as in the venousarterial PCO2 difference (Delta-PCO2) and in the arterial-venous pH difference (Delta-pH). All animals in GI died up to eighty minutes after bleeding. (1). We evaluated the distribution of fluid in body compartment after administration of HES 130/0.4 and of standard starch formulation(HES 200/0.5)using a bioelectrical impedance method,that measuring resistive forces (Rz) that tissues oppose to electricity flow,allows a non invasive assessment of total body water and extracellular water(ECW)(2). METHODS. 23 patients admitted to ICU for postoperative monitoring after major abdominal surgery were studied. Hystory of allergy and of renal insufficiency were exclusion criteria.Patients(male=12 female=11 mean age 68\u00b15 omogeneous for SAPS II) were randomly subdivided in two groups:G1(n=12)received HES 130/0.4,G2(n=11)received HES 200/0.5 as the exclusive artificial colloid(10ml/kg in 30min)for profilaxis of hypovolemia.Cristalloids were added as needed to mantain fluid balance.For bioelectrical impedance analysis two surfacestimulating electrodes were applied distally to metacarpal and metatarsal line.Two sensor electrodes were applied on the omolateral wrist and ankle.Applaying an alternate current (50 hertz, 800 mA) the device (STA/BIA RJL Akern System Florence Italy) measures the bioimpedance that is proportional to the tissue water content.A new software arrangement allows to measure the ECW without considering the height of the patient.The measurements were conducted before the administration of colloids (T0) and then every 6 hours for 24 hours (T1=6h T2=12h T3=18h T4=24h). In all patients invasive BP, PVC and urine output were monitored.Results were compared (ANOVA) between the two groups.Untoward effects were recorded. RESULTS. Results are expressed as mean\u00b1SD.Basal Rz (G1=561\u00b148 G2=589\u00b133 Ohms) and ECW(G1=44\u00b15 G2=43\u00b13 %) do not show statistical intra nor inter group differences. In all patients Rz was increased (G1=965\u00b134 G2=943\u00b154 Ohms)and ECW was reduced G1= 35\u00b13 G2=37\u00b12 %) at T1, T2 and at T3 (p<0,01) while at T4 Rz and ECW were back to basal values. G1 patients showed values of ECW slightly lower at T1,T2 and T3 compared to G2 patients but this difference was not statistically significant.Hemodynamic stability was mantained in all patients,PVC remains stable and urine output was 1-2 ml/kg/h throughout the study period. No untoward effects were detected. CONCLUSION. The 6% HES 130/0.4 was as effective as 6% HES 200/0.5 in mantaining hemodynamic stability. Although the renal elimination of HES 130/0.4 is more rapid and complete, volume effect is similar in terms of entity and of duration,as demonstrated by bioelectrical impedance. We conclude that HES 130/0.4 is as effective as HES 200/0.5 but,due to its more favorable pharmacokinetic profile, it seems an useful alternative to standard HES formulations, althought further studies in a larger number of patients are needed to confirm our results. INTRODUCTION. Blood lactate concentrations are reliable predictors of survival in circulatory shock, but the significance of hyperlactatemia in septic shock has been challenged. The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic value of blood lactate / pyruvate (L/P) ratio to lactate concentrations in the first 24 hours of shock treatment.",

By increasing myocardial contractility and inducing vasodilation, levosimendan increases cardiac output and decreases preload while having no significant effect on oxygen consumption. The cardiovascular effects of 24-and 48-hour infusions of levosimendan in patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure were determined. METHODS. In phase 1, patients received either levosimendan (n=98) in increasing doses up to a maximum of 0.4 microg/kg/minute, or placebo (n=48). Patients who received levosimendan in phase 1 continued to do so at half the original dose for the following 18 hours (phase 2). In phase 3, patients were again randomised to receive either levosimendan (LS+; n=42) or placebo (LS-; n=43), which were infused for a further 24 hours at the same rate given during phase 2. Haemodynamic measurements and cardiac performance were determined using a right-sided Swan-Ganz catheter and thermodilution, respectively, at 6, 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS. Significant increases in cardiac output and stroke volume, and decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, right atrial pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were observed in patients after a 6-hour infusion of levosimendan compared to placebo (p<0.001). Improved symptoms of heart failure paralleled the enhanced haemodynamics observed. At 24 h, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p<0.001) and systemic vascular resistance (p=0.033) had decreased further compared to measurements at 6 h (Table 1) . Stroke volume and cardiac output increased but not significantly. The enhanced haemodynamic parameters and cardiac performance observed at 6 and 24 h were maintained at 48 h, regardless of treatment received during phase 2 ( Table 1 ). The sustained benefits observed at 48 h may be associated with increased plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of LS, OR-1896, seen in both treatment groups (7.2\u00b14.6 and 6.2\u00b13.6 ng/ml, respectively).

However, the selection of drugs, aims of treatment and strategies for monitoring may vary considerably between different ICU's. This survey was performed to analyse the rationale for use and monitoring of vasopressor/inotropic drug therapy in Scandinavian ICU's. An Internet based reporting system was implemented using the recently formed Scandinavian Critical Care Trials Group as a communication platform. METHODS. 223 ICU's were identified in the Scandinavian countries and invited to participate in a one-day point prevalence study. An Internet based database was constructed and a practice survey protocol designed to identify haemodynamic monitoring, indications for vasopressor/inotropic therapy, fluids for volume loading, pre-treatment circulatory state and actual and targeted haemodynamic variables. Patients were eligible for the study if on vasopressor/inotropic therapy for more than 4 hours. The inclusion time was 8 am to 5 pm during a weekday. RESULTS. 114 ICU's (51 university, 22 regional, 41 community hospitals), representing 925 ICU beds, reported 114 adult patients matching the inclusion criteria. 67% of the patients had received vasopressor/inotropic support for > 24 hrs and 32 % received more than one drug. Arterial hypotension (92%) and oliguria (50%) were the far most common indications for therapy in adults even when patients were subgrouped for main diagnostic category (sepsis, trauma, cardiac failure, postoperative etc). Fluid loading prior to therapy was reported in 87% of cases with Acetated Ringer (47%), saline (41%), starches (48%), dextrane (27 %), albumin (18%) and plasma (33%). Dopamine (47%) and noradrenaline (44%) were the most commonly used drugs followed by dobutamine (24%). Dopamine doses < 3 ug/kg/min were seen in less than 5%. No other drug exceeded 10 %. Non-catecholamine drugs were rarely used even in cardiac failure patients. Dopamine and noradrenaline were the most commonly (47%) combined inotropic drugs. In accordance with indications, mean arterial pressure was the most commonly used target aiming at MAP 60-69 mm Hg (37%) and 70-79 mm Hg (50%). In more than 95% of patients, invasive arterial pressure monitoring was used and central venous pressured was measured in 90% of patients. Pulmonary artery catheters were used in 19%. Other cardiac output monitoring techniques (Picco, CO2 rebreathing, aortic Doppler etc) were used in 7% of the patients.",

The aim of this study was to state the incidence of those experiences in the patients with ICU-stay longer than 3 days and the relationship between presence of HND and clinical variables. METHODS. Adult (>18y) ICU survivors without history of major affective disorders, who were consecutively admitted during 1 year and stayed in ICU at least 3 days, were interviewed one week after ICU discharge. To investigate the recall of intensive care, the ICU Memory Tool [2] was administered. Past medical history and clinical variables, including the sedatives administered in ICU, were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests and logistic regression. RESULTS. Out of the 100 patients enrolled in the study, 84 (median SAPS II 34) were interviewed. No difference was found between patients interviewed and non-interviewed. Five patients (5.9%) were confused and did not remember to have been in ICU, leaving 79 patients for the subsequent analysis. Thirty-seven patients (46.8%) reported at least one of HND: 12 reported only hallucinations, 6 only nightmares, 6 only dreams and 13 patients more than one of those memories. Patients reporting at least one of HND had significantly more frequently infection than those without HND (21 of 37 that is 56.8% vs 16 of 42 that is 26.2%; p=0.007) and also higher maximal body temperature (38.2\u00b10.6 vs 37.7\u00b10.8, respectively; p=0.004). The propofol was administered to 14 of 37 (37.8%) patients with HND and to 4 of 42 (9.5%) cases without HND (p=0.003); the physical restrain was adopted in 13 of 37 (35.1%) and in 5 of 42 (11.9%), respectively (p=0.017). The logistic regression analysis showed that only temperature of at least 38\u00b0C was significantly associated with HND memories (coefficient beta 1.656; p<0.004). The odds ratio was 2.5 (CI95% 1.6-4.1). Nearly all of HND were visual; animals and feelings involving the environment were the most frequent experiences. CONCLUSION. Nearly half of the patients staying in ICU longer than 3 days have at least one of HND. The patients with fever (temperature of at least 38\u00b0C) during the ICU stay are 2.5 times more likely to report HND memories after discharge from the ICU. ",

Little is known, however about the outcome when such patients become critically ill but not admitted to ICU. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence and outcome of critical illness in the total population of patients admitted to hospital with haematological malignancy. METHODS. Objective criteria for critical illness and for referral to ICU were prospectively defined. Consecutive patients admitted to hospital under the care of the Division of Haematooncology during 2001 were screened. Patients who became critically ill and who, at the time were receiving active management were enrolled and followed throughout their hospital admission. SAPS II and organ failure scores, calculated at the time of fulfilling study entry criteria, treatment and hospital outcome were recorded. RESULTS. There were 1437 haemato-oncology inpatient episodes, during the study period, of which 101 (97 patients 53M; 44F) were complicated by critical illness. The median age was 55 (range 19-81) and median length of hospital stay was 18 days (range 0-87). These 101 episodes resulted in 49 referrals to the intensive care team (ICT) of whom 24 patients were admitted to ICU (26 admissions). Reasons for ICU admission included continuous invasive monitoring, noninvasive or invasive positive pressure ventilation, high dose inotropes and continuous renal support. Hospital mortalities were: 47% (47/101) overall; 53% (26/49) for those referred to the ICT; 75% (18/24) for those admitted to ICU; 32% (8/25) for those referred to the ICT but managed on the ward jointly and 40% (21/52) for those critically ill patients not referred to the ICT. Treatment limitations had been implemented in all 21 patients who died without referral to the ICT. On univariate analysis those referred to ICU were younger (p<0.05), more likely to have respiratory (p<0.01) and haematological failure (p<0.05) but had similar SAPS II scores (mean 49.8 v 45.7, NS) on inclusion. There was a mean of 1.8 (range 0-5) organ failures per patient at the time of study inclusion. As has been demonstrated for patients on ICU, there was a close relationship between actual mortality and that predicted by SAPS II, for the whole population of critically ill patients, including those managed on the ward. All patients with 4 or more organ failures or SAPS II greater than 65 died.",

On the basis of predominantly retrospective studies the benefit of this routine procedure is controversial. We prospectively evaluated the results of RCXr's performed after insertion of a CVC in the SVC. METHODS. In our ICU a RCXr is performed after insertion of a CVC in the SVC. After insertion of a CVC in the SVC a questionnaire was completed by the performing physician. Beside demographic data the following items were scored;1. Procedure: easy (1 or 2 attempts), diffICUlt (3 or more attempts), complicated, not successful. 2. Chest X-ray: abnormal findings related to insertion CVC?. 3. Classification chest X-ray: 3A. No abnormal findings related to insertion CVC, no therapeutic intervention. 3B. Abnormal findings related to insertion CVC, no therapeutic intervention. 3C. Abnormal findings related to insertion of CVC, therapeutic intervention. 4. Did complications related to the CVC procedure arise after the RCXr was performed?. 5. Also, the following question had to be answered directly after the procedure before the RCXr was made: if no RCXr would have been performed, would the physician have ordered a post-procedural chest X-ray to rule out complications or to check the position of the line? No/Yes, specify. RESULTS. A total of 232 CVC procedures performed by residents, fellows and staff were evaluated, 198 concerning the subclavian vein and 34 the internal jugular vein. Of the 232 procedures 155 were scored as easy, 40 diffICUlt, 29 complicated and 16 not successful. Complications consisted of pneumothorax 4, arterial punction 11, haematoma 5, arrhythmia 7, failure to advance guide wire 2. Abnormal findings on the 232 RCXr related to the insertion procedure were encountered 27 times consisting of 22 catheter malpositions, 1 pleural fluid collection and 4 pneumothorax. The RCXr's were classified as follows; A: 205, B: 1, C: 26. In 2 cases complications (pneumothorax) were diagnosed after RCXr. Subsequent to 40 procedures the performing physician stated that he/she would have specifically ordered a post procedural chest Xray. Of the RCXr following these procedures 5 were classified as 3C. Of the RCXr's following the other 192 procedures 19 were classified as 3C. Of the 4 cases of pneumothorax 1 was suspected by the performing physician after a complicated procedure, 1 was seen on the RXCr after an easy procedure and 2 were not visible on the RCXr after an easy procedure and were diagnosed later. CONCLUSION. Abnormal findings with therapeutic consequences were seen in 27/232 RCXr's. The assessment of the procedure by the performing physician was not helpful in predicting post procedural complications. Two of 4 pneumothorax were not visible on the post-procedural RCXr. Our data justify a (prospective) investigation of omitting RCXr after a CVC in the SVC.",

The pressure-time product for inspiratory muscles (PTP: index of muscle energy expenditure), arterial blood gases, comfort, clinical and ventilatory parameters were monitored at each period. Results are presented as median (5th-95th centile). Differences were evaluated with a Wilcoxon matchedpairs test. A p value 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS. Both ventilatory settings decreased Pdi swings and PTP. The most important decrease in inspiratory muscle load was observed during PS15/PEEP5. Highest PaO2/FIO2 variation was observed for PS10/PEP10.

The report of the working group recommends that: 1. Every acute hospital should develop a non-invasive ventilatory service for the management of patients with acute respiratory failure. 2. One hospital within a geographical area should develop a specialist non-invasive ventilatory service to which patients suffering from delayed weaning can be referred. 3.

The subjects were artificially restricted by elastic strapping of the trunk and were offered pressure support (PS). In comparison, they also breathed an ETT with two lumina, designed to separately extend both limbs of the ventilator tubing into the trachea (DL-ETT), thus eliminating DS and inspiratory resistance associated with conventional SL-ETTs.

They breathed spontaneously via mouthpiece, HME and pneumotachygraph (PT) with pressure tab(CO2SMO+, Novametrix) on an EVITA2 ventilator (Draeger) without CPAP. Abdomen and lower thorax were strapped by elastic bandages approximately doubling chest wall elastance. 5 different ways of connecting to the ventilator were applied for approx. 10min each in random order: 1) tubing, y-piece, mainstream capnometre (CO2SMO+), SL-ETT (Mallinckrodt 10 contour, 8,5 I.D.); 2)+ HME between SL-ETT and capnometre; 3)+XT; 4) +HME +XT; 5) DL-ETT instead of SL-ETT and y-piece (capnometre of PT).

Sixteen patients (27.58%) had neurological disease, twenty-three patients (39.65%) had respiratory disease and nineteen patients (32.76%) formed an heterogeneous group. In 45 patients (77%) tracheostomy was performed and it was decided by physician in charge. Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1: patients with no tracheostomy. Group 2: patients whith tracheostomy performed before the 10th day. Group 3: patients whith tracheostomy after the 10th day.

While in 1996 almost 50% of patients transfered from the ICU died in-hospital, this number could be reduced to 12,5% in 2000. At the time of data collection (october 2001) 26% of patients from 1996, 51% from 1997, 38% from 1998, 44% from 1999 and 63% from 2000 were alive. QOL among survivors wasCONCLUSION. The findings of our study indicate that the outcome after long-term ICU stay and the QOL is good. In-hospital mortality after ICU was markedly decreased.

Traditionally mortality has been the main indicator of ICU outcome.This view is being challenged [1]. There is increasing interest in assessing quality of life and psychological outcome after intensive care (IC)[2]. Quality of life, functional outcome and psycological state are poorly documented compared to mortality data. As clinicians look beyond mortality, quality of life in survivors will assume even greater importance. Recent studies suggest that post discharge quality of life scores are reduced compared to pre-admission values and that incidence of post traumatic stress disorder is as high as 27% [3].CONCLUSION. 1. Intensive Care follow up clinic is a useful method of assessing quality outcomes for the IC survivor. 2. The majority of our followed up survivors have no 'step down' in either place of residence, quality of life, mobility, or social life. This is more encouraging than previously published data. 3. The provision of early follow up, ITU diaries for those with memory loss, multi-disciplinary referrals and a forum to address patient anxieties may partially explain our very low survivor stress scores. 4. More research is needed into psychological outcomes.REFERENCES. 1. SA Ridley, Critical Care Outcomes. Anaesthesia 2001 56:1-3. 2. RD Griffith, C Jones. Recovery from Intensive Care.

The criteria for eligibility were a respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, a PaCO2/FiO2 ratio < 200 while the patient was breathing oxygen through a Ventury mask; and active contraction of the accessory respiratory muscle. All patients were ventilated with NIMV via a facial mask. Strict intubation criteria were adopted for failures. The success of the technique was defined as avoiding endotracheal intubation and patients survive at least 24 hours outside ICU.RESULTS.Over a period of 61 months, 176 patients with pre-selected criteria were enrolled. Seventy-seven (43.8%) were men. Mean age was 73\u00b1 9 years and the initial SAPS II 45\u00b114. There was a history of ischemic heart disease in 53.4% and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 36.4%. The NIMV was successful in 130 patients (73.9%), mortality was 21.6% in ICU and 31.8% during hospitalization . By multivariate analysis, the variables related to NIMV failure and in-hospital mortality were: SHOCK at admission: Odds Ratio (OR)= 3.289, CI-95%=1.CONCLUSION. The use of NIMV has a great rate of success in acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The factors associated with technique' failure are hemodinamic instability, AMI as aetiology, great necessity of EPAP, PaCO2 at admission, and evolution of PaO2/FiO2 ratio one hour after NIMV and the severity of organic dysfunction.PHYSIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF FIVE INTERFACES DURING NON-INVASIVE VENTILATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTSLellouche F. 1 , Fraticelli A. 1 , Taill\u00e9 S. 1 , Deye N. 1 , L'Her E. 1 , Demoule A. 1 , Alvarez A. 1 , Abadie Y. 1 , Brochard L. 1 , Mancebo J. 2 1 Medical ICU, Henri Mondor Hospital, Cr\u00e9teil, France, 2 Medical ICU, Sant Pau University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain INTRODUCTION.

A. 1 1 Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Ippokration General Hospital, Thessaloniki, GreeceINTRODUCTION. The incidence of systemic fungal infections in patients requiring intensive care unit has increased in recent years with fungi being the fifth most predominant nosocomial pathogen (1,2). Infections may evolve from endogenous colonization of the gastrointestinal tract as well as from nosocomial exogenous transmission. The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence,location and outcome of nosocomial fungal infections (NFI) in our PICU and their relation to risk factors. METHODS. We prospectively examined 94 consecutive PICU patients (pts), 59M/35F with LOS>72h. Screening cultures obtained from fharynx, gastric fluid, stool, blood, urine, tracheobronchial aspirates (in case of intubation)on admission and every 4 days thereafter until discharge. Data collected:age(mo), illness severity score (PRISM III 24h), risk factors(gastrointestinal tract colonization, broad spectrum antibiotic usage, immunosupression, prior hospital admission), MV(days), LOS(days),outcome. RESULTS. 19 (20.2%) pts developed NFI. 4 pts had candidaemia, 3 pts had pulmonary infections with asrergillus (1pt among them had also CNS infection with aspergillus), 12 pts had urinary tract infections with candida spp (table 1).All pts with candidaemia respond well to antifungus therapy. 7/19 pts with NFI died (3 from systemic mycosis, 4 from main disease) compared to 8/75 pts without NFI (p:0.005, x square test).18/19 pts with NFI had prior hospital admissions compared to 35/75 without NFI (p:0.0001, x square test).11/19 pts with NFI had colonization of the gastrointestinal tract compared to 7/75 without NFI (p:0.0001, x square test).Table 1(*statistical significant t test for independent samples, **statistical significant x square test). CONCLUSION. Patients with NFI had higher illness severity score, spend more days on MV and stayed in PICU longer. They showed statistical significance for risk factors, prior hospital admission, gastrointestinal tract colonization and had worse outcome. Certain high risk pts may benefit for prophylaxis, early preemptive or empirical therapy. REFERENCES. 1.The Management of Fungal Infection in the ICU.

The potential role of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) as an alternative to conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in hypoxemic acute respiratory failure is controversial. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and resource consumption of NIMV versus CMV in patients with severe acute respiratory failure. METHODS. A multicentre randomised controlled trial in 7 medical ntensive care units (ICU) on patients with acute respiratory failure who needed mechanical ventilation according to criteria previously set. The intervention group was treated with NIVM with facial mask in pressure support ventilation plus positive end expiratory pressure. The control group received CMV with intubation. Resource use was assessed by length of stay in the ICU and hospital and the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28). RESULTS. We enrolled 31 patients in the NIMV group and 33 in the CMV group. The two groups were similar in all baseline measurements. The causes for respiratory failure were pneumonia (18), acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17), acute pulmonary edema (16), bronchospasm (4), and others (9). Mean PaO2:FiO2 ratio was 120 (standard deviation -SD-62) and mean APACHE II score was 24.8 (SD 8.3 ). In the NIMV group 18 patients received endotracheal intubation (58%) against 33 from the CMV group (100%)relative risk reduction 43% (95% confidence interval: 27%, 55%, P=0.00003). Mortality in the ICU was 23% (NIMV) and 39% (CMV) (relative risk reduction 47%, 95% confidence interval: -10%, 74%, P=0.09). Mortality in hospital was 32% (NIMV) and 42% (CMV) (relative risk reduction 27%, 95% confidence interval: -34%, 61%, P=0.30). Complications during stay in ICU occurred in 52% (NIMV) and 70% (CMV) (P=0.07) of patients. Functional outcome at ICU discharge measured by the Barthel index was similar in the two groups. Geometric means of ICU lengths of stay were 8.9 -SD 2.6-days (NIMV) and 9.7-SD 3.0-days (CMV), (P=0.69) and geometric means of hospital length of stay were 20.3 -SD 2.2-days (NIMV) and 16.8 -SD 2.8days (CMV), (P=0.42). TISS-28 showed differences in the first day -medians (range), 27 (22 a 60) (NIMV) and 32 (28 a 46) (CMV) (P=0.007)-, and in the first three days, 27.7 (15.3 a 56.3) (NIMV) and 31 (23.3 a 46.7) (CMV) (P=0.03). CONCLUSION. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation decreases the need for intubation in severe acute respiratory failure and could improve survival in ICU and hospital and reduce complications during stay in ICU. When compared with conventional mechanical ventilation non-invasive mechanical ventilation decreases the amount of therapeutic interventions in the first treatment days but does not decrease the length of stay.

Non invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) may provide effective ventilatory support in selected patients with acute or exacerbation's of chronic respiratory failure, avoiding the risk of endotracheal intubation (1). A large numbers of failures, that prematurely stops the NIMV, are due to patient's intolerance to the face mask. A new device the \"helmet\" has been developed to deliver NIMV. The helmet, by avoiding a direct contact with the face, may increase the patient's tolerance and increase the length of NIMV. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the new helmet versus a standard face mask.",

The level of PEEP and pressure support were set at 5 cmH2O. CONCLUSION. Using this system it is possible to obtain a more precise description of pulmonary gas exchange than the usual clinical standard, i.e. calculation of effective shunt. The experimental procedure is simple and has short duration, and as such this system may have application in several clinical settings, including the ICU, guiding clinical decisions. ",

Limitations are related to the need of a specific training and equipment cost. Hand-held echocardiography is an emergent technique which is attractive when considering its relatively low cost and portability. We sought to evaluate the diagnostic capability and therapeutic impact of transthoracic hand-held echocardiography (HHE) in critically ill patients in a general ICU. METHODS. Over a 4-month period, all patients requiring a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were studied. Attending physicians adressed well-defined clinical questions. All HHE studies were performed by the same investigator, experienced in echocardiography (Optigo, Philips Ultrasound: 9 x 23 x 33 cm; 3.5 kgs). This device provides two-dimensional imaging and allows color-Doppler mapping, but has no ECG, M-mode, and spectral Doppler. Subsequently, a conventional TTE study (Sonos 5500\u00ae, Philips Ultrasound) was independently performed by a second investigator trained in echocardiography who was unaware of HHE results. TTE was used as the gold standard imaging modality. The number of acoustic windows and duration of the procedure were noted. Diagnostic capability was defined by the percentage of responses to clinical problems and therapeutic impact corresponded to changes in acute care which resulted directly from the procedure. RESULTS. 125 consecutive patients, including 92 under ventilator (74%), were studied (age: 60\u00b118 years; IGSII: 45\u00b113). Among them, 85 (68%) were admitted in the ICU for a medical condition, 25 (20%) for complicated surgery, and the remaining 15 (12%) for multisystem trauma.

In selected patients this non-invasive system might replace invasive CO measurements during the perioperative period.INTRODUCTION. Mucosal PCO2 measured by gastric tonometry has been correlated with splanchnic hypoperfusion in shock. This technique is cumbersome and not practical to apply in the acute trauma setting (1). In an effort to identify other more accessible tissue beds for tissue perfusion monitoring, our laboratory had demonstrated that skeletal muscle (SM) tissue acidosis correlated significantly with the severity of blood loss during shock using multiparameter tissue monitoring (2). In this study we hypothesized that Subcutaneous tissue (SQ) changes (pH, PCO2 and PO2) are comparable to changes seen in bowel tonometry and SM tissue during shock and resuscitation; therefore providing valuable surrogate information in the assessment of the mesenteric circulation during hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation. METHODS. Thirteen male mini swine (25-35 kg) (n=4 control, n=9 shock) underwent laparotomy and jejunal tonometry. Multi-parameter sensors (Diametrics Medical, MN) were placed in the chest SQ and the adductor muscle of the leg. PaCO2 was maintain between 40 and 45 mm Hg. Hemorrhaged Animals were kept at MAP of 40mm Hg by infusing or withdrawing blood as needed. Animals were bled until decompensation (Decomp) (Reinfusion of more than 10% of the maximum shed blood was required to maintain the MAP at 40 mm Hg). Animals were resuscitated with shed blood + 2X shed volume in LR (20 min) and observed for 3 hrs. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (Tuckey's), paired t tests and Fisher Z value. ",

Over a period of 5 consecutive years a total of 119 nonimmunosuppressed patients (78 men and 41 women aged 60,7 \u00b1 17,6 years) were admitted to our ICU with a diagnosis of CAP. The causal agent was determined in 43 cases (36,1%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the most frequently isolated microorganism, accounting for 8 cases (6,7%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (5,9%), Streptoccocus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp (4,2% each). Candida spp, MSSA, Legionella pneumophila and Moraxella catarrhalis were responsible for the remaining 10 cases of severe CAP. In 6 cases (5,0%) multiple agents were identified. Etiology was determined exclusively by microbiology of tracheal aspirate in 24 patients and the remaining cases by blood cultures, BAL and serologic methods. Median ICU length of stay was 8,5 days. A total of 112 patients (94,1%) required mechanical ventilation for a median period of 6,2 days. 46 patients (38,7%) developed sepsis or septic shock and 17 (14,3%) required RRT for renal failure.

The cumulative and the maximum numbers of administered antibiotics, and the duration of administration were related to the number of antibiotics which the patients were already receiving upon admission, the PRISM and TISS, the primary disease and its complications during the course of hospitalization, the development of nosocomial infections with positive cultures, the presence of chronic disease or immunodeficiency, various interventional techniques (mechanical ventilation, central catheters), and other clinical and demographic factors. RESULTS. During the 6-month period, 174 patients of mean age 5\u00b1.4 (.6-19) years were admitted to the PICU, with length of stay 8.8\u00b11.6 days, mechanical ventilation 6.1\u00b11.4 days, PRISM 11\u00b1.7, TISS 24.6\u00b11.0 and hospital mortality rate 9.8%. The patients received antibiotics for a total of 950 days (62.3% of the length of stay days). While in PICU, 34 patients did not receive antimicrobial treatment (19.5%), 69 received one antibiotic (39.7%), 42 two (24.1%), 17 three (9.8%), and 12 more than three (6.9%), including agents against fungi and viruses. The cumulative summary of antibiotics, which the patients had received during their stay in PICU, was significantly related to the positive cultures (p<.0001) and represented 79.3% of the patients, compared to the 67.2% of the same patients who were receiving antibiotics on the day before admission (p<.0001). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that independent determinants of the cumulative number of antibiotics were: prior administration of antibiotics (p<.0001), the presence of a bloodstream infection (p<.0001), positive bronchial cultures (p<.0001), a negative outcome (p<.0001), development of MOSF (p=.002), immunodeficiency (p<.001), the PRISM (p<.03) and the number of central catheters (p<.03). The maximum daily number of antibiotics was also associated with the TISS (p=.007), while the duration of antibiotic coverage was additionally related to the length of stay (p<.0001).CONCLUSION. Prior antimicrobial therapy should be recognized as an important risk factor for extended antimicrobial therapy among critically ill children. Additionally, clinical efforts aimed at reducing antimicrobial treatment in critically ill patients, are restricted by the significant proportion of immunocompromised or cancer patients, patients with prolonged length of stay, the increased degree of interventions and development of nosocomial infections. The antibiotic usage in PICU, however, may be restricted and remain at entry levels by imposing definite clinical indications, guided by microbial studies.",

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of death and acquired disability among children and young adults in developed countries, and even when adequate treatment is provided, TBI commonly causes neuronal loss.

However, it has been shown to have complications, most notably of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation, which is more severe and prolonged in patients with high oxygenation indices (1, 2). METHODS. This study compared the effects of a new NB -BAL technique to an historical collection of data using an old technique. In the historical group, the suction catheter was passed through an open system so that oxygenation, but not airway pressure was maintained (\"unsealed\" method). For the new technique the catheter was passed through a diaphragm placed in such a way that positive pressure ventilation continued during NB -BAL (\"sealed\" method). RESULTS. NB -BAL was performed on 35 patients in one Paediatric Intensive Care Unit using the \"unsealed\" technique and two years later on 35 patients using the \"sealed\" method. There was no statistical difference between the groups with regard to demographic data or oxygenation and ventilatory requirements (p>0,05). The \"sealed\" NB -BAL group experienced significantly less decrease in oxyhaemoglobin saturation during the procedure (p<0,05). Patients with oxygenation indices >10 experienced the most severe desaturation events in both groups. Significantly fewer patients with high oxygenation indices in the \"sealed\" group experienced severe desaturations to <80% as compared with the \"unsealed\" group (p<0,05). -6.0 (50.0) -13.0 (63.0) 0.03 * Results expressed as median (range). * indicates significance at p<0,05 using the Mann -Whitney U Test CONCLUSION. The NB -BAL method of maintaining positive pressure ventilation reduces the severity of desaturation during the procedure. Patients with high oxygenation indices, however, are still at risk of severe desaturation and precautions should be taken. It is recommended that the new technique be adopted to improve the safety of this procedure. ",
