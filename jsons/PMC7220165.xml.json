ACE2 counterbalances the effects of AT1 activation by angiotensin II as part of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS). Lei Fang and colleagues1 hypothesised that cardiometabolic diseases (eg, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac diseases) and RAAS inhibitors (eg, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]) might increase the risk of COVID-19 by upregulating ACE2. However, this provocative hypothesis and subsequent debate have occurred in the absence of any empirical evidence that cardiometabolic diseases or RAAS inhibitors affect ACE2 expression in human lungs.",

We related gene expression to each comorbidity or medication using a robust linear model.

Neither cardiometabolic diseases (individually or in composite) nor ARBs were associated with altered expression of these genes (figure\n; appendix pp 3\u20135), suggesting any increased risk of COVID-19 in these subpopulations is not related to upregulation of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor or cofactors in the lung; although, their expression in the rest of the respiratory tract still needs to be studied. In contrast to studies in other tissue types,4 we found that ACEIs reduce ACE2 expression in lung. It is possible that long-term ACEI use downregulates lung ACE2 expression by reducing substrate (ie, angiotensin II) availability, which might also explain why no effect of ARBs was seen. In theory, ACE2 downregulation might reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of reduced virus receptor availability. However, animal models suggest that ACE2 deficiency could exaggerate acute lung injury because of an imbalance in angiotensin II or AT1 signalling.5 The clinical significance of our finding is therefore unknown.",

COPD was associated with increased ACE2 expression in the Lung eQTL Study, a finding that was replicated in the Lung Tissue Research Consortium and St Paul's Hospital cohort. The association between COPD and ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 expression was inconsistent across the datasets (figure; appendix pp 3\u20135). Whether this increased expression translates to increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown because there is no in-vivo evidence that increased receptor availability increases viral entry. Additionally, COPD was associated with decreased expression of ACE and AGTR1 in the Lung eQTL Study, and its association with decreased AGTR1 expression was replicated in the Lung Tissue Research Consortium dataset (figure; appendix pp 3\u20135). The combination of increased ACE2 but decreased ACE or AGTR1 expression might be protective against acute lung injury,7 which could explain why there is no clear excess of patients with COPD among severe COVID-19 cases.6\n",
