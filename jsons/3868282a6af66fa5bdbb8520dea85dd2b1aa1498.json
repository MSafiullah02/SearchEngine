Although current data is lacking on specific demographics of testing, minority groups and marginalized communities may have had less access to initial testing. Health care providers' implicit racial bias could also influence their decision about who receives a diagnostic coronavirus test or triage. Public health and social media messaging about staying home if ill, coupled with longstanding disenfranchisement from health care access, may have resulted in treatment delays leading to worse outcomes (29, 30) . In NYC, it became clear that the most vulnerable under-resourced safety-net hospitals serving the most affected communities were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 quickly overloaded. Factors such as resource allocation, geographic location, and public versus private hospital systems have influenced access to necessary supplies and COVID-19 testing.

Being honest about our individual implicit biases (since we all have them) is critical.

These efforts include conducting climate assessments, using evidence-based questionnaires, giving leaders feedback on that data, and providing ongoing training (50) . It is imperative to harness our energy to research and develop ways to diminish the heightened impact of glaring health care disparities and discrimination the pandemic has brought to the forefront. COVID-19 has exposed the tragic vulnerabilities of many of our patients and communities but has also revealed the depth of resiliency in providers, in community organizations, and in our cancer patients. Our experience addressing COVID-19 disparities in gynecologic cancer patients can translate to a more holistic dialogue about health equity, bringing all stakeholders to the discussion. We all experience a health benefit if the health outcomes of those at the margins improve.
