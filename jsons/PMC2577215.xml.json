Lam and co-workers [28] have described this \u2018one-bead one-compound\u2019 approach of generating a peptide library on 80 \u03bcm beads. Libraries were screened against receptors conjugated to fluorescent dyes or reporter enzymes. This approach eventually merged with the new DNA microarray technology in the late 1990s, creating the first type of chemical microarray with many pioneering studies performed in Schreiber's laboratory at Harvard 13, 14, 15, 16. This platform, usually called a small-molecule microarray (SMM), uses diverse linking techniques to immobilize chemical compounds with specific moieties covalently coupled to the surface of glass 8, 9, and then screens the compounds against chosen biotargets (Figure 1\n).",

They have synthesized 3780 structurally complex 1,3-dioxane small molecules using \u2018one-bead one-stock-solution\u2019 technology, and microarrayed them on glass slides. This SMM was then screened with fluorescently (Cy5) labeled yeast prion-like protein Ure2p, a repressor of transcription factors for Nil1p and Gln3. One out of eight hits from the primary binding screening had activity in a secondary cell-based screening assay, with a dissociation constant (K\nd) value of 18.1 \u03bcM. After SAR analysis, a small group of derivatives was synthesized, based on the lead structure, and a second-generation compound emerged with better solubility and an improved K\nd of 7.5 \u03bcM. Interestingly, this compound selectively activated only the Nil1p-dependent glucose-sensitive signaling pathway, but not the Gln3-dependent nitrogen nutrient-responsive signaling pathway. This research effectively utilized DNA microarray and chemical microarray technologies and demonstrated that chemical microarray technology can be a powerful tool for selecting chemical ligands with high binding activities to perturb bioactivities.",

            "text": "However, immobilizing a large diversified chemical library has many limitations. As a result, scientists from Graffinity Pharmaceuticals have created a fragment chemical microarray system that immobilizes a few thousand drug fragments or pharmacophores (http://www.graffinity.com/t_elements.php#). In this unique platform, the low-complexity drug-like compounds are synthesized and immobilized on microarrays with a specially designed self-assembled monolayer (SAM), and a thin gold layer provides the base for this SAM and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The microarray chips are then treated with the biological target without labeling. A Plasmon Imager\u00ae, based on the phenomenon of SPR, is then used to record the mass change generated by soluble proteins bound on immobilized chemical surfaces. A wavelength shift in the SPR setting, corresponding to the amount of proteins bound to the chemical surface, helps to create the protein\u2013ligand affinity fingerprints. With this approach, drug-like fragments with high binding affinity towards protein targets were quickly identified [33] (Figure 2\n). Compared with more-traditional small-molecule screening, binding affinity is generally weaker in this system (K\nd values in \u03bcM range) but the percentage of fragments capable of binding to particular proteins is higher. The quality of the lead compounds will also depend heavily on how the initial screening data are interpreted. Therefore, Graffinity has created a whole process that is termed RAISE\u00ae (rapid array informed structure evolution), which includes SAR analysis for identification and development of drug candidates from their screening database (Figure 2). This label-free affinity binding assay can detect weak protein\u2013ligand interactions and reduce labor and reagent costs by simplifying the initial screening work. However, because of the use of chemical fragments, this technology cannot utilize the tremendous values of existing chemical libraries. There is also no clear answer as to how many fragments screened will be enough, therefore this approach can potentially lose leads because of biased microarrays, created by lacking certain chemical fragments.",

Microarrays containing thousands of compounds or pharmacophores, at the microliter level, can be screened in parallel with multiple biotargets. However, the major disadvantage of this platform is that it requires specific chemistry for coupling, limiting the use of existing chemical libraries. In addition, factors such as the length and flexibility of linkers, compound binding orientation, spatial hindrance and microarray surface properties also affect target binding. Nevertheless, in combination with proteomic and genomic research, lead compounds perturbing a biological signaling pathway can be rapidly identified with this technology 15, 33.",

In this study, a library of \u223c250,000 compounds from different structural classes was screened and novel inhibitors from different classes identified. Using similar approaches, Abbott scientists have applied the \u03bcARCS technology to different enzymes. For example, Gopalakrishnan and co-workers [18] used the same technology to screen for caspase inhibitors. First, 8640 discrete compounds were spotted and dried onto a polystyrene sheet the same size as a conventional microtiter plate. Then, an agarose gel containing caspase-3 was laid on top of the compounds, followed by a second agarose gel with peptide substrate placed on top of the enzyme gel \u2013 starting the reaction. Groebe et al.\n[34] and Freiberg et al.\n[35] have reported other protease- and kinase-based screening approaches \u2013 using radiometric detection methods for kinases (Figure 3). One interesting application of this technology was to use it for identifying agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors [36]. HEK-293 cells coexpressing human dopamine D(4.4) receptor and chimeric G(\u03b1qo5) protein, preloaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester, were cast into a 1% agarose gel, then placed above the compound sheet.

            "text": "Discovery Partners International (DPI) has licensed the \u03bcARCS technology from Abbott for commercialization, and further improved the whole process from microarray spotting and agarose gel casting to imaging and data analysis [37]. At DPI, scientists arrayed a total of 4608 chemical compounds (20 nl), in duplicate on a standard array that had a footprint of a microtiter plate, using the modified Gilson Constellation\u2122 system with syringe-solenoid dispensing technology. With this method, the compounds are dried immediately after spotting and can be stored in a gas-tight inert atmosphere for future assays. Although the platform has been tested for many diversified targets, including enzymes and receptors [37], one of the major problems with this approach is that the rate and capability of resolubilization and diffusion of different classes of dry compounds will complicate the dynamic range of arrayed compounds versus bioavailable compounds. To address this question, Cheng et al.\n[38] have characterized the diffusion of 59 compounds with diverse properties by using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) to determine how much compound was left on the polystyrene sheet after incubation with the agarose gel for defined periods of time. As expected, the study found that compounds of lower ClogP showed a higher rate of transfer to agarose gels, whereas other physical properties, such as molecular weight, size, acidity and H-bonding properties, have less effect on diffusion rate. The study demonstrated that the majority of the 59 compounds had >20% transfer after a 10 min incubation with agarose gels, providing sufficient amounts of compounds for screening purposes. The study also revealed that certain compounds might have transfer problems, thus yielding insufficient concentrations of compound for interaction with biotargets. This is a particular problem for in vitro screening campaigns in which fast enzyme reactions, weak inhibitors, weak receptor binders, hydrophobic compounds and complex natural products might be involved. Differential transfer rates in HTS will detect inhibitors at different kinetic time points, resulting in incomparable inhibition profiles. This would be a major challenge when IC50 profiling a group of compounds against the same target, under the same reaction conditions.",

To perform microarray reactions comparable with reactions done in microtiter plates, solution-phase chemical microarrays have to be developed. One of the first groups to try to combine peptide microarray technologies with conventional liquid handling methods to transfer kinase reactions to microarrays was that of Houseman and colleagues [39]. They first coated glass-surface microarrays with a peptide substrate for kinases, and then prepared a kinase reaction solution, in conventional 384-well plates, that included the chemical compound, the kinase and ATP. The kinase reaction was initiated by transferring the kinase reaction solution from the 384-well plate to the substrate-coated microarrays. This study demonstrated that the phosphorylation reaction, and its inhibition by chemical compounds, could be detected in this array format. However, this approach is not an ideal solution because the procedure requires premixing reagents in wells (on plates) and then transferring them to a substrate chip, which, of course, demands more labor and time in liquid handling than conventional systems.",

To activate this solution-phase chemical microarray they adapted an aerosol deposition technology that converts biological targets into a fine mist, which can cover the top of the whole microarray simultaneously [21]. Exploiting this technology as a new tool for drug screening, Reaction Biology has licensed and developed solution-phase chemical microarray technology into a commercial product, the DiscoveryDot\u2122 chemical microarray drug screening platform (Figure 4\n) 22, 23. DiscoveryDot\u2122 is based on the principle of microarraying chemical libraries on a glass slide (1 inch \u00d7 3 inches) in formats with >6000 compounds per microarray \u2013 in a nonvolatile glycerol-based format compatible with \u221280 \u00b0C storage. Each compound forms an individual well-less reaction center in a total volume of 1 nl. The biochemical reactions are then started by using aerosol deposition technology, and the reaction products are detected with a laser scanner or imager (Figure 4). One of the key elements of DiscoveryDot\u2122 is that the chemical compounds and targets are in solution throughout the whole process; therefore, all existing chemical libraries can be screened by this platform, making this technology the only universal chemical microarray to date. Because this solution-phase platform mimics the conventional large volume well-based system, the environment and mechanism of biochemical reactions on this microarray are very similar to the well-based reactions \u2013 but with higher efficiency for profiling multiple biotargets. For example, we have microarrayed the library of pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC) on polylysine-coated slides, poly-(Glu-Tyr) peptide-coated slides, and dephosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP)-coated slides, in parallel. The polylysine slides were then used for protease screening; the poly-(Glu-Tyr) peptide-coated slides were used for screening against Src, a tyrosine kinase, and the MBP-coated slides were used for screening against p38\u03b1, a serine\u2013threonine protein kinase. Each round of screening for proteases and for Src has yielded many inhibitors (unpublished), but p38\u03b1 screening has only yielded one particularly strong inhibitor, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole (SB202190). When the same reaction was performed in a 384-well plate format the same compound was identified with similar potency [40].",

Because of the nature of homogeneous reaction systems, time-dependent and dose-dependent reactions can also be performed on microarrays, delivering kinetic parameters such as K\nm, V\nmax, and k\ncat. In fact, the authors demonstrated that these microarray-generated parameters were quantitatively similar to those derived from well-based assays. For example, both technologies yielded similar IC50 values for caspase-6 when the same reaction conditions were used. Furthermore, taking advantage of miniaturization pays off in larger scale HTS: the total cost of microarray-based reactions could be reduced over 20-fold compared with standard low volume 384-well-based assays [22].",

For example, Ziauddin and Sabatini [41] have developed a reverse-transfection microarray by using gelatin to immobilize cDNA vectors on regular glass-surface chips (upon which cells can be grown) to study gene function. Using a similar approach, Stockwell and Sabatini's groups [19] have recently published the first chemical microarray format for cell-based high-content screening. In this study, biodegradable polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA\u00ae) copolymer was used to impregnate the microarray surface with 200 \u03bcm diameter discs for each compound, and cells were then seeded on top of these compounds that were slowly diffused out to affect proximal cells. PLGA\u00ae, which has been used for delivering protein drugs, enabled the controlled release of proteins and small molecules through a combination of drug diffusion and polymer erosion. This chemical microarray technology has the potential for high-throughput cell-based assays, but must overcome a few obstacles before becoming useful as a broad platform. For example, finding one polymer for imbedding and releasing possibly millions of chemical compounds (with different physical properties) is a challenge. In addition, the release and stability of chemicals will affect the assays and comparison studies. Furthermore, the authors have noticed that chips printed >72 h before use are not as active as freshly printed chips. Data analysis is another challenge \u2013 because the concentration of compounds in cells decreases from the center of the array to the skirt. As a result, the effects of the compounds are also decreased at the outer edges, increasing the burden of data analysis in addition to the already complex format for microtiter-plate-based screening.",

In addition, the markets for arrayers, assay detectors and data analysis are readily available (Table 1\n). However, for one to take advantage of these chemical microarrays, a correct platform has to be selected. The summary in Table 2\ncan be used as a general guide for biochemical assays. For example, the immobilized microarray platform is preferred for fishing biological targets from a mixture of biofluid. Either dry forms or gel-pad forms can be used for almost all chemical and enzyme reactions, and cell-based assays are possible by using the slow-release property of polymers used for embedding the chemicals; however, the difference in rates of compound dissolution, diffusion and stability makes it difficult to observe uniform reactions. The solution-phase chemical microarray, which mimics the conventional well-based assays, can be used for homogeneous and heterogeneous assays with virtually all chemical compounds, enzymes and protein\u2013protein interactions. However, the assay formats are limited at present by the availability of suitable detectors. This will continue to limit assay choice until detectors are developed with the necessary resolution and sensitivity to recognize the \u03bcm reaction centers.",
