This is especially important for the elderly population and patients who are immunocompromised, and it includes limiting or eliminating contact with all health care facilities as feasible. Outpatient infusion centers are located on hospital campuses or in physicians' offices, where patients coming for infusions could come into contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The risk is higher for those receiving OPAT because they are required to come daily\u2014and in some cases twice daily\u2014leading to repeated exposure. Nursing homes can subject patients to even higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure, with catastrophic results: In some states, almost half of nursing home residents have been infected. In addition, frequent contacts with the health care system will put patients receiving infusion therapy at risk for other nosocomial infections, such as with multidrug-resistant organisms, Clostridium difficile, or other respiratory viruses.",

Transitioning patients receiving OPAT to home would also help conserve personal protective equipment among health care workers, which is critical given the national shortage in supplies.",

There have previously been concerns that expanding coverage for OPAT will lead to increased unnecessary use of intravenous antibiotics. However, this can be overcome by limiting OPAT coverage to the diagnoses that are treated with intravenous antibiotics in standard clinical care, such as endocarditis and osteomyelitis.",

If this were done in conjunction with telehealth, it could lead to protection of both patients and health care providers.
