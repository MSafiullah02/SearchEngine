Russell [1] showed that bacteria were distributed in sediments of the Bay of Naples at depths ranging from 50-1000 m below the surface of the water. ZoBell and Morita [12] , in a study carried out about 25 years ago, showed that bacteria are indeed present in sediment cores taken in the Phillippines and Marianas trenches. Some 25 years earlier, Reuszer [13] had demonstrated that bacteria are much more numerous in bottom deposits than in overlying water, and that the number of bacteria decreases with depth into the sediment. Dale [14] showed a strong relationship between bacterial numbers and sediment properties, i.e., the number of bacteria is highly correlated with grain size and other granulometric properties.",

More recently developed methods include ATP measurement, a biochemical technique for estimating total microbial biomass as a function of the luciferinluciferase reaction, which is quantitatively dependent on the amount of ATP in the sample [19] , and bacterial cell wall component analyses [20] . Several different approaches to microscopic bacterial counts are now available, all employing fluorochromes and epifluorescent microscopy. Some of these methods enumerate total (i.e., living and non-living) bacteria [21] [22] [23] , whereas others purport to count only living bacteria [24] [25] [26] . Recently, Tabor and Neihof [27] compared 2 of the direct viable count methods with amino acid uptake, and found that amino acid uptake consistently measured a larger number of cells. The epifluorescent-immunofluorescent method offers exciting new opportunities for .determining directly the presence of pathogens in water, even when these organisms are viable but non-recoverable [28] [29] .",

More recently, Sieburth [30] surveyed seawater from the Pacific, Caribbean, and Atlantic Oceans, culturing bacteria in agar roll tubes indicated within 4.5\u00b0C of the temperature of the water from which they were obtained. The isolates were keyed to genus, and a characteristic bacterial flora was reported in the 150 ~m-thick surface film overlying 'low-count' waters off the west coast of Central America in an area known for upwelling; in all the samples, pseudomonads were dominant. However, very recently, the same areas have been re-examined and the dominant organisms, especially at the ocean dumping sites, have been identified as Vibrio spp. [31] . Murchelano and Brown [32] found that heterotrophic bacteria in the Long Island Sound water column showed bacterial concentrations ranging from 103-104 per ml, with variations in seasonal concentration mirroring that of the phytoplankton. Gram-negative rods constituted 99% of the isolates. 8 Genera were identified, but 92.3% were A chromobacter, Flaoobacteriurn, and Pseudomonas, with Pseudomonas dominant in the summer and Flaoobacterium in the spring. Again, more recent work suggests a far more prominent role for Vibrio [31] .",

When populations in the settlements along coastal regions of the world were small and sparse, and fishermen harvested offshore, the risk of contamination of fish by domestic and/or industrial wastes was low. Nevertheless, even in the earliest recorded times, disease was widespread and life expectancy short. With the world population increase, and concomitantly more densely inhabited cities, domestic and industrial waste problems have magnified. The spread of disease via fecally contaminated water and foods in many countries is guarded against by hygienic treatment of sewage wastes. Despite such efforts, outbreaks of disease still occur.

For this reason, those concerned with water potability, as well as food safety, including microbiologists, sanitary engineers, and medical personnel, have devised schemes using indicator organisms as a warning of the unsafe condition of waters and foods, the protocol specifying the use to which the water is to be put.

Questions to be answered, with regard to estuarine and marine water standards include: (i) for which activities are water quality standards needed; (ii) are corresponding fresh water indicators adequate and appropriate indicators of health hazards or increased risk of disease arising from the presence of pathogenic organisms of fecal origin; and (iii) are such indicators appropriate and satisfactory, even for fresh water? Of greatest importance is defining what the indicators will be used to indicate, i.e., fecal pollution or risk of disease. In addition to public health problems associated with infectious microorganisms transmitted by water, it has become evident that there are also risks of disease caused by organisms which occur naturally in the aquatic environment. Gastroenteritis or wound infections are caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus and related Vibrio spp., as well as by Pseudomonas and Aeronomas spp., none of which are necessarily associated with fecal pollution. It is increasingly evident that indicators of sanitary quality are not appropriate markers for the presence of pathogens that are autochthonous to the aquatic or marine environment.

A dramatic example is the 1854 cholera epidemic in London. In the late 1880s, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis were isolated from the feces of patients by Von Fritsch. Escherich [48] isolated Bacillus coil, now classified as Escherichia coil, and A erobacter aerogenes ( Enterobacter aerogenes) from feces. These bacteria and other coliforms were used in the past as indicators of water-borne pathogens, that is, the presence of fecal contamination being correlated with the occurrence of pathogens, for which direct detection methods were not available. Thus, 'indicator organisms' are markers of health hazards and/or water (or food) quality. Mossel [49] , when discussing markers in foods, differentiates indicators from index organisms, the latter suggesting the risk of occurrence of pathogens, indicators being more general and suggesting inadequate bacteriological quality. Cabelli [50, 51] also differentiates fecal indicators from water quality indicators. Fecal indicators would be inadequate as markers of pollution by organisms from fecal wastes if these organisms could multiply in the environment. A water quality indicator would be necessary to indicate these organisms, in addition to those organisms which do not have a fecal source, but are health hazards and are present in the environment [50] .",

Since an indicator of fecal pollution is usually considered to be an index of the risk of the presence of fecal pathogens, the indicator must be present when the pathogen is present, and its source should be feces. An indicator must be sufficiently abundant in feces that the probability of detection is high, and it should be present in higher concentration than the pathogens. Also, an indicator should be as resistant, or more resistant, than the most resistant fecal pathogens, and it should not multiply in the aquatic environment, whether freshwater or marine. In addition to these basic requirements, simple techniques must be available for detection and quantification of the indicator. The ideal indicator, therefore, is the pathogen itself [56]. In fact, Salmonella spp. has been suggested as an index of pollution in fresh water [59] . The major arguments against using pathogens directly as indicators have been that they are difficult to isolate and identify, which is in most cases no longer a problem, and that the absence of one pathogen does not rule out the presence of another, nor does it have predictive value for the concentration of the pathogen [58] .

They concluded that the ability of bacteria to grow in EC broth at 44.5\u00b0C was not sufficient proof of a fecal source, and that whether or not K. pneumoniae was correlated with fecal pollution, it was indicative of a potential health hazard. Enterococci have been proposed as indicators of fecal pollution for coastal bathing waters [71] . Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci which grow at temperatures between 10-45\u00b0C, and survive exposure to 60\u00b0C for at least 30 min, grow at pH 9.6 and also grow in 6.5% sodium chloride [72, 73] .

The concentration of E. coil is also used in shellfish guidelines. Although coliforms are used as indicators, their effectiveness is now being questioned for both fresh and salt water applications. One major problem with fecal coliforms is their low survival rate in sea water, compared to other indicators and pathogens. Dilution alone does not account for the rapid decrease in coliform counts near sewage outfalls in marine waters [82] . Various mechanisms have been proposed for the 'die-off, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation [83] , predation [84] , competition [85] , osmotic stress [86] , antibiosis [82] , and heavy metal toxicity [87, 88] . Solar radiation is considered by some investigators to be a significant factor responsible for the bactericidal action of seawater. In field studies, mortality rates of coliform bacteria exposed to seawater are much greater in daylight than in the dark [83, 89, 90] . Gameson and Gould [91] report that half of the lethal effect of light is due to wavelengths below 370 nm, while the remainder results from light wavelengths of 370-400 nm. However, Fujioka et al. [92] stress the effect of visible light as more significant than that of UV light, with respect to the bactericidal action of light on both fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in seawater. High turbidity, which blocks the penetration of sunlight, slows the rate of bacterial mortality [93] . Reduction in coliform counts has been shown to be correlated with intensity of sunlight and has been concluded to be related to diurnal and seasonal variations. These variations should be taken into consideration in designing ocean outfalls and sampling protocols for coastal waters [941.",

Bottom sediments were found to contain larger numbers of E. coli [127] and Enterobacter aerogenes [128] than the overlying seawater, because of a higher concentration of organic matter in sediment. In laboratory studies using autoclaved estuarine sediments and seawater, E. coli has been shown to increase in number [127] , whereas when non-autoclaved sediments and water were employed, persistence of E. coli was noted, with limited growth of the organism. LaLibert~ and Grimes [129] made similar observations on the in situ growth and persistence of E. coli inoculated into dialysis bag-contained sediment. Gerba and McLeod [127] suggest that the type of nutrient and microflora present in sediment may differ from those present in sea water, allowing for greater competition with E. coil in sediment. The particle size of sediment was found to be inversely proportional to the concentration of nutrient, and to survival of Enterobacter aerogenes [128] . Since the survival of fecal coliforms in sediment samples was prolonged at 4\u00b0C, the temperature of sediment in situ is also an important factor in their persistence [130] .",

Methods for recovery of stressed coliforms have been proffered for fresh water [141] and for frozen or heated foods [142] . For stressed coliforms in marine waters, the methods presently available which allow 'repair' include filtration through membrane filters which are subsequently placed on two-layered plates [143] , modification of the most probable number (MPN) method requiring transfer of all presumptive tubes showing growth whether or not gas is produced [140] , use of special membranes that 'nestle' the bacteria [144] , and pour-plating followed by overlaying with a selective medium [145] .

Fecal coliforms and total coliforms have been used as indicators of contamination by domestic sewage, and therefore of the risk associated with exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens. However, in fresh water and waste water effluents [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] , marine waters [133, 152, [155] [156] [157] , and in shellfish meats [152, 158, 159] , the total coliform and fecal coliform counts cannot be used to indicate the presence of enteroviruses. The lack of association of these 69 indicators with enteric viruses is due to the fact that the latter survive longer in the 'recoverable' stage than fecal coliforms in fresh water [148,1.50] and marine water [160] , resulting in continuously changing ratios of viruses to the fecal indicators. However, Goyal et al. [155] observed a positive correlation between the concentration of virus in sediment and total coliform concentration. Although De Flora et al. [134] found significantly larger numbers of viruses and bacteria in surface waters than in bottom water or sediment from polluted coastal waters, they also concluded that sediment was a transient reservoir for viruses and that survival of viruses was longer in some sediments than in sea water. In open ocean water, viruses persist longer when associated with, or attached to, solids, than when not associated with solids [161] . Viruses also survive longer in sediment than in overlying water [134] , resulting in greater concentrations of enteric viruses recorded as being present in sediment than in water samples [132] . Since adsorbed viruses remain infectious [162] , viruses in sediment and resuspended sediment are potential health hazards.",

Total and fecal coliforms are also destroyed by chlorine more quickly than viruses [149] . Cold temperatures and factors associated with gross pollution appear to prolong virus survival in rivers [150] . Since fecal streptococci and enterococci survive longer than fecal cofiforms, in both fresh water and sea water, fecal streptococci and enterococci have been suggested as better indicators of enterovirus contamination in fiver water [150, 160] , relatively less polluted waters [148, 157] , and coastal recreation water [71] . However, the viability in virus titers recorded for sediment and sea water samples is less than that of any of the bacterial indicators examined [134] .",

It is important to point out the disturbing finding of Gerba et al. [156] that enteroviruses can be present about 40% of the time in approved recreational and shellfish harvesting waters, approval being based on total or fecal coliform standards. Although the number of total coliforms was reported to be correlated significantly with the number of viruses present in water samples, the amount of variation associated with the indicator was such that it could not be considered a good predictor. A positive correlation between coliforms and enteric viruses was found for ocean waters, but only for samples collected close to a sewage outfall. At further distances from the outfall, viruses could be isolated, even in the absence of fecal indicator bacteria [157] . Vaughn et al. [152] found little difference in the viral quality of open and closed shellfish waters. Furthermore, echovirus, the vaccine strain of poliovirus, and other, unidentified viruses, could be isolated from clams collected from both areas [152] .",

Enteric viruses have been isolated from shellfish collected from approved shellfishing waters. For example, Fugate et al. [158] reported the isolation of echovirus type 4, and poliovirus types 1 and 3, from oysters collected in approved waters off the Louisiana and Texas Coast. The coliform MPN of water and coliform MPN, E. coli MPN, and aerobic plate count of the oysters, thus, were not indicative of the presence of viruses [158] . No correlation was found between fecal coliforms in water and the number of viruses isolated from oysters collected from approved and prohibited oyster harvesting sites in coastal Mississippi [164, 165] . Rather than using fecal coliforms as indicators, it was proposed that a virus, such as poliovirus type 1, could be helpful, and that concentrations of a viral or bacterial indicator in the sediment might also be valuable as a predictor of health risk from viral contamination. Similarly, Goyal et al. [159] found no significant correlation between virus concentration in oysters harvested from approved shellfish sites and the bacteriological quality of water and shellfish.",

The fact that a small number of viruses constitutes an infective dose has prompted the recommendation of less than one viral infectious unit per 10 gallons (37.8 1) of water as acceptable [166] [167] . Methods for the detection of viruses in water are still being improved, and recoveries are low. Therefore, the detection of one virion indicates the presence of many more viruses which go undetected. Sobsey and Glass [168] have developed filtration methods which have an average recovery efficiency for poliovirus from tap water of 30%, ranging between 17-65%. In a comparison of positively charged microporous filters with conventional standard methods, i.e., negatively charged filters, for the recovery of enteric viruses from tap water, conventional methods averaged less than 5% recovery efficiency, whereas the new methods averaged 64% and 22.5%, for 1-and 2-stage protocols [169] . Sobsey et al. [170] have also devised methods for recovery of viruses from shellfish, with virus recovery efficiencies ave'raging 46%. But, as has been noted, epidemioiogical studies are needed for primary contact and shellfish harvesting waters [44, 50, 156, 171] . To date, the evidence available suggests that the presence of viruses in shellfish can be linked to viral gastroenteritis and hepatitis outbreaks.",

            "text": "Enteric viral disease outbreaks, traced to swimming in polluted waters or eating contamined shellfish, have made it clear that coliform standards are not sufficient for monitoring the health hazards posed by the presence of viruses in sewage or the presence of viral pathogens in freshwater, marine waters, or in shellfish. Viruses which may be transmitted by water, and are currently of interest, include enteroviruses, adenoviruses, reoviruses, hepatitis A virus, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, and the norwalkvirus [50, 172] . Total and fecal coliforms, E. coil, enterococci, fecal streptococci and S. faecalis do not survive as long as the viruses employed in studies accomplished to date, and therefore cannot be relied upon to be present and recoverable when enteric viruses are also present. Coliforms can be a useful indicator for very recent contamination, but clearly not for contamination after a prolonged period of time after occurrence. Fecal streptococci and enterococci, which survive longer in seawater than coliforms, but have not been studied as thoroughly as the coliforms, have been proposed as indicators for the presence of enteric viruses [71, 173] , but, as stated above, cannot be relied upon to indicate the presence of viruses. Viral indicators, suggested for waste-water, include Sabin vaccine poliovirus [164, [174] [175] [176] , cyanophage [177, 178] , and coliphage [179, 180] . The difficulties associated with the use of a virus as an indicator are many, the most important of which are: no single human virus is always present in every sewage-impacted area; viruses are often present only in relatively small numbers; and better methods for virus concentration are badly needed [175] . Total virus count was recommended as a method preferable to enumeration of poliovirus for those countries with high enterovirus infection rates [175] . Katzeneison and Kedmi [181] found that poliovirus was absent in about 50% of waste-water samples tested, although the total virus concentrations were high. They also recommended that a system be developed to isolate and identify total viruses in water. Smedberg and Cannon [177] proposed the use of LPP-cyanophages, i.e., viruses of blue-green algae of the general Lyngbya, Phoridium and Plectonema [182] as indicators of the presence of human enteric viruses and reliability of disinfection for treated wastewater. Cyanophages can be found throughout the year in wastewater. Furthermore, they are more resistant to chlorine than coliforms, and can be correlated with the number of fecal coliforms present in wastewater [177, 178] .",

In similar experiments, polioviruses were isolated from all parts of crabs, being present in highest concentrations in the hemolymph and digestive tract of the animal [193] . Poliovirus survived for up to 6 days in crabs held at 15\u00b0C.

It is now well known that larger concentrations of bacteria are found near the mouths of rivers and bays in highly populated areas and other coastal regions than in the open ocean. To protect bathers from waterborne enteric diseases acquired by swimming in coastal waters, some indication of the extent and amount of fecal pollution is needed. Epidemiological studies are valuable for determining whether or not swimming in sewage-polluted waters poses a health risk, and, also, what organism or organisms are best suited to predict such health hazards. In addition to assessing the risk of enteric viral and bacterial diseases such as infectious hepatitis, typhoid fever, shigellosis, and cholera, the risk of contracting diseases affecting the eyes, ears, nose, throat and skin, as well as wound infections, is a matter of serious concern. Organisms which cause the latter group of diseases are not necessarily sewage-associated, and may not be signalled by the traditional drinking water indicator bacteria [194] . An important aspect of epidemiological studies is the determination of the infectious dose for a particular pathogen, and its virulence.",

Not all of these organisms are necessarily of concern for the marine environment.

However, staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and including S. aureus, have recently been isolated from coastal, offshore, and deep ocean sites [197, 198] .

Indicator organisms used to compare to the incidence of disease in both the American and British studies were total coliforms. However, the authors of these reports reached different conclusions. Stevenson [202] reviewed results of surveys of swimming pools and beaches on the Ohio River, Lake Michigan, and Long Island Sound, and concluded that a positive correlation existed for fresh waters between high total coliform concentrations and illness in swimmers, i.e., more swimmers than non-swimmers became ill, with more than one-half of the illnesses being ear, eye, nose, and throat diseases, one-fifth gastrointestinal, and the remainder skin or other types of infections. On the other hand, Moore [203] , who reported on an epidemiological study of bathing waters carried out on the coasts of England and Wales, found no evidence to support the conclusion that sewage-contaminated water was a significant cause of illness. It should be pointed out, however, that isolation of Salmonella spp. from seawater was interpreted as being evidence of the wide dissemination of this organism in the population at large, rather than a risk of infection for bathers. In a later publication, Moore [196] concluded that the environmental hazards of swimming are difficult to assess and require statistical proof of association, causation, and specificity of disease with cause of the disease. Two other factors important in epidemiological studies were cited, these being the incubation time of the pathogen, and dose response of morbidity related to frequency of swimming [196] .",
