Approximately 20% of solid organ transplantation procedures performed in the United States occur in high-risk serodiscordant pairs.75 For HCT recipients, CMV-seropositive recipients of grafts from seronegative donors have been noted to be at higher risk from CMV disease and death compared with recipients of grafts from seropositive donors, presumably because the latter type of recipient receives CMV-specific donor CD4+ and CD8+ T cells which can help contain infection.76\n77 However, the results of studies of CMV-related outcomes in CMV-mismatched donor\u2013recipient HCT pairs are inconsistent.78 Other risk factors for CMV infection in HCT recipients include umbilical cord blood transplantation, receipt of T cell-depleted stem cells, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), total body irradiation, and fludarabine-containing chemotherapy regimens.79 CMV-seronegative transplant recipients receiving allografts from seronegative donors are at the lowest risk for CMV disease after transplantation and they should receive leukoreduced and/or CMV-seronegative blood products.27\n80\n",

            "text": "The standard of care for treatment of CMV infection and disease is intravenous (IV) ganciclovir or its oral prodrug, valganciclovir.27 The mechanism of action for ganciclovir and valganciclovir, like that of the other drugs approved for CMV treatment, foscarnet and cidofovir, is through inhibition of viral DNA polymerase activity.89 Treatment dosing for IV ganciclovir is 5 mg/kg twice daily with a duration of 2 to 4 weeks, but longer therapy may be required, depending on the decline in viremia and resolution of symptoms.90 Valganciclovir is dosed 900 mg orally twice daily and both ganciclovir and valganciclovir should be dose-adjusted for renal impairment. The equivalence of IV ganciclovir and oral valganciclovir for the treatment of mild-to-moderate CMV infection and disease in SOT recipients has been demonstrated in a multicenter, randomized trial comparing the two therapies in 321 SOT recipients.90 Valganciclovir demonstrated a rate of viral clearance at 21 days similar to that of IV ganciclovir with comparable side effects. Also, there were no differences in long-term outcomes at 1 year of follow-up.91 Of note, patients were excluded if they had a life-threatening CMV disease and median initial viral loads were relatively low, < 20,000 copies/mL. In this study, most patients in each arm of the trial were viremic for longer than 21 days, demonstrating that treatment of CMV infection may need to be prolonged. Treatment should last at least 2 weeks and continue until viremia has resolved.27\n80 Low pretreatment CMV viral loads have been correlated with more rapid disease resolution with antiviral treatment.55 Intravenous ganciclovir is recommended over valganciclovir for patients with impaired GI absorption, those with questionable compliance, or those with life-threatening disease.27\n80 Oral ganciclovir can prevent CMV disease, but neither it nor acyclovir is recommended for the treatment of CMV.27\n80 Because of their toxicities, particularly nephrotoxicity, foscarnet and cidofovir are reserved for failure or intolerance of ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Reduction of immunosuppression should be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe CMV disease.27\n80\n",

Universal prophylaxis has the advantage of protecting against other herpesviruses, and it has been associated with a decreased risk for opportunistic processes such as PTLD, infection by Pneumocystis jiroveci, aspergillosis, and bacterial infections in SOT recipients.10\n49\n119\n120 Preemptive therapy avoids the use of potentially toxic and costly medications, and may also allow exposure to CMV so that immunity develops and limits the later development of CMV disease.27\n80\n114 However, preemptive therapy is logistically difficult and the monitoring expensive, and this approach may not detect CMV infection before the onset of disease, particularly in CMV D + /R\u2212 SOT recipients. Most SOT programs internationally and in the United States favor universal prophylaxis70\n100 although studies vary in outcome differences between the two options. Two meta-analyses have shown reduced CMV disease and allograft rejection with both strategies,4\n116 with universal prophylaxis associated with fewer opportunistic infections and lower mortality in one study4 but similar mortality in the other.116 A more recent meta-analysis of 20 studies involving 2,744 SOT recipients showed a similar risk of CMV syndrome with the two approaches, but a higher risk of late-onset CMV for prophylaxis compared with preemptive therapy and no difference in graft loss, acute rejection, other opportunistic infections, or mortality.121 The Swiss Transplant Cohort Study of over 1,200 SOT recipients demonstrated similar rates of CMV disease with prophylaxis and preemptive strategies but improved graft survival with prophylaxis.122 The available randomized trials that compare universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy have also shown similar efficacy for CMV disease prevention,36\n123\n124\n125 but improved allograft survival with universal prophylaxis in some studies.36\n124 Antiviral resistance has been encountered with each strategy.27\n95\n126\n127\n128 Current CMV guidelines for SOT recipients recommend universal prophylaxis for D + /R\u2212 SOT recipients and either prophylaxis or preemptive therapy for R+ recipients.27\n80 CMV D \u2212 /R\u2212 SOT recipients do not require CMV prophylaxis.27\n80 Among HCT recipients, valganciclovir was not proven superior in preventing CMV disease, other infectious complications or death when compared with preemptive therapy in a randomized, double-blind trial, and more patients receiving valganciclovir required hematopoietic growth factors.129\n",

A randomized trial of brincidofovir versus placebo in allogeneic HCT recipients has shown efficacy of brincidofovir in preventing CMV viremia and disease when dosed only twice weekly.137 The results of a recently completed multicenter phase 3 trial in HCT recipients examining the efficacy of brincidofovir for CMV prevention have yet to be published.a\n",

Although supportive data are limited, a hybrid approach to prophylaxis is an option, particularly for patients at high risk of late CMV disease or those on augmented immunosuppression.80\n139 This approach involves a period of prophylactic antiviral therapy followed by a period of monitoring for CMV viremia. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of monitoring for CMV infection after prophylaxis discontinuation, and its specificity in predicting disease are low.140\n141\n",

            "text": "Given EBV's widespread prevalence and potentially devastating consequences in immunocompromised hosts, it is an important consideration in transplant medicine. After primary infection occurs, EBV establishes lifelong latency primarily in B lymphocytes (memory B cells), and to a lesser extent in T lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells.150\n158 The virus is shed in the saliva, hence its spread through close oral contact. EBV may replicate in squamous epithelial cells but not in the absence of B lymphocytes.150 EBV also has the ability to transform B lymphocytes, and is associated with lymphomas, including Burkitt, Hodgkin, and immunoblastic lymphomas, as well as nonlymphoid malignancies including nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinomas.150\n159\n160\n161\n162 Among SOT and HCT recipients, PTLD is the most concerning EBV manifestation as it may lead to high-grade monoclonal lymphoma.158 EBV can exploit normal B lymphocyte biology through complex immunomodulatory effects of EBV proteins, leading to the malignant proliferation of cells. For example, Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen-1 protein binds to viral DNA, allowing the EBV genome to be maintained in the B cell, and additional EBV proteins can function as oncogenes, blocking differentiation and facilitating lymphocyte proliferation.150\n159\n163 The importance of viral and cellular micro-RNAs in promoting EBV oncogenesis has also been recently noted.159\n164 The immune response to EBV infection is mediated by NK cells and cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes.150\n165 With anti-T cell immunosuppression after transplant, EBV-infected B lymphocytes can proliferate with impunity. The polyclonal proliferation may transform to monoclonal proliferation that develops into a lymphoma.150\n159\n166 In SOT recipients, the source of the EBV is usually reactivation from the recipient,167\n168\n169 although PTLD that occurs early posttransplant is more likely to be of donor origin.170 In HCT, the source of EBV is usually from the donor.171\n172 Among SOT recipients, the highest rate of PTLD is in the first year after transplant, although more recent data suggest that this rate may be decreasing and that the onset of PTLD is getting later post-SOT.158\n173\n174 Recent data among HCT recipients show a median time to development of PTLD ranging from 2 to 6 months post-HCT.171\n174\n175\n",

QNAT is often used to quantify EBV viral loads in the blood and assist in diagnosing EBV infection and PTLD, although the variation in QNAT assays used by different centers and lack of a universally recognized cutoff to assess the clinical significance can make test results difficult to interpret.179 EBV QNAT assays are sensitive for detecting infection, but have limited specificity in terms of predicting PTLD.187 In addition, as mentioned above, not all PTLD is EBV-related.

The most common radiographic findings reported with HSV pneumonia include bilateral symmetric ground glass attenuation, although consolidation has also been described.236 Disseminated HSV infection with involvement of noncontiguous visceral organs is associated with very high mortality, especially with HSV hepatitis.237 HSV hepatitis commonly presents with fever, transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and abdominal pain.237 HSV viremia is associated with visceral involvement and increased mortality. Among a series of intensive care unit patients, HSV viremia had a high incidence of pneumonia (38%), hepatitis (15%), and death within 20 days (27%).238\n",

Asymptomatic HSV-1 viral shedding in the lower respiratory tract is relatively common, especially in critically ill and immunocompromised patients.241 It is suggested that a higher HSV viral load in BAL fluid is associated with a worse outcome and with pneumonitis,241 but a causative association has not been proven.233 Bronchoscopy does allow direct observation for signs of tracheobronchitis, but bronchoscopic examination can also be normal.233 Overall, HSV is considered to be an uncommon cause of pneumonia, even in immunocompromised patients. In one series of 63 immunocompromised patients diagnosed with pneumonia, HSV was determined to be the leading cause in 2 patients (3%).242\n",

            "text": "In 1988, Yamanishi et al implicated HHV-6 as the cause of roseola (exanthema subitum) or sixth disease in children.305 In 1989, HHV-6 was isolated from PBMCs from 100% (26/26) of infants with roseola during the first 3 days of fever; the rate of viral isolation fell to 17% by day 5 to 7 and 0 by day 8.306 Subsequent studies demonstrated that primary infection with HHV-6 was a common cause of acute febrile illness (with or without skin rash) in infants and young children.307\n308\n309\n310 In a prospective study of 243 acutely ill children < 2 years old who presented to an emergency department (ED), HHV-6 viremia was detected in 34 (14%).310 Symptoms of HHV-6 infection included: malaise (82%); fever > 40\u00b0C (65%); inflamed tympanic membranes (62%); nasal congestion (57%); rash (18%); seizure (3%). The typical rash of roseola was present in only three children. Only 2 were hospitalized and all 34 recovered, usually after an average of 4 days of fever.310 In 1994, Hall et al studied 1,653 infants and young children (< age 3 years) who presented to an ED with acute febrile illnesses.309 Overall, 160 (9.7%) had a primary HHV-6 infection, as documented by viremia and seroconversion; 21 (13%) were hospitalized and 21 (13%) had seizures.309 Often the seizures appeared late and were prolonged or recurrent. Conversely, no primary HHV-6 infections were found among 582 infants and young children with acute nonfebrile illnesses or among 352 controls without acute illness.309 In another cohort of 81 children < 2 years old with primary HHV-6 infections, the following symptoms were present: fever (57%); fussiness (69%); rhinorrhea (65%); diarrhea (26%); rash (31%); roseola (23%); and seizures (0%).297 A study in the United States followed 227 children born to HIV-seropositive mothers.311 The cumulative infection rates of HHV-6 DNAemia at 6 and 12 months of age were 28 and 78% in HIV-negative children compared with 11 and 33%, respectively, among HIV-infected children (p < 0.001).311 There was an association between high CD4 counts and HHV-6 infection, consistent with the tropism of this virus for CD4 lymphocytes. Among HIV-infected children, HHV-6 infection was associated with progression of HIV disease (p < 0.05).311 HHV-6 is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa in healthy young children.302\n312 In a study of 371 asymptomatic infants in Zambia, serum HHV-6 DNAemia was present in 15% at 6 months and 19% by 18 months.302 Two studies from Zambia detected HHV-6 DNA in the blood of 5 to 30% of HIV-negative children admitted to the hospital with febrile illnesses.302\n313 A prospective study of 303 pediatric inpatients aged between 3 weeks and 2 years in Zambia detected HHV-6 DNAemia in 20.8%.312 Data regarding the importance of HHV-6 as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or acute respiratory infections in children are scant, as this pathogen is rarely looked for. However, in a study from rural China, Zhou et al obtained induced sputum from 354 hospitalized infants and children with acute respiratory infections (273 had CAP; 81, non-CAP).308 HHV-6 was detected in 50.9% of children with CAP and 42% among 81 with non-CAP. These various studies suggest that HHV-6 is a common cause of acute febrile illness with or without rash in children, and the course is usually benign and self-limited over several days.294 Pneumonia and seizures can occur, but are uncommon in immunocompetent hosts.",

In a series of 30 lung or heart-lung transplant recipients, serial clinical specimens (blood, BAL fluid, tissue) were tested for HHV-6 PCR; HHV-6 was detected in 20 (66%) at a median of 18 days posttransplant.337 Although no clinical disease was linked to HHV-6 infection, mortality was higher in HHV-6-infected patients (7/20 expired) compared with uninfected patients (0/10 expired). Additionally, eight of nine viral or fungal infections were associated with HHV-6. Another series of 26 lung transplant recipients detected no cases of HHV-6 infections in peripheral blood.357 Costa et al examined 87 transbronchial biopsies from 30 lung transplant recipients by QNAT; HHV-6 DNA was detected in 6.9%, but did not correlate with allograft rejection and the clinical significance was not clear.358 In another series, 22 lung or heart-lung transplant recipients were followed for 1 year posttransplant; HHV-6 antigenemia was detected in 20 (91%) in blood or BAL.359 Only two had clinically significant disease (pneumonitis in one; encephalitis in one).359 Neurohr et al followed 87 consecutive lung transplant recipients for a mean of 3.3 years; HHV-6 was detected in 20 (23%) and was associated with an increased risk of BOS.338 However, in a subsequent study, Manuel et al followed 93 lung transplant recipients for 3 years, and measured HHV-6 PCR in all BAL specimens.339 HHV-6 was detected in 20.4% of patients, but was not associated with acute lung allograft rejection or BOS. In summary, HHV-6 is isolated in blood or BAL in > 20% of lung transplant recipients but the clinical significance remains unclear.
