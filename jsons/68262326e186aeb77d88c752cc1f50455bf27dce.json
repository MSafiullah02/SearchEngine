Upon post-mortem examination, V. vulnificus was isolated, identified, and named as BJ-PH01. Further analysis showed that BJ-PH01 belongs to biotype 1 and the Clinical genotype. Furthermore, we performed an epidemiological investigation of V. vulnificus in six aquariums in northern China. As a result, V. vulnificus was successfully isolated from all investigated aquariums. The positive rates ranged from 20% to 100% in each investigated aquarium. During the investigation, 12 strains of V. vulnificus were isolated, and all 12 isolates were classified into biotype 1. Eleven of the 12 isolates belonged to the Clinical genotype, and one isolate belonged to the Environmental genotype. All 12 isolated V. vulnificus strains showed limited antibiotic resistance. Overall, our work demonstrated that V. vulnificus is frequently distributed in aquariums, thus constituting a threat to captive marine mammals and to public health.",

            "text": "1 | A spotted seal died due to V. vulnificus infection Since March 2016, a captive spotted seal (Phoca largha) had suffered from a traumatic injury on the tail, which had not healed over a 2month treatment. The mental condition and health status were not clearly affected during the course of treatment. In May 2016, the seal began vomiting, became depressed, and died within 24 hr of the onset of clinical manifestations. Upon necropsy, severe pneumonia (Figure 1a), extensive intestinal hemorrhage (Figure 1b), and liver necrosis (Figure 1c) were observed. No lesions were noted on the heart, kidney, stomach, or spleen. We preliminarily speculated that the seal had died due to sepsis induced by trauma fester or other lethal infections. To explore the cause of death, we conducted bacteriological analysis (Figure 2a) and virological testing. Consequently, we failed to detect any known viral pathogens from the dead seal. In addition, V. vulnificus was successfully isolated from the fester, blood, and several tissue samples (i.e., lung, liver, intestine, and spleen) (Figure 2b). The result was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing, V. vulnificus vvhA (cytolysin/hemolysin) gene-specific PCR amplification (Figure 2c), the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System, and electron scanning microscope (SEM) analysis (Figure 2d). The isolated V. vulnificus was named BJ-PH01. These results suggested that the seal died due to septicemia induced by",

Scientific research on marine mammal infectious diseases has been relatively insufficient. Previously demonstrated pathogens of marine mammals include viruses (e.g., adenovirus, calicivirus, herpesvirus, morbillivirus, poxvirus, influenza virus, retrovirus)(Goldstein et al., 2009;Maness et al., 2011;Ohishi et al., 2010;Ramis, van Riel, van de Bildt, Osterhaus, & Kuiken, 2012;Rivera, Nollens, Venn-Watson, Gulland, & Wellehan, 2010), bacteria (e.g., Actinomycetes, Brucella, Clostridia, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Pasteurella multocida, and Mycoplasma)(Waltzek, Cort\u00e9s-Hinojosa, Wellehan, & Gray, 2012), and parasites (e.g., Acanthocephalans, Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis, Coccidia, and Parafilaroides decorus)(Hernandez-Orts et al., 2015;Jensen, Aars, Lydersen, Kovacs, & \u00c5sbakk, 2010). Here, we demonstrated that spotted seals can be infected by V. vulnificus. As no host tropism of V. vulnificus has been reported, one can speculate that other marine mammals might also be infected with V. vulnificus. Therefore, we should pay more attention to abnormal deaths of wild marine mammals to accumulate scientific data.In addition to V. vulnificus, other opportunistic pathogens of the Vibrio genus were also detected in this investigation, such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio fluvialis. Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a marine organism native to estuarine waters around the world. In Asia, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a common cause of foodborne disease(Sakata, Yonekita, & Kawatsu, 2018), while Vibrio alginolyticus is implicated in wound infections and otitis. Vibrio alginolyticus was recently recognized as a human pathogen after excessive exposure to seawater",
