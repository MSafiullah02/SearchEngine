Recently, there has been a radical movement in the clinical microbiology laboratory to provide expeditious results. One of the most noteworthy developments was the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), which has successfully replaced traditional biochemical identification methods at many institutions [1]. Other identification-focused approaches are multiplexed PCR [2] and microarray-based technologies [3]. Technological advancements have focused primarily on rapid identification of microorganisms directly from clinical specimens, including syndromic panels that are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic detection of a variety of organisms within 1 to 3 hours. These rapid identification tests have been remarkable in significantly shortening time to identification and, in some cases, antimicrobial optimization.",

When choosing an empiric antimicrobial regimen, the clinician must weigh the risk of poor patient outcome from potentially under-treating a drug-resistant pathogen against the societal importance of antimicrobial stewardship [9]. Complicating this are patient-specific factors, including medication allergies, renal or hepatic disease, and drug interactions (Table 1\n). Formulary restrictions add another layer of intricacy to the situation. While it is difficult to choose the best empiric agent, clinicians depend on the results from the microbiology laboratory to select the most appropriate, targeted therapy. Traditionally, this has been dependent on culture and susceptibility results, although that paradigm may be shifting.",

Clinicians may not always appreciate that the MIC does not necessarily reflect efficacy; rather, it is simply a laboratory value reflecting a relationship between drug concentration and organism killing. Determining whether a given medication can be used for a particular microbe or infection type requires knowledge of the medication's pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters [10]. PK describes the interaction between the drug and the host: absorption, distribution, and elimination. PD details the effect of the drug on the organism. The combination of PK/PD parameters, along with the MIC and several other factors, such as clinical outcome data and MICs for isolates with known mechanisms of resistance, leads to the creation of clinical breakpoints and guides the clinical laboratory's reporting strategies for susceptibility.",

Sometimes, an \u201cintermediate\u201d result is reported, which generally indicates that the MIC or zone diameter may be more difficult to overcome than for \u201csusceptible\u201d isolates, but clinical efficacy might still be achieved, depending on the dosage or site of infection. Adding to the complexity is the more recent category of \u201csusceptible-dose dependent,\u201d used when there is evidence that a more aggressive dosing regimen can be used to treat an infection with an MIC above susceptible but below resistant. This is different from intermediate. Occasionally, a report of \u201cnonsusceptible\u201d may be seen. In this case, only a breakpoint for susceptible exists because resistance is exceedingly rare. Nonsusceptible does not mean that the isolate has a resistance mechanism. Instead, it indicates that there is only evidence to support a definition for susceptibility. Finally, there are some drugs (i.e., colistin) that only have epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs), defined as the upper limit of susceptibility for the wild-type population of isolates. It is important to emphasize that ECVs are not clinical breakpoints and are provided for informational purposes only [11].",

Disk diffusion depends upon the ability of antibiotic molecules to diffuse out from a disk into the agar, forming a circular zone. The zone diameter is measured after 18 to 24 hours of incubation and compared to standardized charts, allowing qualitative susceptibility interpretations [10, 12]. In addition to disk diffusion, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recognizes two other reference standard AST methods: broth microdilution and agar dilution [13]. These two methods offer MIC results alongside clinical breakpoint interpretation. In contrast, a limitation of the disk diffusion method is the absence of an MIC result, and only the breakpoint interpretation is reported to clinicians.",

An organism is then dissolved into solution and inoculated on the plate. The plate with the lowest drug concentration at which there is no growth is determined to represent the MIC. Similarly cumbersome, the preparation of reference broth microdilution is rarely offered outside of reference or research laboratories. Therefore, MICs are generally obtained via automated systems such as Microscan Walkaway, BD Phoenix, Vitek 2, or Sensititre ARIS 2X [14]. Each system has strengths and limitations, but all are unified in the low requirement for hands-on time; use of intrinsic interpretation rules that are built into the software; and the ability to provide quantitative MIC values, albeit only in doubling concentrations (e.g., 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc). Additionally, gradient diffusion (i.e., Etest and Liofilchem) combines the methodology of disc diffusion with the quantitative MIC results. This method utilizes an antibiotic-impregnated strip with decreasing gradients. The shape of the zone of inhibition is elliptical; the MIC is the point at which the tips of the ellipse touch the strip.",

On the other hand, early detection of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus species by detection of vanA or vanB ensures escalation of antimicrobial therapy if the patient is on vancomycin empiric therapy. Several studies have supported positive patient outcomes when rapid genotypic susceptibility results were available within hours of blood culture positivity [18, 19]. In one, there was a decrease in the treatment of coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia and a more rapid change to appropriate therapy for VRE bacteremia [20].

Unfortunately, additional phenotypic susceptibility testing using commercial systems may also interpret these isolates as falsely susceptible [25]. In an attempt to avoid potential false negatives caused by mecC-harboring MRSA, the Xpert MRSA Gen 3 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), was recently FDA cleared as a molecular test to screen for MRSA using both mecA and mecC [26].

The mecA and vanA vanB genes have high predictive value for S. aureus susceptibility to oxacillin and/or cefoxitin and enterococcal susceptibility to vancomycin, respectively [2, 27]. Discrepancies between molecular and phenotypic results may be seen. The CLSI provides a guide to assist laboratorians in investigating these situations, which includes recommendations for reporting when there is discordance between molecular and phenotypic assays for S. aureus (oxacillin), Enterococcus spp. (vancomycin), and Enterobacteriaceae (extended-spectrum beta-lactams).

This panel offers detection of 14 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as two yeast targets, by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the generation of MIC values using a morphokinetic cellular analysis of individual immobilized bacterial cells every 10 minutes in the presence or absence of antimicrobial agents. For each drug-specific test, a single concentration of antibiotic is used to provide MICs and categorical interpretations of susceptible, intermediate, or resistant in approximately 7 hours. This represents an innovative first step in the quest for rapid phenotypic susceptibility tests. The clinical trial was conducted across 13 U.S. institutions on 872 prospective clinical samples and 1,068 seeded samples [31]. The essential agreement (EA) and categorical agreement (CA) ranged from 94.3% to 97.9%, with \u22641.0 major error (ME) or very major error (VME). Similarly, a single-center U.S. study of 232 positive blood cultures reported an EA and CA of 95%, with 1 VME and 3 MEs. The investigators reported a substantial decrease in time to susceptibility results of almost 42 hours compared to standard-of-care testing, with a reduction in hands-on time of about 30 minutes [32]. The test does not eliminate the need to subculture positive blood cultures to ensure detection of other organisms not included in the panel. However, in the majority of cases, the PhenoTest BC can function as a standalone test in the sense that subsequent AST from culture is not required.",

Numerous studies have also reported high agreement compared to conventional AST using such approaches as generating a bacterial cell pellet to test on commercial automated AST systems [34, 35]. Unfortunately, these approaches are not widespread in clinical laboratories for reasons including limited resources and expertise, regulatory concerns over using laboratory-developed tests, and a low sense of urgency due to the perception that patients are on appropriate empiric therapy. Therefore, in order to ensure widespread dissemination in clinical laboratories, development of direct-from-specimen AST systems at a reasonable/low cost needs to be a priority. For instance, a recent proof-of-concept study from the CLSI AST Subcommittee ad hoc working group on direct AST from blood cultures was conducted with the goal to develop and standardize a direct from blood culture AST that can be performed in all laboratories.

The initial panel will offer testing on Gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures using a customized Sensititre plate that allows MIC determination and breakpoint interpretation in approximately 3 hours. Since there is no identification feature, a drawback is that the system is reliant on the adoption of a rapid identification test in the clinical laboratory to maximize the utility of the test. Another upcoming assay is the Smarticle (Roche, Pleasanton, CA), which uses recombinant bacteriophages with DNA probes that bind to specific bacterial targets to deliver a custom-designed DNA molecule that causes viable bacteria to express luciferase. For example, the absence of luciferase expression in a sample mixed with a defined concentration of antibiotic would be interpreted as susceptible. There are no publications on the two systems to date.",

The system utilizes forward laser light-scattering technology to rapidly screen urine for the presence of bacteria at a limit of detection of 103 CFU/ml. The technology has been proven to perform AST directly from urine samples with promising results [43, 44]. An innovative approach from Accelerate Diagnostics is the development of a lower respiratory tract panel on the Pheno System (described above). This will offer both identification and phenotypic AST, a feature that continues to be unique among the FDA-cleared systems, including the lower respiratory tract panels that will be offered by BioFire Diagnostics and Curetis. A potential downside of these methods, however, is increased cost compared to traditional susceptibility testing methods.",
