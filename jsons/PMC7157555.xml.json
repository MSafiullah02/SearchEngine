            "text": "Since late 2010, emerging highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strains have resulted in severe economic losses in several counties in North America and Asia [1,2]. PEDV strains cause porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and dehydration in seronegative pigs at all ages, with high mortality in suckling pigs [3]. Many attempts have been made to develop a safe and protective vaccine for controlling PED [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. However, similar to studies on most enterotropic and mucosal transmissible viral diseases [11,12,13,14], using intramuscular (IM) administration of inactive or subunit vaccines combined with commercial adjuvants, such as multiple emulsions of water/oil/water or a B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) induced production of systemic IgG and neutralizing antibodies but failed to elicit a mucosal IgA response and efficient protection [6,7,15,16,17]. Furthermore, poor efficacies of currently commercialized vaccines have been reported [18,19,20]. Since parenteral administration of vaccines is the most convenient method of vaccine application in the swine industry, strategies like improving delivery techniques [21,22] or the use of molecular adjuvants could be employed to modulate mucosal immunity [23,24].",

On the other hand, the CCL25/TECK expressed by mucosal epithelial cells can chemo-attract CCR9+ cells and support CCR9 expression leukocytes to migrate to the small intestine [30,31]. The application of CCL27 and CCL25 as an adjuvant in DNA vaccines was proven to enhance systemic and/or mucosal immune responses following IM injection in mice or macaques [32,33]. Therefore, the incorporation of these CC chemokines as immune trafficking signals could be a potential strategy for the development of effective parenteral PEDV vaccine regimens.",

As compared with the mock group, the iPEDV group elicited systemic PEDV-specific IgG (Figure 4) and VN antibody titers (Figure 5) but failed to elicit a detectable PEDV-specific fecal IgA response (Figure 4). Interestingly, pigs of all chemokine-adjuvanted groups not only induced superior PEDV-specific IgG levels (Figure 4) and viral neutralizing (VN) antibody titers (Figure 5) as compared to those of mock and iPEDV groups, but also induced variable and detectable levels of PEDV-specific fecal IgA (Figure 4). Statistically significant higher levels of PEDV-specific IgA were detected in the iPEDV+CCL28 and iPEDV+CCL25/27/28 groups as compared to the mock group at 28 days post-immunization (DPI) (Figure 4).",

The clinical signs, fecal conditions, daily viral shedding, weekly body weights, and VN antibody titers were evaluated. During the study, no statistically significant difference in weekly body weights was observed among different groups (data not shown). Regarding the fecal conditions, no clinical signs were observed in the pigs before the PEDV challenge. After oral inoculation with PEDVPT-P6 and 7, all pigs in the mock and iPEDV group showed typical PEDV-associated diarrhea, in which moderate to severe watery stools (score 2\u20133) were noted in 4 out of 5 and 3 out of 4 pigs at 3\u201317 and 6\u201313 days post-challenge (DPC), respectively (Figure 6A,B).

In pigs immunized with iPEDV adjuvanted with both CCL25 and CCL28, only intermittent loose diarrhea (score 1) was detected in 2 out of 5 pigs during the PEDV challenge (Figure 6D).

In the present study, we have demonstrated that IM co-administration of iPEDV with CC chemokines as adjuvants could induce superior systemic antigen-specific IgG, mucosal antigen-specific IgA, and recruitment of CCR9+ and/or CCR10+ inflammatory cells at the injection site of the experimental pigs as compared to control piglets. Strikingly, pigs intramuscularly immunized with iPEDV in combination with chemokines CCL25 and CCL28 were almost fully protected from the virulent PEDV challenge. Taken together, our results suggest that the application of porcine CC chemokines as the iPEDV IM vaccine adjuvants could successfully augment vaccine immune responses at the mucosal sites.",

Both CCL27 and CCL28 have been demonstrated as being able to recruit CLA- positive cells expressing the cognate receptor CCR10 and its ligands in the chemo-trafficking of antigen-specific IgA secreting plasmablasts and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes to mucosal sites of pathogenic exposure [25,28,38,39,40]. These functions had been applied in the development of vaccines for HIV-1 DNA and virus-like particles (VLP). In the HIV-1 DNA vaccine, IM co-administration of HIV antigens adjuvanted with CCL27 plasmid in both mice and macaques has been demonstrated to successfully magnify the HIV-specific IgA titers at mucosal areas [32]. In the case of HIV-1 VLPs co-immunized with CCL28 plasmid, HIV-specific IgA, as well as gastro-intestinal mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells were significantly augmented in mice [41]. On the other hand, co-administration of CCL25 plasmid with the HIV DNA vaccine showed the elevation of both systemic HIV-specific IgG and mucosal HIV-specific IgA immune responses in mice following IM immunization [33].",

Differing from previous studies in using plasmid of CC chemokines as mucosal adjuvants in DNA vaccines [32,33,43], purified mammalian cells-derived porcine chemokines were used instead in the present study. While the level of protein expression and immunogenicity of chemokine plasmids might be variable in different individuals, mammalian cell-derived porcine chemokines proteins used in the present study could provide a standardized and quantitative examination. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the porcine chemokine proteins can be IM co-administrated and capable of modulating mucosal immunity in pigs. As compared to pigs vaccinated with iPEDV in combination with CCL25/27 and CCL25/28, pigs vaccinated with iPEDV in combination with CCL28 alone or CCL25, CCL27, and CCL28 showed minimal protection against the virulent PEDV challenge. Concerning in vivo functions of CC chemokines, the findings unveiled that the iPEDV + CCL25/28 group also showed superior in vivo chemotaxis of CCR9+ cells compared to the iPEDV + CCL25/27/28 group. These results may help to explain that the co-existence of CCL25 and CCR9+ cells attracting chemokines is necessary for the IM iPEDV vaccine to mount effective immune protection against PEDV. Furthermore, the less effective CCL25, CCL27, and CCL28 triple-adjuvanted iPEDV vaccine, which contained 20 \u03bcg of each chemokine per shot, suggested that the amount of each chemokine should be at least 30 \u03bcg per shot to reach similar efficacy of disease protection, such as in the CCL25/CCL28 or CCL25/CCL27 double-adjuvanted groups.",

Co-administration of both CCL25 and CCL28, or both CCL25 and CCL27 has been demonstrated not only to recruit and home CCR9+ and CCR10+ cells to mucosal sites, but also enhance mucosal antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and the secretion of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 [32,33,41,44,45,46,47,48]. It has also been shown that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and interferons (IFNs) might be critical interfering factors against PEDV [18,37,47,48] besides the antigen-specific IgA. Further investigations for disclosing the exact immune-protective mechanism of CC chemokines-adjuvanted iPEDV vaccines, such as functional assays for determining antibody secreting cells, chemotaxis studies for attracting CCR-expressing cells, and ELISpots for studying the PEDV specific cellular responses in the mucosal site, are necessary.",

This novel invention and combination allows us to develop an IM iPEDV vaccine capable of eliciting PEDV-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses, relieving clinical signs, and reducing viral shedding. Moreover, our porcine CC chemokines might be applied to the development of other porcine vaccines against mucosal transmissible pathogens, such as the porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Future research should concentrate on whether co-immunization with CC chemokines and iPEDV provides lactogenic immunity and similar protective efficacy for suckling piglets against PEDV.",
