The most frequent viral causes of LRTIs, especially in children under 2 years, are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus [4]. RSV is the most common viral agent in childhood LRTIs [5]. There is no proven treatment option other than adequate hydration and oxygenation for RSV infections [6]. Therefore, protection from RSV infections is crucial. In recent years, efforts to develop vaccines against RSV infections have gained momentum. Vaccine development efforts focus on early childhood vaccination or protection of babies by antibodies that are transplacentally transported to babies from immunized mothers. While vaccine development studies are ongoing, it is important to understand RSV immunity to determine RSV Ig G antibody seropositivity rates in mother-infant pairs and to evaluate the transplacental antibody transfer kinetics.",

It has been reported that transfer rate of all IgG subtypes was negatively affected in premature AGA infants and term SGA infants. In contrast, Addy et al.

The conflicting results found in the studies may be related to underlying conditions of the inappropriate birth weights for gestational age. The inappropriate birth weight for gestational age can be caused by many conditions associated with the fetus, placenta, or mother, such as hypertension, diabetes, and various placental pathologies. In order to be able to make more accurate statements about this subject, prospective studies are needed by evaluating the conditions causing inappropriate birth weights for gestational age.",
