PEDV has been recognized in veterinary medicine since the early 1970s in Europe and subsequently identified in many other swine-breeding regions of the world [3] . PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality in nursing piglets [4] . PED outbreaks have been reported in many swine-raising countries, including Europe and Asia [5] [6] [7] . With the widespread use of inactivated or attenuated bivalent vaccines for PEDV in China, the nationwide spread of PED was controlled until 2010; however, since December 2010, there has been a remarkable increase (> 50%) in PED observed on many pig farms in China [8] . A high morbidity rate of between 90% and 100% among neonatal piglets was observed, with a mortality rate of 70%-100% on affected pig farms, resulting in a huge economic loss in the pig farming industry [9, 10] . In 2013, PED emerged in swine in the USA [11] and spread rapidly across the country, resulting in the substantial economic losses.

Wang et al. reported that out of 145 archived tissue samples collected from diseased pigs with diarrhea, PMWS, reproductive disorders, respiratory disorders, and PDNS for the detection of PCV3, the PCV3 DNA detection rate was 60.87% (28/46), 20% (12/60), 10% (2/20), 0% (0/16), and 66.67% (2/3), respectively [30] . Moreover, the results showed that the PCV3 detection rate in diarrhea samples was higher than that in the other sample types. Another study analyzed 35 diarrheal weaned pig samples and 35 nondiarrheal weaned pig samples for the presence of PCV3, and found that the rate of PCV3 positivity in the diarrheal samples was 17.14% (6/35), significantly higher than that of the non-diarrhea samples (2.86%, 1/ 35) [31] . These findings suggest that PCV3 may have a potential association with diarrhea. According to these findings, it is likely that a single PCV3 infection or PEDV and PCV3 co-infection could cause diarrhea in pig populations; however, the virus has not been isolated from these populations and studies investigating pathogenesis using the isolated virus have not been conducted. Thus, a rapid and reliable diagnostic assay is required for the simultaneous detection of PEDV and PCV3 in clinical samples for epidemiological and clinical studies, as well as the development of effective control strategies for PEDV and PCV3 infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 114, "end": 117, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 460, "end": 464, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 465, "end": 468, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 469, "end": 472, "text": "44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 473, "end": 476, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 896, "end": 900, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1314, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To date, several approaches have been developed for the laboratory diagnosis of PEDV, including immunohistochemistry [46] , enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [47] , RT-PCR [48] , reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) [49] , a nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay [50, 51] , and real-time RT-PCR [35, 36] . Similarly, immunohistochemical detection, PCR, and qPCR have all been developed for the detection of PCV3 [20, 33, 34, 37] . However, ELISAs and immunohistochemistry are time-consuming techniques with a relatively low specificity and sensitivity. Thus, they cannot be used to estimate the amount of viral DNA/cDNA copies, which can be an important factor for viral diagnosis via correlations with viremia or clinical signs. On the other hand, qPCR has been widely used as a diagnostic method for its apparent advantages over conventional PCR due to its high sensitivity and specificity, allowing for highthroughput screening and the quantification of viral loads using small volumes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a SYBR Green I-based duplex qPCR assay for the simultaneous detection of PEDV and PCV3.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 121, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 165, "end": 169, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 179, "end": 183, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 257, "end": 261, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 298, "end": 302, "text": "[50,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 303, "end": 306, "text": "51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 330, "end": 334, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 335, "end": 338, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 447, "end": 451, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 452, "end": 455, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 456, "end": 459, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 460, "end": 463, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies reported amplicons can be distinguished by the Tm of PCR products from melt curves, which is determined by the reduction in relative fluorescence as all dsDNA are denatured to their singlestranded form, and the shape and peak location of the melt curve are functions of the GC/AT ratio, length, and sequence of the fragment [52, 53] . In this study, the 163-bp PEDV ORF1 gene or 136-bp PCV3 rep gene was successfully amplified using the single qPCR assay with PEDVor PCV3-specific primers. Furthermore, the duplex qPCR assay with two sets of PEDV-and PCV3-specific primers simultaneously detected PEDV and PCV3 DNA in a single reaction tube, with similar sensitivity to the corresponding single qPCR assay (Fig. 2) . The LOD of the duplex qPCR assay was 34.6 copies/\u03bcL for PEDV, which is comparable to those of previously reported qPCR assays [35, 54] . The LOD of the duplex qPCR assay was 61.2 copies/\u03bcL for PCV3, which is a little higher than that of previously reported Taqman-based qPCR assays [37, 55] .

In this study, the total DNA and RNA were extracted from clinical samples using a commercially available kit (Beijing Zoman Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). For a sample infected with DNA virus and RNA virus, the conventional nucleic acid extraction method is usually to extract separately, which is time-consuming. In this method, virus genome DNA/RNA nucleic acid extraction kit can be used to extract virus DNA and RNA from samples at the same time, and save time on the basis of cost saving. However, the efficiency of this kit extract RNA and DNA simultaneously may slightly affect the sensitivity of the assay. The nucleic acid content is a little lower than that of separate extraction, but it does not affect the amplification. In this study, we found the sensitivity of PCV3 amplification increased by approximately 1-3 Cq value, whereas the sensitivity of PEDV amplification was not different compared with conventional fluorescence quantitative PCR. Chumakov studies suggest that in the reverse transcriptase stage, reverse transcriptase can lead to the production of primer dimers, which may be the result of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity [56] . The reason may be that DNA nucleic acid participates in the first 45\u00b0C 5 min reaction in one-step duplex reaction procedure, which reduces the activity of some DNA. However, the positive rate can be determined by melting peak. Although there was no dimer in two-step RT-PCR, the two-step method must be avoided in clinical virus detection, because it not only increases the workload and prolongs the detection time, but also greatly increases the probability of cross-contamination. Anyhow, the establishment of this method can provide a reference for the establishment of multiple DNA and RNA methods for other pathogens. Among 66 intestinal tissue and fecal samples, the detection rates of PEDV and PCV3 using duplex qPCR were higher than those of conventional PCR (Table 2) , and all samples positive for PEDV or PCV3 in the conventional PCR assay were also positive in the qPCR assay. In contrast, some samples that were negative for PEDV or PCV3 using the conventional PCR assay were found to be positive with the qPCR assay. Furthermore, these samples that were positive for PEDV or PCV3 in the qPCR assay but negative in the conventional PCR assay were confirmed to be positive by DNA sequencing. These results suggest that the conventional PCR assay does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect PEDV or PCV3 in samples with low viral loads, whereas the duplex qPCR assay is better suited to detect low levels of virus and perform a quantitative analysis of the viral load. In addition, the detection rates using duplex qPCR were 71.21% (47/66) for PEDV, which is in accordance with previous studies that reported detection rates of 61.10%-78.49% in China [8] . In this study, the PEDV primers target a 163bp sequence in ORF1. Since coronaviruses generate a set of subgenomic RNAs (coding structural and accessory genes) during the replication in the cells, the sensitivity of this assay may be lower than assays targeting other viral genes, such as M and N protein. However, in this study the positivity of PEDV was confirmed in clinical samples using a published method (by Zhou et al.) , and the detection rate for PEDV was similar to that of Zhou's PEDV qPCR method. The result suggested that compared with M or N genes, primers designed in ORF1 region may affect the sensitivity of the test, but PEDV primers designed in highly conservative region will not have a significant impact on the positive rate of clinical samples. Moreover, the detection rate for PCV3 using duplex qPCR was 43.94% (29/66), lower than that reported in diarrheal samples by Wang et al. [30] , but higher than that reported in diarrheal weaned pigs by Zhai et al. [31] . This further supports the high sensitivity and specificity of duplex qPCR, and its applicability for the differential diagnosis of PEDV and PCV3 in field samples. This showed that the newly developed duplex qPCR assay for clinical diagnosis has a significant advantage, as PEDV and PCV3 can be amplified simultaneously in a single reaction mixture. Again, it is efficient, simple, quick to detect PEDV and PCV3 nucleic acid, and reduces the cost of diagnosis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1240, "end": 1244, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2912, "end": 2915, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3332, "end": 3344, "text": "Zhou et al.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3823, "end": 3827, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3900, "end": 3904, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2014, "end": 2023, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The method has high application value.
