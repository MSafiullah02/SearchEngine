            "text": "Mink circovirus (MiCV) is a newly discovered virus originally reported in 26 six- to ten-month-old minks with diarrhea from three farms in Dalian, China [1]. MiCV is a member of Circovirus belonging to the Circoviridae family. MiCVs are single-stranded circular DNA viruses with a genome of 1753 nucleotides, which contain two major open reading frames (ORF). One is ORF1, which encodes a replicase-associated protein (rep) required for viral replication. The other is ORF2, which encodes proteins that form the viral capsid (cap) and participate in host immune responses. Circoviruses have been identified in numerous species associated with various clinical disorders [2, 3], including asymptomatic infections and lethal diseases [4, 5]. Circovirus infections are also related to lymphoid depletion and immunosuppression, which likely increase the severity of secondary infection [6].",
