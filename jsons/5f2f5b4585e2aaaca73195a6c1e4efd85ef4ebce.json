The discrepancy in IC50 was remarkable with nafamostat mesylate; the IC50 decreased by ~ 6,000 fold when the drug was used in the SARS-CoV-2infected Calu-3 cells perhaps due to the dominant role of TMPRSS2-dependent viral entry in the Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells (10)(11). In addition, the IC50 of nafamostat mesylate was exceptionally low (0.0022 \u00b5M), which indicates that nafamostat mesylate is ~ 600-fold more potent than remdesivir in Calu-3 cells. It became more apparent that blood clotting is one of the complicating manifestations in patients with COVID-19 (12)(13), and nafamostat mesylate may play dual roles not only as an antiviral to block viral entry but also as an anticoagulant to remove blood clots frequently associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

Importantly, nafamostat mesylate has been approved for human use in Japan and Korea for over a decade, thus it can be readily repurposed for COVID-19 following phase II-III clinical trials. Currently, a few clinical trials has been registered (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). According to our results, although in vivo animal models are preferred experimental systems for evaluating antiviral efficacy, in vitro testing using human lung cells is a viable option in addition to the commonly used Vero or VeroE6 cells for assessment of antiviral efficacy when the animal models are not readily available.",
