As the disease grew further, Ivorra et al. [2] suggested a \u03b8 -SEIHRD model that took into account various special features of the disease. It also included asymptomatic cases into account (around 51%) in order to forecast the total cases in China (around 168500). Giordano et al. [3] also suggested an extended SIR model called SIDHARTHE model for cases in Italy which was more customized for Covid-19 in order to effectively model the course of the pandemic to help plan a better control strategy. Apart from the epidemiological models, various timeseries models were also suggested in order to model the cases and predict future cases. Ceylan [4] suggested the use of Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to develop and predict the epidemiological trend of Covid-19 for better allocation of resources and proper containment of the virus in Italy, Spain and France. Chintalapudi et al. [5] suggested its use for predicting the number of cases and deaths post 60-days lockdown in Italy. Petropoulos and Makridakis [6] suggested the use of exponential smoothing method to model the trend of the virus, globally. Kumar et al.

A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25 th to April 14 th , which was later extended to May 3 rd . The whole country was divided into containment zones (where large number of cases were observed from a relatively smaller region), red zones (districts where risk of transmission was high and had higher doubling rates), green zones (districts with no confirmed case from last 21 days) and orange zones (which didn't fall into the above three zones). After the further extension of the lockdown till May 17 th , various economic activities were allowed to start (with high surveillance) in areas of less transmission. Further, the lockdown is now extended to May 31 st and some more economic activities have been allowed as per the transmission rates, which are the rates at which infectious cases cause new cases in the population, i.e. the rate of spread of the disease.",

Various mathematical and statistical methods have been used for predicting the possible spread of Covid-19. The classical SIR model by Ranjan [7] , SEIR model by Ranjan [8] and SIQR model by Tiwari [9] suggested the increasing trend of the virus and predicted the peaks of the pandemic. Early researches showed the pandemic to reach its peak by mid-May. They also showed that the basic reproduction number R 0 and the doubling rates are lower in India, with comparison to European nations and USA. A tree-based model was proposed by M.K. & Bhatnagar [10] and Bhatnagar [11] in order to study and predict the trends. They suggest that lockdown and socialdistancing in India has played a significant role to control the infection rates. Kumar et al. [12] suggested the use of ARIMA and Richard models for the same and have used them to predict the cases and deaths in future days. Chatterjee et al. [13] suggests growth of the pandemic through power law and its saturation at the later stages. Due to the complexities in the epidemic models of Covid-19, various researchers have been focusing on the data in order to forecast the future cases. Chatterjee et al. [13, 14] and Ziff & Ziff [15] suggest that after exponential growth, the total count follows a power regime of t 3 , t 2 , t and t 0.5 before flattening out, where t refers to time. It can therefore be realized that there is an urgent need to model and forecast the growth of Covid-19 in India as the virus is in the growing stage here.",

The greatest number of cases per million have been seen in the national capital of Delhi (532.65 cases per million). (Refer [20] for population estimates). Various states such as Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and Manipur have been declared Covid-19 free states as they have treated all their cases since more than 14 days. States of Nagaland and Sikkim and Union Territories of Lakshwadeep Islands and Daman and Diu are yet to report a single case. These large variations suggest the effectiveness of lockdown and sealing of state borders in containing the virus. In the latest research. Singh & Jadaun [25] studied the significance of lockdown in India and suggested that the new Covid-19 cases would stop by the end of August in India with around 350,000 total cases. While some states may see an early stopping of new cases such as Telangana (mid-June), Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal (July-end) etc., the badly affected states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat will achieve this by August-end.",

An ARIMA model can be understood by outlining each of its components as follows: Autoregression (AR) refers to a model that shows a changing variable that regresses on its own lagged, or prior values. Integrated (I) represents the differencing of raw observations to allow for the time series to become stationary, i.e., data values are replaced by the difference between the data values and the previous values. Moving average (MA) incorporates the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. Here, we may refer the reader to follow Box et al. [18] and Box et al. [19] for more details on ARIMA model, estimation and its application ARIMA is a joint model of two models, autoregressive AR p and moving average MA q and is integrated using the difference variable, d.

Estimates of the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing and exponential smoothing models are given in Table 10 . According to the MAPE and accuracy measures, the ARIMA (2,2,0) is a better model than the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing and exponential smoothing models. From this, we can conclude that the ARIMA model is the best fit for the cases of Covid-19, followed by Holt-Winters model. The Forecasting are shown in Table 12 and Figure 3 . We observe that the ARIMA model captures the trend well but it underestimates the actual covid-19 cases. We therefore suggest to update the ARIMA model in future or to use some generalized versions of the ARIMA models in future studies. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Therefore, covid-19 pandemic in India has entered in stage S3 of linear growth. In the days to come, it is highly likely that the total cases may start to follow a square root equation, i.e. In time series analysis, we conclude that the ARIMA (2, 2, 0) is the best fitting model for the cases of Covid-19 with an accuracy of 96.13%. This is also suggested by the Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters models. The basic exponential smoothing is not very accurate for our case but we see that the Holt-Winters model is around 96.073% accurate. Both ARIMA (2, 2, 0) and Holt-Winters models suggest a rise in the number of cases in the coming days. We also observed that the ARIMA model underestimates the actual observations. Therefore we suggest updating the ARIMA model time to time or using some generalized ARIMA models.",
