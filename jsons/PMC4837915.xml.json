In these studies, we found that prophylaxis with hmAb m336 resulted in significant reduction of viral RNA titers and virus-related pathology in the lungs of rabbits. Although low amounts of viral RNA were detected in some m336-treated rabbits (Figure 1A), almost no viral antigen was identified by IHC analysis, indicating that infection of the lower respiratory tract was prevented. Intravenous administration of m336 resulted in neutralizing antibody titers in the serum for several days (Supplementary Table 1), but intranasal administration of antibody did not result in detectable titers. This implies that the topically administered antibody remained in the respiratory tract and could account for the greater efficacy of the antibody administered intranasally versus intravenously [14].",

We observed somewhat more severe lung inflammation than previously reported [7], likely due to differences in route or volume of virus administration. Inflammation was present in more areas of the lung when antibody was administered intranasally as compared to intravenously, although the severity was comparable (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). This could be the result of the additional volume delivered intranasally to achieve a dose of 10 mg/kg of m336. However, since 1 mg/kg treatment was as effective, large inoculum volumes should not be required in future studies.",

It is possible that the high viral inoculum infected susceptible cells in the respiratory tract before m336 administration and that the hmAb could not prevent replication of virus in already infected cells. Alternatively, because qRT-PCR measures both viable and nonviable viral particles, this measurement may not be an accurate reflection of infectious virus. Recent data with other mAbs support the notion that the fold-reduction in titer of infectious virus with antibody treatment is greater than the reduction in viral RNA levels [8]. Therefore, the evaluation of its potential for therapy requires further studies of its effect on infectious virus.",
