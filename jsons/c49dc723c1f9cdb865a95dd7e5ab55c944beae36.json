            "text": "Treatment of local (regional) disease The cornerstone of management of local or locoregional disease is surgery because it can be curative. The extent of resection is dictated by the stage of the disease. T1a tumours can be managed with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), provided the lesion is <2 cm, localized to the mucosa and free of ulceration. Since lymphatic spread almost never occurs in these tumours EMR can be curative [5] . The Japanese have expanded the scope of endoscopic treatment to <3 cm in size and extending into the submucosa (T1b) by doing a submucosal resection. Even in this group lymph node metastasis is low [6] . T1 tumours larger than those mentioned above are treated with gastrectomy with resection of perigastric nodes only (D1 resection). For stages IB to III, patients need radical gastrectomy. If a proximal margin of 5 cm can be obtained then subtotal gastrectomy can be done otherwise a total gastrectomy is recommended. Radical gastrectomy should also include both D1 (perigastric) and D2 (along left gastric, common hepatic, splenic and coeliac trunk) lymph nodes [7] . At least 15 lymph nodes need to be removed for proper staging. In randomized trials, the western literature does not show any survival benefit of D2 gastrectomy over D1 gastrectomy [8] . However, in a 15 year follow-up in one Dutch study, lower recurrence and death rates have been reported [9] . This is associated with a higher mortality and morbidity. A meta-analysis from China did not show any survival benefit of D2 resection [10] . Nonetheless, current practice guidelines indicate D2 gastrectomy as the standard of care.",

Rinke et al. did a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study in unresectable, well differentiated (G1) tumours with a proliferation index Ki-67 <2%. Somatostatin was chosen because it binds to somatostatin receptors thereby inhibiting release of hormones [4] . It also has cytotoxic effects [5] . Rinke et al. [3] included 81 midgut NETs, randomized to long-acting release (LAR) octreotide or placebo. They observed longer progression-free survival with octreotide LAR (14.3 months versus 6 months with placebo). It soon got accepted as a standard therapy for unresectable small bowel NET by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [6] . Other authors have also reported the antitumour effects of SSAs. Caplin et al. [7] reported its efficacy in non-functioning G1/G2 gastroentero-pancreatic (GEP) NETs in which they compared lanreotide analogue with a placebo. The PEP was progression-free survival (PFS). After 24 months of treatment, PFS was 62% in the treatment arm against 22% in the control arm. In yet another study pasireotide LAR was used in GEP NETs (110 patients of which 84 had small bowel NET). In this study instead of PFS, control of symptoms was the PEP. PFS was the secondary end point. The study was prematurely terminated because PEP was not achieved but it showed a significant difference in PFS (11.8 versus 6.8 months) [8] . Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor has also been used in a double blind controlled study where both arms received octreotide LAR [9] . mTOR inhibitor, everolimus in 10 mg daily doses was used and 30 mg intramuscular injection of octreotide LAR was used once in 28 days. A total of 429 patients with NET from various organs were included of which 224 were small bowel NETs. There was discordance in PFS in the study and hence the results are being re-evaluated.",

In a Cochrane review of 48 randomized controlled trials 5-ASA has been evaluated against placebo and sulphasalazine. The multimatrix system form of 5-ASA has been shown to be the most effective for clinical remission [1] . The drug should be tried for at least a month. Usually it is given in divided doses (500 mg 6 hourly). Clinical improvement of ulcerative colitis with 5-ASA occurs in a dose dependent manner. For complete endoscopic remission the dose often requires to be 3 g per day. Failure to improve (both clinical and endoscopic) does happen with 5-ASA. There is no relation to the frequency of administration of the drug (once, twice or thrice daily). In moderately severe disease higher doses (4 g/ day) have been shown to be more effective. In mild disease a higher dose is not associated with better results [2] . Previously treated (with a variety of drugs including 5-ASA, corticosteroids or rectal mesalamine) moderate disease tends to fare better with higher doses of 5-ASA [3] . Simultaneous oral and rectal 5-ASA used for 4-8 weeks has been shown to lead to better remission rates (64%) than with 8 weeks of immunotherapy and oral mesalamine (43%) [4] . 5-ASA is a safe and well tolerated drug. However, abdominal pain, upper respiratory infection (including pharyngitis), anorexia, flatulence or dizziness can occur [1] . 5-ASA is costlier than sulphasalazine and hence the latter is recommended for induction treatment. It is changed to 5-ASA only if the patient is intolerant to it. Moreover for maintenance too sulphasalazine should be preferred over 5-ASA because of its superiority [5] . A word of caution while using sulphasalazine-it may affect male fertility [5] . Lastly, for longer remission 5-ASA has to be used in higher doses (2.4 g/day) than 1.2 g daily [6] .",

The dose is 1.5-2.5 mg/kg body weight per day and it is given for 6 months. During this period corticosteroids are either reduced or discontinued.

A sustained 3 year remission has also been reported particularly when the drug was introduced early (within 3 years of onset of the disease) [12] . The efficacy of the drug for maintenance has been confirmed in a recent Cochrane review [13] but it has to be given for at least one year. Unfortunately, it does have toxicity, notably bone marrow suppression (4%) and acute pancreatitis (2%) [13] . In addition, the incidence of lymphoma on prolonged use of azathioprine is nearly 4 times that in the normal population [14] . The use of thiopurine, which is also recommended for steroid dependent ulcerative colitis, also leads to a similar high risk that decreases with cessation of its use.",

If the response is good patients can be given a maintenance infusion every 8 weeks [16] . A Cochrane review has shown that infliximab can be effective in achieving both clinical and endoscopic response at 8 weeks in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who are refractory to conventional drugs including steroids and azathioprine [17] . Infliximab can be associated with infections requiring antibiotics, development of antibodies to it, reactivation of tuberculosis and fatal histoplasmosis of the lung. Patients younger than 35 years of age also have a risk of hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma generally when infliximab is used with 6-mercaptopurine [18] .",

Moreover, as we started understanding human faecal microbiota more, a pathological relationship between these and certain systemic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, autoimmune diseases, etc. is emerging which are being treated with faecal transplantation. The distinct advantage of FMT is that it can provide the full array of normal gut organisms from a healthy donor unlike treatment by manipulation of colonic bacteria with pre and probiotics. Its efficacy has been shown in an experimental study by Lawley et al. [5] . They induced Clostridium difficile infection in mice treated with clindamycin. When the disease was established (ongoing infection, lasting dysbiosis and reduced gastrointestinal microbial diversity [GIMb])-faecal microbiota collected from the faeces of healthy mice was infused into the colon. With this, Clostridium difficile infection was arrested and the animal became healthy. It is apparent from the study that antibiotic use (or abuse) causes damage to GIMb. This allows invasion by pathogenic organisms (e.g. C. difficile) due to reduced colonization resistance. Once normal microbiota is restored (as with faecal transplantation) GIMb recovers and so does colonization resistance.",

It has a potential pathogenic effect. In the normal colon it cannot differentiate and produce its characteristic toxin. However, if the colonization resistance decreases due to any cause (antibiotics, operation, chemotherapy, etc.), it provides an opportunity for these organisms to produce epithelial damage leading to diarrhoea. Once clostridial colitis is diagnosed, metronidazole and vancomycin are used with success. However, nearly one-quarter of patients develop recurrent disease. The management of this group is difficult and hence FMT has been advised. Success has been reported in 94% of patients [6] and is far superior to the results of probiotic therapy. This proves that healthy donor faeces contain a higher combination of colonic bacterial strains. In addition, probably the presence of bile acids, various proteins and bacteriophages in donor faeces make FMT more effective. There is only one randomized study on FMT versus standard vancomycin therapy. The result of FMT was so overwhelmingly superior that the study was prematurely terminated. In the study group in this series Clostridium difficile infection resolved in 94% of patients versus 23%-31% in the vancomycin treatment group [7] .",

Three months later, no active inflammation of the colon was seen and the patient remained asymptomatic. Borody et al. have reported that this form of treatment gives complete clinical, endoscopic and pathological evidence of remission [11] . Recently a review of the use of FMT for the treatment of ulcerative colitis [12] reported 91.9% overall response with 67.7% complete response. Over 50% of patients undergoing repeat colonoscopy at a mean follow up of 33 months, did not show any mucosal lesion; neither was there any histopathological evidence of disease. Unlike in other diseases, in ulcerative colitis FMT needs to be repeated. The schedule followed is-initially FMT is done colonoscopically, followed by daily enemas for two weeks, this is followed by every alternate day and then twice a week and lastly once a week. The duration of treatment is decided by the clinical response and repeat colonoscopy at 12 weeks. Many patients may need FMT for weeks. It is exceptional for patients to experience cure with one or two FMT enemas. It is suitable even for children with ulcerative colitis [13] .

As a result of this, mixed venous blood is rapidly shunted into the pulmonary vein and gross ventilation-perfusion mismatch occurs resulting in hypoxaemia. This defective gas exchange worsens in decompensated cirrhosis wherein alveolar-capillary diffusion impairment occurs leading to a decrease in total oxygenation of the blood. The vasodilatation occurs because of nitric oxide (NO) production both by eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) from pulmonary vascular endothelial cells and by iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) of macrophages [4] . Some newer insights into the mechanism of pulmonary vascular bed dilatation come from the common bile duct ligation (CBDL) model in experimental animals. Such animals have proliferating cholangiocytes in the liver that produce and secrete endothelin 1 (ET-1). After CBDL, the animal develops cirrhosis and a hyperdynamic circulation. This leads to increased stress in the pulmonary vascular bed. There is expression of endothelin B receptors in the pulmonary vasculature. The increased plasma levels of ET-1 and over expression of endothelin B receptors stimulates production of nitric oxide via eNOS [5] .",

Monocytes have been shown to increase in the pulmonary vascular system in CBDL rats. These cells increase NO level (through stimulation of iNOS) and CO (through heme oxygenase-1) resulting in vasodilatation. Endothelins seem to have a role in this because they help monocyte adherence in the pulmonary vascular bed by production of monocyte chemokine, fractalkine (FKN) which causes angiogenesis both directly and through VEGF production by monocyte related action [6] . The anti-VEGF action of sorafenib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) reduces monocyte adhesion in the pulmonary vascular bed and has been shown to improve oxygenation in the CBDL model [7] .

Over expression of annexin A1 and inhibition of annexin A2 improves oxygenation in the CBDL model [8, 9] . Translocation of bacteria and endotoxaemia has also been hypothesized to be involved in HPS. A glucose-regulated 78 KDa protein, a marker of TNF-alpha and endotoxin has been shown to be increased in the lungs. This protein decreased following treatment with levofloxacin.

Liver transplantation: This is the only viable option to satisfactorily improve oxygenation in patients with HPS. The problem is the availability of a cadaveric donor. Since these patients have good liver function they are unlikely to get a liver too soon.

It has been reported that, with such an exception, patients live longer in the pre-transplant period than those without HPS.

To move forward, GWAS have opened the area of genetic treatment of PBC by adopting measures directed against IL-12/23. The environmental factors implicated in the pathogenesis of PBC include chemicals, bacteria and substances foreign to the body (xenobiotics). All these can cause alteration of native mitochondrial protein of the host AMA. This process can initiate an immune response in the host and the original protein becomes an autoantigen [12] . This is considered a key factor in the pathogenesis of PBC.",

Fatigue is a disturbing symptom with a poor quality of life. In a prospective study reduced survival was seen in patients of PBC with fatigue [13] . Liver transplantation can improve fatigue but after 2 years the fatigue returns [14] . Pruritus in PBC is caused by stimulation of itch-related nerve endings by pruritogens such as histamine, serotonin and gastrin releasing peptide receptors [15] . Previously cutaneous bile acids were thought to be responsible for pruritus because bile acid binding agents led to improvement. However, there is no direct relation between skin or serum bile acids and pruritus. It is possible bile acids may act through stimulation of other itch neurotransmitters such as autotoxin [16] . ",

However, both National Cancer Database (NCDB) and SEER support extended cholecystectomy for T1b gall bladder cancer. Further, a multicentre study has evaluated 115 cases of re-resection (after initial cholecystectomy) for gall bladder cancer. Residual disease was reported in 46% of cases.

Often, the pathology report of the cholecystectomy specimen showing malignancy comes as a surprise. What to do in such situations, in the absence of any guideline, is difficult to decide. Should all such patients be reoperated? In an old but significant study [6] it was observed that reresection (extended cholecystectomy) for T1a did not have any benefit. However, patients with T1b lesions had a significant benefit. In this latter group tumour recurrence was significantly lower than in those with T1b tumours not undergoing reoperation. Hence the decision to reoperate largely depends on the depth of tumour infiltration into the gall bladder wall. Tumours infiltrating into the muscular layer (T1b) should have reoperation and a formal extended cholecystectomy done.",

Pancreatic enzyme supplement and antioxidants are also used. In early stage of the disease, pain may be managed with analgesics but as the severity increases, patients more frequently require opioids. Addiction to opioids is a genuine problem because of severity of pain with resulting depression. Adjuvant treatment with opiod therapy is often used. Pregabalin has been shown to have a modest effect in one randomized study [19] . Tricyclin antidepressants and serotonin inhibitors have also been used [20] . Pain which does not improve with the above may benefit from endoscopic treatment for stone and stricture of the pancreatic duct. Alternatively, surgical management can be undertaken which has shown better and sustained result (i.e. pain relief). Various endoscopic treatments have already been discussed in another section of this volume. Various surgical approaches are lateral pancreatojejunostomy or head coring/excision operations (Frey or Begger or Berne). Both forms of surgical treatment have their supporters with equal results [21, 22] . All patients after surgery should receive pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Total pancreatectomy is seldom done in current surgical practice. However, it may have to be considered for patients who fail to respond to both surgical and non-surgical therapies and are troubled with severe pain and complete exocrine and endocrine insufficiencies. It is also done for prophylaxis against development of pancreatic cancer in hereditary or familial pancreatitis [23] . Total pancreatectomy and islet cell transplantation are increasingly being done in selected centres. With this, pain severity is reduced, as is the insulin requirement. In fact, 46% of patients at 5 years and 10% at 8 years following this surgery are free of insulin [24] . It is not clear when surgery should be done. Opinions vary: one group feels it should be done early before opioid dependence develops. To answer the question of timing a Dutch study is in progress which may enlighten us on this issue [25] .",

To improve upon this, multiple plastic stents have been placed for 1 year with planned stent changes every 3 months. Success with this strategy has been 92% in the long-term [12] and this has been recommended by the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [1] . Fully covered self-expanding metal stenting has been tried as an alternative to the above, but the success rate is not very high. In addition, both proximal and distal migration, and cholangitis have been frequently observed with this stent. Stent removal is also difficult in this group. Stent blockage due to tissue overgrowth is another problem encountered with its use. For blocked stents, another stent has been placed through the previous one with some success [13] .",

In terms of number this figure may not look large but the malignancy rate is 35 times higher than in individuals who do not have a cyst [2] . Nearly 74% of these malignancies are detected at the initial imaging. It is estimated that the real prevalence of malignant cysts in the American population is 33/100,000 [3] . On a follow up study from Korea, 1.3% malignancy has been reported [4] . Clearly, the previous notion that pancreatic cysts are non-malignant is not true. Certain cysts however have a greater propensity for malignancy than others. Mucinous and serous cysts are contrasting examples. While the former has a higher rate of malignancy the latter has a very low rate. Cysts of the pancreas can be classified into: Of these, mucinous neoplasms have a high malignant potential including SPEN. Serous cystadenomas very rarely turn malignant.",

Accuracy of CT in the detection of mucinous cyst is 70%-80%, but it can accurately detect various subtypes in fewer cases [5] . Detection of mucinous cyst is more accurate with MRI (79%-82%). MRI has additional benefits in that it can identify septae, nodules and ductal communication without the risk of radiation. Use of gadolinium has not been found useful in one study and has been recommended to be used in select cases where MRI without gadolinium is inconclusive in characterizing the cystic lesions [6] . Utility of EUS in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts has been evaluated by Khasab et al. [1] . They compared CT, MRI and EUS in 154 patients. Accuracy of EUS was 76% (with or without cytology, CEA and amylase estimation) as compared to 48% for CT and 34% for MRI. But EUS alone has not been found good enough in differenting various neoplastic and non-neoplastic cysts (56% sensitivity, 45% specificity and 51% accuracy) as reported by Brugg et al. [8] . When FNA, fluid biochemistry and cytology were added with EUS, the accuracy increases. Lee et al. have published results of cyst fluid analysis [9] . They showed CEA less than 5 ng/mL in serous cyst adenoma, pseudocyst and neuroendocrine tumour with 54% sensitivity and 94% specificity. CEA higher than 192 ng/mL was seen in mucinous cyst (73% sensitivity and 84% specificity). Amylase level less than 250 units/L ruled out pseudocyst (sensitivity 44% and specificity 98%). Mutation analysis for K-ras was not very sensitive but was highly specific for detection of mucinous malignant lesion. Translational research has identified several markers that can be used in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts. One such marker is guanidine nucleotide alpha stimulating binding protein (GNAS). It is expressed in excised specimens of IPMN or in the cyst fluid of IPMN. Of all the genes studied in this tumour, GNAS positivity (mutation) was 79%, K-ras 50%, 3% each of tumour protein \u00fe53 and V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) [10] . Micro RNAs are also used in the diagnosis of cystic lesions of pancreas. In a study evaluating 378 mRNAs, four mRNAs were found useful in differentiating serous cystadenomas from IPMN and mucinous neoplasms from branched duct IPMN with 85%-100% sensitivity and 100% specificity [11] . Better sensitivity has also been observed with proteomic study in the fluid aspirated during EUS. Mucin analysis through proteomics has been reported with accuracy rate of 98% as compared to 78% for CEA estimation and 71% for cytology [12] . Tissue metabolites from pancreatic cysts (excised specimens) -glucose and kynurenine were also identified. These two metabolic products are reported to be low in mucinous than in non-mucinous cysts [13] .",

Having discussed various developments recently reported, one has to come to the reality on the ground. The issue is -what will happen to the cyst? Both patients and their care givers like to know. The answer is difficult because we still do not know much about the natural history of these cysts. Ascertaining the diagnosis preoperatively is difficult and often not possible. In addition, features of malignancy are uncertain (often having false positivity and negativity). Given this background it stands to logic to excise all such lesions but that is both impractical and not desired for a fair number of cystic pancreatic lesions.

This is time for us to learn the lessons and practise pancreatic surgery more judiciously [7] . As regards vascular resection to achieve R0 status-the problem is somewhat unclear. Multiple studies have shown more complication rate in this setting [8, 9] . I strongly feel, these can be better managed with neoadjuvant treatment often avoiding the need for a vascular resection. Even if it is to be done-it should be done in a high volume centre by a surgeon who is experienced enough to tackle this issue. 5. Stratification of IPMN into branch duct and main duct types is increasingly felt important from the management standpoint. While the main duct type is more frequently malignant or has a higher malignant potential, the branch duct type has very little malignant potential. Thus while main duct type should always be resected, the branch type can be kept under follow up (see the other chapter on this elsewhere in this volume). The problem is how to differentiate these? Image analysis (CT, MRI) is often inaccurate (incorrect diagnosis in 25%-30% of IPMNs [10] ). This leads to improper management. Therefore CT/MRI alone cannot be relied on too heavily; instead other biological markers such as genetic, proteomic and metabolomic characteristics that are being developed should also be used. 6. Like IPMN, neuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas are also increasingly encountered in contemporary surgical practice. Biological behaviour of these tumours is not yet clear. Hashim et al. [11] has addressed this issue in an article in the Annals of Surgery 2014. They reported poor results in tumours larger than 1.5 cm located in the head with Ki67 index greater than 20% and lymphovascular invasion. Involvement of lymph nodes has been reported to have a bearing on survival following resection (4.5 years with and 14.6 years without lymph node involvement). This highlights the importance of lymphadenectomy while undertaking resection for pancreatic NETs. 7. Management of chronic pancreatitis in children. When the pancreas is grossly damaged making a patient nearly invalid with pain, diabetes and exocrine deficiencies, total pancreatectomy with pancreatic islet cell autotransplantation can be successfully undertaken as has been shown by Chinnakotla et al. [12] . In a report of 75 children they have shown relief from pain in 90% of children.",

Larger stent (11.5 Fr) is difficult to insert, and does not provide longer patency [1] . When the situation demands, instead of a single larger diameter stent, side by side 10 FR plastic stents can be placed. In one such study, this approach has been reported to have a long patency of 221 days [2] . Presumably bile flows not only through the stents but also along the side of the stents (if the lumen gets blocked). This practice can address the issue of a blocked stent which is common in plastic stents for which the only other alternative is placement of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS). SEMS has a better patency profile than plastic stents. Unfortunately, these are more expensive. SEMS have problems such as occlusion due to reflux of food particles. To solve this particular problem, partially covered stents have been developed. The other alternative is use of SEMS with distal antireflux valve. In one study this latter type of stent has been shown to have significantly less reflux-related cholangitis [3] . SEMS can be covered or uncovered. Covered stents have been compared with plastic stents and have a better patency rate (roughly 385 days versus 153 days with plastic stents) [4] . Covered SEMS have not shown any significant superiority over uncovered ones. More importantly, covered stents are more costly, more likely to migrate and cause more cholangitis than uncovered SEMS [5] . However, in a randomized trial published in the Americal Journal of Gastroenterology in 2013, Kitano et al. from Japan have reported better patency rate with covered stents. Stent dysfunction free survival was also better. Even the re-intervention rate was less in the covered stents than in the uncovered group. Stent migration, acute pancreatitis was similar in the two groups-covered or uncovered [6] . Results quite different from the above have also been published. In one such study, Lee et al. have reported no difference in recurrent stent blockage rate, survival or undesired side-effects with either stent. Uncovered stents were blocked more frequently by tumour ingrowth and covered stents migrated and caused pancreatitis more often than uncovered stents [7] .",

The latter is particularly more difficult if re-intervention is needed.

Benign biliary strictures (or injuries) are commonly managed with plastic stents; largely because of its simplicity, wide availability and less cost. However, to maintain a large diameter of the common bile duct multiple stents need to be used. Plastic stents need frequent change. These factors go against the use of plastic stents for benign biliary diseases and have prompted various workers to use covered SEMS. Placement of one SEMS is enough for longterm use. With its use for stricture of bile duct due to chronic pancreatitis-over 60% of stricture resolution has been noted by some [8] . Strictures due to other causes regressed even more.

The product is available in powder form, aqueous solution and as a pad. These have properties by which erythrocyte concentration increases which then participate in the normal coagulation process. The agent also forms a scaffold of encapsulated protein to facilitate clotting [2] . These agents have been successfully used in the control of epistaxis, dental bleeding, and bleeding during urologic and paediatric surgery [3] . From these observations the method has been extended to endoscopic control of variceal bleeding. 2. Endoclot haemostatic spray: This preparation too is from plants. It is available in powder form. It is directly sprayed over the site of bleeding through an endoscope, or else it can be delivered by a powder/gas mixing chamber connected to each of the two elements [4] . The product absorbs water at the site of application allowing concentration of platelet, RBCs, and coagulation proteins which facilitate quickened haemostasis. The method has been tried in the management of raw surface bleeding after endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). With this, effective haemostasis has been achieved. Encouraged with the success, prophylactic spraying has been suggested after EMR irrespective of the presence of post-procedure bleeding [4] . 3. Haemospray utilizes the haemostatic agent T-325. This is a synthetic product and has no human, animal or plant ingredients. It acts by absorption of water allowing concentration of various products of coagulation. Clot thus formed then acts as a pressure agent. The product comes in a canister which is handheld. This is connected to a spraying catheter. For better efficacy it should be sprayed at least 1-2 cm away from the site of bleeding. The method has been used by Leblanc et al. [5] in various causes of bleeding (like following ampullary resection and biliary sphincterotomy). It was used as the primary mode of treatment and the result was extremely gratifying with immediate control of bleeding. Even when it was used as second line of treatment it was found effective. It has also been used for control of bleeding from malignancies of the stomach, oesophagus and pancreas with gratifying results. A multicentre study utilizing haemospray has also been published [6] . In this study 63 patients of non-variceal GI bleeding were included. In these, haemospray was used as a safe primary therapy with 85% successful haemostasis.",

Based on these, polyps can be low risk (one or two, less than 1 cm in size) or high risk (3 or more lesions, larger than 1 cm and villous adenoma) [17] . Hyperplastic polyps, though not considered premalignant in the past, are now considered serrated polyps and have been considered to be associated with cancer in 20%-35% of cases. This is related to methylation of CPG, BRAF mutation with inactivation of MLH1 leading to microsatellite instability. The incidence of serrated polyps is reported to vary between 2% and 70% [18] .",

Two different meta-analysis have shown reduction in mortality [2, 3] with early feeding within 24 hours. The first study also demonstrated reduction of pneumonia in those patients. This study, however, did not show any reduction in multi-organ failure [2] . Two more recent studies defined early feeding as within 48 hours of acute illness. None of these studies showed reduction in mortality [4, 5] . The issue of 24 hours and 48 hours as the definition of 'early' feeding thus continues to be debated. Within this diverse result, one can only say that starting nutrition within 48 h can be defined as 'early'. As of now no study exists which compares results of feeding starting at 24 hours and 48 hours -it is desirable that such a study is initiated to address the issue properly.",

In view of all these problems of enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition has been advised by many a specialist. It thus became a ready source of nutrition (quite often supplementing enteral feeding). It can deliver the necessary caloric needs of a patient when enteral feeding can not be achieved in critically ill patients. This does not undermine the value of enteral nutrition. In fact, whenever possible one should provide enteral nutrition because it can stimulate brush border enzymes necessary for absorption. Enteral feed effectively maintains or increases immunity and prevents bacterial translocation. It also maintains integrity of the intestinal epithelium including height of microvilli [7] . Thus, it is only when enteral feeding is not possible or when adequate calorie supplementation is not possible through enteral feeding, one should consider parenteral nutrition. In fact European guidelines recommend this strategy [8] . The American guideline too recommends this, the difference being that it defers parenteral therapy after 1 week [9] . The issue of supplemental parenteral nutrition at days 2 and 8 has been studied by Casaer et al. [4] . They concluded that recovery was faster with fewer complications with later therapy than early one. They recommended only glucose infusion initially and adding protein and lipids gradually over a period of time. A subsequent analysis of the same study had however shown detrimental effects of both excessive enteral and parenteral feeding initiated from days 3-7. In fact it was shown that patients receiving excess feeding (day 3 through day 7) are unlikely to leave ICU alive [10] .",

Only recently, some light has been thrown on the subject. One study [12] has compared trophic feeds (early low dose enteral feed-given at a rate of 10 ml/hours) and early full calorie feed (25 ml/hours with increment every 6 hours until total calorie needs are met) given for the first 6 days of intubation. This study did not find any significant difference in clinical outcome. ICU stay, ICU death and ventilator withdrawal remain same in both groups. The EDEN study which adopted a similar protocol in a large randomized trial failed to show any difference in mortality, infection and ventilator free life between the two groups [5] . Nearly 50% of these patients were available for follow up at 6 months and 12 months. Long term results evaluated were cognitive domain and physical strength following trophic and full calorie feeds. There was no difference in either in both the arms [13] . Based on the currently available evidence one can conclude that nutrition should be started within 48 hours of intubation in the ICU. Enteral nutrition should be used in the beginning. If enteral feed is not tolerated or not possible, one can supplement with parenteral nutrition. For enteral feeding trophic feed is preferred as the full calorie feed does not have any extra benefit.",

            "text": "In this review the following are discussed:1. Are patients offered surgery uniformly for management of pancreatic cancer?Bilimoria et al. [1] do not think so. They have reported that 40% of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer are never offered surgery. They considered this a 'national failure' (Heading of the article reads so!). He is not alone, Abraham et al. [2] reported that analysis of the records of 20,312 patients showed 37% were resectable at the time of diagnosis (i.e. 7585 patients). Of these 7585, only 3034 patients (40%) were offered surgery. This is particularly so for black and poor patients. 2. Readmission after surgery for pancreatic cancer is often considered an index of poor quality of care; leading to increased hospital stay, perioperative mortality, readmission mortality, etc. However, readmission can not necessarily be related to either the surgeon or the hospital (high volume centre). In a recent study authors have shown that readmission may be related to patients co-morbidity and not to the above two. Therefore, readmission rate alone should not be a quality measurement tool for the surgeon or the centre [3] . 3. Pancreatic cancer surgery has been shown to be safe in elderly patients. However, one must carefully select the right patients for this demanding surgery. Preoperative assessment using various geriatric assessment strategies can identify patients with a high risk of complications. Those identified to have high risk can be properly counseled against high risk surgery like pancreaticoduodenectomy [4] . 4. Extended pancreaticoduodenal resections including resection of vascular structures are being increasingly practiced by increasing number of surgeons. How justified is this strategy? To answer this Bhayani et al. [5] analysed results of 9927 patients and showed increased morbidity and mortality. A report from Massachusetts General Hospital similarly showed prolonged hospital stay, high ICU stay and high readmission rates [6] . A randomized trial has also been con-",

In this condition, normal squamous epithelium undergoes metaplasia resulting in its replacement with columnar epithelium. Varying degrees of dysplasia subsequently occur (from no dysplasia to low grade dysplasia to high grade dysplasia; being 86%, 10%, 20% in incidence) [1] . Barrett's oesophagus is the forerunner of oesophageal adenocarcinoma which has a very poor prognosis. The risk of cancer is 30 times more than in patients who have no Barrett's [2] . Thus, it was thought that with surveillance the disease can be detected early when results of treatment are likely to be better. But it is debated if surveillance is cost-effective and if it has any survival benefit. With reference to the latter, a relatively recent work has not shown any benefit [3] . In addition, a report from USA revealed that the incidence of cancer in Barrett's oesophagus is decreasing [4] . This may negate the very idea of surveillance as a tool to diagnose cancer early. In the light of these, risk stratification of Barrett's is logical. Dysplasia has long been regarded as a risk factor of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Other risk factors identified in recent times are:1. Presence of intestinal metaplasia has been reported to have 3-fold higher incidence versus no metaplasia [5] . This may be related to excess biological instability [6] . 2. Length of Barrett's is also a risk factor. Long segment has 7 \u00d7 higher risk for cancer [7] . 3. Presence of ulcer in Barrett's is another factor for tumour progression [7] . 4. Inactivation of \u00fe16 and \u00fe53 (tumour suppressor genes) also has a higher risk of cancer [8] . 5. Active human papilloma virus (genotype 16 and 18) through causing dysplasia may induce cancer [9] .Notwithstanding the issues of cost and unconvincing survival benefit of a surveillance strategy-it is still advocated by the American and British Societies of Gastroenterology.",
