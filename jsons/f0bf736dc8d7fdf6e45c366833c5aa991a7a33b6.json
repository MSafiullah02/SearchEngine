Primarily affecting the human respiratory system, SARS-CoV2 has some impact on the human brain, but apparently minimal on the cerebellum, at least so far. Neurological involvement in the acute phase appears to manifest with confusion, dizziness, impaired consciousness, propensity to develop acute strokes, anosmia, hypogeusia, ataxia, epilepsy, and neuralgia. Cerebellar scholars are facing a time of uncertainty. Telemedicine has suddenly emerged as an alternative to follow patients. There is an urgent need to develop novel platforms to assess and follow ataxic patients remotely, especially because cerebellar patients often require ambulatory care to maintain their autonomy.",

The source of the current global challenge is the malignantly pathogenic coronavirus that emerged from Wuhan, China, leading to highly contagious and novel condition called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

Fast tracked literature revealed that in its acute phase, compared with the impact on the respiratory system, the human brain appears relatively spared, generally causing confusion (9%), dizziness (17%), impaired consciousness (8%), propensity to develop acute strokes (3%), anosmia (6%), hypogeusia (6%), acute cerebrovascular diseases (3%), ataxia (1%), epilepsy (1%), and neuralgia [3] . Details on so-called ataxic signs are missing. While reported neurological deficits were from those who were symptomatic, the \"asymptomatic\" patients had commonly experienced anosmia and hypogeusia [4] . Respiratory distress is one of the recognized causes of the morbidity and mortality of this disease obviously, and impairment in central respiratory drive secondary to the brainstem involvement is plausible [5, 6] . Our colleagues in Italy have treated increasing numbers of patients with cerebrovascular events; the virus might affect coagulation mechanisms. While in acute phase COVID-19 does not seem to involve the cerebellum, we do not know its chronic consequences. We are especially worried about the consequences of social isolation on the cerebellar patients who are dependent on rehabilitation services and exhibit emotional, social, or cognitive fragility.",

As of now, COVID-19 has affected millions people worldwide and has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, and the global census of COVID-19-positive patients is growing day-by-day. As much as the reality associated with this malignant fraction of RNA, the fear of contracting it makes our world anxious. Often, people do not know what to believe and what not to believe. Call it a response to anxiety, defense mechanism, or simply a sense that \"we are all in the same boat\"; we have been noticing a sense of warmth and care around us, not only from the near and dear ones but also from total strangers. We feel that people have become less selfish, more cognizant, and understanding. Several questions arise: how to maximize our ability, how to utilize remote monitoring practices, and satellite meetings. Social isolation, shortage of equipment, and difficulties for face-to-face teaching and mentoring are pushing telemedicine. We have minimal doubt that such a practice pattern if followed even after we get relief from COVID-19 will only do better for our professional and personal life. The cerebellum community will not be an exception to this novel rule.",

Unfortunately, ambulatory services are often closed and rehabilitation services at home and in rest houses or assisted living facilities have dropped dramatically, impacting in particular on deambulation. Restrictions are impacting on autonomy of patients. There is an urgent need to develop novel platforms to assess and follow ataxic patients remotely. This needs to include not only the sensorimotor aspects but also neuropsychological care and therapies administered. A typical example is the difficulties to perform studies requiring close contacts with patients. Cerebellar patients are particularly vulnerable. While the cerebellar scholars prepare the scientific infrastructure, we urge the healthcare authorities to help us promote these novel platforms. The cerebellum community has a major role to play to validate these novel technologies at a worldwide level. There was a time before COVID-19 and there will be a time after COVID-19.",
