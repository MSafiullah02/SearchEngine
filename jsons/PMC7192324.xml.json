            "text": "Dehydration and acidosis, which develop during acute diarrhoea in newborn calves, are best corrected by oral or parenteral use of solutions containing electrolytes and glucose, but rehydration solutions contain insufficient amounts of energy and nutrients to meet the animal's requirements. The question of whether calves suffering from diarrhoea should receive milk is controversial. The activity of the small intestinal \u03b2\u2010galactosidase (lactase) is reduced in calves with diarrhoea ( Tzipori et al., 1983;\nTorres\u2010Medina et al., 1985). Lactase deficiency would theoretically result in malabsorptive diarrhoea with loss of fluid and electrolytes when milk feeding is resumed. On the other hand, the use of oral rehydration solutions as the sole feed for several days results in reduced regeneration of the intestinal mucosa and in starvation (\nHeath et al., 1989). The feeding of milk which has been incubated with lactase should theoretically alleviate the problems related to insufficient endogenous lactase synthesis. Humans who suffer from lactose maldigestion respond favourably to milk which has been treated with lactase (\nSuarez et al., 1995), and the successful use of lactose\u2010hydrolysed milk in a calf which presumably suffered from congenital lactase deficiency has been described (\nOlchowy et al., 1993). Although this procedure could theoretically be useful in diarrhoeic calves with reduced intestinal lactase activity, there is no published report on the use of lactase in calves with diarrhoea. In the present study the hypothesis was tested that calves suffering from infectious enteritis suffer from lactose malabsorption due to lactase deficiency, and that under these circumstances the use of lactose\u2010hydrolysed milk improves sugar absorption.",

When watery diarrhoea had lasted over 12 h, they were chosen to participate in the study. Faecal samples were collected and were analysed for enteropathogenic bacteria, for Cryptosporidium, rotavirus and coronavirus. The calves, who were able to stand and to suckle, received an oral rehydration solution containing glucose, glycine and electrolytes (Rehydran\u00ae; Veterinaria AG, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland; content in mmol/l: glucose, 131; glycine, 120; gluconate, 2; sodium, 85; potassium, 27; calcium, 2; magnesium, 2; chloride, 85; dihydrogen phosphate, 27; sulphate, 1) during the following 24\u201336 h. No medication was administered in addition to the rehydration solution.

Five randomly selected calves received a first test meal of lactose\u2010hydrolysed milk and 24 h later a second test meal of unprocessed whole cow's milk, whereas the other five calves received unprocessed milk as the first test meal and lactose\u2010hydrolysed milk 24 h later. Each calf was offered 0.5 l of milk per 10 kg body weight (BW) during the first absorption test and was allowed to drink for 5 min. The amount of ingested milk was recorded, and on the second test day, each calf was offered the amount of milk which it had consumed the previous day. Between the two test meals, the calves received only 2 l of the rehydration solution (Rehydran\u00ae) but no milk. Blood and breath samples were collected 15 and 5 min before the test meals were fed and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after the test meals. Blood was drawn from the catheter with a syringe. Blood for glucose analysis was put into tubes containing EDTA and sodium fluoride, and blood for galactose determination was deproteinized with perchloric acid immediately after collection. The blood was centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 min within 15 min after sample collection, and aliquots were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until they were analysed. Total exhaled breath gas samples were collected with a breathing bag as described by\nHolland et al. (1986). Briefly, the face mask which was connected by a non\u2010rebreathing valve to a 5 l breathing bag was placed over the nostrils and the mouth of the calves. When the breathing bag was filled with breath gas it was manually compressed and allowed to refill. Breath gas samples were analysed for H2 within 15 min after collection.",

The calves of the present study can therefore be regarded as representative of naturally infected neonatal calves suffering from malabsorption diarrhoea. Since the calves of the research herd were closely supervised, signs of diarrhoea were noticed without delay, and the oral rehydration was started soon after the onset of the disease. The rapid initiation of oral rehydration probably prevented the development of severe signs of dehydration. Nevertheless, the observed increase in breath hydrogen concentration after the intake of milk, a phenomenon which is not seen in healthy calves receiving moderate amounts of lactose (\nNappert et al., 1993), shows that carbohydrate malabsorption occurred in the experimental animals although they had not been critically ill. This finding confirms the observation of\nNappert et al. (1993) that the extent of carbohydrate malabsorption is not dependent on the clinical condition of the calves suffering from diarrhoea.",

In comparison with the blood values in diarrhoeic calves which had received 2 g/kg BW of lactose as an aqueous solution (\nGutzwiller and Blum, 1996), blood galactose concentration reached the peak value much later, and plasma glucose concentration rose to a lesser degree in the calves of this study which had received 2 g/kg BW of sugar in milk. A delay in gastric emptying after the intake of milk instead of an aqueous lactose solution, as has been shown in humans (\nSolomons et al., 1979), is probably the cause of this phenomenon. Results obtained from oral tolerance tests using lactose solutions may therefore differ from the more natural condition encountered during milk feeding. The tendency of the galactose concentration to be lower and to reach a peak later after the intake of milk which contains hydrolysed lactose is an indication that the monosaccharides of the processed milk leave the abomasum more slowly than does lactose of unprocessed milk. A lower rate of galactose absorption would result in a more complete hepatic transformation of galactose to glucose and consequently in a lower galactose concentration in the peripheral blood. The presence of glucose, but not of lactose, in the duodenum has been shown to inhibit abomasal emptying in the milk\u2010fed calf (\nBell and Mostaghini, 1975), which might explain the postulated effect of lactose\u2010hydrolysed milk on abomasal emptying. Since a delayed gastric emptying has been shown to improve lactose tolerance in humans (\nSolomons et al., 1979;\nVesa et al., 1997), lactose\u2010hydrolysed milk should theoretically improve sugar utilization both by delaying gastric emptying and by alleviating the negative effects of lactase deficiency.",

            "text": "These assumptions are not supported by the results of the present trial since the measured breath H2 concentrations, which indicate that carbohydrates were fermented in the large intestine, did not differ between the two treatments. The increased pre\u2010prandial plasma glucose concentration on day 2 of the trial is a sign of the improved energy status of the calves, since milk contains about five times more energy per litre than does the rehydration solution which was administered before the first test day. The fact that plasma glucose concentration after milk intake tended to increase less when pre\u2010prandial glucose concentration was increased demonstrates that, due to hormonal control mechanisms, plasma glucose concentration is not a sensitive parameter for intestinal glucose absorption, as has been shown previously (\nGutzwiller and Blum, 1996). Breath hydrogen determination, which is the most widely used method to measure lactose malabsorption in humans (\nBrummer et al., 1993), is probably better suited to test lactose maldigestion in calves. The results of the absorption tests suggest that a deficiency of endogenous lactase may not play an important role in the pathogenesis of malabsorption diarrhoea in most calves suffering from undifferentiated neonatal diarrhoea. In healthy young milk\u2010fed calves, intestinal lactase is not the limiting step in the process of lactose digestion and the subsequent absorption of glucose and galactose (\nCoombe and Smith, 1973).",

The results of the present study suggest that the impaired capacity of the small intestine to absorb monosaccharides rather than the reduced intestinal lactase activity is the limiting step in carbohydrate utilization in calves with diarrhoea. The study shows that unprocessed cow's milk seems to be just as suitable as lactose\u2010hydrolysed cow's milk for the majority of calves which suffer from diarrhoea caused by viruses or Cryptosporidium. The 10 calves which were used in this study recovered rapidly from the acute disease. Although the severity of the acute diarrhoeal disease does not seem to be correlated with the degree of malabsorption in calves (\nNappert et al., 1993), the results of the present investigation do not rule out the possibility that individual calves suffering from chronic severe diarrhoea might respond favourably to lactose\u2010hydrolysed milk.",
