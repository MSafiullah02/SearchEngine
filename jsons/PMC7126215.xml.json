The first breakthrough was reported in 1988 when the first in vivo studies on humans were performed with the [NaSb9W21O86]18\u2212 polyanion (commonly abbreviated as HPA-23).8 However, HPA-23 caused severe side effects at higher dosages that forced the patients to discontinue the therapy.8 Since then, the search for \u2018second generation\u2019 anti-HIV POMs with reduced toxicity was continued and the [PTi2W10O40]7\u2212 polyanion (abbreviated as PM-19) was, for example, identified as a potential antiviral drug capable of inhibiting the replication of HIV-19 and herpes simplex virus (HSV)10 in vitro.",

As most organic HIV-1 protease inhibitors bind into the active site, larger inorganic cluster molecules, such as POMs, would thus open up new ways of inhibition. Such alternative interaction pathways of POMs with HIV-1 protease would render them less sensitive towards the frequently occurring mutations of HIV-1, thereby circumventing the problem of therapeutic resistance in current AIDS therapy.15 In addition, most anti-AIDS drugs are costly compounds that have to be administered in inconveniently high doses several times a day. POMs would offer economic advantage over the current anti-AIDS drugs in principle, because they can easily be synthesized from readily available precursors in a few synthetic steps.",

However, the development of hybrid and functionalized POMs is now proceeding rapidly18 and thus provides new inspirations for research on inorganic anti-HIV agents together with the incorporation of antiviral POMs into biomacromolecular matrices as an additional strategy.19 The increasing gap between these growing classes of novel POMs and their biomedical characterization inspired us to screen a selected variety of POM types with respect to their inhibitory effect on HIV-1 protease. Firstly, we compared the inhibitory potential of POMs with different cluster sizes. We then focused on Keggin- and Dawson-type POMs with different organic side chains in order to evaluate the influence of the functionalization on the inhibitory performance. In addition, we placed emphasis on methodological issues: the results are critically discussed with respect to their considerable buffer dependence. Furthermore, we present NMR studies in solution to exclude the possibility of POM\u2013substrate interactions.",

HIV-1 protease was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and purified by anionic exchange and size exclusion chromatography according to literature protocols (for further experimental details cf. Supplementary data).23 Given that HIV-1 protease has an autocatalytic activation site as well as autoprotolytic activity,24 special attention must be paid to the high purity of the protein to precisely determine its concentration and to prevent possible interaction of the POMs with degraded protease fragments during the protease assays. For that reason, the substitution of one single amino acid, namely glutamine at position 7 to lysine (Q7K), has been performed to reach a 100-fold increase of the protein stability.24 This residue is located in the first loop after the first \u03b2-strand in the protein and at a considerable spatial distance to the flexible hinge regions that were proposed as POM binding sites.14 Therefore, it can be practically excluded that the use of the HIV-1 mutant Q7K affects the inhibitory potential of the POMs in comparison with the wild type. The introduction of the positively charged lysine might even exert a productive electrostatic effect upon the binding of the highly negatively charged POMs to the protease. Standardized protease assays25 were performed as described in the Supplementary data and an influence of POM absorbance on the measurements was excluded. The protease substrate was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and two different buffer solutions were applied: buffer 1 contained a final DMSO concentration of 10%, whereas the DMSO content of buffer 2 was 1% (for details cf. Supplementary data). The stability of the protease during the assays was confirmed by Selwyn tests,26 known as the standardized enzymatic stability test till date, under both buffer conditions. The inhibitory potential of all POMs was analyzed in triplicate measurements with Saquinavir as a standard inhibitor under both buffer conditions. Furthermore, the ingredients of the two different buffers were compared under the above conditions using POM 25 with a known high inhibitory activity14 (cf. Table 1 and Table S-1). The higher concentration of DMSO and the additional detergent Nonidet P-40 obviously exerted the most significant influence on the measured inhibition (cf. Fig. S-1). Although the additional detergent Nonidet P-40 is supposed to stabilize the protease during the assay,25 the enzymatic reaction also worked in the detergent-free buffer 2 with a lower DMSO concentration. Most importantly, these buffer additive tests show that the POM-induced protease inhibition is not a mere artefact arising from precipitation of protease or substrate during the reaction.",

A first glance at Figure 3 shows that the distinction between Keggin and Dawson type POMs is evened out through the introduction of organic residues: the Keggin type POM 12 with a butyl side chain induced complete inhibition of the protease activity (Fig. 3c). Generally, the introduction of a butyl side chain exerted the strongest inhibitory effect among the DMSO-soluble POMs, regardless of the POM framework or the Dawson regiosomer. This effect is even maintained with a 10-fold excess of the butyl-substituted POM 9. In the case of a propionic acid residue, the Keggin type derivative can as well compete with its Dawson analogs in terms of inhibitory effect (Fig. 3a). In parallel, the attachment of a more complex peptide-based side chain significantly reduced the protease activity irrespective of the POM host structure (Keggin or Dawson type, cf. Fig. 3d).",

In order to detect possible interactions of the peptide substrate with POMs, we used solution NMR techniques. In particular, chemical shift mapping 600 MHz proton spectra were recorded on an approx. 100 \u03bcM peptide solution at pH 5.0 (100 mM acetate buffer) at 27 \u00b0C both in the absence and in the presence of POM 24 that displays significant HIV-1 protease inhibition.14 The two samples were prepared from the same peptide stock solution, to one of which POM 24 was added. The pH was carefully controlled, and differed by less than 0.1 pH units in the two samples. The region of aliphatic protons displayed very little differences, whereas some amide protons experienced small shift changes. Nevertheless, the observed differences in the spectra were very minor (Fig. 4\n). From these changes we estimate that the K\nd is likely to be in the molar range, strongly disfavoring a specific interaction with reasonable affinity and indicating the presence of a low-affinity, non-specific interaction. We conclude from these data that while a low-affinity non-specific interaction of the POM with the peptide does occur, its strength is so weak that it cannot be the reason for the observed inhibition of the substrate cleavage by the HIV-1 protease.",
