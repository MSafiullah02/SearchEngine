In Chap. 7 we described their origin in bone marrow and subsequent migration into the skin aided by chemoattractants and adhesion molecules [37] . In immediate-type hypersensitivity, mast cell activation is triggered by allergen cross-linkage of high-affinity IgE receptors (FceRI) borne on their cytoplasmic membrane and on peripheral blood basophils. Mast cells may be activated by specific allergens or by HRFs (histamine release factors) [46] or chemokines, produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that are part of the cell infiltrate causing skin inflammatory lesions. Cutaneous mast cells are tryptase and chymase-containing mast cells (TC) ( Table 1 .27) and contain in the granules both types of proteases, tryptase and kinase [194] , which are able to induce further degranulation [53] . Tryptase in particular can be viewed as a marker of mast cell activation, since its concentration in lesional skin increases proportionately to histamine concentration [103] . Leukocyte emigration is regulated by vasoactive and chemotactic mediators released from mast cells, inducing a sequential up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules (CD62P, CD62E, CD54 = ICAM-1, and CD106 = VCAM), b2-integrins on leukocytes, and ILs on endothelial, epithelial, and infiltrating cells [91] . In chronic/ idiopathic forms, T lymphocytes (50%) are characteristically found with perivascular distribution, monocytes (20%), mast cells (10%) and no B lymphocytes [103] . CD4 prevails over CD8 [19] . One hypothesis postulates that there is a predominance of activated CD4, as seen in delayed pressure urticaria (DPU) [103] .

CD62E has been found in both groups of patients, but CD54 only in DPU patients [19] .

The increased vascular permeability leads to activation of the plasma kinin-forming system and production of bradykinin, which is especially important in hereditary angioedema.

Moreover, the serum of \u226460% of patients reacting with basophils of healthy donors stimulated in vitro basophil releasability [88, 89, 92] . Consequently, cross-linkage of Aab IgG to FceRI is a pathogenic mechanism peculiar to chronic urticaria, which operates by stimulating or facilitating metachromatic cell degranulation [88] with consequent histamine release [67] . Such Aabs could correspond to HRFs with molecular weight (MW) >100 kD, equally provided with IgG anti-IgE Aabs able to interact with IgE [252] . These data explain why some patients suffer from severe and ongoing symptoms [89] . Basophil histamine release plays a significantly pathogenic role because basophils, when stimulated with anti-IgE that interact with IgE present on basophils, release less histamine [249] , even if the levels are variable between subjects [88, 252] . The easy basophil degranulability acts as an opening key to the gaps between endothelial cells, which allows allergen and CIC to break into the perivascular tissue [225] . The skin histamine content and its releasability are increased in vivo during active disease and in remission. Mast cell release following an allergen challenge is not different between patients with chronic urticaria and normal controls [67] . Therefore, the histamine level increment could depend on a transient functional imbalance more than on an intrinsic mast cell defect [194] .

The classic Lewis triple responses (Fig. 8.3) , produced by subcutaneous histamine injection or by gentle stroking with a smooth object, are paradigmatic of what occurs in urticaria linear erythema; flare and wheal are due, respectively, to vasodilatory (H 1 and H 2 action) and vasopermeability (H 1 action) histamine action, to which is added (for the Immunohistopathology Urticaria is histologically characterized by dilation of venules and capillaries, tissular edema and a predominant perivascular infiltrate, of variable composition and intensity. The histological peculiarity of urticarial wheals is common to all types, independently of etiology; mast cells and related mediators are the cornerstone of the lesions [166] . The more evident alteration is the dermal edema with vascular turgor, secondary to an increased size of endothelial cells: edema and infiltrate preferentially involve the dermal deeper strata, extending in certain cases to subcutaneous tissues, where flushing and itching stimuli are lacking because of the scarcity of capillary bed and nerve endings. The perivascular cell infiltrate is represented, especially in chronic forms, by T-activated lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and mast cells; the clear-cut prevalence of neutrophils is characteristic. Activated T cells are predominant compared to all other cells, followed by mast cells and both B lymphocytes; NK cells are absent [117] . Since this pathology involves the vascular compartment, the etiological agents more frequently responsible are internally transported. In immune processes persistent for >30 min, numerous leukocytes are active, among which neutrophils are disposed between the walls of capillary and post-capillary venules which, if their number increases, may lead to urticarial vasculitis more frequently associated with chronic forms [89] . Eosinophils are seen more rarely, and perivascular infiltrations by lymphocytes expressing the CD4 phenotype are frequently detected [19] . Histopathological evidence in chronic lesions is similar to what is seen in AD and ACD LPRs: vasoactive mediators and chemotactic factors recruit PBMCs, neutrophils, and eosinophils into the cutaneous microenvironment; inflammatory cells in turn stimulate mast cells to dismiss HRFs [46] .

These drugs have a short half-life; thus possible plasma increments are sporadically detected, unlike in patients with mastocytosis or urticaria pigmentosa, who are primarily susceptible because of an increased skin mast cell population [61] . Nonimmunological activation has been demonstrated in several types of idiopathic, heat-and cold-induced, cholinergic, etc. urticaria [60] , which respond to H 1 anti-histamines in the absence of allergens [44] . Urticaria may be caused by a host of agents, including detergents, foods, and endogenous peptides such as endorphins, neuropeptides or tachykinins [131] ; but compound 48/80 and codeine cause histamine release only in the skin mast cell [45] . Likewise, physical stimuli may act on peripheral skin nociceptors, thus inducing neuropeptide release. Experimental evidence demonstrates that SP has a vaso-permeabilizing effect on epithelial cells.

Extravascular fluid leakage to gut edema can lead to hypotension and hemoconcentration [155] . The most severe complication is laryngeal edema, which, when not treated quickly and aggressively, can be lethal; the laryngeal involvement provokes death by asphyxia [169] . Usually an asphyxial crisis is not suddenly precipitated, because in certain cases the attack, before the real appearance of swelling, is preceded by dysphagia, dysphonia and other prodromic signs such as subjective sensation of pharyngeal prickling, pruritus or burning. Subsequently a sensation of painful tension precedes the edema. These are warning symptoms allowing the timely institution of medical therapy, thus eluding tracheostomy [103] . In these patients, oral surgery represents a particular danger since edema can easily progress to upper airway obstruction.

Occasionally the symptoms occur without a break. Triggering factors are cold and certain foods and drugs [42] . Three clinical forms have been described: one is EIA occurring after jogging started within 2 h of any meal (postprandial EIA), another form occurs only following a specific food ingestion, and the third when no food is identified [190] . High histamine concentrations and mast cell degranulation were detected in skin biopsies [190] (see Chap. 20). after 6-24 h or more after pressure has been applied for a period as short as 2-3 min. Pressure areas are diffused and result from prolonged sitting on a nonupholstered seat; wearing tight clothing and straps, watches, belts; wearing tight shoes; or walking, jogging, and climbing ladders. Swelling of the soles of the feet may limit ambulation and become progressively disabling. The typical lesion is painful as it is deep-seated and edematous [183] . The trunk, buttocks, feet and hands are the regions affected in 95%-98% of cases [64] . Reactions persist for 36 h on average and for 86 h at most [64] , so that the more delayed types are practically indistinguishable from delayed dermographism [42] . Immediate forms are full-blown within 30 s to 4 min. Skin biopsies reveal signs of vasculitis with neutrophils in the lower dermis and subcutaneous tissue 4-5 h after peak swelling, then lymphocyte infiltrate after 24-48 h, thus denoting a cellmediated immunity (CMI), with tissue eosinophilia but not in the bloodstream [225] . A mechanism elicited by histamine probably coexists, with participation of axonal reflexes and neuropeptide involvement as SP [156] . The increased IL 1 levels may contribute to leukocyte recruitment and systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise [117] .

In 238 children aged 2-14 years, the prevalence was 24%, with a significant predominance of females (33%) over males (16%) [136] . Following the application of a linear pressure or a gentle friction, there is characteristically the production of a wheal (diameter >2 mm) and flare reaction. If the skin is stroked with a wooden tongue-depressor, a fingernail, an instrument with blunted point (a key), or a retracted ball point pen [156] , within 2-3 min the usual white line secondary to reflex vasoconstriction is followed by pruritus, flushing and a linear edema, which occur exactly in the distribution of the stimulus [111, 175] . A positive response occurring at a stroke pressure of 3.6 g/mm 2 of skin surface or less confirms the diagnosis. Less obvious triggers are pressure from clothes or leaning against a chair [117] . Three types of dermographism have been reported according to the chronology of the wheal and flare reaction, following a stimulus application: Symptoms are more common on the trunk and limbs and are differentiated by the classic triple response because minimal stimuli lead to extreme responses.

Patients complain of pruritus, erythema, edema and wheals of 5-10 mm, within minutes in response to the application to the skin of an even gentle vibratory stimulus and lasting up to 24 h, depending on the stimulus and body sur-forelimbs, occur from 2-3 min to 30 min after exposure to water [156] . On immersion, seven babies became pale, hypotonic, still and unreactive [146] . The lesions may subside after 30 min [156] ; however, recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and stimulation [146] . These features may even go unnoticed [156] . Biopsy specimens of the lesions reveal mast cell degranulation and hyperhistaminemia; also a cholinergic mechanism seems to play a role [183] . The sex ratio is unfavorable to females (2:1) at puberty or pre-puberty age [238] . \u2211 Cholinergic or thermolytic urticaria, also known as generalized heat urticaria, along with dermographism is the most common physical urticaria (5%-7% of all urticaria forms), prevalently affecting adolescents and young adults. Prodromic signs may face area involved. If the stimulus is appropriately intense a systemic reaction may occur, inciting stimuli are motorcycling, toweling, massaging, and the like. A form with delayed onset (4-8 h) and one acquired idiopathic form have been reported [42, 103, 111] . \u2211 Aquagenic urticaria is another rare form: 15 pediatric cases have been recorded [129, 146, 163, 236] .Age ranges from 2-15 months [146] to 7 years [163] ; eight children had associated symptomatic dermographism [146, 163] . A familial tendency has been observed in 11 families [146, 183] , in one family over three generations in association with familial lactose intolerance [213] . Affected individuals develop pinpoint wheals after skin contact with water, snow, or more or less intense perspiration, regardless of the T [183] . The lesions (pruritic wheals of 1-3 mm) predominate on the trunk and, less often on 551 Urticaria-Angioedema Syndrome arise within 2-30 min of the triggering event, consisting of pruritus, tingling, warmth, or burning of the skin [183] . The ensuing cutaneous manifestations are erythematous and wheal-like, 1-3 mm in diameter, with surrounding bright red flares. These may become confluent to form intensely itching papular wheals, which appear abruptly after variations in ambient T or changes in body T following fever, intense sweating after vigorous exercise, hot showers or sauna, intense transient emotional stimuli, often accompanied by symptoms of cholinergic stimulation, such as lacrimation, salivation and diarrhea, with the involved area returning to normal after about 1 h [117, 175, 183] . In severely ill patients, systemic symptoms such as angioedema and cardiovascular, respiratory or gastrointestinal signs may be associated with anaphylaxis [156] . A similar picture can be produced in affected individuals by acetylcholine: it is postulated that pathogenic mechanisms are based on body T increase and the following skin exposure to a warm stimulus can affect the higher nerve centers [197] . Thus, acetylcholine release may be evoked along peripheral nerve endings, also inducing histamine release, probably by a direct action of cholinergic receptors on mast cells [197] . \u2211 Cholinergic cold urticaria occurs when systemic cold contact produces a form similar to cold urticaria [4, 181] . \u2211 Localized heat urticaria, also rare (18 cases) is apparent with immediate urticarial reactions within 5 min after heat application, for example warm water [54] at a T of 43\u00b0C and lasting about 1 h, with increased plasma histamine levels [42] .

On the contrary, atopic sensitization in children and teenagers ranges from 16.7% to 32.6% [7, 56, 85, 199, 212, 214] , with peaks of 50% [63] , with positive FH between 20.7% [199] and 42.1% [80] . As discussed earlier, a large share of children with AD are also affected with ACD, with a prevalence between 16 antigen macrophage [20] . These circumstances result in a cascade of inflammatory events leading to the development of dermatitis or, after a diagnostic FCT, to a hypersensitivity reaction [20] . ACD can thus be classified as a delayed type of hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, in other words, a stage of hypersensitivity associated with an increased number of allergen-specific T cells able to invade the peripheral tissues [105] . The series of immune events that induce ACD implies the interaction, at an undetermined site, between T lymphocytes and epidermal CD1 + LCs (Figs. 7.1, 7. 2), functionally immunocompetent (CD1 + /IgE + ) cells. Early and important participants in the induction of ADC, LCs act as APCs in the initiation of a type IV immune reaction [207] . Mobilization of dendritic cells (DCs) occurs in response to local generation of proinflammatory ILs such as IL 1 and TNF-a. Activated DCs express high levels of CCR7, HLA antigens, and costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, CD86) [33] . Sensitizing allergens contacting the skin activate T lymphocytes. To a subsequent cutaneous contact the duo hapten + carrier is taken up, processed and expressed on the surface of LCs bearing class II HLA-DR molecules [23] . After the allergen-HLA complex presentation, LCs migrate out of the epidermis into the dermis and then into draining lymphatics and on to regional satellite lymph nodes. Within 4-6 h of hapten application, LCs congregate in T-dependent zones; within 18-24 h a great number of LCs are in the draining lymph nodes to present the processed antigen and transfer the sensitization to a large repertoire of specifically sensitized CD4 T lymphocytes bearing CD3 receptors that undergo proliferation and clonal expansion [207] . The antigens interacting with HLA molecules emit the first signal for lymphocyte activation, and the second signal is represented by IL 1 produced by keratinocytes and LCs with the primary function of activating T lymphocytes. This results in the clonal proliferation of antigenspecific memory T cells with the phenotype of CD4 + , CD45RO, CD45RA, which yield a number of ILs, including IL 2 and IFN-g [207] . The coincident presence of both ILs corroborates the conclusion that they are the product of CD4 Th1 specific for contact antigens, in parallel with the delayed reaction of AD [105] . Keratinocytes with their HLA-DR antigens and CD54 (Fig. 8.11 ) act as target cells for activated T cells, and the inflammatory IL they produce attract PBMCs in an allergen-nonspecific way [20] . During the induction phase, the CD4 infiltrated in the dermis proliferate and differentiate into effector cells and release Th1-like ILs (Table 1. 10), capable of inducing capillary vasodilation and permeability increase, thus leading to the allergic skin inflammation [207] . Th1 T cells dominate and amplify the generation of cytotoxic allergen-specific CD8 lymphocytes (CTLs), which leads in the final analysis to cutaneous lesions. As seen from studies on the animal model, both mediate type IV immune responses, Th1 with class II HLA, and CTLs with class I HLA. Suppressor CD8 T cells are subsequently generated, although in a lesser number, thus achieving a balance between sensitization and tolerance, orchestrated by a complex suppressor circuit acting on both afferent and efferent pathways of the DTH reaction [23] . Looked at in more detail, whether sensitization has an effect either on Th1 or Th2 activity depends on the exposure intensity and LC integrity; however, there is no numerical difference between the different T-cell subpopulations in the various phases so far delineated [211] . Intercellular connections are ensured by b1-b3 integrins (Tables 1.45-1.47), which allow cells to migrate into the skin, and IFN-g-stimulated endothelial cells express CD54, more adhesion molecules and class II molecules [251] . This leads to preferential PBMC migration from the bloodstream to the inflamed skin lesions, and circulating T cells, by expressing their ligands such as CD11a/CD18 and CLA, recognize CD54 on endothelial cell and keratinocyte surface membranes activated by IL 1 and can bind these cells [20, 251] . Moreover, PBMCs of patients with ACD presenting antigens to autologous T cells can stimulate the proliferation of the two different subsets, CD45RO + and CD45RA + , potentially recognized by two different epitopes. However, CD3 + , CD45RA and CD8 T cell responses are absent [23] . CD45RO + CD4 + T cells stimulated by antigens reach the maximal expression at 96 h (Fig. 8.12 ), thus suggesting that they are able to induce immediate cutaneous reactions in patch test sites [23] . DTH, thus terminating the response, which is instead up-regulated by its inhibition [71] . TNF-a stimulated with UVB propitiates the reaction by its proinflammatory and vasodilatory effects, but may be critical in inhibiting the migration of epidermal LCs [104] , which produce few ILs [128] . Chemokines such as RANTES and MIP-1b may recruit a higher level of T lymphocytes, with a further increase in local mediators [203] . A distinctive type of reaction involves Ni. Ni-specific T lymphocyte clones recognize the antigen only on the cell surface of LCs in association with HLA class II molecules, whereas they were unable to recognize Ni when presented by monocytes. Therefore, there may be a direct and non-HLA-restricted recognition by T-cell clones; thus Ni might interact directly on the T cell surface structure, with consequent activation and proliferation of these T cells. Since HLA class II molecules are polymorphous and contain mostly three subtypes, all heterozygotic subjects inherit two different alleles for each of these three subtypes, so Ni may be associated with up to six different HLA class II determinants presented by APC, although it is difficult to identify the precise determinant involved [105] .

In parallel, the ANCA/PR3 interaction induces, by mechanisms not yet fully understood, an increased CD62E and CD106 expression, which attaching to epithelium modulates the adhesion of PMN [177] , CD54 and CD102 [78, 148] , which bind their contrareceptors CD11a/CD18, CD11b/ CD18 and CD11c/CD18. In this model, the integrins are necessary for leukocyte adhesion to endothelium. Figure 8 .18 shows the tissues damaged by a complex interaction of cells, with a prominent role played by eosinophil cationic proteins. Additional etiological factors to be considered are genetic and local factors (lesions differentially affecting one organ rather than another), etc. [122] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 170, "text": "[177]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 670, "end": 674, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 865, "end": 870, "text": "[177]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 888, "end": 892, "text": "[78,", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 893, "end": 897, "text": "148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1345, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1055, "end": 1063, "text": "Figure 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Pathophysiological Aspects"}, {"text": "Vasculitis disorders share cutaneous and visceral symptoms [34] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 59, "end": 63, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Presentation"}, {"text": "Cutaneous vasculitis is a condition characterized by infiltrated palpable purpura (erythema not fading on vitropression), with predilection for the lower limbs, with tendency to symmetry and worsening following orthostatism.

Another area of intensifying interest is the demonstration that ILs linked to AECA favor endothelial cell migration, thus modulating the worsening of vascular changes [180] . The changes are multiplied by the high levels of adhesion molecules on endothelium, including CD54, CD102 and von Willebrand factor [78, 148] . Recent data have revealed toxins acting as superantigens (SAs) on Vb2 and Vb8 [51, 123, 243] , produced by microorganisms of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts [51, 147] , in particular by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyrogenus secreting TSST-1 (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) and SPEA/SPEB (staphylococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A and B), respectively [123] . A result still to be weighed is whether CD45RO expression is raised solely on CD8 T cells [165] . There is a tempting suggestion that the intestine encourages causative agent entry such as microorganisms [147, 243] that are producers of toxins with SA properties (Table 8 .22). A novel human coronavirus, designated \"New Haven coronavirus\" (HCoV-NH) was identified in 8/11 infants with Kawasaki disease. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have attracted renewed interest because of the emergence of a novel HCoV associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The median time between the onset of fever and the diagnosis of HCoV-NH was 5 days; 7/11 infants and 19/22 control subjects had respiratory symptoms that were consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) [68] . Table 8 .23 [189] outlines the chief diagnostic and associated symptoms. Useful diagnostic markers could be CD8 T cells [147, 165] and IL 2 R for early diagnosis [21] . Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), divided into classic, infantile and cutaneous PAN [122] , is among the least common in childhood.

The estimated annual incidence was 5.5\u00a510 5 in children <5 years, and was highest in Indian subcontinent Asian children (14.6 \u00a510 5 ) [81] . The incidence rate in Korean children <5 years was (\u00a510 5 ) 73.7 in 2000, 90.8 in 2001, and 95.5 in 2002. The mean age of onset was 30.5 months [162] . This is a multisystem disorder causing substantial symptoms of vasculitis and mucocutaneous lesions with desquamation, after 2 weeks, beginning at the nail-pulp junction (Fig. 8.21 ).

Ongoing antibody synthesis may foster inflammation involving adults. More frequent is cutaneous PAN, manifested by purpura, edema, linear erythema, tender palpable nodules, high fever, arthralgias and myalgias, without important organ system involvement.

This includes several kinds of foods, additives, drugs, and insects that induce urticaria and the countless and dissimilar physical forms, as well as foods and inhalants inducing angioedema. Since urticaria covers a clinical spectrum, it should not be surprising that several skin disorders have urticarial lesions. ACD involving young children is provoked by buttons, clasps, jewels, cosmetics, topical medications, and the ubiquitous latex with latex-fruit and latex-vegetable syndromes and even in the materials employed by dentists. The most important preventive measure for patients with latex allergy or at risk for it is minimizing direct exposure to latex products, most notably latex gloves. Recent operating room studies indicate that simple preventive measures can dramatically reduce intraoperative reactions [30] . Although rare, the different forms of infantile vasculitis are undoubtedly a challenge for most colleagues. The clinical and laboratory findings are variable, frequently nonspecific or overlapping. Therefore early and correct diagnosis is imperative, but one should never delay initiation of treatment, while trying to finalize the diagnosis. These disorders are therefore found in several chapters of infantile allergy and immunology and will put to the test more than ever not only the diagnostic and therapeutic skill of pediatricians, but also their cooperation in light of understandable parental anxieties.With treatment methods designed both to avoid side effects and limit costs, effective approaches will be centered.
