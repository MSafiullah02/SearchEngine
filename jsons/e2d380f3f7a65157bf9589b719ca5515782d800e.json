ArCOV-19 is the first publicly-available Arabic Twitter dataset covering COVID-19 pandemic that includes around 748k popular tweets (according to Twitter search criterion) alongside the propagation networks of the most-popular subset of them. The propagation networks include both retweets and conversational threads (i.e., threads of replies). ArCOV-19 is designed to enable research under several domains including natural language processing, information retrieval, and social computing, among others. Preliminary analysis shows that ArCOV-19 captures rising discussions associated with the first reported cases of the disease as they appeared in the Arab world. In addition to the source tweets and the propagation networks, we also release the search queries and the language-independent crawler used to collect the tweets to encourage the curation of similar datasets.",

            "text": "Twitter streams hundreds of millions of tweets daily. In addition to being a medium for the spread and consumption of news, it has been shown to capture the dynamics of real-world events including the spread of diseases such as the seasonal influenza (Kagashe et al., 2017) or more severe epidemics like Zika (Vijaykumar et al., 2018) , Ebola (Roy et al., 2020) , and H1N1 (Mc-Neill et al., 2016) . Moreover, collective conversations on Twitter about an event can have a great influence on the event's outcomes, e.g., US 2016 presidential elections (Grover et al., 2019) . Analyzing tweets about an event, as it evolves, offers a great opportunity to understanding its structure and characteristics, informing decisions based on its development, and anticipating its outcomes as represented in Twitter and, more importantly, in the real world. Since the first reported case of Novel Coronavirus in China, in November 2019, the COVID-19 topic has drawn the interest of many Arab users over Twitter. Their interest, reflected in the Arabic content on the platform, has reached a peak after two months when the first case was reported in the United Arab Emirates late in January 2020. This ongoing pandemic has, unsurprisingly, spiked discussions on Twitter covering a wide range of topics such as general information about the disease, preventive measures, procedures and newly-enforced decisions by governments, up-to-date statistics of the spread in the world, and even the change in our daily habits and work styles. In this work, we aim to facilitate future research on social media during this complex and historical period of our history by curating an Arabic dataset that exclusively covers tweets about COVID-19. We limit the dataset to Arabic since it is one of the most dominant languages in Twitter (Alshaabi et al., 2020a ), yet still under-studied in general. ArCOV-19 is the first Arabic Twitter dataset designed to capture popular tweets (according to Twitter search criterion) discussing COVID-19 starting from January 27 th till the end of March 2020, constituting about 748k tweets, alongside the propagation networks of the most-popular subset of them. 1 To our knowledge, there is no publicly-available Arabic Twitter dataset for COVID-19 that includes the propagation network of a good subset of its tweets. Some existing efforts have already started to curate COVID-19 datasets including Arabic tweets, but Arabic is severely underrepresented (e.g., (Chen et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020) ) or represented by a random sample that is not specifically focused on COVID-19 (e.g., (Alshaabi et al., 2020b) ), or the dataset is limited in the period it covers and does not include the propagation networks (e.g., (Alqurashi et al., 2020) ). Furthermore, ArCOV-19 includes only popular tweets as we hypothesize that such tweets are more likely to be influential. The contribution of this paper is three-fold:",

We first excluded tweets containing any inappropriate word (using a list of inappropriate words we constructed). Next, tweets with more than two URLs or four hashtags, or shorter than four tokens (all are potentially spam) were dropped. Additionally, duplicate tweets that have exact textual content are also dropped to avoid redundancy; only the most popular of them (according to our scoring criterion below) is kept. Qualified tweets are then scored by popularity defined by the sum of the tweet's retweet and favorite counts. We finally sort the qualified tweets by their scores and select the most popular 1,000 tweets. We denote the set of all such tweets over all days as the top subset.",

Table 1 presents an overall summary of the tweets and users statistics in ArCOV-19. It indicates that The total number of source tweets in the dataset is about 748k posted by about 249k unique users. We note that 14.7% of the tweets were posted by verified users (who constitute only 1.42% of the unique users). This is a relatively large percentage, showing that a good portion of the source tweets are indeed popular. The average numbers of followers, friends, and statuses of users are also relatively large, showing that users observed in ArCOV-19 are also popular (and possibly more influential). The table also indicates that 21.3% of the tweets include URLs. We anticipate that this is due to the extensive spreading of news (linked from tweets) during this period. The numbers of tweets that are geotagged and geolocated are also indicated in the table; however, we defer the discussion of such types of tweets to Section 3.3. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of tweets over time in ArCOV-19. It is clearly non-uniform. Moreover, the volume of tweets hugely increases when the virus started to spread in several countries in the Arab world. The figure also shows the distribution of the tweets posted by verified users vs. unverified users, showing a similar pattern. Figure 2 presents the top 25 tweeting users in ArCOV-19.

It is interesting to see the word \"Allah\" is very frequent early on when the news about the virus started to spread (probably over discussions around whether the pandemic is a punishment from God or not, we believe), then declines over time only to become frequent again when the virus started to widely spread in the Arab world. Figure 3( countries. We can see how it started to be less trending as the number of cases started to decline in China by that date. 13 On the other hand, when COVID-19 started to spread in the Arab world, other hashtags started to become viral. Furthermore, Figure 3 (b) shows that frequency spikes of \"#Iran\", \"#Lebanon\", and \"#Kuwait\" exactly match the confirmation dates of first reported cases in Iran, 14 Lebanon, 15 and Kuwait, 16 respectively. To further analyze trending topics, Figure 3 features the timeline of the first reported cases in the Arab countries and aligns them with the time series throughout the figure. Aligning the timeline with the series in Figure 3 (c) reveals a significant match between the frequency peaks of several country names and the corresponding dates of first reported cases in those countries, most notably in UAE, Egypt, Lebanon, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Algeria, and Libya. Figure 3 also demonstrates the power of ArCOV-19 in capturing further controversial and trending topics.

We further explore the topics discussed in ArCOV-19 by considering the domains of URLs shared in the tweets. We focused on the top tweets subset of ArCOV-19 (constructed as detailed in Section 2.2) and identified the URLs posted in those tweets. We then expanded them (since Twitter URLs are shortened) and dropped URLs of images and videos to focus only on URLs referring to external sources. We extracted 17,308 URLs from 759 unique domains. Figure 4 shows that URLs from news websites are dominantly the most-commonly shared. We observe that these news websites mainly originate from three Arab countries, namely, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. Interestingly, URLs from the China \"Global Television Network\" (cgtn.com) are commonly shared as well, which can be explained by the fact that COVID-19 started in and heavily affected China.",

Alternatively, to have an insight about the geographical distribution and diversity of the tweets in our dataset, we examined the place and coordinates attributes of the Tweet object. 17 We note that the place attribute is an optional attribute that allows the user to select a location from a list provided by Twitter (therefore, the location might not necessarily show the actual location from where the tweet is posted), whereas the coordinates attribute represents the geographic location of the Tweet as reported by the user or client application. Table 1 shows that ArCOV-19 has 20,031 geolocated tweets (i.e., having values in the place attribute) and 486 geotagged tweets (i.e., having values in the coordinates attribute). Those tweets were posted by 9,543 and 82 unique users respectively. The geolocated tweets constitute about 2.68% of the total source tweets, which is slightly higher than what is reported in previous studies on disaster datasets (Anderson et al., 2019) . We anticipate that this is due to the criteria we followed to collect the tweets, which relies on Twitter's popularity criteria. Focusing our attention on the geolocated tweets, Figures 5 and 6 depict the overall and daily distributions (respectively) of those tweets over Arab and other countries. The geolocated tweets were indeed posted by users from 81 countries from around the globe. We Figure 6 : Distribution of geolocated tweets per day.",

The largest contribution of the geolocated content (about 35.3%) comes from Saudi Arabia; this is somewhat expected as Saudi users represent the highest number of active Twitter users in the Arab world. 18 Surprisingly, Kuwait comes second with 12.6% of the geolocated content. We believe the rationale is that it was among the first countries that reported the cases in the Middle East. Since then, Kuwait started a series of strict precautions such as a wide lock-down in many vital facilities until the government had imposed a nationwide curfew. We think, after the curfew, the people become more active on Twitter as a platform to break news and discuss developments of the virus. Additionally, we used related phrases and hashtags to \"Kuwait\", \"Lebanon\", and \"UAE\" among the tracking keywords in the period between 22 of February and 13 of March which demonstrates the reason behind their high percentages during that period, as shown in Figure 6 . Furthermore, it is not surprising to see the countries that have a few or no cases have the smallest portions of contribution to the content. Others have small audience userbases on Twitter (e.g., Tunisia).",

Additionally, lots of discussions focused on the causes of Novel Coronavirus and its rapid spread, which can be studied to understand the stance of users toward different aspects of the situation such as claims, and the consequences of the spread. For example, the catastrophic situation caused by the rapid spread of the virus made hospitals go beyond their capacity, which forced doctors to deal with agonizing life-death decisions triggering heated discussions on such issue. Moreover, in some countries, people are demanding to return resident labors back to their countries to reduce the spread of the virus and limit the country's resources to only citizens.
