Over much of that time, there has been a persistent debate about whether natural selection or random drift is the dominant force in molecular evolution (Kimura 1983; Gillespie 1991). In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the ability to detect natural selection from patterns of DNA sequence variation, and the \u2018selectionist/neutralist debate\u2019 has matured into an effort to estimate the distribution of selective effects on genetic variation (Kreitman 1996; Hey 1999). The strict neutral theory, on the other hand, has become the standard null hypothesis used to approach the study of molecular evolution, even if it is often rejected.",

The fields of conservation genetics and molecular ecology make heavy use of molecular techniques, but generally do so under the assumption that essentially all observed variation is selectively neutral. For example, of the papers published in Molecular Ecology over the last 2 years, only a handful made use of statistical tests of neutrality. The primary goal of this review is to convince molecular ecologists that molecular population genetics can be a fruitful way to study natural selection and adaptation.",

Similarly, there have been numerous reviews of selection on protein electrophoretic variation (e.g. Gillespie 1991; Mitton 1997); in this review I therefore focus exclusively on DNA sequence variation and, in particular, on those aspects of adaptive molecular variation likely to be of most interest to molecular ecologists.",

Second, I review how neutrality tests have been used to study ecological questions, focusing on what types of genes have been found to be subject to selection resulting in rates of evolution or levels of diversity greater than expected under neutrality (positive selection) and discussing in detail several examples likely to be of particular interest to molecular ecologists. Third, the review briefly discusses how failure to test the neutrality hypothesis adequately can produce misleading results focusing particularly on recent developments such as the use of microsatellites. Finally, the review concludes with a discussion of the positive implications of using DNA sequence data to study natural selection, and discusses some of the obstacles that will limit its near\u2010term utility.",

Mutations that are selectively equivalent to the allele(s) already present in the population, on the other hand, are expected to have dynamics governed by genetic drift and to make up the vast majority of the observed variation both within and among species.

For example, there is a broad negative correlation between a nucleotide site's functional importance and its substitution rate. Sites that involve a change in a protein or a change in gene regulation are on average more conserved both within and among species than nonfunctional sites, exactly as predicted by the neutral theory. Additionally, vast parts of the genomes of many organisms contain noncoding DNA that serves no known purpose, and most mutations in these areas are presumably neutral.",

            "text": "A second key aspect of the neutral theory, that most variation has dynamics governed predominantly by genetic drift, is not supported by observed patterns of DNA variation. An important general finding from studies in Drosophila is that there is a positive correlation between a gene's average recombination rate and its level of variability within species (Begun & Aquadro 1992; Aquadro et al. 1994). Similar correlations have been found in humans (2001, 1998), sea beets (Kraft et al. 1998) and maize (Tenaillon et al. 2001). The difference cannot be explained by differences in the neutral mutation rate because there is no correlation between a gene's interspecific divergence and its recombination rate (Begun & Aquadro 1992). The explanation for the correlation appears to be due to the \u2018hitchhiking\u2019 of putatively neutral variation with sites that are under selection. One hitchhiking hypothesis that fits fairly comfortably within the paradigm of the neutral theory is that hitchhiking is due mainly to selection against new deleterious mutations that never reach high frequency (the background selection hypothesis \u2014Charlesworth et al. 1993; Charlesworth 1996). The other hypothesis is that the hitchhiking is due mainly to selection of new beneficial mutations that, because of their rapid fixation, \u2018selectively sweep\u2019 away large swaths of neutral variation in regions of low recombination (Begun & Aquadro 1992; Aquadro et al. 1994; Hudson 1994; Stephan 1995). The relative degree to which selective sweeps and background selection shape patterns of variation across the genome remains unknown, and distinguishing between the two modes is active area of research (e.g. Begun & Whitley 2000; Fay & Wu 2000; Kim & Stephan 2000; Carr et al. 2001; Kauer et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2002).",

            "text": "The correlation between recombination and variation has two important implications for the neutral theory as it is used typically by molecular ecologists. First, regardless of whether the background selection or selective sweep hypothesis is more important, it means that a gene's recombinational environment is a large contributing factor in determining patterns of variation within species. Second, if the selective sweep hypothesis emerges as a major factor in creating the correlation, this would mean that even if much observed variation is selectively neutral, the dynamics of this neutral variation could well be governed more by linkage to selected sites than genetic drift. This is almost certainly true of genes in regions of low recombination, but linkage to selected sites can in theory be important even in regions of high recombination (Gillespie 2000).",

            "text": "Another aspect of the neutral theory that is not well supported by patterns of DNA sequence data is the hypothesis that adaptive DNA variation is expected to be exceedingly rare. Strictly speaking, this may be true on a per nucleotide site basis, considering that many changes in third codon position, introns and noncoding regions may often be selectively equivalent. However, the fraction of genes for which there is evidence of positive selection may be larger than postulated by the neutral theory. The only published study to attempt to estimate systematically the proportion of genes subject to positive selection is that of Endo et al. (1996), who estimated nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios (d\nn\n/d\ns) for 3595 groups of genes extracted from public databases. A d\nn\n/d\ns ratio > 1 provides evidence for positive selection (see Information box). Of the 3595 homologous groups of genes, Endo et al. (1996) found only 17 with evidence for positive selection \u2014 certainly a small fraction. However, their criteria for positive selection, d\nn\n/d\ns > 1 averaged over entire genes, was extremely stringent, considering that in most cases only a small fraction of the sites in a gene may be subject to positive selection (Yang & Bielawski 2000). Simple d\nn\n/d\ns ratios are also far from the only method of detecting adaptive evolution at a gene (Information box). Other methods of detecting selection, particularly those that compare d\nn\n/d\ns ratios within and between species, are expected to be more powerful (Charlesworth et al. 2001; Fay et al. 2001), and have been used to find selection in many genes with simple d\nn\n/d\ns ratios < 1 (Table 1). In addition, there are several examples of selection on noncoding sequences (e.g. Schulte et al. 1997; Wang et al. 1999) which would not be detected with any sort of d\nn\n/d\ns comparison.",

Table 1 is not an exhaustive list of all studies documenting positive selection, but certainly includes the bulk of studies published prior to early 2001.

In some cases, particularly when a gene's function(s) are at least partially understood, it is possible to postulate a plausible adaptive hypothesis for why a gene has been subject to positive selection. These hypotheses can then suggest further experiments or observations that could be used to confirm or refute them as explanations for observed patterns of genetic variation.

For example, patterns of DNA sequence polymorphism can be used to determine if selection acting on a gene is directional (e.g. G6pd: Eanes et al. 1993), balancing (e.g. PgiC: Liu et al. 1999) or both (e.g. Adh: Kreitman & Hudson 1991). High d\nn\n/d\ns ratios among genes that make up a multigene family provide strong evidence that there has been selection for new functions after gene duplication (reviewed by Hughes 1999). The observation of strong directional or balancing selection at a gene or gene region can be a useful tool for determining whether the gene is a good candidate for future functional studies. This approach is particularly powerful if specific nucleotide sites that have been the target of positive selection can be identified. Molecular biologists have long made use of a key paradigm of the neutral theory \u2014 that functionally important parts of a gene will be conserved \u2014 to identify candidate gene regions for further functional study. A similar approach can now be taken by identifying specific variable sites that show statistical evidence for adaptive evolution (Nielsen & Yang 1998; Suzuki & Gojobori 1999; Fig. 1).",

            "text": "A basic goal of physiological ecology is understanding how an organism's metabolism allows it to live in its environment. Many of the proteins that can be studied electrophoretically are involved in energy metabolism. After high levels of allozyme variation were discovered in the late 1960s (Harris 1966; Lewontin & Hubby 1966), many studies were aimed at determining the functional and adaptive significance, if any, of observed variation (reviewed by Mitton 1997). Functional studies have documented that variation in metabolic proteins can affect ecologically important traits such as flying or swimming performance and mating ability (see Powers et al. 1991; Mitton 1997; Watt & Dean 2000 for reviews), and DNA sequence studies have found that many metabolic genes have patterns of variation inconsistent with neutrality (Table 1). Studying allozyme loci at the DNA level is attractive because many of the genes code for proteins whose biochemical roles are well understood and which may contain variation important for understanding the distribution or behaviour of organisms (Mitton 1997; Eanes 1999). Studies of DNA sequence variation at alloyzme genes are particularly useful for acquiring additional insight into the evolutionary history of previously documented allozyme variation, although the inferred histories can complicated (reviewed by Eanes 1999). For example, the first allozyme locus to be studied extensively at the DNA level, alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila (Adh), has a peak of synonymous site polymorphism centred on the site that causes the allozyme polymorphism (Fig. 2: Kreitman & Hudson 1991). This pattern of variation is inconsistent with a simple neutral model, and consistent with a balancing selection model (Kreitman & Hudson 1991). In a more recent analysis of additional Adh sequences, however, Begun et al. (1999) suggest that the evidence of an old balanced polymorphism at Adh is not compelling, in part because the peak of synonymous polymorphism appears to predate the alloyzme polymorphism. Other Drosophila protein polymorphisms also have quite complicated inferred histories based on patterns of DNA sequence variation. For example, Sod, G6pd, Pgm, Tpi, Pgd and Amy all have patterns of variation that are inconsistent with neutrality but that are not suggestive of old balanced polymorphisms (see Table 1 for references). The type of selection occurring at these loci remains obscure, but may involve transient or regionally varying selection or evolutionarily young balanced polymorphisms. One unifying factor in studies of selection in D. melanogaster is its relatively recent migration from Africa, which may have created new selection pressures in non\u2010African populations (Begun & Aquadro 1995; Takahashi et al. 2001; Kauer et al. 2002). Outside Drosophila, other cases in which DNA sequence studies have found or confirmed evidence of positive selection at allozyme loci include Ldh\u2010B in Fundulus (Powers et al. 1991; Schulte et al. 1997; Powers & Schulte 1998), and PgiC in crickets (Katz & Harrison 1997) and several plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana: Kawabe et al. 2000; Leavenworthia sp.: Liu et al. 1999).",

For example, concerns have been raised that modern agricultural plants and animals are becoming increasingly depauperate of genetic diversity and therefore vulnerable to environmental or biological insults their wild ancestors would have resisted (e.g. Notter 1999). Understanding the genetic architecture and history of the domestication process provides useful information for the feasibility and utility of introducing new genetic material from a crop's wild ancestors (Tanksley & McCouch 1997). Agricultural crops have also provided a useful experimental context for addressing fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions applicable to natural systems, including the genetic basis of morphological variation, genetic and ecological interactions between hosts and pathogens and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Finally, many agricultural crops are amenable to extensive transmission genetic analysis such that genes of interest can be located in the genome and cloned. This makes agricultural systems particularly attractive for studying the population genetics of genes that control or influence complex traits (Tanksley & McCouch 1997).",

They then used a prediction of the neutral theory \u2014 that loci that have recently experienced strong directional selection are expected to have low levels of intraspecific variation \u2014 to see if there was evidence for selection at tb1 during the domestiction of maize (Wang et al. 1999). Wang et al. (1999) tested this expectation by sequencing a sample of tb1 alleles from maize and teosinte. They found that the 5\u2032 untranslated region of tb1 had much lower levels of variability in maize than in teosinte, consistent with a selective sweep of that gene region in maize (Fig. 2). An HKA test ( Information box) confirmed that the reduction in variability in maize was inconsistent statistically with neutral evolution.",

For example, in D. melanogaster there is a strong correlation between recombination rate and microsatellite variation similar to that observed for single nucleotide variation and due presumably to the combined effects of background selection and positive hitchhiking (Schug et al. 1998). In contrast, in humans there is no evidence of a correlation between microsatellite variation and recombination, but there is a positive correlation between recombination and single nucleotide polymorphism (Nachman et al. 1998; Payseur & Nachman 2000; Nachman 2001). The lack of a correlation between microsatellite variation and recombination in humans is due apparently to the high mutation rate of human microsatellites (\u223c10\u22124, references in Payseur & Nachman 2000). Microsatellites in regions of low recombination will have the same reduced coalscent times as other sequences in the same regions, but may not have reduced levels of variation in humans due to mutational saturation (Wiehe 1998). In contrast, in Drosophila microsatellite mutation rates are much lower (\u223c10\u22126), take longer to become mutationally saturated and therefore have patterns of variation that are influenced more readily by background selection or selective sweeps (Schug et al. 1998).",

In Drosophila, where considerable progress has been made dissecting the genetic basis of quantitative traits, the distribution of genic effects for several traits is roughly exponential with a few genes of large effect and many genes of small effect (Mackay 2001). If this patterns holds for other traits and other species, it would mean that most traits will be influenced by some genes of large effect. Genetic mapping experiments in other species do generally find quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effect (e.g. Schemske & Bradshaw 1999; Peichel et al. 2001), but in these studies individual QTL almost always encompass large chromosomal regions containing hundreds of genes, so the effects of individual genes cannot be evaluated without extensive additional genetic analysis (Flint & Mott 2001).",

Pogson et al. (1995) took this approach in their study of genetic variation in Atlantic cod. They surveyed variation initially within and among cod populations at a group of randomly cloned cDNA fragments, and found that as a class the random clones had greater levels of diversity among populations than did allozyme loci, suggesting the action of natural selection on one or both classes of loci. Pogson (2001) conducted a detailed analysis of sequence variation at one of the random clones and found that the gene (pantophysin) had d\nn\n/d\ns > 1 within cod populations. That observation provided additional evidence for positive selection, although the form of selection and even the gene's function remain obscure (Pogson 2001). There is no way to know how often such random searches can be expected to find genes of interest, but this example suggests that developing methods of scanning genomes for positively selected genes would be worthwhile.",

D. melanogaster is one of the best understood animals genetically and developmentally, and studies in the species have led to fundamental advances in population genetics (Aquadro et al. 1994; Hey 1999). Despite this wealth of knowledge, D. melanogaster has been the subject of relatively few ecological studies and the ecological factors causing selection on even the famous Adh polymorphism are not well understood (Hughes 1999).

Over the last 20 years, investigators have made substantial progress in their ability to read and make sense of the historical information stored in DNA sequences. As more genes are sequenced and their allelic diversity analysed within and among species, the challenge will be not so much to find genes that have evolved under positive selection but to understand causes of the selective pressures.",

(1987) developed the first statistical test of neutrality to take advantage of the greater information content available from DNA sequence data compared to protein electrophoretic data. The test is based on the expectation that under an infinite sites neutral model (appropriate for DNA sequence variation within and among closely related species) the level of polymorphism at a gene within a species is proportional to the amount of divergence at that gene between species. This expectation can be tested by comparing levels of polymorphism and divergence at two or more genes using Hudson et al.\u2032s (1987) test statistic. The HKA test can be applied to both DNA sequence and RFLP data, and has been used commonly to test for departures from neutral expectations (Table 1). The HKA and related tests, like the earlier tests designed for allozyme data, makes specific assumptions about population structure which, if violated, can lead to rejection of the neutral model for reasons other than positive selection (Ford & Aquadro 1996; Ford 1998). Sliding window graphs (Fig. 2) are a method of visualizing the HKA concept, and identifying specific regions of a gene responsible for the departure from neutral expectations. 1996, 1998) has developed a formal statistical test using the sliding window approach.",

The test statistic, D, is based on the difference between two estimators of the neutral polymorphism parameter 4N\ne\n\u00b5, one based on the total number of polymorphic nucleotide sites observed and the other based on the average number of differences between all pairs of sequences sampled. Under neutrality, both methods are expected to produce the same value, and Tajima's D statistic is designed to test whether the difference between them is unlikely to be observed by chance alone. The test is essentially a method of testing the fit of the data to the expected neutral site frequency distribution, with negative D\u2010values indicating an excess of rare variants and positive values indicating an excess of intermediate frequency variants. Like the HKA test, Tajima's test can be used on both RFLP and full sequence data. The test is sensitive to violations of its demographic assumptions and is not particlarly powerful (Tajima 1989;, Simonsen et al. 1995), so interpretation of test results can be uncertain. Fu (1997) discusses a number of similar tests.",

The idea behind the test is that if synonymous mutations are essentially neutral because they do not result in a change in a protein, the rate of synonymous site evolution (d\ns) will equal the mutation rate (Kimura 1983). Nonsynonymous mutations, because they result in a change in a protein product, are more likely to be subject to natural selection. If most nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious, then the rate of nonsynonymous evolution (d\nn) will be lower than neutral rate, resulting in d\nn\n/d\ns < 1. If a substantial fraction of nonsynonymous mutations are beneficial, however, the average rate of nonsynonymous evolution can be higher than the neutral rate, resulting in d\nn\n/d\ns > 1. Conceptually, all that is involved in performing a d\nn\n/d\ns ratio test is estimating the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between two sequences and the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the sequences and then performing a statistical test to determine if the difference between the two ratios is greater than expected by chance alone. In practice, complications such as accounting for multiple substitutions at the same site, estimating the number synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, and accounting for transition/transversion ratios add considerable complexity to the problem, especially for highly divergent sequences (Nielsen 1997; Yang & Nielsen 2000).\n",

In addition to providing potentially more accurate d\nn\n/d\ns estimates (Yang & Nielsen 2000), the likelihood approaches allow estimation of d\nn\n/d\ns for individual branches of a phylogenetic tree, estimation of the proportion of codons in a sequence that are subject to positive selection, and identification of specific codon sites that are likely to have been subject to positive selection (Nielsen & Yang 1998, Fig. 1). Suzuki & Gojobori (1999) have developed an different method of detecting positive selection at single codons that uses a parsimony approach (see Suzuki & Nei 2001 for an initial comparison of the two methods).",

Under neutrality, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms with species is expected to be the same as the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous differences between species (Sawyer & Hartl 1992). One striking finding that has emerged from using the test is that animal mtDNA genes generally have a greater number of nonsynonymous polymorphisms within species than expected compared to nonsynonymous divergence among species (e.g. Rand & Kann 1996), apparently due to weak selection against slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations (Nielsen & Weinreich 1999).\n",
