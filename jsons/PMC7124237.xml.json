To help relieve the burden of unsafe drinking water, we are in search of an adsorption material that can remove pathogens from water. This material would ideally form a microfiltration membrane that would require low back pressures, but have the ability to clean non-potable water.",

Fiber diameter decreases with increasing HTCC content. Our results are consistent for conductivity and fiber diameter to those of Alipour et al.7 however, our increase in viscosity is not consistent with the reported decrease in viscosity.7 This may be due to the different molecular weights of chitosan and PVA used in each work. From SEM images, shown in Figure S2, the density of fibers formed from a 10 w/v% polymer blend greatly decreased once the HTCC content reached 50% of the total polymer content. This is consistent with other\u2019s findings for 12 w/v% HTCC\u2013PVA solutions.7 We desired the highest amount of HTCC as could be electrospun for water purification applications.

The average nanofiber diameter significantly decreased with an increase in the applied voltage, which is similar to the data found previously.7, 10 This is likely due to an increased charge density on the polymer solution as the voltage increases. The greater Coulombic repulsive forces cause the polymer jet to accelerate faster and to have an increased stretch.26 In addition, the average diameter of nanofibers increased with an increase in the feed rate. This is likely due to insufficient time available for the electrospinning solution to evaporate, resulting in fusing of the fibers together at the higher feed rate.27 This can be seen in Figure 6. This demonstrates that we can control the fiber diameter. In the future, we will explore how fiber diameter effects virus removal.",

The log removal value (LRV) was used to describe the virus removal and the equation can be found in Section 4.2.5 of the Methods section. The fibers were tested for their ability to remove two different viruses, porcine parvovirus (PPV) and Sindbis virus. PPV is a nonenveloped virus and Sindbis is an enveloped virus. These viruses represent two distinct classes of viruses that could contaminate water. A range of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are typically used to evaluate generic virus removal techniques.28 The water-stable nanofibers achieved a 3.3 LRV for PPV and a 4.2 LRV for Sindbis. No virus was removed when only blank filter paper with no crosslinking was contacted with the virus. Crosslinking of blank filter paper (the control) did remove some virus. This demonstrates that the glutaraldehyde, even after water washing, has some virus adsorption properties. Nevertheless, the addition of nanofibers greatly increased the virus removal as compared to glutaraldehyde exposed filter paper (the control). The maximum theoretical removal was 4.4 LRV. These values come close to or exceed the EPA regulation of a 4 LRV for virus removal processes.29 This is a clear demonstration that these stable nanofibers have the ability to bind to two different viruses and could become a new material for virus removal in drinking water applications.",

We pursued this polymer for the creation of electrospun membranes that remove pathogens from drinking water. To realize this goal, we have examined the crosslinking of glutaraldehyde vapor to impart water stability to HTCC\u2013PVA nanofibers. It was found that using high glutaraldehyde concentration and crosslinking time created a membrane that was stable for a minimum of 6 h in water with a maximum swelling degree of 30%. The water-stable nanofibers had a high virus removal, with an LRV of 3.3 and 4.2 for a non-enveloped and an enveloped virus, respectively. This is approaching or exceeding the EPA regulation of 4 LRV.29 With careful design of a filtration apparatus, along with other polymer modifications, this system has high potential to become a future pathogen removal system for water purification.",

The clear solution was concentrated under vacuum with a Buchi R-200 rotavapor (New Castle, DE) at 70 \u00b0C.
