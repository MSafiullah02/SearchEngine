In the suscecptible-latent-infectious-recovered model (figure 1 in the main paper and webtable 1), a risk factor can increase the risk of latent infection by increasing the transmission parameter, or that of progression from latent infection to infectious disease by increasing the progression parameter. On the basis of results from recent meta-analyses, 1,2 we used a larger effect size for the association of smoking or indoor air pollution with latent infection (relative risk=1\u00b79 for smoking and 1\u00b74 for indoor air pollution) than with progression (1\u00b75 for smoking and 1\u00b71 for indoor air pollution). In the sensitivity analysis, we varied the relative importance of the effects of smoking on latent infection and on progression. This sensitivity analysis shows that the effects of smoking on TB disease would be larger if smoking has a larger proportional effect on progression than on transmission. The results for optimal DOTS are shown in webfigure 8. This also highlights the need for further research to better differentiate the effects of TB risk factors on transmission versus on progression.",

For example, in Jiangsu province, we varied the value of transmission parameter around the best-fit value of 1\u00b74, with a range of 0\u00b72-2\u00b72 (the range was obtained by allowing the root mean square of the differences to be three times bigger than that of the best-fit). This range, in turn, led to an estimated 10-36% decline in tuberculosis incidence if both risk factors gradually decline to zero between 2003 and 2033, compared to its best-fit estimate of 24%. We also examined sensitivity to the progression parameter by changing the original value of 0\u00b703 to a range of 0\u00b702-0\u00b704. To match the observed trends of tuberculosis prevalence, lower or higher values of the primary progression parameter are compensated by higher or lower fitted values of transmission parameter. The combined effects of these two changes on the estimated effects of smoking and indoor air pollution are small, because the risk factors affect both latent infection and progression.",
