Exposures may occur inadvertently, may not even be recalled, or may result from lapses in technique leading to accidental inoculation. However, not every exposure results in infection. A risk assessment for infection based on the host's immune system, mechanism of the exposure, infectious dose of the exposure, virulence of the agent, use of personal protective equipment, and immunization status needs to be performed. The accurate quantification of such risk is unfortunately difficult, because there is no systematic reporting system that monitors the number of laboratory-related exposures and infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently convened a committee to address these issues that will, I hope, provide evidence-based guidelines on exposure risk and use of PEP.",
