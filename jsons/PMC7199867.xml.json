Interruptions to planned care (e.g. for cancer) and even to non-elective care are likely to cause a modest but significant spike in non-COVID-19-related deaths. For example, one study showed that most head and neck cancers double in size within 1\u20133 months (Jensen et al. 2007). Delays to screening or management are likely to generate a much higher caseload of late-stage disease.",

In general, health outcomes improve during recessions, mostly driven by fewer cardiovascular-related deaths possibly as a result of more active lifestyles (Strumpf et al. 2017). On the other hand, some disease outcomes worsen, such as suicides (Reeves et al. 2012) and treatable cancers in countries without universal health coverage (Maruthappu et al. 2016). In this recession though, the pandemic-enforced home isolation could mean that the aforementioned cardiovascular benefits do not materialise, leading to a net rise in mortality rates.",

Health system capacity along with the number of new cases and hospitalisations over time, and the emergence of new pharmaceutical interventions are critical inputs to an exit strategy. There are at least three benefits to making plans for an exit strategy now. First, it returns focus on the system capacity measures and pharmaceutical interventions that can save lives independent of non-pharmaceutical demand management measures. Second, it gives visibility to government departments and other organisations on what needs to be put into place for a successful recovery once measures are lifted. Finally, it generates public confidence in policy makers possibly improving adherence to ongoing demand management measures.",
