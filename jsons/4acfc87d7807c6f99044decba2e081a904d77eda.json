However, to study the asymptotics of P (M = n, D < \u221e), we need to know exactly what P n 2 (1, n, +) is, or at least, to find out its asymptotics. By constructing a new Markov chain related to Y \u2032 and analyzing the hitting probabilities of the new chain, Lemma 10 below shows that P n 2 (1,n,+) P n+1 2 (1,n,+) \u2192 2, so that the term P n 2 (1, n, +) in (8) can be estimated. The formula for 1 \u2212 P n (1, n + 1, +) in (9) looks somewhat simple, but some special techniques are required to give its estimation. In Lemma 11 below, with the help of (7), by a delicate analysis of the product N s \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 N n and the continued fraction, we show that 1\u2212P n (1, n+1, +) \u223c c \u03be 2 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03ben n+1 s=2 \u03be 2 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03be s\u22121 , as n \u2192 \u221e.
