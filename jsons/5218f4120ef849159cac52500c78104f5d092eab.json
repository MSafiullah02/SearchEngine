Many coronaviruses are zoonotic, spreading the disease from animals to humans (Mohammadi et al., 2020) . It is a severe illness that has a high attack rate and case fatality rate around the globe. To combat this dramatic situation of COVID-19, our team has provided the importance of Indian traditional medicine as therapeutic approach for COVID-19 (Balachandar et al., 2020a) . Previously, after the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, there was an important question that needed to be answered: will patients recovering from SARS have any re-infection chances? Since the SARS (2002 SARS ( -2003 outbreak, no vaccine has been developed so far, but plenty of people have recovered from this infection, and several follow-up studies have been conducted to check their health status (Tang et al., 2011) . According to a previous report, it is possible that ongoing active alveolitis during the host immune system response to the SARS-CoV antigen might lead to pulmonary fibrosis in some patients after recovery (Hui et al., 2005) . Das et al. (2015) analysed 55 patients who recovered from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and found that after 1-year, lesions were present in the periphery of the lungs. Even with such a huge mortality rate, there is hope that the COVID-19 patients will recover from this deadly situation.",

In the lungs, the virus-mediated cytokine activation in the alveolar macrophages results in lung fibrosis and damage. In the kidney, activated Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) signalling can cause pyroptosis and cell death. In the heart, this viral infection can rupture the necrotic lipid core forming blood clots resulting in myocardial infarction. In the brain, the olfactory bulb gets infected by SARS-CoV-2, which leads to the inability of smell and might also trigger neurodegenerative diseases in the COVID-19 recovered patients. In the eyes, the tears act as the route of transmission to other organs of the human system through the nasolacrimal system (Qing et al., 2020) . Also, the COVID-19 recovered patients may have psychological stress due to their infection and may be ambiguous about their acceptance in society post infection. Hence, it is essential to conduct the follow-up studies in COVID-19 recovered patients to determine if they have any other detrimental illnesses.",

(2020) have also reported that COVID-19 patients do manifest neurological symptoms such as hyposmia, hypogeusia, hypopsia, and headaches. Unfortunately, if there is any acute, tenacious or dormant form of viral infection inside the CNS, its immune system does not react subsequently, which results in neurological disorders. At this point, the brain damage has yet to be demonstrated as a crucial outcome of the COVID-19 infection. In a recent case report from the USA, a 50-year old woman was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, which also manifested severe neurological symptoms such as acute necrotizing encephalopathy. The neurological report of a woman was confirmed by Computed tomography (CT) scan where the doctors found that there is a bloodbrain barrier vessel leakage in the thalamus which could occur due to viral infection (Poyiadji et al., 2020) . Another report of a 74-year-old man, who was positive for COVID-19, and had a previous medical history of Parkinson's disease and chronic lung disease also displayed neurological symptoms such as inability to speak and seizures (Filatov et al., 2020) .

Individuals who have recovered from the condition may be stigmatized, contributing to psychological issues like depression and anxiety. As the world recuperates from COVID-19, it is essential to move forward with all the information necessary to be more prepared for a pandemic of its kind in the future. It is necessary to conduct the follow-up studies in the COVID-19 recovered patients and provide the appropriate management of this dreadful disease in terms of psychological physical, and social aspects. More research is required to adequately care for patients post recovery and to provide a framework of possible physical manifestations of the disease. As COVID-19 is causing more panic worldwide, it is crucial to get a comprehensive analysis of the post-recovery states of patients. This might also help the social circle of the patients to attain peace, knowing that their friend or family members are no longer contagious or in danger. This may cause anosmia and encephalitis. Upon entry into the eyes, the virus can spread through tear and mediate spreading via nasolacrimal system to other organs of the body and may cause conjunctivitis in the eyes. Entry of virus into the heart through the blood, can cause the formation of a necrotic lipid. When the lipid ruptures it can cause blood clots leading to myocardial infraction. In the kidney, the virus enters the proximal tubules and podocytes via the ACE2 receptors. After entry, it causes deposition of extracellular matrix causing fibrosis, diuresis and proliferation of kidney cells leading to acute kidney injury. In the liver, the virus activates kupffer cells mediating an inflammatory response. This causes activation of the hepatic skellate cells and hepatocytes resulting in pyroptosis and fibrosis derived injury. In the lungs, the virus causes damage to the walls of the alveolar cells, this results in the formation of debris. The debris accumulated in the walls of the alveolar cells causing thickening and results in lung distress and damage. This causes shortness of breath the commonly displayed symptom in COVID-19 (This figure was created by Biorender)",

SARS-CoV-2 is an acute respiratory infection which may have neurotropic capacities which allow the virus to gain dormancy and inhibits immunological reactions in the host cell. Hence, more studies are required to unravel the possible link between COVID-19 and neurological conditions to understand the neuroinvasion properties of the virus and to develop precautionary measures to prevent it.",

            "text": "eyes might have a potent role in the spread of the COVID-19 infection. The eye could also aid as a favourable site for viral replication and routes to the extraocular sites to establish respiratory infection. A recent report suggests that the virus initially enervates the conjunctiva present in the eye, which in turn helps in the spread of the infection to other organs in the human system(Sommer, 2020). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enacts as the functional receptor for the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell. The ACE2 is prominently present in retinal pigment epithelial cells of the retina in the eye; hence the lacrimal system could also perform as the route of transmission of the virus inside the human system.Qing et al., (2020) has stated that tears which get renewed in the lacrimal system could carry the viral droplets and might pass via a nasolacrimal duct to the respiratory tract.The patients who have acquired the SARS-CoV-2 infection might also have ocular related symptoms including conjunctivitis, chemosis, swelling of the conjunctiva, epiphora or overflow of tears onto the face. Further the authors also reported that the COVID-19 patients with symptoms related to eye have haematological abnormalities such as increased levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, prolactin and C-reactive protein when compared with the COVID-19 patients who do not have ocular symptoms. These studies suggest that aside from the nose or mouth, the eyes can also exist as a transmission route for viral spreading.3. SARS-CoV-2 and inflammation in the LungsThe lung has been the major site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Abnormal CT scans have emerged as the first few indicators of infection. Interestingly,Chen et al. (2020) performed the biochemical examination of 99 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and identified the abnormal phenomenon of Hb-related biochemical indexes of patients. It was further confirmed that the Hb and neutrophil counts of most patients have decreased, and the index values of serum ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase of many patients increased significantly. RecentlyCao et al. (2020) conducted the metanalysis, including 31 articles and 46959 patients and uncovered some major lung associated insights into COVID-19. Among the patients, 28.8% of the individuals exhibited ARDS, when the chest CT was considered, 75.5% of them had double pneumonia, while 20.4% exhibited unilateral pneumonia. The frequently occurring abnormalities consisted of ground-glass opacities, which was found in 69.9% of the patients. Irregular lesions were found in 54.4%, thickening of the bronchovascular bundles was seen in 39.5%",

Patients with GI symptoms had increased rates of sore throat, dizziness, fever, headache, fatigue and shortness of breath, showing that GI symptoms may occur at the initial stage of COVID-19. This is conclusive with a study in which a neonate first exhibited GI symptoms, including vomiting and milk refusal (Zhu et al., 2020) before other symptoms of COVID-19 manifested. Viral particles have been isolated from the faecal matter of infected individuals, implicating gastrointestinal conditions in COVID-19 (Tian et al., 2020). According to Zhang et al. (2020), there is a possibility of viral exposure in the liver causing infection in COVID-19 patients (Zhang et al. 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Liver damage can be characterized by a change in levels of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT)",

The COVID-19 has reached a contagion situation, where the coming months would be full of grim updates about the spread of infection and the homecoming of recovered patients. Time of recovery depends on a person's age and pre-existing conditions before the onset of the infection. According to the WHO, people at the age group of 10-50 are likely to get recovered from the disease since the death rate for this age category is well below 1%. The COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized will be back to resume their normal lives after spending weeks breathing with the help of mechanical ventilators. Some of the recovered patients will still have some lingering effects of the virus as well as of the hospital environment. Such situations would J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f make the recovered patients feel paranoid, and the aftermath of the disease would be persistent in the back of their minds. During the quarantine period, the infected, as well as few recovered patients, are devoid from human contact, which might increase the chances of psychological symptoms.
