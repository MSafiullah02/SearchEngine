This can perhaps be attributed to many reasons, such as the unpreparedness to a pandemic at this level, the lack of unified reporting systems due to diversity of health systems across the world, and the novelty of the pandemic itself. Many governments are seeking out forming different strategies that involve mitigating the spread until a method of prevention or a well-defined, and a successful treatment regime is found (Ferguson et al., 2020) . The main focus of such mitigation effects is to alleviate the burden on healthcare systems by spreading out the diffusion of cases over a more extended period of time. While trying to achieve this, governments also face many uncertainties. One such uncertainty involves the absence of proven methods to accurately estimate the potential demand for healthcare services.",

            "text": "While it is now known that the virus affects the elderly population more severely than the youngers, studies often report inconsistent results. Several underlying reasons may explain these inconsistencies. Perhaps one of the most plausible reason is the abundance of undocumented cases. In their study, (Li et al., 2020b) highlight that one of the reasons for the rapid spread of the virus is due to no documentation. They estimate that around 86% of all infections were undocumented. Another study from South Korea suggests similar undocumented case percentages at around 55-86% (Kim et al., 2020) . News also suggests that even mortality cases often go unreported. A recent article in The Economist (Fatal flaws, 2020) highlighted stark differences between the number of expected death cases (including those attributed to COVID-19) and the actual death cases. Their estimation, based on regions' normal death rates, suggests the actual death-toll of the novel COVID-19 being more than double of what is being reported in different regions in Italy, Spain, and France. Perhaps this may be one of the reasons for conflicting CFR and IFR figures reported in the literature. While some studies suggested an estimated case fatality risk of as high as 7.2% (Onder et al., 2020) in Italy, other studies suggested a CFR of 3.4% in China (Wilson et al., 2020) , 2.3% using the age-adjusted Diamond Princess cruise ship data (Russell et al., 2020) . More recent works report somewhat lower case fatality rates circa 1.4-1.5%% (Guan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) , both using data from Wuhan. Similar variations also hold for IFR. Studies report IFRs such as 0.5% using the Diamond Princess cruise ship data (Russell et al., 2020) , 0.94%, and 0.657% using Wuhan data (Famulare, 2020) and (Verity et al., 2020) , respectively. Even though these numbers significantly differ from each other, there seems to be (i) convergence to a CFR of 1.5% over time, (ii) CFR/IFR ratio appears to hover around 2-3, indicating as much as 40-70% asymptomatic cases of the virus.",

            "text": "One of the apparent reasons behind the differences in reported CFRs is the different demographics in different countries. As the virus affects the elderly more than the young, the virus takes a different toll on each country, depending on its age demographics. There may be several other reasons, including the fact that the age distribution of the infected population may differ from the overall age distribution. Hence, 0 may significantly differ across age groups. For instance, a recent report indicated that the death-toll for under 60-year-old patients in Turkey is as much as four times higher than that of the death-rates in other European countries. As Turkey is one of the younger countries, this may be attributed to the demographical differences across countries or even mobility differences across the same age groups in different countries.",
