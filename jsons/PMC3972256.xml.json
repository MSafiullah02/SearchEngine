            "text": "Natural and man-made disasters and public health emergencies are quite common in Ethiopia due to drought, flood, earthquake, volcanic-eruptions, epidemics of communicable diseases, dry and wet mass movement 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Among the natural disasters, drought is the most devastating one since it has been historically common in the northern part of Ethiopia and recently affecting central, eastern, southern parts of the country as well. It has been documented that drought occurred from 1969 to 2011 in different annual intervals affecting millions of people in each event 3 , 5 . Since 1974, the occurrence of drought has become more frequent, severe in magnitude, and has been causing loss of human lives and property damage. The most severe events were in the year 1974, 1983, 1987, 1989, 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2009 2 , 5 ,7 . The population in drought areas are vulnerable because of their reliance on seasonal rain-fall for their livelihood and hence affecting them in myriad ways-ranging from severe malnutrition to deaths and loss of livestock and agricultural related properties. For instance, in 1974 an estimated 200, 000 people died due to drought in the northern part of the country 3 , since then the short and long-term effects of drought have been persisting in various forms including severe acute and chronic malnutrition, and associated morbidities and mortalities due to measles, respiratory infections (mainly pneumonia), diarrhea and dysentery. In 1985/86, a study conducted in Borana (southern part of Ethiopia), which is one of the drought prone areas, revealed that high level of malnutrition and wasting was associated with child mortality 8\n. In the same year (in February 1985), another study was conducted in emergency camps of Ethiopian drought refugees in Sudan reported that a crude mortality rate of 8.9 per 10, 000 per day, and the mortality had been the highest among children under five years of age (22 per 10, 000 per day) 9 . On the other hand, a study carried out from December 1999 to July 2000 in Somali region of Ethiopia, another prominent drought affected area, reported a crude mortality rate of 3.2 per 10000 per day (with 95% Confidence Interval/CI 2.4-3.8/10000 per day) among children 6 months to 14 years of age 10 . Following the 2003 drought, the vulnerable people were resettled in various parts of the country under resettlement programs. For example, from the eastern Hararge (eastern part of Ethiopia) vulnerable people were made to resettle in the western part of the country. A nutritional survey was carried out in 2004 among the resettled and vulnerable population in western part of Ethiopia. According to this survey, prevalence of global acute malnutrition was 9.8% (95% CI 7.1-12.5), prevalence of severe acute malnutrition was 1.93% (95% CI 0.68-3.18%), and the under-five mortality rate was 2.65 per 10,000 per day 11 . As can be analyzed from the above studies, the mortality rates had been by far higher than the threshold set for declaring an emergency for each age-specific category of mortality and children under-five years have been found to be the most vulnerable and victims of drought. Though timing in any survey is very important in order to objectively establish the association of malnutrition and drought, national surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) demonstrate high levels of wasting and stunting among children. For example according to DHS conducted in 2011, 10% and 44 % of children had been wasted and stunted, respectively 12 . Hence, drought has been the leading disaster in Ethiopia besides other emerging and frequent hazards.",

To coordinate the relief and rehabilitation efforts during the event, Ethiopian government established Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC). Its main responsibilities were to mobilize resources from national and international sources and organize human power to deploy to the affected areas. This drought did not only lead to establishment of RRC but also triggered the down fall of the government of Haileslaise and reinstatement of military junta (the Derg regime) 3 ,4 .

            "text": "The mandate of established RRC was limited to coordination of relief. Till 1989 it had not transformed itself to an agency that could implement disaster prevention and preparedness programs. Due to absence of adequate preparedness measures, a number of human lives were lost even in the two severe droughts of 1983/1984 and 1989 which could have been avoided 4 ,19 ,20 . During those droughts, the measures undertaken were to appeal for international aid, relief programs such as provision of food and medical services to the affected people, and resettlement of affected population to other regions within the country 3 ,21 ,22 . As some of these actions were unplanned, the health conditions of famine affected people were further exacerbated due to reactive response to disaster. For example, the resettlement action was taken without preparation and the disease outbreaks among the settlers were higher than the local people, and health services were inadequately accessed by the resettled people in various regions 23 . Moreover, responses to disaster were not timely during the 1983/1984 drought, like the former one where government failed to readily admit and declare the existence of drought in the country since the government was at war with rebels 3 . It was the international media that uncovered the situation in the country 22 and some aid agencies or individual donors decided to channel the fund through rebels so as to support the affected population in the rebel held area. However, there was an allegation that instead the rebels diverted some aid to purchase weapons. This attests to the ineffective relief coordination and aid due to absence of strong preventive and preparedness system in place 21 ,22 . In this period and afterwards, there was lack of vital \u201clifesaving emergency health interventions\u201d such as treatment and prevention of measles, malaria treatment and provision of pure water supply 24 . Furthermore, some of the preparedness initiatives such as the early warning system though had started before 1977, they were criticized for being ineffective for a number of reasons. Firstly, the early warning system was centralized and involvement of the local government and community was limited. Second, the indicators used had been only addressing the food security and rainfall status, while overlooking the comprehensive dimension that purported to include such as malnutrition and diseases outbreaks status in the community. Third, the early warning system as a whole failed to give the necessary information before the occurrence of drought of 1983/84 and 1989/2000 25 . While the initially used early warning system helped for the subsequent development of relatively comprehensive and informative early warning system for the drought, the other hazards were not incorporated and there was no other preparedness measure being under taken for any other hazard or disaster both at policy level and in practice till 1989. Hence, the year between 1974 and 1989 marked different events of severe drought disasters that claimed thousands of lives due to lack of effective preventive, preparedness, and mitigation programs within disaster management system of the country.",

Among these changes was the early warning system and assessment tool developed in 1977 being modified through time in order to make it serve the intended purpose 25 . The previous early warning system was focusing on the food security, rainfall, and water availability status; however, the modified one was made to be relatively more comprehensive by including the nutritional status of the vulnerable groups of population such as children under-five years and pregnant women in disaster prone areas 25 , 29 . This early warning system is being conducted on monthly and quarterly basis and reports are transferred from the community to the federal Disaster Risk Reduction and Food Security Sector, which could enable timely action 30 . The other measures taken as part of preparedness and preventive phase of disaster risk management is ensuring the food availability at government stock and timely appeal and request for further aid 31 ,32 . In addition, beginning from year 2000 in all drought prone districts, periodic community based nutritional screening started and the outpatient therapeutic feeding programs were initiated in all health stations (replaced by health posts since 2003) and health centers so as to manage uncomplicated malnutrition cases at the outpatient level 24 ,33 ,34 . Furthermore, at health centers and hospitals, therapeutic feeding units were opened so as to treat severe and complicated malnutrition cases using the national guideline and treatment protocols 34 . There have been other interventions undertaken by the government of Ethiopia in order to mitigate drought disaster; these interventions are designing and implementing irrigation schemes in drought areas 35 . Creation of employment opportunities to reduce vulnerability in their localities of those drought affected areas as part and parcel of mainstreaming the risk management interventions into the long term development programs are also undertaken 27 . On the other hand, the health sector implemented a clear surveillance system to control the outbreaks and respond on time to any emergency. Particular emphasis was put on the drought and malnutrition stricken areas due to the fact that in most instances malnutrition has been followed by the outbreaks of diseases 1 ,33 . Looking at other hazards apart from drought and diseases epidemics, since 2006 following the floods disaster across many parts of the country an early warning system for flood has begun in collaboration with the metrological agency and information is being conveyed to the inhabitants of the flood areas using mass-media and the disaster risk reduction and food security sector has been activating itself for effective preparedness and response to disaster 36 . In general, since changing the policy on disaster risk management although drought and disease epidemic disasters are happening more frequently, the number of deaths have been reduced dramatically compared with the early periods of disasters (1974, 1984, 1989). This could be due to the lesson learned from the previous disasters and effective preparedness and response actions under taken by the government and partners.",

Lack of multi-hazard approach policy and strategy is one of the major weaknesses, as stated by the government recently. Cognizant of the challenge, at policy and strategy level this appears to be addressed in general terms 28 . However, still there is no clear and specific policy and strategy pertaining to these hazards apart from drought and when any disaster happens, the intervention being directed by government and partners is \u201creactive\u201d than \u201cpro-active\u201d.

The initial screening of patients done at emergency department and if any emergency surgery is needed, patients would be transferred to the respective department for surgical procedure or for advanced level of care. Basing on limited available evidence, there is no triage system in the emergency departments; and there is no out-of hospital emergency management system in Ethiopian health care system. During night time only one general practitioner and one nurse or \u201chealth assistance\u201d would be assigned in the emergency department, and managing emergency cases as a result of mass causality during night could be very problematic. Moreover, the training of emergency medicine has been reported to be non-standardized in the country. There is no specific emergency medicine course in the training curricula of medical schools in Ethiopia; and the skills and knowledge of emergency medicine among health professionals in Ethiopia could not enable them to manage emergencies arising from natural and man-made disasters, particularly those causing huge number of injuries. 42 To fill such gap, some initiatives have been taken by the ministry of health and non-governmental organizations or partners. For instance, the Israeli government has supported the Ethiopian Ministry of Health in training of physicians in emergency medicine 42 ; Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) though its main operational mandate in Ethiopia is responding to emergency during outbreaks of diseases or disaster, it has taken initiatives to strengthen the hospitals\u2019 capacity through training of general practitioners in emergency surgery 43 . The Ethiopian federal ministry of health in collaboration with ministry of education began offering Integrated Emergency Surgery Officer (IESO) training at masters level (three years training in integrated emergency surgery) beginning from 2009. By the end of 2011, totally 252 health officers (BSC holders with clinical and public health training) were enrolled for this program in five public universities 44 . This program has been initiated to increase the trained human resource in emergency surgery at hospitals and health centers. Though this program has not been directly related to emergency management arising from disasters, it has a significant contribution in building the public health facilities with trained man power in the area of emergency.",

            "text": "Similar to the disaster risk management system of Ethiopia, the health system\u2019s response to emergencies arising from disasters came into being with series of drought disaster events in the country. Thus, reforms of disaster risk management policies and strategies in Ethiopia have paved the way for the involvement of the health sector in all phases of disaster management. Initially with the former RRC, the health sector role was not clearly stated and through time as a result of experience gained from responding to disasters, participation of all concerned sectors and preparedness for disaster was necessitated and included in subsequent reforms of policies and strategies 19 ,20 . Change in policies and strategies of disaster risk management enabled health system to take some initiatives and develop its own guidelines and strategies of preparedness for emergencies and response to disasters 1 ,34 . One of those initiatives being under taken under the leadership of Ethiopian ministry of health is the \u201cCommunity Based Nutrition\u201d in drought affected areas. Nutritional assessment among children under-two years is regularly undertaken and malnutrition suspected cases are referred to health facilities and health posts 33 . The second program that was adopted due to drought and malnutrition is therapeutic feeding program. In drought prone areas, ministry of health of Ethiopia in partnership with UNICEF and other International Non-governmental Organizations (INGOs) established an outpatient therapeutic feeding program at health posts (community based), at health centers and hospitals. While the management of malnutrition at the health posts level is limited to severe and uncomplicated cases, at health centers and hospitals the therapeutic feeding units have been established to manage severe and complicated malnutrition cases 34 . At health posts, which are the lowest level health units operating close to the community, severe and uncomplicated malnutrition cases are managed at outpatient department level and if cases failed to respond to treatments given, they would be referred to health centers. In addition, health posts have duty- bound responsibility to refer the severe complicated malnutrition cases to health centers and notify health centers any malnutrition and its associated outbreaks existence in their respective localities. At health centers and hospitals, besides the management of malnutrition patients at outpatient department level, they manage severe complicated cases by admitting to the therapeutic feeding units. Overall, using a national guideline, malnutrition cases from moderate to severe-complicated cases are being managed at different levels of health facilities and at the community level (health posts). The expansion of the therapeutic feeding program to different health facilities and health posts and to different regions or areas were step by step. At early stages of implementation of the program, its effectiveness could be below the expected level due lack of experience and trained manpower. For instance, in 2006 a qualitative study conducted in Borana drought and emergency (southern part of Ethiopia) and it pointed out that the health facilities were unprepared in terms of human power and therapeutic feeding items, and the surveillance system was not well functioning in order to respond to the emergency in the area 45 .",

            "text": "Responding to disease outbreaks or epidemics is one of the responsibilities of the health system in Ethiopia. As part of the routine surveillance system, federal Ethiopian ministry of health has adopted World Health Organization\u2019s strategy of surveillance system for developing countries, commonly known as \u201cintegrated surveillance system\u201d. However, in 2012 the national guideline was prepared to make the health sectors approach in responding to disaster and emergency a \u201cmulti-hazards risk management approach\u201d. This guideline states that besides responding to natural and man-made disasters, 20 selected diseases that are considered as of public health importance to be under routine surveillance system. Of these 20 diseases, 13 of them are required to be reported immediately while 7 of them should be notified every week 1\n. Some of these diseases included here such as measles, meningococcal meningitis, malaria, dysentery, cholera, and severe malnutrition are secondary to drought and floods disaster events. The existence of one case of polio, anthrax, cholera, avian human influenza, guinea worm or dracunculiasis, neonatal tetanus, pandemic influenza, rabies, smallpox, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), viral hemorrhagic fever, and yellow fever are considered and handled as epidemic and their reporting from any health facility need to be done immediately. Diseases such as dysentery, malaria, meningococcal meningitis, relapsing fever, severe malnutrition, typhoid fever and typhus are reported on weekly basis, and declaring of epidemic for these diseases is based on the prior level of disease burden in a specific location 1 ,16 ,33 . Thus, when any epidemic is declared for a particular disease, the health system responds as an emergency health situation. Overall, the epidemic control system seems improving from year to year. However, in some cases the diseases status looks stable with little change. For instance, the average national case fatality rate of measles of 2011 was 0.5%, for 2013 was 0.4% and the average national case fatality rate of meningococcal meningitis for the year ending 2011 was 2.9%, and while for the year ending 2013 it was 2.5% 16 ,48 . In the year 2013 in the southern part of Ethiopia in two regions (Oromia and Southern Nations and Nationalities/SNNP), meningococcal meningitis outbreak was reported, control and preventive measures were taken by the government in collaboration with non-governmental organizations 16 .",

Hence, there is little evidence of change in practice of the health sector in averting these hazards, apart from the declaration of policy. For example, in 2008 a study conducted in western part of Ethiopia in flood prone area revealed that the health facilities were unprepared for flooding and training was not given to health professionals; an early warning was not given to vulnerable residents in the area; materials necessary for emergency such as boats and life jackets were unavailable; there were no trained swimmers; and disaster prevention and preparedness agency in the area had no medicines to respond to epidemics after flooding 15 .",

Several INGOs began operating in Ethiopia in 1974 drought in order to respond to the then catastrophic humanitarian situation of northern part of the country. Ever since then, the roles and operational geographical areas of INGOs have been determined by the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission, which has been recently changed and called Disaster Risk management and Food Security Sector 50 . Therefore, Ethiopia\u2019s health system has been benefiting a lot from foreign aid/donors and INGOs in terms of direct financial support for financing the health care system 50 ,51 ,52 ; technical support in policy, strategy formulations, evaluation of emergency responses 1 ,20 ,27 ,53 ; training of human power in epidemic control and emergency response 42 ,43 ,50 ,54 ,55 ; and capacity building of health facilities with medical supplies, essential drugs and supplies mainly for malnutrition, measles, meningococcal meningitis, malaria, dysentery, and other common childhood and neonatal illnesses 56 ,57 ,58 . Its worth mentioning that, INGOs have been highly involved in designing the national malnutrition management protocol, and initiating the therapeutic feeding programs in drought prone areas of health facilities and posts. INGOs and UN agencies have a paramount importance role in assisting the ministry of health technically and financially in training of health workers in malnutrition management at outpatient departments and inpatient therapeutic feeding units, Integrated Management of Neonatal and Child-hood Illnesses (IMNCI), and surveillance system and responding to emergencies in the country 34 ,58 . This support is rendered through the government system to ensure sustainability of the program and integration of new initiatives into the health system. However, when a disaster situation and emergency is severe and appears to be overwhelming the health system, the INGOs are called on by the government to offer emergency medical services (to act even out of their normal operational areas) 24 . At the field level, they implement \u201cemergency relief programmes\u201d till the situation of epidemics become under control 46 . For example, when the severe drought occurred in Borana zone of Oromia region (southern Ethiopia) in 1984, and in Gode district of Somali region in 2000, INGOs were made to directly support the government health system at field level in responding to widespread cases of malnutrition and measles outbreaks 8 ,10 . Overall, INGOs and donors are playing a crucial role in the containment of emergencies due to drought disaster and outbreaks of diseases. However, as indicated previously INGOs and their practical roles in supporting the health system are minimal with regard to floods, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, man-made and other hazards.",

Since the recent years, due to the widespread existence of natural and man-made disasters in the country, the public health emergency guideline 1 has been developed and risk assessment, multi-hazard approach, participation of all sectors and INGOs are considered as the corner stone priority approach of the health sector toward disaster and disaster risk management. However, apart from the drought and disease epidemics little evidence exists in proving whether lessons learnt were put into practice.",

Firstly, the disaster risk management system of Ethiopia that used to focus on response and recovery, transformed itself to include mitigation, prevention, preparedness components, and currently the system is comprehensive, particularly for drought 27 ,28 . Secondly, as the task of disaster management requires multisectorial approach, all line ministries including ministry of health have been involved from federal to the district level and other partners like non-governmental organizations are part of policy formulation and implementation 27 . Thirdly, some emergency programs such as the malnutrition have a clear guideline to be implemented at all levels of health facilities and at the community level in drought prone areas 34 . Fourth, for drought the government has linked the program with the other development programs in order to tackle the challenge in the long term 27 . Finally, apart from collaborating with Disaster Risk Management and Food Security Sector for all natural and man-made disasters, the ministry of health recently developed a guideline for the management of public health emergencies and 20 diseases have been identified to be under surveillance at all levels of health care system and at community level 1 ,16 ,33 . Hence, these are the major strengths of the disaster management system within the Ethiopian health sector.",

The health care system of Ethiopia also evolved over time from curative centered approach to preventive, and the current health care system has three layers that include primary health care unit, general and specialized hospitals from bottom to top, respectively. The health sector has taken initiatives for management of disasters related to drought and its impacts in collaboration with Disaster Risk Management and Food Security Sector. In addition, the ministry of health has developed a guideline by which it manages the public health epidemics and 20 diseases have been identified to be under regular surveillance.
