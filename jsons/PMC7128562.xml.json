A very small number of adult purebred-appearing cats were present in the population (3 Persian and 1 Russian Blue). Accurate ages were obtained for only a portion of the cats. Eighty-six cats were classified as adults, eight as juvenile, and 12 as kittens, with 56 cats not having any age noted.",

This age pattern was also typical of what has been previously reported for cats from high density environments; 37.3% of English show cats less than 12 months of age were shedding FCV compared to 17% of older cats (Couts et al., 1994). The 15% FCV shedding rate among cats kept in shelters for a week or more was also similar to the 24\u201325% shedding rates described for high-risk cats in England (Couts et al., 1994; Wardley et al., 1974). FCV is an infection mainly of young kittens (Pedersen, 1988a).

Most acute FHV disease is seen in the post-weaning period (Pedersen, 1988b). Therefore, it was not surprising to observe the highest FHV shedding rate in juveniles and the lowest in young adults and kittens. The rapid increase in virus shedding, from 4 to 52% after 1 week in the shelter, was much higher than anticipated. FHV is very efficiently spread from cat-to-cat and every cat that has been previously infected is a potential latent carrier (Hickman et al., 1994). Stresses as simple as moving a cat into a new environment can convert latent to active infections in a few days (Gaskell and Povey, 1977; Hickman et al., 1994). Therefore, it was not possible to determine how much of the increased rate of FHV shedding during the first week in the shelter was due to virus exposure and how much to activation of pre-existing latent infections. The marked increase in virus shedding after only 1 week clearly demonstrates why FHV is one of the most important causes of disease in shelter environments.",

Outdoor cats tend to bury their feces in distinct territories, thus limiting fecal\u2013oral contact. However, the cats that were being relinquished to the shelters and included in this study were not feral in behavior. They also tended to come from urban areas, where the density of outdoor cats is high. These factors often lead to the common use of gardens, sand boxes, etc. FECV is relatively stable, lasting up to 7 days in the environment. FECV is somewhat unique because immunity is not long-lasting and re-infections are common (reviewed by Pedersen, 1995). About one in ten infected cats will persistently shed the virus, eight in ten will undergo repeated re-infections, and one in ten will develop solid immunity (Foleyet al., 1997a). Two cats that appeared to be immune to FECV were observed in the present study. These animals remained non-infected even after 2 weeks of stress and exposure.",

Therefore, shelters are not the ultimate source of these particular viruses, but the shelter environment appears to amplify and efficiently spread these agents and enhance clinical disease. The impact of infection by FCV, FHV and FECV can have immediate and long-term consequences to a shelter, depending on the relative importance of acute and chronic disease manifestations. Acute disease is the most obvious problem for shelters, while chronic disease is largely a problem for cats that have been adopted into homes. Acute FCV disease may not be as great of a problem in shelters in this area as believed, because most cats have been exposed to FCV prior to relinquishment and the virus can persist in the face of routine immunization (Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995). Furthermore, acute FCV disease tends to be mild or inapparent in nature, even in similar high cat density environments (Johnson, 1984). However, under certain conditions, FCV infection can greatly increase the mortality to feline panleukopenia (FPV) virus infection (Bittle et al., 1961), and we have also observed that many shelter cats dying of panleukopenia are coinfected with FCV. FCV can infrequently mutate or recombine with other strains in the shelter milieu to produce a highly virulent virus associated with outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic fever (Pedersen et al., 2000). The most important clinical manifestation of FCV infection is probably chronic ulceroproliferative faucitis, a progressive disease that occurs in some FCV carriers (Reubelet al., 1992). This disease is a major cause of euthanasia.",

Although only 4% of cats entering the shelter are shedders, over one-half of them will shed FHV within the next week. The shelter environment is ideal for reactivation of latent infections, spread of the virus from cat-to-cat, and for enhancing the severity of disease signs through stress and increased exposure. Acute FHV infection is probably the single leading cause for shelter cats to be destroyed or to receive veterinary care. As bad as acute FHV infection is in shelters, there are also serious chronic sequelae to the infection that must be borne by recovered cats. Long term effects of acute FHV disease include scarring of the nasolacrimal and chronic epiphora, persistence of replicating virus in the nerves of the cornea and indolent ulcers, and chronic scarring and atrophy of the nasal mucosa and turbinates resulting in chronic rhinosinusitis (Pedersen, 1988b).",

            "text": "The acute stage of FECV infection is of little consequence. Except for the unusual cat with an acute gastroenteritis, the infection is largely asymptomatic (Pedersen, 1995). However, during bouts of virus replication in the gut, macrophage\u2013tropic mutants are frequently generated (Polandet al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998). Some of these mutant viruses leave the gut and are carried systemically by their macrophage hosts. Such mutant viruses cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that ultimately kills upwards of 5% of shelter kittens (Pedersen, 1995). Anything that increases virus replication in the gut will increase the likelihood of this mutation to occur (Poland et al., 1996). Young kittens, which are at greatest risk, produce the highest amounts of virus. Most kittens less than 8 weeks of age coming into shelters have not been exposed to FECV, but virtually all are shedding after 1 week. The amount of virus replication is also enhanced ten to a million fold by the mere fact of being placed in a shelter, an environmental influence that is probably similar to that which increases FHV shedding. It is not surprising; therefore, that FIP is one of the most important diseases of cats coming from shelter environments.",

FCV is brought in mainly by young kittens, whereas FECV and FHV are more apt to be introduced by older kittens and juveniles. Although shelters are not the primary source of these viruses, the shelter environment serves to spread the viruses between infected and non-infected individuals and to amplify shedding, in particular for FHV and FECV. The proportion of cats shedding FHV can go up over ten-fold in 1 week, while the incidence of FECV shedders will almost double. Factors intrinsic to the sheltering experience appear to increase FECV shedding from 10- to 1,000,000-fold after 1 week. Similar factors probably account for the dramatic increase in FHV shedding. Feline calicivirus infection is least affected by the shelter experience, probably because most cats have already been exposed prior to relinquishment.",
