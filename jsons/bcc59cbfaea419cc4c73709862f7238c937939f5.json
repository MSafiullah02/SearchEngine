In 1914, Bethune suspended his medical studies and joined the Canadian Army's No. 2 Field Ambulance to serve as a stretcher-bearer in France. He was wounded by shrapnel, and after recovering, he returned to Toronto to complete his medical degree. Based on his experience in WWI, he organized a mobile transfusion service stating: \"Why bring the bleeding men back to the hospital when the blood should travel forward to them?\" During the Spanish Civil War, 28,900 donors donated 9000 liters of whole blood. Donors are X-rayed for TB and their blood is tested for syphilis and malaria. Six donations of whole blood were mixed and filtered and then placed in 300 ml glass jars and stored at 2 \u00b0C for up to 15 days. With the advent of blood fractionation, plasma could be separated from whole blood and was used for the first time in this war to treat the battle wounded. In 1938, Duran-Jorda fleed to the United Kingdom and worked with Dr. Janet Vaughan at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital to create a system of national blood banks in London.",

The presence of anti-A and B antibodies from type O whole blood, however, sometimes made it impossible to crossmatch the patient. Severe reactions sometimes occurred when type-specific whole blood was given after large transfusions of low-titer O whole blood. In the light of this new observation, it was recommended that after transfusions of low-titer group O whole blood, no change should be made to blood of another group until at least 2 weeks had elapsed from the last group O whole blood transfusion [40] .",

There was some evidence obtained from use of Swedish and British dextran that showed local and systemic allergic reactions; this was thought to be worse with the higher molecular weight dextran and the US-produced dextran of lower molecular weights.

A 6-month study had been started in Air Force installations in the United States. Dextran was used in increasing amounts until the end of the Korean War.

This combination of oxygen debt-driven endothelial damage and ATC might be considered collectively as \"blood failure.\" The article presents the implications of oxygen debt remote damage control resuscitation strategies, such as permissive hypotension and hemostatic resuscitation [70, 71] .",

Somalia Use of Fresh Whole Blood in Mogadishu Experience and How It Affected Iraq/Afghanistan Wars In 1993, the US forces in Mogadishu Somalia were faced with a shark attack victim from the tenth Mountain Division who required bilateral lower extremity amputations and massive transfusion. With limited plasma and infrequent resupply of packed red blood cells, Colonel Denver Perkins initiated an emergency donor panel whole blood collection. The immediate resolution of clinical coagulopathy and improved physiology was apparent to all. This highlighted the efficacy of whole blood and led to around 120 units of whole blood collected and more than 80 units being transfused during the Black Hawk Down crisis. This event led to the inclusion of whole blood training for deploying forward surgical teams at the joint trauma training center starting in 1999 with a section on whole blood in the 2003 version of Emergency War Surgery handbook (personal communication, JB Holcomb).",
