Crowd-sourcing can provide important support for decision making [55], including under time pressures associated with crises. Crowd-sourcing and expertsourcing can be effective in managing community engagements and interactions [58], particularly under uncertain conditions. This paper argues the advent of crowd-sourcing and social media technology may support a new era in knowledge management, offering important advances in the development of disaster management theory, and extends theory relating to post normal science [22], Kuhn's notions of \u2018normal\u2019 science [34] and Lakatos's consideration of theoretical resistance to change [35] to provide new perspectives of theory development in disaster risk reduction.",

The rise of crowd-sourcing [30], defined here as sourcing inputs or resources from the \u2018crowd\u2019 or from an open call to the public, potentially heralds a new paradigm in problem solving; as problem solving data inputs can now be obtained from the general population, or the crowd, on a scale hitherto unimagined. Crowdsourced research and development (R&D) relates specifically to crowd-sourcing which seeks to source information for problem solving research purposes, and expertsourcing is crowd-sourcing for inputs from experts, a form of crowdsourced R&D. Crowdfunding is crowd-sourcing applied to raise funding. A new stream of literature with a focus on real time problem solving, namely \u2018probabilistic innovation\u2019 [10] suggests that by exponentially increasing volumes of problem solving research inputs (expert and non-expert) from millions (in the \u2018crowd\u2019), radical acceleration of medical research can be enabled, and research yield timelines can be \u2018crashed,\u2019 thus radically accelerating the pace of scientific research. This developing stream of literature, extended to disaster management, arguably offers useful insights for those seeking to build theory around increasing effectiveness of real time crisis management.",

The field of disaster management may be an important \u2018development ground\u2019 for important research into how real time capacity can be attained, and the application of real time probabilistic innovation in the form of crowdsourced R&D [10] to crisis disasters is therefore crucially important. A useful heuristic, then, is the example of such a disaster in the form of a disease outbreak, or pandemic, in which the data needed for research to solve this problem are only available after the start of the outbreak. Disaster management is therefore taken to be an important context for research into how to develop probabilistic innovation theory for the following reasons.",

A core assumption underlying this notion, however, is that exponential increases in crowd inputs can transmit to useful outputs [10]. Given effectiveness of probabilistic innovation hinges on this assumption, knowledge of how to operationalise probabilistic innovation is however lacking, and research has a long way to go before radical acceleration of time scales in \u2018conventional\u2019 medical research (such as research into cancer, diabetes or ageing) becomes a reality. Hence, the extreme conditions of disasters can provide a useful testing ground for theory relating crowdsourced R&D and social media technologies contributions to data collection, integration and analysis, as the potential value contributions of probabilistic innovation are more immediately evident and clear under disaster conditions. Process innovations associated with probabilistic innovation are taken to derive from management theory generally, and knowledge management theory more specifically.",

Given the potential loss of life and consequences of a lack of knowledge relating to how to enable real-time disaster management research, not undertaking this and similar research into probabilistic innovation would arguably be problematic.

Taking complexity theory as a reference frame for disaster management (DM) is useful as it provides insights into interactions between system components and systems and their larger environments; particularly over the course of a disaster, as constituent phases have different objectives and unique complexity [43]. Specific disasters are the \u201cproduct of complex conditions, in both the environmental and social realms\u201d and response dependent on complex interactions of institutional response and environmental conditions [25]. Closely related to complexity theory applied to disaster management is the need to manage information and knowledge in contexts of extreme complexity, and the need to understand causal mechanisms and channels as well as to develop theory that guides the management of knowledge inputs under extreme conditions.",

Statistical models have been used to model risk and variability, for example in cases of tornado risk [47], reflecting an increasing trend toward modelling information in crisis response. This process of modelling different dimensions of crisis and response, however, is dependent on both volume and quality of data collection and analysis. Mapping of hard and soft system infrastructure, at both the micro and macro levels, and developing models of these relationships is important, yet has typically been under-researched [43].

The need for global outbreak response networks is increasingly salient in a context of potential species crossovers. At the human-animal interface (HAI), influenza viruses such as avian virus subtypes H5N1, and H9N2, and swine virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have emerged, highlighting the potential threats of pandemics that arise from species crossovers [57]. The core thesis of this paper is that given the potential consequences of catastrophic disasters, there are consequences associated with not developing focus on disaster research theory and best practice drawing on the principles of probabilistic innovation. Arguably, the congestion, complexity and uncertainties of disaster knowledge management require high volume idea inputs to solve problems in addition to knowledge and information inputs, and developing the field of probabilistic innovation with a special focus on managing these inputs in a way akin to \u2018high volume air traffic control\u2019 might ultimately offer the hope of real time research problem solving. Radical acceleration of biomedical research and other social problem solving research, including climate change and other disaster management applications may be possible if crowdsourced R&D lives up to the promise suggested by probabilistic innovation theory.",

According to the first paradigm, namely the real time response paradigm, problems need to be solved in real time, as problems are time-critical. This paradigm is considered to potentially benefit from theory development related to post normal science theory [22], which seeks to spread the scientific validation process across populations, and work in the citizen science area [4] drawing also from participant-led research [54], which can offer principles useful for real time disaster management based on how populations can help not only to provide large-scale quality data in crises but also how they can contribute to analysis of data and problem solving in real time.",

This process naturally fits with real time disaster management, as in certain crises an enormous amount of data needs to be sourced, managed, and subjected to an integrated analysis in an instantaneous process.

It is this need that probabilistic innovation theory and its methodology of crowdsourced R&D seeks to address. Another argument was also made, namely in order to radically accelerate socially important research, it is important to develop a field of research developing theory from experience of extreme disaster contexts as this can develop real time research data collection, synthesis and analysis capabilities. To do this, it is perhaps necessary to develop crowdsourced R&D capacity, harnessing data and information capabilities of social media, which in turn captures productivity enhancements associated with recent technology advances, allowing high volumes of expert problem solving inputs to be focused on solving crisis disaster management problems as well as a host of other research problems in real time.
