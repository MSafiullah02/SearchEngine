Two cases of retinal degeneration after in utero exposure to chloroquine were published in 1969 [7] and 1 case of ocular abnormality in 2011 [8] in a child exposed prenatally to methotrexate and chloroquine. Two reviews of 12 and 9 studies [7, 9] including respectively 588 and 246 children did not highlight an increased risk of eye abnormalities in children exposed in utero to the two medications of interest. However, the authors of the reviews underlined the insufficiency of data, the presence of numerous biases and the need to follow up the children over a longer period. The ocular toxicity of these 2 drugs is dependent on the \"dose\" and the \"duration of use\" [10] . Considering the half-lives of these drugs, one cannot exclude, in case of a long exposure, their accumulation, favouring adverse effects on the retina.",

These drugs can induce adverse effects, on the eyes (and a rare risk for the foetus cannot be entirely ruled out), but also on the heart rhythm (they are quinidine derivatives) that must increase our vigilance.
