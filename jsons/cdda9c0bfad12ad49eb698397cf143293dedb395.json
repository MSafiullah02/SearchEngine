In the setting of the recent pandemic, there is a greater need to perform tracheostomy for these patients. With the high transmissibility of the virus, there has been an increasing concern for the development of techniques to perform surgical intervention while mitigating the risk for infecting hospital staff. As more data emerge pertaining to viral shedding in various bodily fluids, it has become more important to give special attention to precautions. In this article, we submit a novel approach for better protection and thus reduced transmission for tracheostomy in a COVID-19 positive patient. Importantly, this technique is functional, easy to set up, and can be used for additional operations that involve risk of aerosolization or droplet exposure to operating room staff.",

The severity of the disease ranges broadly between a mild cough to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, whereby some patients require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Its predilection for high transmissibility is threefold as the virus can be spread via contact, droplets, and aerosol. 1 This presents particular challenges for the healthcare team providing surgical intervention, especially tracheostomy, while mitigating the risk for increasing the spread of the disease.",

The COVID-19 pandemic will soon present a new problem; prolonged ventilation and the need for tracheostomy. At our institution, we have yet to be forced to use these procedures to free up resources (including ventilators), and recommend they be performed in a controlled and safe environment to minimize transmission to providers. This protocol has been used on 1 patient who over 28 days of intubation, had improved ventilator settings and had an opportunity of recovery. Before the implementation of this protocol, we conducted numerous dry runs with special attention to the mechanics, ease of use and set-up, and visibility of surgical site. Importantly, it was noted that if there is any malfunction regarding the overlying clear drape, simple removal of the drape can be done without re-draping or further complication to the operation. Ultimately, this protocol allows the hospital staff to minimize the risk and exposure of the virus to the hospital staff.",
