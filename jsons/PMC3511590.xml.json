TIB patterns, in particular, usually represent the disease of the small airways such as infectious-inflammatory bronchiolitis as well as bronchiolar luminal impaction with mucus, pus, cells, or fluid causing normally invisible peripheral airways to become visible on CT [7]. Fig. 1 shows typical TIB patterns in a chest CT (Fig. 1 shows labeled TIB patterns with blue). As its name implies, this pattern resembles a budding tree in CT due to the branching opacities with adjacent centrilobular nodularity [2]. It is not specific for a single disease entity, but suggests pathology in the peripheral airways, which can be associated with air trapping or subsegmental consolidation in the surrounding alveolar airspaces. Because any organism that infects the small airways can cause a TIB pattern, pulmonary infections are its most common cause.\n",

This process comes from a learning perspective such that the size, shape, and textural characteristics of TIB patterns are learned a priori. The candidate selection process removes large homogeneous regions from consideration which results in a rapid localization of candidate TIB patterns. The local regions enclosing candidate TIB patterns are then used to extract shape and texture features for automatic detection; 2) another novel aspect in this study is to extract M\u00f6bius invariant local shape features (i.e., Willmore energy-based features). Extracted local shape features are combined with statistical texture features to classify lung tissues. In addition, we also investigate the extraction and use of different local shape features as compared to the proposed shape features to facilitate local structure analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses automatic detection of TIB patterns for a CAD system in infectious lung diseases. Since there is no published work on automatic detection of TIB patterns in the literature, we compare our proposed CAD system on the basis of different feature sets previously shown to be successful in detecting lung diseases in general. Early version of this study appeared in [3], and can be accessed in [8].",

In this study, fuzzy connectedness (FC) image segmentation algorithm is used to achieve successful delineations [9]. In FC framework, as illustrated in Fig. 3, left and right lungs are \u201crecognized\u201d by user-defined or automatically assigned seeds, which initiate FC segmentation. In this study, one seed per lung volume (i.e., left or right) is automatically set by only considering the locations of small intensity valued voxels inside the body region (see [9] for a detailed description of the use of FC in anatomy segmentation). Fig. 3 (middle and right) shows the resulting segmentation of the chest CT given on the left. Although we use FC algorithm to segment lung regions, there are many well-established lung segmentation methods in the literature [9]\u2013[11], [29], and [41] such that they could possibly be used as well to accomplish the delineation step. In that sense, we do not have any strict restriction on the choice of segmentation algorithm prior to detection system as long as it successfully segments the lung regions.\n",

Together with the fact that TIB pattern has a complex shape with varying intensities over discontinues branches (i.e., buds), TIB patterns have intensity characteristics with high variation toward nearby voxels (see Fig. 1). In other words, TIB patterns do not constitute sufficiently large homogeneous regions. Thus, TIB patterns are localized only in the vicinity of small homogeneous regions, and their boundaries have high curvatures due to the nature of its complex shape. In the next section, we use these two observations to extract novel characteristic features to detect TIB patterns.",

            "text": "Our candidate selection method comes from a learning perspective such that we assign every internal voxel of the lung a membership value reflecting the size (i.e., scale) of the homogeneous region that the voxel belongs to. To do this, we use a locally adaptive scale-based filtering method called ball-scale (or b-scale for short) [9], [16], [17]. The b-scale is the simplest form of a locally adaptive scale where the scene is partitioned into several scale levels. Every voxel in each scale is assigned the size of the local structure it belongs. For instance, voxels within the large homogeneous objects have highest scale values, and the voxels nearby the boundary of objects have small-scale values. Voxels on the boundary of objects have smallest scale values. Because of these observations, we conclude that TIB patterns constitute only small b-scale values; thus, it is reasonable to consider voxels with small b-scale values as candidate TIB patterns. Similarly, it is practical to discard voxels with high b-scale values from the candidate selection procedure. Figs. 2 (candidate selection) and 4(a) show selected b-scale regions as candidate TIB patterns. Once b-scale image correspondence of segmented chest CT is obtained as noted in Fig. 4(a), we only select small b-scale values via thresholding the large b-scale values [see Fig. 4(b)]. Justification of this selection procedure bases on the observations defined previously. Resultant candidate TIB patterns are shown in Fig. 4(c). We describe the computation of b-scale patterns and the details of the candidate selection process in the next section.\n",

For instance, boundary- and region-based representations of objects are explicitly contained in the scale-based methods. Based on continuity of homogeneous regions, geometric properties of objects (i.e., size information) can be identified, and this new representation is called scale images, i.e., b-scale, tensor-scale (t-scale), generalized-scale (g-scale) images [16], [18], [19]. The b-scale model has been shown to be extremely useful in object recognition [17], image segmentation [9], [41], filtering [16], inhomogeneity correction [20], and image registration [20], [21]. In this study, on the other hand, we show how to use b-scale encoding together with a proper scale selection method for detecting candidate abnormality patterns. The main idea in b-scale encoding is to determine the size of local structures at every voxel as the radius of the largest ball centered at the voxel within which intensities are homogeneous under a prespecified region-homogeneity criterion.",

The best performance is obtained when we combine the proposed shape and GLCM features. This is to be expected because spatial statistics are incorporated into the shape features such that texture and shape features are often complementary to each other. On the other hand, compared to the proposed shape features, the LGS and SI features have lower detection rates because they are not affine (and M\u00f6bius) invariant and eventually having difficulty in appreciating the large amount of details of TIB patterns. Another reason is that there is no optimal choice of thresholding process and this may yield less remarkable statistical measurements over local patches. However, the LGS and SI features alone perform better than the high-dimensional conventional features similar to the proposed shape features. This result itself suggests the use of local shape features and their adapted extensions in detection of TIB patterns.",

Moreover, our proposed local shape features illustrate the usefulness of the invariant properties, Willmore energy in particular, to analyze TIB patterns in chest CT.
