SARS-CoV-2 efficiently replicates in the upper respiratory tract and can proceed into the lower respiratory tract where it exacerbates pre-existing lung conditions. It infects human cells when the S protein located on the surface of the coronavirus particle binds with high affinity to a protein exposed on the surface of the cells in the respiratory tract. Binding occurs through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. SARS-CoV-2, akin to several other coronaviruses, uses angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) as an entry port into a lung cell [1] .",

It suggested that SARS-CoV-2 emerged naturally, through a recombination of at least two viruses: a bat b-coronavirus (b-CoV) (genus Rhinolophus) and a pangolin b-CoV, neither of which normally infects humans [2] . The bat b-CoV is 96% similar to SARS-CoV-2, but it has a divergent receptor-binding domain in the S protein (only 60% similar to SARS-CoV-2) and binds poorly to human ACE-2. This makes it unlikely to enter human cells. The pangolin b-CoV is only 90% similar to SARS-CoV-2, but the RBD of its S protein has 99% similarity with SARS-CoV-2, and it has high affinity to ACE-2 [3] . In fact, its affinity to ACE-2 is higher than that of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD, as indicated in two recent studies [4, 5] .",

The RBD from the pangolin virus has additional implications for the infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2. It harbours a furin enzyme cleavage site. Cleavage of the S protein at a furin cleavage site facilitates the entry of many viruses, including influenza viruses and CoVs into human cells. The importance of proteolytic cleavage at the furin cleavage site for the zoonotic transmission of viruses is in part based on experimental data with the MERS-like CoV from bats, which cannot efficiently enter human cells, unless small amounts of trypsin protease are added to the virion to mimic the furin cleavage of the S protein [6] . Interestingly, the ability of the S protein to be cleaved by the cellular furin protease is readily lost when CoVs are propagated in cell cultures, as shown with a feline CoV [7] . This implies that the acquisition of the furin cleavage site might be a gain of function for CoVs, but is lost when virus is amplified in cell cultures (Scheme 1).",

To have a better idea, when R0 < 1 the virus will disappear from the population over time, whereas R0> 2 means that the spread is exponential. One of the earliest hotspots of the virus was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan. A study performed on that ship showed that when social distancing was not implemented in the early phase of the epidemic, the transmission factor of SARS-CoV-2 was in the range of 15. This means that each infected person on the boat transferred the infection on average to 15 uninfected individuals. This is a very high transmission factor, similar to measles virus, and highlights the importance of social distancing in limiting the spread of the COVID-19 [10] .",

Yet, the coronaviruses encode several accessory proteins which reduce the error rate to about 1 in 0.5-2 million bases [13, 14] . This means that only one out of 15-60 progeny viruses has a single point mutation in its genome. This is much lower than other RNA viruses and renders coronaviruses genetically rather stable, unless they recombine their genomes with a related CoV. In addition, the vast majority of the mutations have no phenotype, and they do not change viral infectivity. So, the good news is that SARS-CoV-2 has a low mutation rate (just one or two nucleotides a month, compared to four-eight nucleotides a month in influenza virus). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the circulating virus has mutated to a more aggressive phenotype from November 2019 to March 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 NCBI reference nucleotide sequence (NC045512) was used as query. Sequences of the S protein from different CoVs are indicated in brackets with their respective animal origin, strain name and NCBI accession numbers. The ACE-2 RBD coding region is framed with dotted lines. The pairwise similarity between all sequences in a multiple sequence alignment (CLUSTALW; http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) [20] was calculated with a 200-nt window moved along the sequence in 10 nt steps using the software SIMPLOT v3.5.1 [21] .

            "text": "Other therapeutic approaches involve the use of antivirals, such as remdesivir, which is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits the replication of the viral genome. It works very well in cell culture against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [17, 18] . Other strategies explore the use of furin protease inhibitors. Researchers around the world are making strong efforts to prepare cocktails of monoclonal antibodies that can neutralise the virus. If this works, it can be scaled up and used for patients with acute infection, in order to reduce the viral load. However, this approach is expensive and may be difficult to distribute because it involves biologicals which are subject to denaturation if stored improperly, or not kept in a cold chain. In addition, it is unclear how long-lasting the effects of antivirals can be, because drug-resistant viruses will inevitably emerge. Nevertheless, direct antivirals will be useful, as they buy time while patients develop immunity.",

For example, if we inhibit ACE-2, we can slow down viral entry. This of course will also inhibit the receptor's physiological function, but researchers believe the body could tolerate the inhibition. Yet, viruses have been shown to be able to switch cell receptors in some cases. Receptor-targeting approaches might not be effective in the long run. Finally, doctors are using an IL6 receptor blocker, developed by Roche for treating rheumatoid arthritis. This drug basically inhibits the inflammatory response, easing out the symptoms in people who are heavily infected with lower respiratory disease. Whether an overshooting inflammatory response is a universal feature of lower respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be seen.",
