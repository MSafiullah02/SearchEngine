Since the emergence of H5N1 HPAIVs in Asia [3], numerous global efforts have focused on elucidating the relative roles of wild bird and poultry movement in virus dissemination. To better understand the ecology of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in wild birds, the data from wild bird surveillance studies are used to identify factors correlated with AIV detection in wild birds, such as reservoir species, bird health status, age, season, and location [4].",

These viruses replicate in columnar epithelial cells, forming crypts in the colon, and they are excreted in feces [5]. The infections of these AIVs do not cause illness in birds; however, current H5 HPAIVs that have been isolated in Asia, Europe, and Africa have caused death in several wild bird species [6].",

Direct sequencing of gene segments was performed using a BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies) and a 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies). For sequencing some isolates, next-generation sequencing was applied as follows. MiSeq libraries were prepared using KAPA RNA Hyper Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and KAPA Dual-Indexed Adapter Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The prepared MiSeq libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq by using MiSeq Reagent kit v3 (Illumina, Inc.) with 2 \u00d7 300 bp paired-end read length. The sequencing data were analyzed using GENETYX Network version 12 (Genetyx Co., Tokyo, Japan), GeneStudio (https://genestudio.com/), or CLC Genomics Workbench 12 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

For other gene segments, each segment was classified together with multivariable subtype viruses circulating among wild birds (Supplemental Figs. S1\u2013S5, S7, S8). Moreover, the H7 HA genes were phylogenetically divided into several lineages: Eurasian, Australian, Historical Europe, and North American.

All H7Nx isolates isolated in Mongolia in 2017 and 2019 belonged to the European\u2013Asian sub-lineage.

However, sustained, comprehensive, coordinated global efforts to monitor the continually changing genetic diversity of AIVs circulating in nature remain insufficient to predict the emergence of novel HPAIVs and human infections of AIVs. Wild aquatic birds have played a role in the evolution of H5 HPAIVs by reassortment with LPAIVs. These factors have contributed to the spread of these viruses to parts of Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America after an outbreak in wild birds at Qinghai Lake in China in 2005 [14]. Circulations of H7 LPAIVs in wild birds and poultry have been reported throughout the world [7, 13, 15\u201320]. In addition, H7N9 HPAIVs and LPAIVs are at risk to spread by wild bird and human-caused movements [21, 22]. In our surveillance conducted over the past 5 years, targeting migratory waterfowl in four different lakes in the central region of Mongolia, 167 viruses were isolated. No HPAIVs were isolated from the fecal samples of migratory waterfowl in the present study, indicating that the circulation of HPAIVs in the northern nesting lake is still limited. However, these do not fully represent the country state in terms of the infection of IAV in wild birds.",
