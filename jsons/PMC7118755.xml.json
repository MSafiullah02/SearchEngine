Following an outbreak in 2004 of a highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by the H5N1 virus, the World Health Organization noted in 2005 that \u2018the world has moved closer to a pandemic than at any time since 1968\u2019.2 More recently, Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, has noted that \u2018For the first time in history, the world has been watching the conditions that might start an influenza pandemic unfold in real-time\u2019.3 While human-to-human transmission of the virus has yet to be established, by 19 June 2008, there had been 385 cases of human infection with the H5N1 virus, including 243 deaths, primarily in South East Asian countries. The World Health Assembly has called on its member states to develop national preparedness plans,4 and the World Health Organization has provided recommendations5 and checklists6 for national plans. While many countries have taken steps to develop preparedness plans for an influenza pandemic, variations between countries and gaps in the plans are still evident.7\n",

Legal frameworks can clarify the rights and duties of individuals, communities and governments for times of crisis, and public discussions around these issues can themselves help to alleviate community anxiety. In thinking about the legal framework, there are two main issues to be addressed. First, there is a need for an understanding of the role of law in public health at state, national and international levels, and the need for jurisdictional clarity when differing levels of law and government intersect. These legal frameworks are important, for they define the scope of government responses to public health emergencies at local, national and international level. Secondly, our understandings of the role of law in responding to pandemics are necessarily informed by relational bonds between individuals in society, and by the meanings of rights and responsibilities for public health laws when dealing with infectious disease.",

As Magnusson points out, in the context of liberal democracies, debates about the boundaries and meanings of public health law reflect \u2018competing claims about the boundaries for the legitimate exercise of political and administrative power\u2019.15 Our understandings of law and ethics, and indeed of health itself, are culturally and historically specific, requiring dialogue and cooperation for effective global responses to issues of common concern.",

The reality is somewhat more complex than this suggests, as the Federal Government can achieve public health objectives through the use of its other constitutional powers, such as the grants power in Section 96 of the Constitution which allows the Federal Government to make financial grants to the states, and the spending power in Section 81 which allows the Federal Government to fund health programs.17, 19 However, while the Federal Government can seek to use its other constitutional powers to achieve health-related objectives, it is important to realize that the power under Section 51(ix) of the Constitution to make laws \u2018with respect to quarantine\u2019 is the only power relating to communicable diseases directly given to the Federal Government in the Constitution, and that this, in turn, shapes Australian debates about government responses to public health issues and emergencies.",

While there is still benefit in this focus, it is inadequate for a world where international travel is now primarily by aircraft, and passengers can travel from one country to another before they even realize that they are sick.33 As a Canadian report on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) noted, \u2018SARS has illustrated that we are constantly a short flight away from serious epidemics\u2019.28 While previous outbreaks of pandemic influenza have traditionally taken 6\u20138 months to spread globally,29 aided by international air travel, pandemic influenza could spread globally within 3 months.30 This potential for quarantinable diseases to emerge within domestic populations raises questions about the scope and applicability of quarantine laws in these circumstances. However, it has been argued that the broad scope of quarantine under the Act, the fact that quarantine powers are not restricted to ports of entry, and the ability for state laws to be over-ridden in emergencies suggests that the federal quarantine power could also have domestic application.31\n",

In New South Wales, for example, SARS and avian influenza in humans are both notifiable diseases under the Public Health Act 1991.\n32 State public health laws also contain a range of measures to enable health authorities to restrict the spread of disease, including powers to require medical testing and, in some cases, powers to restrict movement or to specify treatment of individuals who are regarded as posing a risk to public health.a\nThe intersections between federal and state laws are relevant to Australia's responses to public health threats. As Howse has noted, \u2018in a public health emergency caused by the spread of an emerging infectious disease, Australia could need to rely on a patchwork of legislative measures to assist it to cope\u2019.34 In Australia and elsewhere, cross-jurisdictional and interagency cooperation are essential components in effective emergency responses.35, 36\n",

The IHR (2005) seek to balance public health responses to disease against the needs of international traffic and trade, and rest on the principle that public health responses should not unnecessarily interfere with international traffic and trade. While the IHR (2005) has a list of specified diseases, including SARS and smallpox, which must be notified to the World Health Organization, the IHR (2005) also move beyond the specified-diseases approach and adopt a broader approach with focus on events which could constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Using a decision algorithm, countries are required to assess public health events in order to determine whether the event is a public health emergency of international concern. If the event is of international significance, notification to the World Health Organization is required. The new IHR focus on risks to health, and provide a more flexible and relevant approach to identification of those risks.39, 40\n",
