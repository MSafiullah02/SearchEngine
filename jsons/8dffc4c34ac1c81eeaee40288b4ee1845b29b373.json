Over the total observation period of 4 winter seasons. 780 children were screened with a nasal swab for the presence of viruses. Of those. 230 (29.5%) had a positive viral culture. The viruses identified w'ere respiratory' syncytial virus (RSV). influenza A and B virus, parain fluenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus. adenovirus and enterovirus. During that time, 83 epi demic events in 47 DCC were recorded. A particular virus wasjudged to be causally related to an epidemic if the identical virus was isolated in > 3 children during the same outbreak of respiratory diseases. Thus, in 51 cases (61.4%) of all epidemics, the following viruses were responsible for an epidemic: RSV (n = 23), coronavirus (n = 10) (only during the season of 1993-1994), influenza A virus (n = 6), rhinovirus (n = 4), enterovirus (n = 4), adenovirus (n = 3) and parainfluenza virus (n = 1). Except for the somewhat surprising accumulation of coro navirus epidemics during the winter of 1993-1994, there were only minor seasonal variations from one year to another. As expected. RSV accounted for about one third of all respiratory' tract infections in children attending DCCs and was therefore the most important single causative agent. These results are compared with data from children who did not attend a DCC and were cared for in a private practice. During the winter of 1989-1990, the viral epidemiological survey was performed at the same time and in parallel to a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study investigating the efficacy of OM-85 BV. an immunoactive bacterial extract. This study, enrolling 423 children attending DCCs demonstrated a protec tive effect of OM-85 BV in significantly reducing the risk of recurrent infections of the upper respiratory tract during the treatment period with the compound. 34% of all participating children (75 in the verum group, 70 in the placebo group) were enrolled in an additional virological study. In these patients, RSV was isolated 10 times in the placebo group, but only 5 times in the treated group (p < 0.05) and influenza A virus was present in 4 children in the placebo group, but only in 1 infant in the verum group giving a total of 14 positive virologie results in the placebo group versus 6 in the verum group Ip < 0.05). Despite the small numbers of children investigated for their virologie status during respiratory infectious outbreaks, there was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of virus carriers in favor of the children treated with OM-85 BV. These results corroborate the clinical findings.",

The risk of developing a first episode of common cold with fever, oti tis or wheezy bronchitis in the early months following admission to a DCC is significantly higher in these infants than in children who stay at home [1] , Other recent sur veys implemented in Pennsylvania [2, 3] and Georgia [4, 5] also demonstrated that the risk of respiratory illnesses associated with DCC attendance was significantly higher for the youngest children. The main risk factor is age, this being related to the disappearance of the protecting ma ternal antibodies within 3-4 months after birth rendering the infants susceptible to new infectious agents and leav ing them with a still immature immune system.",

In a large epidemiological study entitled 'Sant\u00e9-Enfant-Cr\u00eache' ('Health-Child-Day-Care'), 1,242 children aged 3 months to 3 years were enrolled between October 1988 and June 1989. During that period, out of a total of 3,639 infectious episodes, 2,916 infections of the upper respiratory tract (URT) were recorded, representing 80.1% of all episodes. The mean number of URT diseases per child varied depending on the type of DDC: 2.78 infectious episodes per child for the larger DCCs (>40 children), 3.47 for the small DCCs (20-40 children) and 2.46 for family day care. These figures contrast with the incidence of infectious episodes for chil dren cared for at home: 0.63 [6] , Viruses are the most frequent \u00e9tiologie agents for respi ratory tract infections in the first year of life, of which the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is well known to be the major cause [7] [8] [9] .

OM-85 BV has been shown to significantly reduce the number of recurrent respiratory infections in children [20] and adults [21] . Given the fact that the bacterial extract induces a nonspecific stimula tion of the mucosal immune defense mechanisms [22] , it can be hypothesized that this protection is also conferred to viral infections of the upper respiratory tract in chil dren. Despite the small numbers of children investigated in this study for their virologic status during respiratory infectious outbreaks, there was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of virus carriers in favor of the children treated with OM-85 BV. These results corro borate the clinical findings. In conclusion, the preliminary data with OM-85 BV demonstrate a significantly reduced incidence of positive cultures for RSV and influenza A as compared to placebo and indicate a new and potentially very useful approach towards controlling recurrent out breaks of respiratory illnesses in DCCs.",
