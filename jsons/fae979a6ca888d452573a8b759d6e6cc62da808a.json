The rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by fast and unambiguous testing is widely recognized to be critical in responding to the ongoing outbreak. Since the current testing capacity of RT-PCR-based methods is being challenged due to the extraordinary demand of supplies, such as RNA extraction kits and PCR reagents worldwide, alternative and/or complementary testing assays should be developed. Here, we exploit the potential of mass spectrometry technology combined with machine learning algorithms as an alternative fast tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs samples. According to our preliminary results, mass spectrometry-based methods combined with multivariate analysis showed an interesting potential as a complementary diagnostic tool and further steps should be focused on sample preparation protocols and the improvement of the technology applied.",

As of the April 4 th 2020 there were over 1.2M confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 175 countries, with over 65,000 fatalities (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is one of four new pathogenic viruses which have jumped from animal to human hosts over the past 20 years, and the current pandemic sends warning signs about the need for preparedness and associated research. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 ranges from mild to severe with a high proportion of the population having no symptoms yet being equally infectious (Yang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2019) . Together, these features have led to intensive lockdown measures in most countries with the aim to restrict the spread of the virus, limit the burden on healthcare systems and reduce mortality rate. In parallel, there has been an extraordinary response from the scientific community. These collective efforts aim to understand the pathogenesis of the disease, to evaluate treatment strategies and to develop a vaccine at unprecedented speeds in order to minimize its impact on individuals and on the global economy (Li, 2016; Wenzhong and Hualan, Preprint) .",

Spectrum summarizing, peak matching and peak assignment was performed according to instructions from Bionumerics. In short, all raw spectra were summarized into isolate spectra, and peak matching, using the option \"existing peak classes only\", was performed on isolate spectra using a constant tolerance of 1.9, a linear tolerance of 550 and a peak detection rate of 10%. Binary peak matching tables were exported to summarize the presence of peak classes. By assigning biomarkers, only the presence and absence of peaks was investigated. To also assess quantitative peak data such as peak intensity and peak area, a multivariate unsupervised statistical tool PCA was additionally performed. All samples were examined for the unique masses (\u00b1 10 Da).",

These preliminary results suggest that MALDI-TOF MS coupled with ClinProTools software represents an interesting alternative as a screening tool for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, especially because of the good performance and accuracy obtained with samples in which viral presence was not detected. More samples need to be analyzed in order to make a definitive statement.
