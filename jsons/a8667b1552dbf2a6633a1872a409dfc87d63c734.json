            "text": "Cathepsins are proteolytic enzymes with a broad spectrum of substrates. They are known to reside within endo-lysosomes where they acquire optimal conditions for proteolytic activity and substrate cleavage. However, cathepsins have been detected in locations other than the canonical compartments of the endocytotic pathway. They are often secreted from cells in either proteolytically inactive proform or as mature and active enzyme; this may happen in both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, cytosolic and nuclear forms of cathepsins have been described and are currently an emerging field of research aiming at understanding their functions in such unexpected cellular locations. This chapter summarizes the canonical pathways of biosynthesis and transport of cathepsins in healthy cells. We further describe how cathepsins can reach unexpected locations such as the extracellular space or the cytosol and the nuclear matrix. No matter where viruses and cathepsins encounter, several outcomes can be perceived. Thus, scenarios are discussed on how cathepsins may support virus entry into host cells, involve in viral fusion factor and polyprotein processing in different host cell compartments, or help in packaging of viral particles during maturation. It is of note to mention that this review is not meant to comprehensively cover the present literature on viruses encountering cathepsins but rather illustrates, on some representative examples, the possible roles of cathepsins in replication of viruses and in the course of disease. 250 10.",

Procathepsins can also follow the secretory pathway when skipping recognition by CD-MPR at the TGN (left). Upon secretion, the procathepsins can be recaptured with the help of CI-MPR (green) at the plasma membrane (top, center) . Retrograde transport of vesicles containing cathepsins recruited out of late endosomes or lysosomes explains the secretion of mature cathepsins into the extracellular space (bottom, right). LDL receptor-related proteins (LRPs; blue) serve as alternative cell surface receptors binding pro-and mature cathepsins for localized pericellular action (top, center) or re-internalization and delivery to endo-lysosomes. Specific forms of cathepsins are also present in the cytosol and in the nuclear matrix (pink-yellow), where they are involved in processing of transcription factors, core, and linker histones, in part by being bound to DNA. Secreted, extracellular cathepsins can interact, in principle, with viruses (cyan-violet-dark yellow) before endocytic entry (top, center) , especially when bound to cell surface receptors like the CI-MPR (green) or an LRP (blue). In addition, cathepsins in the pericellular space may interfere by proteolytically processing viral proteins or by involving in shedding of cellular constituents, such as the glycocalyx, thereby enhancing the likelihood of viral entry.",

Aspartic acid or cysteine residues are part of the catalytic dyad of the aspartic and cysteine cathepsins, respectively, while serine is part of a catalytic triad in which an additional residue is required to stabilize the oxyanion hole in the acyl intermediate upon interaction between the enzyme and its substrate. Aspartic cathepsins are acting as water nucleophiles, whereas cysteine and serine cathepsins act as protein nucleophiles (Baici et al. 2013) . Hence, the nucleophile is provided by a side chain of an amino acid in the active site, namely, the sulfhydryl or the hydroxyl group of either cysteine or serine, respectively, in cysteine and serine cathepsins. For example, serine bears the nucleophilic hydroxyl group of serine cathepsins, while histidine acts as the general base. In addition, aspartate helps to orient the imidazolium ring of histidine such that it activates serine to perform the nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate, whereby a temporary complex between the enzyme and its substrate forms, i.e., the acyl intermediate. This breaks down rapidly, resulting in protonation of the general base histidine. Subsequent hydrolysis of the scissile bond occurs when a water molecule enters. The reaction mechanism of peptide bond hydrolysis catalyzed by cathepsins therefore involves two substrates, the protein or peptide substrate and a water molecule, and two products are generated, namely, an N-and a C-terminal peptide product.",

            "text": "Most of the cathepsins act as endopeptidases ( Fig. 10 .2). However, the cysteine cathepsins B and X, the serine cathepsin A, and legumain are also acting as carboxypeptidases, whereas cysteine cathepsin H acts as an aminopeptidase and cysteine cathepsin C forms dimers acting as dipeptidyl peptidase ( Fig. 10 .2). Thus, cathepsins are mostly acting on their peptide or protein substrates as monomers, but some can dimerize or even multimerize, thereby eventually altering substrate specificity (see also below). Proteolytic activity and substrate specificity are typically determined with recombinant enzyme preparations in well-defined in vitro assays. According to the Schechter and Berger nomenclature (Schechter and Berger 1968) , the amino acids next to the scissile bond toward the N-terminus of the substrate are named P1, P2, P3, and P4, while the C-terminal amino acid next to the scissile bond is named P1\u2032, and the following amino acids of the substrate are referred to as P2\u2032, P3\u2032, and P4\u2032, respectively. The substrate-binding pockets in the cathepsins are named accordingly as S1-S4 and S1\u2032-S4\u2032, respectively, as for every other peptidase. Standard assays to determine the activity of cathepsins are available, as are synthetic substrates, which are preferentially or specifically cleaved by the enzymes. Standard cathepsin activity assays mainly consider peptide cleavage at optimal conditions, whereby a reducing environment of acidic to slightly acidic pH-mimicking the conditions in the endo-lysosomal compartments-is considered as the main determinant. The reader is referred to the Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes (Barrett 2004) and to the \"MEROPS database\" (www.merops.sanger.ac.uk) (Rawlings et al. 2016) , which provides a comprehensive and excellent compendium of proteases, their substrates, and inhibitors, for further up-to-date information.",

The aspartic cathepsins D and E, which are mostly detected in lysosomes, are inhibited by pepstatin (Dean 1979) or by a natural product isolated from the sea anemone Actinia equina, equistatin. This latter inhibitor interestingly also interacts with cysteine peptidases (Lenarcic et al. 1997; Lenarcic and Turk 1999) including the cysteine cathepsins that are found preferentially in endo-lysosomes but also frequently in extra-and pericellular locations. Furthermore, aberrant or alternative forms of cysteine cathepsins are detected in the cytosol, as well as the nuclear and mitochondrial matrices . Cytosolic cystatins A and B, also known as stefins A and B Brzin et al. 1983 ), as well as secreted cystatins C, D, E/M, F, and SN (Barrett 1986; Sloane et al. 1990; Turk and Bode 1991; Alvarez-Fernandez et al. 1999; Abrahamson et al. 2003; Turk et al. 2008; Zeeuwen et al. 2009 ) serve as endogenous inhibitors of the cysteine cathepsins. In addition, alpha-2-macroglobulin has been identified as an inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins (Fritz 1979; Travis 1988) . Cysteine cathepsins, in principle, can also be inhibited by serpins, which are cross-class inhibitors of serine proteases (Silverman et al. 2001) . Like the cystatins, serpins are present intra-and extracellularly. Serpins have a reactive center loop that serves as a bait for the attacking serine protease and, upon cleavage, remains bound by covalent linkage to the enzyme (Huntington 2006; Whisstock et al. 2010 ).",

Such strategies in using antibodies for the detection of cathepsins often bear specificity problems (Weber et al. 2015) , because cathepsins are evolutionary conserved and show extensive sequence homologies. Synthetic substrates, like chromogenic or fluorogenic peptides, are available for in vitro activity assays (see, MEROPS database for further details). Likewise, cytoor histochemical approaches have been described, which employ synthetic cathepsin substrates that are converted into products less diffusible and readily detected by means of microscopy (Spiess et al. 1994; Brix et al. 1996) . Enzymography in polyacrylamide gels is another means of determining multiple cathepsin activities at a time in cell or tissue lysates (Chen and Platt 2011; Platt et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "The most elegant way to visualize cathepsin activities \"on the spot\" and in a quantitative manner is by using so-called activity-based probes (ABPs) (Greenbaum et al. 2002; Jessani et al. 2004; Blum et al. 2005; Blum 2008; Edgington et al. 2011; Blais et al. 2012; Zou et al. 2012; Grzywa and Sie\u0144czyk 2013; Sanman and Bogyo 2014) . ABPs consist of a reactive functional group (so-called warhead) that binds to the target protease, a linker region that resembles a peptide substrate, and additional tagging groups. The tagging groups are typically fluorogenic, but biotin or iodinatable moieties have also been chemically engineered onto ABPs. Hence, a family or subfamilies of cathepsins are functionally addressed and become covalently tagged upon cleavage of the ABP's linker. ABPs are available as broad-spectrum probes used in approaching the proteolytic activities of aspartic, cysteine, and serine cathepsins. In addition, specific ABPs have been synthesized that can be cleaved by one or only few cathepsins. Moreover, ABPs with propeptide-mimicking features in the peptide backbone have been used (Schaschke et al. 1998; Diederich et al. 2012) . Such highly specific ABPs are, in principle, able to distinguish even closely related cathepsins.",

This is to say that most ABPs act as inhibitors that are attacked and cleaved in a substrate-like fashion, but remain bound to the targeted enzyme, thus forming an irreversible, covalent complex with the target protease. The concept of ABP labeling of cathepsins can be compared with the suicidal inhibition mechanism of the serpins on their target proteases (see above). The principle of specific and irreversible binding bears the advantage of rendering ABPs into quantitative probes that allow to detect only mature, proteolytically active cathepsins. However, the disadvantage of many ABPs is equally intrinsic, namely, they act as protease inhibitors and may eventually lead to pharmacological knockdown of proteolytic activities when applied to living cells.",

Such experiments have helped to uncover the transport pathways that are followed by pro-and mature cathepsins in different eukaryotic cells. Importantly, it is now state of the art to distinguish proteolytically active from inactive cathepsins. Moreover, it became clear that each and every cell type may use cathepsins strategically in its own, distinct way in support of the specific cell's function Mohamed and Sloane 2006; Sloane et al. 2013; Weiss-Sadan et al. 2017) . Hence, subcellular locations of cathepsin activities have been detected that encompass the expected canonical endo-lysosomal compartments. However, quite often locations of cathepsin activities were detected which were, by all means, unexpected. Thus, cathepsins exhibit an astonishing variety of transport pathways to reach numerous intra-and extracellular locations where the proteases may function in a spatially confined and temporally regulated manner (Mohamed and Sloane 2006; Gocheva and Joyce 2007; Brix et al. 2013 Brix et al. , 2015 Akkari et al. 2016 ).",

Pericellularly, the procathepsins may become activated by soluble endopeptidases or through the action of plasma membrane-bound ectoenzymes. Yet another pathway is used in particular in cells of the innate immune system, like macrophages, that express the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR, also referred to as IGFII/M6PR) (Mason et al. 1987; Pohlmann et al. 1995; Collette et al. 2004 ). This cell surface receptor acts as a scavenger receptor and functions in rescuing faulty or excessively secreted procathepsins for subsequent internalization by endocytosis and sorting along the endocytic pathway. Hence, during their transport from the extracellular space via early endosomes to late endosomes ( Fig. 10 .1, right transport route), such secreted forms of cathepsins eventually are activated in the same compartment as those following the default transport pathway but delayed in time.",

Moreover, this protein serves as a regulator of a number of proteases, namely, it is an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and cysteine cathepsins alike. Other receptors known to interact with secreted cathepsins are those of the diverse low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-like protein (LRP) family of transmembrane proteins present at the cell surface of almost all cell types (Poller et al. 1995; Willnow et al. 1996; Herz and Strickland 2001) . Megalin/ gp330 is one of the LRPs that is supposed to mediate internalization and endo-lysosomal delivery of cathepsins, if previously secreted by mistake (Nielsen et al. 2007 ).

            "text": "Pericellular and extracellular localization of procathepsins and mature cathepsins has been observed under both physiological and pathological conditions. For instance, cathepsin-mediated extracellular proteolysis has been shown to promote cancer cell invasion and tumor progression through extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation (Rochefort et al. 2000; Joyce and Hanahan 2004; Liaudet-Coopman et al. 2006; Mohamed and Sloane 2006; Gocheva and Joyce 2007; Sloane et al. 2013) . It remains to be seen, however, if the enhanced cathepsin secretion responsible for excessive ECM degradation is triggered by the acidic environment in tumor tissue or by other mechanisms (Cavallo-Medved and Sloane 2003) . Depending on the extracellular conditions, cathepsins may acquire altered or additional substrate preferences. For example, the cysteine cathepsin K is secreted under physiological conditions as an active enzyme and acts in the acidic resorption lacuna formed by osteoclasts during bone turnover (Gelb et al. 1996; Saftig et al. 1998; Rachner et al. 2011; Fonovi\u0107 and Turk 2014; Br\u00f6mme et al. 2016 ). However, cathepsin K is also responsible for degradation of thyroglobulin in the extracellular thyroid follicle lumen, namely, at neutral pH and in oxidizing conditions (Tepel et al. 2000; Friedrichs et al. 2003; Jordans et al. 2009 ). Moreover, secreted cathepsin K monomers can interact with each other, thereby forming polymeric ringlike structures, depending on the molecular composition of the extracellular space (Li et al. 2002) . It has been shown that ECM components like glycosaminoglycans and other constituents are essential as scaffolding factors supporting extracellular interactions of cathepsin K molecules (Li et al. 2004 ). Moreover, cathepsin K can be stabilized extracellularly by binding to cell surface molecules like clusterin (Novinec et al. 2012) , which also interacts with protease receptors of the LRP family, e.g., megalin/ gp330 (Lemansky et al. 1999) . Importantly, the activity of this particular enzymecysteine cathepsin K-differs in monomeric and dimeric as well as in soluble and ECM-or membrane-bound form (Aguda et al. 2014) . Hence, different substrates can be cleaved by the same cathepsin, and a given substrate can be processed differently by that enzyme, depending on whether the cathepsin is secreted as an active monomer or dimer, scaffolded by ECM constituents, or bound by cell surface receptors complexed with allosteric cofactors. It is important to note that cysteine cathepsin K is well-studied, in particular, because of its significance as an anti-osteoporotic drug target.",

However, the phenomenon of leaky lysosomes has also been known for long. Cellular stress as is the case with cancer cells under prolonged drug treatment or UV irradiation can cause leakiness of endo-lysosomal membranes. Mature cathepsins may then be released into the cytosol, where proteolytic activity is controlled by different means, such as endogenous inhibitors that specifically bind to the enzymes or other biochemical properties of the cytosol that are not optimal for cathepsinmediated cleavage. However, when escaping these safeguarding measures by, for instance, inhibitor downregulation, proteolytically active cathepsins may be present in the cytosol for prolonged time intervals and induce apoptotic, necrotic, or pyroptotic cascades resulting in cell death (Turk et al. 2000; Luke et al. 2007; Turk and Turk 2009; Aits and J\u00e4\u00e4ttel\u00e4 2013; Fl\u00fctsch and Gr\u00fctter 2013) .

They are therefore not targeted for entry into the ER lumen and will not follow the secretory pathway. Instead, N-terminally truncated cathepsins are retained in the cytosol and can even fold properly as they acquire a proteolytically active state in this unexpected location (Goulet and Nepveu 2004; Luke et al. 2007; Reiser et al. 2010; Tedelind et al. 2010) . Some of these alternative and aberrant forms of the cathepsins occur even in the nuclear matrix ( Fig. 10.1, center at bottom) . The mechanism by which they are transported through the nuclear pore complexes is not known, because most endo-lysosomal enzymes (except AEP/legumain) lack a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). It is reasonable to assume, however, that such nuclear cathepsins, as well as the cytosolic forms, are involved in processing of transcription factors, core, and/or linker histones. In vitro experiments further revealed an important role of DNA as a potential scaffolding factor that interferes with serpinmediated control of cathepsin activities in environments that mimic unexpected cellular locations like the nuclear matrix (Ong et al. 2007 ).",

Thus, treatment options of preventing host cell infection with SARS-CoV have been proposed that involve cysteine cathepsin L inhibitors (Tong 2006) . A very complex mechanism of proteolytic activation of the fusion proteins of henipaviruses (HNV) has been described as an essential prerequisite for infectivity and pathogenicity of these highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses (Weis and Maisner 2015) . The non-fusogenic F0 protein of HNV is translated in host cells and is subsequently transported along the secretory pathway in its inactive form to the plasma membrane. Upon re-internalization and processing in recycling endosomes by cathepsins B and L (Pager and Dutch 2005; Meulendyke et al. 2005; Vogt et al. 2005; Pager et al. 2006; Diederich et al. 2005 Diederich et al. , 2012 , activated F1/F2 complex travels back to the plasma membrane, where it is incorporated into budding virus particles, or mediates fusion of an infected cell with a neighboring cell.

Cathepsin cleavage enables the glycoprotein to interact with the Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NDC-1) protein of the host cell, which is an essential step in filovirus entry (Hunt et al. 2012) . Likewise, endosomal cathepsins are utilized by non-enveloped reoviruses for host cell entry.

Proteolytic activation of TLR9 is catalyzed by endosomal AEP/legumain and cathepsins (Bauer 2013) . Thus, cathepsins are also involved in the immune response to viral infection. Cathepsin-mediated processing of viral proteins-typically protein fusogenshappens in early and recycling endosomes (see above), which are connected with other compartments of the endocytic pathway, namely, also with late endosomes or multivesicular bodies (MVBs). MVBs are believed to serve as a place for generation of exosomes (Cocucci and Meldolesi 2015; Hurley 2015) . In this regard, it is interesting to note that infection with the filoviruses EBOV and MARV involves the molecular machinery of the ESCRT pathway, which is required for MVB formation and which is important for virus replication, nucleocapsid formation, and maturation in a compartment positive for late endosomal markers (Dolnik et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "Finally, a chapter on cathepsins in a book on viruses cannot end without placing a special note in the context of therapeutic approaches aiming at eliminating viruses from the host. In particular, the retroviral HIV protease is important for maturation of the virus particles and, hence, targeted therapeutically (Moyle and Gazzard 1996; Cooper 2002) . HIV proteinase structurally resembles the ubiquitously expressed aspartic cathepsin D, denoting the similarities between host cell's aspartic cathepsins and retroviral aspartic proteases, which are-in the case of HIV-successfully inhibited when approached by transition-state inhibitors. Therefore, and in conclusion, basic science researchers, virologists, and clinicians have learned a lot from the structural similarities of host cell cathepsins and viral proteases. We deduce that interactions between cell biologists and virologists bear more interesting facts to be gathered in the future. Moreover, many more potential therapeutic answers are to be developed from the encounters of cathepsins and the various viruses utilizing the proteases in their own favor. Hence, some of the comments in this chapter are meant in support of stimulating future discussions in the spirit of thinking \"out of the box,\" and, like the cathepsins, following paths beyond the canonical pathways. In our opinion, this is an endeavor worth to be undertaken and continued in the future.",
