The mice weighed 10-20 g at trapping and were assumed to be young adults at that time. Of these mice, 16 ultimately developed paralysis, 15 developed lymphoma, and 14 died from other causes. The average observation time in the laboratory was 10 months for the paralyzed mice, 15 months for the lymphomatous mice, and 24 months for mice remaining free of these diseases. Considerable individual variation was noted in p30 levels (text- fig. 1 ). However, mice destined to develop paralysis generally had a higher p30 titer at trapping than did those later developing lymphoma or remaining free of paralysis and lymphoma. At trapping, 11 of 16 (69%) mice eventually developing paralysis had serum p30 titers greater than 100 ng/ml, and only 4 of 15 (27%) developing lymphoma and 2 of 14 (14%) remaining free of these diseases had these serum p30 titers. When the paralysis group was compared with the combined lymphoma and \"normal\" groups by the Mann-Whitney U test (11), this difference was statistically significant (P=0.004). Mice dying with lymphoma showed a slightly, but not statistically significant, higher geometric mean titer of serum p30 at trapping than did mice that did not develop lymphoma. At death, markedly elevated serum p30 titers (>200 ng/ml) were found in almost all mice regardless of diagnosis, but mice dying with lymphoma or paralysis had slightly higher (not statistically significant) geometric mean titers (305 ng/ml) than did those dying from other causes (275 ng/ml).",

In addition to a high prevalence and amount of spleen gs antigen and type C J NATL CANCER INST particles in adult LC mice (l), we now show that gs antigen and infectious virus are first detectable in liver and spleen in the perinatal period and can be found thereafter in a more widespread tissue distribution, including the genital tissues. The positive correlation between detection of gs antigen at higher titer (~I:4), type C particles, and isola table virus in about 80% of LC mice after several weeks of age and the rapidly increasing incidence of high-titered gs antigen with age indicates that, by 1-2 months of postnatal life, most LC mice are extensively replicating infectious virus. Viremia probably accounts for the occasional virus isolations from skeletal muscles, placenta, and other gs antigen-negative tissues as well as for the elevated serum p30 levels. In inbred mouse strains, serum p30 levels greater than 100 p,g/ml were invariably associated with recovery of infectious virus from spleen cultures (12) . Furthermore, in recent studies (13, 14) , we demonstrated that about 80% of adult LC mice have free infectious virus and high levels of particulate reverse transcriptase activity in their sera.",

In this regard susceptible laboratory mice have been readily infected with the LC virus by foster nursing on LC females (Gardner MB, Klement V: Unpublished observations). Virus isolation from embryo cultures shows that the recovery of infectious virus was about twice as common in embryos that were not prerinsed with ether than in prerinsed ones. This suggests that external virus contamination from the maternal reproductive tract probably does account for some virus isolations, but it is not the only explanation for infectious virus recovered from the cultured embryos. The litter variation in virus expression also indicates a maternal influence on virus expression but does not establish whether this is a positive effect from epigenetic virus transmission or a negative effect from passively transferred antivirus neutralizing antibody. However, the former possibility seems most likely, since LC mice appear to have an ineffective humoral immune reactivity to their indigenous type C virus (13) . The cumulative disease incidence curves in aging LC mice indicate that, after a hiatus of 5-6 months, only 4% of the surviving mice develop either lymphoma or paralysis during each subsequent month of laboratory observation (4) . We showed that little difference exists in prevalence and titer of spleen CF gs antigen at necropsy in tumor-bearing or paralyzed LC mice as compared with age-matched non-tumor-bearing and non-paralyzed LC'mice (4). A similar conclusion was reached in a comparis6p of spleen p30 and gp69/71 antigen titers by RIA in lymphomatous, paralyzed, and normal LC wild mice (August jT: Personal communication). Little difference was also found between lymphomatous, paralyzed, and age-matched LG mice free of these diseases in the serum p30 antigen titers,by RIA at death. However, a comparison of serum p30 -antigen titers at trapping suggests that LC mice with the highest titer viremia early in life are those most at risk to the paralytic disease. Possibly only in those LC mice has vir-us infection been established in the central nervous system at a critically early age. On the other hand, LC mice destined to develop lymphoma could not be distinguished at trapping by the serum p30 titer from LC mice remaining lymphoma-free for a similar time. A more accurate index of virus load early in life (e.g., serum or tail infectious virus titers at 3-6 weeks of age) might better show in LC mice as in AKR X BALB/c crosses (17) a positive correlation in individual mice between virus titer early in life and relative risk to lymphoma.",

            "text": "These findings indicate that, although virus is the essential determinant of lymphoma and paralysis, factors other than virus titer alone are obviously involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The type C virus population in these wild mice is complex, consisting of a mixture of mouse-tropic virus and a new class of type C virus with a broad (amphotropic) host range (18) (19) (20) . Both classes of virus are N -tropic for mouse cells and thus would be detected by the virus isolation technique used in this study. Preliminary in vivo transmission experiments with limiting dilution-cloned or fluorescent focus-purified viruses suggest that the mouse-tropic strains can induce both rhe paralytic disease and lym-VOL. 57, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 1976 phoma, whereas the amphotropic strains induce only lymphoma [ (20) ; Parker jC, Hartley jW: Personal communication]. Therefore, the differences in serum p30 levels detected early in life could represent different ratios of these two classes of virus. Although both classes are apparently subject to Fv-1 b gene restriction, it is not yet determined if other genetic loci known to control susceptibility or resistance to viral leukemogenesis in laboratory mice (21) are also operative against each class of virus in wild mice. It will be of interest to relate lymphoma-paralysis resistance or susceptibility in individual LC wild mice with such genetic markers and with various measures of humoral and cellular immunity that may regulate the expression of each type of virus.",
