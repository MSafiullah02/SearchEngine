Thorax high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) suspected viral lung infection and incidentally detected enlarged axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on pharyngeal swab yielded negative results for SARS-CoV-2 infection, both at patient admission and 2 days after (days 1 and 3). Subsequently (day 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen was found positive; therefore, the patient was immediately referred to high-dose antibiotics administration for pneumonia and to [18F]-FDG PET-CT for suspected lymphoma relapse. The scan (day 6) demonstrated multiple FDG avid lymphadenopathies above and below the diaphragm and increased diffuse uptake in the spleen in keeping with NHL progression and suspected bowel involvement. Furthermore, concomitant pneumonia was confirmed due to faint and diffuse uptake within a left inferior lobe consolidation and a single non-FDG-avid peripheral rounded ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the right upper lobe. A follow-up (day 11) HRCT demonstrated GGO small reduction, further extension of left basal consolidation, and new periscissural thickening in the right apex. Then, a third RT-PCR test (day 12) finally revealed COVID-19. Two weeks later, despite hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, clinical and radiological worsening was documented (day 26) showing extensive interstitial viral involvement throughout both lungs. The patient started tocilizumab and required CPAP ventilation.",
