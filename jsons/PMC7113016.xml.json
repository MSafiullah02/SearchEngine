            "text": "The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is the most important emerging infectious disease (EID) of zoonotic and public health importance, in the Middle East and North Africa. The disease is caused by the MERS Coronavirus or MERSCoV, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, initially referred to as HCoV-EMC/2012 or Human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Centre/2012. The MERS virus is a lineage C betacoronavirus that causes pneumonia, renal failure and death in 30\u201340% of human patients [1] and much higher mortalities in people with concurrent diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac disease and chronic renal disease [2]. More than in any other country, a higher number of MERS-related human morbidities and deaths have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), with 1582 out of the 1917 (82\u00b752%) laboratory confirmed cases of the disease and 659 out of the 684 (96\u00b735%) associated case fatalities [3, 4]. It is believed that MERS originated as a zoonosis and that dromedaries are the main source of the primary human infection [5]. However, there is growing evidence that other animals apart from camels may have a role to play in human MERS infections. Coronaviruses have the inherent ability to infect more than one host species [6] and MERSCoV sequences have been detected in faecal pellets of a Taphosus perforatus bat in KSA [7]. The receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 or DPP4 that confers susceptibility to MERSCoV has been identified not only in human beings, camels and bats, but also in non-human primates (NHP) such as baboons, rhesus macaques and marmosets [8].",

In the southwest region of the country, these animals exist in the wild state and as commensals along major highways and around big cities such as Abha and Ta'if, locations where primary outbreaks of human MERS have occurred. Unlike wild baboons, commensal baboons frequently mingle with people, aggregate in large groups and survive mainly on provisioned food and edible wastes scavenged from household refuse bins and communal refuse dumps [10]. As previously observed, frequent exposure or contact between human beings, NHP and other animals may create avenues for cross-species transmissions of pathogens and introduction of new epidemics [11]. Non-human primates are susceptible to autologous as well as human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and such infections may be inapparent, or manifest as enterocolitis and diarrhoea, or pneumonia [12, 13]. The spectrum of clinical signs observed in human MERS victims [14], is similar to those observed in NHPs that are infected with coronaviruses [12, 13]. Whereas, similar genera of intestinal parasites have been identified in stool samples of baboons and people in locations where commensal baboons thrive in the southwestern region of KSA [15], no peer-reviewed data are available on the viral pathogens of the baboons of KSA, or the veterinary and public health implications of such infections.",

The location is surrounded by hills, the slopes of which served as sleeping sites for baboons and feral dogs. At the time of this study in mid-February 2013, the vegetation of the area was dominated by thorny Acacia trees, perennial shrubs (mainly Solanum incanum and Ochradenus baccatus),and herbs such as Aerva javanica, Argemone ochroleuca and Pennisetum setaceum. The year-round presence of large numbers of hamadryas baboons at the study site can be attributed to the availability in the area of many shady Acacia trees, several watering holes and an abundant, year-round supply of provisioned food and edible wastes from open rubbish heaps.",

Infant baboons were exempted from the study because the aim was to detect immunity that was active or based on exposure rather than passive (i.e. transplacental or transcolostral).

The subjects were identified to species level as previously described [17]. Each baboon was weighed with a hanging Salter scale, sexed by visual inspection of the external genitalia, age classified and examined physically for presence or absence of ectoparasites and signs or lesions of diseases. The subjects were age classified based on age-related changes in body weights and other physical traits of free-living hamadryas baboons as previously described [18]. The reproductive status of the adult females was determined by abdominal palpation and examination of the mammary glands for evidence of pregnancy and lactation, respectively. To prevent repeated sampling, each baboon was assigned a unique identification code and tagged with indelible ink. Between 5 and 8 ml of blood was collected from each baboon by aseptic venipuncture of the long saphenous vein and immediately transferred into labelled, sterile, plastic Vacutainer\u00ae tubes without anticoagulant. The blood collection tubes were placed on ice packs to facilitate clot formation. A piece of dry gauze was placed on the venipuncture site and digital pressure applied to control bleeding. Anesthetized baboons were monitored to full recovery and allowed to rejoin their groups.",

The high degree of genetic, anatomical and physiological similarities that exist between baboons and human beings predispose to cross-transmission of pathogens between the two groups [23]. We detected serum antibodies to HCoVs in 22% of the free-ranging commensal baboons sampled at Ta'if (Table 2). However, a previous study [9] reported a much higher HCoV seroprevalence (about 50%) in caged macaques and baboons concluding that close and prolonged exposure or contact between the infected and non-infected members held together in confinement can trigger higher transmission rates of coronavirus infections. HCoVs are spread efficiently by the respiratory route [24]. Therefore close exposure to humans rather than direct contact may sufficiently predispose NHP to anthroponotic HCoV infection. In contrast, animal coronaviruses are spread more efficiently by direct contact and the faecal-oral route [25]. We detected serum antibodies to CCoVs only in adult female baboons (Table 3). No juvenile females were sampled throughout the duration of the fieldwork at Ta'if. Female baboons at Ta'if were observed to be more directly involved in the adoption and grooming of puppies that were kidnapped by errant baboons, usually the alpha males. It has been reported that young puppies <2 months of age are particularly prone to CCoV infections [25] and that female baboons, especially paternal or maternal relatives rather than unrelated females, tend to groom one another more closely than their male counterparts [26]. These reports [25, 26] may explain the high frequency of CCoV infections we detected in female baboons.",

However, there is currently no evidence that immunocompetent human adults are at risk of contracting CCoV infections [32]. Canine coronaviruses are enzootic in dog populations across the world and dogs of all age groups and breeds are susceptible. Dogs infected with CCoV-1 or CCoV-2 (group 1 or alphacoronaviruses) may develop clinical signs including anorexia, diarrhoea, emesis and dehydration. Although CCoV-1 is typically self-limiting and results in few mortalities in dogs, in conjunction with CCoV-2, it runs a severe and rapidly fatal course in young puppies <2 months of age [33] and for older dogs with concurrent Canine distemper virus and Canine parvovirus type 2 infections [34, 35]. Canine coronavirus genotype 3 (CCoV-3) alone or in conjunction with parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, distemper virus, herpesvirus, influenza virus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp. and Streptococcus zooepidemicus, can cause an acute respiratory tract infection and pneumonia of dogs [36]. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report specific antibodies against CCoVs in free-living baboons. Because the subjects were apparently healthy, further investigations are required to demonstrate the status of infection of CCoVs in NHP and to determine if CCoVs evoke clinical illness or mortalities in NHP, or if infected primates shed the viable virus.",
