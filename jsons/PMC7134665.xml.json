The introduction of filtration followed by disinfection in major cities in the United States led to a dramatic reduction in typhoid and other diseases associated with fecally contaminated water. This ended the age of waterborne epidemics in the United States \u2014 or at least so everybody thought. Unexpectedly, in 1993 the largest waterborne outbreak of disease ever documented occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Over 400 000 persons developed gastroenteritis and perhaps 100 individuals died. Investigations revealed that the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum was responsible [1]. The organism appeared in high concentrations in the city\u2019s water source after a period of heavy rains, allowing some of the oocysts of the organism to penetrate the filtration barrier. Chlorine disinfection was found to have little effect on the viability of the oocysts. Surveys indicated that this organism was common in surface waters and was detected in 60% of the treated drinking water supplies in the United States 2., 3.. Since that time new rules for protecting surface water supplies and monitoring have been put into place in the United States and the UK [4\u2022].",

In 1998 the first of these lists was produced, and is referred to as the Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List, or the CCL [5]. This first CCL contained a list of 10 microorganisms (Box 1\n); the organisms were selected because of their potential for transmission by drinking water. Over the past few years a good deal of research has been conducted to better understand the potential for these organisms to be removed by drinking water treatment processes. From this list, Mycobacterium avium, microsporidia, and adenovirus appear to be the most difficult to control by conventional drinking water treatment, depending on the type of disinfection utilized. It is important that we gain an understanding of the cellular and molecular basis for this resistance and develop molecular methods for their detection. Considering these factors, other emerging groups of potential waterborne agents and our ability to control them are reviewed.Box 1Microorganisms on the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Contaminant Candidate List (CCL).\n\n",

            "text": "Waterborne pathogens have continued to emerge for a number reasons (listed in Box 2\n). The application of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to pathogen detection in water was a major breakthrough in our ability to demonstrate the responsibility of agents as causes of waterborne disease. This was especially true for agents that are difficult to isolate by cultural methods. PCR also provided a way to demonstrate that the agent in the water was identical to that causing illness in the exposed population. The development of molecular source tracking has led to a new field, which allows the identification of sources of waterborne agents [6]. Application of these tracking methods has demonstrated how globalization of world trade and travel has resulted in the introduction of pathogens largely limited to the developing world into the industrialized nations. Changes in the way we produce food have also led to increased risks from pathogens. For example, the rapid increase in confined feeding operations for livestock has increased point source surface and groundwater contamination by the wastes generated by these operations. In attempts to improve the quality of drinking water through changes in technology, we can change the relative importance of waterborne pathogens. For example, using ultraviolet (UV) light to disinfect wastewater to eliminate the production of chloramines can make it more difficult to control adenoviruses, which are the most resistant waterborne pathogen to UV light inactivation currently known [7\u2022]. However, adenoviruses are very sensitive to inactivation by chlorine.Box 2Reasons why waterborne pathogens continue to emerge.\n\n",

Currently, microsporidia are considered protozoa, but appear to be closely related to fungi. They produce an environmentally resistant stage (called a spore) of 1\u20133 \u03bcm in diameter. To date, over 1000 species of microsporidia capable of infecting animals have been described and are usually considered to be opportunistic pathogens in humans. So far, five genera have been associated with infections in humans, with Enterocytozoon bienusi, Enchephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon intestinalis causing the majority of infections. E. intestinalis has been detected in groundwater and water sources used for drinking water 8., 9.. Two recent studies have indicated that drinking water and swimming pools may be routes of transmission of microsporidia infection among AIDS patients 10., 11.. Recent research indicates that E. intestinalis is more resistant to chlorine than bacteria and viruses, but more sensitive than the cysts of the larger protozoa Giardia\n[12]. Like the waterborne protozoa Giardia and Cryptosporidium, it is very easily inactivated by UV light [13]. The effectiveness with which E. intestinalis can be removed by physical methods, conventional coagulation, sedimentation and mixed media filtration, is similar to that observed for E. coli (removal of \u223c99%) [7\u2022].",

The organisms are found in natural waters and drinking water distribution systems throughout the United States at concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 45 000/100 ml [3]. An outbreak in a hospital among immunocompromised individuals was traced to the chlorinated drinking water supply [14]. Recent research has demonstrated this organism to be the most resistant non-spore-forming bacteria to all disinfectants commonly used to treat drinking water [7\u2022].

At a minimum, all drinking water from surface supplies in the United States must receive at least filtration and disinfection [4\u2022]. Although coagulation can reduce the concentration of pathogenic microorganisms, filtration and disinfection are the primary barriers. Filtration is the main barrier for the removal of waterborne protozoan parasites and enteric pathogenic bacteria. Virus removal is enhanced by coagulation, but filtration cannot be totally relied upon because of the small size of viruses. Thus, disinfection becomes the main barrier for viruses. Use of membranes (e.g. ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) in the water treatment processes can cause large reductions in all classes of pathogens, but are not absolute barriers for pathogen removal. Herath et al.\n[34] observed that coliphage removal by microfiltration was related to the isoelectric point, with greatest removal near the isoelectric point of the virus.",

Parvoviruses also have the lowest known isoelectric point of enteric viruses, which would be expected to reduce their potential to be removed by filtration. Although a 99.6% reduction of M. avium and E. intestinalis can be expected by mixed media filtration, they are fairly resistant to disinfectant processes. In the case of M. avium any organisms reaching the distribution system have the ability to grow, because of their resistance to disinfectants [35].",

The effectiveness of these processes depends upon the nature of the surface chemistry of the adsorbent and the microorganism. The degree of interaction of these two types of particulates is governed by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The surfaces of most filtration media and microorganisms are characterized by a net negative charge, which explains the poor removal of most viruses by filter media: enteric viruses can vary greatly in both their isoelectric point and hydrophobicity [36\u2022]. Dowd et al.\n[9] demonstrated that virus transport through soils was dependent upon both the size and isoelectric point of viruses: the smaller the virus and lower the isoelectric point the less virus retention. This was also proven to be the case in field studies in a sand and gravel aquifer [37]. The hydrophobicity of the virus might also have a role, depending upon ionic conditions 36.\u2022, 38..",

Likewise, viruses with single-stranded nucleic acids of high molecular weight are easier to inactivate than those with single-stranded nucleic acids of low molecular weight; this is presumably because the target density is higher in larger genomes. Viruses with double-stranded genomes are less susceptible than those with single-stranded genomes, because naturally occurring enzymes within the host cell are able to repair damaged sections of the double-stranded genome, using the non-damaged strand as a template [42].
