For dry/gel swabs, the swabs were preprocessed in 500 l of 1\u03eb-PBS, 200 l of which was used for extraction as described above. For cerebrospinal fluid specimens, 200 l of cerebrospinal fluid was directly used for extraction. For sputum specimens, 250 l of sputum was resuspended with 500 l of 1% N-acetylcysteine in 1\u03eb-PBS, before RNA extraction from 200 l of the suspension. For all sample types, the extracted viral RNA was eluted into a final volume of 60 l of elution buffer.

It was then used as part of our influenza A/H1N1/2009 diagnostic strategy, alongside universal influenza A 16 After RNA extraction, all samples were screened for influenza A viruses of human, avian, and swine origin, influenza B virus, and the pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 simultaneously. For samples with detected influenza A, but tested negative for the pandemic strain, further seasonal influenza A subtyping rRT-PCR assays (to human H1 or H3 viruses) ensued. All four screening and subtyping assays used in our diagnostic suite were from previously published literature (as above) and were optimized to conform to our laboratory setting (eg, instrument/platform availability). A small but important modification was made to Spackman's universal influenza A assay 16 with the inclusion of an additional reverse primer, M124R\u0408 5\u0408-TGCAAAGACACTTTCCAG-TCTCTG-3\u0408, to enhance the detection of swine-origin influenza virus (Table 1) . 16, 17 The CDC's Emergency Use Authorization assay was run in parallel for the first 100 influenza A/H1N1/2009 positive samples during the initial clinical validation of our in-house assay.",

The slope of the standard curve, which describes the kinetics of the PCR amplification and indicates how quickly the amount of target nucleic acid can be expected to increase with the amplification cycles, is related to as the efficiency of the amplification reaction. To determine the interassay reproducibility, 15 replicates of the six-point, 10-fold serially diluted NP and HA RNA transcripts (5 \u03eb 10 2 to 5 \u03eb 10 7 copies per PCR) were prepared in equivalent copy numbers for the NP and HA gene segments and analyzed in 15 consecutive batch runs by two different operators. After adequate validation, the qRT-PCR was used to measure the viral loads in 286 clinical specimens on two separate occasions, by two different operators so as to determine the reproducibility of the qRT-PCR assay in clinical specimens.

Of these, there were 20 influenza B, 17 seasonal H1 influenza A, 143 seasonal H3 influenza, and 943 cases of A/H1N1/2009 virus infection (see Table 2 ). The first 100 positive cases of A/H1N1/2009 detected by the dual-gene duplex assay gave a 100% concordance with the CDC method. The assay appears to be highly specific for the pandemic influenza A variant, in the presence of seasonal influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B subtypes-none of the samples showing positivity for either seasonal influenza A or influenza B gave a positive result with the dual-gene assay. There were, however, six HA-only and 16 NP-only positive results (of the total 943 cases of A/H1N1/2009-positives), which were found in patients who were shown to be infected by the pandemic influenza strain by a sister laboratory that used another laboratory-developed method of their own (unpublished data). All 22 cases were found to be patients on post-antiviral treatment follow-up, with low viral titers (detection threshold \u03fe35 cycles), where virus detection probably became stochastic at the later stages of viral shedding. When such a scenario arose, we would repeat the assay and in the event that the repeats were consistently discrepant, we used our backup assay (the CDC EUA assay) to provide the correct result. In our hands, the dual-gene duplex assay had clinically validated sensitivity of 97.7% and specificity of 100%, based on 943 cases, positively infected with influenza A/H1N1/2009, and a rapid turnaround time of about 2.5 hours from sample receipt to result output. Figure 2 , A and B shows the standard amplification curves of both the NP and HA RNA transcripts in duplicates. The lower limit of detection for both NP and HA targets, defined as the lowest dilution with reproducible amplification, was 50 copies per PCR. The PCR efficiencies were 1.818 for the NP gene target and 1.772 for the HA gene. Boxplots, drawn using the amplification curve threshold cycle (Ct) values of each NP-and HA-serially diluted RNA transcript controls (six points for each gene) performed in 15 separate runs are shown in Figure 3 , A and B. Percentage coefficient of variation (CV%) and SD of each control level were derived to assess the interassay imprecision and gave an overall CV% of \u03fd3.5% and SD of \u03fd1.5 for all six points. The best fit line and 95% confidence interval against the calculated mean were drawn using the Ct values of the 15 consecutive separate runs, showing an R 2 value of 0.988 for both NP and HA (Figure 3, C and D) .",

This in-house dual-gene rRT-PCR assay targeted a region in the HA gene segment that could reliably discriminate influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus from other influenza A(H1) strains (both human and swine) and influenza B. As the HA gene is known to have a relatively high mutation rate, which may cause primer/probe mismatches and a subsequent loss of assay sensitivity, a second region on the more conserved internal NP gene was also targeted in the design of the dual-gene assay. The region targeted in the NP gene is common to only swine-origin influenza, increasing the specificity and confirmation of this assay against influenza A/H1N1/2009 from other human seasonal influenza.",

Unlike with previous pandemic influenza viruses, which displaced the previous seasonal influenza strains to become the current predominant circulating strain 18 , there appears to be a recent sporadic resurgence of seasonal influenza H3 and B viruses in certain parts of the world \u0353World Health Organization: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. update 98, http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 2010_04_30a/en/index.html, last accessed 2 July, 2010\u0354.

In addition, the quantitative capability of this assay for viral load measurements enables better monitoring for drugresistant influenza A/H1N1/2009 mutations, which are beginning to evolve in some infected patients post-treatment (eg, oseltamivir resistant influenza A/H1N1/2009, with probable human-to-human transmission, was first reported on November 20, 2009 19 ) . A recent study describing the natural viral load profile of the pandemic virus reported a reduction rate of 0.638 log 10 copies/ml/day (post symptom onset) in patients who received oseltamivir within two days of symptom onset versus \u03ea0.409 log 10 copies/ml/day in those who did not receive treatment, and viral load was undetectable by the day 7 of oseltamivir treatment. 20 Observation of persistently high viral load in a clinically suspicious or oseltamivir-treated patient would suggest the presence of the drug-resistant A/H1N1/2009 mutant and may warrant further identification study. 20 In this context, this dual-gene duplex rRT-PCR assay in both its qualitative and quantitative modes, offers a robust, sensitive, and specific option for detection and quantitative viral load determination of the influenza A/H1N1/2009 variant.",
