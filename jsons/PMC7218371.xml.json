For example, as seen in the paper, for T1bN0 glottic and palliative hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, a majority already use hypofractionated schedules in normal times. In response to panelists\u2019 feedback, we acknowledged that it is \u201cimportant to recognize the continuum between the early and late [pandemic] scenarios,\u201d where \u201cshorter fractionation schemes and the omission of concurrent chemotherapy [may need to] be considered prior to the actual onset of severely reduced capacity.\u201d This paragraph\u2014and this discussion\u2014allude to the complexities of defining a given situation as \u201cresource-constrained\u201d or not, and we might point out that resource constraints exist in many regions independent of pandemic conditions. The COVID-19 crisis has called attention to the importance of managing all experiences of resource shortage using the best clinical judgment and evidence available.",

Our primary author is a contributor to the Royal College of Radiologists guidelines,4 which were considered. Radiobiological modeling was not our focus, but the assertion that head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has a lower than accepted \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio is a hypothesis that would require additional formal evaluation.",
