During September 2014, Brazil experienced acute outbreaks of snout and coronary band vesicular lesions and sudden neonatal death loss, both of short duration, on sow farms (Vannucci et al., 2015). SV\u2010A was identified by real\u2010time reverse\u2010transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT\u2010PCR) and by in situ hybridization in tissues and vesicles from affected piglets (Vannucci, 2015). SV\u2010A has also been described as vesicular disease in pigs of all ages (pre\u2010weaning, nursery, finishing and breeding stock) in Brazil on February 2015 (Leme et al., 2015).

Sows were reported to be producing milk and did not have abnormal vaginal discharge, mastitis or lameness. Based on the clinical signs described by the producer, the clinical syndrome appeared to be affecting mainly neonatal piglets. The top differential diagnoses were porcine respiratory and reproductive virus (PRRSV) or porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). The farm was documented in February 2015 as PRRSV positive and unstable. There was no history of PEDV on this farm.",

For these concurrent cases, rRT\u2010PCR testing results for FMDV, swine vesicular disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and vesicle exanthema of swine virus performed at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) at Plum Island were all negative. In this case, the state veterinarian did not request a foreign animal disease investigation. Therefore, samples were not sent to the FADDL for additional vesicular disease testing. Samples were tested negative for FMDV by rRT\u2010PCR performed at ISU VDL, one of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network laboratories approved for presumptive FMDV PCR testing by USDA.",

In Brazil, epidemic transient neonatal losses, a clinical syndrome in piglets similar to the case presented here, resulted in necropsied piglets with no specific gross or histopathologic lesions (Vannucci et al., 2015). Vannucci (2015) was able to demonstrate SV\u2010A within the spleen, liver and vesicles of affected piglets using in situ hybridization. Furthermore, another report from Brazil also described the association of abundant quantity of SV\u2010A RNA and vesicular lesions in pigs (Leme et al., 2015). From our case and the Brazilian cases, other causes of neonatal mortality were examined and ruled out. Further research is needed to understand whether SV\u2010A is a primary cause of these conditions. Although virus has been identified in neonatal tissues of affected pigs, lesions are generally absent and Koch's postulates for neonatal mortality caused by SV\u2010A have not been satisfied (Vannucci, 2015).",

Specifically, colostrum and milk were not sampled. It would be of value to compare SV\u2010A viraemia in affected and non\u2010affected piglets and sows to generate evidence for the association between the SV\u2010A and neonatal mortality. Without a clear case definition and a small number of farrowings during the outbreak, it was challenging to select appropriate samples with significant sample size for a meaningful comparison. Lastly, the collection of samples in close proximity to the start of the outbreak would have provided better sample specimens and additional information to better characterize the outbreak in real time.",

There is a need of further studies to clarify the role of SV\u2010A on the development of vesicular disease and/or epidemic transient neonatal mortality in pigs. Animal caretakers and veterinarians must remain vigilant for vesicular foreign animal diseases and report clinical signs and lesions to the designated state animal health authority for diagnostic testing and further investigation.
