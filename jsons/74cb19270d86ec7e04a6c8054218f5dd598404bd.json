The World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease Project concluded that \"A total of 390,000 cases of cancer are attributable to alcohol drinking worldwide, representing 3.6% of all cancers (5.2% in men, 1.7% in women)\" each year, with a corresponding annual mortality rate of 233,000, representing 3.5% of all cancer deaths (Boffetta et al. 2006) .

More recent studies use large meta-analyses and scaling to control for spurious associations such as heavier drinkers also being heavier smokers. The data presented in Table 3 .1 (Hashibe et al. 2009 ) are typical of these studies (see also Ansary-Moghaddam et al. 2009 ) pooling over 11,000 cases and 16,000 controls to evaluate alcohol-tobacco interactive effects on UADT cancers. Note that \"alcohol alone\" failed to increase the odds ratio (OD) for any of the subsites or for UADT cancers as a whole. By contrast, there is a consistent synergistic effect between smoking and drinking for each of the three cancers included in the study. Using the combined data for \"Head and neck cancer overall\" as an example, in the presence of tobacco use the added effect of alcohol increased the odds ratio (OR) from 2.37 to 5.73, which indicates a tripling the number of added cancer cases (from a 137% increase over baseline to a 473% increase over baseline). The statistical significance term y > 1 indicates a joint effect greater than expected under a multiplicative model (Hashibe et al. 2009 ). Hashibe et al. (2009) go on to calculate the population attributable risk (PAR) for each condition thereby providing estimates of the impact of each risk factor, including interactions, in terms of the fraction (%) of the population affected. Again using overall data, the percentage of cancers attributable to alcohol-alone was 4.0% and to smoking-alone was 33.0%; and the portion attributable to the interaction was 34.9%, which suggests the total PAR for alcohol (also called the alcohol-attributable fraction, AAF) is 38.9%. Or looking at it another way, while the tobacco-attributable fraction is 67.9%, half of that is dependent on alcohol.",

Alcohol consumption, including the category with an intake of \u00b37 units/week exhibited no impact on rates for UADT cancers if the women were \"never smokers\". If, however, women were current smokers then even the lowest intake category (\u00a32 units/week) exhibited increased risk (RR = 2.54) for UADT cancers. And women smokers consuming 3-6 units/ week had a 3.57-fold increase in UADT cancers compared to nonsmokers. Since each unit = 10 g of ethanol, this means that intake less that 20 g/week, that is 1 \u00bd drinks per week (where one drink equals 14 g of ethanol, NIAAA 2007) is sufficient to more than double the risk for cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract. This magnitude of sensitization caused by smoking raises the question whether consumption of alcohol in a range otherwise deemed safe may in fact carry a significant risk if a sensitizing cofactor is also present.",

Table 3 .3 summarizes the main results of three studies (Donato et al. 2002; Hassan et al. 2002; Yuan et al. 2004) . Relatively high alcohol consumption (greater than 4 drinks per day) increased the odds ratios (ORs) to 2.6, 7.0, or 8.0 in the three studies in the absence of viral hepatitis. But a remarkably greater effect occurs when alcohol acts in concert with HBV or HCV, yielding odds ratios for HCC 48, 54, and 109-fold above baseline, respectively. This observation illustrates that the synergistic impact of alcohol on HCC can far outweigh its independent effects (i.e., effects occurring in the absence of other risk factors). Moreover, the combination of alcoholic liver disease and HCV occurs in a significant portion of patients with liver disease (Singal and Anand 2007) , which suggests a frequently underestimated contribution to HCC (Mueller et al. 2009 ).",

In Japan, the incidence of HCC is decreasing in younger people, although mortality rates lag behind, reflecting the acquisition of HCV several decades earlier (Tanaka et al. 2008 One factor contributing to this increase in liver cancer is that it is the result of the increasing impact of viral hepatitis (mainly HCV) during the 1990s (El-Serag and Mason 2000; El-Serag et al. 2004) . Even so, the majority of hepatocellular cancer patients in the USA (55-78%) remained seronegative for both HCV and HBV Hassan et al. 2002; Davila et al. 2004 ) and separate CDC data indicate that there has been a multifold decrease in the incidence of HBV and HCV acute hepatitis since the early 1980s (Daniels et al. 2009 ).

An increased relative risk of 7% per unit (or 10% per 14 g drink) may appear modest compared to values cited above, but breast cancer occurs very frequently and many women drink moderately. It is this combination that results in a large health burden, with breast cancer accounting for estimated 60% of all alcohol-attributable cancers in women (Boffetta et al. 2006 ).",

Thus, for women whose mother or sister had breast cancer there was a 12% rate increase per unit consumed. And for nonwhite women or women from developing countries, the effect of alcohol was not significant (Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer 2002). Perhaps surprisingly, risk factors with known independent effects on breast cancer rates, such as parity, excess BMI, use of hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy did not exhibit interactions with alcohol (Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer 2002). While other smaller studies have documented alcohol-HRT interactions for breast cancer; some are based on the absence of an HRT effect among women who do not drink or an alcohol effect only among \"never users\" of HRT (Colditz et al. 1990; Gapstur et al. 1992; Terry et al. 2006) .",

However, reviews of this literature include both positive and negative studies (Seitz and Cho 2009 ). Examples of positive studies include the large NHANES follow-up study (NHEFS) that found the RR for colon cancer was 1.69 (Su and Arab 2004) , and a pooled analysis of eight cohort studies indicated a RR = 1.41 for subjects drinking more than 45 g/day (Cho et al. 2004 ), but with no indication of gender differences or specific beverage effects. Finally, two recent reports came to different conclusions. While a large prospective study in Europe concluded that alcohol consumption was not associated with CRC ), a large meta-analysis of 103 cohort studies concluded the pooled RR for alcohol-associated CRC was 1.56 (1.42-1.79), which was about twice that of other significant lifestyle factors including, diabetes, consumption of red meat, obesity, or smoking ). Finally, it has been suggested that additional confounding effects for CRC may be associated with diet (Larsson et al. 2005) or the microbiome resident in the GI tract (Seitz and Cho 2009; Koivisto and Salaspuro 1998) . It is anticipated that an understanding of these additional factors may help resolve apparent discrepancies in the existing literature.",

            "text": "Recent US data indicate that thyroid cancer is diagnosed in about 22,000 individuals each year with a relative low mortality rate of about 1,600 (ACS Table, 2009 ). Thyroid cancer is unusual in several ways: First, it is one of the few cancers with a significantly higher incidence rate (2.7-fold) in women than in men (i.e., other than breast and female reproductive system cancers, ACS Table, 2009 ). Second, very few risk factors have been identified for thyroid cancer, and those that have been identified are uncharacteristic of other cancers (iodine deficiency and childhood exposure to ionizing radiation, Dal ). Finally, the risk for thyroid cancer is decreased with alcohol consumption especially in women (Nagano et al. 2007; Mack et al. 2003) . In the Million Women Study, alcohol reduced the incidence of thyroid cancer by nearly 50% (RR = 0.54, p < 0.005; Allen et al. 2009 ). The National Cancer Institute's NIH-AARP study confirmed a protective effect due to alcohol (RR = 0.57, p < 0.01) with two or more drinks per day and also indicated that beer was more effective than wine or distilled spirits (Meinhold et al. 2009 ). Finally, thyroid cancer may not be unique, since several sources including the Million Women Study also found decreased incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 0.77, p = 0.001) and renal cell carcinoma (RR = 0.66, p = 0.03) associated with alcohol consumption.",

Note that the AAF data approximate those in Table 3 .1 (Hashibe et al. 2009 ), which explicitly takes into account tobacco-alcohol interactions on UADT cancers. The fifth and sixth columns of Table 3 .4 are calculated for males and females, which are then summed and compared to the ARDI data cited in the Introduction. The total alcohol-attributable cancer deaths per year are calculated to be 16,433, which is much greater than the number (2,464) provided in the ARDI report (CDC 2010) and does not include prostate cancer or \"other neoplasms\" for which there were missing data cells. This sixfold difference raises the question whether an incomplete accounting of alcohol's synergistic effects may have led to underestimations of alcohol's total impact on cancer deaths in the USA.",

Drinking is also a significant risk factor for breast cancer in women especially in developed countries. Among men, alcohol is a significant risk factor for CRC and for nonadvanced prostate cancer. Epidemiological evidence emphasizes the observation that while alcohol is an independent risk factor for cancer, it also interacts with other major risk factors including viral hepatitis B and C, smoking and obesity, and that these interactions are typically synergistic.",
