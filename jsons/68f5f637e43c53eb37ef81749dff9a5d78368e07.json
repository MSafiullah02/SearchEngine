            "text": "Highly infectious diseases (HIDs) are defined as viral and bacterial infections that are easily transmissible, cause serious life-threatening illness, have no or few treatment options, and pose a threat to the general public. 8 Patients suspected or confirmed to be infected by HIDs require care in isolation rooms or specialized biocontainment areas in hospitals to prevent exposure of healthcare workers, visitors, and other patients to the person with the HID. 9 Standard and transmissionbased isolation precautions to prevent contact with the patient and their droplet secretions (eg, mucus from sneezing or coughing) include the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, masks, gowns, and eye protection. 10, 11 In addition to the use of PPE, airborne transmission-based precautions include special air-handling and ventilation systems, such as negative-pressure airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs), to prevent the dissemination of airborne droplet nuclei or small particles to areas where noninfected individuals are present, and to remove airborne pathogens by air filtration. 10, 11 When a patient infected with a respiratory pathogen coughs or sneezes, thousands of droplets are expelled, ranging in size from ~0.05 to 500 \u03bcm; the majority of these particles range in size from 10 to 100 \u03bcm. 12, 13 The smaller range of droplets can rapidly desiccate to form droplet nuclei (ie, particles \u22645 \u03bcm in diameter) that can contain infectious pathogens. [11] [12] [13] [14] Droplet nuclei are assumed to have such low settling velocities that this results in extended airborne suspension times, on the order of hours, resulting in particle transport over long distances (eg, >1 m). 12, 15 This long-distance aerosol dissemination is mainly determined by airflow patterns in the built environment as generated by ventilation systems and movement of personnel. 15 Previous research has illustrated the potential for widespread airborne dissemination within a hospital driven by the building's air ventilation systems, including nosocomial outbreaks of MERS and SARS. 16, 17 One type of specialized healthcare environment, a clinical biocontainment unit (BCU), is designed to care for patients infected with HIDs and incorporates specialized environmental controls and isolation protocols to prevent pathogen transmission. In response to the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, Johns Hopkins Medicine created a BCU by redesigning and renovating existing clinical space. 18 The Johns Hopkins BCU (JH-BCU), along with nine others around the United States, were funded by the",

The goal was to develop a safe and effective method that could be used by BCUs to evaluate potential failure points of PPE to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious particles. The objective of this study was to provide the first investigation of a BCU's ability to contain aerosolized simulant fluorescent pathogen particles under different F I G U R E 1 (A) An illustration of the Johns Hopkins Hospital biocontainment unit (JH-BCU) depicting room types. Red areas are the three patient rooms, labeled rooms 1-3, and the laboratory space for processing samples (room 4). There is a dedicated space for putting on personal protective equipment (PPE) (ie, donning) which is shared by patient rooms 1 and 2 (room 5), as well as a shared donning space between patient room 3 and the laboratory (room 6). Each of the red spaces have areas for removal of PPE (ie, doffing), labeled as the yellow rooms 7-10. Area 11 is a nurses' station. All green areas do not require the use of PPE according to the JH-BCU standard protocols while red areas do require PPE. For more details, see Garibaldi et al 18 (B) Overview of the JH-BCU space with the number of air changes per hour per room during normal HVAC (heating, ventilation, air-conditioning) operation, and the directional movement of personnel between spaces to minimize risk for contamination of clean zones (arrows). (C) Locations in the JH-BCU for the release of fluorescent tracer particles from the Collison nebulizer (\"CN\" in figure), and eight IBAC (Instantaneous Biological Analyzer and Collector, FLIR Systems) sensors for detecting and measuring fluorescent particle concentrations and dissemination pattern. The IBAC locations in order include: (1) patient room, (2) PPE doffing room, (3-6) hallway, (7) PPE donning room, and (8) nurses' station HVAC operating conditions. These experiments were conducted to investigate the airborne isolation capabilities of a JH-BCU patient room in the absence of any HCW movement or activity; that is, particle dissemination via airflow patterns alone. Considering the number of BCUs currently in operation (there are currently 11), the lack of formal guidelines for BCU safety controls, and the everpresent threat of naturally or intentionally spread HIDs, 23 there is a critical need for systematic research addressing the safety of BCU facilities and protocols. The methodologies presented below provide a testing framework that can be used across multiple BCU facilities and other indoor air environments to evaluate dispersion patterns and minimize the risk for exposure to and transmission of airborne pathogens.",

Figure 1B presents the overview of the JH-BCU space, the number of air changes per hour (ACH) per room (black numbers) during normal operation, and the relative directional flow of personnel between rooms to minimize the risk for contamination of clean spaces (arrows). The main goal of the air-handling system design is to maintain the contaminated spaces of the JH-BCU (ie, the patient rooms and laboratory) at negative pressure relative to the rest of the JH-BCU and the general hospital; this is intended to prevent aerosol escape from these rooms and removes airborne pathogens by filtration. 9 The JH-BCU uses the main hospital's building supply air, but the entire JH-BCU is operated under a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered exhaust system that is separate from the general exhaust system for the rest of the hospital building. The exhaust system has two fans to maintain negative pressure in the patient rooms and laboratory, and each of these fans can operate independently in the case that one fails. Only one fan runs at a given time to operate the connected total airflow to maintain the appropriate negative In this study, three repeat trials were conducted for both HVAC test conditions. The exhaust failure trials were conducted by coordinating with the facility manager to turn off the JH-BCU HEPA exhaust system. As described above, the exhaust system has two fans; both fans were off during the exhaust failure trials. According to the exhaust failure standard operating protocol of the JH-BCU, this results in automatic shut off of the building supply air to the areas of the JH-BCU that are assumed to be contaminated (ie, the three patient rooms, laboratory, and the dirty side of the autoclave room) in order to reduce further disruption of the pressure differentials. The air-handling system's automation system maximizes airflow to the clean areas of the JH-BCU by increasing supply air to these clean areas to push particles from the rest of the unit toward the contaminated areas. In addition, an emergency backup power supply provides power to ductless cooling/heating units in the patient rooms; these units can be operated by the staff to maintain air circulation and provide comfort. During the exhaust failure trial, the effect of turning off the ductless cooling/heating units in the patient room was also investigated to observe how this influenced particle dissemination and transport. a remote switch so that the pattern of particle dissemination was not disturbed by test operator movement. The suspension was replaced in the Collison nebulizer before every new repeat trial.

The particles were allowed sufficient time to desiccate to a core particle size in aerosol capacitance chambers, well-mixed using a high chamber flowrate (2500 L/min), and sampled isokinetically to measure particle size and number concentration using a UVAPS (Ultraviolet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, Model 3314, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA). While a Sono-Tek atomizer was used for chamber measurements, the Collison nebulizer was used during the JH-BCU experiments due to its ease of transport and setup. Also, since the experimental repeats conducted in the JH-BCU monitored particle dissemination for 20-min post-nebulization, chamber desiccation was used during the measurements of the suspension's particle number size distribution to mimic aerosol aging; thus, the nebulized particles were dried to a solid, core size to simulate droplet nuclei. 34 Further, as described below in results, nebulization of the fluorescent suspension by the Collison nebulizer during experiments at the JH-BCU was found to produce a particle number size distribution with 82.3% \u00b1 0.8% of the particles in the 0.5 to 1.7 \u03bcm size range.",

This represents a potential risk of airborne pathogen exposure for HCWs since respiratory PPE is removed in the doffing room and is not worn elsewhere in the JH-BCU, according to the JH-BCU protocols. For reference, Figure 1B illustrates which areas of the JH-BCU require the use of respiratory PPE (red zones), and Figure 1C illustrates the IBAC sensor locations. The yellow zones are where the PPE is removed, and the green zones are considered clean and do not require PPE. During the HVAC exhaust failure trials, tracer particles were detected outside of the patient room and in both yellow (doffing room, room #8 in Figure 1A , IBAC #2 in Figure 1C ) and green (hallway, IBAC #4 and #5 in Figure 1C) zones.",

The key difference between the present study and the study of Drewry et al 24 is that there were no HCWs in the present study; that is, particle dissemination was observed as a result of airflow patterns alone while manipulating HVAC condition. Therefore, the potential for HCW exposure to airborne pathogens is of concern in the doffing room due to multiple potential scenarios for this contamination. Thus far, between the present study and Drewry et al, 24 these identified scenarios include HVAC exhaust failure, re-aerosolization of particles deposited on the outside of HCW's PPE during doffing, and/or particle transport from the patient room after opening the door between the two spaces.",

The diagram indicates the following features: the relative locations for the doorways, direction of healthcare worker movement through these doors, patient bed and bathroom, HVAC (heating, ventilation air-conditioning) supply and exhaust vents, and the ductless cooling/heating units that staff utilize for comfort during an HVAC failure. The patient room has two exhaust vents which are located furthest from the doors and closest to the patient bed so that the net airflow of the patient room moves across the patient and exits while minimizing HCW exposure. This net airflow, illustrated by the blue arrow, has been qualitatively observed by the JH-BCU engineering team using smoke. The exhaust vents are each 0.3*0.2 m and approximately 0.3 m above the floor. The patient room has two supply air vents (0.2*0.2 m) located above two corridor doorways. These doors are not used when a patient is present and are taped off to alert HCWs not to enter/exit through these doors. Also depicted is the instrumentation used during experiments, including the IBAC sensor (FLIR Systems, Inc., Elkridge, MD) in the patient room (IBAC1) and the fluorescent particle release location from the 3-Jet Collison nebulizer (25 mL suspension, 138 kPa, 5 L/min; Mesa Laboratories, Inc., Butler, NJ). The room dimensions are as follows: length = 8.1 m, width = 5.4 m, height = 2.5 m (total room volume = 109.4 m 3 ) malicious use of infectious agents through bioterrorism, including variola virus, must be considered. 46, 47 Therefore, the identification for potential transport of the fluorescent tracer particles from the patient room to adjacent areas of the JH-BCU during HVAC failure warrants further investigation to identify methods and protocols that can be used during the emergency loss of negative pressure in the patient rooms. For example, during HVAC failure, the JH-BCU protocols can be updated to require the use of PPE and respirators in all areas of the unit. Future research will also investigate the potential for pathogen dissemination beyond the physical space of the JH-BCU into other areas of the hospital during different HVAC scenarios.",

On the other hand, the pressure differential between the patient room to the doffing space and the doffing space to the hallway corridor was close to zero (<\u22120.001 Pa to +0.05 Pa) ( Figure 5 ). This suggests that the exhaust failure emergency protocol of increasing airflow to the areas adjacent to the patient rooms was not sufficient enough to create a negative pressure differential between the doffing room and patient room.

Nevertheless, the influence of door cracks has been previously investigated as a means for particle transport from outdoors to indoors with particle penetration factor estimates of 0.8-1.0 for 1 \u03bcm diameter particles through window and door frame cracks in different types of buildings; the average air velocity through these cracks was estimated to be 0.3-2.2 m/s. 50 This is supported by laboratory studies which have also shown a penetration factor of 0.8-1.0 for 1 \u03bcm particles through horizontal cracks (0.5 mm high, 102 mm deep, 433 mm wide) under an applied pressure of 2 Pa across connected chambers. 51 Even though the pressure differential between the patient room and adjacent JH-BCU areas was less than that described in previous chamber studies, an air velocity of 1 m/s was observed in the present study moving in the direction out of the patient room through the cracks of the door handles which could facilitate particle transport (Velocicalc, Model 9515, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA).",

By shutting off the ductless cooling/heating unit, the time required for particles to transport from the patient room to the doffing space was increased by approximately 3 min ( Figure 7B ). It is hypothesized that the airflow of the ductless cooling/heating unit helped push particles into the doffing room when the patient room lost negative pressure.

The patient rooms and the laboratory space exceed the minimum recommendation of 12 ACH for adequately ventilated single rooms without controlled, directional airflow 11 ; the patient rooms each have 15 ACH, and the laboratory space has 32 ACH. Ductless supplemental cooling/heating units have been installed in each patient room, laboratory, and the dirty side of the autoclave room. These units are connected to the emergency backup power and are designed to provide additional cooling/heating to the areas in case of failure of the BCU central cooling and heating systems. The general airflow with respect to the BCU is from areas of higher to lower pressure which maps as (high to low): the surrounding hospital > the entire JH-BCU > rooms and laboratory are maintained at a negative pressure differential of at least \u22125 pascal (Pa) to the adjacent areas (PPE rooms and hallway). This is continuously monitored by 15 room pressure sensors-one at each of the entrances to BCU rooms (Pressura Model 8631-HM-BAC Room Pressure Monitor, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA). These sensors alarm if the negative pressure differential is diminished below the minimum of 2.5 Pa. 21 The room pressure (ie, airflow direction) at each room's doorway are continuously monitored and the averages are recorded every 10 min in a continuous log by the sensors. The average air velocity at the doorways can also be recorded using the same pressure monitors. While the JH-BCU space is not in use, the room pressures and pressure sensors are checked quarterly and the airflows are checked annually. Additionally, the airflows are also checked as needed during the quarterly room pressure checks. According to CDC recommended guidelines for maintaining continuous negative pressure conditions and airflow patterns of protective environment rooms, 25 airflows are checked ideally on a daily basis using a visual indicator (eg, flutter strips or smoke tubes). These are guidelines only, not requirements.A full description of the design and configuration of the JH-BCU is detailed in Garibaldi et al.18",

For example, in June 2001, Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, TX, a level I trauma center, lost electrical power, communications, and running water during tropical storm Allison. 30 During the 2012 SuperStorm Sandy, two hospitals in New York City were forced to evacuate, including Bellevue Hospital, after two days on backup generator power.31",

While the clean side of the doffing space is still considered potentially contaminated space according to JH-BCU protocols, HCWs are unprotected, as they have already doffed their PPE, including their respiratory protection. Regardless, during the given test scenario for which there were no HCWs present, there were no particles detected outside of the patient room suggesting that the lower pressure differential between the doffing space and hallway corridor may not result in the release of particles into the hallway space assuming that the doffing space acts as a buffer zone between the patient room and hallway. The complete containment of particles achieved in the patient room suggests that the locations and ventilation rates of the patient room exhaust vents were sufficient to maintain airborne isolation conditions under normal HVAC operation. The locations of inlet and exhaust air vents in the patient room with respect to the patient bed are illustrated inFigure 6. The exhaust vents are each 31*20 cm and approximately 31 cm above the floor. The patient room has two supply air vents (23*23 cm) located above two corridor doorways.",

However, practical limitations during the design and building process should also be considered; the inlet and outlet vent locations in the JH-BCU were selected in the patient room to be furthest from the doors and closest to the patient beds so that the net airflow of the patient room moves across the patient and then exits. It was also desired to locate the exhaust vents as far as practically possible from the donning and doffing room doors to remove particles away from these corridors to reduce the risk of particles entering into these spaces when the doors open. 43 Furthermore, in the present experiments in the JH-BCU under normal HVAC conditions, the exhaust vents appear to sufficiently remove released tracer particles.",

During normal HVAC operation, there were no fluorescent tracer particles detected outside of the patient room suggesting that the locations of and ventilation rates used by the patient room exhaust vents were sufficient to contain particles in the patient isolation room. For these tests, no HCWs were present and no patient care activities were performed. During HVAC exhaust failure, fluorescent tracer particles were detected in the areas adjacent to the patient room, including the doffing room and the hallway; ~6% of the fluorescent particles detected in the patient room were transported into the doffing space by airflow alone and not by HCW movement or opening/closing of doors. Thus, the HVAC automated response during exhaust failure to increase airflow to spaces adjacent to the patient rooms is not sufficient for maintaining negative pressure differentials and complete airborne isolation conditions. It is hypothesized that particles were transported from the patient room to adjacent areas of the BCU through cracks around the doors and door handles. Therefore, future research will further characterize particle sizedependent penetration factors through patient room doors under different HVAC operating conditions with monodispersed aerosols. It should be further investigated how to leak protect the doors and door handles. Future research should also investigate different placement locations for the ductless cooling/heating units in the patient room away from locations that may promote particle transport out of the patient room. Additionally, updated protocols are needed during the emergency loss of negative pressure in the patient rooms, such as required use of respiratory PPE in all areas of the JH-BCU. This would also require identification of an emergency PPE doffing space. Potential wider applications of this work include crosscomparison of the present JH-BCU airborne isolation capabilities to those of other BCUs throughout the country. There are 11 federally funded BCUs in the United States. However, there are no formal, mandated guidelines for BCU design, construction, and capabilities; therefore, specifications vary among the facilities. 8,22,23 The present study provides the first data examining the efficiency of a BCU environment to maintain isolation of released airborne particles. The methods used in the present study could be applied to evaluate the other BCUs with a focus on providing guidelines to standardize minimum BCU requirements for maintaining airborne isolation conditions. Additionally, the use of polydisperse, fluorescent tracer particles in combination with a networked array of real time, fluorescent aerosol sensors could be flexibly applied to other clinical spaces to investigate particle fate and transport throughout facilities. Because the fluorescent tracer particles used in this study (ie, optical brightener suspension) have been approved for release into public spaces, 32 this type of research could be conducted in both empty and occupied spaces to investigate the influence of patient and healthcare provider movement on pathogen simulant transport. This work could be coupled with and used for validation of numerical simulations to create a more complete picture of aerosol transport in any clinical space.
