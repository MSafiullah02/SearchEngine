Similarly, estimated prevalence of 437,822 patients requires home enteral nutrition in the United States (5). These patients regularly received invasive procedures, such as nasogastric tubes, Foley catheters, and tracheotomy tube replacements, and even infusion therapy, ventilator support, and hospice care.

At present, the Taiwan Center for Disease Control recommends that if the family members of disabled patients need home quarantine, a medical team should not go to the patient's home to provide services. However, we should approach this issue in a different way. We believe that if there is a disabled patient in a family, when their family members or caregivers are suspected to be infected by COVID-19 and need to be quarantined at home, they should not live together, and a quarantine hotel or another alternate space should be arranged.",

In Taiwan, many families employ carers from Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines to assist in daily care. Sometimes, a communication gap can result in a gap in infection surveillance, prevention, and control. Therefore, the government should prepare multilingual manuals for COVID-19 infection prevention. Most importantly, we need to give more support to carers to reduce the pressure on them.",

When performing invasive treatments such as the replacement of tracheostomy or nasogastric tubes, we recommend wearing a face mask and a protective gown to avoid being splattered by secretions. Moreover, at present, Taiwan is promoting mutual support among home care facilities. Once any member in any specific facility displays a high risk of COVID-19 infection, another home care team can quickly take over their services, reducing the risk of patients returning to the hospital for treatment.",

The dilemma is that many of them often have respiratory symptoms, fever, and a differential diagnosis in a home care setting is quite difficult at this time (8) . We recommend that if we could exclude them from possessing significant history of exposure to COVID-19, medical treatment should be provided for them at home as much as possible. At this time, the intervention of hospice home care is also important. In addition, we believe that the quantity and integration of primary care at this time must be heightened. If these patients can be taken care of in the community and their need for hospitalization can be reduced, the burden on the emergency and critical care units in the hospital can be greatly eased.",
