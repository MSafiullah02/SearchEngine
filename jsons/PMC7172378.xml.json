To infect epithelial cells, the virus must first penetrate the overlying mucus barrier, then bind to the cell surface \u2013 an interaction involving viral polypeptides or attachment proteins and cognate cell-surface receptors. DAS181 is the first antiviral compound in Phase II development that functions by blocking this pathogen\u2013host interaction, by destroying the influenza host-cell receptor, sialic acid (Sia), on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells. In this paper, we provide background information on Sia and sialidases; discuss the potential role of bacterial sialidases as antiviral agents; review the in vitro and Phase II evaluation of DAS181 for the treatment of influenza; and note evidence that the drug would also be useful against parainfluenza virus infections.",

Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors primarily act at this step, but they play a minor role in modulating viral entry (Matrosovich et al., 2004). The first step of viral binding often involves close contact between the viral attachment protein and host receptor. Before the development of DAS181, studies in the 1980s demonstrated that natural compounds present in serum, in particular alpha 2-macroglobulin, inhibited virus adsorption to surfaces (Hanaoka et al., 1989, Rogers et al., 1983). Later studies identified Sia as being the key determinant of binding for these compounds (Pritchett et al., 1987, Pritchett and Paulson, 1989). Lentz proposed a number of strategies to prevent cell entry by blocking the host receptor (Lentz, 1988, Lentz, 1990), but these were mainly directed at developing an antibody-mediated approach, rather than receptor destruction.",

With this structure solved, it was envisioned that it might be possible to develop synthetic analogs of Sia to block binding (Pritchett et al., 1987, Pritchett and Paulson, 1989), though it was acknowledged that such drug design would have a number of structural obstacles (Weis et al., 1988). This route of anti-influenza therapy was not pursued in as much detail as blocking the viral neuraminidase site, but there have been two recent reports on developing drug design by blocking the HA binding site, using databases of commercially available compounds (ZINC) (Li et al., 2011, Nandi, 2008) and other techniques (Al-qattan and Mordi, 2010a, Al-qattan and Mordi, 2010b, Blessia et al., 2010).",

To investigate this requires an understanding of the nature of Sia, its presence in the respiratory tract and the structure and function of bacterial sialidase. Sialic acid is the term used for a family of nine-carbon monoscaccharides found in animals and certain bacteria (Chen and Varki, 2010). They are typically found at the terminal portions of oligosaccharide chains attached to proteins and lipids to form glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively. There are over 40 naturally occurring variants of these nine-carbon keto-sugars based on a neuraminic acid (Neu) or a 2-keto-3-deoxynononic acid (Kdn) backbone (Schauer, 1973, Varki, 1997). The discovery of neuraminic acid by Klenk and colleagues has been reviewed by Schaeur (Schauer, 1973) with the term sialic acid proposed by Blix, Gottschalk and Klenk based on the Greek word sialion (salivea) as these carbohydrates were isolated from the mucin of submaxillary glands.",

            "text": "The diversity of Sia present in nature is due to the substitution at the 4\u20139 carbons by O-acetyl, sulfate, methyl and lactate groups and by glycosidic linkage by the anomeric C2 to the 3 or 6 hydroxyl group of galactose (Gal) (referred to as the \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6), N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) or N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) (Varki and Varki, 2007) (Fig. 1\n). Eleven different types of sialic acid have been identified on the human erythrocyte membrane, using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Bulai et al., 2003). GalNAc is typically present on O-glycans, and GlcNAc is normally a component of N-glycans. The binding of Sia to Gal or GalNAc requires a family of enzymes called sialyltransferases (ST), with each ST producing a specific linkage (Harduin-Lepers et al., 2005, Paulson and Rademacher, 2009, Xia et al., 2005). In some instances, multiple Sia may be linked together to form polysialic acid, most commonly in a \u03b12-8 configuration (Hildebrandt et al., 2010). The linkage of Sia to the adjacent sugar is in an \u03b1 configuration, which means the bond is acid-labile and is readily destroyed by enzymes known as sialidases. It should be noted that in solution, unbound Sia is mainly in the \u00df-configuration, with the C2 hydroxyl positioned axial to the ring and in equilibrium with the minor \u03b1-form (Vimr, 1994).",

The negatively-charged glycoproteins will mutually repel each other, allowing trapping of water molecules to produce a highly viscous aqueous solution that comprises the glycocalyx of many epithelial surfaces. The importance of this shield was highlighted by Varki and Varki, who indicated that >1% of the mammalian genome encodes proteins involved in this glycosylation pathway (Lehmann et al., 2006, Varki and Varki, 2007). The high Sia content of mucin acts as a lubricant for epithelial surfaces in the cornea, nasal mucosa, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and other tissues in contact with the environment. This mucin protects the cells against mechanical and chemical damage, such as gastric acid and digestive enzymes. The Sia content of mucin also functions as a decoy for pathogens that bind to Sia, such as respiratory viruses (Lehmann et al., 2006). The mucin is produced by goblet cells and normally is a benefit to the host (Nicholls et al., 2007). However, in certain diseases such as cystic fibrosis, changes in mucin composition allow increased bacterial growth and pathogenesis (Xia et al., 2005).",

The capping of terminal galactose by Sia masks the recognition of certain oligosaccharides by the asialoglycoprotein receptor of the liver (Grewal et al., 2008) or similar receptors present on macrophages. The sialylation of compounds allows plasma macromolecules to have a longer period of time in the circulation; the number of glycosylation sites is related to biological functions (Banks, 2011, Sun et al., 2011). Conversely, the half-life of many serum glycoproteins such as thyrotropin, erythropoietin, and follicle stimulating hormone is decreased upon desialylation. Glycosylation of proteins as a shield to prevent recognition is not limited to host factors, but is also employed by pathogens such as the influenza viruses, leading to the development of antigenic variation (Sun et al., 2011). Finally, the presence of Sia on glycans may also modulate the immune response, through recognition by Sia-binding lectins, now known as Siglecs. The first Siglec to be identified, sialoadhesin, was found on macrophages (O\u2019Neill et al., 2013), but more than 10 different Siglec molecules have since been discovered (reviewed in Varki and Gagneux (2012)).",

In the former situation, this occurs at C4 and C6\u20139 (Cao et al., 2009, Schauer et al., 2011) with identification of the enzyme sialate-O-acetyltransferase as a candidate recently identified (Arming et al., 2011). Modifications of Sia are important to consider, as these changes, in particular O-acetylation, may have an effect on enzymatic cleavage by sialidases. Schauer demonstrated that the position of acetylation has an effect on sialidase activity: an O-acetyl group on C8 reduces cleavage by 40% and at C4 by about 80% (Schauer, 1973). Bacteria and some viruses (notably influenza C virus and coronaviruses) have circumvented this protective mechanism through the development of esterases located in the cytosol or in lysozymes. Although influenza C virus appeared to lack sialidase activity, it was still able to agglutinate red blood cells from certain species, which led to the finding of an esterase combined with the haemagglutinin and fusion protein to form the HEF that is present on influenza C and some coronaviruses (Martin et al., 2003).",

The tissue localization of the 9-O-acetylation variant has been investigated by the use of specific monoclonal antibodies (Argueso and Sumiyoshi, 2006), or binding by influenza C virus or its recombinant soluble form, coupled with the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Che-FcD) (Mandal et al., 2000). These studies showed that O-acetylation of sialic acid in humans appears localized to the suprabasal plasma membranes of cells exposed to a \u201cwet\u201d surface, such as the cornea, conjunctiva, laryngeal and vaginal epithelium. There is a variation in the degree of O-acetylation between ethnic backgrounds, depending on whether individuals are slow or fast acetylators. Apart from the sialidase from Arthrobacter urefaciens, Actinomyces viscosus and to a lesser extent the sialidase from Newcastle disease virus, other sialidases are apparently not effective at cleaving the terminal sialic acid. The O-acetylation inhibits sialidase sterically, and is not competitive. Thus, O-acetylation of mucins can protect against the action of bacterial sialidases. This O-acetlyation is conspicuous on the terminal aspect of MUC16, a glycoprotein with a long extracellular domain that prevents infection of the intact epithelium.",

Many studies by Ajit Varki and colleagues have shown a high expression of this enzyme in many animal species. Humans lack CMAH activity and the only source of Neu5Gc is from the diet. This additional oxygen is important from a sialidase point of view in that many bacterial and viral sialidases preferably cleave Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc in the \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 configuration (Davies et al., 2012). Viral sialidases from Newcastle disease virus, fowl plague and most influenza viruses also show poor cleavage of Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac.

In the case of enzymatic cleavage of Neu5Gc, this enzymatic cleavage is unlikely to be a major concern, because of the lack of CMAH enzyme in humans, and thus the mucin is exclusively Neu5Ac.

As viruses replicate intracellularly, it follows logically that successful attachment to the cell requires a matching up of the receptor with the pathogen. This is often a two-step process: first, a low-affinity \u201cbrowsing\u201d, followed by a higher-affinity interaction with the virus, and more specific receptor interactions (Helander et al., 2003). An extensive list of viruses that utilize Sia and which may infect the respiratory tract has been reviewed by Lehmann and colleagues (Lehmann et al., 2006). Even though influenza virus has been the most well characterized of the pathogens studied, it must be noted that other viruses, including cytomegalovirus (Taylor and Cooper, 1989), rhinovirus 87 (Blomqvist et al., 2002), mumps Urabe AM9 (Reyes-Leyva et al., 2007) and the paramyxoviruses all utilize Sia (Suzuki et al., 2001) (Paulson et al., 1979), suggesting that sialidase treatment may potentially be useful for these infections.",

The synthesis of Sia in bacteria is limited to a few, mostly pathogenic species that incorporate Sia into surface structures, such as the capsular polysialic acid found in Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli K1 (Plumbridge and Vimr, 1999). The Sia that is incorporated or synthesized is used as a growth factor or a source of carbon (Kim et al., 2011, Stafford et al., 2012, Vimr et al., 2004). Bacteria that utilize Sia include Neisseria, Haemophilus, Bacteroides, Fusobacteria and Streptococci. To achieve this scavenger effect, a bacterium first require a sialidase to remove the Sia from the host environment, then enzymes for catabolism, followed by uptake into the bacterium for utilization. The latter two steps will not be elucidated further, but an excellent review on these processes is available (Vimr et al., 2004). Another outcome of the sialylation of bacterial surfaces is similar to that mentioned above for viruses, in that they are able to avoid recognition by the host defense mechanisms, as sialylation results in recognition as \u201cself\u201d rather than \u201cforeign\u201d.",

The sialidases of S. pneumoniae may expose host receptors and desialylate host glycoproteins such as lactoferrin and immunoglobulin that clear bacteria. They may also lead to the desialylation of the lipopolysaccharides of other bacteria such as N. meningitidis and Haemophilus influenza, giving the pneumococcus a competitive growth advantage (Pettigrew et al., 2006). The NanA is cell surface-anchored, and functions in adherence. It may also provide a carbon source for the bacterium. Similar to many other bacterial sialidases, NanB is secreted as an extracellular enzyme and implicated in the severity of pneumococcal infection (Manco et al., 2006).",

It has been well recognized that patients with influenza are susceptible to secondary bacterial infection (van der Sluijs et al., 2006), and the high mortality of the 1918 influenza pandemic has been attributed to secondary infections (Brundage and Shanks, 2008). If sialidase is to be used as a prophylactic or therapeutic strategy, there have therefore been concerns that this may lead to increased bacterial adherence and secondary bacterial pneumonia (Zhang, 2008). In reality, increased adherence is due to epithelial necrosis and exposure of the basement membranes as a result of viral-induced cell death (Plotkowski et al., 1986), rather than surface-induced desialylation, which was not associated with epithelial cell death (Nicholls et al., 2008).",

It is even possible for the same bacteria to have different specificities: the NanA of S. pneumonia can cleave \u03b12-3, \u03b12-6 or \u03b12-8 linkages, but the extracellular NanB prefers a substrate with the \u03b12-3 linkage. The broad range of specificities has been attributed to a number of mechanisms, including the configuration of the active site and the role of water molecules as nucleophiles. The crystal structure of NanB has been used to demonstrate \u03b12-3 cleavage specificity, proposing that an additional rim of residues above the arginine triad may only allow an \u03b12-3 configuration to bind (Gut et al., 2008).",

Achieving this would require a number of properties. The first is that an effective sialidase would need to have a broad catalytic activity, because with agents such as influenza virus, binding is dependent on the linkage between the Sia and galactose. The first evidence of this in influenza was demonstrated by Rogers and Paulson, who desialylated red blood cells, then re-sialylated them using specific sialyltransferases that were either \u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6 linked (Rogers and Paulson, 1983). Avian or equine viruses agglutinated the former, while human and swine viruses agglutinated the latter. From these studies the paradigm emerged that avian viruses were primarily \u03b12-3 binding and human and swine viruses were \u03b12-6 binding (Wilks et al., 2012). As ducks and waterfowl contain mainly \u03b12-3 terminated Sia in their intestines, there would be little selection pressure for avian viruses to acquire \u03b12-6 binding, and cross-species transmission would require a number of mutations.",

Lectin binding studies have shown that \u03b12-6 and \u03b12-3 N-linked sialic acids are distributed throughout the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans, with an increased distribution of \u03b12-3 O-linked sialic acids in the lower respiratory tract (Nicholls et al., 2007).

If a sialidase were administered systemically, this could lead to widespread desialylation of glycoproteins and suppression of the Siglec pathways. For instance, since erythrocytes are removed from the circulation once they are desialylated, it has been proposed that systemic sialidase treatment might result in widespread erythrophagocytosis (Biondi et al., 2002, Bratosin et al., 1998). Furthermore, as many viral respiratory pathogens infect both the upper and lower respiratory tract, including the alveoli, the sialidase would need to be in an aerosolized or nebulized form, to allow even distribution throughout the airway. Finally, a mechanism for retention in the extracellular environment, avoiding rapid catabolism, would be advantageous for effective pharmacokinetics.",

One of its features is an epidermal-growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is homologous with other members of the EGF-like growth factor family, meaning that it can bind to the EGF receptor present on epithelial cells. Unlike many other members of the EGF family, amphiregulin binding does not lead to EGFR degradation, but to recycling of the receptor and continued accumulation at the surface (Willmarth et al., 2009). At the other end of the protein is a heparin- and glycosaminoglycan-binding domain, which is involved in the inhibition or transformation of this glycoprotein (hence the name amphi-regulin). In the case of DAS181, the sialidase was combined with the GAG-binding portion of human AR. By binding to the negatively-charged glycosaminoglycans on the surface of airway epithelial cells, the cationic C-terminal amphiregulin tag anchors DAS181 on the respiratory epithelium, improving its potency. This net effect of combining the sialidase with amphiregulin means that the sialidase will be targeted to epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, but without activating the EGFR pathway.",

Minimal but significant decreases in red blood cells, haematocrit and hemoglobin were identified, together with an increased reticulocyte count, in keeping with a mild anemia; systemic absorption from the respiratory tract was estimated at 2% (Larson et al., 2011). In this study there was also a 3-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) from the liver, which was attributed to diminished clearance, owing to competition for the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The rise in ALP was not associated with any evidence of hepatotoxicity.

The interaction between influenza virus infection and secondary pneumonia is a complex one that has been investigated by McCullers and others (Grijalva and Griffin, 2012, Iverson et al., 2011, Karlstrom et al., 2011). Since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic, there has been an association of increased bacterial infection following influenza infection. The recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic was associated with an increase in invasive pneumococcal infection (Nelson et al., 2012), suggesting that pneumococcal vaccination should be included as a vaccine strategy in future pandemics. Indeed, vaccination strategies using pneumococcal vaccination reduced the incidence of influenza-associated pneumonia. However, the link between influenza and pneumococcal infection has been complicated by the finding that not all pneumococcal serotypes are associated with secondary pneumonia, and that influenza virus infection may select out and favor the growth of particular serotypes (McCullers et al., 2010). It has been proposed that the desialylation produced by the viral neuraminidase exposes receptors that allow increased binding by pneumococci, followed by invasion. As we pointed out previously, a clear distinction needs to be made between desialylation in viral infection and that induced by topical therapy (Nicholls et al., 2008).",

Studies by Hedlund and colleagues using DAS181 showed that, in contrast to expectations, desialylation appeared to protect mice against secondary bacterial colonization (Hedlund et al., 2010). Also, in a study previously cited, there was no evidence of increased adherence of pneumococci to desialylated tracheal epithelial specimens (Nicholls et al., 2008). The contrast between changes induced by influenza virus infection and by topical desialylation can be explained by the different pathologies: influenza virus infection of an epithelial surface causes necrosis and desialylation, while the changes induced by bacterial sialidase consist only of desialylation. In a virus infection, there is acute epithelial denudation and exposure of the basement membrane, allowing adherence of S. pneumoniae. With sialidase treatment alone, because there is no cell cytotoxicity or epithelial loss, there is no increased adherence of pneumococi. As detailed earlier, the Phase II clinical study did not document any increase in pneumococcal infection.",

In contrast, hPIV2 showed a broader range of binding to Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc derivatives, while hPIV3 showed a similar range of binding, but at a much lower magnitude than hPIV2. All three strains preferentially bound glycans with an \u03b12-3, rather than an \u03b12-6 linkage (Song et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The mechanism of binding and release of PIV differs from influenza viruses, as they have a different replication pathway, and thus may not be amenable to standard anti-influenza therapy. Thus, although zanamivir inhibited PIV neuraminidase activity, it did not prevent release of virus from the cell (Moscona, 2005, Porotto et al., 2001). As the parainfluenza viruses use \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 bound Sia for attachment, infection with these viruses could be amenable to sialidase treatment. Even though most studies utilizing DAS181 have used influenza A as a target, it has also been used in patients with parainfluenza. In an experimental setting, DAS181 treatment of human parainfluenza virus-permissive cell lines and of infected cotton rats led to effective desialylation and reduced infection (Moscona et al., 2010). DAS181 has also been used on a compassionate, emergency basis in immunocompromised patients infected with parainfluenza virus, with a beneficial effect. The first case was a 63 year old female stem cell transplant recipient who developed nasal congestion and cough, followed by clinical and radiological features of viral bronchiolitis and worsening respiratory function. She received three daily inhaled administrations of DAS181 using a dry powder inhaler, and showed improvement in clinical, radiological and pulmonary function parameters after treatment. PIV3 infection was confirmed, and there was a reduction in viral load after treatment (Chen et al., 2011). In another report, two immunocompromised lung or stem cell transplant recipients who developed PIV3 infection were successfully treated after developing lower respiratory tract disease. In these cases, there was a 5 day treatment with improvement in clinical symptoms and respiratory function, though changes in quantitative viral load did not match the clinical findings (Guzman-Suarez et al., 2012). However, a more recent case of DAS181 treatment of PIV3 pneumonia in a lung transplant patient was associated with both clinical improvement and reduction in viral load (Drozd et al., 2012).",
