MERS-CoV S binding to mDPP4 is inhibited by glycosylation on two mDPP4 residues which are hypothesized to physically inhibit binding of MERS-CoV S to mDPP4 [9]. Therefore, mouse model development has focused on humanizing mDPP4. Mice can be made susceptible to MERS-CoV infection by adenovirus transduction of human (h)DPP4 into the lungs of mice [10]. Though hDPP4 expressing mice display only mild clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, there is robust MERS-CoV replication in the lungs of the mice [10], making them useful for testing treatments or vaccines that block MERS-CoV replication in the lungs [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].",

While some mice in the non-adjuvanted 1 \u03bcg, 3 \u03bcg and 10 \u03bcg MERS S nanoparticles groups had measurable anti-MERS-CoV S antibody, this response was not statistically significant (P\n > 0.05 in all cases) when compared to PBS vaccinated controls. Sera from mice vaccinated with the Matrix-M1 adjuvant in combination with 1 \u03bcg, 3 \u03bcg or 10 \u03bcg of MERS S nanoparticles demonstrate significantly higher anti-S titers (for example, P\n < 0.0001 for 10 \u03bcg MERS-CoV S nanoparticles) compared to PBS vaccinated controls with an apparent dose dependent increase. These data demonstrate that the MERS-CoV S nanoparticles along with Matrix-M1 adjuvant produce high titer anti-MERS-CoV S antibody in vaccinated mice.",
