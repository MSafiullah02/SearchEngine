Studies have found that lncRNAs participate in the regulation of various biological processes by interactions with both nucleic acids and proteins and are also intimately involved in the development of malignancy and in host response to infectious diseases. 7, 8 In addition, research has also revealed that viral infections can cause abnormal lncRNA expression in host cells and that some lncRNAs are also encoded by viruses. 9, 10 These host and virally encoded lncRNAs regulate infections through various regulatory mechanisms, such as participating in innate immune responses and altering cellular metabolic pathways. 11, 12 Therefore, increased investigation and the functional characterization of the lncRNA repertoire elicited during the innate immune response and alterations in cellular metabolism following viral infection will help to elucidate the host defense mechanisms against viruses and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention and a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis.",

Similar to protein-coding mRNAs, most lncRNAs are 5\u2032 capped, spliced, 13 and can be either polyadenylated or nonpolyadenylated (ie, are bimorphic). 14, 15 lncRNAs are distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, typically have low expression levels, and exhibit poor conservation between species, although their structure is well conserved. 16, 17 The abundance of lncRNA transcripts is typically at least an order of magnitude lower than that of mRNAs, with an estimated 80% of lncRNAs tissue-specific. [18] [19] [20] According to the positional relationship between lncRNAs and their target genes on the chromosome, lncRNAs can be classified into five groups 21, 22 : (1) sense lncRNAs: located on the positive DNA strand and partially overlap with protein-coding genes (see Figure 1A ); (2) intronic lncRNAs: located entirely within an intron sequence of a target gene ( Figure 1B) ; (3) long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs): coexist on the same strand and are located upstream of the target gene with a spacing of less than 10 kb ( Figure 1C ); (4) antisense lncRNAs: located on the opposite strand of their target gene, and partially, or completely, overlap with the coding region ( Figure 1D ); and (5) bidirectional lncRNAs: located on the negative strand of the target gene with a spacing of less than 1 kb whereby transcriptional orientation is opposing and the transcripts do not overlap ( Figure 1E ).",

            "text": "It has been estimated that about 70% of the human genome can be transcribed, among which, only approximately 1% to 2% of the transcripts encode proteins, and the remaining 98% are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). 5, 23 Among the ncRNAs, tRNAs and rRNAs are well known for their structural and scaffolding roles, while the vast majority of the remaining ncRNA fraction have been regarded as \"transcriptional noise,\" and, until recently, their biology and roles in transcriptional processes are largely ignored. Gradually, studies have confirmed the functional importance of ncRNAs and that they play pivotal roles in cellular and metabolic activities, 8 with small ncRNAs and lncRNAs now known to account for an estimated 20% to 42% of ncRNAs. 24 Small ncRNAs, such as miRNAs, are involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular activities leading to gene silencing by base pairing with specific complementary nucleotide sequences of the mRNAs of their target genes. 25 In contrast, lncRNAs greater than 200 nts in length exert their functions by a greater variety of known mechanisms through interactions with either target proteins or nucleic acids via their specific and complex secondary structures. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] These known mechanisms can be classified into seven distinct groups: (1) lncRNA binds to transcription factors to form a transcription complex, which affects downstream gene expression by inhibiting RNA polymerase II or by mediating chromatin remodeling and histone modifications 31-34 ; (2) lncRNA forms a complementary doublestranded region with the mRNA transcript of its target gene, thereby interfering with the cleavage, transport, and/or translation of the targeted mRNA 35 ; (3) lncRNA competes with a target gene for transcription factors, thereby silencing the target gene expression; (4) lncRNA acts as a scaffold to bring multiple proteins together to regulate gene transcription 36 ; (5) lncRNA binds to a specific protein, altering the activity or cytoplasmic localization of the protein 37 ; (6) a lncRNA gene transcribes an additional ncRNA, such as pseudogenes and circular RNAs, and because of the similarity to the mRNA sequence of the target gene, the ncRNA can operate as a molecular sponge that attracts miRNAs, thereby insulating the transcription and translation of the functional genes from miRNA effects and enabling cross talk between different ncRNA classes 38 ; and finally (7) lncRNAs can be transcribed as the precursors of small molecule RNAs, such as miRNAs and piwiinteracting RNAs (piRNAs). 39 In summary, lncRNAs can regulate gene expression through DNA and RNA modifications by a variety of modes, such as by serving as signal molecules, decoy molecules, guide molecules, molecular sponges, and scaffolds. 27, 40 lncRNAs participate in multiple biological processes such as cell differentiation, carcinogenesis, and immune responses and play important roles in the development and, thereby, potentially in the prevention of human diseases. 28, 29, 41, 42 In the past decade, lncRNA biology has become a new frontier in life sciences and attracted many researchers to the field. In this review, we will focus on the present state of understanding of lncRNAs in the context of innate antiviral immunity. shown upon host infection to lead to differential expression of host lncRNAs compared with uninfected controls. Therefore, the differential expression of lncRNAs in various cell types following viral infection appears to be a widespread phenomenon and not a property attributable to one viral family or host target cell.",

For example, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a 2.7 kb lncRNA, \u03b22.7 53 ; \u03b22.7 inhibits the induction of stress responses and apoptosis in infected cells, which facilitates HCMV replication. 9 Gammaherpesviruses transcribe their own structurally and functionally intricate lncRNAs, which modulate cellular and viral gene expression to maintain viral latency or to induce lytic reactivation. 54 In addition, a 3.91 kb lncRNA M3-04 generated by gammaherpesviruses regulates viral replication in mice by interacting with antisense miRNAs and the latency gene M2. 55 Other herpesviruses also encode multiple functional lncRNAs, such as the Epstein-Barr virus encoding ncRNA, BamH I-A rightward transcripts, 56 Kaposi's sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (KSHV) encoding UCA1, 57 and herpesvirus saimiri encoding U-rich RNAs. 58 Additionally, the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the flavivirus RNA genome is capable of transcribing an active lncRNA, termed the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), which protects viral RNAs from degradation by the host nuclease Xrn1 and suppresses antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in infected human cells in culture and, also, interestingly, in mosquitoes by direct interaction with the RNAi machinery. 10,59 Therefore, viral infection FIGURE 1 Current classification of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) based on the positional relationship between lncRNAs and adjacent proteinencoding genes.

A, In A549 cells, NEAT1 relocates the negative regulatory factor SFPQ from the IL-8 promoter to subnuclear structures known as paraspeckles, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect of SFPQ on the IL-8 promoter and promoting the transcription of IL-8. B, miRNA-326 regulates the expression of ISG20 by binding to the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the ISG20 mRNA. lncRNA ISG20 competitively interacts with miRNA-326, thereby releasing free ISG20 mRNA and facilitating the translation of the ISG20 mRNA. C, lncRNA-ACOD1 causes a conformational change of GOT2, an essential aminotransferase during cell metabolism in the cytoplasm, at a position close to the substrate binding site, which enhances the catalytic activity of GOT2, thereby increasing the production of L-ASP and \u03b1-KG, increasing metabolic efficiency, and promoting VSV replication and infection lncRNA can also minimize the inhibitory effect of miRNAs through additional mechanisms, such as competitive binding or via so-called sponge effects where miRNAs are titrated from other targets, thereby promoting the translation of the miRNA-targeted mRNAs. 112 In A549 cells treated with poly(I:C) and Sendai virus, lncRNA ISG20, acting as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), competes with miRNA-326, resulting in a decreased abundance of miRNA-326 at the 3\u2032-UTR of the ISG20 mRNA. In addition, the reduced binding efficiency of microRNA-326 to ISG20 mRNA also promotes ISG20 translation and inhibits IAV replication ( Figure 3B ). 85 Similarly, lncRNA-BGL3, acting as a ceRNA, regulates the translation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) genes by competitively binding with a series of miRNAs, including miR-17, miR-93, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-106a, and miR-106b. 113 3.5 | lncRNAs affect viral replication by regulating cell metabolism",

To solve this problem, they hijack host metabolic pathways to derive the resources for viral replication. Hence, viruses act to regulate the metabolism of the host to improve their own replication efficiency. HNF4\u03b1 is a nuclear receptor that serves as a master regulator of hepatocyte differentiation by functioning in the activation of glycolysis in hepatocytes, inhibition of apoptosis of host cells, and promotion of flavivirus hepatitis C replication. 114 It has also been revealed by lipidomics that fatty acid and lipid mediators are critical in the replication of IAV in A549 cells. 115, 116 The involvement of lncRNAs in cellular metabolism plays a crucial role in innate immunity induced by viral infection. Wang et al found that deletion of lncRNA ACOD1 greatly attenuates VSV infection mediated by the IFN-I/IRF3-independent pathway. In addition, the lncRNA ACOD1 elevates the catalytic activity of glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2) by directly binding to GOT2 in the cytoplasm, and through which the metabolism of L-aspartic acid (L-ASP) and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) is promoted, leading to the immune escape for VSV ( Figure 3C ). 86 Taken together, these studies reveal a new regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs through which host metabolism, rather than classical innate immune pathways, is regulated to promote viral genomic replication and virus proliferation.

The perturbation of the transcription of ncRNAs elicited by virus infection often leads to disturbance of homeostasis, resulting in disease.67 lncRNAs regulate viral infections by modifying innate immune responses and cellular metabolic pathways at various levels including the activation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), epigenetic modulation, and transcriptional and posttranscriptional modification. 29 3 | REGULATION OF VIRAL REPLICATION BY LNCRNA-MEDIATED INNATE IMMUNITY 3.1 | Activation of pathogen recognition receptor-related signals by lncRNAs Innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral infections and plays a key role in identification of viral RNAs, induction of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs), and proinflammatory responses in the early stages of the infection process. 68,69 Whether viral infection activates innate immunity is dependent on the activation of PRRs and PRRdependent signaling pathways. Virus infection can also activate retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and Nod-like receptor (NLR) pathways, 70 which in turn activate interferon regulatory factors, such as IRF3, IRF7, and the major proinflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB. 71,72 The lncRNAs Lethe and lnc-Lsm3b have been shown to bind directly to immunosensors and block downstream signaling of the innate immune pathway (Table 1). The lncRNA Lethe competitively binds with and blocks NF-\u03baB from binding to specific promoter regions of its target genes, thereby preventing a cascade of signal transduction events. 63 The IFN-inducible, host-derived lncRNA, lnc-Lsm3b, directly competes with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RNA for the binding to the RIG-I monomer, limiting the conformational transition of the RIG-I PRR. Feedback in the later stages of the innate immune response inactivates RIG-I (Figure 2A), 73 thereby inhibiting the development of virus infection or activating type I interferon-mediated immune cells, such as dendritic, NK, and T cells, either directly or indirectly eliminating viral infections. 87 In addition, lnc-Lsm3b interferes with the interaction between caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) proteins, present in numerous innate immune effectors and the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein by stabilizing the interaction between the N-terminal CARD of RIG-I and the helicase domain. It has been demonstrated that TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I K63 is also inhibited by lnc-Lsm3b upon RNA virus stimulation. Taken together, these findings implicate lnc-Lsm3b as a potent negative regulator of innate RIG-I signaling pathway upon RNA virus infections. 73 TABLE 1 Host lncRNAs implicated in the innate antiviral immune response Lethe competitively binds with NF-\u03baB and inhibits the interaction between NF-\u03baB and the promoter, thereby preventing downstream signal transduction. Rapicavoli et al 63 Lsm3b VSV Binding of lnc-Lsm3b restricts the conformational change of the RIG-I protein, which inactivates the function of RIG-I, thereby limiting the production of type I interferon IFN-Cox2 interacts with hnRNPA/B or the SWI/SNF complex to regulate the expression of the innate immune-associated cytokines, chemokines, and ISGs that mediate inflammatory responses. NeST binds to WDR5, which is implicated in nucleosomal core histone methylation, thereby negatively regulating the transcription of type II interferons in CD8 + T cells. Gomez et al 76 NRAV IAV NRAV inhibits the transcriptional initiation of antiviral genes by affecting the histone modifications of MxA and IFITM3 (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3). Ouyang et al 77 Aspro5 HIV Aspro5 recruits a variety of histone modification enzymes to form a heterochromatic structure inhibiting the transcriptional activity of the viral promoter. of the lincRNA NRON, a scaffold protein, and three NFAT kinases forms a large cytoplasmic RNA-protein scaffold to inhibit the function of the transcription factor NFAT.

Atianand et al 79 sfRNA Flaviviruses sfRNA prevents the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and the initiation of transcription by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF3. sfRNA binds to the host RNA binding protein and CAPRIN1 and inhibits the transcription of IFITM2 and PKR; sfRNA also binds to the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and negatively regulates RIG-I expression. NEAT1 inhibits nuclear export of HIV-I mRNAs and reduces replication efficiency in viral cells.

ACOD1 binds to GOT2, an important aminotransferase during metabolism in the cytoplasm, and elevates the activity of GOT2, which in turn regulates the metabolism of L-aspartate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate, | lncRNAs regulate innate immunity through epigenetic regulation of gene transcriptionEpigenetic regulation is a reversible modification of genetic functions by modifying expression without alteration of the underlying nucleotide sequence during the pretranscriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes. 88 lncRNAs can regulate gene expression at the epigenetic level through chromatin remodeling pathways. 29,89 For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (or the synthetic triacylated lipopeptide Pam3CKS4) can induce formation of a lincRNA-Cox2 and SWI/SNF complex which modulates the assembly of NF-\u03baB subunits to the SWI/SNF complex in macrophages, triggering chromatin remodeling and transactivation of the late-primary inflammatory response genes in response to microbial challenge (Figure 2BandTable 1).74,75 lincRNA-Cox2 regulates the expression of numerous ISGs, such as OAS1, OAS2, OASL, IFI204, and ISG15 through the binding of hnRNP-A/B or A2/B1.75,90 Surprisingly, the expression of the adjacent gene Cox2, which is also an essential immunoregulatory factor, is not affected by lincRNA-Cox2 raising the possibility that another layer of transcriptional regulation is potentially affected by ncRNAs and other protein effectors remains undiscovered.It is well established that many lncRNA-mediated epigenetic regulations occur through modification of the nucleosomal core histone H3. Trimethylation of the N-terminal lysines of H3 at residues 4 and 27 (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively) can determine the structural state of the chromatin (ie, \"loose\" euchromatin or \"tight\" heterochromatin), and correspondingly, the expression of the cis-linked genes can be switched to \"on\" or \"off.\"76,91 In A549 cells, by regulating the abundance of the lncRNA negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV), located on chromosome 12q24.31, H3K27me3 is significantly enriched, thereby promoting the expression of ISGs, such as the immune effector proteins MxA and IFITM3. In turn, innate antiviral immunity is activated, and viral genome replication is inhibited.77 In addition, the lincRNA-Cox2 promotes the assembly of the reconstituted Mi-2 nucleosome and the deacetylase (Mi-2/NuRD) repressor complex in the promoter region of the secondary response gene IL-12b, resulting in a decrease of histone H3K27 acetylation and an elevation of H3K27 dimethylation, respectively. This epigenetic mechanism contributes to the lincRNA-Cox2-mediated transinhibition of the IL-12b gene.92 The lncRNA NeST can promote the formation of H3K4me3 by forming a complex with the WD (Trp-Asp) repeat-containing protein",

            "text": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate innate immune responses through activation of RIG-I and via deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms. A, Under normal circumstances in the resting state of macrophages, RIG-I exists in the autoinhibited state with the CARD2 domain of RIG-I binding to the insertion region of the helicase. With the invasion of the 5\u2032-triphosphate double-stranded viral RNA, the CTD senses and binds the viral RNA, which leads to the structural transformation of RIG-I into an open conformation and the release of CARDs, thereby mediating downstream signaling and induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression. After sensing the extracellular IFN-\u03b2 signal, TLR2 upregulates the expression of lnc-Lsm3b, which inhibits RIG-I-mediated immune responses by binding to RIG-I and suppresses the production of IFN-\u03b2 and other anti-inflammatory factors. B, TLR2 and TLR4 induce the expression of lincRNA-Cox2 through the NF-\u03baB signal pathway upon LPS or Pam3CKS4 stimulation. On the one hand, lincRNA-Cox2 promotes the binding of the Mi-2/NuRD complex in the promoter region of IL-12b, decreasing histone H3K27 acetylation and increasing H3K27 dimethylation, which leads to lincRNA-Cox2-mediated transinhibition of the secondary response gene IL-12b. Alternatively, upon LPS stimulation, lincRNA-Cox2 is assembled into the SWI/SNF complex and acts to recruit NF-\u03baB to the complex, which plays an important role in the regulation of SWI/SNF-associated chromatin remodeling and the transactivation of advanced inflammatory response genes WDR5, thereby repressing the IFN-\u03b3 promoter. This ultimately results in an increase in type II interferon transcript levels in the activated CD8 + T cells.76 Interestingly, this enhancer-like lncRNA NeST is located adjacent to the IFN-\u03b3-encoding locus in both the mouse (Ifng) and human (IFNG) genomes. NeST was initially discovered as a candidate susceptibility locus for infection by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a single-stranded, positive sense RNA cardiovirus, family Picornaviridae. The acronym NeST abbreviates in French as nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler's (\"cleanup Salmonella not Theiler's\"). In both the murine and human genomes, not only is synteny conserved but the NeST lncRNA is also encoded on the opposite DNA strand to that coding for IFN-\u03b3 in both species. Thereby, the survival of TMEV is prolonged in mice, but the pathogenicity of Salmonella enterica is attenuated.76 Whether such host-derived lncRNAs, such as NeST, represent lncRNA targets with pharmaceutical potential where bacterial infection could be attenuated without predisposing to viral infections in humans is clearly worthy of further study.Apart from lncRNAs encoded by the human host, lncRNAs derived from the virus itself are also emerging as important elements for epigenetic regulation during infection. 93 The HIV-encoded lncRNA aspro5 recruits the host de novo DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase (DNMT3a), the histone deacetylase HDAC1, the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, and the polycomb protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to the 5\u2032 long terminal repeat of the integrated proviral DNA. This leads to the formation of H3K9me2, H3K27me3, histone deacetylation, and associated transcriptional inert heterochromatic structures. These changes in the chromatin structure inhibit transcriptional activity of the promoter, thereby silencing the expression of the viral gene and likely contributing to latency and immune evasion of the integrated retroviral genome. 78 3.3 | lncRNAs regulate innate immunity at the transcriptional level Transcriptional regulation is one of the most important mechanisms in controlling eukaryotic gene expression. lncRNAs can saturate the binding sites of transcription factors and thus inhibit the transcription and expression of IFNs and ISGs. 94,95 On the other hand, lncRNAs can also recruit transcription factors to promoters and enhancers to initiate transcription of innate immune genes. 82,96,97 For example, lncRNA-DC has been shown to regulate the activity of a number of transcription factors. When cells are stimulated by pathogens, lncRNA-DC, which has been found to be specifically expressed in dendritic cells, binds to the transcription factor STAT3 and blocks the binding site for SHP1. The sustained activation of STAT3 induced by the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 705 promotes the expression of genes involved in dendritic cell differentiation. 98 lncRNA-DC is also implicated in the immune response to HBV and acts by reducing the concentration of secreted TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3, as well as increasing the IL-1\u03b2 concentration in dendritic cells. 99 lncRNAs can form a complex with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) to regulate the expression of ISGs. lncRNA",

            "text": "NEAT1, and lincRNA-EPS, can indirectly regulate the transcription of immune-related genes. TNF-\u03b1 is a critical cytokine that activates NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses. THRIL forms a complex with hnRNPL, which in turn activates the TNF-\u03b1 transcription by binding to the TNF-\u03b1 promoter.90 TNF-\u03b1 regulates THRIL expression through a negative feedback. The expression of additional cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-8, CCL1, CSF1, and CXCL10, is also regulated by the lncRNA THRIL.NEAT1 is an important regulator of antiviral responses, whose expression is elevated by viral infections including HIV-1, Japanese encephalitis virus, rabies virus, influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus, and Hantavirus.37,102,103 In the cytoplasm, NEAT1 interacts with the NONO protein to promote the formation of paraspeckles in the nucleus. Paraspeckles are subnuclear structures, termed ribonucleoprotein bodies, found in the interchromatin spaces in nuclei and are thought to regulate gene expression by inhibiting nuclear RNA export.The targeting of paraspeckles by retroviruses may serve to impede host responses to viral infection and help establish latency. NEAT1 also functions in the relocalization of the splicing factor SFPQ from the promoter region of the antiviral cytokine IL-8 to the paraspeckle. In this way, the inhibition of transcription by SFPQ is released, leading to the induction of IL-8 expression and inhibition of HIV-1 replication (Figure 3A). 37 Without interference from pathogens, lincRNA-EPS, which possesses immunoregulatory properties in macrophages, accumulates in the regulatory region of immune response genes (IRGs). By interacting with hnRNPL via a CANACA motif located at its 3\u2032-end, lincRNA-EPS regulates nucleosome localization and IRG transcription, thereby reducing proinflammatory responses. 79 Interestingly, certain virus-encoded lncRNAs with transcriptional regulatory functions play important roles in host-virus interactions. 78,104 The flavivirus-encoded lncRNA, sfRNA, is highly conserved in the 3\u2032-UTR of the flavivirus genome. 80 Studies have shown that sfRNA inhibits the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation, thereby preventing the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and inhibiting the transcription of IFN-\u03b2. 81,105 Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2)-induced sfRNA inhibits the transcription of IFITM2 and the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) by binding to the host RNA-binding proteins G3BP1, G3BP2, and CAPRIN1, which in turn negatively regulates the expression of IFITM2 and PKR. 83 It has also been confirmed that DENV2induced sfRNA prevents deubiquitination of the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 by direct binding to TRIM25, thereby negatively regulating RIG-I expression and inhibiting innate immune responses. 82 KSHV-infected cells express a lncRNA, termed polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN RNA), which modulates the cellular immune response by interacting with both viral and cellular DNA and proteins. 106 The PAN RNA plays an important role in controlling viral gene transcription and subversion of the host immune response. 107,108 The PAN lncRNA exerts these effects by interacting with specific histone demethylases (UTX and JMJD3) and physically binds to the KSHV genome to mediate activation of viral gene expression by removing suppressive trimethylated H3K23 marks. 109 In addition to interacting with histone demethylases, PAN RNA also interacts with SUZ12 and EZH2 which are components of the Polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2), a chromatin-modifying (histone methylation) complex, which represses gene expression at numerous loci. 104 Despite these advances, limited information has been revealed to date about virus-encoded lncRNAs with regulatory functions at the transcriptional level. In the future, the discovery and functional characterization of this lncRNA class of virally encoded transcripts will help in the delineation of virus-host interactions and may afford the opportunity to develop therapeutics that inhibit virus-specific lncRNAs. 3.4 | Posttranscriptional regulation of innate immunity by lncRNAs lncRNAs also regulate posttranscriptional modification of mRNAs by involvement in splicing and processing, enhancing mRNA stability, and improving nuclear export efficiency. Upon exposure to amyloid \u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2 peptide), the expression level of the antisense lncRNA BACE1-AS, transcribed by the beta-secretase 1 gene (BACE1), is elevated. This increases the stability of the BACE1 mRNA and generates additional A\u03b2 peptide through a posttranscriptional, feedforward mechanism. 110 Some lncRNAs can reduce the nuclear export efficiency of viral mRNAs and inhibit viral replication. HIV-1 infection can induce a differential expression of the lncRNA NEAT1 in T cells, which serves as a binding scaffold maintaining the integrity of paraspeckles and prevents the transport of spliced HIV-1 pre-mRNA to the cytoplasm for translation",

            "text": "SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS lncRNAs interact with proteins and nucleic acids through specific binding to tertiary conformational structures or complementary nucleotide base pairing within genes, respectively, thereby playing essential roles in the regulatory network of innate immune responses and viral replication. Firstly, virus-induced lncRNAs promote immune responses following a self-recognition mode. Acting as a potent molecular decoy, the inducible \"self\" lncRNA blocks the RIG-I binding site to limit viral RNA-induced innate immune responses and maintain immune homeostasis. Secondly, ncRNAs can regulate innate immunity at the transcriptional level by activating transcription initiation complexes or competing for transcription factor binding sites. In addition, host lncRNAs can release more free mRNAs and enhance the expression of innate immune-related genes by increasing mRNA stability and relieving the restrictions imposed by miRNAs. Thirdly, lncRNAs can also promote the assembly of posttranslational histone modification complexes by recruiting histone methyltransferases to regulate the expression of innate immune factors, such as IFNs and ISGs at the epigenetic level. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence for the role of the ubiquitous and versatile classes of lncRNAs in antiviral regulation. Although many breakthroughs have been achieved towards the understanding of lncRNA-mediated innate immune responses, the study of lncRNAs is only in its infancy when compared with other ncRNAs, such as microRNAs. IFN-I-independent lncRNAs can also promote viral replication by regulating cellular metabolism, and this serves as a new paradigm for the regulation of viral infection other than via effects on innate immunity. 86 This mechanism adds a further layer of complexity to the regulatory networks previously established in viral infection. The connection between lncRNAs, metabolism, and virus infection has set a new direction for the study of immune regulatory mechanisms; however, this is far from fully understood, and the discovery and functional annotation of numerous lncRNAs remain to be further explored. With a deeper understanding of host and virally encoded lncRNAs and the regulatory mechanisms involved in the innate antiviral immune response they impact upon, this will likely provide new druggable targets and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of infectious disease.",
