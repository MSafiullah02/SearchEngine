In subgroups of patients (eg, elderly people), clinical presentation can have less evident symptoms (eg, an altered state of consciousness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and fever can be absent) and diagnosis is frequently delayed. A prolonged time between the onset of symptoms and a medical visit has been described for less severe pneumonia, individuals with alcoholism, and for patients receiving drugs such as corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antibiotics.7 For some pathogens, unusual clinical presentations that involve the gradual onset of symptoms such as dry cough, the absence of fever, and extrapulmonary manifestations are frequent. For example, patients with pneumonia due to Legionella spp can present with headache, confusion, diarrhoea, and clinical manifestations of hyponatraemia.8\nMycoplasma pneumoniae can be associated with upper respiratory involvement (otitis, pharyngitis), skin changes (Stevens-Johnson-like syndrome), and haemolytic anaemia.9 Investigators have clearly shown that differentiation between typical and atypical pneumonia on the basis of patient history and chest radiograph is not reliable in guidance of antibiotic treatment.3, 10 By contrast, the use of validated scores for antibiotic decisions is promising. A 2014 study11 proposed a score that can rule out Legionella spp pneumonia with a negative predictive value of 99%.",

In these cases, clinicians should rely on clinical evaluations (including manifestations of LRTI, focal chest sounds, exclusion of other possible diagnosis) and point-of-care tests (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP]).6\n",

Because differentiation of pneumonia from non-infectious disorders such as acute heart failure is occasionally difficult, prompt start of antibiotic treatment is recommended. Biomarkers (eg, procalcitonin [PCT]) can help in the early differentiation from heart failure decompensation, avoiding antibiotic misuse.13 When the diagnosis of pneumonia is excluded, antibiotic treatment must be stopped. Dynamic evaluation of the patient also helps the clinician in terms of management (eg, pulmonary infiltrates that resolve completely after positive pressure ventilation are probably due to heart failure or atelectasis). In patients with recurrent pneumonia, underlying diseases should be suspected such as lung cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, foreign bodies, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and unknown immunosuppressed status.",

The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)18 and CURB-6563 are the most frequently used scores. PSI is composed of 20 items and classifies patients into five categories of severity that are associated with the risk of mortality. Age and comorbidities are highly weighted in the PSI, and for these reasons, PSI can underestimate the severity of pneumonia in young patients and in those without previous diseases. CURB-65 uses five items and is practical for calculations, although it does not account for comorbidities. Important considerations not included in either score are socioeconomic status and social support, both of which can affect outcomes.64 Both PSI and CURB-65 were not developed to predict complications associated with community-acquired pneumonia; clinical research is needed to develop specific scores to predict these events.",

A cluster-crossover trial assessed the non-inferiority of \u03b2-lactam versus \u03b2-lactam plus macrolide versus fluoroquinolone regimens with 90 day mortality as the primary outcome. Including 2283 patients with clinically suspected pneumonia treated in non-intensive-care-unit wards, monotherapy with \u03b2-lactam was not inferior to the other antibiotic regimens.79 Another non-inferiority, open-label trial randomly assigned 580 patients with moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia to receive \u03b2-lactam or \u03b2-lactam plus macrolide.80 The study was unable to show non-inferiority for clinical stability after 7 days of treatment. Nevertheless, a non-significant trend for superiority was shown in favour of dual therapy (between-group difference 7\u00b76%, two-sided 95% CI \u22120\u00b78% to 16\u00b70%). For severe community-acquired pneumonia, coverage of typical and atypical pathogens seems to be protective of mortality and is recommended by major guidelines.3, 4, 5 Macrolides seem to have additional benefits due to their immunomodulatory effects in severe community-acquired pneumonia.81, 82\n",

Because resistant pathogens have different treatments, scores based on specific risk factors for each pathogen might be more useful methods compared with general definitions.34, 35, 89 Another concern is related to the treatment of patients who are at risk for resistant pneumococcus, such as elderly patients (age >65 years), those who have received recent therapy with \u03b2-lactams, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones; alcohol consumption; and immunosuppression (appendix).3, 90\n",

However, this meta-analysis included only 151 patients in three randomised trials, and benefits were particularly evident in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or immunosuppression.106 Non-invasive ventilation can also be considered a palliative treatment in patients with terminal illness.107 For mechanically ventilated patients, protective ventilation is strongly recommended on diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome. For less severe pneumonia, protective ventilation also seems to prevent the progression of lung injury.3, 108\n",

A multicentre randomised controlled trial112 showed a shorter time to reach clinical stability in patients with pneumonia receiving oral prednisone (50 mg a day for 7 days) in relation to the placebo group (3\u00b70 days vs 4\u00b74 days, hazard ratio 1\u00b733 95% CI 1\u00b715\u20131\u00b750). Another multicentre randomised controlled trial113 showed that methylprednisolone (0\u00b75 mg/kg per 12 h for 5 days) reduced risk for treatment failure compared with placebo (OR 0\u00b734, 95% CI 0\u00b714\u20130\u00b787) in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia with high baseline concentrations of CRP. For mortality, updated meta-analyses110, 111, 114, 115, 116 report no conclusive results for hospitalised patients, although corticosteroids were associated with better survival in the subgroup with severe community-acquired pneumonia.114, 115, 116, 117 However, trials included in the meta-analyses were small, have high heterogeneity, and insufficient power to assess mortality. No definitive data are available for the best type and dose of corticosteroids for patients with community-acquired pneumonia, nor those for whether they should be given continuously or to intermittent and tapering schemes.6 The clinician should be aware of possible steroid-induced side-effects in patients. In controlled settings (eg, randomised controlled trials), only hyperglycaemia was more frequently reported for patients with community-acquired pneumonia receiving a corticosteroid. However, large trials including patients with severe sepsis or septic shock with community-acquired pneumonia as the main source of infection, showed other steroid side-effects such as superinfection.6, 118\n",

The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine contains polysaccharides for 23 pneumococcal serotypes and the most recent version of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains 13 serotypes. By comparison with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine seems to induce a stronger and longer-lasting secondary immune response with booster effect.142 Results from a recent meta-analysis showed strong evidence for the recommendation for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine-23 vaccination to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease in adults.143 Nevertheless, there is less clear evidence for its efficacy in the prevention of non-bacteraemic pneumonia,143 in patients with chronic illnesses, and for the reduction of all-cause pneumonia and mortality.143 The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-13 was approved for clinical use in adults by the US and European agencies. The CAPiTA study144 (a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving nearly 85 000 adults older than 65 years) showed clinical efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-13 in the prevention of the first episode of vaccine-serotype pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (including non-bacteraemic pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease);144 however, the trial excluded immunosuppressed patients and previously vaccinated person. Because a substantial number of cases of pneumonia is caused by serotypes not included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-13 (38% of invasive pneumococcal disease in the US in 2013), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the administration of both pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-13 and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine-23 in series to all adults aged 65 years and older (panel 1\n).142 Outstanding research questions remain, which should be addressed in future large trials (panel 2\n).Panel 1Controversies and uncertainties\n1The implementation of rapid diagnostic testing using PCR techniques for viruses and bacteria might increase the number of microbiological diagnoses and consequently the number of initial appropriate treatments; although some devices are able to provide rapid diagnoses, well designed studies are needed to investigate major outcomes and cost-effectiveness4, 53\n2The real rates of different to treat pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase, and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, differ between continents and countries (eg, the USA and Japan vs Europe); the concept of health-care-associated pneumonia is not accurate and has resulted in the excessive administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics;84 risk factors for these microorganisms have been described recently, but implementation in clinical practice is still lacking34, 35\n3Combination antibacterial therapy is a matter of debate; such therapy is recommended for patients with community-acquired pneumonia who are admitted to the intensive care unit,3, 4 and in patients with bacteraemic Streptococcus pneumoniae;82 furthermore, patients with high mortality admitted to the ward might benefit from this treatment strategy80\n4Recent data from randomised controlled trials112, 113 showed a reduction of time to clinical stability and of treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia receiving corticosteroids; however, data are controversial for effect on mortality; a prematurely halted trial of severe community-acquired pneumonia revealed an important decrease in mortality (39% vs 0%)117\n5The long-term cardiovascular complications of patients with community-acquired pneumonia are not completely understood; but it seems that residual inflammation might have an important role in triggering procoagulation pathways and leading to cardiovascular complications37, 138\n\nPanel 2Outstanding research questions\n1Interventional studies are needed of microbiological testing techniques to increase the rate of initial appropriate treatments, which would result in improved outcomes and reduced overuse of antibiotics2Validation studies that use risk factors for different-to-treat microorganisms to confirm the accuracies of these risk factors for their implementation in clinical practice are also needed3Interventional studies should be done to assess cost-effectiveness for C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in low-income and middle-income countries and specific settings4A randomised controlled trial is needed in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia who are not admitted to the intensive care unit that compares monotherapy with respiratory quinolones and combination therapy (\u03b2-lactam plus macrolide)5Investigators should do a large randomised controlled trial in patients with community-acquired pneumonia who are admitted to intensive care units that assesses the administration of corticosteroids versus placebo powered to address mortality and quality-of-life outcomes6Studies of severe community-acquired pneumonia are needed, both in animal models and in human beings, to test new coadjutant treatments, such as enriched immunoglobulin M, monoclonal antibodies, and molecules that can block the endotoxins and exotoxins of the microbes7Prospective observational follow-up studies in patients with community-acquired pneumonia are needed to better describe the clinical and biological risk factors for cardiovascular complications to design a pharmacological randomised controlled trial\n",
