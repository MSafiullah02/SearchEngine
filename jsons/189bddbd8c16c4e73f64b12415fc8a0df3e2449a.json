Consequently, it has been examined as a potential protein target to prevent infection expansion by inhibiting the cleavage of the viral polyprotein [18] . This might explain why statins could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess whether statins might be potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors. Namely, most recently the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), a key coronavirus enzyme, which is a potential drug target, has been successfully crystallised [19, 20] . Therefore, the idea was to investigate whether statins could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 by directly affecting the virus particle.",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak in China on 30 January 2020 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [2] . Due to the rapid increase in the numbers of patients outside China and the growing number of countries that were involved, on 12 March 2020 the WHO stated that COVID-19 was characterised as a pandemic. To date, more than 2.3 million people have contracted this disease, and more than 170,000 have died because of it. No proven specific drugs and no immunisation are available so far, while therapeutic options are very limited [3, 4] . In fact, only preventive and supportive therapies directed to prevent complications of the disease and organ damage are available. Although antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are used in some countries for the treatment of this disease, at present there is not sufficient evidence to determine whether they are effective treatments for COVID-19 [5] .",
