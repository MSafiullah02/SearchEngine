After mixing, the calcium phosphate dispersion was mixed with solutions of either functional siRNA, scrambled siRNA (GE healthcare life sciences, Chalfont St. Giles, UK), or fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotides (Life technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) (4 mg mL\u22121). To encapsulate the calcium phosphate nanoparticles into the biodegradable polymer poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) (Resomer\u00ae RG 502 H, Evonik Industries, Darmstadt, Germany), a water-in-oil-in-water (W1/O/W2) double emulsion solvent evaporation method was applied. The dispersed polyvinylalcohol (PVA)-coated nanoparticles were purified by centrifugation, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. The freeze-dried particles were resuspended in a solution of aqueous PEI (2 mg mL\u22121 branched 25kD, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) at a ratio (w/w) of 1:2 to obtain the final nanoparticle structure. The particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (ESEM Quanta 400) after sputtering with gold\u2013palladium. Dynamic light scattering was performed with a Zetasizer nanoseries instrument (Nano-ZS Malvern, laser wavelength \u03bb\n = 532 nm).",

During the treatment, the weight loss was monitored daily. While non-transgenic mice did not lose any weight after the cell transfer, SPC-HA transgenic mice which were treated with scrambled siRNA-loaded nanoparticles or PBS exhibited a weight loss of 7% by day 6. Interestingly, the transgenic mice treated with specific siRNAs lost less weight than the animals of the control groups (Figure 4, B). Mice were sacrificed on day 6 and further analyzed. Importantly, mice treated with siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticles had a significantly reduced number of cells within the BAL fluid compared to scrambled control or PBS treated mice, indicating a less severe inflammation, as patients suffering from pulmonary inflammation often exhibit an influx of immune cells due to increased chemokine production14 (Figure 4, C). Furthermore, the lung tissue of mice treated with siRNA against CCL-2, IP-10 and IFN-\u03b3 was less severely inflamed than tissue from control animals. Less alveolar epithelial cell type II hyperplasia, a reduced accumulation of alveolar macrophages and a decreased number of neutrophils in the interstitium were found in siRNA-treated mice. This is also reflected in the significantly reduced histological score of the lung tissue (Figure 4, D). Finally, to validate if the potential beneficial effect of the siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticle treatment is due to the decreased expression of the target genes, biopsies of the lung and fluid from the BAL were analyzed for gene expression. Indeed, the expression of all three target genes was significantly decreased on mRNA and protein level (Figure 4, E). The expression of CCL-2 was reduced by 40% compared to the scrambled control treated animals on both, mRNA and protein level. The IP-10 expression in lung tissue was decreased by 50% on mRNA level while the down-regulation on protein level was less prominent but nevertheless reduced by 25%. The IFN-\u03b3 production was also significantly diminished by 55% on protein level. In summary, these results indicate a beneficial therapeutic effect of siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticles for inflammation of the lung.",

While for some viral infections vaccines are available, other diseases like the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus are not curable and a vaccine does not exist.15 A therapeutic rather than a prophylactic approach to treat viral infections is the use of siRNA to interfere in the reproduction of the virus and inhibit its spreading. To verify if this interference is a possibility to reduce the viral load, CaP/PLGA nanoparticles were loaded with siRNA directed against the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the influenza virus. BALB/c mice were infected with the influenza virus and treated with siRNA-loaded nanoparticles two days post infection and analyzed for signs of sickness on day 5 (Figure 5, A\n). To verify that the viral protein expression is altered due to the treatment with siRNA-loaded nanoparticles, the NS-1 expression was analyzed in the lung tissue. Indeed, the expression of NS-1 in the lung of infected mice which received siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticle was significantly decreased (Figure 5, B). In consequence, also the viral load was significantly reduced in the lung on day 5 (Figure 5, C). The histopathological analysis of the lung tissue revealed less structural damages and less infiltrated cells in mice treated with siRNA against NS1 compared to mice treated with scrambled siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticles or PBS. The histological score was significantly decreased by almost half in mice which received NS1 siRNA treatment (Figure 5, D). In summary, these results illustrate a promising therapeutic approach against viral infections.",

They are characterized by airflow limitation, emphysema, fibrosis or bronchitis. Despite ongoing research, currently available therapies, mainly inhalers, aim to minimize symptoms and aggravations but are not curative. Inhalers open the airway muscles by relaxation or interfere in the activation of the immune system but are unspecific. Therefore, medications to treat the underlying inflammation or infection might be an improved and promising treatment strategy. Here, we have used an inflammatory model based on CD4+ TH1 lymphocytes which are described to be important effectors of pulmonary injury, especially in ILD.16 Many diseases, including ILD and COPD, are caused by excessive, incorrect activity of genes; the ability of siRNA to modulate gene expression specifically on a molecular level offers a suitable approach for interference. Here, we used a sterile model of lung inflammation to analyze the potency of local modification of gene expression by siRNA. SiRNA directed against CCL-2, IP-10 and IFN-\u03b3 was used to reduce gene expression in inflamed lung tissue, and siRNA directed against NS-1 of the influenza virus itself to diminish viral replication. To exert its function, siRNA must be delivered to the target tissue; here, we demonstrated that CaP/PLGA nanoparticles can successfully be used as delivery vehicle to the lung tissue. The nanoparticles protect the siRNA from the environment and can be used to decrease gene expression and thereby abrogate inflammatory responses in the lung.",

PEI, a different polymer, was applied to the surface for an increased cellular uptake and endosomal escape.18 Alongside an increased uptake efficiency, PEI was reported to induce inflammatory responses in the lung19; however, in this study, no inflammatory effects were detected. This might be due to the highest uptake rate by macrophages in this study, while a study by Beyerle and colleagues demonstrated that PEI mainly affects alveolar epithelial cells.20 Other reports highlighted that the drug delivery to alveolar macrophages has been shown to be most efficient with particles in the low micrometer range,21, 22 while smaller particles have been suggested to have a toxic effect. This effect might be due to the distribution of the nanoparticles beyond the lung into the blood and brain. However, not all particles in the nanoscale behave the same, but their properties depend on the composition. Other publications noticed only a minimal translocation of nanoparticles applied to the lung.23, 24 Furthermore, compared to larger particles, particles in the nanoscale can target a variety of cells and not only macrophages,25, 26 resulting in an increased uptake and delivery of active compound. In previous publications, we have shown that this composition of nanoparticles is highly efficient to achieve an increased ability of gene silencing per nanoparticle as well as an efficient uptake and down-regulation of target genes at mucosal surfaces.8, 9\n",

            "text": "Patients suffering from acute or chronic lung disorders have increased levels of several chemokines and cytokines in sputum samples, blood or the fluid obtained from BALs.27 In our model, we regulated the expression of IFN-\u03b3, CCL-2 and IP-10 to achieve a decreased inflammation of the lung. IFN-\u03b3 was found to be elevated in lung biopsies of patients suffering from COPD,28 and Wang and colleagues demonstrated the importance of IFN-\u03b3 in lung related diseases, as IFN-\u03b3 overexpressing mice develop pulmonary emphysema.29 In response to IFN-\u03b3, IP-10 is secreted by several cell types and functions as chemoattractant for natural killer cells and macrophages. IP-10 is elevated in blood and sputum samples of COPD patients, and increased levels were found to correlate with disease severity.13 Similar to IP-10, CCL-2 functions as chemoattractant and is elevated in sputum samples of patients with inflammatory lung conditions.27 Studies regarding the function of CCL-2 or its receptor, CCR2, hardly exist. However, a murine antagonist against CCR2 was successfully applied to reduce influenza virus induced lung pathology.30 The treatment with CaP/PLGA nanoparticles loaded with siRNA against these three target genes led to decreased levels of gene expression in the TH1-induced model of lung inflammation, thus we have indirectly shown the successful delivery of siRNA and its release to the cytoplasm into cells from the lung, after nasal instillation. The knockdown of all three mRNAs was sufficient to decrease protein levels of the target genes and most importantly, to restrict the pulmonary inflammation. So far, biological agents have not proven successful in clinical trials for inflammatory conditions of the lung31, 32; one reason might be the different phenotypes and varying symptoms between patients. Furthermore, the inflammatory response is likely not driven by only one mediator but may be attributed to several dysregulated genes. The siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticles have turned out as a promising approach, as they are easily adaptable to individual patients and can target several overexpressed genes at once.",

While flu caused by the influenza virus is rarely dangerous due to effective immunization, several viral infections exist with no potent vaccine available. A therapeutic rather than a prophylactic approach against viral infections might be the knockdown of viral gene expression themselves. As proof-of-principle experiment, we used siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticles directed against NS-1 of the influenza virus and demonstrated a reduced viral load and pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use siRNA against NS-1 as a therapeutic treatment and to apply the nanoparticles locally to the lung. A previous study only exhibited the beneficial effect of intravenous, prophylactic treatment with siRNA against influenza viral infection.33\n",
