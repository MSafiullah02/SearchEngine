It is important to describe the clinical characteristics of low severity patients to provide information for early clinical recognition of COVID-19 and to prompt rapid self-quarantine for people with presumed symptoms who are not sick enough to warrant hospitalization. Moreover, mild patients can facilitate rapid dissemination of COVID-19 by unwittingly spreading the virus in the outpatient setting; this group appears to be a major driver of the pandemic (13). Because COVID-19 testing has largely focused on patients with respiratory symptoms\u2014not digestive symptoms\u2014it is possible that there is a large cohort of undiagnosed patients with low severity illness but with digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, who unknowingly spread the virus. In this study, we sought to better understand the prevalence and clinical characteristics of this important COVID-19 subgroup with digestive symptoms and mild disease.",

We began by reviewing the clinical records of 850 consecutively hospitalized patients admitted between February 13, 2020, and February 29, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens (5). From this group, we included patients who met the criteria for mild disease severity, defined as patients without dyspnea, without clinical evidence of respiratory distress and were able to maintain blood oxygen saturation above 93% in resting condition (14). Of note, these patients were admitted to the hospital despite mild symptoms to monitor clinically and to maintain in quarantine during the peak of the Wuhan outbreak until they had 2 sequential negative respiratory tract specimens collected \u226524 hours apart according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control guidance (4). We excluded patients from this study who were unable to provide a history of presenting illness and/or did not have complete clinical data available for extraction. We also excluded patients who had not yet achieved viral clearance of COVID-19 and thus were not yet discharged at the time of this analysis. From this group, we systematically evaluated the symptoms recorded on the admission intake, supported by direct patient interviews using a standardized questionnaire and by telephone interview into the patient's room when necessary (because of extreme isolation precautions), to identify a cohort of patients with one or more digestive symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.",

Because the intestinal wall is invaded by COVID-19, there may be increased permeability and diminished barrier function, easier invasion of pathogens across a vast intestinal surface area, the presence of enteric symptoms such as diarrhea, and nutrient malabsorption (6). Recent evidence reveals that fecal nucleic acid is readily detected in the stool of patients with COVID-19 (4) and rectal swabs are also positive in some patients (15). Given the high prevalence of positive stools in patients with COVID-19, coupled with the correlation between diarrhea and stool positivity, we recommend routine real-time reverse transcriptase PCR testing of feces in patients with COVID-19, especially those presenting with digestive symptoms.",

These data emphasize that patients with new-onset diarrhea after a possible COVID-19 contact should be suspected for the illness, even in the absence of cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, or even fever.
