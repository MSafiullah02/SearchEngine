However, when the virus mutates within a susceptible host, the ability of the virus to replicate in macrophages can be enhanced. The mutated forms of FCoV develop in fewer than 5% of cats with FCoV, but this process causes a fatal disease \u2014 feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).1 Mutated forms of FCoV that cause FIP are renamed feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).",

Fever, inappetence, lethargy, and jaundice can be observed in cats with either form of FIP.2 Animals with the wet form of the disease have ascites and/or pleural effusion. Evaluation of these fluids can aid in the diagnosis of FIP, but there is significant overlap in findings associated with FIP and those associated with other causes of effusion. In cats with the dry form of FIP, granulomas form in a variety of organs, making the dry form FIP even more difficult to diagnose.",

Therefore, vaccination against FCoV is ineffective. It is also believed that T-cell immunity directly contributes to clinical signs associated with FIPV. Cats with the wet form of FIP mount relatively poor, ineffective T-cell immune responses against FIPV. Whereas animals with the dry form of FIP seem to mount an enhanced T-cell immune response against the virus. This enhanced response prevents formation of effusions, but leads to a more chronic granulomatous response to infection.3\n",
