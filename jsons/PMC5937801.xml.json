            "text": "Cryofibrinogenemia is a rare hematologic disorder wherein plasma forms a cryoprecipitate that consists of fibrinogen, fibrin, fibronectin, factor VII, and smaller amounts of various plasma proteins. Cryofibrinogen precipitates at a low temperature (4 \u00b0C) and re-dissolves on warming to (37 \u00b0C) [1]. Its exact pathogenesis has not been elucidated. A first hypothesis is that there is a defect in the fibrinolytic process, with high plasma levels of \u03b11 antitrypsin and \u03b12-macroglobulin (protease inhibitors), and delayed lysis of euglobulin. But since elevated plasma \u03b11-antitrypsin and \u03b12-macroglobulin levels are not found in other studies, a second hypothesis favors an increased thrombin-binding capacity and clot formation. Both hypotheses lead to thrombotic occlusions of medium and small vessels, leading to amplified hyper-viscosity, reflex vasospasms, and vascular stasis [2].",

They presented with only mild skin manifestations as purpura and bullae [9]. Compared to common clinical manifestations, purpura and arthralgia are more prevalent than in previous review articles (purpura 0\u201378%; arthralgia 6.25\u201358%). Nevertheless, muscle weakness has not been previously mentioned [2]. This kind of disease is difficult to diagnose in children because initial complaints are variable and non-specific. We approached this disease from the perspective of purpura. The platelet count of all patients was normal. According to the follow-up non-thrombocytopenia purpura survey, all patients exhibited normal PT/aPTT. Thus, we considered vWF disease, platelet dysfunction, and vascular disease to have caused purpura. Although PLT dysfunction and vWF diseases are typically congenital, those cases diagnosed in the patients were acquired. Therefore, the purpura caused by vascular diseases was examined. Although Henoch\u2013Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common disease causing vascular purpura in children, we confirmed diagnoses of cryofibrinogenemia after an extensive survey [10]. Other children complained of long-term and recurring pain at multiple sites on the body, with symptoms such as arthralgia, myalgia, bone pain, numbness, abdominal pain, and headache; however, these have even been regarded as psychiatric problems.",

Although most cases (87.5%) in this study is secondary cryofibrinogenemia, the abnormal rate of autoimmune antibody is relatively low. In our study, autoantibodies are usually negative in the initial stage and became positive after treatment. Thus, we speculated that autoantibodies are fixed in the vessel walls and released into circulation after treatment; however, this requires further study.",

It is frequently a fulminant inflammatory hemorrhagic demylination of the CNS white matter. Death from brain edema is common within one week of the onset of encephalopathy. The pathogenesis is known as acute vasculitis with subsequent vessel occlusion [12]. The patient here (Case 8) with AHEM presented with consciousness disturbance and repeated seizures.
