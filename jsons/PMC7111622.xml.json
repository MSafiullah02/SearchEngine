At the beginning of a country\u2019s agricultural development, food is produced almost solely for household or family use, with high labour to output ratio. With most of the population engaged in the same task there were no markets for agricultural goods, and thus no incentives to produce a surplus. However, as non-agricultural sectors are created and cities spring up, the motivation to grow a surplus in exchange for consumer goods develops. In the case of SSA, in a highly developed and globalized era, the agricultural sector was able to access new external capital and markets, along with new production and transportation technologies. This led to a shift in agriculture, displacing rural subsistence farming with more \u2018corporate\u2019-style supply production that included an emphasis on export cash crops. In addition, the acquisition of new capital to substitute machinery for labour accelerated urban drift; growing the demand for an agricultural surplus. The absolute and relative population in the agricultural sector is continuing to decline, ultimately leading to larger, more capital-intensive farming schemes. This cycle of agricultural intensification and reduced human input has contributed to rural\u2013urban migration patterns; escalating urbanization rates. While further historical accounts of these pathways are needed, Tiffen\u2019s accounts are instructive.",

One estimate has suggested that 65% of the SSA population reside in slums10; while UN Habitat has proposed that more than 70% of the urban population have inadequate access to housing, water supply, and sanitation.17 A 2013 World Bank report demonstrated that the development of mega cities was associated with faster economic growth, but higher income inequality.18\n",

The overriding responsibility of transnational food corporations (TFCs) to their stakeholders requiring that they maximize investor returns, usually by increasing profits, gives industry only two options; push more product or improve profit margins.19., 20. The most profitable items in this industry are highly processed products, including fast food, snacks, and beverages that are made up of large amounts of starch, sugars and low-quality fats.19 Furthermore, it is also reasonable to assume that brands cannot easily be built up around fruits and vegetables, thus items such as the \u201cBig Mac\u201d, \u201cWhopper\u201d, or \u201cBlizzard\u201d, become favourable for their capacity to be personalized and build brand loyalty in emerging markets. Healthy food as a \u2018bad\u2019 global commodity and unhealthy food as a \u2018good\u2019 global commodity (branding, long shelf life, value-added processing) have become the prevailing paradigm. Thus, the two revenue streams of TFCs, more product and more profitable products, have contributed to rising rates of overweight and obesity worldwide.21\n",

Furthermore, they approximated that a healthier diet cost 69% more than an unhealthy one, rendering it unaffordable for approximately 80% of the population. Consequently, due to changes in availability, accessibility, and utilization, urban dwellers, particularly the urban poor, are consuming diets of greater variety and energy intake, but ultimately lower in micronutrient quality,22 generally leading to increased rates of overweight and obesity.",

            "text": "The liberalization of trade and FDI has introduced measures that have the capacity to help or hinder improved food security in SSA. Under the World Trade Organization (WTO), treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Agreement on Agriculture, can improve food availability through the reduction of import barriers, which help bring international food imports into the domestic market at lower prices.36., 37. Alternatively, increasingly affordable imports may be paralleled by the conversion of traditional domestic production to export-oriented production, or \u2018cash crops\u2019. This is due in part to the legacy of colonial influences that prioritized production of coffee, copra, cotton, sesame, peanuts, and sugar, for export to Western markets.21., 38. Integration into global food markets deepened with the imposition of structural adjustment programs (SAPs), instituted primarily by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, targeted privatisation and liberalization as forms of expenditure-reduction and revenue-generating policies to restore economic balance and repay international loans. SAPs contributed to the reduced availability of traditional food crops, and increased exposure to a Western diet of refined sugars, wheat, and prepared food products which have been implicated time and again in the development of NCDs in SSA.38 This dietary shift is also attributed to the continued agricultural export subsidies that allow developed countries to artificially suppress food prices making it difficult for domestic markets in developed countries to compete.39 Increased quantities of cheap food imports and cash-crop exports create conditions of import-dependency and threaten short- and long-term food security.40., 41., 42. Growing national food insecurity is illustrated by the rise in the number of developing countries that are now net food importers (from 74 in the 1995\u20131999 to 89 in the 2005\u20132009 periods).43\n",

However, a brief look at South Africa is revealing. South Africa has fully liberalized the commercial presence of services related to agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing, wholesale trade, retailing, and franchising, without stipulation regarding market access or national treatment. While direct causal relationships are difficult to demonstrate, the country\u2019s current obesity epidemic, with as much as 65.4% and 31.3% of their population reported to be overweight and obese, respectively,46 may speak volumes to its adoption of the global food system.",

Of particular concern is the growing number of Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPAs). South Africa has presently signed 22 BIPAs, all of which contain an investor\u2013state dispute settlement clause, allowing foreign private investors to initiate arbitration if they believe their investment has been expropriated by new public legislation or regulation. While expropriation is customarily allowed for a public purpose, under BIPAs this would require compensation. Important here is that expropriation includes regulatory measures enacted by the state in the protection of public interest which may diminish the value of their investment. This raises numerous concerns regarding the regulation of the food industry and the potential for lawsuits surrounding lost profits if, for example, nations were to ban the sale of processed food items in school cafeterias. A full exploration of the BIPAs, beyond the scope of this paper, is nonetheless necessary for a more complete understanding of the potential ramifications for the food industry in SSA, and to provide guidance to those countries considering future investment agreements.",

An examination of its food imports and exports provides a clear picture of Cameroon as a net food importing country, with import levels rising rapidly in all categories between 1995 and 2012, with the exception of meats, and vegetables and fruit (see Fig 3A). In regard to vegetables and fruit, Cameroon is a net exporter, with export levels on the rise. Where people are purchasing their food is changing; grocery retailers\u2019 sales have climbed from approximately $2.98 billion in 2001\u201303 to $5.49 billion in 2010\u201312 (see Fig 4\n). Cameroon has seen an increase in total calories available daily per capita, up from 2064 in 1995\u201397 to 2451 in 2007\u201309 (see Fig 5\n). The majority of their dietary calories are still available from cereals and roots, with animal and vegetable oils generally increasing; suggesting they are only beginning to enter the nutrition transition. Fig 6\ndemonstrates that Cameroon\u2019s overweight and obesity prevalence is also rising, with recent rates as high as 33.2% and 12.6%, respectively. This trend, coupled with the knowledge that 22% of Cameroon\u2019s population is classified as undernourished,62 suggests that the food supply reaching the population may be of poor nutritional quality, and/or diminished in caloric value. Cameroon struggles with food affordability, such that the average household spends 52.3% of their total household expenditures on food, well above the global average of 38.8%.62 While mortality rates due to diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, and cardiovascular disease appear to be declining over time (see Fig 7\n), in 2008 NCDs accounted for approximately 31% of all mortality.46\n",

Over the 1995\u201397 to 2009\u201312 period South Africa continued to increase its exports in beverages and fish and seafood, with small declines in sugar exports (see Fig 3D). At the same time they increased cereal, dairy, and in particular, meat product imports. Of our four countries, South Africa has the highest annual grocery store retail sales, rising from $13.5 billion in 2001\u201303 to $43.6 billion in 2010\u201312 (see Fig 4). Additionally, Fig 8\ndemonstrates that consumer food service sales are primarily accounted for through independent grocery retailers, followed by fast food chains, grocery store chains, restaurants (not falling into another category), cafes and bars, street stalls, and take-out/delivery food, all of which have been increasing to varying degrees. South Africa has the highest total caloric availability daily per capita, up from 2809 in 1995\u201397 to 3002 in 2007\u201309 (see Fig 5). While their diet is still primarily cereals and roots, the larger role of oils, meats and fats, and sugars, demonstrates their advanced standing in the nutrition transition in SSA. Parallel to these findings, South Africa has some of the highest rates of overweight and obesity in the region; Euromonitor approximates that in 2010\u201312 32.7% and 22.7% of the population were overweight or obese, respectively. These estimates are considerably more conservative than the previously reported WHO estimates (65.4% and 31.3%), highlighting some of the data issues in the SSA region; however the Euromonitor estimates were kept for consistency within the trend analysis. That said, South Africa is a country of vast inequalities, with a Gini income coefficient of 0.631, where 1.0 represents maximal inequality and most OECD countries are around 0.3 or less.64 South Africa\u2019s income inequality is the second highest worldwide just behind Lesotho at 0.632.65 Not surprisingly, 27% of their population is classified as undernourished and, despite food affordability and availability being generally good on average, there are huge inequities in access.62 Mortality rates due to NCDs appear to be stagnant or, in the case of diabetes mellitus, increasing (see Fig 7); NCDs accounted for approximately 29% of all mortality in 2008,46 similar to three other country profiles.",

The per capita access to daily caloric intake is rising, with the exception of Kenya, where it has largely remained stagnant. Data from all four countries examined revealed that they were rapidly increasing their imports in cereal/cereal products and sugar/sugar products/honey; major contributors to energy-dense, processed foods. While Cameroon, Kenya, and Nigeria appear to only be entering the nutrition transition, South Africa\u2019s caloric consumption patterns and obesity epidemic presage a bleak future for SSA countries following in its footsteps. The trend towards rising prevalence of overweight and obesity coupled with declining death rates attributable to NCDs, with the exception of diabetes mellitus, was surprising at first. Upon further reflection it seems highly probable that this finding could be accounted for by SSA\u2019s rapid population growth (2.7% annually81). Data represented over the population, such as those presented here, i.e., the number of NCD deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, mean that growth in the numerator (total NCD deaths) must outpace growth in the denominator (total population), in order for such statistics to reveal change. Utilizing mortality as an endpoint, rather than morbidity, means that it will take some time for NCDs to cause death. Even assuming an aging population, the overall population growth (which still remains substantial in SSA) would have the effect of lowering mortality rates, unless the portion of people dying from NCDs outpaced the proportional rise in overall population. Importantly, this does not mean that the proportion of overall deaths due to NCDs is declining. Thus, future analyses may benefit from examining the change in percentage of deaths attributable to NCDs rather than the absolute numbers averaged over a growing population.",

This is a particularly concerning phenomenon in developing regions, such as SSA, entering a rapid nutrition transition, wherein fetal adaptations to an early nutrient-limited environment increases later life susceptibility to noncommunicable disease.82 Future food security strategies must address equitable access to healthy caloric availability in SSA; an increased volume of calories alone is no longer sufficient for realizing global food security goals.",

The GAP-NCDs contains nine voluntary global targets, including broad goals such as, a 25% relative reduction in risk of premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases; and goals pertaining to the reduction of known risk factors, such as a 30% relative reduction in mean population intake of salt/sodium.

It recommends the creation of policies to improve the availability, affordability and acceptability of healthier food products, particularly within public institutions, such as schools, other educational institutions and the workplace.

Additionally, global strategies such as the GAP-NCD have seemingly yet to acknowledge the potential for diminished capacity to act through regulatory strategies, such as those directed at the food industry, due to the protection provided to investors through international investment treaties. As has been suggested here, the growing number of bilateral and regional investment promotion and protection agreements raises serious concerns regarding the autonomy of the nation state to protect public health without facing retribution for expropriation of investment due to regulatory measures. Those committed to health-based public policy have thus had new challenges emerge; they now need to enhance their understanding of and participation in trade and investment treaties to ensure that sufficient capacity and space for effective public health regulation are protected. As WHO Director-General, Dr. Margaret Chan, challenged delegates at the 8th World Conference on Health Promotion in Helsinki, Finland, in June 2013:The globalization of unhealthy lifestyles is by no means just a technical issue for public health. It is a political issue. It is a trade issue. And it is an issue for foreign affairs\u2026 [I]t is not just Big Tobacco anymore. Public health must also contend with Big Food, Big Soda, and Big Alcohol. All of these industries fear regulation, and protect themselves by using the same tactics\u2026 Not one single country has managed to turn around its obesity epidemic in all age groups. This is not a failure of individual will-power. This is a failure of political will to take on big business. I am deeply concerned by two recent trends. The first relates to trade agreements. Governments introducing measures to protect the health of their citizens are being taken to court, and challenged in litigation. This is dangerous. The second is efforts by industry to shape the public health policies and strategies that affect their products. When industry is involved in policy-making, rest assured that the most effective control measures will be downplayed or left out entirely.\n",

While there may exist a theoretical foundation for the proposed pathways, cross-sectional, ecological data preclude definitive assertions of causality. It is also possible that there were potentially important confounding variables omitted from the model that may better explain changing proportions of CVD deaths. That being said, we believe that there is a strong literature base supporting the inclusion of our selected variables. Additionally, there is a concern regarding the ability to access high-quality, comprehensive datasets on African nations. For example, the current data were limited to CVD mortality rates, an outcome that may take an excessive period of time to demonstrate change. Future work would benefit from examining non-fatal outcomes and morbidity statistics, such as diabetes prevalence, hypertension, or non-fatal cardiac events, if the data were to become available. Lack of transparency from TFCs and retailers, and inadequate monitoring of population consumption patterns make it difficult to directly assess changes in the food environment. A global effort to monitor changes in product-specific retail sales, marketing and advertising, FDI into the food manufacturing and processing industry, and other indicators of dietary change and nutrition transition will be imperative to policy efforts targeting unhealthy food environments. Improved longitudinal monitoring of NCD risk factors and outcomes in SSA, such as the work being conducted by the WHO\u2019s Global Burden of Disease group will permit development of more advanced models in future research.",

As demonstrated by the work in Canada and the United States, two countries that have been actively targeting the tobacco epidemic, the reductions they are achieving in CVD and NCD deaths through tobacco regulation are being offset or diminished by rising overweight and obesity epidemics. Global strategies for reducing tobacco consumption, such as the ground-breaking international treaty led by the WHO, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, should be looked to for potential strategies to address the global obesity epidemic.",

This is not a new finding, as economic growth is known to change both food consumption patterns and exposure to new food products. What is compelling is the finding that global economic integration via trade and investment liberalization is also positively related to these outcomes, over and above economic growth. National and regional policy discussions, while informed by the WHO\u2019s GAP for NCDs, must also attend to the impact of trade and investment liberalization policies on intermediate risk factors, as well as the potential of such treaties to limit policy space for public health regulation.83., 40., 84., 85. This requires careful analyses (health impact assessments) of present trade and investment treaties to ensure that governments in their NCD control programs fully utilize existing policy flexibilities within these treaties. These include using compulsory licensing or parallel importing for access to generic drug treatments, restricting in non-discriminatory ways imports of unhealthy food products while reducing tariffs on imports of healthy foods, reviewing investment treaties to ensure that intellectual property rights are not considered in the definition of \u2018investment\u2019 and considering, as is the case in South Africa, not renewing such investment treaties that may be expiring. It also means ensuring that any new trade or investment treaty is carefully drafted to protect policy space for future public health regulation. These are not activities that most physicians, and certainly cardiovascular specialists, are familiar with. However, most countries have active academic and civil society organizations attempting to move forward this agenda, which could benefit in their work from the support of the medical community. This support could extend to health professional participation in trade, policy and health policy forums convened by such governments or civil society groups and, in the latter case, consideration to some direct financial assistance for their work. At a minimum, physicians and specialists need to recognize that managing CVD risk requires far more than managing individual behaviour choices.",
