            "text": "People with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) are a vulnerable health population that does not receive adequate attention within public health research and intervention/efforts. 1,2 An estimated 2.6 to 4 million people within the noninstitutionalized United States (US) population have an intellectual or developmental disability (IDD). 3, 4 In the US, developmental disabilities typically include more common disabilities such as intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and Down syndrome, in addition to more rare developmental disabilities, such as fragile X and Prader-Willi syndromes. 5 Previous studies have identified that people with IDD have higher prevalence of specific co-morbidities, such as hypertension, heart disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes, 6 which are identified as risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19. 7, 8 To date, there appear to be only three reports of COVID-19 death trends among individuals with IDD. An article in the New York Times 9 details that as of April 6, 2020, the COVID-19 death rate among adults with IDD receiving residential services in the state of New York was 9.5%, 9 compared to a substantially lower overall death rate from COVID-19 in New York State at 4.0%. 10 Two reports from European countries indicate similar to lower death rates among people with IDD. Utilizing an online database that registers COVID-19 cases among people with IDD in the Netherlands, an Academic Collaborative at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen 11 report a 13% death rate as of May 15, 2020, compared to the overall COVID death rate in the Netherlands at 12.9%. 12 As of May 11, 2020, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare reports a death rate of 7.7% among individuals with IDD receiving governmental housing support, 12 compared to an overall COVID death rate in Sweden of 12.7%. 13 This paucity of data on COVID-19 trends among the IDD population further exposes the reality that there is no adequate surveillance structure in place to monitor COVID-19, or other public health outcomes, among the IDD population. 14 This is even more disconcerting during this time in which populations with higher prevalence of identified co-morbidities, such as people with IDD, may be at increased risk of developing severe outcomes, including death, from COVID-19. 15, 16 While this overarching flaw in the public health structure cannot be remedied at this time, it is appropriate to utilize all available administrative data, especially data inclusive of ICD-10 diagnoses codes, on individuals with IDD 17 in order to better understand the effects of COVID-19. Therefore, utilizing a real-time database of electronic medical records, TriNetX, we compared COVID-19 death rates and co-morbidities between individuals with and without IDD, overall and by age group. Our hypotheses were that 1) people with IDD would have higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions associated with higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outcomes, and 2) the COVID-19 case-fatality rate would be higher for individuals with than without IDD individuals with IDD.",

Trends in number of cases, number of deaths, and case-fatality rates were then compared between groups. Age distributions for number of cases and number of deaths were computed for both patient groups. Deaths occurring within 30 days of the date of first COVID-19 documentation in the EMR were identified and used to calculate case-fatality rates and 95% confidence intervals. Age groups were selected based upon the knowledge that COVID-19 rates are substantially lower among children, 16 and that a disproportionately lower percent of adults with IDD live into older age. 20 All statistical analyses were conducted on the TriNetX platform, which utilizes a combination of JAVA\u2122, R, 21 and Python\u2122 programming languages.",

However, the COVID-19 case-fatality rate was higher for patients with IDD at younger ages. For patients age 0-17, the case-fatality rate was 1.6% among patients with IDD and <.1% among patients without IDD. For those ages 18-74, the case-fatality rate was 4.5% among patients with IDD and 2.7% among patients without IDD.",

            "text": "In this analysis of the TriNetX data during this pandemic, we partially confirm our hypotheses. People with a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, who also had an IDD diagnosis, demonstrated higher rates for all pre-existing conditions associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality (circulatory, endocrine, pulmonary), across all age groups. Although overall case-fatality rates were similar for those with (5.1%) and without (5.4%) IDD, people with IDD had higher case-fatality rates within the 18-74 years age range (5.4%) compared to those without IDD (2.7%), and also in the 0-17 years age group, but not among those 75 years and older. Though not testable with the current data, results from this study point to two mechanisms that may inform differences in COVID-19 death rates between people with and without IDD and should be explored in future research: 1) differences in the co-morbidity rates between those with and without IDD that was observed in this study; 2) a possible heterogeneity of frailty effect, with a disproportionate percentage of adults with IDD dying at younger ages resulting in similar morbidity and mortality outcomes for adults with and without IDD at older ages. 20, 22 Results from this study highlight the importance of accounting for age related differences in COVID-19 death rates. The prior reports of higher COVID-19 death rates for people with IDD reported by the New York Times, and lower to similar death rates in Sweden and the Netherlands, respectively, do not detail rates by age group. Thus, it is difficult to compare our results to these reports. Yet, it is important to note that case-fatality rates in this study were similar for people with and without IDD when not accounting for age, but considerably different when accounting for age. In addition, comparisons between reports are not advisable due to differences in governmental responses between countries, and differences in the types of samples (i.e. the New York Times report only included individuals with IDD living in congregate settings).",

As with the majority of studies that utilize health records to analyze IDD trends, the TriNetX data includes a small number of IDD cases, limiting our ability to further specify age groups. In addition, the TriNetX platform does not represent the general population, but rather represents only those people who seek medical care within the 42 health care organizations in the network. Within the database for this report, there is a much larger representation from the US especially for people with IDD; within the US, more cases are from systems in the Northeast and Midwest. We are also unable to control for any confounding effects which could influence risk for death. To minimize that effect, we did stratify by age. There are always possible inaccuracies within EMR data related to coding or data entry errors. Because of the statistical analyses built into the platform, we were limited in our choice of variables and statistical tests. We were unable to clearly establish deaths documented as being specifically related to COVID-19, and thus we determined death as documentation up to 30 days post diagnosis of COVID-19 to minimize deaths related to other causes, but possibly missing COVID-19 related deaths outside this time frame. In addition, the TriNetX platform does not allow for statistical testing of differences in demographic and comorbidity characteristics.",

Results from this study also point to distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD. The agerelated distribution of COVID-19 cases peaked for both groups at ages 18-74, but was comparatively higher for those with IDD at ages 0-17, and comparatively lower at ages 75 and over. In addition, the age-related distribution of COVID-19 deaths peaked earlier, at ages 18-74, for those with IDD, compared to ages 75 and older for those without IDD. Further emphasizing age related differences, people with IDD had a comparatively higher case-fatality rate than those without IDD at ages 0-17 and 18-74, but a similar case-fatality rate at ages 75 and over. Future work must continue to monitor COVID-19 trends among this and other disability groups with all available data sources, paying particular attention to age related trends when possible. ",
