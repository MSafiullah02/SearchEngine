Twelve years later, conditions for those working in the food system have only gotten worse. The rapacious pillage of territory that belongs to other people through land-grabs and exploitation of workers from other countries have proceeded at an accelerated pace so that wealthy people in the US can eat whatever they want and pay artificially low prices for food. The US is even farther away from ensuring economic, social and cultural rights for every person. The coronavirus has illuminated the dangers of ignoring human rights and failing to protect the commons of public health, while the concurrent climate emergency has shown us that humans are not \"essential workers\" from the perspective of the planet and its other inhabitants.",

All people deserve healthy food, produced in sustainable ways that don't mortgage our future. This means ensuring that every school child receives nutritious food for every meal, but also that anyone who is out of work, incapacitated, mentally ill or otherwise vulnerable has the same. We have made a good start with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, but such programs cannot be held hostage to Congressional or Presidential mean-spiritedness. And these programs can purchase all or nearly all of their food from local farmers using sustainable farming practices, to strengthen city-region links and support struggling farmers.",

We simply cannot continue supporting an industrial agriculture that is destroying soil fertility with synthetic fertilizers, overproducing commodity crops and driving down prices that farmers receive, exterminating insects and songbirds, contaminating soil and water, and tying up land in monocultures. Anyone who wants to raise food for her family should have access to fertile land and other resources needed; knowledge about agroecology (including organic, regenerative and other diversified farming practices) should be widely shared; and farmers should be supported in making a transition to agroecological practices.",
