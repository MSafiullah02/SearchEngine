At the time of writing, there were nearly 2 million COVID-19 cases causing approximately 110 000 deaths across more than 200 affected countries and territories (2) . As some health care systems approach collapse, a pressing need exists for tools modeling the capacity of acute and critical care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These estimates represent the maximum steadystate constraints imposed by these limited resources being managed by a health care system or hospital.

On the basis of published data, the average length of stay in acute care and critical care was set at 11 and 9 days, respectively, whereas the average length of time for mechanical ventilation was set at 9 days (1, 3, 4) . The tool then calculates the population-weighted age-stratified probabilities of COVID-19 cases requiring acute care hospitalization and critical care, and in the base case assumes that 70% of critical care patients will be mechanically ventilated (3) (4) (5) . Finally, the maximum number of new COVID-19 cases per day that a health care system could manage is calculated by dividing the daily turnover of maximally available acute care beds, critical care beds, or mechanical ventilators by the probability of each resource being used among COVID-19 cases. The tool outputs maximum numbers of manageable cases per day separately for acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators (Figure 1 ), so that health systems can determine the limiting resource at steady state ( Figure 2 ) and consider system adjustments, such as allocating more acute and critical care resources to COVID-19.",

The figure shows the COVID-19 patient-flow dynamics in the Ontario health system when each resource (acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators) available to patients with COVID-19 is in full use and at steady state. In this example, 2847 COVID-19 cases per day would result in 761 of those cases being admitted or transferred to acute care (\"patients in\"), assuming that 26.7% of all COVID-19 cases require acute care. Assuming that 8378 acute care beds are available for patients with COVID-19, with an average stay of 11 days in acute care, we can expect 761 patients with COVID-19 to leave acute care per day (\"patients out\") when at capacity (either by transfer, discharge, or death). If the province of Ontario reaches 2847 new COVID-19 cases per day, the acute care system would be at capacity and steady state, because the number of patients with COVID-19 entering and exiting the acute care system would be equal at 761 (patients in = patients out). Also shown are the same steady-state scenarios for critical care beds and mechanical ventilators for Ontario. The calculation can be broken down into 3 steps to estimate the maximum number of manageable COVID-19 cases per day that can occur for each resource (acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators). First, calculate the daily turnover of a resource when in maximal use: TO res = N res /LOU res , where TO res is the number of resource units that become available per day (turnover) for patients with COVID-19, N res is the total number of units of that resource available for patients with COVID-19, and LOU res is the mean length of use of that resource for patients with COVID-19. Second, calculate the proportion of COVID-19 cases that require a resource: P res \u03ed i \u03ed 1 N P i \u03eb P i,res where P res is the proportion of COVID-19 cases that require that resource, P i is the proportion of COVID-19 cases that are within age group i of N age groups, and P i,res is the proportion of COVID-19 cases within age group i that require that resource. Third, calculate the maximum number of new COVID-19 cases per day that can occur such that the daily number of COVID-19 cases requiring a resource is equal to the daily turnover of that resource: C max,res = TO res /P res , where C max,res is the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases that can occur for that resource and TO res and P res have been defined previously. * Number of existing acute or critical care resources for patients with COVID-19.",
