Typical and atypical forms of severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) represent the most severe form of CID. Based on newborn screening (NBS) results in eleven of the United States of America (USA), typical and atypical SCID were found to affect 1/58000 newborns [3]. However, a recent study from Kuwait showed an estimated occurrence of 1/7500 live births which was attributed to the high rate of consanguineous marriages [4].",

            "text": "V(D)J recombination is crucial for the assembly and expression of T and B lymphocyte antigen receptors and promoting the differentiation of T and B lymphocytes. V(D)J recombination is initiated by binding of the recombination-activating gene products RAG1 and RAG2 to the recombination signal sequences (RSSs) flanking the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) coding elements of the B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) genes and inducing a DNA double strand break, leaving hairpin structure at coding ends [5]. Upon phosphorylation by the DNA protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) complex, ARTEMIS, which is encoded by the gene DCLRE1C is recruited, and mediates hairpin opening via its endonuclease activity [6]. Joining of the coding ends (as well as of the excised signal ends) is then accomplished by proteins of the non-homologous end-joining pathway. Accordingly, null mutations in RAG1/2 or DCLRE1C affect the development of T and B lymphocytes, causing T\u2212\n B\u2212 SCID. However, hypomorphic mutations in the same genes may cause milder phenotypes [5], [6].",

After incubation, stabilization and fixation of the stained cells were performed by adding Immunoprep kit reagents (Beckman Coulter, USA). The analysis of the lymphocyte subsets was performed with an EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer (15 mW) (Beckman Coulter Electronics, FL) equipped with an argon ion laser that was tuned to a wavelength of 488 nm. The values of the lymphocyte subpopulations were determined as a percentage of mononuclear cells. Absolute values of the lymphocyte subsets (counts per \u03bcl) were determined via the addition of flow count fluorospheres (Beckman Coulter, USA). We performed a fluorescence gating strategy, using CD45+ vs. side scatter. Internal quality assurance was performed using optical alignment beads, which are compensation reagents that are used to eliminate bleed through fluorescence, and Immunotrol control cells.

Five patients were screened by flowcytometry and diagnosed early in life because of family history of the disease while 5 patients were diagnosed due to the typical OS features. Infectious manifestations were the most common, affecting the majority of patients as follow: bacterial (15 patients, 71%), viral (14 patients, 67%) and fungal (11 patients, 52%).

Despite the fact that HSCT is currently the only available curative treatment for defects in RAG1/2 or DCLRE1C, only 38% of the patients received such treatment since it is not available in Kuwait for children. Furthermore, only 50% of the patients who were treated with HSCT survived the procedure. It is well known that HSCT for (S)CID before the age of 3.5 months results in a superior outcome [32]. The median age at HSCT in our cohort was 11.5 months (6\u201324 months) compared to 7 months in patients treated in the United States [33]. The median time from diagnosis to HSCT in our cohort was 6 months (2\u201318 months) compared to < 2 months in the United States [34] and < 3 months in the Netherlands [12]. This delay was due to the arrangements needed to transfer the patients to other centers outside Kuwait and has resulted in an increased occurrence of infections and tissue damage which are known to negatively affect HSCT outcome [34]. Schuetz et al. studied complications in transplanted RAG- and ARTEMIS-deficient patients and showed that the latter group had a significantly higher occurrence of infections in long-term follow-up and they also had poor growth, abnormalities in dental development and endocrine late effects especially in association with the use of alkylating agents [35]. This fact documents that the peculiarities of HSCT for patients with V(D)J recombination defects.
