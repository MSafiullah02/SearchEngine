We do not know anything about neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections, and we must reasonably follow data from adult critical care. First, testing all NICU-admitted neonates for SARS-CoV-2 represents a wrongful use of resources. Neonatal respiratory failure can result from a wide range of causes, and testing everybody when other causes are reasonably suspected will divert laboratory resources from adult critical care. Tests should be done for infants from families infected by SARS-CoV-2 or exposed to other infected people, irrespective of their symptoms.",

It might be done in a single room, without full NICU capabilities, according to local settings. Admitting all neonates to NICU would be similar to admitting all positive adults to an ICU, whereas strict admission criteria and prioritisation are needed and not yet universally implemented.2 A general ICU admission might lead to mistakes in epidemiological data and overestimation of the severity of the disease, and it is important to reserve NICU beds for patients who are in life-threatening situations.",

Epidemiologically, the priority is to diagnose neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) according to the age-specific definition (the so-called Montreux definition of neonatal ARDS3) and use it to classify clinical severity. This allows production of solid epidemiology data and comparisons between paediatric and adult ARDS statistics. Therapeutics should be used on a case-by-case basis. Respiratory support policy should be guided by a physiology-driven approach and follow the best evidence available in paediatric critical care, according to international guidelines.4\n",
