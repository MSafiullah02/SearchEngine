The situation was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) China office on December 31, 2019 as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in the city of Wuhan (population ~11 million) in the Hubei province.1,2,3,4 The disease was believed to have originated in a seafood market, which was closed for disinfection on January 1, 2020. Of 44 cases reported on January 3, 2020, 11 patients had severe disease while 33 patients were stable.2,3 On January 7, 2020, it was determined that the epidemic was caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV). Thailand reported its first case on January 13 and Japan on January 15, while on January 20 the first case was reported in Korea and 6 were reported dead in the city of Wuhan. Later, it appeared in countries such as the United States, Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, and spread to the European nations, starting with France on January 25, 2020. The WHO reported that the first cases in Wuhan had been infected via animals, after which the virus was transmitted from person to person and detected in clusters among families.3 On January 30, 2020, the epidemic was recognized as a public health emergency of international concern, and on February 11, 2020, the WHO named the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the new virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the WHO declared the coronavirus epidemic a pandemic on March 12.4 On April 2, the WHO website reported 896,450 infected individuals worldwide, 206 affected countries, and 45,526 deaths globally.5",

As the epidemic spread to other countries, screening was expanded to include passengers from countries with reported cases, and any individuals showing signs of coronavirus infection were quarantined. In February, flights to all countries with growing outbreaks were suspended. In the first week of March, hand disinfectant stations were placed in mass transit and public areas in some provinces. The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was announced by the Ministry of Health on March 10, 2020. Schools were closed on March 13 and some other precautions were implemented, such as not allowing spectators at sporting events and requiring special permission for government personnel to leave the country. The first COVID-related death in Turkey occurred on March 15, 2020. As of March 19, all sports, scientific, cultural, and artistic activities have been postponed. Lockdown measures were later introduced, first for individuals over the age of 65, then for those under the age of 20. On April 1, it was reported that 601 healthcare workers were infected and 1 physician had died.6 As of April 2, there were 18,135 infected individuals and 356 deaths in Turkey.",

It is less common and milder in children. The incubation period is 1-14 days (mean 5-6 days) and the classic signs and symptoms reported include high fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, and fatigue, with bilateral ground-glass opacity on chest tomography.12,13 The presence of conjunctivitis has not been reported in these studies. An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in late February evaluated the clinical symptoms and outcomes of 1,099 of the 7,736 patients who were hospitalized due to a diagnosis of COVID-19 in 552 hospitals in China through January 29, 2020.14 The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% were female, and the incubation period was 4 days. Only 0.9% of patients were under the age of 15, while 23.7% had a comorbidity such as hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most common symptom was fever (88.7%), followed by cough (67.8%). Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were rarely observed. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% and ground-glass opacities were observed on lung tomography in 56.4% of patients. Five percent of the patients were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% died. Conjunctival congestion was detected in 9 (0.8%) of the patients.14",

He later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that ocular infection was an alternative route of transmission of the virus.18 Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan, contracted the disease in early January after contact with a glaucoma patient and later lost his life.19 A report published in The Lancet in February 2020 and an editorial published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology in March stated that, in light of previous publications regarding coronavirus and SARS, the ocular surface is a potential target tissue for SARS-CoV-2 invasion.20,21 Certain coronaviruses are known to cause conjunctivitis in humans.22,23 Of the human coronaviruses, NL 63 (HCoV-NL63) was first isolated in an infant with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis,22 and a later publication reported that conjunctivitis was present in 17% (n=3) of 18 children with respiratory infection whose nasal swabs had tested positive for HCoV-NL63.23",

Eight of these patients were later serologically diagnosed with SARS, while tear samples of 3 patients (37.5%) tested positive by PCR. Tear test results were negative in the remaining suspected cases. It was reported that in all patients with positive tear PCR results, the samples had been collected at an early stage. The authors stated that collecting a tear sample is extremely simple and reproducible and that it can therefore be used for diagnostic purposes in the early stage. They noted that ophthalmologists and other healthcare professionals work within close proximity to patients\u2019 eyes and that this may be a source of infection, citing Goldmann applanation tonometry, contact lens fitting, and spectacle frames as potential transmitters of infection. They also stated that for this reason, healthcare workers\u2019 compliance with personal protective equipment guidelines (M3G: mask, gown, gloves, and goggles/face shield) is imperative during the examination and treatment of SARS patients.24 The debate still continues regarding how the SARS-CoV is found in tears.9 Mechanisms discussed include transmission through droplets, upstream passage from an upper respiratory tract infection through the nasolacrimal duct, and from hematogenous infection of the lacrimal gland.",

The nasopharyngeal swab and stool samples of 5 (29.4%) of the 17 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV when tested by PCR, while SARS-CoV could not be detected with RT-PCR or viral culturing in any of the tear/conjunctival swabs. Several possible explanations for the negative test results were suggested. The results may have been false-negatives, and collecting more samples could improve sensitivity, or the virus and its genetic material may be detectable in tears only in a short window during the disease, or the virus is not present in tears. The authors concluded that checking for the virus in tears or conjunctival swabs had no place in disease screening.24",

In a study conducted in China, Xia et al.26 collected tears, conjunctival swab, and saliva samples twice from 30 COVID-19 patients. Only the 2 samples from a patient with conjunctivitis tested positive in RT-PCR, while the other 58 tear samples tested negative. The patient with conjunctivitis was reported to have conjunctival congestion and serous discharge; however, the virus could not be isolated. Of the 60 saliva samples, 55 yielded positive results. The authors stated that even though the chance of virus being present in tear and conjunctiva samples is low, this does not mean that the conjunctiva cannot act as a portal of entry for the virus. Because ophthalmologists are within close range of patients during examination, the patient\u2019s saliva may splash on the face and cause infection, making the use of safety goggles an absolute necessity.",

Ocular symptoms were not observed in any of the patients, but 1 patient developed conjunctival redness and chemosis while in hospital. Although these results may seem comforting, they have led to arguments that the negative results could be attributed to the absence of active conjunctivitis at time of sample collection, the small number of conjunctiva and tear samples, and the fact that the samples were collected 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset, when there is lower virus load.28",

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are well-known drugs among ophthalmologists as they cause retinal toxicity with long-term use for the treatment of rheumatoid diseases. The AAO guidelines state that the risk of developing retinopathy within 10 years is extremely low if used at doses less than 5 mg/kg/day.36 In a study including 22 patients in France, COVID-19 positive patients were given 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine per day for 10 days and it was observed that virus load decreased by 50% when used alone and by up to 100% when used in combination with azithromycin.37 Although the dose cited by the Chinese group is much higher than the dose used in rheumatoid patients, they reported that short-term use (less than 2 weeks) will not cause any toxicity and that conducting detailed eye exams before and after this treatment during the pandemic is unnecessary.34",

Therefore, examination procedures such as ophthalmoscopy, biomicroscopy, and manifest refraction should not be performed without personal protective equipment. Disinfection of devices and instruments should be made a routine part of examination for all procedures that require contact with the ocular surface. All surfaces touched both inside and outside the office by patients during their visits, including the examination room and outside surfaces such as the handle of the entrance door, doorbell, and elevator buttons, require regular disinfection. Therefore, the number of patients should be reduced except for urgent cases that cannot be postponed. It is extremely important to educate patients in order to prevent infection via the ocular surface. Patients should be advised to stop rubbing their eyes habitually and to avoid all hand contact with the eyes before washing appropriately. Hygiene rules should be adhered to strictly, especially when using contact lenses, and the use of eyeglasses should be recommended instead if necessary.",
