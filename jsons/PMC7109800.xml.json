Owing to the limitation of proteomic data, most of the previous studies were focused on predicting intra-species PPIs, i.e. interactions within a single organism. In recent analysis, several improvements have been reported in PPI predictions between different organisms, i.e. inter-species. These types of PPI prediction methods offer important information for further analysis of infection mechanisms between different species. PPIs between virus and host proteins allow pathogenic microorganisms to manipulate host mechanisms to use host capabilities and to escape from host immune responses [5\u20138]. Therefore, a complete understanding of infection mechanisms through PPIs is crucial for the development of new and more effective therapeutics.",

Classical machine learning techniques are well-accepted tools for PPI predictions when there are sufficient numbers of known interactions. In contrast, prediction of inter-species (virus\u2013host) PPI is relatively young field of study, which requires new model-based approaches. To tackle the problem of data scarcity, eliciting and transferring data from related domains to a desired formulation can be a promising solution [26, 27]. Multitask learning [28\u201330] uses relationship among different domains and learns the problem simultaneously, which leads to a better performance rather conducting learning task on individual domain.",

They have implemented three filtering methods to obtain linear motif sets: (i) conserved in viral proteins (C), (ii) located in disordered regions (D) and (iii) rare or scarce in a set of randomized viral sequences (R). Finally, these three sets have used to find the disordered protein regions among the HIV-1 sequences and host sequences.

The EBOV genome consists of seven genes, namely, nucleoprotein (NP), viral polymerase complex protein 35 (VP35), matrix protein (VP40), glycoprotein (GP), minor NP (VP30), membrane-associated protein (VP24) and polymerase (L-protein) [66]. Among the seven genes of EBOV, GP is the only viral protein that is present on the EBOV surface and is responsible for mediating attachment to host cell surface receptors and entry of the virus into host cells. Mature GP is a trimer of three disulfide-linked GP1-GP2 heterodimers [67\u201369]. GP1 mediates adhesion of the virus to host cells and regulates GP2, which carries out membrane fusion [70\u201372]. The EBOV virus initially targets specific cell types, including liver cells, immune system cells and endothelial cells. EBOV GP can damage cell adhesion, so that cells do not remain attached to each other and to the extracellular matrix. By targeting liver cells, EBOV disrupts the mechanism of removal toxins from the bloodstream. The infection leads to organ failure, fever and severe internal bleeding, which ultimately leads to death [73].",

Specifically, EBOV GP allows the virus to introduce its contents into monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and/or endothelial cells [74\u201377], which causes the release of cytokines associated with inflammation and fever. EBOV GP has been found to be the most important factor required for EBOV entry into a host cell by binding to surface receptors on the host cell [78]. EBOV binds to human cells through various receptors expressed on the cell membrane surface\u2014C-type lectins, which interact with glycans on EBOV GP [79\u201384], phosphatidylserine receptors, which interact with phosphatidylserine on EBOV GP [85\u201392], and integrins [93\u201395]. The cholesterol transporter, Niemann\u2013Pick C1 (NPC1), facilitates EBOV entry into host cells and the release of the virus from the vacuole into the cytoplasm of the host [96, 97]. EBOV entry into endosomal compartments is primarily achieved through macropinocytosis, as well as other entry mechanisms, such as clathrin-dependent endocytosis [91, 98\u2013100].",

The GO terms for which this propTerms value is above a given threshold are selected as cluster centers. The threshold values for selecting cluster centers with respect to MF, CC and BP ontologies are given in Table 3. Depending on the interaction prediction result, the threshold values are chosen. Initially, threshold value is started from 0.1 and gradually increases. With the increasing threshold value, the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is determined with the varying k (width of Gaussian function) values (from 1 to 10). Finally, the threshold and k are chosen for which the AUC score is highest. After selecting the cluster centers, the degree of membership of a GO term to each of the selected cluster centers is calculated using its respective shortest path lengths to the corresponding cluster centers. The membership of the GO term to a cluster decreases with increase in its shortest path length to the cluster center. Next, using the difference in membership values of the GO terms t1 and t2 with respect to each cluster center, a weight parameter is defined as one minus the maximum membership difference value. This weight value determines how dissimilar two GO terms can be with respect to the cluster centers. Next, the average IC [117], of the DCAs of GO terms t1 and t2, is determined. Finally, the semantic similarity between the two GO terms t1 and t2 is defined as the product of the weight parameter and the average IC of the DCAs of the two GO terms.\n",

            "text": "In this article, we have reviewed the diverse level of host\u2013virus interaction predictions across the variety of pathogenic species and their human host. These computational methods may have important roles in paving the way of experimental verification of virus\u2013host interactions by highlighting high potential interactions. Depending on the availability of the required data, some virus\u2013host interaction mechanisms are well studied and targeted in more research. The main challenge for computational virus-interaction predictions is the lack of available verified interactions and the relevant feature information in most of the prediction methods. Finally, a case study-based analysis is proposed on EBOV\u2013human interaction prediction. Here, four different classifiers, DT Classifier [130], KNN Classifier [131], SVM [132] and GNB [133, 134], are used for predictions. In this approach, a cluster of potential human proteins is retrieved from the predicted novel interactions. These sets of proteins have close structural and semantic similarities with known EBOV GP human target proteins, and this may facilitate EBOV entry into host cells through interaction with EBOV GP. For defining the structural similarity feature, we use five scores, namely, TM-score [111], RMSD [112], MaxSub-score [113], GDT_score [114] and Tm-Rm score [Equation (1)]. The semantic similarity feature is determined by GO graph-based properties. The proteins predicted by this method are highly likely to interact with EBOV GP and facilitate EBOV entry into human cells. This method would enlighten the promising future direction for novel host\u2013virus interactions.",
