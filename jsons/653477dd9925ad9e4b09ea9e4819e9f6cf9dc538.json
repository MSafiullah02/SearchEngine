            "text": "The novel SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic in early 2020. The virus has shown a high reproduction number and has spread rapidly on a global scale, 1-2 with more than three million cases of coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) being diagnosed worldwide. 3 Italy was one of the first countries to face the epidemic outside of China. [4] [5] As of the end of April 2020, Italy is second only to the USA as the country with the highest number of COVID-19related deaths, with a total of around 30,000 deaths and a case fatality rate close to 13\u00b76%. 3 The spectrum of COVID-19 disease ranges from asymptomatic to severe mixed interstitial-alveolar pneumonia, that may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. 6 While several important epidemiological findings have emerged about the pandemic, the COVID-19 case-fatality rate (CFR) remains unknown. Reports from different countries show an enormous heterogeneity, ranging from less than 1% to approximately 12% CFR. 3, 7 The accuracy of this assessment, however, is limited by disease ascertainment challenges, bias towards symptomatic and very sick patients, and variability in testing accuracy. 8 An important source of this heterogeneity is very likely the difference in case detection and reporting (denominator) and also how COVID-19-related deaths are defined (numerator). Furthermore, the length of observation time is key to accurately measure CFR. [9] [10] [11] Where widespread screening was performed in the general population (e.g., in South Korea), the overall CFR is obviously lower, because the denominator includes many mild or asymptomatic cases. However, in countries where mainly people presenting to the emergency department are being screened (e.g., in the Italian region of Lombardy, during the strongest wave of the epidemic), CFRs are higher, because the denominator will include predominantly severe cases. 12 Two recent systematic reviews of trials and observational studies, including studies mainly from China, found a CFR pooled estimate of 3-4%; 13,14 however, most reports from European countries show CFRs ranging from 10% to 20% when a cohort approach with adequate follow up was conducted. 9, 15 Differences in CFR are also reported in studies including only hospitalized COVID-19 patients. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Reliable population-based estimates of the CFR for hospitalized patients are essential for providing public health standards to health care providers that have to monitor the impact of the epidemic and disease management. CFRs can also be useful to provide a reference standard to accurately design trials of interventions targeting COVID-19 with adequate statistical power. Having a reliable expected number of deaths in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with known age and comorbidity burden is critical to design adequately-powered experimental studies and, in particular, to design phase two, single-arm studies, that are currently very frequently employed in ongoing COVID-19 intervention trials. In particular, 729 interventional studies on COVID-19 patients are registered in clinicaltrials.gov as of 30 th April 2020 (supplementary figure 1 and table 1) . Of these, 37\u00b79% are phase II (including phase I/II and II/III) trials and one third of those studies are aimed at exploring survival as outcome (supplementary figure 2).",

The CFR can increase in some areas if there is a surge of infected patients, which adds to the strain on the healthcare system and can overwhelm its medical resources. 23 Data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York City show a CFR of 20% at approximately 6 days of follow-up; 19 although this figure seems much higher than our observed survival in the first week after hospital admission, if we consider that the average Charlson index in the New York population was over 4, the fatality rate is consistent with our estimate for the population with a Charlson index \u22653, reported in figure 2, which ranges between 20 and 25%.

Therefore, the excess morbidity and mortality is underestimated when we observe only hospitalized patients. Different hypotheses involving the role of ACE2 as principal receptor of SARS-CoV-2 for its entry into cells have been proposed to explain the higher susceptibility to infection and the lower survival in males. 26 The role of the TMPRSS2, a protease involved in virus binding and up-regulated by androgens, has been also proposed. 27 The impact of age on the risk of death after developing COVID-19 was dramatic in our cohort, in line with all previous studies. 7, 15 Again, the impact of age on survival could be partially underestimated when studying hospitalized cohorts, as older patients, at least until the age of 80, also have a higher risk of being hospitalized. The excess risk cannot be entirely attributed to the underlying comorbidities that are usually more frequent in older patients, as can be deduced comparing the survival curves of people with the same Charlson index in different age groups ( figure 4) . On the other hand, severe symptoms in children and adolescents seem extremely rare, and very few cases of death have been reported for children aged less than 10 years so far. 8, 28 The burden of comorbidities play an important role in determining the risk of death in COVID-19 patients in our cohort, confirming the results of all previous studies. 17, 18 The large number of cases identified allowed us to study the effect of comorbidity burden across age groups, giving a precise survival estimate by comorbidity in each age group. The effect of comorbidities on survival is much more pronounced in younger patients than in older ones. In our study design, the assessment of the pre-existing comorbidities is independent from the outcome being collected through the analysis of patient use of healthcare services in the years preceding the epidemic. Therefore, even if we may underestimate the presence of comorbidities, this misclassification is not differential in severe or fatal cases and in non-severe cases, thus the hazard ratios should be unbiased.",

Moreover, although patients might indeed have SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infection itself may not necessarily be the cause of death. Extreme examples include patients with metastatic cancer or terminal organ failure. 12 Due to the regional structure of the Italian NHS, the responses to the COVID-19 epidemic vary from region to region. The Lombardy region is home to a sixth of the Italian population (10\u00b708 million inhabitants) and accounts for 37% of cases and 53% of deaths of the country, as of 21 st April, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak initially hit Italy in two small towns, Codogno and V\u00f2 Euganeo, in Lombardy and Veneto, respectively. The two outbreaks developed differently: in Lombardy the spread of infection was quick and several other clusters emerged rapidly; 4 in Veneto, the first cluster had a limited spread until the diffusion of cases in all Northern Italian regions occurred. Finally, in Reggio Emilia the outbreak was related to the expansion of the first cluster occurring in the neighboring area of Codogno. Differences in the pattern of spread of the infection across the three areas are probably due to the different size of the initial clusters when they emerged, i.e. much larger in Codogno than in V\u00f2 Euganeo, but also on the epidemic control strategies which were implemented initially: Veneto opted for strict containment of the outbreak and piloted mass testing in selected areas, whereas Lombardy expanded hospital services to meet a massively increased need for hospitalization and beds in ICUs. 29 As result the proportion of positive tests on the total number of swabs performed was 20% in Lombardy, 5\u00b71% in Veneto and 13\u00b79% in Emilia-Romagna. Clinical criteria which must be met for COVID-19 hospital admission may vary among regions, principally due to a different organization of primary care and the availability of hospital beds, which varied in different places and moments of the epidemic, and availability of other options for managing less severe patients, such as home-based treatment with monitoring. Where special units for home-based care for COVID-19 patients were activated, patients were treated and followed-up at home, when possible. Nevertheless, differences in the overall CFRs among the three catchment areas at 30 days post-hospitalization in our cohort were modest, suggesting the generalizability of the results once the plateau is reached.",

Survival and CFR are very useful also for the design of phase II clinical trials and to calculate the adequate sample size for phase III clinical trials. We found a very high CFR, particularly in older people. Since this endpoint is very common, we suggest that future experimental studies investigating potential therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 patients should prioritize survival as a main outcome. Furthermore, we found that the fatality rate reaches a plateau 30 days after hospitalization, thus implying that studies should have at least one month of follow-up after COVID-19 hospitalization to properly observe deaths; studies with shorter followup may not capture all deaths related to COVID-19, ultimately leading to the overestimation of the potential benefit of COVID-19 interventions in phase II studies in absence of a comparator. Hard outcomes such as the CFR have a crucial role and, together with survival estimates, should guide healthcare leaders and policy makers in developing public health strategies at national and international levels. 23 ",

These registries were linked to the resident population registries. We report the percentage of patients successfully linked; in some cases, deterministic linkage could not be carried out, likely due to patients not residing in the region or to inaccurate individual data reporting in the COVID-19 registry. Patients confirmed to be residents in the region of interest were found using data from prior contact with the NHS. This data was used to identify comorbidities. ",

COVID-19 registries at the regional level collect, for all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients, data on date of diagnosis, symptoms, hospitalizations, death, and recovery. These registries were linked to the resident population registries. We report the percentage of patients successfully linked; in some cases, deterministic linkage could not be carried out, likely due to patients not residing in the region or to inaccurate individual data reporting in the COVID-19 registry. Patients confirmed to be residents in the region of interest were found using data from prior contact with the NHS. This data was used to identify comorbidities.",
