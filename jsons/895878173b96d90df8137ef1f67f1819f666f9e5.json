            "text": "Prolonged survival of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces and personal protective equipment (PPE) may lead to these surfaces transmitting disease to others. This article reports the effectiveness of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection system in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and exposed to different durations of PX-UV disinfection. For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3.53 Log10, >4.54 Log10, and >4.12 Log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4.79 Log10 reduction in viral load. We found that PX-UV significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. With the potential to rapidly disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, PX-UV devices are a promising technology for the reduction of environmental and PPE bioburden and to enhance both HCW and patient safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.",

A recent report examining the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the healthcare environment found that 13/15 (87%) room sites sampled were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 2 . SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated to survive on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 3 days 8 . This extensive spreading and prolonged survival opens the possibility of indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces, which is consistent with data from prior coronavirus outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Easters Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [9] [10] [11] [12] . Infection clusters of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, where no direct contact with an infected individual has occurred, but several persons in became infected 13, 14 .",

It is likely that in such clinical environments, the impact of the PX-UV in reducing environmental bioburden would be even greater.",

UV-C from a PX-UV system produces broad-spectrum wavelength light that covers the entire germicidal UV spectrum, from 200-280 nanometers (nm) 28 , potentially creating more viricidal effect than the wavelengths produced by these other narrow spectrum sources 29 .",

The experiments to test the antiviral effects of PX-UV robot model PXUV4D (Xenex Disinfection Services, San Antonio, Texas) on SARS-CoV-2 were performed at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute. Test surfaces (i.e., carriers) included a hard surface (8-well chamber slides) and a soft surface (N95 respirator, 3M Model 1860). Test surfaces were inoculated with 0.020 mL of virus, deposited in a single drop and spread with a pipette tip. Test surfaces were then dried for 55 minutes in a laminar flow hood under ambient conditions.",
