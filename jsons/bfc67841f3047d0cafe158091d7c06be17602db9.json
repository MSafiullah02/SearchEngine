Studies showed that alterations of its membrane-related components, including the transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic tail (CT), can reshape the antigenic structure of the Env ectodomain. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we determine the structure of an Env segment encompassing the TMD and a large portion of the CT in bicelles. The structure reveals that the CT folds into amphipathic helices that wrap around the C-terminal end of the TMD, thereby forming a support baseplate for the rest of Env. NMR dynamics measurements provide evidences of dynamic coupling across the TMD between the ectodomain and CT. Pseudovirus-based neutralization assays suggest that CT-TMD interaction preferentially affects antigenic structure near the apex of the Env trimer. These results explain why the CT can modulate the Env antigenic properties and may facilitate HIV-1 Env-based vaccine design.",

Its ectodomain density is in overall agreement with subsequent high-resolution structures, determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of a soluble form of the Env trimer stabilized by a disulfide crosslink between gp120 and gp41 [11] [12] [13] . Other cryo-EM structures of detergent-solubilized Env constructs with or without the CT has been reported [14] [15] [16] , but the MPER, TMD, and CT regions are all disordered in detergent micelles that probably failed to mimic a real membrane. We have recently determined the NMR structures of the trimeric MPER and TMD reconstituted in bicelles that mimic a lipid bilayer 8, 9 . In particular, the MPER matches well the low-resolution cryo-ET density near the membrane of the unliganded viral Env, suggesting the MPER conformation observed by NMR is consistent with the structure of prefusion Env on the virion 9 .",

The HIV-1 Env CT can be divided into distinct regions based on their biophysical properties ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ): a loop, commonly known as the Kennedy sequence (KS), followed by three segments predicted to form amphipathic \u03b1-helices, named lentivirus lytic peptide 2 (LLP2), LLP3, and LLP1 17 . Earlier studies suggested that the CT forms three membrane-bound amphipathic helices in an extended conformation 19, 20 . These structures are very informative about the secondary structures of the CT, but they fall short of explaining how truncation in the CT can influence the antigenic structure of the ectodomain on the opposite side of the membrane 5, 21, 22 . In this study, we used NMR to obtain high-resolution information of the HIV-1 Env CT folding in the context of the TMD and lipid bilayer. We find that the CT adopts a structure different from the previous model 19 that can explain the physical coupling between the CT and the ectodomain.",

To prepare an NMR sample suitable for structural analysis, we designed a protein construct derived from a clade D HIV-1 isolate 92UG024.2 (residues 677-788) that encompasses the TMD and a portion of the CT containing the KS and the LLP2. We first mutated the palmitoylation site C764 to serine (C764S) to avoid non-physiological disulfide formation. We then found that the KS (residues 710-738) was completely unstructured according to the NMR data and that removal of its central region (residues 726-736) did not affect the protein structure ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). This region was thus deleted to reduce NMR signal overlap. The final NMR construct, designated TMD-CT LLP2 , included residues 677-725 and 737-788. TMD-CT LLP2 is trimeric in DMPC-DHPC bicelles with q = 0.5 ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . Comparison of the NMR spectrum of the bicelle-reconstituted TMD-CT LLP2 with those of the MPER-TMD (residues 660-710) 9 and the TMD (residues 677-716) 8 used in previous studies showed that the peaks corresponding to the TM core (residues 685-700) are almost superimposable ( Supplementary Figs. 1c and 3a) , indicating that its structure is essentially identical in all three overlapping constructs. Therefore, the CT did not disrupt the TMD structure.",

One is the inter-chain proton-proton distance, derived from nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) using previously established protocols 9, 23 (see the Methods section and Supplementary Fig. 4) . The other is the plane restraint (confinement of an assigned atom in a plane) 24 , derived from NMR-based membrane partition analysis of the protein in bicelles 25 . The plane restraints are rarely used in NMR structure determination but useful here for constraining the CT segments that reside mostly on the plane of the bicelle. The residue-specific plane restraints were derived by (1) measuring solvent and lipophilic paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) amplitudes along the bicelle normal using the paramagnetic probe titration (PPT) method 25 , and (2) calibrating the PRE amplitudes against the established structure and membrane partition of the TMD (residues 678-710) 8, 26 (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The final structure of the TMD-CT LLP2 trimer was independently validated by inter-chain PRE analyses of multiple site-directed spin-labeling (Supplementary Fig. 6 ).",

The LLP2 is not a long continuous helix as previously proposed 19 ; instead it forms two helices, designated H1 (residues 741-764) and H2 (residues 769-786), adopting a ring-like structure around the C-terminal region of the TMD trimer. The three H1s make direct contacts with the TMD trimer to form an inner ring around the TMD (Fig. 1a, b) . The CT-TMD interactions involve the H1 nonpolar residues (L748 and L755), which form a hydrophobic cluster with TM residues (V701, L704, V705, and V708) of the same chain, and the polar H1 residue D759, which can make a salt bridge with the TM residue R709 of the neighboring chain. These residues thus collectively mediate the specific association between the CT ring and the TMD trimer. Indeed, hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange data confirmed that residues 704-706, which showed fast H-D exchange in the TMD construct 26 , are protected in the TMD-CT LLP2 sample, as expected ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . The three H2s fold around the inner ring at its periphery (Fig. 1a, c) . This folding appears to be driven mainly by hydrophobic interactions involving H2 residues (V778, I781, and V782) of one chain and H1 residues (I746 and V749) of the neighboring chain. Based on the membrane partition data (Fig. 1d) , H1s and H2s all reside in the headgroup region of the lipid bilayer. The palmitoylation site C764 (S764 in this construct) faces the lipid bilayer interior, consistent with its role in anchoring the LLP2 to the membrane.",

When reconstituted in bicelles, the CT LLP2 did not trimerize according to the OG-label analysis 27 (Supplementary Fig. 9a ). In contrast, when reconstituted in the presence of the TMD-KS, the CT LLP2 trimerized ( Supplementary Fig. 9b ) and folded around the TMD as shown by the PRE analysis (Fig. 2 ). In addition, to evaluate the structural impact of weakening the interaction between CT and TMD, we introduced five mutations in the CT H1 including L748S, L755S, D758A, D759A, and S762A. The mutant (designated CT2-tmd, also used in the antigenicity studies below) appeared to have maintained the overall trimeric structure of the wild type in bicelles as the NMR resonances of the TMD and H2 did not change significantly (Fig. 3a) . The conformational stability of the mutant was examined by inter-chain PRE analysis, as was done in Supplementary Fig. 6b . Comparison of residuespecific PREs to that measured under identical condition for the TMD-CT LLP2 showed that the TMD PRE values of the mutant were reduced by as much as 30% (Fig. 3b ). Since the two samples carried the same spin-label at C764, the results indicate that the H1 mutations above indeed had weaken the CT-TMD interaction and probably loosened the CT baseplate. The above independent experiments collectively suggest that the specific TMD-CT interactions drive spontaneous formation of the CT ring around the TMD.",

In an earlier study, we showed that truncation or deletion of the CT diminishes Env binding to trimer-specific bnAbs that target the epitopes near the apex of the Env trimer 5, [28] [29] [30] . With the new CT structural information, we now probe this effect with CT mutations designed to disrupt CT-TMD or CT-CT interactions shown in Fig. 1 . The effect of the mutations on the antigenic structure of the Env ectodomain was evaluated by a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay 31 , using bnAbs VRC01 (CD4 binding site) 32 , PG9, PG16, and PGT145 (trimer-specific) 33, 34 , as well as non-neutralizing or strain-specific neutralizing antibodies, including b6 (CD4 binding site) 32 , 3791 (V3) 35 , and 17b (CD4-induced) 36 (mutant list and  results in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 , respectively; epitope mapping is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Although virus neutralization is not a direct measure of antibody binding to the Env as the process could be influenced by other factors such as possible CT-matrix protein (MA) interaction and membrane fusion kinetics, earlier studies have shown that loss of neutralization is overall correlated with the loss of Env binding to bnAbs 5,37 .

When expressed in 293T cells, these mutants produced comparable levels of Env, with similar extents of cleavage between gp120 and gp41 ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). In particular, none of these mutations in the CT region have led to dramatic increase in cellsurface levels ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). At a low Env expression level to mimic the low surface density on HIV-1 virions 38 , only the mutant TMD-ct showed a moderate reduction in cell-cell fusion activity, but still at~50% of that of the wild-type Env ( Supplementary Fig. 13a ). At a high Env expression level, the fusion activity of all the mutants was essentially indistinguishable from that of the wild type ( Supplementary Fig. 13b) , suggesting the high cell-surface density of Env can compensate for defects in membrane fusion caused by the CT mutations, as observed for mutations in the TMD and MPER previously 8, 9 . When these mutations were introduced into pseudoviruses, there were moderate changes in Env incorporation for mutants V749K and A756N, and in processing for those with large-scale mutations, including the mutant TMD-ct ( Supplementary Fig. 14) , consistent with the role of the CT in Env incorporation 39 . In addition, the mutant F774N showed substantially increased viral infectivity (165%) while the rest of mutants have impaired infectivity, ranging from 10 to 63% of that of the wild-type Env, suggesting that the CT can both positively and negatively modulate the efficiency of viral entry ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ).",

Among the four double mutants, the two containing D759R showed minor but noticeable reduction (~20%) in sensitivity to the trimer-specific bnAbs. The triple mutant (L702S-A756N-D759R) showed very significant resistance (~40%) to the trimer-specific bnAbs, especially for PG9 and PGT145 (Fig. 4b) . These results suggest the important role of D759 in interacting with either R709 or N706 of the TMD (Fig. 1b) , while underlining the nature of the CT structure being resistant to small changes. Larger scale mutagenesis of the CT-TMD interface resulted in mutants consistently less sensitive to the trimer-specific bnAbs, but remained totally resistant to the non-neutralizing antibodies ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 16 ). As a negative control, the mutant (A756N-L760S-L763N-C764E), containing mutations on the other side of the H1 helix, did not show any phenotype (Fig. 4d) . Finally, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity swapping of the key TMD residues in the CT-TMD interface generated a mutant (TMD-ct) that, while still sensitive to VRC01, was completely resistant to the trimer-specific bnAbs and also substantially sensitive to b6, 3791, and 17b (Fig. 4e) . These results suggest that disrupting the packing interface between the TMD and CT can destabilize the Env ectodomain and shift it to an open conformation 10, 40, 41 , further supporting our previous notion that the CT can modulate the antigenic structure of the Env trimer 5 .",

As expected, the TMD-ct mutant became much more sensitive to the HIV+ chronic sera than the wild type, consistent with an open Env conformation and the tier-1 phenotype 42 , while the two intermediate mutants were similar to the WT in the tier phenotype probably due to limited local changes near the trimer apex. We also tested additional bnAbs that target epitopes in CD4bs (binding site), V3-glycan, V1/V2-glycan, gp120/gp41 interface, and the MPER (Supplementary Table 4 ). While the wild-type and mutant viruses showed no major differences in sensitivity to most of these bnAbs, the mutants were~10-times more sensitive to the MPER-directed antibody 4E10 than the wild-type virus, suggesting that the mutations in the CT and/or TM regions significantly alter the MPER structure.",

The MPER-TMD shows significantly higher dynamics in the MPER and C-terminal region of the TMD than the hydrophobic core of the TMD (residues 686-689), suggesting that both ends are unconstrained (Fig. 5a) . We then locked the MPER by introducing the L660C and A667C mutations, which are positioned to form inter-chain disulfide in the MPER prefusion structure ( Supplementary  Fig. 17a ). Locking the MPER resulted in substantially reduced motion not only in the MPER, as expected, but also in the Cterminal region of the TMD at the opposite side of the membrane; no change in the TMD hydrophobic core (Fig. 5a) . Similar effects are observed in the TMD-CT LLP2 where the R 1 R 2 values for the TMD C-terminal region are less than that of the unlocked MPER-TMD (Fig. 5a) . These data suggest that the three TM helices undergo a \"scissor-like\" movement around the hydrophobic core (or the hinge), at which the trimer remains tightly associated as shown by H-D exchange analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 and ref. 26 ), and that constraining either N-or C-terminal end of the TM helix with locked MPER or CT, respectively, can affect the opposite end of the TMD. Therefore, disruption or deletion of the CT baseplate can in principle destabilize the MPER structure via the TMD (Fig. 5b ). Since the MPER is a control relay that modulates the ectodomain conformation and antigenic properties 9 , the CT-MPER coupling is also expected to shift conformational equilibria of the ectodomain and alter its antibody binding profile.",

The other two LLP segments (LLP3 and LLP1) of the CT can also form amphipathic helices 19 and we suggest that they may fold around the LLP2 ring to further expand the baseplate (Fig. 5b) . This model provides a structural explanation for our previous observations that progressive truncations of the CT incrementally reduced sensitivity of the Env ectodomain to PG16-like bnAbs, and that the effect reached maximum after the complete deletion of the LLP2 5 , as progressive truncations of the CT would gradually weaken the base support for the TMD. Indeed, our data on the co-refolding of the TMD-KS and CT LLP2 fragments show that the interaction between H1 and TMD is critical to the proper formation of the baseplate and possibly to the structural integrity of the entire Env. It is unclear whether the CT baseplate is relevant to viral entry. The new structural information further consolidates the notion that conformational state of the membrane-related components of the Env can influence the antigenic structure of the ectodomain.",

Our NMR dynamics study of the MPER-TMD and TMD-CT LLP2 fragments in bicelles provided compelling data suggesting physical coupling between the MPER and CT. The observation that locking the MPER with inter-chain disulfides reduced dynamics of the Cterminal end of the TMD~50 residues away suggests that the proposed cross-membrane coupling of the Env is entirely possible by structural consideration. It was somewhat surprising that TMD C-terminal end showed slightly more dynamics in the TMD-CT LLP2 than in the locked MPER-TMD, because we thought CT-TMD interaction may impose a more direct constraint on the TMD motion. Nevertheless, this result is not inconsistent with the proposed model in Fig. 5 . Comparing to the unlocked MPER-TMD, the TMD-CT LLP2 construct indeed showed reduced dynamics at the C-terminal end of the TMD, although the CT-TMD interaction still may not produce an effect as strong as covalently locking the MPER. The key message from the dynamics data is that the pivotal or the scissor-like motion of the TMD can be modulated by either MPER or CT.",

It is widely believed that the prefusion conformation of a functional HIV-1 Env on the surface of infectious virions is probably the most appropriate vaccine candidate for eliciting effective antibody responses, because it is recognized by most bnAbs and not by other tier-1 neutralizing antibodies 5, 48, 49 . Structural definition of the prefusion Env trimer at high resolution, which can provide a useful tool to facilitate immunogen selection and design, has limitations due to artificial modifications, extra ligands required for stability or the absence of membrane, compounded by observations with other spectroscopic approaches, such as single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy [50] [51] [52] . Our data presented here suggest new strategies to stabilize the native state of Env and help develop more effective Env trimer immunogens for clinical studies. ",

The His 6 -tagged proteins were expressed, purified and reconstituted in bicelles (q = 0.5) as previously described, except the sample buffer was a phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for better cross-linking efficiency.

Sequence specific assignment of TMD-CT LLP2 backbone chemical shifts (BMRB accession code 30678) was accomplished using a set of TROSY-enhanced triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CO, HNCO and HNCACB) 55, 56 , recorded on a ( 15 N, 13 C, 85% 2 H)-labeled sample. In addition, an ultra-high-resolution 3D 15 Nedited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC (\u03c4 mix = 180 ms) spectrum of a ( 15 N, 2 H)-labeled sample resulted extremely useful in completing the backbone resonance assignment. Protein aliphatic and aromatic resonances were assigned using a combination of 2D 13 C HSQC, 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC (\u03c4 mix = 80 ms), and 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC (\u03c4 mix = 150 ms). These NOESY experiments were performed on a ( 15 N, 13 C)-labeled sample reconstituted in bicelles with deuterated DMPC and DHPC acyl chains.",

Assigning inter-chain distance restraints, however, faced the challenge of measuring NOEs between structurally equivalent protomers having the same chemical shifts. To overcome this problem, we used a mixed sample in which half of the protomers were 15 N, 2 H-labeled and the other half 13 C-labeled. Recording a 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC (\u03c4 mix = 200 ms) on this sample allowed identification of NOEs exclusively between the 15 N-attached protons of one protomer and the aliphatic protons of the neighboring one. The identified NOEs were unambiguously confirmed by performing the 3D J CH -modulated NOE experiment 9,23 , in which two interleaved NOESY spectra were recorded with varying the J CH evolution (J CH = 0 ms and J CH = 8 ms) before the NOE mixing. Subtraction of the two spectra allowed selection of only the inter-chain NOEs. Finally, a control sample containing only ( 15 N, 2 H)labeled protein was used to perform an identical 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-TROSY-HSQC experiment as done for the mixed sample above (note: the 15 N, 2 H-labeled TMD-CT LLP2 in the mixed and control samples were from the same protein expression batch). Comparison of the mixed and control spectra provided another confirmation that the detected inter-chain NOEs were due to the mixing of protomers with different labeling schemes and not to residual protonation. This assignment strategy is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 4, where several examples of unambiguously assigned inter-chain NOEs are shown.",

Therefore, r Z can be assigned as residue-specific plane restraint if the PRE amp values are calibrated against a known structure with known membrane partition. Since the TMD-CT LLP2 and the TMD show remarkable chemical shift and structure similarity for residues 677-710 ( Supplementary Figs. 1c, 3a, and 8) , this region was used to calibrate the PRE amp values of the TMD-CT LLP2 (from both Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA) against the previously established structure and membrane partition of the TMD 8,26 (Supplementary Fig. 5e ). Specifically, we generated the PRE amp vs. r Z plot for residues 679-710 using the residue-specific PRE amp from the TMD-CT LLP2 and the known r Z from the known TMD structure. The data were then fitted to the sigmoidal function (Eq. (2)) to yield parameterized Eq. 2 for Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA, which were then used to determine r Z for the other residues of the TMD-CT LLP2 not used for the calibration (711-788). Out of the calculated r Z , only those in the sensitive region of the sigmoidal curves were retained. Finally, r Z derived from Gd-DOTA and 16-DSA data sets were averaged and merged into one single data set, yielding the final set of plane restraints. The plane restraints used for the TMD-CT LLP2 structure calculation included r Z from the published TMD structure (residues 679--710) and the newly calculated r Z for residues 711-788, with an uncertainty of \u00b11 \u00c5.",

To implement this strategy, we first performed TALOS+ 59 analysis using the assigned backbone chemical shift values ( 15 N, 13 C \u03b1 , 13 C \u03b2 , and 13 C\u02b9), and then used the \"GOOD\" dihedral angles generated by TALOS+ to build a secondary structural model of the TMD-CT LLP2 . Second, we assembled a trimer using the previously assigned NOE restraints for residues 677-702 (from PDB accession code 5JYN). Finally, we applied the newly assigned inter-chain restraints (most of them from residues 704-785) to complete the trimer of the TMD-CT LLP2 . For each inter-chain restraint between two adjacent protomers, three identical distance restraints were assigned respectively to all pairs of neighboring protomers to satisfy the condition of C 3 symmetry. The assembled trimer was then refined against the complete set of NOE restraints (intra-and inter-chain) and dihedral angles using a simulated annealing (SA) protocol in which the temperature was lowered from 1000 to 200 K in steps of 50 K. The NOE restraints were enforced by flat-well harmonic potentials, with the force constant ramped from 2 to 40 kcal/mol \u00c5 \u22122 during annealing. Backbone dihedral angle restraints were enforced by flat-well (\u00b1 the corresponding uncertainties from TALOS+) harmonic potential with force constant ramped from 10 to 1000 kcal/ mol rad \u22122 .

NOEs and backbone dihedral angle restraints for the MPER and TMD (residues 660-693 and 694-710, respectively) were taken from previously published studies 8, 9 , while those for the CT LLP2 (711-788) were taken from the current study. Plane restraints from the three regions were also applied. The model was refined using identical parameters and potentials as those used for the TMD-CT LLP2 (see above). A total of 150 structures were calculated, and the 15 lowest energy structures were selected as the final structural ensemble (PDB accession code 6UJV) ( Supplementary Fig. 19c and Supplementary Table 12 ).",

Error bars represent the uncertainty derived from R 1 and R 2 fitting errors.

For simplicity, only two chains of the trimer are illustrated. Left: the CT baseplate confines the TMD motion, important for stabilizing the Env trimer in the prefusion state. Right: deletion of the CT baseplate or disruption of CT-TMD interactions allows greater TMD hinge motion, destabilizing the MPER, which in turn modulates the antigenic structure of the ectodomain.
