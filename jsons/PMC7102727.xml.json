Travelers to developing countries can be exposed to various infectious agents and can facilitate their spread across borders. Two recent examples include the rapid worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza A (H1N1) [2], [3].",

An organized trip was defined as a guided, package trip, and these trips were primarily to popular tourist destinations. Outdoor activities included adventure sports, backpacking, hiking, and remote expedition.

A change in the demographic pattern of Greek travelers to developing countries was shown in the current survey relative to previous studies [26], which might reflect the influence of the economic crisis in Greece on immigration and international travel; there have been gradual increases in the proportion of travelers who are traveling to VFRs and business travelers and a decrease in the number of people traveling for recreation.

However, the vaccination rate for hepatitis A was lower than expected as indicated by retrospective analyses of travel and the travelers\u2019 characteristics. This finding might be attributable to the travelers\u2019 lack of knowledge about high-risk destinations [25] and possible pre-existing immunities [28]. The typhoid vaccine was delivered to less than 5% of the travelers; this rate was lower than those reported in other studies [8], [15]. Although those traveling to VFRs accounted for more than one-third of the travelers, and their main destination was the Indian subcontinent, only a few had received a typhoid fever vaccine. Retrospective analyses based on travel and the travelers\u2019 characteristics revealed that the rate of vaccination rate against typhoid fever was lower than expected (35%). The low rate of vaccination against rabies might be related to the travelers\u2019 and travel health providers\u2019 lack of knowledge about the risks of rabies exposure, as shown in a recent study from Greece, and to the time between consultation and departure [29], [30].",

Retrospective analyses of the data revealed that less than one-quarter of all travelers who visited malaria endemic areas, such as the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, received chemoprophylaxis. Only a few of those traveling to VFRs and approximately half of the business travelers who traveled to malaria endemic areas were prescribed chemoprophylaxis. The results of this survey suggest that the rate of malaria prophylaxis was below the expected rate, particularly among special groups, such as those traveling to VFRs and business travelers. These findings might be attributable to a lack of awareness about the risks of the disease among the travelers [26], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36].",
