            "text": "Bone defect healing is a process of reconstruction of the bone tissue, which generally undergoes a multidimensional procedure with an overlapping timeline [1]. The vast majority of bone defects can heal spontaneously under suitable physiological environmental conditions due to the regeneration ability of bone. However, the healing process of bone defect is time consuming, and new bone generation takes place slowly because of decreased blood supply to the fracture site and insufficiency of calcium and phosphorus to strengthen and harden new bone. In addition, large defects, also known as critical bone defects, may not heal spontaneously and lead to nonunion prognosis due to the size of defects or unstable biomechanical properties, unfavourable wound environment, suboptimal surgical technique, metabolic factors, hormones, nutrition, and applied stress [2], [3]. Bone grafts or substitute biomaterials are commonly used therapeutic strategies for clinical bone surgery to fill the bone defects for reconstructing large bone segments. Although autografts are the current gold standard treatment for bone defect regeneration [4], [5], it still has disadvantages such as limitation in donor supply [6], donor site pain, or haemorrhage [7]. Other disadvantages of allograft are the risk of immune-mediated rejection, the transmission of infectious diseases and the negative effect on the mechanical and biological properties of graft [8], [9], [10], [11]. In order to overcome the limitations associated with the current standard treatment of bone grafts, there has been an increasing interest in studying substitutes biomaterials, which are made of naturally derived and/or synthetic materials, during the past decades throughout the world [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. The ideal bone graft substitutes should be biocompatible, bioresorbable, osteoconductive, osteoinductive, structurally similar to nature bone, and easy or ready to use.",

In order to mimic various orthopaedic situations, many defect sites have been explored, such as calvaria [17], [18], [19], femora [20], [21], [22], and ulna [23], [24], [25]. A prerequisite for such a model is that no spontaneous complete osseous regeneration of the created defects occurs during the lifetime of the animals [49]. The critical size defect is defined as the smallest osseous wound that does not heal spontaneously over a long period of time. For practical purposes, if there is no mineralised area of \u226530% after 52 weeks, there would never be complete bony regeneration. Although the minimum size that renders a defect \u201ccritical\u201d is not well understood, it has been defined as a segmental bone deficiency of a length exceeding 2\u20132.5 times the diameter of the affected bone [11], [50].",

Besides, in comparison with other species, such as primates or some rodents, rabbit has faster skeletal change and bone turnover [56]. Rabbits are easily available, and easy to house and handle.

            "text": "In recent years, several rabbit models have been used to test new bone substitute biomaterials. The most common implantation sites include bilateral tibiae and distal femur (Table 1). Walsh et al [57] investigated three commercially available and clinically used \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) bone graft substitutes with the same chemistry (Vitoss, Osferion, Chronos), but with various macro- and microscopic characteristics, using a bilateral tibial metaphyseal defect model on New Zealand white rabbits. Bilateral defects (5 mm wide and 15 mm long) spanning the metaphyseal and diaphyseal regions were created 3 mm below the joint line in the anteromedial cortex of the proximal tibia. It turns out that all three \u03b2-TCP bone graft substitutes performed well in this rabbit model. Young et al [58] developed an easily accessible and reproducible, nonhealing, alveolar, 10 mm \u201cfull-thickness\u201d cylindrical defect removing both cortical plates and the intervening trabecular bone and tooth roots bone defect in the rabbit mandible. Gauthier et al [59] used a cylindrical, 7\u201310 mm critical-size bone defect rabbit model to investigate the efficiency of an injectable calcium phosphate bone substitute for bone regeneration. The critical-size bone defect rabbit model has been used successfully to carry out a histomorphometric analysis of a new, highly porous, biphasic calcium phosphate bone substitute by Calvo-Guirado et al [60]. Delgado-Ruiz et al [61] also used a critical-size tibiae defect rabbit model to test the behaviour of porous titanium granules, with and without membranes being covered. The test result showed that the porous titanium particles must be covered by a membrane, when grafting larger defects. Chen et al [62] established a critical-size bone defect model to test poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/TCP/icaritin 3D printing scaffold on the ulnar site.",

            "text": "Distal femur defect rabbit model has commonly been used to test substitute biomaterials by a variety of researchers [59], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68]. Although distal femur is not the commonly observed location of osteonecrosis in clinic, distal femur defects are frequently observed after the removal of malignant bone tumours [69] and total knee replacement [70], [71], [72]. Distal femur defects may lead to the failure of a total knee arthroplasty if left untreated [73]. Therefore, the use of a distal femur defect model is meaningful and constructive in testing substitute biomaterials prior to conducting human clinical trials. As the distal femoral defect rabbit model is one of the most commonly used animal models to test substitute biomaterials, here we review the surgical protocols for establishing steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) rabbit models with distal femoral defect for testing bone substitute materials. SAON, which would subsequently lead to subchondral joint collapse, is caused by the frequent prescription of pulsed steroids as a life-saving agent in a situation such as severe acute respiratory syndromes. Core decompression is the major treatment method for SAON in the early stage. However, the nonunion bone defect that remained after the surgery may lead to insufficient mechanical support of the femur and result in joint collapse, seriously affecting the prognosis. Therefore, the use of suitable bone substitute materials to fill in the defect and provide a mechanical support to the femur is essential for the process of SAON bone defect repair. In order to test the substitute materials' biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and availability, a model of SAON is necessary.",

First of all, rabbits should be in healthy condition, weigh 3.0\u20133.5 kg, and reach an age of 28 weeks, which is similar to the adult age of human beings. Then, one injection of 10 mg/kg of lipopolysaccharide was given intravenously to the dopey rabbits. A day after that, three injections of 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone were given intramuscularly at time intervals of 24 hours. Two weeks later, 93% of the rabbits developed osteonecrosis and none of them died during the procedure. This procedure is considered to be more effective or efficient, with a lower death rate compared with other published methods [76]. When the SAON rabbit model was established, we performed core decompression in rabbits by drilling a 3.0 mm tunnel transversely through the distal femora (Figure 1). Using this model, we have tested the in vivo bone defect repairing ability of a new bioactive PLGA/TCP composite scaffold incorporating the phytomolecule icaritin [75].",

However, pigs have a denser trabecular network, which considered intricate, difficult to handle, noisy, and aggressive; hence, pigs are often neglected in favour of more amenable species such as sheep and goats [95], [96], [97]. Furthermore, the length of the tibiae and femora in pigs is relatively small, which cannot meet the special implant needs of humans. Pig was the animal of choice for critical-size defect models to test bone substitute biomaterials because its bone regeneration rate (1.2\u20131.5 \u03bcm/d) is comparable to that of humans (1.0\u20131.5 \u03bcm/d) [49].

A commonly used protocol for developing a porcine craniofacial bone defect model and testing substitute materials was reported by Wehrhan et al [45]. Briefly, after anaesthetising domestic pigs and exposing the skull, nine defects of 10 mm diameter and 10 mm depth were created on it. Three testing groups, i.e., HA/TCP covered by poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) membrane, HA/TCP mixed with PEG matrix, and HA/TCP mixed with BMP-2 transfected hFOB cells and PEG matrix, were filled in three out of nine defects. The remaining six defects were filled with HA/TCP. After 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and the os frontale was harvested for the following histological and immunohistochemical analyses.",

Sheep bones have similar macrostructure to human bones, but histologically, the bone structure of sheep is different from that of humans. In sheep, bone consists predominantly of the primary bone structure [100] in comparison with the largely secondary bone structure of humans [101]. Secondary bone remodelling in sheep does not take place until an average age of 7\u20139 years [96], while at 3\u20134 years of age they have a plexiform bone structure comprising a combination of woven and lamellar bones within which vascular plexuses are sandwiched [51]. Mature sheep have a significantly higher trabecular bone density and subsequently greater bone strength when compared to humans [51], [102]. However, differences may change with location. Some researchers argue that sheep are still valuable models for human bone turnover and remodelling activity, although differences in bone structure were defined [103], [104], [105]. Sheep are shown to have a larger amount of bone ingrowth than humans; this is probably due to the greater amount of cancellous bone in the distal femur of sheep compared with humans [106].",

The defect was created in a 4\u20135-year-old sheep model and stabilized with a unilateral external fixator. The implant to the defects was divided into four groups. Assessment of in vivo stiffness was performed every week in a 4-week period by a custom-made device [107]. The radiology result revealed that only the bone graft group showed obvious recovery.

After reviewing >100 publications about in vivo tests of biomaterials, we conclude that most authors fail to discuss the reason for choosing the animal model that they established and the clinical indication that they are stimulating. Although no animal model is perfect to simulate clinical conditions, we recommend that animal models should be established based on clinical indications. Finally, anaesthesia practice and specific surgical protocol should be included in the publications so as to make sure that animal welfare is well established.",
