Biomicroscopy provides a magnified view of the living eye using a light that can be varied in intensity, width, height, and color. In general for laboratory animals, this is performed using a handheld slit lamp of the ophthalmologist\u2019s preference. The slit lamp used for routine examination should be portable, lightweight, and easy to use on a variety of species. The two most common portable slit lamps used for laboratory animals are the Zeiss HSO-10 (Fig. 1) and the Kowa SL-14/15 (Fig. 2). The Zeiss HSO-10 provides a 12\u00d7 magnification with a 125 mm working distance and is both lightweight and easy to use on all species. The Kowa SL-14/15 has either a 10\u00d7 or a 16\u00d7 magnification with a 100 mm working distance. Unlike the Zeiss, the Kowa works from a battery pack and is re-charged in a stand. Both have fixed slit widths (0.15 and 0.75 mm Zeiss; 0.1, 0.2, and 0.8 mm Kowa) and both have a cobalt blue filter for fluorescein. If higher magnification or photographic documentation are required, a table-mounted slit lamp may be used (Fig. 3). Table slit lamps provide higher quality optics, increased magnification, and variable width and height of the slit beam and with additional attachments can allow for photographic documentation, gonioscopy, or specular microscopy. Table slit lamps are however significantly more expensive, less portable, and more difficult to use on a large number of animals or un-sedated animals.\n\n\n",

            "text": "The slit lamp performs two major functions. First, it provides magnification for a more detailed examination of the eye. Secondly it makes use of the slit beam, decreasing the beam of light to a slit allowing an optical cross section of the eye to be obtained (Figs. 4 and 5). This allows precise localization of the depth of a lesion and allows visualization of subtle changes that cannot be seen with full illumination (Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The term for this type of illumination and examination is an optical section and it is the most common method of biomicroscopic examination. Using a narrow slit beam, a highly magnified optical section of the eye is obtained. The direction of the slit beam may be varied so that the structures may be viewed using either direct illumination or retroillumination [1]. This will allow the examiner to detect and localize, with respect to depth, abnormalities in the anterior segment of the eye. For example, a corneal lesion can be localized to superficial, stromal, or endothelial; aqueous opacities such as cells (aqueous, vitreous), flare, or hemorrhage are detectable and quantifiable; and lesions of the lens may be localized to anterior, posterior, equatorial, and further to capsular, cortical, or nuclear. Interpretation of the findings on slit lamp biomicroscopy requires extensive knowledge of normal findings as well as background lesions that occur as incidental findings in the species and breed being examined [1].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "Indirect ophthalmoscopy is the preferred technique of choice for routine screening of the posterior segment in all laboratory animal species. Indirect ophthalmoscopy provides a binocular, inverted, and reversed aerial image with a wide field of view. It requires an indirect headset and a condensing lens. Once perfected, the technique of indirect examination also allows for a more rapid examination of the entire posterior segment as it provides a wider panoramic field of view, allowing the examiner to evaluate more animals, more accurately in a shorter period of time. The indirect headset of choice should be lightweight, comfortable, and easy to manipulate out of the way with one hand and have a small pupil setting. The ease of manipulation will allow the examiner to move efficiently between indirect and biomicroscopic examination techniques. While several excellent choices are available, the Keeler All Pupil\u00ae is best suited in the author\u2019s opinion (Fig. 11). Alternatively, the Heine indirect ophthalmoscope also offers excellent optics and can be fitted with a portable power supply, but is slightly heavier and more cumbersome for large number of animals (Fig. 12). The indirect condensing lens of choice varies by species examined and by the examiner\u2019s choice. In general, a 2.2 Pan Retinal or 30 diopter lens works well for routine screening examination of most larger species and a 40 or a 60 diopter works best for rats and mice. The addition of a 20 diopter and/or a 15 diopter lens may be advised for higher magnification of the fundus in the canine and to examine the fovea and optic nerve in greater detail in NHPs. Alternately, a direct ophthalmoscope (Fig. 13) can be used to examine the optic nerve head and fovea in NHPs, but given its small field and monocular view, it is less than optimal in the author\u2019s opinion. In addition, when performing direct ophthalmoscopy any opacity of the cornea, aqueous, lens, or vitreous will severely impair or prevent visualization of the posterior segment.\n\n\n",

When examining using indirect ophthalmoscopy, the examiner remains at arm\u2019s length and places the condensing lens just anterior to the cornea. This technique is used to examine the posterior vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vasculature, retina, and choroid. In addition, opacities of the clear media (cornea, aqueous, lens, and vitreous) are readily detectable using retroillumination. This technique can be used to grade vitreous inflammation/opacification (Table 6). Given the wide variety of laboratory animals, the examiner must be familiar with the variation of normal anatomy and species variations. The retinal vasculature will vary with the species anangiotic (guinea pig), merangiotic (rabbit), and holangiotic (rodent, canine, swine, primate). The pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the choroid vary between albinotic, sub-albinotic, and pigmented animals of the same species (mouse, rat, rabbit). Some species such as the canine will have a tapetum located in the superior choroid, but this can be lacking in color dilute or lemon beagles. Finally, NHPs are foveated and this region must be examined carefully for abnormalities.",

However, some abnormalities are so common as to preclude elimination. The most common example of this would be corneal dystrophy in the rat and mouse [23, 29\u201338]. The prevalence of corneal dystrophy varies by stain, age, and sex of the rat. In the Sprague\u2013Dawley, males are more commonly affected than females and prevalence will increase with age and may vary from 20 to 50 % (Fig. 17). In the Wistar, corneal dystrophy has been reported to affect >65 % (Fig. 18) and in the Fisher 344 (Fig. 19), the prevalence is generally 100 %. As a result of such a high prevalence, affected animals cannot be eliminated from inclusion in study. However, animals affected with corneal dystrophy with a severity grade of greater than slight or with secondary keratitis should be eliminated at pretest. Corneal dystrophy lesions are also observed in other species including the beagle (Fig. 20) and Dutch Belted rabbit (Fig. 21). It should also be noted that lesions such as corneal dystrophy can be exacerbated in both prevalence and severity by corneal exposure caused by desiccation, sedation/anesthesia, orbital bleeding, environmental irritants, and the test article itself.\n\n\n\n\n",

The breed-related abnormalities will vary according to the supplier and are often seen with a prevalence that waxes and wanes according to the current sires and dams. For example in the author\u2019s experience, micropapilla is more common in a specific supplier\u2019s beagles, but rare in beagles from other suppliers. Keep in mind that these are tightly controlled breeding programs to yield a beagle with specific characteristics and their ocular lesions while similar in kind may differ in prevalence from the pet beagles seen in a clinical setting. In the author\u2019s experience, prolapse of the gland of the nictitans (Fig. 30), retinal dysplasia (folds) (Figs. 31 and 32), optic nerve micropapilla/hypoplasia (Fig. 33), and incipient posterior cortical or anterior suture cataract (Figs. 6, 34, and 35) are the most common breed-related findings in the laboratory beagle [17, 18, 21, 40]. These are similar to the previously reported prevalence of ophthalmic findings in 8\u201310-month-old beagles (Table 7) [17]. Corneal dystrophy is also observed in the laboratory beagle [19, 20]. It should be noted that corneal dystrophy, cataracts, and retinal degeneration may also be noted as a treatment-related finding (Figs. 36, 37, and 38).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The tapetum is cellular in nature and is located between the large choroidal vessels and the choriocapillaris in the dorsal aspect of the fundus. The tapetal color is variable with blue, green, orange, and yellow the most common variations. There are also atapetal beagles, usually color dilute, which are reported to have tapetal cells that are deficient in tapetal rodlets [41]. The tapetum can have a role in ocular toxicity [42] and in such instances atapetal beagles can be used. The tapetum of the dog contains a high concentration of zinc and as such zinc chelators may result in tapetal necrosis and secondary retinopathy [43]. Additional drug-associated lens and retinal changes have also been described in the beagle (Figs. 37 and 38) [44, 45].",

Corneal dystrophy appears more prevalent in males than females and increases in prevalence with age [23, 35, 36, 46]. In the Sprague\u2013Dawley, the lesions of corneal dystrophy involve the axial cornea and appear as fine granules or crystals in the subepithelial stroma (Fig. 17). A basement membrane dystrophy and calcium deposits are noted histologically and ultrastructurally (Fig. 42). The severity is generally mild, keratitis is uncommon, and prevalence increases with age. Rats as young as a few weeks of age can be affected.",

It should be noted that papers citing prevalence below this often fail to examine using biomicroscopy [33, 34]. When compared to the Sprague\u2013Dawley the lesions in the Fischer 344 are more numerous and larger and may have a linear pattern in the axial cornea. As the Fischer 344 rat ages, the corneal dystrophy severity score is expected to increase and keratitis, corneal vascularization, and corneal ulceration may occur in association with corneal dystrophy. In addition to corneal dystrophy, in one report affected rats were also found to have basement membrane changes in other organs [34]. Corneal changes are characterized histologically by thickened, fragmented, and mineralized corneal basement membranes. These lesions have also been described to be associated with limbal inflammatory reaction which may be the precursor to the keratitis and vascularization. It should be noted that as corneal dystrophy in the Fisher 344 worsens clinically the opacities increase in size and density. The overlying epithelium will become elevated, as the dystrophy becomes a space-occupying lesion. Histologically, the epithelium overlying a severe area of dystrophy will be thin and possibly keratinizing indicating irritation. It is this space-occupying, foreign-body effect combined with the disruption of the corneal epithelial basement membrane that results in corneal vascularization and keratitis. It has been the author\u2019s experience that in some instances dystrophy will even result in the loss of the overlying corneal epithelium exposing the underlying basement membrane and possibly the corneal stroma. Severity may be more severe in males.",

In corneal dystrophy of the Dutch Belted rabbit there is a thickening of the corneal basement membrane and a thinning and disorganization of the overlying corneal epithelium [25]. In the Watanabe rabbit, altered lipid metabolism may be associated with corneal lipidosis especially when fed a high-fat diet (Fig. 55) [43, 73]. Inherited glaucoma and associated buphthalmia are seen in the NZW rabbit and occur as the result of goniodysgenesis with the mode of inheritance being autosomal recessive (bu/bu gene) [74\u201376]. IOP increases beginning at 1\u20133 months of age with resulting buphthalmia [77].\n\n\n\n",

The probe must be fired at the cornea in the horizontal position, parallel to the floor to be accurate. The most common rebound tonometer for laboratory animals is the Tonovet\u00ae (Fig. 57). Unfortunately the Tonovet\u00ae is most specifically calibrated for the dog and horse, but it has been used reliably in other species [95\u201397, 99\u2013103]. It has the advantage of not requiring topical anesthesia and seems to obtain the IOP more easily than the Tonpen\u00ae in many laboratory animals including the dog, rabbit, and rat. Its disadvantage is that it cannot be self-calibrated prior to use. Like the Tonopen\u00ae the Tonovet\u00ae also averages six readings and gives an indication of % error using a bar at the left of the IOP value. There should be no error bar or the bar should be at the left ventral aspect of the screen for a reading to be acceptable.\n",

It is used to evaluate for corneal epithelial defects and can also be used in evaluation of the pre-corneal tear film. Fluorescein is available in individual impregnated strips that are moistened at the time of use using sterile saline. The moistened strip is gently applied to the dorsal sclera taking care not to contact the cornea. The excess fluorescein is then gently irrigated from the eye using a gravity-fed stream of saline rather than a forced high-velocity stream. The eye is then examined by the ophthalmologist using a biomicroscope and the cobalt blue filter to excite the fluorescein should any remain following irrigation.",

The standard ERG is a full-field stimulation that provides information about the retina as a whole and is a mass response of the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, and inner retinal layer [87]. For localized retinal evaluation the multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and for evaluation of macular ganglion cells the pattern reversal electroretinogram (PERG) are indicated [87]. To evaluate the entire visual pathway from the retina to the visual cortex, a VEP is the technique of choice [87]. Of these tests, the full-field ERG is most common for preclinical toxicologic testing.

The optic disc can be measured with respect to the cup area, disc area, cup diameter, disc diameter, and rim area [121]. Evaluation of the anterior segment by OCT provides structural information of the cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and iridocorneal angle without the need for corneal contact as is required for ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) [121]. It also provides greater axial resolution than that provided by UBM [121].

Normal corneal endothelial cells are regular in arrangement and hexagonal in shape. Cells are evaluated for cell density, pleomorphism, and polymegethism. As cell counts vary by age of the animal and region of the cornea these variables must be standardized using animals of the same age and examining the axial cornea. Animals must be sedated or anesthetized to obtain an accurate image and automated systems are available that simplify the technique.

It allows in vivo, noninvasive, real-time images of the eye at magnifications (630\u00d7) which allow resolution of anatomical detail at the cellular level [139]. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy of the eye has also been described [141, 142]. Confocal microscopy has been used to image the cornea of various laboratory species including rabbits, rats, and mice [143]. Its use has also been described in dogs, cat, birds, guinea pigs, and horses [144\u2013148]. Confocal microscopy can provide detailed imaging of the corneal architecture at the cellular level of each corneal epithelial cell layer, the epithelial basement membrane, corneal stroma including nerve fibers and keratocytes, Descemet\u2019s membrane, and endothelium [86]. While confocal microscopy is most commonly used in the clinical arena [149\u2013153], its use may be indicated to evaluate the cornea and corneal thickness in contact lens studies, to evaluate the stromal keratocytes or corneal endothelium for toxicity, or to monitor wound healing [86, 144].",
