            "text": "Catechol derivatives show different biological properties, including inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase-2 (HPH) in the treatment of colitis,1 antiepileptogenic,2 pulmonary fibrosis,3 anticancer,4, 5, 6 antimicrobial,7 and anti-Parkinson activities.8 Moreover, they are active against viruses, as in the case of rhinovirus,9 HIV-1 integrase,10, 11 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase,12 and coronavirus.13 The biological activity of catechols is associated to their antioxidant property, that is the capacity of transferring single-electron and/or hydrogen-atom to reactive free radicals,14, 15, 16 as well as, to binding pro-oxidant metal ions.17 The antioxidant activity can be oriented toward specific cellular compartments by controlling the chemical and physical properties of the substituents on the aromatic ring.18 For example, the limited accessibility of highly hydrophilic catechols to specific intracellular targets has been improved by the synthesis of lipophilic derivatives possessing long carbon alkyl side chains.19, 20, 21 In the case of bioactive hydroxytyrosol and dihydrocaffeic acid derivatives,22, 23 which are characterized by the concomitant presence of alcoholic and ortho-diphenol groups,24, 25 the side-chain functionalization requires expensive and tedious protection/deprotection sequences. As an alternative, we described the synthesis of lipophilic catechols by selective oxidation of side-chain functionalized phenol derivatives, using tyrosinase supported on Eupergit C250L resin (Tyr/ECM), by sequential deposition of alternatively charged poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS).26 Tyrosinase is a copper enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of monophenols to ortho-diphenols and ortho-quinones using dioxygen (O2) as primary oxidant.27 In this latter case, dihydrocaffeoyl catechols showed antiviral activity against Influenza A virus, an infection that continue to represent a severe threat wordwide.28 Derivatives characterized by antioxidant activity and longer carbon alkyl side-chains were more effective, suggesting the possibility of novel inhibition mechanisms based on both redox and lipophilic properties.26 These data were in accordance with previous findings about the activity of lipophilic glutathione (GSH) derivatives, which were able to enter into the cell more easily than GSH, thus inhibiting the replication of DNA and RNA viruses.29 The efficacy of tyrosinase in the synthesis of simple catechol derivatives was successively increased by immobilization of the enzyme on multi-walled carbonanotubes (MWCNTs), using the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) procedure.30 The LbL procedure is based on the consecutive deposition of alternatively charged polyelectrolytes onto the active species, able to protect proteins from high-molecular-weight denaturing agents.31 MWCNTs are characterized by high surface area for enzyme loading, as well as biocompatibility, and favorable electrochemical and mechanical properties.32, 33 The best catalyst (indicated in the follow as MWCNT/Tyr) was obtained by co-immobilization of Tyr and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) on oxidized MWCNTs, in the presence of polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (PDDA).30 Here we report the use of MWCNT/Tyr for the improved synthesis of lipophilic hydroxytyrosol and dihydrocaffeoyl catechols, and their antiviral activity against a large panel of DNA and RNA viruses, including Poliovirus type 1, Echovirus type 9, Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), Coxsackie virus type B3 (Cox B3), Adenovirus type 2 and type 5, and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Some of these compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at sub-toxic concentrations. The mechanism of action of the most active dihydrocaffeoyl derivative was investigated in detail against a model of HSV-1 infection.",

The excess PDDA was removed by centrifugation/re-dispersion cycles since residual PDDA in the solution can precipitate upon mixing with enzyme. The concentration of adsorbed PDDA was evaluated by UV\u2013vis analysis (at 595 nm) of the supernatant after treatment with Comassie Brillant Blue (CBB) (experimental details and the calibration curve for PDDA are in Supplementary information, SI # 1, Table A, Fig. 1).35 The amount of PDDA adsorbed per mg of starting material was found to be 0.58 \u00b1 0.01 mg. This amount is similar to the \u2018just enough\u2019 amount of PDDA (0.48 mg) required to cover all the surface of MWCNTs (100% covering efficacy), as previously reported.36\n",

The maximum height and width were higher than that observed for MWCNTs alone (experimental procedures, SEM analysis, and magnified details of the bi-dimensional high resolution AFM images of MWCNT/Ty and MWCNTs with the corresponding profiles, are in Supplementary information SI #3, Figs. 4 and 5).30\n",

For this reason, natural or de-novo designed molecules able to inhibit the replication of DNA or RNA viruses with different mechanisms have been synthesized.47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 The antiviral activity of lipophilic catechol derivatives 3, 3a\u2013d, and 4a\u2013d was evaluated against several DNA and RNA viruses (Polio 1, Echo 9, HSV-1, HSV-2, Cox B3, Adeno 2, Adeno 5 and CMV). Cell monolayers were infected at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.1 and treated with different concentrations (ranging from 25 to 200 \u03bcg/mL) of each compound. The values of CD50 (concentration which inhibited cells growth by 50% when compared with control culture) and ID50 (concentration which inhibited virus plaque formation and virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50%) of catechol derivatives are shown in Table 4, Table 5\n, respectively.",

In particular, compounds 3b and 4a demonstrated the highest level of activity against HSV-1 (DNA virus), with ID50 values of 15 and 20 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the same compounds showed slight activity against HSV-2 (60 and 40 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) and Cox B3 (RNA virus; 20 and 50 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). With regard to 4b, a modest activity against HSV-1 was observed, probably due to toxic effect on cell monolayer, as suggested by the low value of CD50 (40 \u03bcg/mL). Finally, 3b and 3d were effective against CMV (DNA virus), 3d being the most active compound with an ID50 value of 25 \u03bcg/mL. Since 3b was effective against several RNA or DNA viruses, especially in the case of herpetic viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2 and CMV), its mechanism of action was investigated in more detail using a model of HSV-1 infection. In particular, compound 3b was added at different times on VERO cells infected with 0.1 MOI of HSV-1, to determine the inhibition of the virus yield during specific periods in the virus life-cycle. The results clearly demonstrate that 3b interferes with an early step of the viral replicative cycle. Indeed, the viral replication was blocked during the first hour of infection. Otherwise, no reduction was observed when 3b was added after 2 h. Moreover, a slight reduction of virus yield was observed during the adsorption period (Fig. 2\n).",

First, the effect of the compound was studied during the viral adsorption period by means of the infective center assay. Results obtained from this experiment demonstrated that 3b did not significantly inhibit adsorption of HSV-1 at concentrations higher than 5 times the ID50 (Fig. 3\n). Furthermore, it was important to establish if any virucidal effect or protective actions for Vero cells was produced. Our results demonstrated that 3b was not virucidal for HSV-1 and did not exerted any protective action for the cells, thus suggesting that the reduction in the virus yield, immediately after the adsorption period, could be related to the interference of the compound with penetration, un-coating and/or another early step of HSV-1 replication.",
