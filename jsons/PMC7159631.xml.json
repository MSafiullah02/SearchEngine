The contemporary view of the RAS has evolved from that of a simple linear pathway involving the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin II (Ang II) via a two\u2010step process facilitated by renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), to a much more complex system involving homologues of ACE and multiple angiotensin peptides which play supplementary and counter\u2010regulatory roles (Figure 1). The RAS was, for many years, thought of as an endocrine system with enzymes and peptides released into the systemic circulation to act on target organs. More recently, it has been recognised that most organs including the brain, kidney, heart, liver, pancreas, reproductive organs, skin and the gastrointestinal tract constitutively express all the components required to allow autonomous function of a local intra\u2010organ RAS, where it performs both paracrine and autocrine functions.",

Some of the regional effects of the RAS are listed below:\nIn the kidney, local angiotensinogen is converted by renin to Ang I, which in turn is cleaved by tubular brush border ACE to Ang II to facilitate sodium and fluid absorption via luminal AT1R. This may influence blood pressure independent of systemic Ang II levels and vascular tone.29, 30\nThe heart expresses renin, PRR, ACE, chymase, angiotensinogen, AT1R and AT2R, and these components modulate myocyte proliferation and cardiac remodelling.6, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37\nThe brain has been shown to express renin, angiotensinogen, Ang II, Ang III, Ang IV, Ang (1\u20107), AT1R, AT2R and AT4R, with these components regulating blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance, thirst, maintenance of the blood\u2010brain barrier and neuronal development including learning and memory processes.38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44\nThe liver expresses renin, angiotensinogen, Ang II, ACE, AT1R, Ang (1\u20107), ACE2 and mas receptors, all of which are upregulated in the diseased liver.45, 46 Furthermore, ARBs and Ang (1\u20107) have been demonstrated to reduce liver fibrosis in animal models.47, 48, 49\nIn the pancreas, Ang II has been shown to inhibit glucose stimulated insulin secretion, and via AT1R and AT2R, regulates exocrine enzyme secretion and the microcirculation.50, 51, 52\nA local RAS has been identified and shown to be involved in tissue homeostasis in the reproductive organs, skin and even adipose tissue.53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 Detailed reviews of these and other local RAS effects are published elsewhere.12, 30, 50, 54, 59, 60, 61\n\n",

A larger study involving 124 UC patients and 108 CD patients also found no difference in ACE gene polymorphisms when compared with normal controls, but a subgroup analysis revealed a higher proportion of DD genotype in 25 UC patients with extra\u2010intestinal manifestations, with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.08.109 Indeed, it is difficult to reconcile these findings into a unifying hypothesis regarding the role of ACE in IBD pathogenesis. It is possible that inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101 downregulate systemic endothelial ACE production,110 whereas Ang II produced via local intestinal ACE contributes to tissue inflammation.

This genotype results in increased production of angiotensinogen via a substitution in its gene promoter.111 Indeed, mucosal levels of Ang I and Ang II are elevated in rectosigmoid biopsies in patients with Crohn's colitis compared with patients with UC or normal controls,93 and a significant correlation was noted between these levels and endoscopic grade of colitis. Although these findings demonstrate that components of the local tissue RAS probably play a part in inflammation, they do not prove any causal link in the pathogenesis of IBD.
