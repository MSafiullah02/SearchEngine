For example, based on the Annual Budget Law, more than R$ 5 billion will be dedicated to combating the outbreak of COVID-19. Intensified surveillance, resources, and viral identification assays should be urgently prioritized to detect COVID-19 cases and to limit transmission. A combination of these measures may help to increase reporting of these cases, thus slowing down the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

According to the Ministry of Health, the number of probable dengue cases increased by almost 19%, from 79,131 between December 29 and February 01 in 2019 to 94,149 in the same period in 2020. In 2019, about 2.3 million dengue cases were registered nationwide. Even in south regions of the country where the outbreak of dengue fever had never occurred, the number of dengue cases has been increasing at an alarming rate, with several deaths being recorded [2] . The number of dengue cases is often observed to increase at the beginning of the year due to the rainy season and high temperatures and peak between March and April.",

In the midst of this complex epidemiological scenario, the fragile healthcare system in Brazil is facing the risk of collapse and multiple socio-economic issues [5] . For example, Constitutional Amendment 95 established the public spending limits, and in 2019, the health budget reduced by R$ 9 billion. There may not be enough intensive care units to accommodate even 25% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The lack of specific diagnostic tests, especially the real-time RT-PCR, would also make it challenging to perform early detection of virus importation and prevent onward transmission [5] .
