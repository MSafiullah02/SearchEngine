In particular, wheezing was considered to be severe in the presence of tachypnoea (\u226560 breaths/min), tachycardia (\u2265180 beats/min), nasal flaring, retractions, a prolonged expiratory phase, pulse oximetry <92%, and dehydration (a reduction in body weight of >7%). All of the patients underwent chest radiography, and pneumonia was defined on the basis of the presence of a reticulo\u2010nodular infiltrate, segmental or lobar consolidation, or bilateral consolidations [29]. Upon enrolment, Virocult (Medical Wire and Equipment, Corsham, UK) nasopharyngeal swabs were used to collect specimens for the detection of viruses, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained for the detection of atypical bacteria.

More than 60% of the infants in our study sample were infected with RSV, whereas the prevalence of the other pathogens never exceeded 6%. The absolute relevance of RSV was particularly evident among the 23 infants aged 3\u201312 months infected with a single pathogen, 22 of whom (95.7%) had RSV infection. However, even in the first 3 months of life, an association between wheezing and respiratory infections due to pathogens other than RSV was uncommon, occurring in only eight (21.1%) of the 38 children in whom a single pathogen was detected. The importance of RSV in the infants\u2019 first wheezing episode was also clear in the co\u2010infected cases, because 11 of the 15 cases in whom more than one pathogen was detected (73.3%) had RSV infection.",

It is therefore possible that, if the study had extended over a longer period, the proportions of wheezing episodes associated with the different infectious pathogens may have been slightly different. However, as most cases of wheezing in the first year of life occur during late autumn and winter [1, 2, 3, 4], it is unlikely that these differences would significantly change the outcome of the current study.",

In addition, most of the papers do not specify whether the studied wheezing episode was the first, and, in some cases, the disease for which each child was admitted is not precisely defined. However, the results of the few studies comparing different infectious agents (but not atypical bacteria) and their association with wheezing in early life have also highlighted the primary role of RSV [9, 11, 14, 15].",

Although only a small number of children in the current study had infections due to a pathogen other than RSV, all of the data regarding the onset and severity of the disease, drug administration and duration of hospitalization are similar regardless of aetiology. These findings suggest that all of the respiratory pathogens can cause wheezing, and that all of them lead to a similar clinical presentation in hospitalized infants. However, this does not mean that the clinical impact of the studied pathogens was similar, because it is possible that respiratory pathogens other than RSV may cause more frequent, although less severe, wheezing in children not requiring hospitalization.",

The finding that RSV remains the most important pathogen associated with the first episode of wheezing during the first year of life, and that only subjects infected with this virus are at risk of developing long\u2010term airway hyper\u2010responsiveness, confirm the data suggesting that RSV induces age\u2010related changes in lung function [5, 25, 26, 27]. Mouse studies have shown that the probability of a chronic alteration in lung function is greater the earlier the first RSV infection occurs, as is the probability that a subsequent infection will be followed by severe wheezing [25, 47]. Earlier infection seems to induce a polarized Th2 response which, in the case of re\u2010infection, causes exacerbated disease, as indicated by enhanced pulmonary resistance, mucus hyperproduction, eosinophilia, and high Th2 cytokine levels [48, 49, 50]. Our data suggest that, in humans, the period during which RSV infection can lead to a greater risk of further wheezing episodes extends at least until the end of the first year of life. The proportion of children in the current study infected by RSV who experienced a new episode of wheezing in the 6 months following the first episode was virtually the same in both age groups, whereas none of the children whose first wheezing episode was associated with an infectious agent other than RSV experienced a further episode.",

A relationship between RSV genotypes and clinical data has not been completely established [51, 52, 53], and RSV viral load appears to correlate with disease severity in some studies [54, 55] but not in others [51].",
