            "text": "Background: Many treatments are being assessed for repurposing to treat coronavirus disease 2019 . One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (C max ), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (eC 50 ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) (C max : eC 50 roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COviD-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. we aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. Methods: A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using eMBASe and MeDLiNe databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. we searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5-14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1-4 and serious adverse events (Aes). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (Gi) Aes, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. Results: Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the Ae endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active-or placebo-controlled trials. Mild Gi Aes increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited.",

Nitazoxanide was therefore selected as a good candidate for potentially inhibiting SARS-Cov-2. To assess inhibition potential, researchers compared the maximum serum concentration of tizoxanide (C max ) with the in vitro eC 50 for nitazoxanide for SARS-Cov-2. BD with food [6] . Pharmacokinetics were not influenced by repeat dosing at 500 mg BD (C max 10,400 ng/mL after single dose compared with 12,200 ng/mL on day 7) but increased considerably after repeat dosing at 1000 mg BD (C max 16,800 ng/mL after single dose vs 26,400 ng/mL on day 7) [6] . All reported C max values for tizoxanide exceeded the reported in vitro eC 50 of nitazoxanide for SARS-Cov-2 [651 ng/mL (2.12 \u03bcM)] [7] . Nitazoxanide concentration has also been specifically predicted to exceed its eC 50 for SARS-Cov-2 by 3.1-fold in the lung [8] . it should be noted that this eC 50 value was reported for nitazoxanide rather than its human metabolite, tizoxanide, but previous studies have shown similar activity to nitazoxanide when tested against various strains of influenza [9] .",
