In particular, hosting mega- and hallmark events is perceived as an important vehicle for tourism development because it facilitates an increase in tourist numbers, the generation of a positive destination image, and the development of areas (Fourie & Santana-Gallego, 2011; Getz, 2008). According to Teigland (1999), the tourism demand pattern of special events follows two forms: a \u201cnew plateau\u201d scenario and a \u201cback to normal\u201d alternative. The former represents increased tourist volume after the hosting of mega-events because of increased awareness of the destination, improved attractions and infrastructure, and an extensive transportation system established during the hosting, from which the destination builds up its competitiveness among other tourist destinations. The \u201cback to normal\u201d scenario, on the other hand, implies that a big tourism boom is realized during the event period; however, the demand related to tourism services and goods reverts to pre-event levels after the occasion is completed. A bell-shaped curve of the tourist flow over time is thus observed. The main factor that determines the reduction of tourist demand is a decreased destination awareness among potential tourists when media attention switches to other upcoming events.",

This research line can be divided into two categories. The first research direction emphasizes the economic impact analysis associated with the expenditure of participants using empirical numbers to demonstrate the contribution of sales, personal income, and value added generated by the event. The applications include mega-events (such as the Olympics or FIFA World Cup), hallmark events1\n(such as the Commonwealth Games and World Games) and small-scale regional sports competitions (Connell & Page, 2005; Daniels, 2007; Daniels, Backman, & Backman, 2003; Daniels & Norman, 2003; Dwyer, Forsyth, & Spurr, 2006; Gratton, Dobson, & Shibli, 2000; Gratton, Shibli, & Coleman, 2006; Jones & Munday, 2004; Lee & Taylor, 2005; Manzenreiter, 2008; Preuss, 2007; Ryan & Lockyer, 2001; Wilson, 2006). From Teigland's (1999) perspective, this type of quantitative practice is used to measure the magnitude of the economic peak during the once-only impulse of a sporting event, as these studies capture a snapshot of economic changes on-site during a relatively short period.",

By using visitor numbers or hotel occupancy as measurement variables, the following studies presented a less optimistic result regarding short-term tourism impacts during the event. Du Plessis and Maennig (2011) indicated that the total number of attendees at the 2010 FIFA World Cup (WC) was only one-third of the most conservative ex-ante expectation. Porsche and Maennig (2008) argued that the tourism, employment, and income effects of the 2006 WC were not realized and the greatest outcome of this event was the \u201cfeel-good\u201d effect. Manzenreiter (2008) showed that monthly foreign visitor numbers to Japan during the 2002 WC were no different to other months in the same year for the host country. Allmers and Maennig (2009), using monthly overnight non-resident stay data, demonstrated that the 1998 WC did not produce any statistically significant effects on local hotel suppliers. Porter and Fletcher (2008) pointed out that, during the 1996 Summer Olympics, the occupancy rate in Atlanta rose slightly (2.9%). Similarly, Teigland (1999) indicated that the 1994 Winter Olympic Games was a disappointment for several hotels in the host regions, especially for hotels located approximately 20\u201325 min away from the city center because a strong concentration effect was observed in which visitors occupied hotels that were close to the event venues. This type of general pessimism is also supported for other major sporting events, as Matheson and Baade (2006) and Porter (1999) reported insignificant visitor spending and hotel occupancy rates during the US Super Bowls. Of course, there is supporting evidence regarding short-term positive, significant, and satisfactory tourism effects, including the 1976 Montreal Olympics (Whitson & Horne, 2006), the 1994 World Cup (Baade & Matheson, 2004), the 1997 Flora London Marathon (Gratton, Shibli, & Coleman, 2004), the 2000 Summer Olympic Games (Drayton, 2000), and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games (Porter & Fletcher, 2008).",

Hosting the 2009 World Games (WG), the first international hallmark sporting event in Taiwan, was no different in seeking the same objective. However, despite 4 years of preparation, heightened media attention, and investments of US$218 million, the ex-post analysis for the 2009 WG revealed that the local accommodation sector did not achieve a satisfactory performance with regard to hotel receipts and occupancy rates, nor was an enduring short-term accommodation demand observed afterward. This pattern of the 2009 WG was consistent to the literature on the insignificant tourism effects associated with major sporting events, signaling that a \u201cbig tourist boom\u201d scenario was not realized.",

However, because each region embraces different economic relationships and unique interactions of stakeholders, case studies of individual scenarios shall be adopted and elaborated to provide an insight into factors that may help to address the unsatisfactory tourism performances and lay out the interconnected components (d'Angella & Go, 2009; Solberg & Preuss, 2007). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore factors that may help to address this unexpected short-term soft occupancy rate in the host city by interviewing representatives of the local business sector and municipal government. The study contributes to the literature by deviating from the research agenda of the previous studies, which generally analyzed highly aggregated econometric data without direct contacts with business enterprises.2\nThrough industry and event organizer interviews combined with secondary information, this study provides insights specifically into the accommodation phenomenon. Additionally, the context focuses only on hallmark sporting occasions instead of mega-events, as the former type is the prime target for small economic entities to compete for the right of hosting. Aim of this study is to assist planners of similar future events to improve their forecasting efforts, decisions, and concepts.",

For the month of the WG in July, the occupancy rate of Kaohsiung tourism hotels was 64%, and the general hotels reported 47% occupancy, which was only 2% and 4% higher than the national average respectively. The hotel demand of the 2009 WG did not fit the profile of a bell-shaped demand curve proposed by Teigland (1999). After the event, occupancy in the Kaohsiung area continued to drop and reached its lowest point in September, during which the performance was inferior to the national average. Compared with the 2008 data, the monthly sales of the tourism hotels decreased by 15% from October to November 2009, indicating a weak tourism demand immediately following the event (Taiwan Tourism Bureau, 2008\u20132009).",

In reality, the total number of WG guests and their overall length of stay were much lower than the KOC had previously anticipated. This resulted in low occupancy of reserved rooms. In addition, under the contract with the city government, the unoccupied rooms were not able to be released during the event and the loss of sales was not compensated by the government either. Many managers said that they understood that 100% occupancy was unfeasible, but that an occupancy of 67% from the WG guests and athletes was very disappointing because they did not receive any compensation from the government for any unused reserved rooms.",

From the start of the preparation stage, the IWGA did not permit any package deal that combined WG tickets with local tourism amenities, such as accommodation, transportation, or souvenir discounts. Their position was that each WG event bore a prestigious image, serving as an excellent attraction in itself. Therefore, all event spectators purchased WG tickets independently through a nationwide convenience store network, disregarding their choices of lodging and transportation. Not being able to promote local accommodation services with WG tickets meant that there was no incentive for visitors to stay locally. These aforementioned factors together led to switching behavior of tourists during the event, which resulted in good revenue for hotels located about 30 min away at the expense of low occupancies of hotels in the host city.",

This destruction led to a negative destination image for Kaohsiung City and deterred domestic travel to the area even though all tourism services and attractions were fully functional and accessible in the city (Ko, 2010). In addition to the weather factor, the visit of a political figure, the Dalai Lama, to Kaohsiung City from August 31 to September 4, 2009, and the public screening of the controversial Kadeer film \u201cThe Ten Conditions of Love\u201d during mid-October 2009, both of which were administered by the local government, triggered heated political disputes. Both the Dalai Lama and Kadeer were regarded by the Chinese government as instigating rebellion, and any international recognition given to them would trigger retaliation as these events were perceived by the Chinese government as interference in domestic affairs. The controversy surrounding both events was reported to have hindered the cross-straits relationship as well as bilateral tourism volume between Taiwan and mainland China (McDonald, 2009). Strong rebukes of Kaohsiung City by mainland China were observed through the cancellation of official business visits and diversion of Chinese leisure travelers to other regions in Taiwan without stopping in the city. Hotel managers agreed that these two events led to reduced demand from Chinese tourists who had been an important and emerging market segment for Kaohsiung.",

This concept was originally welcomed by small-scale general hotels and further embraced by 5-star tourism hotels when the KOC and city government officials provided repeated and friendly invitations for them to join the project. The social and intellectual capitals, at that stage, were firmly established when both bodies exchanged trust and mutually agreed that provision of high-quality accommodation services with a large capacity was the core objective of the project.

The last rule was against a typical booking requirement as most hotels would ask for advance payment and a penalty would apply if customers did not show up. One driving factor for the KOC to impose such an atypical restriction was that all of the operations of the 2009 WG were 100% government funded. This required the KOC to comply with the Taiwan Government Procurement Act by paying only for products or services that were transacted (Ministry of Justice, 2011).

Although MATCH was praised for its inclusion of SMME, MATCH's policy created financial burdens on the accommodation providers because it forcefully stipulated the 2010 FIFA room prices as \u201cthe June 2007 room rate plus a 16 percent mark-up\u201d for business operators, and a 30% commission fee was required on top of the net payable FIFA WC rate (Darkey & Horn, 2009; Jago, Dwyer, Lipman, van Lill, & Vorster, 2010; Rose, 2010). The strict accommodation provision agreements led to an outcry from the industry as they complained that the rate was artificially too low, and they felt that MATCH had taken the cream of the accommodation crop as MATCH's profit would be diverted to a UK-based company.",

The success of this type of tour package signals a means to diversify revenue income for the hotel because they can benefit from the provision of associated recreational services. This premise, however, requires close cooperation among the KOC, IWGA, and the local hotel industry to create an image of the \u201cofficial suppliers\u201d. We observed that the KOC website advertised 30 local hotels disregarding whether they have cooperated with the KOC. In other words, no marketing advantages were created solely for those businesses that were contracted. Therefore, one way to assist these partners is to arrange marketing campaigns and price discounts to foster the exclusiveness and competitive advantages of these operators under the banner of the \u201cofficial World Games accommodation service provider\u201d.

Their current business strategies did not adequately adjust to the characteristics of a small island economy in response to large events, rendering their operation at a disadvantage. Observation of the 2009 WG indicated a high percentage of day trips (82%) and a strong displacement effect among individual and group customers to the nearby counties. These customers preferred to commute to the city center instead of staying locally (Sun, 2010). For the first factor, it is crucial for the hotel industry to recognize that Taiwanese event spectators are currently dominated by local residents, followed by regional domestic visitors and very limited numbers of international travelers. Based on a study of four major cultural festivals in Taiwan, local residents accounted for 30%\u201360% of total event participants, whereas international travelers comprised less than 4% (Outdoor Recreation Association, 2005). Although the 2009 WG was a larger scale event with intensive international media exposure, its spectators still conformed to this pattern, showing relative percentages of 57%, 41%, and 3% from local residents, domestic visitors, and international visitors on party trips (Sun, 2010).",

            "text": "In terms of the displacement effect, it has been cited by many researchers as a key factor in leading to less optimistic visitor numbers during the event (Baade & Matheson, 2004; Du Plessis & Maennig, 2011; Fourie, Siebrits, & Spronk, 2011; Manzenreiter, 2008; Porter, 1999). This concept was first raised by Crompton (1995, 2006), as the hosting of a sporting event may drive away potential visitors who may otherwise have come to the community. In the observation of the authors, the crowding-out effect of the WG did not completely drive spectators away (to cancel their visit), but it reduced their willingness to stay locally and shortened their length of stay in the host region. The displacement of tourism is not only observed between cities (regions) but also over time in this instance. From the location perspective, contrary to some literature indicating a strong concentration effect on demand for staying close to the sporting venues (Drayton, 2000; Teigland, 1999), in the case of the 2009 WG, accommodation located about 30 min away was perceived as a good alternative to stay overnight for some spectators. This displacement effect by location can be explained by the island and tourism characteristics of Taiwan. The small and highly populated country has an extensive transportation network of high-speed rail, public transportation, and highway systems, allowing travelers to bear relatively cheap switching costs in terms of time and monetary expenses (Huang & Tai, 2008). In addition, the pricing practice of hotels located around 30 min away from the host city remained relatively constant and cost-effective during the event period, thereby offering a strong \u201cpull factor\u201d in relation to centrally located hotels.",

This was attributed mainly to a self-defeating expectation pattern, that is, the adverse impact on actual demand of exaggerated prices based on the ex-ante anticipation of massive tourist arrivals, which was also reported previously from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa (Du Plessis & Maennig, 2011). In contrast to individual travelers, group customers follow a pre-determined itinerary, and it is difficult to rearrange their accommodation choice once determined. In other words, if accommodation operators observe that their occupancy is less than expected, it is less likely that they can re-secure group customers even if discounted prices are offered. Therefore, the refusal of group customers must be approached with caution as it is against the practice of risk-aversion.",

In coping with these factors, business operation should acknowledge that a high-season room price strategy should be adopted cautiously in Taiwan during the event period. Although local hotels only raised their room rates by 20% during the month of the WG, which is far from the price gouging phenomenon reported in the related literature, the optimistic expectation of all WG spectators paying for premium prices in Kaohsiung is still challenged. Thus, it is necessary to allow a flexible yield management strategy to adjust room price based on unoccupied units over time. In addition, the yield management strategy should simultaneously consider the room inventory allocation in relation to customer segments. The retention of loyal patrons or group customers should be maintained and targeted because this core market provides an ensured amount of sales and revenue intake, serving as a safety net in securing minimum business revenue, even if they produce a less profitable yield. Last and most importantly, offering travel deals that combine accommodation services with exclusive event tickets, complimentary transportation, or souvenirs should be strongly promoted from the business operation itself. These exclusive and quota-limited travel deals should demonstrate the value of staying locally to counter the price advantage of regional hotel competitors.",

Apart from the uncontrollable natural and social factors, practical lessons have been drawn from this World Games experience. First, a hierarchical top-down structure between the event supervising authority, the event organizer, and the broader tourism industry should be avoided. This imbalance of power has been criticized at the 2010 FIFA World Cup (Darkey & Horn, 2009; Rose, 2010), and the dominance of the international sports federation and the government organizing committee has also been identified in this example. This is where the future host country should be cautious about. Second, a community must host events that fit their capabilities to benefit from sports tourism (MacLaurin & Matthews, 2006). One type of capacity lies in the ability to recognize the island and tourism characteristics in shaping their pricing and reservation strategy. For Taiwan, adopting a proper fee strategy, retaining a proportion of group customers, and offering travel deals for exclusive admission tickets or transportation would assist the local businesses to counter the displacement effects of loyal hotel demands to regional competitors.",
