Zoonotic outbreaks are amplified or dampened by a number of ecological, environmental and anthropogenic factors (Karesh et al., 2012). Change in land use is a principal driver for emerging infectious diseases by modifying the wildlife\u2013human interface (Jones et al., 2008). Increase in human populations has caused wild animals to lose their natural habitat and diminished resource availability, while bushmeat hunting and consumption have presented further opportunities for cross\u2010species exposure (Wolfe et al., 2005).",

Bats are reservoirs for many notable pathogenic viruses, including Hendra virus in Australia (Halpin et al., 2000), the recent outbreaks of Ebola virus in sub\u2010Saharan Africa (Pourrut et al., 2009; Olival and Hayman, 2014; Ogawa et al., 2015), rabies and several other lyssaviruses (Banyard et al., 2014). Furthermore, zoonotic coronaviruses (e.g. SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV) and the human coronavirus HCoV\u2010229E, a causal agent of the common cold, appear to have resulted from zoonotic transfer from bats, either directly or through an intermediate amplifying host (Drexler et al., 2014). Indeed, bat coronaviruses are exceptionally diverse and genetic evidence provides further support that group 1 and group 2 mammalian coronaviruses originated in bats (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2015), highlighting the importance of bats as a potential source of new human diseases.",

There are four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus (Adams and Carstens, 2012). Viruses of the Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus genera primarily infect birds, with avian infectious bronchitis virus a prominent member of the latter that causes systemic infections of chickens, resulting in major economic losses (Jackwood, 2012). Alphacoronavirues infect humans (HCoV\u2010229E and HCoV\u2010NL63), pigs, felines, canines and a number of different bat species (Drexler et al., 2014). An alphacoronavirus, that forms a sister group to HCoV\u2010229E, has also been recently found to commonly infect camels (Sabir et al., 2016). Betacoronavirus, which is further classified into lineages A\u2013D, is found in a wide variety of hosts including multiple bat species, humans and numerous domestic and peridomestic animals (Woo et al., 2009). Of note, this genus contains both SARS\u2010CoVs (lineage B) and MERS\u2010CoVs (lineage C).",

Interestingly, coronaviruses have some proof\u2010reading mechanisms and are not subject to the infidelity of the RNA polymerase reading mechanism like other RNA viruses, such as influenza (Drake, 1993; Minskaia et al., 2006). There is a deep phylogenetic divergence between the avian coronavirus\u2010specific genera and the mammalian coronaviruses and a lack of evidence of avian\u2013mammalian cross\u2010species transmission (Woo et al., 2012a); however, there is prolific evidence of these events occurring between different mammal species (Lau et al., 2012) and between different bird species (Chu et al., 2011).",

The RdRp phylogeny places lineage C basal to lineages A, B and D, which form a monophyletic group with only moderate support (bootstrap, BS = 58%). This interlineage relationship is consistent with a recent bat CoV study from Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015). In contrast, in the Hel phylogeny, lineage A is basal to the monophyletic lineages B, C and D (BS = 88%), with lineages B and D forming a strongly supported sister group (BS = 90%). This intrageneric relationship based on the Hel gene is also concordant with previous studies (Lau et al., 2012; Woo et al., 2012b). The E gene phylogeny resembles that of the RdRp in grouping lineages A and D as sister taxa but with low support (BS = 51%). We also compared the genetic divergence of the RdRp gene within the different lineages: lineage D exhibits a higher level of sequence variation with only 58.4% nucleotide identity, in contrast to lineages A (83\u2013100% nucleotide identity), B (92\u2013100%) and C (82\u2013100%) that show a higher percentage similarity. The N gene phylogeny indicated lineage D is basal to other lineages A, B and C; however, this interlineage relationship was statistically insignificant.",

These screening results possibly indicate that there is a low prevalence in the bats in Singapore, low virus titres in the samples and/or we missed shedding foci during our sampling. The only bat species we detected coronaviruses in were the cave nectar bats (E. spelaea), and this was using deep sequencing where the majority of the reads were detected in the urine sample. We did not detect this in the other insectivorous or frugivorous bat species with this well\u2010validated primer set; however, we did not perform NGS on samples from other species in Singapore. The majority of coronavirus detections have been from insectivorous bats, but this may have been spurred by the discovery of SARS\u2010like CoV in Rhinolophus bat species in China (Drexler et al., 2014). Different coronaviruses can infect the same species of bats, even very divergent viruses (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015). The close evolutionary relationship of lineage D betacoronaviruses detected from geographically separated bat species indicates that the spread of lineage D infections in bats is not host\u2010restricted.",

In the tropics, the constant availability of resources means there is less dependence on temporal windows of food. In Malaysia, E. spelaea has been found with dependent young in 8 of 12 months, indicating that individuals are reproducing throughout the year (Kingston et al., 2006), with two peak periods of pregnancy in June and September. In the Philippines, it was also found that E. spelaea has two annual peaks in reproduction although with some variation (Krutzsch, 2005). The first peak centred on March or April while the second centred on or near August (Heideman and Utzurrum, 2003). These bats typically roost in large numbers in caves, although the studied colony in Singapore roosts under an overpass and numbers over 3000 individuals (Lee, unpublished data). This opens up the possibility that there is a persistent source of virus in the colonies and immunologically na\u00efve individuals have the opportunity for exposure from infected bats as they are tightly packed and may fight for specific sites in a roosting area. This is especially true for larger and older males because it is hypothesized that E. spelaea exhibits a resource defence polygynous mating system, where males spend significantly more time and energy for roost defence and surveillance (Bumungsri et al., 2013).",

Hipposideros lekaguli is thought to be associated with Rousettus species and even E. spelaea in SE Asia (Alviola et al., 2015). These species also have a large, overlapping distribution across SE Asia, which may facilitate the emergence of novel coronaviruses (Fig. 2). The foraging ecology of these bats E. spelaea is known to feed on a wide range of plant species and their high visitation frequency to the inflorescence of a few keystone plant species such as Durio zibethinus and Parkia speciosa (Heideman and Utzurrum, 2003; Krutzsch, 2005).

The bat species where lineage D betacoronaviruses have been detected share roosting sites, do so in large numbers and high density and also forage on the same plants. These may be factors that ultimately lead to the emergence of novel virus strains (Table 2). Even though the lineage D betacoronaviruses are not implicated as viruses capable of infecting humans, understanding their evolution can help us understand the evolution and ecological aspects of this medically important virus family. Furthermore, as little is known about the evolutionary factors affecting the transmission of CoVs between hosts, additional studies, such as host cell receptor usage, are required to assess the potential risks of zoonotic transmission to humans.",
