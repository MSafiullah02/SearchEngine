End-point titres of antibody were determined using a pocket calculator preprogrammed to analyse absorbence values of test sera and negative controls. The assay was highly reproducible, and very close agreement was achieved when the results were compared with those of the mouse neutralization test. Rabies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is easy to perform, the results are obtained within 48 hours, and because it employs inactivated virus, the test can be used safely without special containment facilities.",

Several in vitro tests have been developed in recent years in attempts to improve the assay of neutralizing antibody. These include fluorescent focus inhibition [Smith et al, 19731 plaque reduction [Sedwick et al, 19671 , and the interference inhibition test [Nicholson et al, 19791 , none of which can be accomplished without special laboratory facilities and considerable expertise.

Thus, the whole virus particles with intact glycoprotein used in our ELISA should measure true neutralizing antibodies, and the close agreement found in the present study between the MNT and ELISA supports this supposition. Antigen preparations containing disrupted virions presumably bind many clones of antibody not associated with neutralizing activity, and are much less satisfactory. Of notable value is the ability of ELISA to detect rabies antibodies of the IgG class. It is well known that IgM antibody is the initial humoral response to infection or immunisation, and that in infections with viraemia IgM is especially important. However, neither passively transferred not actively induced IgM neutralizing antibody protect mice infected experimentally [Turner, 19781 . Thus, IgG antirabies antibody detected by ELISA may be of greater importance than the early antibody response to infection or immunisation that is measured by neutralization tests.",

It reliably differentiated coded sera taken from unimmunized subjects and vaccinees, it showed that HDCS vaccine can be given successfully at a busy immunisation centre using the ID route, it showed the progressive fall of antibody titres after revaccination, and it failed to show antibody in two subjects who had been vaccinated overseas. The great advantage of the assay is that the antigen is inactivated and can be used safely in routine diagnostic laboratories. Moreover, a large number of samples can be handled in a short period of time with relatively little technical expertise. These factors, together with its high degree of reproducibility, suggest that the ELISA test will become an extremely useful technique for the serodiagnosis of rabies and for measuring the response to vaccination.",
