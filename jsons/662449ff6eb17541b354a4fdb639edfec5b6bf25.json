Individual periodontal lesions may harbor millions of genomic copies of herpesviruses (179) as well as papillomaviruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, torquetenovirus, and hepatitis B and C viruses (190) . Herpesvirus-infected periodontal sites tend to exhibit more breakdown than herpesvirus-free sites, and a herpesviral active infection is associated with an elevated risk of progressive periodontal disease (189) . Furthermore, the oral cavity supports more than 700 bacterial species, and the periodontal pocket area harbors more than 400 bacterial species (148) . Periodontopathic bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, possess virulence factors involved in colonizing periodontal sites, neutralizing local host defenses and destroying periodontal tissues (78, 192) .",

However, it is unclear if various immune mediators, such as certain cytokines and chemokines, exert primarily a protective or a destructive role in periodontal disease. Also, some immune mechanisms that are active against viruses may diminish antibacterial immune responses, and vice versa. It may be that periodontitis is the result of extensive and partly opposing immune responses against viralbacterial combined infections (179) . Major advances in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of periodontitis probably depend upon a better understanding of the pathogenic infections and the associated host responses.",

Worldwide, respiratory infections give rise to more disease and death than any other human infection and are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality (121) . Seasonal influenza in the USA is estimated to result in more than 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths annually (218) . The great \u00d4Spanish flu\u00d5 influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 caused 20-50 million deaths worldwide and an estimated 675,000 deaths in the USA, affecting mostly young adults and not the usual children and old individuals. At the peak, half of the world\u00d5s population was clinically infected. During the influenza pandemic years of 1918-1919 (type A influenza, subtype H1N1) and 1957-1958 (type A influenza, subtype H2N2), the incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia, the most common cause of excess mortality during influenza outbreaks, varied between 2 and 18% in different populations (123) . The influenza A (swine flu) pandemic of 2009 involved a novel H1N1 strain. The main bacteria in influenza-associated pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, alphahemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (123) . A combined infection with influenza viruses and S. aureus causes particularly severe and fatal pneumonia in both children and adults (29) . Respiratory viruses other than the influenza viruses can also interact pathogenically with bacterial pathogens, for example human parainfluenza virus with S. pneumoniae (50) and adenovirus with Bordetella pertussis (185) . A study of community-acquired childhood pneumonia revealed that mixed viralbacterial infections, which comprised about 75% of the pneumonias studied, resulted in more severe inflammation and clinical illness than single viral or bacterial infections (87) .",

Respiratory cells infected with influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial viruses or adenoviruses show enhanced bacterial adherence in both in vitro and in vivo model systems (69) . The influenza virus may predispose to secondary bacterial pneumonia by denudating the respiratory epithelium and exposing basement membrane elements (e.g. fibrinogen) to which bacteria can attach (47, 123 ). An influenza virus infection can also cause prolonged desensitization of lung sentinel cells to toll-like receptor ligands, resulting in a reduced presence of neutrophils and an increased secondary bacterial load (39) .

Infectious mononucleosis caused by infection with Epstein-Barr virus can give rise to tonsillar upgrowth of Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and subsequently pharyngotonsillitis (18) . The Lemierre\u00d5s syndrome, which is characterized by severe pharyngitis and sepsis, can occur as a sequel to Epstein-Barr virus-induced mononucleosis and is frequently associated with an overgrowth of Fusobacterium necrophorum (53) . Gastroenteritis is often associated with mixed infections of viruses (rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, astrovirus) and bacteria (pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni), and the combined viral-bacterial infection can lead to enhanced pathosis (117) . Appendicitis has been associated with measles virus, adenovirus and herpesviruses, as well as with Bacteroides fragilis, E. coli, Yersinia, Salmonella and Shigella (91). In Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, the activation of a latent Epstein-Barr virus infection by monochloramine from infiltrating neutrophils can aggravate the gastric disease (128) . In organ transplant recipients, cytomegalovirus and human herpesviruses type 6 or type 7 can induce serious opportunistic infections with bacteria, fungi, protozoa and other viruses, probably as a result of immunomodulation by the herpesviruses (12, 137, 150) . A renal transplant patient developed a subhepatic abscess as a result of infection with cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis (103) . Vascular diseases occur at a higher frequency as a result of a combined infection with herpes simplex virus and Chlamydia pneumoniae (165) or periodontopathic bacteria (224) than from a single infection with either of these agents. Rheumatic heart disease and autoimmune myocarditis may involve dual infection with coxsackievirus and group A streptococci, which have the potential to dysregulate immune mechanisms and trigger an autoimmune reaction (167) . HIV infection causes a variety of severe bacterial, fungal and viral infections (46, 100, 174, 242) . Moreover, P. gingivalis may up-regulate expression of the HIV-1 R5-specific co-receptor CCR5 in oral keratinocytes and thereby increase the risk for oral infection and dissemination of R5-tropic HIV-1 strains (58) . Also, various gram-positive and gramnegative bacteria of the periodontitis biofilm have the capacity to re-activate HIV in latently infected T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (80) , and the vaginosis bacteria Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, but no other vaginal bacteria studied, are potential activators of HIV expression in monocytoid cells and T-lymphocytic cells (72) .",

Respiratory pathosis was enhanced in mice when the influenza virus or other viruses co-infected with bacteria (198) . In a mouse model of pathogenetic synergy, an influenza virus infection antecedent to an S. pneumoniae challenge caused pneumonia and led to 100% mortality, whereas an infection with S. pneumoniae prior to an influenza virus infection provided protection from influenza and improved survival rates (123) . Immune mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, through toll-like receptors \u2044 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of the influenza virus-S. pneumoniae co-infection (184) . Calves dually infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Haemophilus somnus, both bovine respiratory pathogens, contracted lung disease and harbored H. somnus in the lungs, whereas the lungs of monoinfected calves showed neither pathosis nor H. somnus infection (57) . Acute otitis media was induced in 63% of mice that had been stably colonized by S. pneumoniae and then infected with the influenza virus, whereas all mockinfected mice remained free of disease (122) . Mice infected with herpes simplex virus, adenovirus or vaccinia virus revealed enhanced susceptibility to E. coli pyelonephritis (59) . Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with murine cytomegalovirus together with P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or Candida albicans exhibited mortality rates of 80-100%, whereas immunization against murine cytomegalovirus abrogated the synergistic effect on mortality for all combinations of the infectious agents studied (70) . In immunocompromised rats, a symptomatic infection with rat cytomegalovirus induced severe neutropenia and subsequently a high rate of enteric gramnegative rod bacteremia (201) . A markedly higher mortality rate was found in mice co-infected with murine cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis than in mice mono-infected with either cytomegalovirus or P. gingivalis (203) . A significantly lower level of systemic interferon-gamma was detected in the dually infected mice than in the mono-infected mice, suggesting that P. gingivalis was able to reduce the antiviral interferon-gamma response and thus increase the pathogenicity of the co-infecting cytomegalovirus (203) .",

The use of patient age as a main criterion for distinguishing between \u00d4aggressive\u00d5 and \u00d4chronic\u00d5 periodontitis may not be a reliable indicator of active or stable disease. The term \u00d4normal\u00d5 periodontal site is sometimes used to suggest absence of attachment loss rather than inflammation-free gingiva. As herpesviruses may enter even slightly inflamed periodontal sites, sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques may show viruses in \u00d4unhealthy\u00d5 control sites. Conversely, periodontal therapy can markedly reduce herpesvirus subgingival counts and thus cause a significant underestimation of the viral load associated with untreated disease (177) .

Viral isolation indicates an active and possibly disease-producing infection, but isolation of viruses is difficult, costly and time-consuming. High-fidelity PCR-based techniques have become the standard for identification and quantification of periodontal herpesviruses (99, 146) , and the transcription of late herpesvirus genes for structural proteins is understood to signify productive viral replication and is commonly used to indicate an active herpesvirus infection (60, 124) . PCR identification of oral herpes simplex virus may yield two-to fourfold more positive samples than viral culture (42, 227) . Nested PCR may unveil more periodontal sites that are positive for cytomegalovirus than viral culture or real-time PCR (16) or end-point detection PCR (23) . Nested PCR technology is particularly efficient in detecting low viral loads (168) . However, PCR primers that amplify templates of microbial communities at different efficiencies may yield biased results (86) . Misamplification and falsepositive herpesvirus results may emerge when there are shared regions of nucleotide sequences between herpesvirus species and unknown infectious agents. Nevertheless, as periodontal Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus have been identified using a variety of PCR primers in platforms of end-point detection PCR, nested PCR, reverse transcription PCR and realtime PCR, the risk of a systematic misidentification of these viruses is small. However, different PCR primers and protocols may detect herpesviruses with a varying degree of proficiency (28) , and technical expertise and quality assurance methods vary among laboratories (102, 144, 183) . Preparation of the target nucleic acid constitutes a particularly vulnerable stage of PCR protocols.",

In addition, herpesviruses occur at a higher prevalence in low-income countries than in affluent countries (3) , and the herpesvirus seroprevalence in high-income countries exhibits significant racial, educational and socioeconomic disparities, starting at an early age and persisting into middle age (43, 44, 243) .",

Although the prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus was similar in aggressive and chronic periodontitis, the herpesvirus infection may differ qualitatively in the two diseases. An active (\u00d4productive\u00d5) cytomegalovirus infection tends to be associated with periodontal sites showing no radiographic evidence of alveolar crestal lamina dura (211, 219), a finding consistent with disease-active periodontitis (158) . An active cytomegalovirus infection has also been linked to increased gingival inflammation in immunosuppressed organ-transplant recipients (141) . An acute herpes simplex virus-type 1 infection in a 26year-old patient caused, within a few hours, extensive gingival recession (155) . By contrast, a latent (\u00d4non-productive\u00d5) herpesvirus infection is generally associated with chronic periodontitis sites exhibiting little propensity for disease progression (16) .",

            "text": "Quantitatively, significantly more herpesvirus genomic copies inhabit progressive and untreated periodontitis lesions than stable or treated periodontitis sites (89, 90, 179) . As many as 8.3 \u00b7 10 8 Epstein-Barr virus DNA copies and 4.6 \u00b7 10 5 cytomegalovirus DNA copies have been detected in samples of individual periodontal pockets (179) , and even higher viral loads may reside within the gingival tissue of periodontitis lesions (98). Sunde et al. (208) identified up to one million genome-copies of Epstein-Barr virus in periodontal sites of a 63 year-old patient with refractory periodontitis. Herpesviruses other than Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus (110, 118, 138, 152, 168) , as well as papillomavirus and other viruses (189) , can also inhabit periodontitis lesions. Indeed, the total count of viruses approaches that of bacteria in some advanced periodontitis lesions. The abundance of herpesvirus genomic copies in individual periodontitis lesions translates into a heavy viral load for the entire periodontium of patients with severe and widespread periodontal disease. The high number of herpesviral copies in progressive periodontitis has implications for our understanding of the etiology of the disease. Table 2 summarizes statistical relationships between periodontal herpesviruses and bacteria. A study in China found that 17% of Epstein-Barr virus-positive periodontitis lesions, and 54% of cytomegalovirus-positive periodontitis lesions, contained as many as six to eight species of major periodontopathic bacteria (40) . Periodontal Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus seem to be most closely associated with P. gingivalis and T. forsythia (179) , two bacteria with high periodontopathic potential (78) . The link between cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis appears to be particularly strong (193) . Cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis were linked to localized aggressive (juvenile) periodontitis in Jamaica with odds ratios of 4.6 and 7.8, respectively, but the cytomegalovirus-P. gingivalis dual infection was linked to the disease with an odds ratio as high as 51.4 (125) . The significantly higher odds ratio of the cytomegalovirus-P. gingivalis co-infection than of the sum of the individual pathogens is suggestive of a pathogenetic synergy between the infectious agents. A study, in the USA, of 140 adults with gingivitis or periodontitis, linked Epstein-Barr virus-1 and cytomegalovirus to elevated occurrence of the pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola ( Table 3 ). In a study from Japan, P. gingivalis comprised 0.25% of total salivary bacterial counts in Epstein-Barr virus-positive periodontitis patients but only 0.02% (a 13-fold difference) in Epstein-Barr virus-negative patients (205) . Periodontal Epstein-Barr virus (179, 207) and cytomegalovirus (85, 125, 140, 219) have also been related to the subgingival presence of the major periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. An association between herpesviruses and anaerobic bacteria has also been demonstrated in periapical pathosis (171) .",

A predominance of Th1 cells in disease-stable sites may suggest a successful anti-herpesvirus defense, and elevated levels of Th1 cells in progressing lesions may reflect an ongoing effort by the host to control an active herpesvirus infection. Similarly, the dis-pute about a dominance of either T cells or B cells in periodontitis sites may be partly unfounded (11, 71) . A preponderance of T cells may reflect the attempt of the host to control an active herpesvirus infection. High B-cell counts may be caused by specific antibody production or the result of an active Epstein-Barr virus infection, which, in the absence of sufficient cytotoxic T-cell function, can induce B-cell proliferation by polyclonal stimulation (21) .",

The effector cells recognize viral proteins via toll-like receptors, natural killer cell receptors or other pattern recognition receptors. Herpesvirus DNA reacts with toll-like receptor 9, which is significantly up-regulated in periodontitis lesions compared with gingivitis lesions (88) . Cells of innate immunity employ cytokine secretion and cell-mediated cytotoxicity as the primary anti-herpesvirus effector mechanisms. Macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes can destroy antibody-coated virions or virus-infected cells via reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and activated caspases. Natural killer cells are an important source of interferon-gamma and are able to kill herpesvirus-infected cells via virus-specific antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or via antibody-independent mechanisms.

Anti-herpesvirus cytotoxic \u2044 suppressor T cells, which are present at elevated levels in aggressive periodontitis lesions (187) , may adversely affect mammalian cells involved in the antibacterial periodontal defense. Th1 cytokines associated with active herpesvirus infections reduce Th2-cell responses and thereby the antibody-mediated control of pathogenic bacteria. Herpesviruses are capable of subverting macrophage (51, 63, 109) , complement (111) and neutrophil (1) functions of importance in the antibacterial host defense. P. gingivalis and other exogenous-like species, which may be primarily controlled by antibody-mediated mechanisms (159, 215) , may benefit most from a reduction in antibacterial immunity and outgrow co-existing indigenous microorganisms. Taken together, an active herpesvirus infection has the potential to impair antibacterial host defenses and may trigger a microbial shift towards a more virulent subgingival microbiota.",

Periodontal viruses may be identified successfully by using diagnostic DNA microarrays that are able to detect simultaneously herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus as well as other viruses (134); or by using multiplex real-time PCR techniques to quantify simultaneously the number of genome-copies of herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus-6 (49, 67) .

The notion of herpesviralbacterial synergism in periodontitis implies that vaccination against herpesviruses can also contribute to the control of periodontopathic bacteria. One difficulty to overcome with prophylactic vaccination is declining immunity over time, which carries an increased risk of delayed-onset primary herpesvirus diseases with increased morbidity.

An active herpesvirus infection in the periodontium may give rise to systemic viremia, but the magnitude and duration of this are unknown.",

            "text": "An active herpesvirus infection correlates with periodontitis disease activity and may be a major contributor to the periodontal immune response. Herpesviruses are potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines that have the potential to activate osteoclasts and matrix metalloproteinases. An active herpesvirus infection can also impair antibacterial immune mechanisms and potentially cause an upgrowth of periodontopathic bacteria. Some periodontopathic bacteria may re-activate a latent herpesvirus infection. Synergism among herpesviruses and bacteria may play an important role in the onset and progression of periodontitis. The interplay of herpesviruses and bacteria in periodontitis may be compared to a marionette theater where the puppeteer is the virus and the puppets are the bacteria. Even if the puppeteer (virus) controls the performance (disease), both the puppeteer and the puppets are necessary for the marionette theater to function.",

            "text": "Obviously, it is difficult to link a herpesvirus infection that occurs in childhood to periodontitis that debuts several decades later. An important question is whether the herpesvirus-periodontitis association is etiologically based or is merely an epiphenomenon to gingival inflammation. Studies on herpesviral etiology of medical diseases face similar difficulties in delineating cause and effect. To distinguish between causality and correlation, information is needed on the extent to which an active herpesvirus infection gives rise to destructive periodontal disease, and the extent to which diseaseactive periodontitis may activate a latent herpesvirus infection. A causal relationship may be inferred if the removal of herpesviruses by specific antiviral medication arrests, reverses or prevents periodontitis. Studies assessing temporal and histological correlations may also help to elucidate the role of herpesviruses in periodontal disease. Such studies may take advantage of molecular techniques able to quantify herpesvirus loads and relate either active or latent herpesvirus infection to periodontitis-disease activity. However, the definitive answer to the periodontopathic significance of herpesviruses will probably have to await the development of efficacious antiherpesvirus vaccines.",

Herpesvirus-induced periodontitis implies that anti-herpesvirus immunity constitutes an important aspect of achieving a long-lasting state of stable periodontal conditions. The development of herpesvirus vaccines in the not too distant future makes the topic of periodontopathic herpesviruses particularly intriguing. Control of herpesviruses by vaccination may foreshadow a future with a diminishing role for the traditional periodontal therapies of surgery and antibiotics. It is hoped that the issues raised in this review will help to steer periodontal research into new fertile fields of investigation.",
