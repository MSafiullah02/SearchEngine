The Reynolds number is proportional to the radius of the airway, the average velocity of gas flow in the airway, and the gas density, and inversely proportional to gas viscosity. Narrowed airways will predispose to turbulent rather than laminar flow, as the average velocity in these segments is greatly increased. Failure to maintain laminar flow in airways will result in an increase in the work of breathing. Helium has a similar viscosity to oxygen and nitrogen, but a much lower density. Heliox is a mixture of 79% helium and 21% oxygen and its low density provides favourable flow dynamics in narrowed airways by keeping the Reynolds number low and hence supporting laminar flow.",
