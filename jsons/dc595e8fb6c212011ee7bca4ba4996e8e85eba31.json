By March 13, with over 2700 cases confirmed in the US, the American College of Surgeons recommended the cessation of elective surgeries. \"Social distancing\" became common lingo, and large gatherings, including educational conferences, were abruptly canceled. Medical students were pulled off rotations to protect them from exposure and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Over the following weeks, most hospitals reduced their nonessential surgery volume, performing only surgeries that were emergent, urgent, or time sensitive. One week later, more than 25,000 COVID-19 cases were confirmed, present in all 50 states. The rapid evolution of healthcare delivery into telehealth and telephonebased models changed our clinical landscape drastically. Normal inpatient volumes decreased as hospitals prepared for the surge of COVID-19 cases and potential redeployment of physicians into areas of need. We adapted rapidly. However, this was only part of the challenge that academic hospitals would face.",

Critical to training the next generation of neurosurgeons is a combination of didactic conferences and experiences as well as hands-on surgical education. When in-person didactics are canceled and surgical volume is significantly reduced, how does a program adapt education rapidly? In addition, with increasing concern for an inadequate supply of PPE, how do we as educators protect our residents from harm while knowing that their knowledge, experience, and grit are exactly what is necessary to help the medical workforce during this crisis?",

Published experiences out of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto represent some of the only accounts of the effect on medical education. In March 2003, both medical schools in Hong Kong were forced to abruptly transition undergraduate medical education into a recorded lecture format, and students were taken out of clinical rotations until the new cases had ceased. 1 One month later, the University of Toronto suspended student education in teaching hospitals. 2 Singapore reflected on this opportunity to embrace technological advances in web-based learning and simulation but also noted the importance in training medical students in the use of PPE. 3 A rare perspective on how such an epidemic impacted resident training was written by Sherbino and Atzema in 2004. 4 Their account as residents in the emergency department at the University of Toronto highlights the impact on resident education. As with the current pandemic, elective cases were halted, staff was screened for fevers and symptoms at the entrance, out-ofcity electives were postponed, and in-person conferences were eliminated. Their altered educational experience spanned one-third of the academic year.",

Most programs have seen a significant drop in elective or nonessential surgical volume, impacting the functional neurosurgery cases foremost. Unruptured aneurysm surgery, spine surgery, benign tumors, and other less urgent surgical cases have been postponed. New information on the particular risk of nasopharyngeal cases with virus shedding has caused many centers to reconsider offering endonasal surgery. Several centers are only continuing with neurosurgical emergencies that are typically limited to neurotrauma, shunts, stroke, malignant tumors, and cord compression. Naturally, patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage require treatment as well. In addition, surgeries that will allow patients to leave the hospital continue. Overall, programs report a significant decrease in the volume of cases. Clinic visits have transitioned to telemedicine where possible, decreasing resident exposure to outpatient encounters.",

Many programs report decreasing resident staffing to 50% of normal, allowing teams to rotate on for a week at a time, while keeping the remainder of the residents at home and away from exposure. Surgical cases are limited to a single resident to preserve PPE. Resident rounds include only the necessary personnel in person, and communication is largely moving to electronic forms. Mitigating exposure risk has extended to resident conferences with many programs reporting a transition to virtual conferences by using videoconference technology and holding more frequent sessions to compensate for decreased operative case exposure. A joint statement from the presidents of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons mentions the plans for available online education to be rolled out in the coming months, and in fact the CNS just started a Virtual Visiting Professor program as part of this initiative.",
