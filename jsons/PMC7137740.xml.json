            "text": "In March, 2006, the State Council of the People's Republic of China officially announced the first legislation directly aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS: the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations.1 These regulations, together with the Five-Year Action Plan to Control HIV/AIDS (2006\u20132010),2 are an important step in the development of government policy related to the care and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Although bold, these regulations were passed more than 20 years after the first case of HIV infection was identified. The development of a coherent policy was the result of a long and unsystematic process that involved initial mis-steps, considerable domestic and international education, debate, iterative trial-and-error learning, and scientific studies. The new legislation resulted from communication and coordination among many agencies, including administrators, service providers, politicians, the scientific community, and policymakers. We describe the influence of scientific studies and other factors on the development of HIV/AIDS policy in China and provide a timeline of important milestones in the development of the current policy (figure 1\n). This review is intended as a general overview of progress in China and does not attempt to provide a detailed account of province-to-province variation in the evolution and implementation of HIV prevention and control strategies.",

In the mid-1990s, the occurrence of a second major outbreak in commercial plasma donors in the east-central provinces became apparent.5 Plasma donors were paid to donate blood, the plasma removed, then the red blood cells reinfused to prevent anaemia. Reuse of tubing and mixing during collection and reinfusion led to thousands of new infections.6, 7 At the same time, HIV was also spreading through sexual transmission. By 1998, HIV had reached all 31 provinces and was in a phase of exponential growth (figure 2\n),8 which, by 2005, had culminated in an estimated 650 000 infections.9\n",

These early policies did little to stop transmission of HIV; in fact, they probably promoted concealment of risk activities and made identification of HIV reservoirs more difficult.18, 19, 20\n",

China's Titanic Peril,23 published by the UN in 2002, made the unsubstantiated prediction that China could have 10 million HIV-infected individuals by 2010, a figure that has been repeatedly misused in discussions of China's HIV future. A Joint Assessment of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care in China (2004),8 developed jointly by UNAIDS and the State Council of China, estimated that China had 840 000 people living with HIV/AIDS. This figure has been revised down to 650 000 in 2005 in light of more representative data collection and more appropriate estimation methods.9 Although this figure represented a prevalence of about 0\u00b705%, it was substantially higher than previous government estimates (300 000 in 199821) and provided the impetus for immediate scale-up of prevention and control strategies.",

Those testing HIV positive need only fulfil criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of the clinics, a database was established to gather data on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients.

The services offered at such clinics have been broadened and provide access to other services, including HIV and hepatitis testing, antiretroviral therapy for eligible AIDS patients, group activities, and skills training for employment. The use of methadone maintenance therapy has been incorporated into the AIDS Regulations as a treatment for heroin addiction. Additionally, the requirements for entrance into methadone maintenance treatment programmes have been relaxed to encourage greater access. For example, patients are no longer required to have local residency or a previous history of internment in a detoxification centre. The programme is not without problems, however, and retaining drug users in the programme remains a critical challenge.",

In 1996, the Southern Weekend newspaper ran a front-page story and devoted another two pages to AIDS in China. This coverage was the first time any comprehensive exposure of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China had been published by the Chinese press. From 1999, the international and subsequently the national media reported on the thousands of infected plasma donors in Henan and neighbouring provinces who did not have access to services. Although the government had acted quickly when the tragedy became apparent in 1995 by shutting down collection stations and, later, introducing new laws and regulations on the collection and management of blood and blood products,6, 57, 58 provision of HIV testing, prevention, and care for donors in the local areas was slower. Progress was stimulated by the media's attention to the plight of the infected plasma donors. Since these initial reports, the HIV/AIDS situation in China has received much attention from the local and international media.",

This increased identification explains, at least in part, the rapid rise in reported HIV cases in the early 21st century (figure 2).

Stigma is well recognised as a major barrier to HIV control, because it prevents people from seeking services for testing and treatment, and discourages people from practising safer behaviours.59, 65, 66 To address this issue, senior political figures have been involved in anti-discrimination campaigns, and have publicly shown that HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact. For example, on World AIDS Day, Dec 1, 2003, Premier Wen Jiabao publicly shook hands with AIDS patients in Beijing Ditan Hospital.67 The day before the 2004 World AIDS Day, President Hu Jintao and other senior government leaders visited patients living with HIV/AIDS and called for the elimination of bias against this group.68 During the Chinese New Year celebrations in 2005, Premier Wen Jiabao visited the homes of HIV-infected villagers in Henan province. These actions had a tremendous effect on the general community, and have now been backed up by policy changes. The AIDS Regulations have made it illegal to discriminate against people living with HIV/AIDS and their families in terms of their rights to schooling, employment, health services, and participation in community activities. Furthermore, the AIDS Regulations and the 2004 revision of the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Disease69 include language to protect the identity and disease status of those with an infectious disease, with disciplinary action recommended for those individuals or institutions that violate these laws. Although there had been language in previous regulations to protect the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, these new laws give such individuals and their families a stronger basis from which to defend their rights.",

Although China has a strong central government, provincial and lower levels of government enjoy a great deal of autonomy, which has resulted in a mixed response and inconsistent enforcement of HIV/AIDS policy. For example, Yunnan province has shown strong support for implementation and advocacy of harm-reduction strategies that reduce HIV transmission in its many drug users, whereas Henan province had been slower to respond to the needs of former plasma donors in the early stages of the epidemic.84 Moreover, the distribution of HIV in China is not even, and is concentrated in areas with high drug use (eg, Yunnan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Sichuan) and in areas where people were infected through unsafe blood or plasma donation (eg, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, and Hubei). The number of cases ranges dramatically between provinces (figure 5\n), with, for example, just 20 cases reported from Tibet but well over 40 000 in neighbouring Yunnan. In provinces with an extremely low prevalence, it can be difficult for officials to see the need for HIV prevention and control.",

But many of those willing to work in rural areas do not have formal medical qualifications to begin with, which limits their abilities to understand the complexities of treating HIV patients.89 Furthermore, health services rely heavily on user fees, which often encourages health workers to do additional, chargeable services that many people living with HIV/AIDS cannot afford.90\n",
