When HBoV screening was subsequently adopted into the routine respiratory diagnostic pathway, year-round infections were observed in both children and adults peaking in February. 185 of 9098 (2.03%) individuals were found to be HBoV positive with children aged 12-24 months the principally infected group. However, HBoV infection was also observed in patients aged over 60, predominantly as a monoinfection. 23% of the 185 unique patients were HBoV monoinfectedand persistent low-level DNA positivity was observed in 15 individuals up to 6-months after initial presentation. Conclusion HBoV1 is a prevalent respiratory infection in the UK capable of causing serious monoinfections.",

Despite HBoV1's frequent detection in respiratory samples from subjects with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), its role as a respiratory pathogen is not fully understood. High rates of co-infection (up to 70-80% in some studies) with predominantly Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, Adenovirus [5, 6] and also frequent detection in asymptomatic subjects [7] , have promoted a hypothesis of HBoV1 as a \"passenger\" virus [5, 7, 8] .

Furthermore, the virus has been associated with respiratory symptoms in the absence of other viral, fungal, or bacterial agents, with a significant detection rate difference between cases and controls [5]. HBoV1 has been associated not only with self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, but also lower respiratory tract symptoms including wheezing, bronchiolitis, respiratory distress, and pneumonia [5, 8] . Indeed, there are several documented cases of bocavirus infection associated with severe lower respiratory illness requiring hospitalization, oxygen therapy, and even intensive care [14] [15] [16] [17] .

HBoV1 was found to persist in mucosa for more than four months following primary infections, which increases the chances of co-existence with other viral or bacterial pathogens [23, 24] and the virus has been suggested to reactivate following a superinfection with another virus [4].We similarly observed persistence of HBoV in our cohort for up to 6 months. HBoV1's high prevalence could also explain the high rate of co-infections. One study estimated HBoV1 infection rate to be as high as 59% in a cohort of children with respiratory illness and another reported that ~90% of adults have HBoV-specific antibodies [23, 25] . It is clear that detection of HBoV DNA can persist for many months, and therefore the presence of such DNA does not necessarily indicate a recent infection.",

Study design We initially investigated the undiagnosed burden of HBoV in a retrospective paediatric cohort sampled between 2015 and 2017 using an in-house PCR assay. HBoV was subsequently incorporated into the standard respiratory diagnostic pathway and we audited a calendar year of HBoV positive results between 2018 and 2019. Results Our retrospective PCR screening of previously routine diagnosticnegative samples from juvenile patients identified a 9% (n=30) prevalence of HBoV type 1. These apparentHBoV1 mono-infections were frequently associated with respiratory tract symptoms, often J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Introduction Human Bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) was first identified in respiratory tract samples in 2005 and three further genotypes (HBoV2, 3, and 4) were subsequently detected in faecal specimens [1-3]. HBoV types 1-4 were determined to be members of the Bocaparvovirus genus in the Parvoviridae family, with sequence similarity to both bovine parvovirus and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f canine minute virus",

A second study period (September 2018 to August 2019) investigated all respiratory samples (not limited by sample type or age) received for routine clinical diagnosis at NUHT. In this period, samples were routinely assessed with the AusDiagnostics Respiratory Viruses (16-well) target panel (REF 20602) for the High-Plex 24 system (REF 9150), including an HBoV target.

Subsequently in August 2018 we began screening for HBoV in routine respiratory investigations using a commercial assay (AusDiagnostics) and undertook an audit of a calendar year of screening between 1 st September 2018 and 31 st August 2019. In this period 12,498 unique specimens were received for routine respiratory pathogen investigation, of which 208 (1.66%) were HBoV positive representing 185 of 9098 unique patients (2.03%). HBoV ranked 7 th in viral prevalence behind Rhinovirus or Enterovirus (non-differentiated), Influenza A, RSV, Human Adenovirus, Parainfluenza Type 3 (PF3), Coronavirus and Human Metapneumovirus, but ahead of PF1, PF4, Parechovirus, PF2 and Influenza B (data not shown). Of the 208 positive specimens recorded, 165 (75.96%) were co-infected and 43 were from HBoV mono-infected patients (23.24%). Six mono-and 10 co-infected individuals were found to be HBoV positive during intensive care. Two of the 10 co-infected individuals had HBoV copy numbers 5-to 6-logs higher than the co-infecting virus. 116 (56%) of the 208 positive samples were throat swabs, 35% NPAs and 9% others including broncheoalveolar lavages, endotracheal aspirates and sputum. HBoV positivity rates by sample type were 73/1347 (5.42%) of NPAs, in contrast to only 116/10,249 (1.13%) of throat swabs and 19/902 (2.11%) of other samples received. Three individuals were sampled by both throat swab and NPA on the same or consecutive days. Two returned higher viral load values in the NPA (24-and 28-fold more viral target) whilst one indicated a 28-fold higher viral load in the throat swab compared to the NPA (data not shown). To determine if HBoV1 infections were associated with seasonality, weekly HBoV positivity rates were investigated (Figure 1). Whilst HBoV positive samples were seen throughout the calendar year (commencing in week 36 of 2018 and finishing in week 35 of 2019) a peak of positivity was observed around the middle of February (week 7 of 2019, Figure 1).

Sample HBoV1 positivity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and BLAST analysis, revealing circa 99% conservation with Genbank HBoV1 reference strains in the conserved 298bp NS1/2 region targeted (data not shown). To further confirm identity and investigate potential HBoV1 sequence variability and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f relatedness, a larger 1798 bp fragment of the NS1 gene was amplified from 20 of the 30 positive samples. The products were sequenced from the 5' end only, yielding 1170 bp from each patient (covering bases 366-1535 of the prototypical reference isolate NC007455, [1] and aligned with 196 reference sequences of HBoV1-4 downloaded from Genbank in May 2017. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction of this NS1 region confirmed strong bootstrap support for genotypic clustering of our positives with HBoV1 reference sequences (>0.99, data not shown). However, little support for any other phylogenetic inference was observed due to a high degree of genetic conservation observed in both study and reference HBoV1 sequences.Having identified the presence of previously undiagnosed HBoV1 infection in a significant proportion of NPA specimens investigated, clinical data in this pilot cohort were also retrospectively assessed(Table 1).
