            "text": "During the past decade, therapeutic potential of medicinal and aromatic plants with rich contents of secondary bioactive metabolites have received increased attention for scientific investigation. Despite the progress in synthetic drug chemistry, plants still constitute an important source of new products of medicinal value for pharmaceuticals, used commercially either as an antioxidants or nutritional supplements (Zhang and Bj\u00f6rn 2009). Among the many medicinal plants routinely used as Ayurvedic medicines in India, some of these plants have been featured in Fig. 1. Many of the herbal drugs are simple synthetic modifications of these naturally plant derived secondary metabolites. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid by consumers and researchers to the health and nutritional aspects of metabolites such as phenolics, vitamins, minerals and others. Secondary metabolites biosynthesis is a new tool in the generation of novel and expensive natural products. Many of these phytocompounds; phenols, flavonoids, steroids, alkaloids, terpenoids, anthocyanins, glycoscynates, \u03b2-carotene, ascorbic acid, polyamines, synaptic ester, volatile oil, having high antioxidant potential, be helpful in treatments of several oxidative stress related disorders (Krishnaiah et al. 2007; Kaur and Arora 2009). These antioxidants mitigate the risk of number of chronic and cardiovascular problems and other free radical mediated diseases including neuro degeneration (Nambiar et al. 2010). Finding new natural sources of antioxidant compounds with potential antiradical activity can be useful to future therapy against various stress related health problems.\n",

In addition, Environmental factor also influence accumulation of key compounds. Ultraviolet-B radiation (280\u2013310 nm) is one factor, expected to modify the chemical composition of plants and induces changes in level of secondary metabolites. Recently, the knowledge about the treatment response of UV-B exposure on different plant metabolites in terms of \u201chealth beneficial aspects\u201d is exponentially increasing and has led to novel insights, especially as far as medical, pharmacological and nutritive aspects are concerned (Jansen et al. 2008). Evidently, based on findings by various researchers this novel concept may be presented that, UV-B supplementation might be beneficial for sustainable agriculture, food and nutritional industries for determining the high commercial utilization of these natural medicinal products (Kumari et al. 2009a, c; Kumari and Agrawal 2010; Sun et al. 2010; Eichholz et al. 2011).",

            "text": "The growing demand of plant-based medicines, health products, pharmaceuticals, food supplements, in etc., is putting an unsustainable threatening on forests resulted in increased hazard and extinction of several species, because of overexploitation of wild plant populations. Forests contribute to more than 90% of the medicinal plants used for manufacturing medicines. Large-scale wild harvesting from the forests has caused serious depletion of a number of economically-important species, loss of genetic biodiversity, environmental degradation. According to estimate, more than 4,000 species of medicinal plants are globally threatened, largely due to commercial over-harvesting to meet the demand from pharmaceutical industries (Schippmann et al. 2002). So on, conservation of medicinal plants is needed for a number of reasons. Firstly, they are an important source of natural ingredients used by the manufacturers of modern pharmaceuticals. Second, its tremendous use as botanical dietary supplements in past few decades, leads to continuous erosion of forest and the forest product (Kala et al. 2006). Shifting from wild harvesting to cultivation techniques appeared to be an important alternative strategy to overcome the problem (Uniyal et al. 2000). In cultivation, agro-technological processing can be manipulated in order to achieve desired products, increased yield or stable concentrations of biologically active phytocompounds and reduced toxin level of botanical products (Canter et al. 2005). Cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants gives scope to optimize yield and achieve a uniform, high quality product at cost of least destruction (Wiersum et al. 2006). As a concluding remark, in this section, we summarized the aspects of biodiversity loss related to wild harvesting of plants and cultivation strategy of medicinal plants from the wild, to be \u2013 of better option, to conserve valuable wild medicinal plants.",

            "text": "The use of herbal drugs is widespread and serves as leading research for the development of novel pharmacological agents. A large number of medicinal plant species have already been tested for their potential biological, therapeutic and pharmaceutical activities worldwide (Majhenic et al. 2007; Mata et al. 2007; Wannissorn et al. 2005). Several studies from different countries have confirmed their antioxidants activity in various plants having rich medicinal value (Desmarchelier et al. 1998; Liu and Ng 2000; Souri et al. 2008; Ayoola et al. 2008). Fenglin et al. (2004) have screened the free radical scavenging activity of Chinese medical woody plants showed that most of them are employed for their effects on hemostasis, as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial or for treatment of dysentery and there medicinal uses may be directly linked to the content in tannins and flavonoids and consequently to their free radical scavenging activities. Zakaria (2007) identified the biochemical compounds such as Flavonoids, triterpenes, saponins and tannins responsible for the observed antioxidant activity in some herbal species; e.g. Muntingia calabura; Bauhinia purpurea; Dicranopteris linearis; Melastoma malabathricum; Corchorus capsularis. Pourmorad et al. (2006) noticed that greater amount of phenolic compounds relates with higher radical scavenging effects in Mellilotus officinalis. In India also, several investigators has been worked at this specific context in assessing the antioxidant capacity of herbal medicine (Chanda and Dave 2009; Kaur et al. 2008; Ali et al. 2008). Prakash et al. (2007) have identified the total phenol, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of some Indian medicinal plants, e.g. Azadirachta indica, Cassia fistula, Casuarina equisetifolia, Indigofera tinctoria, Lawsonia inermis and Trewia nudiflora. These plants are having high phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Kshirsagar and Upadhyay (2009) have studied the antioxidative effects of 32 plant species from Tripura, northeastern India and observed that 16 of them e.g. Mitragyna rotundifolia, Schima walichii, Syzigium cerasoides and others showed higher antioxidants potential depends on their dose dependent activity. Jain et al. (2010) have studied on Alangium salvifolium and reported that the extract from its roots have interesting potential free radical scavenging activity for treatment of diseases. Patel et al. (2010) worked on antioxidant activity of some selected medicinal plants from western region of India and screened the high radical scavenging activity in the stem of Kigelia followed by leaf of Hibiscus, Gemelia and Kigelia. Since the phyto-constituents and volatiles of medicinal herbs have created renewed demand in their use by the public, explorations of health benefits and antioxidant potential of these metabolites in the prevention of oxidative stress problems is needed. This part described the summarized view on antioxidant activity of various medicinal plants. Most of the medicinal plants are rich antioxidants due to its different active ingredients that determine its antioxidant potential.",

An aggregate accent of documented works done so far on the impact of UV-B radiation on volatile oil yield and its qualitative composition in some medicinal plants are shown in Table 2. The contribution of UV-B radiation to stimulation of volatile production and changes in active constituents composition has been examined experimentally by various other researchers as reported in Ocimum basilicum (Johnson et al. 1999; Nitz and Schnitzler 2004; Chang et al. 2009), Mentha spicata (Karousou et al. 1998), Mentha piperita (Maffei and Scannerini 2000); Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Afreen et al. 2005). Dolzhenko et al. (2010) reported in study on peppermint that UV-B radiation prompted the higher content of menthol and phenolic compounds as the modulation of expression of some specific genes involved in essential oil biogenesis (which show menthol production) was usually up-regulated by UV-B irradiation. Moderate and low dose UV-B supplementation are reported to increased the essential oil yield in a important Indian medicinal plant Acorus calamus and shown to improve it\u2019s health value by reducing the content of potentially toxic constituents \u03b2- asarone (Kumari et al. 2009c).

            "text": "Many of plant-derived phenylpropanoids such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids, anthocyanins, coumarines, and lignans are secondary products of shikimate metabolism (Korkina 2007). Expression levels of several genes encoding key enzymes of secondary biosynthetic pathway are being elevated in a coordinated trend at UV-B and other environmental stress signals (Long and Jenkins 1998). Figure 4 showed the diagrammatic representation of different metabolic steps involves in shikimate pathway of phenylpropanoids biosynthesis and it\u2019s regulation in response to UV-B radiation. The first enzyme of the shikimate pathway \u201c3-deoxy-D4 arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase\u201d (DAHP synthase) that catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate to yield 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) is reportedly induced by UV-B irradiation (Ramani et al. 2010). It proposed that selective transcription of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, chalcone synthase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate: coenzyme A ligase genes, coding functional enzymatic variants, may control the synthesis of phenylpropanoid products also being induced by UV-B stress factor.\n",

            "text": "The stimulation of terpene biosynthesis by oxidative stress is well known (Beaulieu 2007). The biosynthesis of terpenes starts with isopreneoid unit with precursors of isopentenyl and dimethylallyl diphosphate. Activation of two independent pathway cytosolic acetyl mevalonate, that provides precursor for sesquiterpene and sterols and/or plastidial 1-desoxy-D-xylose-5-phosphate/methyl D-erythritol phosphate for isopentenyl and dimethylallyl diphosphate precursors (Hampel et al. 2005). In a recent publication on grapevine leaves, Gil et al. (2012) suggest that UV-B modulates the metabolism of terpenes leading to specific responses according to fluence rate of UV-B. Relatively low UV-B irradiation induces the de novo synthesis of enzymes of terpene cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway leading to production of terpenes, triterpenes and sterols, while high UV-B irradiance promoted the production of plastidic diterpenes via the methylerytritol phosphate pathway. The effect of increased UV-B irradiation on the expression of genes involved in early steps of terpenoid biosynthesis was reported in peppermint oil by Dolzhenko et al. (2010). \u201cThey observed that UV-B irradiation increased the content of some monoterpenes e.g. methol) and sesquiterpenes\u201d e.g. \u03b2-caryophyllene and germacrene-D which correlates with induced up-regulation of genes involved such as Dxs, Ippi, Gpps, and Fpps. Alkaloid biosynthesis in plants is also tightly controlled in response to UV-B stress. Tryptophan decarboxylase, a key enzyme in biosynthesis of the precursor tryptamine needed for monoterpene indole alkaloid production, can be strongly induced by UV-B light at the level of transcription (Ouwerkerk et al. 1999).",
