It is reported that CypA\u2013CsA binding might inhibit the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin, thereby blocking the production of cytokines including interleukin-29 and interferon \u03b3.10\n",

Structure-based ligand design has led to the identification of compounds that are currently in clinical trials or into the market.19 The wealth of structural and functional information of CypA15 has offered a solid starting point for the rational structure-based design of inhibitors. By using docking-based virtual screening approach in conjunction with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) determination, 15 novel small molecule CypA binders (hits) (compounds 1\u201315) have been discovered. According to the binding potency, structural similarity, and synthetic complexity, seven hits (compounds 1\u20136 and 15) were selected as the starting points for further structural optimization. Totally, 40 new compounds including 1\u20136 and 15 (the preparation methods for these seven compounds have not been reported) and their 33 analogues (16a\u2013q, 17a\u2013d, and 18a\u2013l) have been synthesized and tested with biological assay. Finally, four compounds (16b, 16h, 16k, and 18g) were found to show high CypA PPIase (peptidyl-prolyl isomerase) inhibition activities and one compound (16h) is active in inhibiting the proliferation of spleen cells.",

Therefore, we determined their IC50 values, which are, respectively, 4.88, 2.84, 2.48, and 6.23 \u03bcM (Fig. 2\n). In addition, the binding affinities of the 33 analogues were determined by using the SPR technology, the results also listed in Table 1, Table 2. The PPIase activities of the compounds do not consistently correlate with the SPR binding affinities. The reason may be that the protein was immobilized to a sensor chip in the SPR assay, which affects the conformational flexibility of the protein. Accordingly, good binders identified by the SPR assay may not be good inhibitors. To find CypA inhibitors rather than binders, the effects of compounds on the PPIase activity of CypA have to be determined.",

From Figure 3, one can see that there are two binding sites in the surface binding groove of CypA: site A is a small binding pocket formed by Lys82, Met100, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Thr107, Asn108, Gly109, Ser110, Gln111, and Phe112; near site A, there is a larger pocket, which is called site B, formed by Phe60, Met61, Gln63, Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, Phe113, Leu122, and His126; there is a \u2018saddle\u2019 between the two sites. The binding models (Figs. 3a\u2013c) indicate that class I compounds (Table 1) interact with CypA in a similar way: the common sulfanilamide moiety occupies the polar binding site (site B), forming three to four hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) with residues Gln63, Gly75, Asn102, Thr107, Ser110, and Gln111 (Fig. 4\n); the 2-substituents of quinoline rings (1\u20134 and 16a\u2013j) and pyridine rings (16k\u2013q) or aryl rings (5, 6 and 17a\u2013d) fill in the hydrophobic pocket (site A); and the quinoline moiety (1\u20134 and 16a\u2013j), the pyridine moiety (16k\u2013q) or alkyl groups (5, 6 and 17a\u2013d) act as linkers interacting with the saddle part between sites A and B. The interacting models for class III compounds to CypA are mostly similar to those for class I compounds, except that compounds 15, 18a, 18d\u2013f, and 18j\u2013l extend from site B due to their longer linkers and/or substituents.",
