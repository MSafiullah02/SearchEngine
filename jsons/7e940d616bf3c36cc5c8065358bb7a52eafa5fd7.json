Search strategies used keywords for SARS ('SARS', 'severe acute respiratory syndrome', 'Coronavirus'), for West Nile Fever ('West Nile'); for bioterrorism ('anthrax', 'atomic', 'bioterrorism', 'bioterror', 'bio-terror', 'chemical warfare', 'dirty bombs', 'nuclear threat', 'plague and health', 'radiation' and 'smallpox'); for AIDS ('AIDS', 'HIV'); for smoking ('cigarettes', 'smoking and cigarettes', 'tobacco and health') and for physical inactivity ('exercise and fitness', 'physical activity', 'physical inactivity'). Each strategy was tested for accuracy by reviewing the content of at least 400 reports, randomly sampled from the results of two runs on two separate date ranges in the year 2003. For each search strategy, an adjustment factor was derived from the percentage of reports found relevant to the topic and was used to calculate an estimate of the number of media reports on each health hazard. Previous work has shown a high correlation between the number of press reports and their visual prominence in the media: topics that elicit great numbers of reports also get coverage with large, front page headlines (2) . We therefore used, in the present work, the number of reports on a health hazard as the sole indicator for the intensity of media coverage.",

The magnitude of a stimulus and its perceived significance derive from the contrast between that stimulus and other prior and simultaneous stimuli. The prospect theory extends the principle underlying these perceptual illusions to the explanation of cognitive biases in financial or health-related decisions. 3",

This bias acts first on journalists and editors, who sense emerging threats as 'newsworthy', then on general audiences, and finally on health professional and policy makers who follow the public agenda set by the mass media. Conversely, the more established the information about a health topic, the less likely it is to be perceived as worth coverage. The strongest evidence, typically obtained by a systematic review of repeated confirmatory observations, is less likely to be reported by the mass media 10 : novel but unproven technologies are promoted in the news media far more than established ones, in a pattern that may contribute to public demand for uncertain therapies, resulting in a spiraling increase in healthcare costs. Similarly, misrepresentation of health hazards in the press might lead to misplaced choices and distorted prioritisation.",

Chronic diseases caused by smoking and physical inactivity (such as lung and cardiac conditions, or obesity and diabetes) are probably associated with a higher burden of illness than acute infectious diseases (such as SARS or anthrax).
