            "text": "The current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was recently identified in patients with an acute respiratory syndrome, COVID-19. To compare its pathogenesis with that of previously emerging coronaviruses, we inoculated cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV and compared the pathology and virology with historical reports of SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in the absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and in ciliated epithelial cells of nasal, bronchial, and bronchiolar mucosae. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19-like disease in macaques, and provides a new model to test preventive and therapeutic strategies. swabs of aged animals compared with young animals. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in throat swabs peaked at day 1 p.i. in young and day 4 p.i. in aged animals and decreased more rapidly over time by comparison with the nasal swabs, but could still be detected intermittently up to day 10 p.i. (Fig. 1B) . Low levels of infectious virus were cultured from throat and nasal swabs up to day 2 and 4, respectively (Table S1 ). In support of virus shedding by these animals, environmental sampling was performed to determine potential contamination of surfaces. Environmental sampling indicated the presence of low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces through both direct contact (hands) and indirect contamination within the isolator (Table S2) . SARS-CoV-2 RNA was only detected in a rectal swab from one animal on day 14 p.i. and no viral RNA was detected in whole blood at any time point throughout the study.",

In these areas, the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with protein-rich edema fluid, fibrin, and cellular debris, alveolar macrophages, and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes ( Fig. 2C-E) . There was epithelial necrosis with extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls. Hyaline membranes were present in a few damaged alveoli. In areas with more advanced lesions, the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (type II pneumocyte hyperplasia), and the alveolar lumina were empty. Alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by edema fluid, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils. There were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels. Moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the bronchial walls, and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium. Regeneration of epithelium was seen in some bronchioles, visible as an irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. There were occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) free in the lumina of bronchioles and alveoli (Fig. 2F) , and, based on positive pankeratin staining and negative CD68 staining, these appeared to originate from epithelial cells (Fig. 2F, inset) .",

Recent studies in human cases have shown that presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases can also shed virus (14, 15) . Increased age did not affect disease outcome, but there was prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of aged animals. Prolonged shedding has been observed in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV patients (16, 17) . Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 shedding in our asymptomatic model, peaked early in the course of infection, similar to what is seen in symptomatic patients (16) . Also, SARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected in ciliated epithelial cells of nasal mucosae at day 4 p.i., which was not seen for SARS-CoV (10) or MERS-CoV infections (this manuscript) in this animal model. Viral tropism for the nasal mucosa fits with efficient respiratory transmission, as has been seen for influenza A virus (18) . This early peak in virus shedding for SARS-CoV-2 is similar to influenza virus shedding (19) and may explain why case detection and isolation may not be as effective for SARS-CoV-2 as it was for the control of SARS-CoV (20) . SARS-CoV-2 was primarily detected in tissues of the respiratory tract, however SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detectable in other tissues such as intestines, in line with a recent report (21) . Similar results regarding viral shedding and tissue and cell tropism were recently also reported following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation in rhesus macaques. However, unlike in our model, SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques does result in transient respiratory disease and weight loss (22, 23) .",

The colocalisation of SARS-CoV-2-antigen expression and DAD provides strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused this lesion. The histological character of the DAD, including alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, alveolar edema, hyaline membrane formation, and accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, corresponds with the limited pathological analyses of human COVID-19 cases (6, 7) . In particular, the presence of syncytia in the lung lesions is characteristic of respiratory coronavirus infections. Whereas MERS-CoV primarily infects type II pneumocytes in cynomolgus macaques, both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 also infect type I pneumocytes. Injury to type I pneumocytes can result in pulmonary edema, and formation of hyaline membranes (24) , which may explain why hyaline membrane formation is a hallmark for SARS and COVID-19 (7, 10), but not frequently reported for MERS (25, 26) .",

In this nonhuman primate model, SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract, including nasal cavity, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Replication in the upper respiratory tract fits with efficient transmission between hosts, while replication in the lower respiratory tract fits with the development of lung disease. An in-depth comparison of infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in this model may identify key pathways in the pathogenesis of these emerging viruses. This study provides a novel infection model which will be critical in the evaluation and licensure of preventive and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection for use in humans, as well as evaluating the efficacy of repurposing species specific existing treatments, such as pegylated interferon (12) .
