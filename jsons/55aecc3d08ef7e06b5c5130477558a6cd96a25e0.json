Here, we present methods for automating the image acquisition process for an automatic virus diagnostic application. The methods constitute a multi resolution approach where we first identify the grid squares and rate individual grid squares based on content in a grid overview image and then detect regions of interest in higher resolution images of good grid squares. Our methods are designed to mimic the actions of a virus TEM expert manually navigating the microscope and they are also compared to the expert's performance. Integrating the proposed methods with the microscope would reduce the search area by more than 99.99 % and it would also remove the need for an expert to perform the virus search by the microscope.",

In fact, virus taxonomy, to a large extent, still uses TEM to classify viruses based on their morphological appearance, as it has since it was first proposed in 1943 [3] . The use of TEM as a virus diagnostic tool in an infectious emergency situation was, for example, shown in both the SARS pandemic and the human monkey pox outbreak in the US 2003 [4, 5] . The viral pathogens were identified using TEM before any other method provided any results or information. It can provide an initial identification of the viral pathogen faster than the molecular diagnostic methods more commonly used today.",

The smoothing properties makes this method less noise sensitive compared to calculating derivatives with Prewitt or Sobel operators [11] . The Radon transform [12] , with parallel beams, is applied on the gradient magnitude image to create projections in angles from 0 to 180 degrees. In 2D the Radon transform integrates the gray-values along straight lines in the desired directions. The Radon space is hence a parameter space of the radial distance from the image center and angle between the image x-axis and the normal of the projection direction. To avoid the image proportions to bias the Radon transform only a circular disc in the center of the gradient magnitude image is used. Figure 2 (a) shows the Radon transform for the example overview image in Fig. 1(a) . A distinct pattern of local maxima can be seen at two different angles. These two angles correspond to the two main directions of the grid square edges. These two main directions can be separated from other angles by analyzing the variance of the integrated gray-values for the angles. Figure 2 (b) shows the variance in the Radon image for each angle. The two local maxima correspond to the angles of the main directions of the grid square borders. These angles can be even better identified by finding the two lowest minima in the second derivative, also shown in Fig. 2(b) . If there are several broken grid squares with edges in the same direction analyzing the second derivative of the variance is necessary. ",

Figure 3 (a) shows the Radon transform for one of the main directions. These functions are fairly periodic, corresponding to the repetitive pattern of grid square edges. The periodicity can be calculated using autocorrelation. The highest correlation occurs when the function is aligned with itself, the second highest peak in the correlation occurs when the function is shifted one period etc., see Fig. 3 (b). In Fig. 3 (c) the function is split into its periods and stacked (cumulatively summed). These summed periods have one high and one low plateau separated by two local maxima which we want to detect. By using Otsu's method for binary thresholding [13] these plateaux are detected. Thereafter, the two local maxima surrounding the low plateau are found. The high and low plateaux correspond to the inside and outside of the squares, respectively. Knowing the distance between the peaks (the length of the high plateau) and the period length the peak positions can be propagated in the Radon transform. This enables filling in missing lines, due to damaged grid square edges. The distance between the lines, representing the square edges, may vary a few units throughout the function, therefore, the peak positions are fine tuned by finding the local maxima in a small region around the peak position, shown as red circles and crosses in Fig. 3(a) . This step completes the grid square segmentation.",
