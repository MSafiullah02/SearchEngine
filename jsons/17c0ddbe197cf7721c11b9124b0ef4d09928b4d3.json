An emergency physician in Washington DC, Thomas Kirsch, asked on March 24, 2020, \"How much risk do healthcare workers have to take? Or, more bluntly: How many of us will die before we start to walk away from our jobs?\" (Kirsch, 2020) . Many healthcare workers stopped showing up at work once COVID-19 hit the US, due to the shortage of PPE (Cloherty, 2020) . Such issues can be more severe in less developed economies. For instance, media reported over 100 nurses stopped coming to work on one single day in a hospital in South America (Galdos, 2020) .",
