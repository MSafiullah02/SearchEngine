The mode of transmission in CAP is usually person-to-person, via water or mucus droplets laden with viruses or bacteria. The most frequent pathogens are gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) and Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae and atypical bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Viral forms commonly include those caused by respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, and corona viruses.

Healthy people are most likely to contract mycoplasma pneumonia or a mild form of pneumococcal pneumonia. Debilitated patients, alcoholics, and the chronically ill more often present with severe pneumococcal pneumonia or infections caused by H. influenzae, S. aureus, or gram-negative bacilli. L. pneumophila and Chlamydia infections are more common in patients with some form of mild immunologic compromise. Patients with poor oral hygiene and occasional loss of consciousness (epilepsy, alcoholism) may suffer from anaerobic pulmonary infections. In these patients, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections are more prevalent than in healthy individuals without risk factors. Recurrent pneumonia in outpatients usually indicates an underlying problem, such as congenital or acquired immunologic disorder; airway abnormalities, such as chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and bronchogenic carcinoma; cardiac conditions (congestive heart failure); or systemic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic alcoholism, and intravenous drug abuse. Up to 10% of CAPs are aspiration pneumonias caused by the aspiration of colonized oropharyngeal or gastric contents. The most frequently isolated pathogens in aspiration pneumonia are gram-negative bacteria. Aspiration pneumonia must be differentiated from aspiration pneumonitis, which is a chemical pneumonitis that results from the aspiration of noncolonized gastric contents (Mendelson's syndrome).",

Because the clinical symptoms are nonspecific, most people who have fever and cough do not have pneumonia; in fact, about 30% of patients, and especially the elderly, are afebrile at presentation. Imaging is one of the most important tools in the diagnosis of CAP. The radiographic identification of a new pulmonary infiltrate is, in the appropriate clinical setting, indicative of pneumonia. Conversely, a patient who has fever and cough but does not have radiologic proof of pneumonia cannot be considered to have pneumonia. In CAP, the causative organism is frequently not identified because noninvasive tests such as sputum cultures correctly identify the offending organism in only 50% of cases, and invasive procedures are rarely used in patients with pneumonia.",

A specific etiologic diagnosis, however, is difficult to establish, given the increasing spectrum of causative organisms and their overlapping radiographic features. In a prospective study of 359 adults with CAP, Fang and coauthors compared the radiographic, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with bacterial pneumonia (caused by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and aerobic gram-negative bacilli) and those with atypical pneumonia (caused by M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp.).

The abbreviation PCP is still used in some circles to refer to pneumocystis pneumonia.) In recent years the incidence of PJP as a presenting abnormality in patients with AIDS has decreased. Nevertheless it still accounts for a considerable amount of diseases in patients not on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or prophylactic therapy and should be considered as a diagnosis when characteristic radiographic findings are noted. Patients with PJP typically present with increasing shortness of breath; the disease may run a gradual or fulminant course. Chest films classically reveal a bilateral fine to medium reticulonodular pattern, generally bilateral but occasionally focal or unilateral. If the patient remains untreated, the radiograph progressively becomes more opaque and bilateral homogeneous opacities may ultimately be seen. While upper lobe involvement is more frequent, any lobe may be involved. On CT imaging PJP presents as ground-glass opacification in the areas of involvement, typically perihilar in distribution. The chest film occasionally may worsen within a few days of intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment secondary to overhydration and the production of pulmonary edema, but this can be treated quite effectively with diuretics.",

In this form, the chest film initially demonstrates a poorly marginated area or areas of homogeneous opacity that may resemble ordinary bacterial pneumonia in appearance and distribution but is occasionally rounder and farther from the subpleural lung than common community infections. In some cases, the disease is peripheral and wedge-shaped secondary to infarction caused by the angio-invasive obstruction of pulmonary vessels.

A ground glass opacity that surrounds (frequently incompletely) a more opaque center of the lesion results in the \"halo sign,\" in which the ground glass portion is an area of hemorrhage and the central area is necrotic lung. This sign was thought to be pathognomonic of invasive aspergillosis but it is also a feature of other infections, neoplasms, and inflammatory diseases.

The presence of an appropriate lung opacity on a chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia. Extensive knowledge of the radiographic appearances of pulmonary infections, their complications, and their course is essential in aiding the referring clinician and, ultimately, the patient. CT imaging is useful in patients with CAP and NP when there is a non-resolving or complicated chest film and at times in immunocompromised patients with suspected pulmonary infections. CT can help differentiate infectious from noninfectious abnormalities. CT may detect empyema, cavitation, and lymphadenopathy when chest films cannot. CT should be performed in immunocompromised patients with a clinical suspicion of pneumonia when the chest film is normal. This is especially true when the early diagnosis of pneumonia is critical, as is the case with immunocompromised and severely ill patients.",
