Careful planning is required, and guidelines have been published for anesthesiology teams2,3 to follow in such cases. Thus, airway management must be realized in an airborne isolation room (negative pressure). Airborne precautions, hand hygiene, and donning of personnel protective equipment including reinforced overshirt, double gloves, glasses, and filtering facepiece particles class 2 mask must be respected. It is also recommended that tracheal intubation is carried out under rapid sequence induction by an expert anesthesiologist using video laryngoscopy.2,4",

After testing two models with different sizes of portholes (12 and 15 cm), we opted for the larger one, providing adequate ability to perform intubation (using MacGrath in our institution) without movement difficulties (figs. 2 and 3). The space around the arms is minimal and offers the best benefit\u2013risk ratio, reducing the diffusion of aerosolized particles as much as possible compared with the absence of a protective device. In addition, the side porthole offers the possibility for a second operator to perform additional maneuvers, such as suction or the Sellick maneuverer (fig. 4). To harden the entire device, we used a rigid plastic board cut to the dimensions of the hood and fixed directly with screws on the existing screw holes. The manufacturing process was carried out with the help of a technical agent, in particular for the manufacture of the new base, with compatible equipment for hospital use (especially for hygiene). The entire process took less than an hour. The hood used was part of a defective incubator that was intended to be destroyed (obsolete equipment).",

Our device seems to be very easy and quick to use, confirmed when taking care of COVID-19 surgical patients.

All installations intended to remain in the operating room (including our device) are cleaned with a broad spectrum cleaner and disinfectant (Anios Oxy\u2019Floor in our hospital) after the exit of the COVID-19 patient from the operating room.
