OC43 and 229E, the \u201ccommon cold viruses\u201d, have been known since the 1960s [1], [2], [3], [4], and they have been found in 1.9% of children hospitalized for respiratory tract infection [5]. A more recently discovered coronavirus, NL63 [6], has been detected in 1.7\u20133.2% of respiratory tract samples of children hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) [5], [7], [8], [9], including acute laryngitis [5], [7], [9]. Another recently discovered human coronavirus, HKU1 [10], was detected in 2.95% of children hospitalized for upper or lower respiratory tract infections [11]. It seems that all of these HCoVs may cause respiratory tract infections in children that are severe enough to lead to hospitalization, but none of them seems to be more pathogenic than any other [12].",

Therefore, none of the four coronaviruses could be specifically associated with AGE. Moreover, when HCoV was found in stools, it was almost always found concomitantly in the nasal swab too. These findings could mean that the detection in stools reflects the presence of HCoV in the respiratory tract and the virus detected in stools may only be there as the result of being swallowed. In the present study, in almost all cases of HCoV detection in both stool and nasal swab samples, the nasal swab samples were positive in the first PCR step. This suggests a relatively large quantity of viruses in the respiratory tract, compared to cases with a positive nasal swab sample only; in these cases, over half of the samples were positive only in the second PCR step. This could mean that higher virus load in the respiratory tract results in the presence of the virus in the stool either due to swallowing or by other mechanism. In most of the HCoV-positive stool samples, only the second PCR step was positive, indicating a relatively small quantity of viruses.",

HCoV findings in stools are more likely to be derived from respiratory infection, and the gastroenteritis symptoms can be explained by the well-known gastroenteritis viruses found in the same stool samples.
