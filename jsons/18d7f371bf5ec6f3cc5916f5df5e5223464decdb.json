            "text": "Dear Sir, Since December 2019, a new virus of the coronavirus family, named SARS-COV-2, has spread throughout the world, being classified as \"pandemic\" and generating the so-called COVID-19. Mortality for subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is about 50% [1] . A comparison of the case-fatality rate between Italy and China, suggests that male patients aged \u226570 years are at higher risk [2] . As previously reported, subjects affected by metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) or respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or hypertension and coronary artery disease respectively, develop more severe illness [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Obesity seems the natural link between these conditions, but its prevalence in COVID-19 patients is unknown. Bhatraju et al. [1] reported that, among COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU, the mean BMI was 33.2\u00b17.2 kg/m 2 . This is in line with evidence that obesity facilitates the infection from influenza virus [8] and it should be considered a negative prognostic factor among COVID-19 patients, as documented by a recent meta-analysis in which severe COVID-19 patients showed higher BMI compared with nonsevere patients [9] . Thus, countries with higher prevalence of obesity are expected to have higher incidence of COVID-19 and complications.",

Of them, 48% had hypertension, 13% had T2D, and 16% had COPD. Mean age was 64 \u00b1 16 years. In a multivariate logistic regression model including age, sex, T2D, hypertension, COPD, only age and gender (male) were predictors of higher mortality, but obesity was not an independent predictor of higher mortality. However, obesity was able to predict a longer length of hospital stay, indicating that obesity may lead to higher morbidity during hospitalization.",
