Connections between the domains of resilience and risk assessment include vulnerability. Infrastructure, social, economic and ecological systems (and combined social-ecological systems) are vulnerable to exogenous global change, and other disturbances, both natural and anthropologically derived. Here, resilience analysis fundamentally seeks to provide the groundwork for a \u2018soft landing\u2019, or an efficient and robust restoration following disturbance as well as the ability to reduce harms while helping the targeted system rebound to full functionality as quickly and efficiently where possible. Such applications are consistent with The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) definition of resilience, which more broadly denotes the field as \u201cthe ability to plan and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events\u201d (Larkin et al. 2015).",

Specifically, the actions of such stakeholders may mitigate or exacerbate such disruptions based upon the public\u2019s awareness of the challenge and to its relevant response strategies, which find expression in (i) the resources and readiness committed to promoting resilience for a given system and community, (ii) the priorities defined and the risks evaluated and (iii) the efforts at crafting effective involvement and risk communication to align community actions, reactive or preventive. Based upon the system and community in question, such stakeholders may range from the communities at large to local, regional, and national as well as policymakers and decision makers, where specific focus must be levied upon engaging the correct and relevant stakeholders to prepare for and recover from adverse events. In this way, stakeholder engagement is an essential element of promoting social resilience in response to various adverse events and system stresses, and serves as a key task in aligning incentives and unifying members of government, industry, and the lay public to address potential or ongoing challenges that may otherwise generate lasting harms to given communities.",

In this respect, the Working Group discussed social resilience as comprising both \u2018resilient societies\u2019 as well as \u2018the actions and involvement of key social groups to improve resilience of systems from engineering applications\u2019. As such, this chapter begins with a general review of social resilience and resilient societies, and then reviews how social mechanisms such as stakeholder engagement are critical to promote system resilience for ecological or infrastructural applications.",

Typically referred to as \u2018one-off events\u2019, or in situations of high uncertainty and surprise \u2018black swans\u2019, shocks are characterized by the relatively rapid manner in which they appear and subside (although their resulting impact can cause long-lasting damage).

Rather than overwhelm existing infrastructural and systemic resources within a brief period, such stresses act slowly to reduce such system\u2019s efficiencies and abilities to perform at a high level. Examples here include challenges from climate change, which can hinder agricultural output and community wellbeing over time without proper protections and countermeasures. Other examples may include the effect of mass migration upon society, where gradual effects can stress infrastructural systems in the absence of a plan to accommodate a large influx of people. While stresses generally may not possess dramatic adverse effects within a short period, the consequences of such gradual effects may be equally challenging to societal resilience and the ability of respective communities to absorb and recover from potential threats and problems over time.",

Within the concept of panarchy, a systemic shock or stress may generate cascading effects and feedback loops that overwhelm system capacities to absorb and recover from adverse events. Panarchy serves as a framework for a complex series of interaction effects that, without a contextually rich and thorough understanding of how a given system interacts and operates with other infrastructural and societal elements, can greatly exacerbate the damages wrought by shocks and stresses over time.

For the former, the system seeks to preserve itself by adapting to adverse events and recovering to near or total efficiency over a period of time (Walker et al. 2004; Briske et al. 2010). Further, such systems are considered resilient to a varying degree to those particular shocks or stresses (predictable or unpredictable), where they possess the ability to weather such challenges without completely collapsing and inducing permanent damage to social function. While often discussed as being an inherently positive trait within published literature, this is not necessarily always true, where a resilient system may be harmful or a reinforcing social trap in nature (Palma-Oliveira and Trump 2016).",

In turn, this requires, based on the magnitude of damage caused by the disruption: (i) the existence of precise plan of recovery, (ii) pre-defined responsibilities, and (iii) sets of relevant operational actions to ensure control and reduction of damages. In each of these considerations, there exists a clear need for systems analysis techniques in various planning and construction phases to tackle aforementioned problems (Moy et al. 1986). For instance, systems analysis may help to simulate possible hydrologic conditions and various operational scenarios to control water flows into and from reservoirs (McMahon et al. 2006). With such analysis, social impacts may be weighted to be of high importance, including consideration of time intervals to determine shifting social priorities and/or infrastructural functions to meet the demands of local economic, health, and social needs (Srdjevic and Srdjevic 2016).",

An equally important consideration includes how individuals and groups will behave and interpret information during and after such a shock. Such considerations may include public awareness and risk communication drives, the allocation of financial and physical resources to be activated before and in the event of an emergency, and well-established and distributed safety guidelines and best practices, among others. With such preparation, local and national governments may be able to limit the negative social impacts that inevitably arise from consequential shocks to energy, medical, environmental, or economic infrastructure, and may help reduce recovery time in the aftermath of the event in question.",

Currently, such methods and regulatory approaches are limited in scope (Linkov et al. 2015). Similarly, Larkin et al. (2015) noted that as of 2015, few methodological approaches of resilience analysis were formally used to facilitate risk assessment within United States government agencies. However, Larkin et al. (2015) did state that many agencies have begun experimenting with prototypical resilience models for local and regional governments and communities, where such methods may become more standardized and mandatory as their use is proven beneficial for bolstering various elements of social and infrastructural resilience.",
