Haematological changes suggestive of sepsis occurred in 83% and positive bacteriological cultures were found in 38%, the most common organism isolated being Clostridium perfringens. Complications included intestinal perforation in six patients and recurrence of NEC in five, of whom one subsequently developed an intestinal stricture. Five of the eight nursery deaths were secondary to peritonitis and overwhelming sepsis from NEC. In spite of the discontinuation of milk feeds for prolonged periods, satisfactory caloric intake and weight gain were achieved with parenteral nutrition in the survivors. Of the 41 long-term survivors, six (1 5%) were found to have a disability at 2 years of age, corrected for prematurity, compared with 48 (20%) of 241 very low birthweight survivors from the same study period who did not have NEC. None had evidence of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Six (1 5%) children remained below the 10th percentile for both weight and height. This study showed that early diagnosis and therapy for NEC in very low birthweight infants were associated with a favourable short-and long-term outcome.",

Patients who manifested these clinical features were classified according to their abdominal x rays into mild or severe NEC. X-ray findings in the mild cases included gaseous distension, asymmetry of gas pattern, suggestion of thickened bowel wall and intramural gas in the form of a granular or foamy pattern. Severe cases were defined as those who showed on x ray a curvilinear intramural gas pattern, pneumoperitoneum or hepatic portal venous gas. All patients were diagnosed unanimously by the consultants as having NEC. Abnormal haematological findings and positive bacteriological cultures were used to differentiate between patients with mild NEC and infants with transient abdominal distension and milk intolerance with non-specific x-ray signs. Perinatal data were coded prospectively by a research sister (B.B.) and were checked by paediatricians (V.Y.H.Y. and R.J.) before card punching.

At their 2-year assessment, there were two children with cerebral palsy (spastic quadriplegia and diplegia respectively) and two children with MDI scores of 59 and 63 respectively. In addition, one child had spastic quadriplegia and a MDI of below 50. The remaining child with a disability was physically and developmentally normal but had epilepsy. The mean score for the MDI was 89 (s.d. = 20) and that for the PDI was 86 (s.d. = 15) which approximate closely the figures reported in the test manual (mean = 100, s.d. = 16). Of the 50 VLBW infants with NEC in this series, nine (1 8%) died, six (12%) survived with a disability and 35 (70%) were considered to be normal. In comparison, of the 325 remaining VLBW infants who did not develop NEC, 84 (26%) died, 48 (1 5%) survived with a disability and 193 (59%) were considered to be normal. At 2 years post-term, six (1 5%) children remained below the tenth percentile for both weight and height although their head circumference distribution was normal (Table 3) . None had evidence of recurrent diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal dysfunction.",

For this reason, we commenced treatment in infants with early or mild disease, which involved 5-7 days of parenteral antibiotics and a concomittant period of parenteral nutrition via peripheral veins. In spite of this approach towards early diagnosis, our 14% overall incidence of NEC in VLBW infants was only slightly higher than the 8-1O% incidence of NEC reported in other centres for the same birthweight ~a t e g o r y .~. '~.~~ This difference could probably be explained by the higher overall survival rate of VLBW infants in the present series compared with previous reports, as this would increase the proportion of VLBW infants who previously would have died before they had a chance to develop NEC. Our approach of early diagnosis and intervention may have contributed to our low 5% incidence of severe NEC which manifested the more specific x-ray signs.",

As 83% of the patients had haematological evidence of sepsis, infection appeared to play a central role in the pathogenesis of NEC. It has been proposed that bacterial growth may be enhanced by milk feeding, the intestinal mucosa may be compromised by hypoxia-ischaemia and may permit secondary bacterial invasion, and the nature of the bacteria in a specific environment may provide the appropriate setting for direct infection.25 The most interesting bacteria implicated as primary pathogens for the development of NEC are the clostridia organisms.26 These are obligate anaerobes which inhabit the intestinal tract and have a propensity to invade ischaemic and devitalized tissue and produce gas and virulent toxins. Clostridium was found in five patients and was the most common bacterial isolate in this series. Two of the five patients died and both had portal venous gas in their x rays.",
