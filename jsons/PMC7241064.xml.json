            "text": "MS is characterized by acute-onset neurological symptoms (relapses), and chronic disability, which are primarily evaluated on neurological examination [4]. Following the COVID-19 emergency, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has published recommendations for implementing a tele-medicine service, suggesting that general neurological examination is feasible remotely, but with some caveats [5]. For instance, there are difficulties in comprehensive examination of eyes (i.e., fundoscopy), neuro-muscolar components (i.e., reflexes), and vestibular system (i.e., Dix-Hallpike maneuver), while the evaluation of other neurological systems depends on the tele-neurology setup (i.e., space enough for gait examination), and the availability of a caregiver to help (i.e., sensory examination) [5]. Remote examination could be further implemented with the use of digital technology, such as smartphone accelerometers for gait, posture, and balance assessment [6]. Similarly, over the past years, different studies have already explored the feasibility of remote counseling in MS, but have focused on specific aspects of the disease (e.g., treatment adherence, mental health) [7\u20139]. As such, there is no general agreement on MS-specific neurological examination on tele-consultations. Hereby, we have briefly reviewed available tools for remote evaluation of disability progression and relapses in MS, and have suggested a battery for tele-neurology examination in MS.",

The possibility of assessing the EDSS remotely has been explored, but would require to use an \u201cin-home neuro kit\u201d with vision card, tuning fork, pin, cotton swab, and alcohol swab [10], to have a caregiver helping with the examination [9, 10], and to combine records from wearable devices (e.g., accelerometer-based step counts) [7, 9]. As such, remote EDSS faces some organizational issues, which would be difficult to overcome in the short term, but could be considered when strictly required (e.g., patients included in research protocols). Also, data from wearable devices should be interpreted cautiously, considering that the occurrence of new or recurrent neurological symptoms may not necessarily correspond to reduced physical activity in patients already self-isolating at home.",

The Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) has been specifically developed as a PROM of MS disability and has been validated in multiple languages, and also for online administration [11]. The PDDS is strongly correlated to EDSS, and especially to visual, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder, and ambulatory functional systems, leaving brainstem and cerebral functions relatively unexplored [12]. As such, if patients are required to fill in the PDDS before tele-consultations, remote examination could specifically focus on brainstem function (e.g., ocular movements, trigeminal damage, hearing loss, dysarthria, and dysphagia), which is possibly easier to examine remotely or, at least, on history taking. Looking at cerebral function, different neuropsychological tests have been assessed for remote use [13]. Among them, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), which measures attention and processing speed, holds strong correlates to disability progression, and has been suggested as a screening tool for cognitive impairment in MS [14]. The oral version of the SDMT has already been validated for remote use (e.g., online or during functional-MRI acquisitions), is ideally suitable for all languages [14], and, thus, could be easily used on tele-neurology.",

Thus, if some elements are relatively easy to evaluate on remote history taking (e.g., timeline, concomitant fever or symptoms of infection), neurological abnormalities would need to be detected as suggested above, along with other neurological tests in relation to reported symptoms. However, relapses also affect quality of life and activities of daily living [15], and, thus, the inclusion of MS-specific PROMs measuring physical and psychological health could support the assessment of relapse severity. For instance, the MS Impact Scale (MSIS-29) has been used in clinical trials to evaluate recovery from relapses [15], and has been tested for remote administration [16]. Alternative scales could be considered depending on prevalent patients\u2019 symptoms (e.g., mood, fatigue). However, in-person examination and/or MRI should be considered for cases where a relapse cannot be fully ruled out, in order to make timely treatment decisions [4].",

Then, during the tele-consultation, neurologists can focus on history taking and examination of brainstem function and other neurological systems, as required by patients\u2019 symptoms. Finally, if necessary, the examiner could administer the oral version of the SDMT by showing the test form on patients\u2019 screen. Alternatively, patients could be provided with PDDS, MSIS-29, and an electronic version of the SDMT [17], for self-assessment, and, then, request tele-neurology if necessary. The PDDS, the MSIS-29, and the SDMT could be integrated to video-consultation platforms or electronic health record systems, or be implemented using other online tools, such as Google Forms.",
