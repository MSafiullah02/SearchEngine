As shown in the figure, interactions between users and news have popularity pattern, meaning that users mostly prefer popular news. For instance, the top-7 most popular articles account for 80% of total consumptions during the entire time. Figure 1b shows a freshness pattern in Adressa dataset, where the number of consumptions of each news rapidly decreases over its age. This indicates that customers prefer relatively fresh news since the novelty of news expires quickly over time. Thus, the challenge of designing an accurate news recommender systems is to consider the global temporal preference while taking into account each user's personal preference.",

PGT gives a recommendation for each user at time t leveraging 1) the global temporal preference at time t, and 2) watch-history of the user before t. 1 . Global temporal preference. Representing global temporal preference at time t as a low-rank latent vector is challenging since it has to involve both of popularity pattern and freshness pattern at that time. To deal with this challenge, PGT selects 1) document vectors of the most popular n articles at time t, which stand for popularity pattern, and 2) document vectors of the most fresh m articles at time t, which stand for freshness pattern. These vectors for the two different patterns are combined by the self-attention [15] with a scaled dot product (details in Sect. 3.2). 2. Watch history. A user's previous watch history epitomizes the user's personal preference. The goal of PGT is to extract a sequential pattern in the watch history with regard to the global temporal preference. For the purpose, PGT uses a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) which has shown the best performance in encoding session-based sequential data [5] where a session is a set of consecutive behaviors of a user. PGT combines the hidden states of BiLSTM by an attention network using the global temporal preference as context (details in Sect. 3.3).",

To deal with the cold-start problems, several studies enrich the embedding of newly published articles by utilizing the meta-information of articles [4] . Okura et al. [11] proposed a news recommender system based on variational autoencoder (VAE) and RNN. They used a method based on VAE to learn embedding vectors of articles, such that vectors in the same categories are made similar. After learning article embeddings, they used RNNs to predict the next article vector that a user is likely to watch. Park et al. [12] proposed a news recommendation system based on RNN to model each user's personal preference. They reranked the candidates by each user's long-term categorical preference which is the weighted sum of categories of news articles that the user has seen; this categorical preference improved the accuracy.",

We use the hyperbolic tangent as a non-linear activation function, but omits it for the last MLP since it gives the best accuracy. For the competitors, we follow their best settings. We use mini-batched inputs of size 512 to feed models during training. When the validation loss keeps increasing for 10 epochs, we early stop training to prevent overfitting. All methods in our experiments early stopped before 200 epochs of training. Table 2 shows accuracies of PGT and competitors; Weave&Rec and NPA, which require news contents, are not evaluated for Globo since it does not provide news contents. Note that PGT gives the highest accuracy compared to the competitors. We have the following observations from the results. First, even though POP recommends news articles based only on the general popularity, the popularity pattern of news data (shown in Fig. 1 ) makes POP a strong baseline showing a good performance. Meanwhile, the performances of the other competitors (Park et al. [12] , Okura et al. [11] , HRAM, Weave&Rec, and NPA) are less accurate especially in Adressa. It is because they consider only personal preference while users' behaviors in Adressa are more skewed toward the popularity pattern. Note that HR@5 of POP is the probability of watching one of the top 5 most popular articles. HR@5 of POP in Adressa 10W, Adressa 1W, and Globo are 0.5672, 0.4988, and 0.2845, respectively; this shows that users' interactions in Adressa are more skewed to popular articles which are more related to global temporal preference rather than personal preference. On the other hand, our proposed PGT shows the best performance even on Adressa compared to the other competitors by appropriately attending to personal and global temporal preferences. Second, the methods modeling each user's watch history by utilizing attention network (PGT, HRAM, and NPA) are more accurate compared to the other competitors (Park et al. [12] , Okura et al. [11] , and Weave&Rec). The attention network dynamically attends to important previous behaviors, and thus increases recommendation accuracy. Meanwhile, due to the property of RNN, inference in RNN-based methods (Park et al. [12] and Okura et al. [11] ) often neglects users' long-term behaviors. Weave&Rec captures a temporal pattern of each user's watch history using 3-dimensional CNN, but provides poor recommendations to fresh users because of their insufficient watch histories.",

In Table 2 , we compare the performances of PGT and other neural network based methods on Adressa 1W and Adressa 10W to show how well the global temporal preference helps preserve the accuracy from the cold-start problem, since the other methods neglect the global temporal preference. Note that all neural network based methods suffer from the cold-start problem more severely on Adressa 10W since the time gap between the train and the test set is the longest in it. MRR@20s of Park et al. [12] , Okura et al. [11] , Weave&Rec, HRAM, and NPA decrease by 26.78%, 30.56%, 30.29%, 26.89%, and 21.42%, respectively, on Adressa 10W compared to those on Adressa 1W; on the other hand, MRR@20 of PGT decreases only by 9.12% on the same setting. This shows that PGT better handles the cold-start problem.",

Based on the observation, we introduce the concept of global temporal preference to news recommender system, to provide suitable recommendation results based on time. We also propose an attention based architecture to effectively deal with changes of users' personal preferences, with regard to the global temporal preference. Extensive experiments show that PGT provides the most accurate news recommendation, by considering both of personal and global temporal preferences.
