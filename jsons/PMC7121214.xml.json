Later on, it has been related to cytokines\u2019 action on vascular permeability and identified also as vascular leak syndrome (VLS) [2]. In its acute phase (leak phase), up to 70 % of plasma is extravasated. Prodromic signs such as malaise, weight gain, fatigue, weakness and myalgia may occur; pyrexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting may follow. The Leak phase is characterized by prolonged hypotension, edema (face, trunk, extremities) hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia, oliguria, thirst, and cool skin. Complications such as ischemia, renal failure, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and rhabdomyolysis may also occur at this stage.",

Endothelial injury and apoptosis or cell retraction have been suggested on the basis of morphological and functional studies, although not conclusive. The vascular damage may involve activation of endothelial cells and leukocytes, intercellular adhesion, and most importantly the massive release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Their effect greatly increases vascular permeability allowing fluids, proteins, and electrolytes to flow into interstitial spaces, producing edema, hypoxia, and multiple organ failures (mainly pulmonary, cardiac, and renal). Therefore, multifactorial mechanisms have been postulated as: (1) initial toxic effects on vascular endothelium integrity; (2) activation of endothelial cells and leukocytes; (3) additional secretion of cytokines and inflammatory mediators consequent to cell activation; (4) increased damage by activated leukocytes and secondary reaction of newly formed mediators [3\u20135].",

In the case of alemtuzumab, in vitro testing showed that CRS is IgG isotype dependent and that IgG1\u2014the most used isotype in mAbs production\u2014induces the highest levels of cytokine release. Pyrexia and hyperthermia are mostly related to IL-1, IL-6, and TNF production. In particular, hyperthermia seems to be more related to IL-6 release, but independent from PGE2 production, e.g., from the usual inducer pathway of pyrexia [16].

However, in the case of the trifunctional antibody catumaxomab, this activity was only observed in significant amounts when the antibody was incubated in vitro with blood cells in the presence of the target (EpCAM positive colon tumor cells) [18]. Therefore, intercellular binding and/or additional releases of other CRS\u2013inducing factors from tumor cells might play additional roles in CRS manifestation, particularly when a high burden of specific tumor targets are involved. Major effects were seen in releasing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the presence of EpCAM-positive tumor cells, with a smaller activity on IL-2 and a nonsignificant action on IL-12 and IL-1. In this case, no histamine release or complement activation was observed during experiments, thus indicating the exclusive role of cytokines in the development of typical CRS. Altogether, the in vitro cytokine release stimulation on effector cells and the protective effect exerted by some corticosteroids in the same in vitro assay are a further proof-of-concept of mAb-mediated CRS pathogenesis and of the efficacy of steroid (pre) medication in mitigating its effects in vivo.",

The etiology of noninfectious forms is unknown. Genetic defects in T and NK cells cytotoxicity, the latter related to perforin deficiency encountered especially in SJIA, have been identified. High levels of macrophage stimulating (M-CSF, IFN\u03b3, and MCP-1), or macrophage-derived (IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF\u03b1) cytokines, and of T-derived products (IL-2 and IL-2R) are usually present, while IL-1 is not always elevated, although its role in developing the syndrome is revealed by beneficial effects of IL-1 antagonist, such as anakinra. However, a number of iatrogenic inducers/boosters have been suspected, such as acetylsalicylic acid and other NSAIDs, gold salts, sulfasalazine, and biomedicines with high capacity of cytokine release, including TNF-\u03b1 releasers. Interestingly, the latter seems to play an additional role in dyscoagulative disorders [28\u201331]. Cases of MAS or exacerbation of underlying states of HPS, including cytopathic histiocytic panniculitis (CHP) have been reported after treatment with etanercept, rilonacept, tocilizumab, anakinra, and alemtuzumab [32, 33]. However, a direct relation between treatment and MAS induction is not always evident. For example, in cases where MAS was associated to alemtuzumab a reactivation of EBV and CMV viruses occurred, thus indicating a possible immunosuppressive effect of the biomedicine as an indirect cause of MAS activation. In other clinical situations, such as after anakinra treatment, the agents seemed to ameliorate MAS, but in other occasions they acted as inducers of macrophage activation. In one case of CHP evolving into a severe HLH with elevated circulating IFN\u03b3, IL-12, IL-4, and IL-18, but also of the antiinflammatory IL-10, etanercept was partially effective, yet produced aphasia and hemiparalysis that resolved after treatment discontinuation [34]. The subsequent treatment with anakinra was very effective in controlling the syndrome. Such biomedicine was equally effective in Still\u2019s disease and SJIA, but in other cases of JIA failed or led to induction of MAS [35\u201337]. It must be stated that anecdotal reported cases of similar conditions are difficult to compare per se. Observations during controlled studies are rare and often refer to different clinical situations.",
