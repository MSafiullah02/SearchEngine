Given the prevalence and magnitude of physical impairments after critical illness, many survivors, including those recovering from COVID-19, could benefit from physical therapist services after hospital discharge. However, due to the relatively recent recognition and characterization of PICS, there may be limited awareness and understanding of PICS among physical therapists practicing in home healthcare and community-based settings. This lack of awareness may lead to inappropriate and/or inadequate rehabilitation service provision. While this perspective article provides information relevant to all physical therapists, it is aimed toward those providing rehabilitation services outside of the acute and post-acute inpatient settings. This article reports the prevalence and clinical presentation of PICS and provides recommendations for physical examination and outcomes measures, plan of care, and intervention strategies.",

PICS was defined as \"new or worsening impairments in physical, cognitive, or mental health status arising after critical illness and persisting beyond acute care hospitalization.\" 2 PICS is not a diagnosis, but rather this term was created to increase awareness of post-ICU impairments prompt screening for specific impairments, and stimulate research into specific morbidities following intensive care. PICS can also affect family members, known as PICS-F. 2 (Tab. 1) By raising awareness, the goal of creating the PICS term was to stimulate screening/diagnosis and treatment for specific impairments that were commonly occurring, but often unrecognized, after critical illness.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] In a multi-site prospective study, one-third of survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had significant limb muscle weakness at hospital discharge, with most survivors demonstrating improvement over the first 12 months of follow-up. 11 This muscle weakness was associated with substantial impairments in survivors' physical functioning and quality of life, with the duration of bed rest in the ICU being independently associated with relative decreases in muscle strength throughout the 24-month followup period. 11 The presentation of weakness is variable, as is the effect on physical functioning. Some people with PICS may require total assistance for functioning while others may demonstrate grossly independent ADL but have limitations with stair climbing.",

For instance, in one multi-site study, among people surviving for at least two years after ARDS, 80% had at least one inpatient admission to a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility, or re-admission to acute care hospital during the 2-year follow up. 20 Of those readmitted to hospital, one-third of readmissions occurred within one month of hospital discharge. 20 Along with inpatient healthcare utilization, survivors of critical illness also frequently require on-going outpatient medical and rehabilitation healthcare services. 21 The influence of PICS and ongoing healthcare utilization can impact joblessness and associated lost earnings. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that jobless rates, among those previously employed before critical illness, are approximately 67%, 40%, and 33% at up to 3, 12, and 60 months after hospital discharge. 22 Those who do return to work often experience ongoing challenges, including subsequent job loss, change in occupation, or decreased work hours. 23 Results of these assessments will inform the physical therapist regarding pulmonary function impairment and may inform regarding potential benefit of respiratory muscle training and other pulmonary rehabilitation interventions.",

In addition to interventions teaching the person new strategies, caregivers will benefit from learning techniques for assisting in the presence of new and evolving functional limitations. Compensatory interventions may include recommending and instructing in the use of assistive devices (eg, use of a cane or walker), adaptive devices that assist the performance of activities of daily living (eg, raised toilet seat), and instruction in strategies that promote participation in the community (eg, use of accessible parking spaces). Patient and family education should address the recovery process that accompanies PICS, the benefits from accessing physical and emotional support, coping strategies for the prolonged recovery, and strategies for prioritizing activity and participation in the presence of fatigue or reduced stamina. 81 The elevated risk of hospital readmission associated with a decline in functional status 82 establishes the paramount challenge to the physical therapist managing the person with PICS. Therefore, exercises that promote functioning should predominate early in the course of recovery.

An optimal outcome will require customized exercise interventions with intensity titrated to achieve overload. Aerobic exercise intensity should be at 50 to 70% of heart rate reserve and a Borg Breathlessness score of 3 to 4. 84 Strength training should provide resistance at 70% to 80% of the person's 1 repetition maximum. 85 In addition to informing exercise intensity, routine measurement of cardiac and respiratory responses are necessary due to the risk for decompensation in response to exercise. In summary, anticipation of a dose-dependent response to exercise and titration of exercise interventions to achieve overload while balancing the physiological demand is essential.",

Reduced quality of life is greatest in the first year after the critical illness, and after several years it may trend towards ordinary levels. 63Screening for Cognitive and Mental Health ImpairmentsCognitive impairment, and depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms are common among people with PICS (Tab. 3). 64 The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is effective for identifying mild cognitive impairments; 65 however, its validity for survivors of critical illness needs further examination. 64,66 To screen for depression and anxiety, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 67 is recommended for survivors of critical illness. 17,19,64 Common symptoms of depression that may overlap with physical impairments (such as fatigue or difficulty sleeping) have been removed from this instrument. Physical therapists may be familiar with screening for depression with the questions \"During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?\" and \"During the past month, have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?\" 68 However, those questions have not been validated for use for people experiencing PICS. To screen for PTSD in survivors of critical illness, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) is recommended, 64,69 A score \u22651.6 indicates positive screening for clinically important symptoms. 69 Cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and PTSD negatively impact engagement in physical therapy and physical performance; 70 therefore, identification and referral to a mental health specialist is an important consideration. Evaluation Examination data obtained using robust outcome measures is key to developing and monitoring the efficacy of a plan of care. Several strategies increase the utility of the examination. Comparing a person's score on the outcome measure with baseline scores allows for tracking over time to determine the progress (or lack of progress) as well as the impact of the physical therapist's intervention. Normative values are available for some outcome measures. Comparison of the person's outcome data with norms for the general population allows the physical therapist to determine the person's relative performance for impairment and activity limitation outcome measures. The person's performance, as a percentage of normal values, also can be tracked over time to document response to interventions and may provide a metric that is easily understandable to a survivor of critical illness.",

            "text": "and commonly accompanied by cognitive and mental health problems, level of coordination of services with other health care providers is necessary to achieve optimal outcomes. Due to the evolving understanding of PICS, coupled with limited education about PICS for primary providers,94 it may be necessary for physical therapists to become the driver for informing the members of the healthcare team about PICS. The physical therapist may need to educate the person's primary care provider and others about the breadth of physical, cognitive, and mental health problems that the person may experience due to PICS. A goal of facilitating the coordination of services is to reduce the hospital readmission rates and greater resource utilization that has been associated with PICS. 24Future DirectionsWith the aging population and improving ICU mortality, the number of survivors of critical illness is growing. The PICS term was introduced relatively recently and ongoing efforts are needed to continue to raise awareness among ICU and post-ICU clinicians, patients, and families regarding problems that commonly occur in survivors of critical illness. Importantly PICS emphasizes the coincident problems that may occur within physical, cognitive, and mental health status of survivors of critical illness. Greater research is needed to understand underlying mechanisms for these problems and to design and evaluate novel interventions to prevent or treat specific impairments commonly experienced by survivors of critical illness. Given the common occurrence of problems across these distinct domains, interventions may need to target any common underlying mechanisms and include multi-component interventions. Considerations for future research in this field includes: (1) focusing on patient-important outcomes, with appropriate outcomes measures that are reliable and valid in this specific population, including conducting new psychometric evaluation of existing instruments and rigorously creating new instruments if needed,64,95 (2) following survivors longitudinally, throughout the trajectory of recovery, with rigorous, evidence-based methods for retaining participants in these long-term studies,96 and (3) use of appropriate statistical methods to appropriately address the impact of high mortality on outcome assessment and interpretation of the efficacy of interventions. 97 Through NIHfunded research infrastructure, free resources are available at www.improveLTO.com to address each of these three issues. Further research infrastructure and novel research studies are needed, including digital healthcare, and studies with a focus on interprofessional collaboration among physical therapists, other rehabilitation specialists, critical care physicians and nurses, and neuropsychological experts. Conclusions The success of critical care services has resulted in increasing numbers of critical care survivors, with many experiencing PICS. Home healthcare and outpatient physical therapists are ideally positioned to address the reduced functioning and participation associated with PICS. Optimal management begins with the recognition of PICS. We propose that a history of critical illness is a \"yellow flag\" to recognize an elevated risk for associated physical, cognitive, or mental health impairments. Outcome measures that demonstrate the impact of impairments should be included in the initial examination and in longitudinal follow-up to help understand the pathway of recovery experienced by the person. In anticipation of a prolonged recovery period, early interventions based on may prove beneficial. The interconnected nature of the problems associated with PICS often requires collaboration within an interprofessional team to tailor the clinical services to the unique needs and abilities of each person and optimize patient and family outcomes.
