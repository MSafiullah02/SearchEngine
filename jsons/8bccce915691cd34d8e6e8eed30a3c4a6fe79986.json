While infectious diseases can never be completely prevented, measures can be introduced to restrict the entry of pathogens into a population or limit the implications of the presence of a pathogen. Objective research regarding infection control and biosecurity in horses is limited, yet a variety of practical infection prevention and control measures can be used. Unfortunately, infection control can be challenging, because of the nature of the equine industry (e.g. frequent horse movement) and endemic pathogens, but also because of lack of understanding or motivation to try to improve practices.

While some consider 'infection control' and 'biosecurity' to be equivalent terms, there are important differences. There are various definitions of biosecurity, and it can be broadly defined as measures to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission. More often, it is used to refer to measures used to prevent the entry of pathogens into a population. In contrast, infection control aims to limit the impact of the introduction of pathogens into a population. For example, intensive biosecurity practices are widely used in poultry production, with measures such as all-in/all-out production, tight personnel access controls and prevention of wildlife exposure, all designed to minimise the chance that various pathogens enter the farm. At the other end of the spectrum is infection control in a veterinary hospital, where infectious animals are willingly admitted but measures are in place to limit the risk of transmission. While equine farms cover a wide spectrum, very few can practice true biosecurity because of the regularity of horse movement, cross-movement of personnel, the endemic nature of many pathogens and the commonness of latent infections (e.g. EHV-1). That does not mean that facilities should not strive to prevent entrance of pathogens.

The potential for eradication of strangles has been discussed [43, 44] ; however, the feasibility of this has been questioned [45, 46] . While the ultimate goal of eradication of certain pathogens should be kept in mind, it is questionable whether any equine diseases will be eradicated in the near (or even distant) future.

Certainly, vaccination is an important component for prevention of many infectious diseases. The availability of safe and effective vaccines has had a profound impact on equine health, at both individual animal and population levels. Vaccine efficacy is variable, population-based research to guide the most effective vaccination approaches is limited and compliance is sporadic, yet vaccination remains a key component for the control of infectious disease. However, while important, vaccination should not be the cornerstone of an infection control programme. Rather, vaccination should be used to reduce the risk of disease when measures to reduce the risk of exposure are ineffective or impractical. The response to the question 'What is your infection control programme?' should never be 'I vaccinate against. . .'. There has always been some understanding of the need for infection control and basic principles of infection control, and this has increased in recent years, in part because of incidents such as those described above. Yet, there are limited objective data regarding the usefulness of most infection control measures in horses, including longstanding and widely used practices. Important and basic questions remain unanswered, only a few of which are presented in Table 2 . Indeed, it is difficult to cite proper studies that have evaluated the efficacy of nonpharmaceutical approaches to reduce infectious diseases in horses. Many reasons account for this. One is the limited number of individuals with an interest in equine infection control research. Limited funding opportunities for evaluation of infection control interventions may also play a role. Practical aspects of study design and implementation also complicate the field. Ultimately, it will probably be impossible to assess some common approaches in controlled studies because of resistance of caretakers to be part of a controlled study and the ethical aspects of using a placebo group to test a practice that is widely considered to be effective (e.g. not cohorting horses in the event of an outbreak).

In others, they are most similar to man or household pets (e.g. travel, potential for encountering numerous outside individuals, potential use of expensive treatment and preventive measures) and in some respects there may be no reasonable comparison with other species. Data from other species should therefore not be ignored but should be used as general guidance or for hypothesis generation, and not typically direct extrapolation.
