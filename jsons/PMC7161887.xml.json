            "text": "Newcastle disease (ND) is the most severe avian disease caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV), affecting economic catastrophe in poultry throughout the world 1. Currently, the existence of NDV in the world chicken population has been extensively reported 2. NDV has an extensive host range that can infect more than 200 avian species. Chicken is the most susceptible host to NDV, which leads to intermittent infections 3, 4. NDV belongs to genus Avulavirus, family Paramyxoviridae, and order Mononegavirales 5. NDV is majorly classified into four pathotypes, such as viscerotropic, neurotropic, mesogenic, and lentogenic. It is an enveloped, negative sense single\u2010stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of 15 kb nucleotides length, which codes for six major proteins 6. One very important feature of many viruses is that their surface is covered with either glycoproteins or carbohydrate recognition molecules. It has been recognized for some time that this glycosylation is vital to viral infectivity or replication as well as in the production of active viral particles 7. Fusion (F) and heamgglutinin\u2010neuraminidase (HN) are important glycoproteins that play a major role in the viral entry. Fusion protein is responsible for fusion of viral envelope and mediates cell membrane conformational changes, whereas HN protein is responsible for cell binding 8. The F protein is synthesized in the beginning as a precursor F0, which is then cleaved to F1 and F2 active precursors by an enzyme furin present in the host cell, which are the key contributors for NDV pathogenicity 9.",

            "text": "It is well established that the viral infections that induce oxidative stress by direct viral effects on cells or by inflammatory responses from host are the common pathways for the damage of tissues 10. The imbalance between pro\u2010oxidants and endogenous antioxidants in living cell or tissues leads to the development of oxidative damage to the cells. Typically, oxidative stress is initiated by the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which play a vital role in tissue damage 11. An endogenously formed reactive nitrogen oxide during viral replication has the potential to mutant both the viruses and host, which results in tissue injury due to oxidative stress, by oxidation and nitration of biomolecules 12. RNS to an extent possess a lower antiviral activity against many DNA viruses such as murine poxvirus, herpesviruses, Epstein\u2010Barr virus, and some RNA viruses such as coxsackievirus. However, these RNS species do not show antiviral activity against the ortho\u2010 and paramyxovirus, coronavirus, and others. Increased RNS during the viral replication leads to oxidative stress and damage to the biological molecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids 13, 14. It is reported that the oxidative stress occupies a major role in pathogenesis in many diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, hepatorenal syndrome, atherosclerosis, and hypertension 15.",

In the present scenario, NRTIs are the priority drugs to treat life\u2010threatening diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Herpes virus, small pox virus, cancer, and hepatitis 16. These NRTIs exert biological activity both by inhibiting viral RNA or DNA or cellular and as terminators of chain elongation or inhibiting enzymes like polymerases 17. Hotard et al. 18 stated that NRTIs shows high antiviral activity against henipaviruses and other paramyxoviruses. Abacavir (ABC) is a carbocyclic nucleoside analogue that terminates the replication of viral gene elongation by incorporating a nucleoside analogue into the new viral gene 19. There are 26 antiretroviral drugs approved by US\u2010FDA for clinical use; these drugs are effective when used in combinations, even though none of them are considered ideal due to their toxic effects and ascendance of creating drug\u2010resistant mutants 20. Controlling mechanism of NRTIs against host cell has limitations including low solubility and low bioavailability, toxicity, hypertension, lacking target specificity, short half\u2010life, cellular toxicities, and unstable at acidic conditions 21. Hence, it is important to design the antiviral drugs with limited toxic effects and more solubility and bioavailability. Youcef et al. 22 reported that these disadvantages of nucleoside drug could be prevailed over by phosphorylated prodrugs.",

Immuno colocalization studies of tissue sections indicated that the NDV\u2010infected chickens have more oxidized protein with large number of hepatic stellate cells in liver (Fig. 3H) and clara cells in lung tissue (Fig. 4H) when compared to healthy control animals (Figs. 3 and 4G). In contrast, cellular alterations were minimal or decreased in the liver and lung of the NDV\u2010infected group treated with ABC\u20101 (NDV + ABC\u20101) (Figs. 3 and 4I). The intensity of fluorescence was quantified and represented in bar chart graph (Fig. 10B). Immunofluorescence studies of protein nitration were carried out by anti\u2010nitrotyrosine antibody. Similar to the protein oxidation, protein nitration is significantly altered in the NDV\u2010infected animal tissues (Figs. 5 and 6H) compared to control animals (Figs. 5 and 6G), whereas these alterations decreased significantly in the NDV + ABC\u20101\u2010treated group (Figs. 5 and 6I), and the quantification of fluorescence values was presented in bar chart graph (Fig. 10A).",

Due to the lack of early diagnosis and treatment, viral infections deleteriously affect the poultry sector causing huge economic loss to farmers 31. Of the poultry viruses, NDV is the devastating one, which causes 100% mortality by killing entire flocks. NDV infection is an airborne disease, which is transmitted by air from infected birds to healthy chickens 32. Oxidative stress is implicated as a pathogenic factor in several viral infections. It is well known that RNA viruses such as influenza virus, hepatitis c virus (HCV), and HIV induce oxidative damage, which contributes to various aspects of viral pathogenesis 33. First evidence of oxidative stress induced during viral infections was noticed during paramyxovirus where Sendai virus increased the production of reactive species during viral infection 34. It is well known that NDV mesogenic and velogenic strains lead to oxidative stress, resulting in the increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase in vital organs of chickens 35. Recently, we had shown that the NDV\u2010infected group shows increased lipid peroxidation and decreased superoxide dismutase and catalase. These perturbations were reduced in treatment with novel phosphorylated ABC\u20101 than native ABC 23. Similar to the other RNA viruses, RNA from NDV virus induces oxidative damage, a condition of imbalance between ROS and host antioxidant mechanism leads to increased lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in tissues 36. Oxidative stress is caused when cells are exposed to more amount of ROS like H2O2 or O2\u2212. In the present study, NDV\u2010induced pathogenesis and oxidative damage in the vital organs of chicken liver and lung were measured by oxidation and nitration of tissue proteins and also evaluated the protective role of novel phosphorylated ABC\u20101.",

These oxidative modifications are induced in various diseased conditions in vivo; protein oxidation serves as the marker for measuring the oxidative stress in vivo\n37. Protein nitration is an imperative oxidative damage caused by peroxynitrile radicals and has significant role in disease pathogenesis, which regulates the phosphorylation of proteins 38. The by\u2010products produced during oxidative damage are more stable than the ROS or RNS and can be measured by their products such as lipid peroxidation. Our earlier studies have shown an upsurge in the lipid peroxidation levels while chickens were infected with NDV and decreased upon treatment, which indicates that NDV induced oxidative stress 23. In the present study, we have measured oxidative damage in chickens infected with NDV using distinct techniques such as ELISA, Western blot analysis, and immuno colocalization studies. DNPH and 3\u2010nitrotyrosine primary antibodies that are specific for detecting protein oxidation and nitration were used. As a preliminary test, ELISA test was performed and results demonstrated that protein carbonyls and nitrated protein levels were significantly increased in the NDV\u2010infected group than that of control chicken, whereas these levels were significantly reduced in the ABC\u20101\u2010treated group (Figs. 1 and 2). After ELISA results being positive for oxidative damage, western blot analysis was carried out in control, NDV\u2010infected, and ABC\u20101\u2010treated groups in liver and lung tissues. Blotting analysis of the tissue showed a distinct intensified band patterns in the NDV\u2010infected group compared to control and the treated group (Fig. 7). The extent of tissue damage caused due to viral pathogenesis was also determined by immuno colocalization assay, and the results correlated well with ELISA and western blot analysis; the NDV\u2010infected group tissue showed large number of immuno colocalized stellate hepatic cells and clara cells in liver and lung, respectively, than control chicken tissue. These colocalized cells were decreased during treatment with novel phosphorylated compounds. Similar type of result was observed previously during NDV infection and treatment with vitamin E 14. A large body of evidence suggested that most of the viruses cause oxidative damage by protein oxidation and nitration. Antiviral compounds were used to protect from these viral infections and their consequently produced oxidative damage. P\u2010icariin, a phosphorylated compound, has produced protection in oxidative damage and improved survival of animals during Duck viral hepatitis infection 37.",

Fusion protein was initially synthesized as F0 inactive precursor, thereafter cleaved by host to biologically active F1 and F2 units. The cleavage of the fusion protein is important for viral entry and cell\u2010to\u2010cell fusion 39. These novel phosphorylated compounds were effective against NDV both in vitro and in vivo; in the present study, fusion protein was targeted to identify whether these compounds inhibit its development. To evaluate the expression levels of fusion protein in the vital organs of NDV\u2010infected tissues, immuno fluorescence, PCR, and flow cytometry assays were performed. Immuno colocalization of viral F\u2010protein was hypothesized as a conformational change of fusion protein that is associated with the membrane\u2010bound fusion protein; immunofluorescence of cells infected with NDV predominantly expresses the cleaved fusion protein 28. Ailing et al. 40 experimentally infected geese with NDV, and NDV fusion protein was detected in tissues by immunohistochemical assay. Emetine dihydrochloride, an ipecac alkaloid, has inhibitory activity against dengue virus evaluated by immuno fluorescence, which is a protein and nucleic acid inhibitor. Similarly, the present study demonstrated that NDV\u2010infected chicken liver and lung sections had uncovered numerous colocalized hepatic and clara cells, signifying the relentlessness of viral pathogenesis (Figs. 8 and 9). Although immuno colocalization studies have shown a clear positive signal for fusion protein, further to evaluate and quantify the extent of fusion protein levels, which was also detected using PCR and FACS analysis. The mRNA expression of NDV fusion gene was measured by PCR in comparison with control\u2013infected and infected\u2013treated. The results express that mRNA expression of fusion gene is relatively lower in treatment with ABC\u20101 compound compared to the NDV infection group. The increasing intensity of band in the NDV\u2010infected group indicates more amount of viral replication, whereas in treated groups the band intensity decreased, which might be due to the inhibition of fusion gene by novel phosphorylated compound (Fig. 11). Previous studies with matrix gene of NDV in murine macrophage cells infected with NDV virus had increasing intensity of bands, which decreased during the treatment with HM\u2010\u03b3\u2010PGA 41. A fluorescence\u2010activated cell sorter was used to detect and quantify the virus\u2010infected cells in tissues. Anti\u2010F mAb 8E12A8C3 that specifically binds to the NDV fusion protein present in tissues was tagged with fluorescent secondary antibody AF\u2010350 anti\u2010mouse that was used to capture the signal in FACS assay. The FACS assay showed that in NDV infection alone the fusion protein levels were higher than that in comparison with ABC\u20101\u2010treated group tissues (Fig. 12). Previously cytomegalovirus antigen was detected with a monoclonal antibody by fluorescent flow cytometry to quantify the viral antigen content in infected and uninfected cells 30. Even though the two novel phosphorylated compounds had potential antiviral properties, fusion protein is major determinant of the NDV virus pathogenicity and its replication. Based on the above results, it was clear that ABC\u20101 has inhibited the fusion protein levels, hence these results put forth that the novel compound might be potent inhibitors of NDV disease virus, as detected using various assays.",

These perturbations were brought down to normal in the NDV\u2010infected group treated with novel phosphorylated compounds. Further examinations of immuno colocalization, PCR, and flow cytometry analysis show that the novel phosphorylated compounds are effective in inhibiting the fusion protein expression, which is important in replication of NDV virus. The significant finding of this study is that novel phosphorylated antiviral compounds ABC\u20101 protect the NDV\u2010infected chicken through its antiviral properties. In summary, the novel phosphorylated abacavir (ABC\u20101) potentially reduces the NDV\u2010induced tissue oxidative stress and inhibits the expression of fusion protein.",
