Successful conservation plans, however, are not solely achieved by acquiring optimally designed reserves. Ongoing monitoring and management of species in those reserves is equally important but often neglected or poorly executed (Olsen et al., 1999; Yoccoz et al., 2001; Noon, 2003; Barrows et al., 2005). Indeed, despite the large number of systematic planning tools available, conservation planning has been described as succumbing to an \u2018implementation crisis\u2019 (Salafsky et al., 2002; Knight et al., 2006). As a result, the conservation community is increasingly concerned with monitoring and measuring success of conservation actions (e.g. Conservation Measures Partnership, http://www.conservationmeasures.org). In this paper we address one of the first and most important steps in designing a monitoring program \u2013 deciding what to monitor.",

The importance of explicitly considering budgets in the formulation and allocation phases of monitoring and management has been highlighted in the literature (Haight et al., 2002; Field et al., 2004, 2005; Hauser et al., 2006). Most studies assume that budgets are known and constant. However, when monitoring and management are conducted in an adaptive framework and are administered by a consortium of government agencies, non\u2010government organizations, and private land owners, the total budget for monitoring activities is often unknown at the outset, changes over time, and depends somewhat on monitoring and management priorities. Volunteer groups also play an increasing role in monitoring and managing local biodiversity and can contribute to ongoing monitoring with minimal to no expenditure (Hoyer et al., 2001; Markovchick\u2010Nicholls et al. in press), and there may be other ways to leverage funding for monitoring. Hence, while it is sensible to explicitly consider the available budget in planning monitoring and management activities, in practice it is prudent to devise a prioritization scheme for monitoring that is flexible enough to deal with statutory standards and realistic uncertainties and constraints.",

Rarely can all components of biodiversity be monitored: some triage must occur at the outset (Possingham et al., 2001). This step is crucial for the implementation of a monitoring plan because it lays the foundation for all future activities and decisions. Once a monitoring program has gained momentum it may be difficult to change priorities because of perceived or actual \u2018return on investments\u2019 in components for which the monitoring budget has already been allocated. Hence, it is important to base prioritization decisions on sound science and directly relate them to the goals and objectives of the conservation plan as a first step in structuring a monitoring program.",

This objective essentially relates to minimizing extinctions in an established conservation area.",

The first is to assess the status of biodiversity, and the second is to measure the effectiveness of management actions. These two motivations are tightly linked \u2013 decisions to take management action will be based on assessments of status and trends, while evaluations of the impact of management rely on assessments of status and trends in reference and managed scenarios. The major difference is that evaluations of management impact may not necessarily involve direct measurement of the intended beneficiary of the action. For example, if the management action is the abatement of a known threat, then the impact on the threat itself may be measured. Hence, it is important to distinguish between these two motivations for monitoring because this will determine monitoring priorities. In this paper, we address the first of these, prioritizing species for the purpose of monitoring status and trends, because this is most certainly the precursor of informed management decisions and links directly to monitoring of management impacts.",

We consider both broad and local spatial scales to capture the regional conservation context and the practicalities of local management and monitoring constraints. We demonstrate the utility of this strategy through application to a set of 85 plants and animals in an established multispecies conservation plan in San Diego County, California, USA.

The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) was one of the first regional plans developed and approved under the California Natural Community Conservation Planning Act. Its primary goal is to conserve natural communities at the ecosystem scale before species decline to the point of requiring protection under federal or state Endangered Species Acts, while allowing \u2018compatible land uses\u2019 (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 1996). The MSCP is also intended to provide protection and management for species already listed under the federal and state Endangered Species Acts to offset incidental take in developed areas outside the preserve. As of 2004, over 51,800 ha had been included in the preserve and lands continue to be added by the 14 participating jurisdictions and wildlife agencies (San Diego Association of Governments, HabiTrak GIS data). The 85 covered species targeted for protection under the San Diego MSCP include 39 animal and 46 plant species (see Appendices S1 and S2 in Supplementary Material). The covered species list comprises rare, threatened, and endangered species, as well as common and endemic species and species intended to serve as focal species and indicators of reserve connectivity. For more details on the creation and administration of the MSCP see Ogden Environmental and Energy Services (1998) and Hierl et al. (2005).",

Previous monitoring recommendations (Ogden Environmental & Energy Services, 1996; Atkinson et al., 2004), while well structured and motivated, have faltered in part because of a perceived lack of explicit rationale and documented justification for monitoring priorities. The MSCP lists several objectives for biological monitoring, each of which will require a separate prioritization and monitoring program: document ecological status and trends, evaluate the effectiveness of management activities, provide new data on species populations and wildlife movement, and evaluate the indirect impacts of threats. Here, we present an explicit stepwise approach to prioritizing large sets of covered species for monitoring in multispecies conservation plans that is concordant with many of the stated MSCP monitoring objectives.",

Species were assigned to one of three broad at\u2010risk groups (Risk Group 1, 2, or 3 in descending order of risk level). Species classified as federally endangered (FE), G1 (NatureServe global ranks), and S1 (state rankings) received a ranking of 1.

First, the steps assume the pool of species is large, perhaps much larger than the covered species list (as was the case for the USDA Forest Service species viability assessments). Ideally, the first tier approach to prioritization should be used to identify covered species for a multispecies conservation plan at the outset (Margules & Pressey, 2000; Groves, 2003). The MSCP covered species list is already the result of an ad hoc prioritization. Hence, application of steps 1\u20136 may not reduce the candidate species for monitoring any further. Second, for species not listed as rare, threatened, or endangered, it is highly uncertain that they actually do serve as surrogates due to a lack of documented rationale and scientific justification for their inclusion as covered focal species. Third, insufficient resources may exist to monitor all species identified from steps 1\u20136 as at\u2010risk or focal species.

Evidence of this is that many high\u2010priority species have received no monitoring attention to date, and lower\u2010priority species have (Fig. 1; see also Appendix S4 in Supplementary Material). For instance, almost all of the animals in Risk Group 2 receive some monitoring, whereas less than half of the animals in Risk Group 1 receive any monitoring at all. Plants fare slightly better in that more Risk Group 1 species are currently monitored than plants in the lower risk groups, but they fare worse than animals in the number of species monitored, even though there are more covered plants than animals. It is clear from this analysis that undocumented biases currently exist in MSCP monitoring priorities and that these need to be addressed in future monitoring decisions.",

It should be noted, however, that \u2018habitat\u2019 is a species\u2010based concept. For the purpose of MSCP species monitoring, it is only relevant to prioritize habitats in terms of the covered species occurring there and the threats those species face within their habitat (as opposed to the threats to the habitat itself). While threats to the habitat itself are significant risk factors, they are a subset of the many threats covered species face. Species life\u2010history traits and their response to all major risk factors need to be considered in designing habitat monitoring and such monitoring should be performed in conjunction with other species\u2010specific monitoring. It will be insufficient to monitor habitat cover through aerial photographs, for instance, when predation is a major risk factor for a given species. Habitat monitoring, performed in an appropriate way for the associated covered species, could have the greatest value if performed in areas where the most covered species occur.",

Despite many years of effort, the utility of focal species remains controversial (National Research Council, 1995; Niemi et al., 1997; Lindenmeyer, 1999; Andelman & Fagan, 2000). We argue that even though focal species concepts are often invoked in the selection of conservation targets, a risk\u2010based approach to species prioritization is better justified for status and trend monitoring. This is because of the necessity of directly managing and monitoring at\u2010risk species, the paucity of evidence establishing the validity of focal species in many cases, and the difficulties in structuring a monitoring plan to capture status and trends of focal species that are meaningful for the broader biodiversity (Rubinoff, 2001; Lindenmeyer et al., 2002).",

We suggest that the prioritization methods presented here can be used to make monitoring decisions about an alternative indicator of status and trend\u2013threats. The results in Appendix S4 provide information on the most prominent threats and the species impacted by them in the MSCP. 2, 3 reveal the habitats containing the most threats to species. This information can be used to identify the most serious threats to covered species and where those threats occur. Six threats stand out as the most serious for most of the covered species: habitat loss, invasive species, off\u2010road vehicles, recreation/human disturbance, altered fire regime, and altered hydrology. While it is always preferable to monitor the covered species directly if resources allow, threats may be a more feasible alternative for monitoring status and trends. They may also be more reliable and relevant than focal species for a monitoring plan because they directly link to management (as highlighted previously by Salafsky & Margoluis, 1999).",

While prioritization for monitoring status and trends of target species is an important first step in such a framework, it is insufficient on its own as a tool for ensuring a successful conservation plan. Ongoing management and subsequent evaluation will be necessary to determine if the conservation plan is meeting its stated objectives. It may also be necessary to monitor and evaluate additional components of biodiversity, such as communities or ecosystems, to determine if the objectives of the conservation plan are being met. In an adaptive management framework, knowledge about changes gained from managing biodiversity should be used to update priorities for status and trend monitoring. If new threats appear, or if the status of a species changes, monitoring priorities should be revised accordingly.",
