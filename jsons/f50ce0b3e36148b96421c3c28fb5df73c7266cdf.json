At that time, we did not wonder why it was in the cod or how it got there. The early research history relating to vitamin D has been recounted many times, for instance, by DeLuca ( 1997 ) , and only a short summary will be given here. Rickets was fi rst described in England by Whistler ( 1645 ) and Glisson ( 1650 ) . In the next century, Sniadecki established a connection between skeleton malformation and lack of sunlight among children in Warsaw (Mozolowski 1939 ) . The disease became known as the English disease in many countries. Mellanby ( 1918 ) demonstrated that rickets ( Fig. 23 .1 ) could be prevented in dogs by supplementing their diet with cod liver oil, and Hess and Unger ( 1921 ) showed that rickets could be cured by sunlight. Hess and Weinstock ( 1924 ) and Steenbock and Black ( 1924 ) showed that the exposure of lettuce and several other foodstuffs to radiation from a mercury vapour lamp would render them antirachitic.",

The reason that there is no vitamin D 1 is that the product fi rst given this name turned out not to be a single compound but a mixture. In some non-mammal vertebrates, other compounds act in a similar way as vitamins D 2 and D 3 (Holick 1989 ), but they have not been chemically defi ned. In most organisms, the synthesis of vitamin D requires UV-B radiation. Exceptions to this rule will be described later. Vitamin D is formed from the provitamins (provitamin D 2 , also called ergosterol, and provitamin D 3 , also called 7-dehydrocholesterol). UV-B radiation can photoisomerise the provitamins to the corresponding previtamins, either in vivo without the mediation of any enzyme or in solution.",

This is insuffi cient for prevention of defi ciency if exposure to UV-B radiation does not supplement the intake. It was found, e.g. that Moslems in Denmark were still defi cient after taking 15 \u03bcg/day (Glerup et al. 2000 ) . Attempts to avoid the need for UV exposure by high daily intake (over 50 \u03bcg daily) cannot be recommended, as this can lead to vitamin D intoxication. Exposure even to high daily fl uence of UV-B radiation can never lead to vitamin D overdosage, as will be explained below. As mentioned, the vitamin D precursor previtamin D is formed from provitamin D by a photochemical reaction (Figs. 23.2 and 23.3 ) driven by UV radiation (UV-B in the natural condition, but UV-C can also be used artifi cially). But this is far from the only UV-driven reaction in the vitamin D context. The basic photochemistry of the vitamin D system was summarised by Havinga ( 1973 ) . Previtamin D is also sensitive to UV radiation and can undergo three different photoreversible photochemical reactions. It can be either reconverted to provitamin D or converted to lumisterol or tachysterol and further irreversibly to products known under the common name of toxisterols (Boomsma et al. 1975 ) . Vitamin D is sensitive to UV radiation and can be photoconverted to three compounds: 5 , 6trans -vitamin D 3 , suprasterol 1, and suprasterol 2 (Webb et al. 1989 ) . Havinga ( 1973 ) states that the quantum yields are independent of wavelength or at least have the same values at 254 and 313 nm. There is, however, as will be detailed below, an important exception to this rule. Although some literature sources give values slightly different from those of Fig. 23 .3 , there is no indication of differences in quantum yield between the D 2 and D 3 series.",

This quantum yield increases slowly with wavelength from 295 to 302 nm but then doubles from 0.08 at 302 nm to 0.16 at 305 nm and then increases steadily to 0.29 at 325 nm. The quantum yield of cistrans isomerisation to tachysterol decreases correspondingly over the same wavelength range.

It was found that the thermochemical step forming vitamin D, following the photochemical conversion of provitamin D, takes place more quickly in cells than in solutions (Tian et al. 1993 ; Holick et al. 1995 ) . The reason for this is the existence of the conformer of previtamin D (lower right, Fig. 23 . 3 Dmitrenko et al. 2001 ) . In solution, this is the preferred conformer, and it cannot be converted directly to vitamin D. In membranes, both natural and artifi cial liposome membranes (Tian and Holick 1999 ) , the previtamin is held in the active, vitaminproducing conformer (cf. Saltiel et al. 2003 ) . The same effect can be achieved by complexing the previtamin with \u03b2-cyclodextrin .",

Previtamin D can also be photochemically converted to various compounds termed toxisterols (not shown) (From Havinga ( 1973 ) , modifi ed) tachysterol, the conversion of provitamin to previtamin is favoured at long wavelengths, while at shorter wavelengths the back and side reactions of previtamin are important competitors. Probably, under the conditions in which the action spectrum was determined, the fi rst reason is more important. Lehmann et al. ( 2001 ) measured the action spectra for formation of vitamin D 3 as well as 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 (1\u03b1,25dihydroxyvitamin D 3 ) from provitamin D 3 in \"artifi cial skin\" containing cultured human keratinocytes. Remarkably, this action spectrum is displaced about 5 nm towards longer wavelength (peaking at about 302 nm) compared to the spectrum determined by MacLaughlin et al. ( 1982 ) . Although no wavelength below 285 nm was tested, the spectrum indicates a rise from 293 nm towards shorter wavelengths. The minimum at approximately 293 nm is deeper than would be expected from the provitamin D 3 absorption spectrum. Takada et al. ( 1979 ) investigated the spectral dependence of vitamin D 3 formation in shaved cat skin. They found a maximum at 303 nm, similar to Lehmann et al. ( 2001 ) . Their long-wavelength tail extends all the way to 340 nm. However, their spectrum must be regarded as very approximate, since it is plotted as effect at constant fl uence, and the spectral bandwidth of the radiation is not stated. As the spectra of MacLaughlin et al. ( 1982 ) and Lehmann et al. ( 2001 ) , it is plotted on an energy rather than photon basis and, therefore, not expected to match an absorption spectrum exactly. Knudson and Benford ( 1938 ) compared the effectiveness of different UV wavebands in preventing rickets in shaved rats. They found a peak at approximately the same wavelength as MacLaughlin et al. ( 1982 ) but also a (higher) peak at about 280 nm.",

This is highest in the summer months and decreases to 5 % of this value at mid-latitudes in the winter and is zero at higher latitudes. One recent study Absorption spectrum for provitamin D 3 (Pro D), action spectrum for photosynthesis of previtamin D 3 (Pre D) according to MacLaughlin et al. ( 1982 ) , and action spectra for photosynthesis of vitamin D 3 (D) and 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (D(OH) 2 ) according to Lehmann et al. ( 2001 ) illustrates clearly how the solar UV-B irradiation affects the vitamin D status of a population. In the USA, the peak in vitamin D levels was found in August and the trough in February, a lag of 8 weeks after the peak and trough respectively in ambient UV-B (Kasahara et al. 2013 ). The solar zenith angle also explains why at least 50 % of the daily UV radiation is found in the 4 h period around local noon. Other environmental variables are ozone, cloud cover, air pollution, altitude, and surface refl ection, such as from snow or choppy water. There are also large differences between individuals in their ability to produce active vitamin D following a given dose of solar UV-B. These include skin type, age, amount of clothing worn and head cover, use of sunscreen, body mass index, serum cholesterol level, polymorphisms in VDR and enzymes of the vitamin D pathway, and baseline 25(OH)D. For example, to synthesise the same amount of previtamin D 3 , about a sixfold higher dose of UV-B is required for black skin compared with fair skin (due to absorption by melanin) (Clemens et al. 1982 ) , and a twofold higher dose is required for an 80-year-old compared with a 20-year-old (due to the reduction in 7-dehydrocholesterol in older skin) (MacLaughlin and Holick 1985 ).",

In the 1990s, the threshold for defi ciency was frequently defi ned as <25 nmol/L 25(OH)D. In 2010, the US Institute of Medicine defi ned suffi ciency as a serum concentration of 50 nmol/L or above for both adults and children (Institute of Medicine 2011 ). Others working in the area recommend much higher levels. For example, the Vitamin D Council advocates at least 125 nmol/L 25(OH)D ( www. vitamindcouncil.org/about-vitamin-d/vitamin-d-deficiency/ ). Concentrations higher than 250 nmol/L may be harmful. Some surveys suggest that there has been a decline in vitamin D status in populations in recent years. Thus there was a reduction from 75 nmol /L in 1988-1994 to 60 nmol/L in 2001-2004 in the large National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey in the USA (Ginde et al. 2009a ) . Epidemiological studies in several parts of the world indicate that an insuffi cient vitamin D status may be widespread, even in sunny countries. For example, 31 % of a large representative adult population in Australia, 21.4 % of women of child-bearing age in Oman, and 57 % of women and 49 % of men, aged 65 and above, in England all had 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L. Efforts have been made to construct models using the action spectrum from the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D 3 in the human skin to predict how much sun exposure an individual requires under different climate conditions to ensure a satisfactory vitamin D status ( McKenzie et al. 2009 ( McKenzie et al. , 2011 Diffey 2010 ) . This approach has been supplemented by actual measurement of 25(OH)D levels in volunteers with different skin types, exposed to the simulated sunlight present at particular latitudes at different times of the year (Rhodes et al. 2010 ).",

The disease that results from the defi ciency in children is called rickets in which bone deformities are found due to chondrocyte disaggregation and skeletal mineralisation defects. It is estimated that 25(OH)D levels lower than about 20 nmol/L can lead to rickets. Supplementation with vitamin D is recommended for infants aged 0-12 months. In adults, osteomalacia can result from vitamin D defi ciency, with defective mineralisation of the collagen matrix and hence reduced structural support and increased risk of fracture. Osteoporosis can also occur in the elderly with an increased risk of fracture. Osteoblast activity is reduced and bone mineralisation is defective. Although various studies have not produced consistent results, they suggest that 25(OH)D levels above 75 nmol/L are required for protection against osteomalacia and osteoporosis (reviewed in Wacker and Holick 2013 ) .",

Vitamin D also acts indirectly on calcium and phosphorus levels via the regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Low levels of 25(OH)D are associated with low levels of serum-ionised calcium, a situation which leads to increased PTH levels. Higher 25(OH)D levels with associated higher calcium levels have the reverse effects on PTH. Both PTH and 1,25(OH) 2 D stimulate osteoblasts to mobilise calcium stores.

These could have relevance for the control of several human diseases and have been the subject of intense investigations in recent years. Innate immunity involves a range of mechanisms that are often of most benefi t at the initiation of a disease. Several innate immune responses are stimulated by 1,25(OH) 2 D. One important effect is to promote the expression of the cathelicidin gene in macrophages which leads to the production of cathelicidin (Liu et al. 2007 ). This peptide has antimicrobial activity against intracellular bacteria. 1,25(OH) 2 D induces autophagy in monocytes and macrophages via the induction of cathelicidin which then activates transcription of the autophagy-related genes (Yuk et al. 2009 ). Autophagy is the process whereby a cell self-digests through the action of enzymes within the same cell, thus preventing the survival of intracellular bacteria and viruses. Low levels of vitamin D result in impaired development of invariant natural killer T cells, a consequence that is particularly apparent if the deficiency occurs in utero (Cantorna et al. 2012 ) . The invariant natural killer T cells are involved in many immunological processes; they recognise lipids and glycolipids rather than the peptide-MHC complexes recognised by other T cell subsets, and, on activation, produce a range of immunostimulatory mediators including interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1.",

Several disease categories in which vitamin D may play an important role by modulating the immune response have been described. These cover a wide range of common conditions. The evidence frequently relies on the group of patients with the disease having a lower 25(OH)D level than the group of controls. However, few of these studies are prospective and therefore cannot distinguish whether the low status is a consequence of the disease or is a signifi cant risk factor. Clinical trials using vitamin D supplements to prevent the disease or, more commonly, as a treatment have yielded inconsistent results thus far. In addition, it is diffi cult and frequently impossible to separate the effects of solar UV radiation from the effects of vitamin D in human subjects (Hart and Gorman 2013 ) .

Although there could be several explanations for this, including increased survival and transmission of viruses at low temperature and humidity, one suggestion, fi rst made more than 30 years ago (Hope-Simpson 1981 ) , attributed the pattern to the lower level of vitamin D in the winter months as the solar UV-B radiation declines. As outlined in Sect. 23.6.1 , many aspects of innate immunity which are important in protection against viral infection of the respiratory tract are diminished by insuffi cient vitamin D. In particular, the reduced production of antimicrobial peptides by neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells of the respiratory tract and by epithelial cells may be important as well as the lack of autophagy in macrophages.

However, it should be noted that in almost all of these studies, the population already had symptoms of the infection at the time of the 25(OH)D assessment. Thus whether a low vitamin D status contributes to the risk of a symptomatic infection or is a consequence of the infection cannot be distinguished. About eight prospective randomised double-blind trials have taken place which examined whether vitamin D 3 supplements can prevent respiratory infections. No consistent difference in the risk of respiratory infection between those taking the supplement and those given a placebo was found (reviewed in Bergman et al. 2013 ).

In the nineteenth century, cod liver oil, which contains the highest level of vitamin D 3 of any food, was used in Europe to prevent childhood diseases such as tuberculosis. It was superseded by heliotherapy (sun exposure) and phototherapy (exposure to artifi cial light sources) before the development of antibiotics in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus a possible link between vitamin D defi ciency and susceptibility to tuberculosis or disease progression has a long history. More recent studies consistently report that subjects with tuberculosis have insuffi cient 25(OH)D levels or lower levels than control subjects (reviewed in Ralph et al. 2013 ) . It is clearly diffi cult to investigate whether vitamin D status infl uences susceptibility to infection with M. tuberculosis and development of active disease from latency or response to treatment. In particular, whether a low 25(OH)D level is a consequence of the disease or a risk factor for, it needs to be distinguished. This can only be examined in prospective studies. Clinical trials using vitamin D supplements to prevent progression from latent to active tuberculosis have not been undertaken as yet, but other trials in which the supplements were administered to treat active disease have yielded predominantly negative results. The reasons that these trials do not support the observational fi ndings include the possibilities that suboptimal doses of the supplement were used or that they did not lead to a suffi cient increase in 1,25(OH) 2 D or that host determinants were not taken into account such as expression of the hydroxylases and the vitamin D-binding protein and polymorphisms in the VDR (Ralph et al. 2013 ).",

Such a gradient has been shown most convincingly for multiple sclerosis (MS) but is also found to a lesser degree for type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Although the aetiology of these diseases is multifactorial with a clear genetic susceptibility, there is evidence that one environmental risk factor might be low exposure to solar UV radiation leading to insuffi cient vitamin D. As outlined in Sect. 23.6.1 above, 1,25(OH) 2 D has effects on the immune system that could help to prevent autoimmunity. In brief, it can counteract autoimmune infl ammation, induce the differentiation of T regulatory cells that promote selftolerance, inhibit the differentiation of dendritic cells and their ability to present antigen, and increase the production of immunosuppressive cytokines. Of the autoimmune diseases and their possible link with vitamin D, most information has been published for MS. In MS, there is immune-mediated destruction of myelinproducing cells and axonal loss in the central nervous system, and it is the most frequent disabling neurological disorder of young adults. The latitudinal gradient for MS was fi rst noted more than 50 years ago (Acheson and Bachrach 1960 ) and has been validated in more recent reports, including a comprehensive meta-analysis of global data in 2011 (Simpson et al. 2011 ) . A similar latitudinal variation in the incidence of the common precursor of MS, called fi rst central nervous system demyelinating events, has also been found (Taylor et al. 2010 ) . Low ambient UV radiation or low sun exposure in childhood may be particularly signifi cant in increasing the risk of MS in later life. Also, the month of birth has an important effect on the risk of MS development in the offspring; an increased risk for those born in the spring when maternal 25(OH)D levels are likely to be low and a decreased risk for those born in the late autumn/early winter when maternal 25(OH)D levels are likely to be higher ). In two large cohort studies in the USA, a higher vitamin D intake in the form of supplements and higher serum 25(OH)D levels were both linked to a decreased risk of MS (Munger et al. 2004 ; Munger et al. 2006 ). There was a particularly strong inverse relationship if the higher 25(OH)D level occurred before the age of 20 years. Furthermore the relapse rates for MS correlate inversely with serum 25(OH)D levels.",

This is now changing. Recently, there has been much interest in comparing the effects of vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 in human nutrition (Horst et al. 2000 ) . When administered over a prolonged time , both are equally well taken up and converted to 25(OH)D circulating in the blood stream and also hydroxylated a second time to 1,25(OH) 2 D. Tsugawa et al. ( 1999 ) found that the D 2 form of 1,25(OH) 2 D binds equally well as the D 3 form to the VDR. However, this experiment used calf VDR, and the results may not apply to the polymorphic forms of the human receptor. The D 2 forms are not converted to the corresponding D 3 forms (Holick et al. 2008 ; Biancuzzo et al. 2013 ) . Some of the vitamin D, D 2, as well as D 3 is also converted to 1,24,25-hydroxylated forms. While 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 3 can bind to the VDR and exert biological activity, 1,24,25(OH) 3 D 2 is inactive (see Houghton and Vieth 2006 for this and related topics), and this results in vitamin D 2 having less overall activity than vitamin D 3 . It should be noted that differences in effects between D 2 and D 3 forms are not as large in humans as in rats and birds.",

            "text": "Among microalgae, several (but not all) species of the green algae Chlorella (Patterson 1971 ) and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Patterson 1974 ) contain ergosterol. This provitamin has also been found in the diatom Skeletonema menzelii , the coccolithophorid Emaliana huxleyi (Holick 1989 ) , and the chrysophycean Ochromonas danica (Gershengorn et al. 1968 ). In addition, there have been numerous investigations on phytoplankton of mixed composition. In one instance, a correlation with the probable UV exposure was established, using season as a proxy for irradiation (Takeuchi et al. 1991 ; see also Tables 1a and 1b in Bj\u00f6rn and Wang 2001 ) . Among macroalgae, not only ergosterol but also provitamin D 2 and vitamins D 2 and D 3 have been found in the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus grown under natural conditions with a higher content of the vitamins at a lower (southern Sweden) than at a higher (northern Norway) latitude. Provitamin D 3 is present in the gametophyte of the red alga Chondrus crispus , while the sporophyte of the same species contains the isomer 22-dehydrocholesterol. Higher plants generally contain provitamins and vitamins D 2 and D 3 in their leaves (Napoli et al. 1977 ; Rambeck et al. 1981 ; Horst et al. 1984 ; Prema and Raghuramulu 1996 ; Boland et al. 2003 ) . In general, vitamins are present only after exposure to UV radiation (Hess and Weinstock 1924 ; Skliar et al. 2000 ; Bj\u00f6rn and Wang 2001 and references cited therein) although there are exceptions (see Sect. 23.13 ). Some plants even form the hydroxylated forms of vitamin D (Napoli et al. 1977 ; Skliar et al. 2000 ; Gil et al. 2007 ). Fries ( 1984 ) showed that growth of the green macroalga Enteromorpha compressa , the red alga Nemalion helminthoides , and the brown alga Fucus spiralis is stimulated by vitamins and provitamin D. Vitamin D 3 applied to herbaceous and woody plants stimulates initiation of adventitious roots (Buchala and Schmid 1979 ; Jarvis and Booth 1981 ; Moncousin and Gaspar 1983 ) . Vitamin D at a nanomolar concentration inhibits root elongation in Phaseolus vulgaris and promotes germination of light-sensitive lettuce seed in darkness (Buchala and Pythoud 1988 ) . Vitamin D 3 induces the synthesis of the calcium-binding signalling protein calmodulin in bean roots (Vega and Boland 1986 ).",

This is an inherited (\"racial\") trait that has evolved independently in Europe and Asia (Norton et al. 2007 ), but many individuals can acclimatise phenotypically to some extent (i.e. the skin forms pigment in response to UV radiation; see Chap. 24 and Cui et al. 2007 ). UV radiation can cause skin cancer and other problems, and these effects are particularly frequent for people poorly adapted for the high environmental radiation they are exposed to, such as people of European origin living in South Africa and Australia. Thus, clearly, the pigment works as protection against high radiation. It has been proposed (Branda and Eaton 1978 ; Jablonski and Chaplin 2000 ) that pigmentation is important for photoprotection of folic acid, but in vivo, this substance is photoprotected in another way (Vorobey et al. 2006 ) . Although vitamin D is toxic at too high a concentration, it has been shown by Holick et al. ( 1981 ) that skin pigment is not necessary to prevent its overaccumulation; the photochemical system is self-regulating. The reason for this is the low rate of conversion of previtamin to vitamin, in combination with the photochemical side and back reactions of previtamin D. Thus, toxicity can occur only following excessive intake (e.g. Koutkia et al. 2001 ) .",

All humans are thought to originate from Africa and presumably are all descendants of black-skinned people, although at a prehuman furred stage, lighter skin is possible as found in chimpanzees (Jablonski and Chaplin 2000 ) . But with migration to higher and higher latitudes, the skin colour became paler (Fig. 23.6 ) . The selection pressure for this is clear: avoidance of vitamin D defi ciency (Clemens et al. 1982 ) . African people who have emigrated north in historic time are known to suffer from just such a defi ciency (Shewakramani et al. 2001 ) . Inuits may have more pigment than would be predicted from their northern habitat; their traditional food is from the sea and mostly rich in vitamin D (because the sea currents bring vitamin D from lower and more sunny latitudes), so they have not been exposed to the same selection pressure as people with more terrestrial habits. Jablonski and Chaplin ( 2000 ) found that in all human populations where data were available, the complexion of women is lighter than that of men. It may be diffi cult to separate out the acclimation component due to different lifestyles, but the authors believe that it could be an adaptation to the greater need for calcium and vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation. The relation between skin colour (refl ectance at 685 nm) and latitude for 85 samples of \"indigenous populations\" from different parts of the world. Darker skin colour is lower in the diagram, and on the abscissa, 0 stands for the equator. In the regression equation at the bottom of the graph, y stands for refl ectance in percent and x for latitude in degrees. There is a clear trend of darker skin colour towards the equator. The great variation around the regression curve has several causes. Even \"indigenous populations\" have migrated and settled in their present regions within a time span which is often too short to allow complete adaptation to the environment. The way of life also modulates the need for sunlight. Thus, the square at the highest latitude (a little above 60\u00b0) lies far below the regression curve. It represents Inuits in southern Greenland. It is thought that they, due to their vitamin D-rich food from the sea, have a lesser need for vitamin D from photochemical conversion in the skin than most other populations (Data adapted from those compiled by Jablonski and Chaplin ( 2000 )) The question remains: How do non-human terrestrial vertebrates manage at high latitudes? As they are often covered with hair or plumage or are \"cold-blooded\" (poikilothermic), they would have diffi culties in producing their own vitamin D by having either ineffi cient photochemical conversion of pro-to previtamin or ineffi cient thermochemical conversion of previtamin to vitamin. In fact, amphibians, and reptiles in particular, decline in frequency with increasing latitude. The arctic dinosaurs may, in fact, have been homeothermic (thermoregulating).",

This converts to vitamin D on exposure to sunlight and is ingested at the next preening. Later investigations with more modern methods of analysis have failed to establish with certainty that provitamin D is in the uropygial secretion. There is a single study, using the best analytical methods available at the time, which demonstrated the presence of provitamin D 3 in the uropygial gland of domestic fowl ( Gallus ) (Uva et al. 1978 ) . Such an investigation needs to be repeated using high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and absorption spectroscopy, since the identifi cation of provitamin D 3 among all the steroids present in uropygial secretion is not straightforward. If its presence can be established, the analysis could be extended to other kinds of birds. It should also be mentioned that Holick ( 1989 ;  referring to unpublished observations by himself and M.A. St. Lezin) found no provitamin D 3 in chicken feathers. On the other hand, it is well established that fowl can use UV absorbed by the head and legs to improve their vitamin D and calcium status and egg production. It is assumed that birds like arctic owls and ptarmigans are totally dependent on vitamin D in the food for covering their requirements. Birds cannot effi ciently use vitamin D 2 only D 3 .",

They are covered with hair and do not have a uropygial gland, so they rely heavily on food for their vitamin D. The critical time is the dark winter, and the most important winter food is reindeer lichen. We ) investigated one species of reindeer lichen from different latitudes (Fig. 23.7 ) and found that it contained both vitamins D 2 and D 3 , in a strongly latitudedependent manner, with the lowest values in northern Scandinavia even by the end of the summer. Still, 10 g of the lichen from northern Scandinavia would provide a human with the necessary daily amount, but would humans eat lichen? Wild reindeer survive, even on Spitsbergen island at 78\u00b0N, where the vitamin D content in their food must be lower than this. Could there be another source? It would perhaps be worth looking at what the rumen bacteria can produce.",

Darker skin colour is lower in the diagram, and on the abscissa, 0 stands for the equator. In the regression equation at the bottom of the graph, y stands for refl ectance in percent and x for latitude in degrees. There is a clear trend of darker skin colour towards the equator. The great variation around the regression curve has several causes. Even \"indigenous populations\" have migrated and settled in their present regions within a time span which is often too short to allow complete adaptation to the environment. The way of life also modulates the need for sunlight. Thus, the square at the highest latitude (a little above 60\u00b0) lies far below the regression curve. It represents Inuits in southern Greenland. It is thought that they, due to their vitamin D-rich food from the sea, have a lesser need for vitamin D from photochemical conversion in the skin than most other populations (Data adapted from those compiled by Jablonski and Chaplin ( 2000 ))",
