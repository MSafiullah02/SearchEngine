            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 also called \u2018severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\u2019 abbreviated\nSARS-CoV-2 was recognized to be the causative of atypical pneumonia (Joshi, 2020; Pant et al., 2020) outbreak in Wuhan, China (Hasan, 2020; S. A. Khan et al., 2020). The virus belongs to the family known\nas \u2018coronaviruses\u2019 because of the crown-like appearance of spikes glycoproteins on the\nenvelope under an electron microscope (Y Chen et al., 2020). World health organization (WHO) recently announced that the virus\ntransforms from epidemic to pandemic, which requires urgent intervention to prevent the\ngrowing spread of the virus across the globe (Chan et al., 2020). The total confirmed cases 2,347,884 with 738,923 cases in the\nUnited State of America (USA) alone and the total death of 161,138 (as of April 19), with\nmortality estimated within 2% and about 3.4%, according to estimates of approved cases and\ndeath worldwide (N. Chen et al., 2020). The most\nfamiliar is a virus that arose from the Rhinolophus bat which is > 96% homologous with\nthe modern SARS-CoV-2 virus and it is just 79% homologous with the initial SARS-CoV (Fisher\n& Heymann, 2020). The fast-growing number of\ninfected cases globally urged the World Health Organization to announce a state of global\nhealth emergency to correlate scientific and medical disciplines to develop rapidly an\neffective treatment for patients, (Morse et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020) elderly\npatients and people with severe underlying health diseases like heart diseases, lung\nillness, and diabetic patients, for instance, appear to be at greater risk of revealing\nsevere SARS-CoV-2 requires immediate intervention rather than waiting virus vaccine which\nmay require 1 year to be available (Enayatkhani, 2020). While drug repurposing could be a short-term and fast resolution to handle\nSARS-CoV-2 patients (Elfiky, 2020; R. J. Khan et\nal., 2020; Kumar et al., 2019), repurposing\nexisting drugs can offer a good choice to overcome the virus and offer better risk-versus\ntrade-off as compared with discovering new drug and can help overcome time waiting for new\ntherapy rather than use the available resources (Elmezayen, 2020; Muralidharan, 2020)\nOne successful repurposing drug story includes duloxetine which originally developed for\ndepression and FDA approved as the first-in-class choice for stress urinary incontinence\n(Sweeney & Chancellor, 2005), duloxetine\ninitially created as antidepressant also is now passed to Phase III clinical trials as a\nfirst-in-class treatment for premature ejaculation (McMahon, 2012) and thalidomide, which had a tragic start as an\nover-the-counter sedative for morning sickness in pregnancy is now being applied to manage\nleprosy and multiple myeloma (Hideshima & Anderson, 2002).",

(2015) and some of the antiviral drugs\nthat can form a covalent bond to the target protein. And we aim also here to redirect them\nfor other indications specially to see their possibility to fight against SARS-CoV-2.\nThence, we searched about the chosen drugs in PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to identify the possibility of the\nselected drugs to be as covalent binders toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Where, PubChem provides\ndetailed information about the selected drugs rather than other repositories, especially,\nthe property of drug to form covalent bond. Before starting covalent docking, we\ndownloaded the selected drugs one by one and optimize them by using the Ligprep (Lim et\nal., 2020) based on the OPLS_2005 force field\nand generated possible state employing Epik in the Schrodinger 2020 (Elfiky 2020; S. A. Khan et al.,2020). In the next step,\nthe structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (6LU7) was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) (Jin et al. , 2020). The protease structure was optimized by adding hydrogens, removing water\nmolecules and optimizing charge using the Protein Preparation Wizard module (Kumalo et\nal., 2015) in Schrodinger suite 2020-1. The\ncovalent docking protocol was preferred since the cysteine 145 residue which is available\nin the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro considered as a vital residue that can form a\ncovalent bond with the drug if it can interact covalently. The different mechanisms for\nthe Cys145-FDA drug were mentioned in Table 1\nbased on the nature of the drug so that the reactive functional group on the ligand and\nreceptor residue are identified and the bond is formed between the correct atoms. These\ncovalently docked complexes were created using Covdock in Schrodinger suite 2020-1.\nFinally, we selected the lowest the MMGBSA value for each drug as a propriate conformation\nof the drug inside the binding pocket.",

Prior study that have referred to the significance of molecular docking\nto determine effective treatment in short time (Wu, et al., 2020). In reviewing the literature, we took the advantage of\npossibility of FDA available drugs that can be as a covalent warhead to inhibit the\nSARS-CoV-2 Mpro with Cys145. An initial objective of the project was to identify effective\nand applicable treatment. The present study focused on the main protease (Mpro), especially\nPDB ID (6LU7) as a potential target for several marketed drugs as possible therapeutic\noption to combat the virus to see the capability of these drugs to bind with the cysteine\n145 residue which is available in the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The Mpro in\nSARS-CoV-2 is necessary for the proteolytic maturation of the virus targeting this protein\nto limit the expansion of infection by hindering the cleavage of the viral polyprotein. The\nmost interesting finding was that the both saquinavir and ritonavir have the same affinity\n(binding energy MMGBSA \u2248 \u221272 kcal/mol) to block binding site of SARS-CoV-2 with irreversible\ninteractions. This study supports evidence from previous observations that\nlopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 (Lim et al., 2020). Another important outcome was that the remdesivir comes in second rank with\nbinding affinity (MMGBSA = \u221265 kcal/mol ). Whereas previous research has established that\nremdesivir can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M proenzyme through docking results. Another significant\nfinding, delavirdine computationally showed the ability to form irreversible covalent bond\nof \u221257.65 kcal/mol MMGBSA binding energy. Moreover, indinavir and cefuroxime axetil\nexhibited the possibility to halt the pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by forming stable\ninteraction through covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding (MMGBSA binding energies \u2248 \u221254\nKcal/mol). Furthermore, oseltamivir and prevacid exhibited same affinity to bind with\nSARS-CoV-2 protease through one covalent bond and one hydrogen bond (\u2248 \u221251 Kcal/mol), which\nis a good explanation for the activity of oseltamivir (Peeri et al., 2020). In this study, results obtained show the binding affinity of\ndrugs to an active site depends on several factors mainly the ability of a compound to form\na covalent bond with amino acid residues of the Mpro (Cys145) and length of a covalent bond,\nthe number of H-bonds that can form with a pocket of the active site and type of\nnucleophilic addition of unsaturated bonds. In this concept, the structural features in\nsaquinavir and ritonavir like free amine group (-NH2), hydroxyl groups (-OH), carbonyl\ngroups (C=O) in addition to ether group play key structural feature to form H-bond. Results\nshow the promising activities for antiretroviral drugs saquinavir that used for HIV/AIDS\nmore than ritonavir and remdesivir followed by lopinavir as the best drugs to bind\ncovalently toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with lowest energy of binding. As discussed above,\nsaquinavir, ritonavir, remdesivir, delavirdine, cefuroxime axetil, oseltamivir, and prevacid\nshowed the ability to block the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by forming covalent bond and\nstabilized with hydrogen bonding.",

An initial mission of the project was to identify rapid, effective, safe, and\navailable for large proportions of people, so we run covalent docking and MMGBSA to sift the\npossibility of these drug to form irreversible interactions. Therefore, we had chosen these\ndrugs because they carry covalent warheads that can bind covalently to the target. But the\ndocking results are not adequate, so we run MD simulations examine how much these drugs are\nable to form stable interactions with targeted protein. One interesting finding is the RMSD\nof protein backbone in apo status has higher average value, whereas the binding with top\nthree drugs diminished these RMSD average. Another important finding was that the RMSF of\nprotein\u2019s backbone be less flexible when it compared to apo form of SARS-CoV-2 main\nprotease. It is somewhat surprising that the binding of three drugs have not noted in Rg\nvalues. It is not yet clear whether the top three drugs can show an evidence to inhibit the\ntargeted protein, thereby we lean on the principal component analysis to analyze the MD\ntrajectories to judge without dispute. The most obvious finding to emerge from 2D PCA\nanalysis is that the binding of under investigated drugs caused stately impact on essential\ndynamics of protein by reducing its essential dynamics to its least possible motions. These\nresults seem to be consistent with RMSD results. A possible explanation for this might be\nthat binding of the drugs make the binding site much narrower due to hydrogen bindings this\nmakes the 3D structure of targeted protein more rigid so it will lose its biological\nfunctions. It is possible, therefore, that using these available drugs in two ways: either\nalone or in combined way. These findings suggest the possible use of nominated drugs against\nSARS-CoV-2 in short time as approved by covalent docking screening.
