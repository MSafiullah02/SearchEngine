As no permanent treatment has been found, social distancing, hand hygiene and rational usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) have come as most effective means to contain the virus. Face masks as part of PPE form an effective barrier between pathogen and health care workers (HCW). The WHO has published specific guidelines on use of masks in the context of COVID-19 1 . These mask are put on with elastic cord, or ribbon ties ( Figure 1 ). They are meant to contain droplet infection and prevent it from spreading. In present scenario several governments across the world have made use of masks compulsory in public places 2 and thus the need of masks is not restricted to HCW but too pertinent to general population. It demands these masks to be worn for long hours leading to a panorama of issues ranging from personal safety to health hazards. Literature suggests an appropriate modification of medical equipment for ease of use and safety. But, in demanding times like these in the pandemic, innovations bring in solutions which may find no place in print in good times. We propose an innovative use of cardboard cut-out to increase compliance and safety of masks. We believe this to be the first description of novel cardboard technique.",

Originally the masks were not devised to be worn all day, but now in wake of COVID-19 pandemic, duration of masks use has increased. Using mask has become both necessity and legal boundation 3 With cardboard cut-out as described, it distributes the pressure over the greater occipital region, reducing the irritation and friction over the ears and undue ear pull. This makes mask more convenient and lessen the risk of damage to ears and face (figure 5). It also makes the mask more snuggly fit with less air leak and offer better protection.",
