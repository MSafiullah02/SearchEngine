In ferrets, clinical signs are generally non\u2010specific and include diarrhoea, weight loss, lethargy, hyporexia and vomiting (Garner et al.\n2008, Murray et al.\n2010, Dominguez et al.\n2011). Central nervous system and respiratory signs are uncommonly reported (Garner et al.\n2008, Murray et al.\n2010). This case report describes the tomodensitometry and histopathological features of a ferret with a focal meningeal pyogranulomatous lesion associated with coronavirus infection.",

A 3\u2010month history of mild lethargy with intermittent diarrhoea was also reported. Abdominal ultrasonography performed 2 months earlier by the referring veterinarian revealed abnormalities interpreted as intestinal inflammation and pancreatitis without peritoneal effusion. The ferret was treated symptomatically for diarrhoea and with glucocorticoids (Prednisolone 1 mg/day) for the suspected inflammation. After a transient improvement, the ferret showed an acute deterioration of body condition and neurological signs. On clinical presentation, the ferret was cachectic and was presented in lateral recumbency. Neurological status examination revealed postural reaction deficits in all four limbs. Spinal reflexes were intact. Pain sensation was present. The ferret had a depressed mental status and responded to noxious and auditory stimuli. There was no seizure activity. Cranial nerves were not altered: palpebral reflexes and pupillary light reflexes were both normal. These findings were consistent with a forebrain lesion.",

The ferret was placed in sternal recumbency and 0 \u00b7 5\u2010mm slices were acquired (120 kV, 100 mA) then reconstruction in a low spatial resolution (soft tissue) algorithm and high spatial resolution (bone) algorithm, before and after IV administration of iodine (Telebrix 35, Sodium Ioxithalamate, corresponding to 700 mg Iodine/kg). Post\u2010contrast CT revealed a well\u2010delimited ovoid plaque\u2010like mass, with homogeneous contrast enhancement, extending from the rostral aspect of the olfactory bulb to the caudal aspect of the frontal lobe. The lesion appeared to be extraparenchymal, with a broad base against the bone, though an intraparenchymal location could not be excluded. The differential diagnosis included: extraparenchymal neoplasms (meningioma, lymphoma) and, less likely, intraparenchymal neoplasms (gliomas), inflammatory or infectious granuloma. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed, although the ferret was given glucocorticoids for 2 months; it revealed no pleocytosis (266 RBC/mm3, 2 lymphocytes/mm3). This result was more consistent with a neoplastic process, although an infectious disease (such as cryptococcosis) or an abscess could not be ruled out.",

The ferret was orally intubated and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen diluted. A transfrontal craniectomy was performed, following the same procedure reported for dogs (Greco et al.\n2006). This allowed an incomplete excision of an ill\u2010defined granular mass that appeared infiltrative within the cerebral parenchyma. Because the mass was not macroscopically consistent with a well\u2010delimited tumour as expected, and because the remainder of the cerebral parenchyma appeared abnormal and the ferret had stopped responding to medical treatment, the owners were informed of the poor prognosis and elected for euthanasia during the procedure. Complete post\u2010mortem examination was not permitted.",
