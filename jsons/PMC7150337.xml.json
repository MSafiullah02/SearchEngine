Transmission of rabies to humans follows bite, scratch and, far less often, inhalation of aerosolized saliva. Bats also account for many cases of rabies in livestock. Other Lyssaviruses that have been transmitted to humans from bats include European bat Lyssavirus-1, European bat Lyssavirus-2 and Australian bat Lyssavirus.18 Most recent reports of human rabies from bat exposure find no clear evidence of a documented bat bite. Transmission apparently occurs from inadvertent bites or from unrecognized contact with the bat saliva. This forms the rationale for the administration of rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine when a bat is found in the room upon awaking from sleep, in the room of a small child, or in the room of an intoxicated or mentally challenged person19 (see Chapter 171). However, given the large number of people (approximately 2.7 million with bedroom exposure and without a bite) who would have to be treated with rabies immune globulin and the rabies vaccine in order to prevent a single case of human rabies, this recommendation is controversial.20 As noted above, bats have been found to be reservoirs of the zoonotic paramyxoviruses Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Menangle virus.21 In addition, after decades of active research, bats have been identified as the reservoirs of both Ebola virus22 and Marburg virus.23\n",

In the USA and Canada, the viruses include Sin Nombre virus, the main cause of HPS, transmitted by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and other less common rodent-borne hantaviruses. In South America, viruses include Andes virus in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay transmitted by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), a virus for which there is epidemiologic evidence of person-to-person transmission; Juquitiba virus in Brazil; Laguna Negra virus in Paraguay, transmitted by the vesper mouse (Calomys laucha); and Bermejo virus in Bolivia. Additional hantaviruses have been discovered as well. Hantaviruses that are associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Europe and Asia include Hantaan virus, transmitted by the murine field mouse (Apodemus agrarius); Dobrava virus transmitted by the murine field mouse (Apodemus flavicollis); Seoul virus, transmitted by the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Asia; and Puumala virus transmitted by the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus).39\n",
