Specific PPE recommendations when caring for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection include:a) Respirator or facemask: As ultrasound practitioners are in close contact with patients, surgical facemasks are essential to offer protection. These must be put on before entry into the patient room or care area. N95 respirators or respirators that offer a higher level of protection should be used instead of a facemask when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedure, particularly for use in the intensive care unit. It is important to perform hand hygiene after removal of the respirator or facemask.b)Eye protection (for ultrasound practitioners in the critical care setting): This includes goggles or a disposable face shield that must be put on when entering the patient room or care area. Reusable eye protection (e.g., goggles) must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer's reprocessing instructions prior to re-use. Disposable eye protection should be discarded after use. An individual risk assessment should be carried out prior to/at the time of providing care to the patient.",

More recently, specific guidance documents for COVID-19 have also been published on various websites (for instance ISUOG).

Disinfection methods include manual and automated systems which can be either chemical or light based. Rinse the end of the transducer with tap water to remove any residual gel or debris d.Clean the transducer with a damp gauze pad or other soft cloth and a small amount of mild nonabrasive liquid soap (approved for use on medical instruments) to thoroughly cleanse the transducer. Consider the use of a small brush especially for the crevices and areas of angulation depending on the design of your particular transducer.
