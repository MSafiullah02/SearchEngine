(ii) How many human proteins harbor viral peptide modules? The two questions are of paramount importance in the context of autoimmune diseases. Indeed, it is a common belief that an autoimmune reaction is mostly caused by a host receiving an antigen that has amino acid homology/similarity with amino acid sequences in self-antigens of the host [20]. This may result in the host immune system attacking the organs and tissues expressing the self-antigens with the shared sequences [23]. In this context and given the sustained increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases [2], [8], [18], [22], the mathematical quantification of peptide overlap extent between viruses and humans is essential to understand the role of structural viral similarity in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity. Here we report a virus versus human comparative screening that reveals a massive, indiscriminate, unexpected pentapeptide overlapping between viral and human proteomes.",

More precisely, for each viral proteome size, we constructed an artificial human sub-proteome drawn from the human protein set. The proteins were selected at random without replacement, and assigned to an artificial sub-proteome at random. We kept adding human proteins to each artificial human sub-proteome until adding the next protein would have caused the total number of amino acids in the artificial sub-proteome to exceed to the number of amino acids in the corresponding viral proteome. This way we eliminated possible bias in the comparison. The 30 artificial sub-proteomes are random samplings of human proteins and represent cross-sections of all human proteins.

The scans were performed by custom programs written in C and utilizing suffix trees for efficiency [6]. The viral or human proteins were manipulated and analyzed as follows. The entire viral (or human) proteome was decomposed in silico to a set of 5-mers (including all duplicates). A library of unique 5-mers for each virus or human proteome was then created by removing duplicates. Next, for each 5-mer in the library, the entire human proteome was searched for instances of the same 5-mer. Any such occurrence was termed an overlap. Cursory analyses (e.g. identification of unique overlapping 5-mers, counts of unique overlapping 5-mers, counts of duplications) were performed using LINIX/UNIX shell scripts and standard LINUX/UNIX utilities. Data were plotted and linear least-squares regression was performed to determine whether any linear relationships exist between the level of overlap and the size of viral (or control) proteomes. The same procedure was applied when longer amino acid sequences (esa-, epta-, octapeptides, etc.) were used as probes in the similarity analyses.",

The overlapping extent (in terms of percentage of unique viral 5-mers which occur in the human proteome, see column 6 in Table 4) is rarely less than 90%. That means that almost 90% of the viral pentamer peptides are widely, intensively and repeatedly scattered throughout the human proteome. Numerically, the viral versus human overlap is defined by 2,907,096 total matches. Also the viral overlapping distribution in the human proteome (as number of human proteins hosting viral 5-mers, column 5 in Table 4) is highest, being close to 100% with HHV-5 (i.e. HHV-5 pentamers are present in 35,708 human proteins out of the 36,103 ones which comprehensively form the human proteome).",

When 30 human artificial sub-proteomes were analyzed for pentapeptide overlapping to the entire human proteome, we obtained clear numerical evidence that the inter-human level of perfect 5-mer matching is of the same order of magnitude as the viral overlapping to human proteome detailed in Table 4, i.e. there are 3,713,010 inter-human versus 2,907,096 viral perfect 5-mer matches to the human proteome (see Table 5). Likewise, the number of human proteins involved in viral and inter-human overlaps is highest and practically identical in the numbers: human proteins are involved in the inter-human peptide overlapping for 697,373 times and in the viral versus human overlap for 633,229 times (see data from Table 4, Table 5, respectively).

The following observations are worth noting: first, the level of viral overlaps to the human proteome is directly related to the length of the viral proteome by a linear relationship. The Pearson's correlation coefficient of the line is 0.97452, and represents an exceptionally strong linear relationship. Biologically, Fig. 1 suggests that peptide motif sharing is a constant property of the viral proteomes, exclusively depending on the viral proteome length and with no relationship to other structural and/or pathogenic viral features. As a note of interest, it can be seen that HTLV-1, Rubella virus, and HCV present a number of overlaps to the human proteome above the expected number of overlaps predicted by the linear regression line. This indicates that the massive, repeated, acritical, usage of the same pentapeptide blocks in viral and human proteomes is even more accentuated in the case of HTLV-1, Rubella virus, and HCV.",

As an example, in face of the possible 3,200,000 pentamers, both the 30 viral proteomes and the 30 human sub-proteomes present a high degree of repetitiveness in their 5-mer composition.

For example, notwithstanding the astonishingly great repertoire of theoretical possible undecapeptides (that is: 204,800,000 millions), nonetheless eight viral overlaps (one of which even repeated) are present in the sub-proteomic human samples.

Rather, powerful constraints appear to be at work by forcing the use of restricted platforms of n-mers and privileging the repeated usage of the chosen ones. Possibly, as anticipated by preliminary data from our labs (Kusalik et al., manuscript in preparation), these powerful constraints able to influence and favor specific n-mer synthesis might be found among physico-chemical factors such as hydrophobicity, residue bulkiness, \u0394G\u00b0 of peptide bond formation, plus biological factors such as codon bias.",

Likewise, the antigen-antibody recognition process can reductionistically be circumscribed to interacting modules of five amino acid residues which, therefore, appear to be sufficient structural immunological determinants ([11], [12], [13], [17] and Refs. therein). Consequently, we notice that the data shown here call into question the possibility of a direct causal association between virus\u2013host sharing of amino acid motifs and incitement of autoimmune reactions [20]. Indeed, the molecular mimicry hypothesis suggests that, when bacterial/viral agents share epitopes with a host's proteins, an immune response against the infectious agent may result in formation of cross-reacting antibodies that bind the shared epitopes on the normal cell and result in the auto-destruction of the cell. In the present case, the molecular mimicry hypothesis implies that viral infections should be a practically infinite source of autoimmunity diseases since this study demonstrates that viral 5-mer matches are disseminated throughout practically all the human proteome and each viral match is repeated almost more than 10 times (see Table 4). Consequently, autoimmune diseases should theoretically approach a 100% real incidence, since the 30 viruses we examined practically are more or less disseminated throughout the entire human species. Taking HCV as an example, we note that the virus versus human overlap analysis in Table 4 produces the mathematical evidence that HCV (as well as HTLV-1 and Rubella virus) are even \u201cmore similar\u201d to the human proteins than that expected by the linear regression relationship reported in Fig. 3. The data reinforce and add to our previous report on the sharing of numerous perfect exact matches between HCV and human proteomes [16]. Since 2760 out of 3003 HCV 5-mers occur in the human proteome, the 46,731 occurrences include multiple/repeated matches in the human proteins. More exactly, each HCV 5-mer that overlaps with the human proteome are repeated an average of 16.5 times. Moreover, the 46,731 occurrences occur in 20,269 different human proteins (Table 4). That means that almost 60% of the 36,103 human proteins forming the H. sapiens proteome contain viral HCV pentamers. This datum is of cogent interest in the present worldwide advance of HCV infection, since it further excludes sequence similarity as a possible mechanism in HCV-associated autoimmunity phenomena and, at the same time, might address research towards new unexplored scenarios. These observations, of course, apply to almost all the viruses listed in Table 1.",
