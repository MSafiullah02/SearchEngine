This novel virus is genetically similar to bat coronaviruses, and shares about 79% and 50% of its genetic sequence with the coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), respectively.4 Although epidemiological evidence suggests most of the initial patients were exposed to the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the animal source of COVID-19 has not yet been identified.1 Human-to-human transmission is now responsible for most new infections, including those among family members and health care workers.5, 6, 7\n",

We assessed the eligibility of 214 full-text papers, of which 99 did not report original data, 47 did not report clinical features of COVID-19 (e.g., epidemiological characteristics, mathematical models, virus structure), six did not include clear diagnostic criteria, 17 had a sample size smaller than four, two were conducted outside mainland China, and one focused on patients aged less than one year. After excluding these studies, 43 eligible studies with 3600 patients were included. Among included studies, one study only reported data on critically ill patients and was excluded from the overall meta-analysis but was included in the meta-analysis restricted to patients with severe illness.1\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50\n",

The earliest enrollment time was 16 December 2019 and the latest was 27 January 2020. One publication was a letter, and the remainder were journal articles. Most included studies were retrospective case series (40 [90.3%]), 27 (62.8%) were from cities outside Wuhan, and 34 (79.0%) only included patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The number of patients enrolled in each study ranged from 4 to 1099. Mean or median age of patients varied from 39 to 72 years (median 41 years; 43 studies). The proportion of male patients ranged from 29.0% to 77.0% (median 56.5%; 42 studies). The proportion of patients who had ever traveled to or were resident of Hubei Province varied from 28.5% to 100.0% (median 91.0%; 36 studies). The number of family-clusters ranged from 1 to 5 (10 studies). The proportion of patients who were current smokers ranged from 0.0% to 18.0% (median 7.2%; 9 studies), and health workers ranged from 0.0% to 29.0% (median 4.0%; 5 studies). The proportion of patients with hypertension ranged from 0.0% to 48.0% (median 16.0%;27 studies), diabetes ranged from 0.0% to 50.0% (median 10.1%; 26 studies), cancer ranged from 0.0% to 17.0% (median 1.0%; 15 studies), chronic respiratory/lung diseases ranged from 0.0% to 17.0% (median 2.0%; 16 studies), having any coexisting medical comorbidity ranged from 12.0% to 67.0%. The proportion of patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 varied from 0.0% to 100.0% (median 26.5%; 21 studies), and the most commonly used diagnostic criteria was The Guidelines on 2019-nCoV Treatment and Prevention issued by the NHC (70.6) (17 studies). 9 (20.9%) of 43 studies were rated as low risk of bias, 30 studies (69.8%) as moderate, and all remaining studies rated as high risk of bias (supplementary Table 1).",

Fever (83.3% [95% CI 78.4\u201387.7]), cough (60.3% [54.2\u201366.3]), and fatigue (38.0% [29.8\u201346.5]) were the most common, followed by increased sputum production, shortness of breath, and myalgia, with estimated prevalence just under 30% for each, respectively. Eleven studies reported the proportion of COVID-19 patients who did not exhibit obvious symptoms, and the pooled estimated prevalence was 5.6% (1.4-11.6). Among 16 commonly reported laboratory findings (figure 3\n), the most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (68.6% [58.2\u201378.2]) and decreased lymphocyte count (57.4% [44.8\u201369.5]), as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase (51.6% [31.4\u201371.6]). Ground-glass opacities (80.0% [67.3\u201390.4]) and bilateral pneumonia (73.2% [63.4\u201382.1]) and were the most frequent chest CT findings (figure 3). The vast majority of patients received antiviral therapy (90.0% 74.1\u201399.0]), antibiotic treatment (71.5% [50.0\u201389.7]), and oxygen therapy (71\u20225% [28\u20220\u201399\u20227]). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication (15.7% [5.0\u201330.4]). The overall estimated prevalence of severe case and death was 25.6% (17.4\u201334.9) and 3.6% (1.1\u20137.2), respectively (figure 4\n).",

When evaluating suspected cases, physicians cannot rely on these laboratory abnormalities to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19. These abnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with SARS and MERS.57, 58, 59 Previous research suggests these abnormalities may be related to the cytokine storm brought on by infection.22 Recently, a study suggested that COVID-19 may primarily affect T lymphocytes, especially CD4+ T cells, resulting in significant lymphopenia as well as decreased IFN- \u03b3 production.60 Additionally, by using a multiple linear regression model, a study showed that CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients\u2019 stools (p=0\u2022010).61 However, the number of cases currently reported is too small to draw firm conclusions, and further studies are required. The most frequently reported finding on CT imaging was ground-glass opacities, particularly bilateral opacities impacting three or more lobes.

This is consistent with a single-center retrospective study found that older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS were at increased risk of death.45 A multivariate Cox regression analysis results showed age and severe cases were identified as independent prognostic factors for virus clearance.62 Furthermore, a study showed that children might be less likely to become infected or, if infected, may show milder symptoms.16 Another study also confirmed that the elderly and those with comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, liver diseases, malignancy were more likely to develop critical illness (62.1%:25.0%, p<0.001).62\n",

They mistake incidence for prevalence and odds ratio for proportion. They demonstrate the proportion of severe cases is 88% and case fatality rate is 42% in figures, which are misleading. PRISMA guidelines and test for heterogeneity were not mentioned. Authors state in Methods that \u201cOnly available data from published articles were collected. Data from unpublished papers were not included.\u201d However 4 out of 10 references were from Medrxiv, a platform that publishes non-peer reviewed reports. These reports, as it clearly states on Medrxiv's website, should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported as established information. One reference providing 4021 cases was already withdrawn from publication.66 It is inappropriate to include the China CDC report providing epidemiological characteristics of 44672 cases of COVID-19 (as of February 11, 2020) in a meta-analysis of its clinical characteristics.10 This report, based on national surveillance data, provides epidemiological data only, including spatiotemporal distribution. Albeit this report includes a large sample, data on clinical symptoms that are not systematically reported, may not be reliable. For example, 53% did not report if they have co-morbidity or not. 9 out 10 studies included in the meta-analysis were published/submitted before February 11, 2020 so cases in these 9 studies must have already been included in the China CDC report. It is inappropriate to count an individual twice. After excluding the China CDC report and the four preprint articles, only 369 patients would be reportable in that review. Authors did not list specific imaging performance in abnormal imaging, nor did they list pulmonary fibrosis and its incidence. However in Discussion they use two lengthy paragraphs to explain the content of pulmonary fibrosis, which may cause readers to mistakenly believe that the imaging abnormality is pulmonary fibrosis. Author failed to report any clinical laboratory findings and treatments of COVID-19 which are essential to a thorough understanding of clinical characteristics. They also failed to report the diagnostic criteria for abnormal chest CT detection and severe cases.",
