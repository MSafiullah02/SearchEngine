To study the functions of the S protein, we describe here the generation of SARS-CoV S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype using a VSV\u232cG*/GFP system in which the G gene is replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (VSV-SARS-CoV-St19/GFP). Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-CoV-St19) allowed efficient incorporation into the VSV particle that enabled the generation of a high titer of pseudotype virus. Neutralization assay with anti-SARS-CoV antibody revealed that VSV-SARS-St19/GFP pseudotype infection is mediated by SARS-CoV S protein. The VSV\u232cG*/SEAP system, which secretes alkaline phosphatase instead of GFP, was also generated as a VSV pseudotype having SARS-CoV S protein (VSV-SARS-CoV-St19/SEAP). This system enabled high-throughput analysis of SARS-CoV S protein-mediated cell entry by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity. Thus, VSV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein is useful for developing a rapid detection system for neutralizing antibody specific for SARS-CoV infection as well as studying the S-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV.",

Studies on SARS using infectious SARS-CoV require care because of the highly pathogenic nature of this virus, so an alternative methodology is needed. Recently, pseudotyped retrovirus particles bearing SARS-CoV S protein have been generated by several laboratories (2-4) . These pseudotyped viruses have been shown to have a cell tropism identical to authentic SARS-CoV and their infectivity is dependent on ACE2, indicating that the infection is mediated solely by SARS-CoV S protein. Pseudotyped viruses have proved to be a safe viral entry model because of an inability to produce infectious progeny virus. A quantitative assay of pseudovirus infection could facilitate the research on SARS-CoV entry, cell tropism, and neutralization antibody.",

This system (VSV\u232cG*/GFP system) may be useful for research on envelope glycoprotein owing to its ability to grow high titers in a variety of cell lines. The pseudotype virus titer obtained from the VSV\u232cG*/GFP system (>10 5 infectious units (IU)/ml) is generally higher than that of the pseudotyped retrovirus system (6). Furthermore, infection of pseudotyped VSV in target cells can be detected as GFP-positive cells within 16 h postinfection (hpi) because of the powerful GFP-expression in the VSV\u232cG*/GFP system (6). In contrast, the time required for the pseudotyped retrovirus system to detect infection is 48 hpi (9,10), which is similar to that for the SARS-CoV to replicate to the level of producing plaques or cytopathic effects on infected cells. Thus, pseudotyping of SARS-CoV S protein using the VSV\u232cG*/GFP system may have greater advantages than retrovirus pseudotypes for studying the function of SARS-CoV S protein as well as for developing a rapid system for detection of neutralizing antibody specific for SARS-CoV.",

The following methods were originally designed to produce VSV-SARS-St19/GFP and to measure the infection efficiency. In addition to a significant advantage of the VSV-SARS-St19/GFP for safe and rapid analyses of infection, the VSV\u232cG*/SEAP system, in which the G gene is replaced with the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene, may be superior to high-throughput quantitative analysis of S-mediated cell entry.

Whitt (University of Tennessee Health Science Center, TN), ask him for sharing and using the system when starting experiments. 3. As the SEAP gene is obtained by modification of human placental alkaline phosphatase gene, some cell lines derived from placenta that express alkaline phosphatase similar to SEAP should not be used as target cells. For the analysis of VSV-SARS-St19/SEAP infection, we suggest using Vero E6 cells that show a very low level of alkaline phosphatase activity in the culture supernatant. 4. The medium containing VSV-SARS-St19/SEAP may have strong SEAP activity since it is derived from culture medium of 293T cells inoculated VSV\u232cG*/ SEAP-G (see steps 3-6 in Section 3.1).
