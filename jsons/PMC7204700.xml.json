Frequently used medicines to treat some of these symptoms include opioids such as morphine, fentanyl and midazolam. Recent reported data indicate that the median-maximum dose/24h for patients with confirmed COVID-19 referred to hospital palliative care are morphine, 10-30mg; fentanyl, 100-200mcg; alfentanil 500-1000 mcg and for midazolam, 10-20mg. (12) Symptom control for rising cohorts of COVID-19 and other palliative care patients in countries with low or no access to ICEMs will be seriously compromised. Major hospitals in the US and nine university hospitals in Europe have recently reported dangerous shortages of ICEMs and have requested governments to increase procurement. (13, 14) Several US medical associations sent an urgent letter to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reporting that the increase in the number of patients requiring ventilation has resulted in an increase in the demand for several opioids, some of which were already in shortage prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. (15) They request that supply be rapidly increased to ensure that hospitals can access the medications they need to treat COVID-19 patients. In addition, public health experts and physicians recently asked the governors of US states that still practice the death penalty to release their stockpiled drugs in order to prioritize the needs and lives of patients (14). And in the UK, the National Health Service is reportedly working to increase stocks while at the same time facing many challenges. (17)",

These include ensuring the maintenance of sufficient buffer stocks and using simplified control procedures for the export, transportation and provision of ICEMs. .2.We urge palliative care associations to consider recommending their national competent authorities to utilize pooled procurement mechanisms such as the Pan American Health Organization Strategic Fund, the Pharmaceutical Procurement Service in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Gulf Corporation Council, and UNICEF and to resupply and build buffer stocks, as the markets will take advantage of increased demand to raise prices.3.The Lancet Commission on Pain and Palliative Care developed and costed an Essential Package that is the minimum a health system, however resource-constrained, should make universally accessible. The Essential Package includes medications for safe and effective palliative care and pain relief for both adults and children largely based on the WHO Model List. Its medicines and equipment, including morphine and diazepam, can all be safely prescribed or administered in a primary care setting where health professionals have received basic training in palliative care.4.As many frontline health workers will be unfamiliar with the use of opioids and benzodiazepines in the context of the pandemic, we recommend accelerated clinician training, including online, for COVID-19 related symptom control. Training specialist nurses to prescribe and deliver opioids to palliative care patients in all home care settings (as in Uganda and Rwanda) aligns with WHO calls to invest in nurses in this International Year of the Nurse and Midwife.\n",

Global health experts describe lack of access to essential palliative care medicines as a critical public health issues, and opioids, in particular morphine, as essential for the relief of severe health-related suffering. The additional COVID-19 burden of health-related suffering only underscores the government obligation to take a balanced approach to the regulation of internationally controlled substances, and to make strategic interventions, in partnership with clinical associations, to ensure the availability, accessibility, and affordability of essential medicines for primary, intensive, and palliative care.
