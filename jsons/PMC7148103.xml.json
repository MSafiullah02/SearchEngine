In particular, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) witnessed the development of ACL Anthology since the year 2001, which curates papers (in PDF format) from more than 70 NLP venues including popular conferences like ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, etc. In the year 2008, Bird et al. [2] released the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ACL ARC), consisting of OCRed extracted text and metadata of PDF articles. In the year 2009, Radev et al. [8] developed ACL Anthology Network (AAN) by manually constructing paper citation, author citation and author collaboration network, along with other interesting statistics and citation summaries of the articles. The recently updated AAN system [9] indexes articles published till 2014. Another initiative, ACL Anthology SearchBench [10], provides bibliographic metadata filtering and full-text structured semantic search in ACL Anthology. CL Scholar [12] periodically crawls ACL Anthology and constructs a computational linguistic knowledge graph. It supports natural language queries and entity specific queries about the authors, venue, and paper. Almost all systems described above are either in dormant condition [2, 8\u201310] or not available [12].",

Figure 1 presents the detailed description of the architecture. The data acquisition module periodically curates newly added semi-structured information such as metadata and the corresponding PDF articles from ACL Anthology. It leverages OCR++ [11] tool to extract structural and bibliographical information from each of the PDF articles, and then passes the metadata, structural and bibliographical information to the storage and query processing module. The storage and query processing module indexes the periodical updates into MongoDB [5] database and Elasticsearch [3] engine. MongoDB database handles the basic storage and retrieval, whereas Elasticsearch supports full-text based query search and ranking. The third module, the user interface, fetches processed search results from the storage and query processing module. The user interface is designed using Python\u2019s Flask library, and JavaScript libraries Plotly [7] and Timeline [13] are used to render statistics and graphical components of the interface.\n",

The search can be chosen to output results to any of the following domains - authors, papers, venues, URLs, and field of study. We also extend full-text search of articles in order to visualise n-gram trends over the period of time.Paper statistics: We provide standard paper related statistics such as the publication year and venue, author information, citation distribution over the years and the link to the corresponding PDF article. Additionally, we provide interesting insights like similar papers, topical distribution and mentioned URLs. We also provide statistics such as the list of popular recent papers, popular survey papers, seminal papers, papers with diverse topics, and publication count of last five years.Author statistics: We provide author statistics such as publication and citation distribution over the years, topical distribution of papers and venue preference. Additionally, we provide the list of popular recent authors, popular authors in the lifetime of ACL Anthology, authors with top publication counts, recent authors with high publication counts, and highly diverse authors.Field of study statistics: We curate a comprehensive list of topics categorized into five broad categories, (i) Linguistic Targets (Syntax, Discourse, Pragmatics, etc.), (ii) Tasks (Tagging, Summarization, Chunking, etc.), (iii) Approaches (unsupervised, supervised, etc.), (iv) Languages (English, Chinese, Hindi, etc.), and (v) Dataset Types (news, clinical notes, etc.).  NLPExplorer provides interesting insights such as the temporal distribution of papers and authors in each topic and subtopics, distribution of papers in each conference, and a timeline to visualize the introduction of new topics. We make the list of topics and the processed data of the system available at the systems\u2019 webpage [6].Venue statistics: Venue-related statistics include temporal distribution of publications and citations, topical distribution, and the list of papers in a year. We also include insights such as the top NLP venues citing and cited by the candidate venue, popular authors publishing in the candidate venue, and the shift in topical distribution over the years.URL statistics: We analyse URLs reported in the research papers. The URL-related statistics include top URLs in different categories such as universities, digital libraries, datasets and research groups, alongwith the analysis of top-level domains (TLDs) and corresponding sub-domains. Additionally, NLPExplorer provides year-wise usage distribution, total usage, and the list of top-most subdomains and associated papers.\n",
