            "text": "Highly contagious pustular skin infections of sheep, goats and cattle that were unwittingly transmitted to humans from close contact with infected animals, have been the scourge of shepherds, herdsmen and dairy farmers for centuries. In more recent times we recognise that these proliferative pustular lesions are likely to be caused by a group of zoonotic viruses that are classified as parapoxviruses. In addition to infecting the above ungulates, parapoxviruses have more recently been isolated from seals, camels, red deer and reindeer and most have been shown to infect man. The parapoxviruses have one of the smallest genomes of the poxvirus family (140 kb) yet share over 70% of their genes with the most virulent members. Like other poxviruses, the central core of the genomes encode factors for virus transcription and replication, and structural proteins, whereas the terminal regions encode accessory factors that give the parapoxvirus group many of its unique features. Several genes of parapoxviruses are unique to this genus and encode factors that target inflammation, the innate immune responses and the development of acquired immunity. These factors include a homologue of mammalian interleukin (IL)-10, a chemokine binding protein and a granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor /IL-2 binding protein. The ability of this group to reinfect their hosts, even though a cell-mediated memory response is induced during primary infection, may be related to their epitheliotropic niche and the immunomodulators they produce. In this highly localised environment, the secreted immunomodulators only interfere with the local immune response and thus do not compromise the host's immune system. The discovery of a vascular endothelial growth factor-like gene may explain the highly vascular nature of parapoxvirus lesions. There are many genes of parapoxviruses which do not encode polypeptides with significant matches with protein sequences in public databases, separating this genus from most other mammalian poxviruses. These genes appear to be involved in inhibiting apoptosis, manipulating cell cycle progression and degradation of cellular proteins that may be involved in the stress response, thus allowing the virus to subvert intracellular antiviral mechanisms and enhance the availability of cellular molecules required for replication. Parapoxviruses in common with Molluscum contagiosum virus lack a number of genes that are highly conserved in other poxviruses, including factors for nucleotide metabolism, serine protease inhibitors and kelch-like proteins. It is apparent that parapoxviruses have evolved a unique repertoire of genes that have allowed adaptation to the highly specialised environment of the epidermis.",

            "text": "The classification of the parapoxviruses has evolved slowly and there has been much confusion over the nomenclature used [1] . Members of the genus of the Chordopoxvirus subfamily that we now call the parapoxviruses, although having long been recognised as causing poxvirus-like disease, were not classified as poxviruses until 1956 [2] . At this time the members were few and included pustular dermatitis of sheep and goats and milkers nodes. In 1964, three viruses we now recognise as parapoxviruses,were listed as Group II poxviruses in \"Viruses of Vertebrates\" by Andrews 1964 [3] . Here the diseases of orf (synonyms: contagious pustular dermatitis, contagious ecthyma of sheep, sore mouth, scabby mouth, contagious pustular stomatitis; infectious labial dermatitis), milkers nodes (synonyms: pseudocowpox, paravaccinia), and stomatitis papulosa (of cattle) were included. The viruses associated with these diseases had a similar morphology and the \"ball of yarn\" appearance was described. The classification of the above as a distinct group within the poxviruses was described by the International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses in 1971 but in addition to bovine papular dermatitis virus, milkers nodes and orf, the group also included chamois contagious ecthyma virus [4] . In 1976, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) introduced the scheme of genera within families of viruses and here the subgroup became the Parapoxvirus genus within the family Poxviridae [5] . The genus was described as viruses of ungulates that infect man and Orf virus (ORFV) was chosen as the type species. The ICTV classification of the parapoxvirus genus now includes ORFV (syn. contagious pustular dermatitis virus and contagious ecthyma virus), Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) [syn bovine papular (pustular) stomatitis virus], Pseudocowpox virus (PCPV) (syn milker's nodule virus, paravaccinia virus) and the more recent member, Parapoxvirus of red deer in New Zealand (PVNZ) [6] . Tentative species of the genus include seal parapoxvirus, parapoxvirus of camels (contagious ecthyma of camels or Ausdyk disease), and chamois contagious ecthyma virus. A poxvirus able to cause fatal disease in red squirrels was initially considered a possible parapoxvirus, largely on the basis of its virion morphology. More recent DNA sequence data indicate that this virus is not a parapoxvirus and it remains an unclassified poxvirus [7] .",

Contagious pustular dermatitis or ORFV was first described in 1787, although shepherds have long recognised scabby disease of sheep [8] . However, it was another 100 years before the contagious nature of ORFV was recognised [9] and the susceptibility of humans to infection was reported [10] . In 1923, it was reported that the disease could be transmitted between sheep, by an agent that was smaller than most bacteria and could be included in the group of \"filterable\" viruses [11] . Aynaud also demonstrated that ORFV could be distinguished from Vaccinia virus (VACV) in that it did not cross-protect and he described the natural disease, its histological appearance, the susceptibility of the virus to solvents and chemicals, the development and duration of immunity, the lack of protection afforded by passive transfer of serum and the development of a vaccine which was live unattenuated ORFV. Today the vaccine against ORFV is still live unattenuated ORFV but it is commonly propagated in cell culture.",

In a review of the early literature Bonnevie [12] recognised that some smallpox vaccinations called \"vaccine rouge\" produced forms of lesions different from that caused by true cowpox and that vaccination material from these lesions did not protect from cowpox. Such infections were called false cowpox, paravaccine, milkers warts and milkers nodules and did not protect against smallpox. Lipschutz referred to the disease in humans as paravaccinia and along with others could distinguish the agent of milkers nodules from that causing cowpox by the application of the Pauls test, which involved the inoculation of the infectious material onto the cornea of rabbits [13] . Unlike cowpox, milkers nodules did not produce a lesion. In 1963, the virus was isolated in cell cultures from teat lesions in cattle and from milkers nodules and the virions were shown by electron microscopy to resemble those of ORFV and BPSV.",

Sporadic outbreaks have been reported since [38] . More recently, parapoxvirus infections of reindeer have been reported in semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway [37] . It has been shown that the parapoxvirus infections in Norway were likely caused by ORFV [49] . Genomic comparisons of one standard ORFV strain NZ2 (ORFV NZ2 ) and the reindeer isolates, employing restriction fragment length polymorphism, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and partial DNA sequencing of specific genes demonstrated high similarity between the reindeer viruses and known ORFV strains. It has been suggested that the virus may have been transferred from sheep and goats to reindeer via people, equipment and common use of pastures and corrals. Analysis of the viruses recovered from reindeer in Finland suggest that one disease outbreak was caused by ORFV and another by PCPV [38] .",

The first report appeared in 1969 and described the infection of Californian sea lions (Zaophus californianus) [26] . Since this time infections attributed to parapoxviruses have been reported in South American sea lions (Otaria bryonia) [25] , harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in the German North sea [27, 28] , Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) [29] , grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) around the coast of Cornwall [30] and other parts of the world [31, 32] and the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Queen Maud Land Antarctica [33] . Early reports were generally confined to observations of the histopathology of the lesions and electron microscopy of the virus particles. More recent reports have included in situ hybridisation with parapoxvirus-specific DNA probes and sequence analysis of PCR products. The emerging picture is that the viruses infecting pinnipeds are likely to form one or more new species within the Parapoxvirus genus, although the separation between pinnipeds and the currently recognized hosts for parapoxviruses (ungulates) introduces a note of caution.",

The infection begins as reddening and swelling around the sites of inoculation and small vesicles develop within 24 h. The lesions take on a pustular appearance as they develop. The pustular nature of the lesions is due to a large infiltration of polymorphonucleocytes. Adjacent lesions may coalesce as the disease progresses eventually forming a scab. Underlying the scabby lesions, the dermis becomes oedematous and proliferative, which gives a granulomatous appearance to the lesion. The lifting and cracking of scabs can result in the discharge of blood. Usually the resolution of the lesions takes up to 4-6 weeks, but there have been cases of persistent infection of ORFV in East Friesian sheep in New Zealand in which large tumour-like growths have developed (unpublished observation) and a report of a severe long-lasting contagious ecthyma in a goat's kid that lasted for 6 months [51] .",

The infected epidermis is characterised by vacuolation and swelling of keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum, reticular degeneration, marked epidermal proliferation, intra-epidermal microabscesses and accumulation of scale-crust. Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies may be visible in ballooning keratinocytes 72 h after infection. Epidermal proliferation leads to markedly elongated rete pegs. Neutrophils migrate into areas of reticular degeneration and form microabscesses that subsequently rupture on the surface. A thick layer of scale crust is built up, composed of hyperkeratosis, proteinaceous fluid, degenerating neutrophils, cellular debris and bacteria. Dermal lesions include oedema, marked capillary dilation and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Papillomatous growths that consist of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and granuloma formation often develop in natural ORFV infections and may become extensive [40] .",

            "text": "Human infection by PVNZ has yet to be reported. Milkers nodules and ORFV infections of humans have been noted for centuries. The virus often infects the hands of people coming in close contact with infected animals. ORFV lesions are relatively common in people working in the sheep industry; however, recently it has been reported that ORFV infections coincided with the Islamic practice \"feast of sacrifice\" in which sheep are manipulated for slaughter with bare hands [58] . Unlike the lesions of animals they remain localised as foci of infection. The progression of the disease caused by ORFV from infection to resolution has been divided into six stages [1, 59] . A maculopapular stage (days 1-7), which is characterised by vacuolisation of the cells of the upper epidermis; a target stage (days 7-14) macroscopically having a red centre surrounded by a white ring of maculopapular stage cells, which is further surrounded by a red halo of inflammation; an acute stage (days [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] where the epidermis has disappeared, and in some areas hair follicles are dilated and full of pycnotic cells; a regenerative stage (days [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] where the epithelium is regenerating; a papilloma stage (days 28-35) characterised by a raised epidermal lesion with finger-like projections of epidermis extending down into the dermis; and a regressive phase (after 35 days) in which the skin returns to its normal thickness and appearance, often without scarring. The appearance of milkers' nodules are similar, with lesions beginning as reddish purple, raised nodules turning bullous or pustular, and surrounded by a red halo of inflammation. The lesions resolve in 5-6 weeks [60] . Parapoxvirus infections reported in handlers of reindeer and musk-oxen in Norway are markedly granulomatous and, unlike orf and milkers nodules, may take many months to heal [61] . More serious complications of orf in humans are large highly vascularised tumour-like lesions of the skin. These tumour-like lesions have been noted in immunocompromised people [62, 63] , but have also been seen in people with apparently normal immune systems. ORFV infections can cause complications such as erythema multiforme reactions and in these cases individuals present with rashes on the backs of hands, legs and ankles [64] [65] [66] [67] . Cases of severe forms of erythema multiforma, known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported and involve rashes on mucous membranes and skin [68] . In immune-impaired individuals severe progressive disease can develop and cases have been reported presenting with multiple lesions [69] . The apparently successful use of cidofovir to treat a giant non-resolving ORFV lesion in an immunocompromised patient has been reported [70] . Immunity against ORFV is short lived and both animals and humans are susceptible to reinfection.",

Electron microscopy of ORFV reveals a virion with a long axis of approximately 260 nm and a short axis of 160 nm [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] . Negatively stained preparations of parapoxviruses appear in two forms. In the capsular form where the stain has penetrated the virion, a finely crenelate membrane appears to surround an inner amorphous core, whereas virions that are impervious to the stain reveal a regular array of tubule-like structures arranged in a criss-cross manner along the length of the particle [73, 76] . Where the virus has been propagated in cell culture, virions that appear in the medium are surrounded by a membranous structure 9-18 nm thick. It has been suggested that this membrane, by analogy to VACV, has been derived from the Golgi. The criss-cross pattern seen by electron microscopy is apparently due to superimposed images of the tubule-like structure as it winds its way in a spiral around the viral particle much like a ball of wool. More recently, the surface ultrastructure of ORFV has been described using ultra high resolution scanning electron microscopy where spirally arranged protrusions are visible on the surface of the virion [77] .",

Preliminary characterisation of ORFV virion polypeptides [78] showed that up to 35 polypeptides could be resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of ORFV virion polypeptides solubilized by treatment with NP-40 and 2-mercaptoethanol showed that 13 of 35 polypeptide bands distinguishable in whole virion preparations, were found in supernatant fractions after detergent treatment. There appeared to be considerable enrichment for a polypeptide of 38.5 kDa. There were varying degrees of enrichment for the other 12 polypeptides. The major band in virus preparations was 64.5 kDa and was thought to be a major core polypeptide. Others have detected about 30-40 structural proteins of ORFV [79] [80] [81] . Studies on PCPV have shown that up to 40 polypeptides can be resolved by SDS-PAGE [82] .",

VACV has two infectious forms; IMV that are particles that have an outer membrane derived from the intermediate compartment, and extracellular enveloped virus (EEV), which are IMV particles that have an outer membrane derived from the trans-Golgi net-work (reviewed in [91] ). Viral encoded proteins that have been incorporated into these membranes of VACV have been identified. ORFV and BPSV have homologues of the IMV-associated proteins as well as homologues of several of the EEV-associated proteins (see below).

            "text": "Although the current evidence strongly suggests that cell-mediated immunity is likely to play a major role in conferring protective immunity against ORFV infection, the role of antibody in protection is less clear. Understanding the mechanisms of protective immunity to ORFV is complicated by the fact that immunity is short lived, whether it is induced by natural or experimental infection. Although there is general agreement that ORFV is able to reinfect its host, albeit the lesions are smaller and resolve sooner, there has been much debate over the role of humoral immunity in preventing or reducing the severity of lesions during reinfection. There are a number of reports that suggest that antibody is not important in protection or recovery. Early studies reported by Aynaud in 1923 showed that serum from immune animals was not protective [11] and many years later it was shown that colostrum passed onto lambs from their immune dams did not confer protection [93] [94] [95] . Others have shown that there was no relationship between antibody titre and severity of lesions. In experiments carried out by McKeever et al. [80] , it was observed that lambs that were seropositive were not protected from infection. Some investigators dispute the lack of importance of antibody. Lloyd [41] showed a strong correlation between IgG2 and the resolution of lesions subsequent to challenge, suggesting that a specific isotype was important in defence against ORFV infection. Lloyd suggested that the involvement of IgG2 in the immune response might explain observations by Buddle and Pulford [93] that colostral antibody failed to protect lambs from ORFV infection since IgG1 but not IgG2 is selectively transported in milk of ruminants.",

These studies showed that neutrophils accumulated in a biphasic manner with an initial influx at 24 h, followed by a second phase at 4 days post-infection, which coincided with the appearance of viral antigen in the epidermis [55, 96] . An influx of basophils also coincided with the appearance of antigen. A dense mass of MHC class II + dendritic cells (DC) developed in the necrotising dermis adjacent to infected hair follicles and under infected degenerating epidermis [56] . The MHC class II + cells accumulating in the dermis were shown to be CD1cells (acetylcholine esterase negative) that could be further subdivided based on Factor XIII expression [98] . These cells appear to form a barrier to invasion and may be involved in the immune response or wound repair [56, 98] . There was no evidence of epidermal Langerhans cell (CD1 + , acetylcholine esterase positive) involvement in the response [56] . In addition, different classes of T cells also accumulated including CD4 + , CD8 + and T19/WC + cells [97] . Anderson et al. [99] showed that CD4 + cells and DC accumulated to greater numbers than other cell types over the first 8 days. CD4 + cells concentrated in the papillary dermis. CD8 + cells were seen throughout the dermis and occasionally in the epidermis proximal to virus-infected epithelium. Studies of CD8 + T cells in ORFV lesions have suggested that, although these cells are recruited to the site of virus infection, they become trapped underneath the ORFV lesion and are unable to gain access to virus-infected cells [100] . In spite of the presence of activated cytolytic CD8 + T cells, the virus was able to replicate for several days. B cells were generally restricted to the reticular dermis underlying the virusinfected epithelium. T19 + cells were distributed throughout the dermis and occasionally in the epidermis.",

            "text": "The dynamics of the local immune response to ORFV infection has been studied by examining the cells and soluble mediators in afferent and efferent lymph draining from the site of infection. These studies have involved cannulating the afferent and efferent lymph ducts of prefemoral or popliteal lymph nodes draining an infection site in the hind flank of sheep [92, [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] . Acquired immunity to pathogens that infect skin is initiated in the peripheral lymph nodes. Antigen is carried to lymph nodes by antigen-presenting cells (APC) via the afferent lymphatic ducts. Antibody and cytotoxic T cells produced by the lymph nodes leave via the efferent lymph ducts and migrate to the infected site. In addition lymphocytes migrating from blood to the site of infection, cycle through the lymph node by passive movement and become activated during this process. Studies in sheep have shown that the local immune response to ORFV in reinfected animals was a biphasic lymph cell response involving CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells and DC (reviewed in [92] ). The studies showed that CD4 + T cells were the most numerous lymphocyte subset in afferent lymph and peaked on days 4 and 12 post infection in reinfected sheep [104] . A similar pattern was also seen in the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-8, IL-2 and interferon-(IFN-) in lymph cells cultured from afferent lymph collected at various times post infection. The study also showed that reinfected animals produce a strong memory response when given inactivated ORFV, which is essentially a delayed-type hypersensitivity response as shown by Buddle and Pulford [93] . Cytokine analysis of ORFV-infected tissue has also shown that the immune response to ORFV is predominantly a Th1 response [99] . Cells expressing tumour necrosis factor-(TNF-) included epidermal cells, vascular endothelium and uncharacterised cells that had lymphocyte morphology. The numbers of these cells increased more rapidly in skin after reinfection. Cells expressing IFN-mRNA were only detected after reinfection and these cells had lymphocyte morphology.",

Cyclosporin-A caused severe ORFV lesions to develop and was associated with the inhibition of IFNand IL-2. The lymphocyte depletion studies revealed that CD4 + T cells and antibody to a lesser extent are important for clearance of ORFV. The depletion of CD4 + cells was associated with virus persistence and correlated with previous studies showing that CD4 + T cells were the predominant T cells in skin and draining lymph node [108] . Although there was no correlation between CD8 + T cell depletion and size and resolution of ORFV lesions in this study, the role of CD8 + T cells cannot be excluded, since not all CD8 + T cells were depleted. The study suggested that the function of CD4 + T cells as helper cells for antibody could be important because of the correlation seen between antibody titres and lesion size.",

Furthermore, a memory response is indicated by a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to ORFV antigen in previously exposed animals. The discovery of immune modulators encoded by ORFV (see below) [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] may explain how ORFV is able to avoid, at least temporarily, the effects of host immunity. The accumulating evidence suggests that the immune evasion strategies of the parapoxviruses are similar across the genus ( [115] and unpublished data).",

Restriction endonuclease cleavage analyses of their genomes showed marked variability, although DNA/DNA hybridisation revealed strong inter-species homology between regions within the central core of the genomes, suggesting that, although there were sequence differences, their genomes were genetically conserved. There was a lack of cross-hybridisation between the terminal fragments of the parapoxviral genomes, suggesting significant differences in these areas [118, 119] .

Detailed restriction endonuclease cleavage maps were produced for 16 New Zealand isolates and the complete genome of ORFV strain NZ2 was cloned [125] [126] [127] . Sequencing of selected regions across the ORFV NZ2 genome revealed homologues of VACV genes. These included a dUTPase [128] , homologues of VACV H4L (RNA polymerase-associated protein RAP94), H5R (35-kDa virion envelope antigen) [123] H6R (topoisomerase) [129] and the 14K fusion protein [130] . The distribution of these genes suggested that ORFV and VACV were colinear [123] . Further \"spot sequencing\" over the entire genome identified further homologues of VACV and supported the notion that many genes in ORFV conserved the order, orientation and spacing of genes seen in VACV [124] . Sequencing of the terminal regions identified genes that did not have counterparts in VACV and were likely to be involved in pathogenesis and virulence. These included a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [112] , a homologue of IL-10 [110] , a chemokine binding protein (CBP) [131] and a GM-CSF/IL-2 inhibitory factor (GIF) [109] at the right end of the genome. Moreover, there were a number of open reading frames that did not show matches with protein sequences in public databases, some of which had ankyrin repeats [132] and some of which appeared to be homologues of VACV genes with no known function. In addition, early and late promoter sequences were identified by transcriptional mapping [123, [133] [134] [135] [136] . The early transcriptional termination motif, TTTTTNT, discovered in VACV, is conserved in ORFV [133, 137] . Furthermore, it was shown with VACV recombinants in which multi-gene ORFV fragments were inserted, that early ORFV genes were faithfully transcribed, demonstrating the conservation of transcriptional regulation between ORFV and orthopoxviruses [134, 135] . In addition, the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) of the ORFV NZ2 genome was described [112] .",

For example the ORFV genome includes 31 genes that lack clear matches in VACV, and 17 that have no significant homology with genes from all other poxvirus genera. Many of these are located in a 25-kbp region at the right terminus and are likely to encode factors that are involved in pathogenesis and virulence. Sequence analysis of approximately 25 kbp of the PCPV and PVNZ genomes has revealed the presence of this extended genus-specific region in these two other species (unpublished). Comparisons of predicted protein sequences of the three fully sequenced ORFV isolates revealed a degree of inter-isolate sequence variation that is uncommon among chordopoxviruses. For instance, amongst the 20 most variant genes, the average predicted amino acid sequence identity was only 80% [138] . Most of these genes are not seen in other poxviruses and have unknown functions. However, two of the most variant proteins are orthologs of envelope glycoproteins present in all mammalian poxviruses (VACV A33R and A34R). A33R has been shown to be a target of neutralizing antibody, leading to the suggestion that inter-isolate variation might represent \"escape mutants\" and be linked to the ability of ORFV to reinfect previously infected animals [138] . It has also been proposed that some of the inter-isolate variation seen in these ORFV proteins might be associated with hostspecific requirements for infection of different species, such as sheep and goat [115] . A homologue of the transcription factor VLTF-4 that shows little variability in capripoxviruses, Sheeppox virus and Goatpox virus is highly variable in ORFV and BPSV, suggesting that it may play a role in host range [115] . Both ORFV and BPSV encode proteins that are apparent homologues of orthopoxvirus proteins involved in the formation of A-type inclusions.",

Parapoxviruses also lack a Ser/ Thr protein kinase and the serine protease inhibitor and the kelch-like gene families found in all other chordopoxviruses except MOCV [115] . These genes are known to affect host responses including inflammation, apoptosis, complement activation and coagulation and are associated with virulence. The absence of these genes may, at least in the case of parapoxviruses, be compensated for by an alternative set of genus-specific genes involved in host manipulation.

In contrast, representatives of other poxvirus genera, including the high G+C of MOCV, display more uniform G+C contents across their genomes. In some cases the parapoxviral regions of uniform deviation in G+C content coincide with regions that show significant interisolate sequence variation.

            "text": "Studies on viral IL-10-like molecules have provided insights into structure -function aspects of cellular IL-10. The active form of mammalian IL-10 is a homodimer. The three-dimensional structure of human IL-10 [157] [158] [159] and its interaction with its receptor at the molecular level has been determined [160] . It has been shown that a total of 27 amino acids of IL-10 contact the binding interface of the IL-10 receptor. These amino acids are located within both the near N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of IL-10. Examination of ORFV-IL-10 reveals that it conserves 11 of the 16 Nterminal amino acids of human IL-10 that make contact with the receptor and 10 of the 11 C-terminal residues. Although ORFV-IL-10 and EBV-IL-10 resemble their host counterparts only ORFV-IL-10 has all the functional activities of mammalian IL-10, whereas EBV-IL-10 has only a subset of activities, having evolved a more immunosuppressive form [161] [162] [163] [164] . It was originally thought that EBV IL-10 lacked immunostimulatory activities because of differences at the N terminus, which had been suggested to contain the immunostimulatory domain; however, studies on ORFV-IL-10 showed that it was also different within this region, although it costimulated thymocytes and mast cells [122, 155] . The concept that IL-10 has multiple domains is no longer accepted and it is believed that essentially two regions bind to the receptor, one region at the near N terminus and the other at the C terminus [165] . It is intriguing that ORFV has not evolved a more immunosuppressive form of this virokine, like EBV IL-10. This may suggest that mutations of the ORFV-IL-10 to a potentially more immunosuppressive form may compromise the coexistence of host and virus.",

Chemokines are a large family of molecules that recruit and activate immune cells at sites of inflammation and infection [168, 169] . Thus far, a CBP has been found in ORFV, BPSV, PVNZ (unpublished). The most well characterised of these is the CBP of ORFV NZ2 , which is a protein of 286 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31.2 kDa [111] . ORFV NZ2 -CBP shows surprisingly low similarity to CBPs of orthopoxviruses or leporipoxviruses with only approximately 16% amino acid identity. The parapoxvirus CBPs are more similar to ORFV-GIF at the polypeptide level than to other poxvirus proteins (approximately 20% identical at the amino acid level). This suggests that the Parapoxvirus, Orthopoxvirus and Leporipoxvirus genera share a common ancestral gene that became modified during the course of evolution to create different binding specificities [111] . The orthopoxvirus and leporipoxvirus CBPs share a high level of identity and many of the highly conserved regions of sequence within these CBPs are not apparent in the parapoxvirus CBPs. In addition, only six of the eight cysteine residues present in other poxvirus CBPs are found in parapoxvirus CBPs. The viral CBPs, including those found in the herpesvirus group, bear no sequence or structural homology to any known G-protein coupled receptors or mammalian proteins.",

Furthermore, the binding spectrum of ORFV-CBP suggests that in addition to inhibiting chemokineinduced chemotaxis, it has evolved to target Th1 antiviral responses.

Epidermal hyperplasia is a feature of the response to ORFV infection and this feature was also reduced in infections with the VEGF deletion mutant.

A predicted dsRNA binding motif is present in ORFV 020 and it has been shown to bind specifically to dsRNA and to competitively inhibit the activation (phosphorylation) of the ovine dsRNA-dependent PKR gene. In addition, cell lysates from ORFVinfected cells diminished PKR phosphorylation, which was also observed in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, indicating that the inhibitory activity is encoded by an early gene [114] .

This motif is named after the cytoskeleton protein, ankyrin, which contains 24 copies of the motif. The motif is recognised as a mediator of protein-protein interactions. ORFV encodes five such proteins and BPSV seven. Each of the ORFV genes can be paired with a corresponding gene in BPSV, but the direct relationships between the parapoxvirus proteins and other chordopoxvirus ankyrin repeat genes are less clear. In fact, any one of the parapoxvirus ankyrin repeat proteins shows more similarity to all of the other parapoxvirus ankyrin repeat proteins than to any of the ankyrin repeat proteins in other poxviruses. However, all five ORFV and seven BPSV ankyrin repeat proteins carry the C-terminal F-box-like domain present in most poxviral ankyrin repeat proteins and this has led to the suggestion that these proteins may function within the ubiquitin-proteasome system by acting as recognition subunits of cellular ubiquitin ligase complexes [139] .

The skin is the largest organ of the body and has evolved a highly specialised defence system to respond rapidly to invading organisms. Keratinocytes are the principle immune cell within the epidermis and act as proinflammatory signal transducers responding to non-specific stimuli by secreting inflammatory cytokines, chemotactic factors and adhesion molecules into the extracellular fluid of the epidermal compartment [188] . In the initial phase of non-specific cutaneous inflammation, keratinocytes release IL-1 and TNF-. IL-1 and TNF-activate dermal vascular endothelium, which up-regulates the expression of adhesion molecules involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to the endothelium. In conjunction with chemokines, these cytokines direct the migration of leukocytes from the circulatory system into the epidermis. TNF-is down-regulated in activated keratinocytes by cellular IL-10 [189] , suggesting that the production of proinflammatory cytokines produced by these cells may be the main targets of viral IL-10 during the early stages of cutaneous inflammation. There is no evidence that parapoxviruses produce receptor-like homologues of IL-1 or TNF-to sequester these cytokines. Furthermore, there is no evidence at this time to suggest that parapoxviruses produce factors other than IL-10 that disrupt the induction of the proinflammatory signalling cascade in virus infected cells. Poxviruses in general have developed multiple strategies to minimize the deleterious effects of proinflammatory cytokines but few encode a viral IL-10. It is likely that parapoxvirus factors will be discovered in the future that specifically target pathways that lead to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in virusinfected cells. In addition, the production of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by immigrating macrophages and CD8 + cells are likely to be blocked by viral IL-10.",

In addition, the ability of ORFV-CBP to bind lymphotactin suggests that lymphocytes, B cells, DC and NK cells are of particular significance in the immune response to parapoxviruses. Although lymphotactin is also a chemotactic factor for neutrophils, the heavy infiltration of polymorphs into ORFV lesions suggests that these cells are being recruited to the site of infection predominantly by the CXC chemokines to which CBP does not bind. It has recently been reported that CD8 + cytotoxic T cell infiltration into tumours is enhanced by transgene expression of lymphotactin by CD8 + T cells [201] . In light of this observation, it is interesting to note that activated CD8 + cells appear to become trapped under ORFV lesions [100] , suggesting that the specificity of CBP for lymphotactin may provide an explanation for this observation.",

In addition, GM-CSF is involved in the maturation of DC. IL-2 stimulates T cell and NK cell activation and proliferation. It also stimulates the proliferation of activated B cells and may play a role in the survival of cytotoxic T cells at the site of the infection. It is tempting to speculate that CD8 + cytotoxic T cells are a major target of ORFV immunomodulators and that their proliferation, migration, activation and survival are affected by these factors.

            "text": "A further point of intervention by parapoxviruses could involve APC, which could be of particular significance during reinfection and persistent infections. It is apparent that the host produces a memory response to ORFV [93, 104] , inferring that ORFV has the capability to replicate, albeit temporarily, in the immune host. The question is how ORFV is able to subvert the reactivation of memory T cells during reinfection. The evidence suggests that dermal DC or blood-derived DC are involved in initiating the immune response to ORFV, since Langerhans cells do not appear to play a role [56] . In the normal course of events DC are recruited to the site of infection, capture antigen, mature and migrate to the lymph node in response to constitutive chemokines where they present antigen to na\u00efve T cells or memory T cells. APC other than DC may be involved during reinfection. Parapoxviruses have the potential to disrupt this process at multiple points. It is possible that the viral secreted immunomodulators GIF, IL-10, CBP, and VEGF work in concert to inhibit this process. DC have been observed to accumulate at the site of infection in ORFV-infected animals [56] and it has been observed that there is a reduction in DC trafficking from the epidermis to the lymph node at a point when ORFV replication is maximal, suggesting intervention by viral immunomodulators [92] . Although GIF and viral IL-10 have the potential to disrupt antigen presentation and activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the lymph node, we have no evidence that the viral cytokines are carried into the lymph node by passive movement. If this is the case, viral IL-10 could potentially block the development of the acquired immune response and may have effects on the development of immune memory, such as the induction of tolerogenic T cells. The IL-2 binding properties of GIF could block clonal expansion of CD8 + cells and the sequestering of lymphotactin could all impact on the development of a Th1 response [131] . It has also been reported that ORFV induces apoptosis in APC via the CD95 pathway in a mouse model [203] and CMV-IL-10 has been shown to increase apoptosis associated with DC maturation [204] . This may be a further mechanism that the parapoxviruses exploit to reduce or delay the development of the acquired immune response. It is also possible that parapoxviral IL-10 could skew the immune response towards a Th2 response during the early phase of infection, as proposed for CMV via viral IL-10 [204] and that may also involve the induction of immunological tolerance. Such a response might explain persistent parapoxvirus infections.",

Recent studies with inactivated ORFV D1701 have shown that it induces a complex autoregulatory cytokine response that involves the up-regulation of IL-12, IL-18, IFN-and other Th1 cytokines and their subsequent down-regulation that is accompanied by the induction of IL-4 [210] .

In a further study, intramuscular injection of recombinant ORFV D1701 expressing the nucleoprotein p40 of Borna disease virus was shown to protect rats against Borna disease virus infection of the brain [211] .
