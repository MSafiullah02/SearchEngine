The dengue fever has, thus become one of the most widespread disease (Sukhralia et al., 2018). The virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus (Westaway et al., 1985; Back and Lundkvist, 2013). DENV is an arbovirus, having two known mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti (Gratz, 1999) and Aedes albopictus (Lambrechts et al., 2010). The positive stranded RNA genome of dengue virus is of 10.7 Kb size and composed of three structural proteins (Envelope, Capsid, Membrane) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B,NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) (Imrie et al., 2010; Guzman et al., 2010; Sukhralia et al., 2018). There are atleast four serotypes and they show 65% similarity in the genome structure (Azhar et al., 2015; Ramanathan et al., 2016).",

During primary infection, the body develops immune responses in the form of antibodies against the particular serotype attacked (Schmid et al., 2016). But the main complexity of DENV arises during the secondary infection with another serotype, leading to serious version of dengue infection like Dengue Haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) (Dar and Ghosh, 2015; Matheus et al., 2005; Schmid et al., 2016). This is caused due to the antibodies produced during primary attack which complicate the secondary DENV infection by a phenomenon known as Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) (Durbin and Whitehead, 2011; Flipse et al., 2016). During ADE, there is a cross reaction between the antibodies of the primary infection and virus of secondary infection such that there is an increased infection in macrophages and monocytes (Whitehorn and Simmons, 2011; Durbin et al., 2010). These challenges bring the importance of an archetypal dengue vaccine which can provide life time immunity against all the serotypes (Thomas, 2011; Russell and Halstead, 2016).",

            "text": "Currently, the vaccine candidates that are under various stages of clinical trial are the live attenuated viruses (Thomas et al., 2012), chimeric vaccine (Guy et al., 2015), recombinant vaccine with adjuvants (Hertz et al., 2017), reverse vaccinology (Baliga et al., 2018), purified and inactivated virions (Fernandez et al., 2015), subunit proteins and plasmid DNA (Thisyakorn and Thisyakorn, 2014). Among these, live attenuated DENGVAXIA or CYD-TDV, a tetravalent chimeric dengue vaccine (Scott, 2016), developed by Sanofi Pasteur in December 2015, is the first licensed vaccine in some Asian and Latin American countries (Pitisuttithum and Bouckenooghe, 2016; Flaschw et al., 2016). These clinical manifestations caused by the vaccine are ascribed to inefficiency of the vaccine in producing competent T- cells that protect against DENV disease (Kim et al., 2010). Moreover, the vaccine does not encode any non- structural proteins which are required by the virus to evade immune response of the host (Halstead, 2017; Morrison et al., 2012). All these studies imply that a vaccine that is tetravalent and simultaneously prevents antibody- dependent enhancement (ADE) needs to be designed urgently. These concerns led to the need for a relatively new technique of vaccine development i.e. Epitope or synthetic peptide based vaccines. As DENV has both structural and non-structural proteins for its viral activity (Oliveira et al., 2014), conserved epitopes may prove to be useful in designing synthetic peptide based vaccine. This can be easily initiated in today's time, as there is no dearth of information about genome sequences in the databases (Hasan et al., 2013; Sharmin and Islam, 2014).",

There are four serotypes of DENV which show 65% similarity at genomic level and share same epidemics. Yet the difference in their interactions with antibodies is enough to make the development of a common vaccine, a mammoth task (Lalla et al., 2014). The urgent need of dengue vaccine development is presented by the alarming rise in the dengue endemics (Deen, 2016; Wichmann et al., 2017). Although various vaccines are undergoing clinical trials worldwide but presently, there is no specific dengue therapeutics or vaccine available which provides overall protection against this viral infection. Recently, the only licensed DENV vaccine Dengvaxia, has been reported as a failure as it lacks DENV non-structural protein antigens, and is found to be incompetent to raise antibodies against NS1 (Halstead, 2017).",

            "text": "To achieve our objective, conserved epitopes have been obtained from both structural and non-structural proteins. We could successfully found six highly conserved epitopes, one from structural protein and other five from non-structural proteins. Among structural proteins, only Envelope protein showed 100% conserved epitope (RCPTQGE), indicating this as a good target for vaccine designing. Other structural proteins like PrM and Capsid did not show any conservancy among the predicted epitopes. This was expected as the structural proteins are known to be highly variable even within serotypes (Modis et al., 2005). The predicted epitopes of Envelope protein (RCPTQGE); NS3 (SAAQRRGR, PGTSGSPI); NS4A (QRTPQDNQL); NS4B (LQAKATREAQKRA) and NS5 proteins (QRGSGQV) were found out to be antigenic, hydrophillic, surface accessible, flexible and consists of beta turn. Thus, these epitopes fulfill all the pre-requisite conditions of a desired epitope. Moreover, the functions of these proteins can be used as an asset for controlling the effect of the virus on the host. For instance, NS1 is an important cofactor for the formation of replication complex, and has also been exploited for the development of vaccine (Mackenzie et al., 1996; Hertz et al., 2017) whereas NS4B regulates the helicase activity of NS3 and NS4A-NS4B complex is required for genome replication (Miller et al., 2006; Umareddy et al., 2006). NS5 is the most conserved protein of DENV and its C-terminal containing RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) domain is crucial for genomic replication (Hannemann et al., 2013: Ashour et al., 2009). Therefore, we can say that each of these proteins are essential for replication of the virus inside the host and therefore, they can be used as common vaccine target for all the four serotypes of Dengue virus. Serotype specific conserved epitopes can also be exploited for detection of Dengue at early stages. During the Phase IIb and III trials, DENGVAXIA's specific response against DENV2 serotype largely became negligible. So, a vaccine developed using these epitopes could overcome this problem as these predicted epitopes are found to be conserved in all four serotypes of DENV.",
