Mutations can have, on the one hand, an environmental advantage and, on the other hand, a fitness cost (Soderholm et al., 2006). A typical example of this dual effect is escape mutations from CD8+ T cells (CTLs) in viruses. While these mutations can lead to a higher survival probability, they often lead to a lower probability of producing functional virions. We here use bioinformatics tools to analyze the relation between the frequency of escape mutations and the organisms\u2019 complexity.",

            "text": "CTLs recognize virally infected cells through small (typically 8\u201310 amino acid long) peptides, denoted epitopes. These epitopes are presented in the binding groove of MHC class I molecules located on the surface of these cells (Williams et al., 2002). When an appropriate CTL encounters a host cell expressing such epitopes, the host cell is rapidly destroyed along with its hosted virus (Aebischer et al., 1991, Bowen and Walker, 2005 Jun 6, McMichael and Phillips, 1997). This leads to an evolutionary pressure on viruses to avoid this detection in order to survive and infect new cells. Peptide binding to MHC-I groove requires well-defined binding motifs. Only a few percent of the possible peptides have such a motif, limiting the number of possible epitopes in every protein to approximately 1\u20132% of all possible nine-mers for a given HLA allele (Yewdell, 2006). The HLA polymorphism challenges viruses with a changing environment that may result in back-and-forth (toggling) escape mutations (Delport et al., 2008) and thus limit the fixation of mutation. However, mutations in the cleavage sites of the highly conserved proteasome or in positions that binds to conserved HLA motifs can lead to a removal of epitopes at the population level. Thus, in principle, a very limited number of properly positioned mutations can completely hide a viral protein from CTLs.",

These mutations have the obvious advantage of reducing the probability that a CTL would kill the virus. The balance between the fitness cost and the advantage obtained by escape mutation leads to a non-uniform epitope density distribution among different viral proteins. We have recently shown, for example, that proteins expressed early in the viral life cycle have a lower epitope density than proteins expressed late in the viral life cycle (Agranovich et al., 2011, Vider-Shalit et al., 2009a, Vider-Shalit et al., 2007), and that proteins with a low copy number have more epitopes than proteins with a high copy number (Maman et al., 2011a). Here, we study the relation between the accumulation of escape mutations and the viral complexity (as shall be further defined). Specifically, we test whether the (dis)advantage of a given mutation is determined by the mutation itself or whether it is related to the complexity of the entire protein or perhaps even the entire organism.",

            "text": "The relation between complexity and selection was initially studied by the pioneering work of Fisher in 1930 (Fisher, 1930). Fisher proposed that as the dimensionality of the phenotype increases, the probability of a mutation being beneficial decreases due to its pleiotropic effects and different dimensions of the phenotype. The phenotype dimensionality is defined by the number of organism\u2019s parts (phenotypic characters \u2013denoted hereafter as n). Kimura and Orr then expanded Fisher\u2019s work and showed that Fisher underestimated the cost of complexity by not incorporating the lower fixation probability of mutations with a limited phenotypic effect following the effect of stochastic drift (Kimura, 1983, Orr, 2000). Orr (2000) further showed that the average fitness increase rate is inversely proportional to n for small and medium n and much faster for large n. In other words, the adaptation rate of complex organisms is lower than the one of simpler ones. Welch and Waxman (2003) examined the robustness of Orr\u2019s model by introducing different mechanisms (such as varying magnitude of mutations, modularity (Wagner, 1996, Wagner and Altenberg, 1996, Baatz and Wagner, 1997) and a constant mean mutational chance per phenotypic character). They showed that the relation between the complexity and adaptation rate is robust to most variations of the model. Gillespie, 1994, Gillespie, 1984, Gillespie, 1983 extended Fisher\u2019s model and proposed the mutational landscape model. Orr, 2003, Orr, 2002 further extended his work and found different patterns that characterize the adaptation of DNA sequences. His model was tested using single stranded DNA viruses (Rokyta et al., 2005). These studies were done in the regime of weak selection and low mutation rate.",

Most viruses budding from a given cell are destroyed and most infected cells can be cleared extremely fast in the presence of an immune response, since CTLs can induce apoptosis in infected cells within minutes (Regoes et al., 2007, Macken and Perelson, 1984) (for reviews see Yates et al., 2007, Regoes et al., 2007). The mutation rate of viruses can reach 1.e\u22124 mutations per base pair per replication (Sanjuan et al., 2010). We here show, using bioinformatics measurements, a direct relation between organisms\u2019 complexity (as defined by their proteins\u2019 length and their number) and their epitope density. The ratio between the epitope density and the expected epitope density based on the amino acid composition of each protein are used to estimate the accumulation of escape mutations. Viruses with a low number of proteins accumulate more escape mutations per protein than large ones, and short proteins accumulate more escape mutations than long ones, even in steady state.",

Removing a limited part of the epitopes has a very limited advantage and can have a high fitness cost. Thus, even if the cost per mutation is larger in small viruses (and the more so if it is constant), the increase in the number of total required mutations makes it harder for large viruses to adapt. Thus, the very clear negative correlation between the number of proteins and the accumulation of escape mutations may be a result of the \u201call or none\u201d selection force affecting viruses.",

Note that some large viruses show a limited extent of selection. Furthermore, some small viruses have an SIR score higher than 1, as is expected from the low number of proteins in such viruses and the random variability in the epitope density.
