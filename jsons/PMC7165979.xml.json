In addition, transmission of disease is also dependent on virulence of the pathogen and whether other infectious disease processes are already ongoing in the exposed individual. The evolution of successful pathogens seems remarkable in the face of what we know about mammalian immune systems after decades of intense investigation. However, pathogens in general and viral pathogens in particular rapidly mutate and evolve to counteract the non\u2010specific, innate responses of mammals and the highly specific adaptive immune response.",

Because viruses rely on the host for growth, survival, and transmission, they have evolved diverse methods to escape elimination by the host's immune system. Generally, this is referred to as immune evasion, and the simple reason for a virus to evade the host's protective mechanisms is to acquire time for replication and transmission of progeny to other cells or hosts or to hide from surveillance by the immune system in a latent state. A large body of literature now exists on the main mechanisms engaged by viruses to evade the immune system. Immune evasion can be achieved by the interruption of various host responses including the innate response, cellular responses, humoral responses, and inhibition of immune effector molecules (1). The result of immune evasion is clinical disease or infection that is protracted over time.",

Eliminating the possibility of recognizing viral epitopes presented in context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules is common during infection by successful viral pathogens (2, 3, 4, 5). To evade humoral immunity, viruses may undergo antigenic variation or encode proteins that induce polyclonal activation of B cells, leading to hyper\u2010production of immunoglobulins (Igs) not necessarily protective against the virus (6, 7). Other viruses encode highly glycosylated envelope proteins such that the glycosylation can mask the neutralizing epitopes, thus rendering the antibody response ineffective (8, 9). In some infections, viral proteins have been shown to inhibit complement\u2010mediated killing of infected cells (10) or target effector molecules by encoding either homologous cytokines or cytokine receptors, having acquired such genes through modification or capturing of host cellular genes (11, 12, 13).",

However, other mouse \u2018models\u2019 have been reported extensively where disease pathology does not have any relationship to the pathology in the host of interest. A clear example in livestock is vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which does not cause vesicles at all in mice but rather causes encephalitis. Contrarily, this virus gains its name from the natural disease pathology in cattle, horses, and swine, which is characterized by vesicular lesions on the lips, tongue, snout, and coronary bands of the feet (15). Similarly, rodents are a poor model for foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection, as infection of mice requires high doses of virus and there is no clinical vesicular disease. Further, important gene loci such as Ig and T\u2010cell receptor diverged after separation of rodent and livestock species during evolution (16), thereby compromising translation of results in mice to the natural hosts. Here, we focus our discussion to one of the natural hosts of FMDV infection, swine.",

The role of important innate cell populations has been a focus of recent research efforts, and many aspects of the response of these cell types have been studied. A comprehensive understanding of the innate response to viral infection still requires a great deal more investigation, as knowledge of the relationship of this virus and the infected cell is extensive but not yet comprehensive. By contrast, information on the immunopathology of FMDV in infected animals is sparse, though recently there has been more activity on this subject. Here, we endeavor to inform about current knowledge as well as identify areas lacking in information and understanding. Understanding FMDV immunopathology in vivo remains a very high priority, given an outbreak of FMDV in North America is anticipated to cause losses in the billions of dollars to the economies of Mexico, Canada, and the United States.",

In swine, viral infections that can be studied to more fully understand immune evasion in a natural host include pseudorabies virus (PrV). This virus belongs to the alphaherpesviridae subfamily of Herpersvirinae, the same subfamily as the human herpes simplex virus (HSV) and bovine herpes viruses (BoHV), and has many features in common with these viruses. It infects the central nervous system (CNS) and establishes latency. PrV induces apoptosis in the host inflammatory cells, while it inhibits apoptosis of the trigeminal ganglion neurons where it resides during the latency period (17). While the genes involved in similar anti\u2010apoptotic mechanisms in HSV\u20101 or \u20102 infection are known, in PrV the most likely candidates are the Us3 and LAT genes, which share RNA homology with anti\u2010apoptotic molecules in muscle cells (18).",

Infected cells display viral glycoproteins on the plasma membrane, but in the presence of virus\u2010specific antibodies, redistribution of viral glycoproteins on the cell surface occurs, which leads to their aggregation, capping, and finally shedding. Further, when infected monocytes are incubated with glycoprotein\u2010specific antibodies, viral glycoproteins are endocytosed. In both cases, the result is no display of viral proteins on the cell surface membrane of infected cells, rendering such cells invisible to CTLs. This is particularly important for glycoproteins B and D (19, 20). Likely, PrV subverts the antibody response phase of infection until it establishes latency.

It causes an ailment termed post\u2010weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in piglets aged 5\u201312 weeks and has tropism for cells of the monocytic lineage. PCV2 escapes into dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages and shows no evidence of replication and neither does the virus kill the cells nor alter any of the activation markers on the cells harboring the virus. There is no cytokine profile modification (23). Once the virus is released from the cells, it is infectious to other cells. Given that DCs circulate to perform their function, it is possible that the virus is kept and spread in the host through DCs and macrophages without detection by the immune effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and CTLs. Moreover, PCV2 causes depletion of NK cells, \u03b3\u03b4T cells, and B cells (24).

The virus targets the DCs and downregulates expression of MHC class I and II and costimulatory molecules such as CD80/86 (27).

It does so by inhibiting the activation of IPS\u20101 within the RIG\u2010I signaling pathway leading to diminished production of IFN\u03b2. The lack of this type 1 IFN leads to reduced DC\u2013NK cell cross\u2010talk. Together with the upregulation of IL\u201010 impairing function of T lymphocytes, the virus is allowed to persist.",

The generalized polyclonal B\u2010cell activation may produce autoantibodies to double\u2010stranded (ds) DNA, Golgi glycoproteins, and other autoantigens, presumably leading to subversion of normal B\u2010cell repertoire development.

A positive strand RNA virus, FMDV rapidly mutates in the course of an outbreak of infection, creating quasi species within the broader serotype (32).

Fever and viremia last only 1 or 2 days, and lesions normally resolve rapidly, in 7\u201310 days.

This arrests cap\u2010dependent mRNA and cellular protein synthesis, and because the virus has an internal ribosome entry sight, the protein synthesis complexes are bound by the viral RNA genome. Infected cells therefore have mostly viral protein synthesis and little cellular proteins translated (37, 38). This is likely to have a significant effect on inducing immune responses, as infected cells have been shown to lose class I MHC expression. With no new protein synthesis, these effects likely lead to no viral protein peptides getting loaded into newly synthesized MHC molecules via the endogenous pathway, and therefore, no induction of a CD8+ T\u2010cell response can occur. Data for CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in animals infected with FMDV is minimal, and no infected cell killing by CTLs has ever been reported.",

Like many viruses, FMDV is very sensitive to these cytokines (39, 40, 41). The bulk of knowledge in this area has been obtained by using a serotype A virus derived from an infectious clone (A12) that has the leader protease removed (LLA12). Deletion of Lpro in the LLA12 virus results in a highly attenuated virus that fails to replicate in otherwise susceptible primary cell lines (39). In addition, infection of animals with the LLA12 virus rarely causes viremia, and lesions are restricted to the inoculation sites, resulting in the rapid clearance of the virus before induction of neutralizing antibodies (42, 43). However both the wildtype virus and the LLA12 replicate to almost the same degree in BHK\u201021 cells or in suckling mice (44) due to defects in type 1 IFN response machinery in these systems (45, 46). Furthermore, supernatants from LLA12\u2010infected porcine or bovine fibroblasts had a stronger type 1 IFN\u2010mediated antiviral activity relative to those from wildtype infection (40). These data indicate that Lpro contributes to the virulence of FMDV and plays a significant role in suppressing the innate immune response to this virus, permitting replication and transmission between susceptible species.",

NF\u2010\u03baB is a ubiquitous protein that regulates genes (including IFN\u03b2) responsible for innate and adaptive immunity. Inactive NF\u2010\u03baB is found in the cytoplasm coupled to an inhibitory protein, I\u03baB. Viral infections and other stressors induce a signaling cascade via pathogen\u2010associated molecular pattern receptors leading to the activation of NF\u2010\u03baB (47). Activated NF\u2010\u03baB translocates to the nucleus, where it mediates gene transcription. Infection of BHK\u201021 cells with FMDV wildtype or LLA12 results in translocation of NF\u2010\u03baB into the nucleus (48). However, at later stages of the infection, there is degradation of the nuclear NF\u2010\u03baB in wildtype infected cells but not in the LLA12 infected cells. The degradation of NF\u2010\u03baB correlates with translocation of FMDV Lpro into the nucleus. Furthermore, NF\u2010\u03baB degradation is observed when Lpro is introduced into the cells in the absence of other FMDV proteins (48). Thus, degradation of NF\u2010\u03baB by FMDV Lpro might be another mechanism by which FMDV mediates the downregulation of inflammatory gene transcription and hence inhibition of innate immunity.",

Classical swine fever virus, for example, induces a severe lymphopenia of 7\u201310 days duration (51, 52, 53). PRRSV causes a transient leukopenia (54, 55) and pathology in lymphoid tissues of infected swine (56). Similarly, multiple strains of FMDV have been shown to cause lymphopenia in swine involving multiple subsets of peripheral lymphocytes (57, 58, Nfon et al., manuscript submitted). This lymphopenia is characterized by a decline in the absolute numbers as well as percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and closely correlates with peaks of viremia. The more virulent strains for pig (O1 Campos, O Taiwan 97, A24 Cruzeiro, C3 Resende, and Cs8C1) induce more profound lymphopenia compared with the less virulent strains (O\u2010SK2000 and A12), inducing mild and delayed lymphopenia. Active infection of lymphocytes is not responsible for the lymphopenia, as virus could not be recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of infected pigs despite high viremia. In addition, PBMCs were not infected in vitro (59, 60). However, a plaque purified, tissue culture strain of serotype C, Cs8C1, inoculated into young pigs has been reported to infect lymphocytes (58). There is no significant increase in apoptosis of peripheral and tissue lymphocytes, and the recovery from lymphopenia is usually rapid.",

IFN\u03b1 protects swine from FMDV infection when administered 24\u201348 h before challenge (61, 62). IFN\u03b1 may contribute to early clearance of viremia by preventing further propagation of virus in susceptible cells (42). Despite this activity, FMDV replicates rapidly and attains peak viremia within 48\u201372 h of infection. This observation suggests a potential for swine to mount an innate response to FMDV that is insufficient to stop the early establishment of infection but plays a significant role in viral clearance. For instance, IFN\u03b1 secretion may activate cells mediating an innate response and/or induce an antiviral state in susceptible tissue, although not in time to completely block infection. Either of these possibilities is consistent with published data analyzing exogenous delivery of IFN\u03b1 (61).",

DCs previously described in swine peripheral blood include myeloid/monocyte\u2010derived DCs (MoDCs) (65, 66, 67) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) (68). pDCs are specialized IFN\u03b1\u2010secreting cells and produce large amounts of this cytokine in response to many viral infections.

MoDCs secrete type 1 IFNs in response to FMDV; however, stimulation of MoDCs with synthetic dsRNA, polyI:C (60), induces a stronger IFN response than FMDV.",

Furthermore, immune serum is required for an abortive infection of monocytes in vitro (79). Similarly, we found no evidence of productive infection of LCs in vitro and from LCs isolated from infected swine despite the high susceptibility of surrounding keratinocytes (59, 60). Viral products and replication intermediates released by lysed, infected cells and taken up by DCs may account for this immunosuppression. However, viral RNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of RNA samples isolated from in vitro exposed LCs after 1 h adsorption, indicating that FMDV can bind to and be internalized by LCs (59). Indeed, by immunohistochemistry, Gregg et al. (80) detected low levels of FMDV antigen within LCs. Because FMDV is a positive sense RNA virus, viral protein synthesis can be initiated upon uptake and before virus inactivation. Thus, low levels of viral proteins, particularly the rapidly translated, self\u2010cleaving Lpro, may occur within DCs even in the absence of replication.",

Most studies on how NK cells are affected by infection have been performed on viruses that are persistent or chronic in nature, although acute infections may also lead to dysfunction of NK cells (reviewed in 83). In fact, during porcine infection with FMDV, this may be the case. Pig peripheral blood NK cells are rather quiescent in nature and only increase their cytotoxicity after stimulation with NK cell\u2010activating cytokines, such as IL\u201015 (84, Toka et al., manuscript submitted). Peripheral blood NK cells from FMDV serotype O\u2010infected pigs do not increase their cytotoxicity, as opposed to the responses of these cells in infections such as MCVM in the mouse (85, 86). Instead, the swine NK cell response declines beginning from the second or third day after FMDV infection. Such a state of dysfunction usually lasts for 2\u20133 days, after which reactivity returns to background levels. Higher viral titers in the serum of infected animals appear to coincide with the reduction in NK cell cytotoxicity. Curiously, when the effector protein expression such as perforin was compared in infected cells and non\u2010infected cells, there was only a marginal difference (Toka et al., manuscript submitted). This observation may indicate that while the granzyme/perforin killing mechanism may be intact, other pathways are possibly modulated by FMDV resulting in reduced antiviral activity of NK cells. However, intracellular expression of IFN\u03b3 was inhibited, which may largely contribute the inactive status of NK cells during FMDV infection. Inhibition of cytokines or chemokines is one of the strategies used by viruses to subvert the immune system. These processes take place in non\u2010infected cells, requiring that the mechanism of this inhibition likely involves products, cellular or viral, from infected cells.",
