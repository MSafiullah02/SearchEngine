Open data resources, along with data-driven methodologies, provide many opportunities to improve the response of the different administrations to the virus. We describe the present limitations and difficulties encountered in most of the open-data resources. To facilitate the access to the main open-data portals and resources, we identify the most relevant institutions, at a world scale, providing Covid-19 information and/or auxiliary variables (demographics, mobility, etc.).

Since the number of institutions and research teams working nowadays against the virus is growing at a very fast pace, it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of all the meaningful open-data providers. At a global world scope, it is easier to identify the relevant open-data resources. However, the enumeration of the regional institutions providing local information is so extensive that we address it specifically only for some countries (like China, Italy, Spain, and the U.S, among others). We focus on the variables that have an effect on the evolution and control of the disease at a global and regional scale. That is, we do not cover in this document the data specifically related to medical treatments, vaccines, etc. We do provide open resources for the number of hospitalized cases, intensive care units (ICU) cases, number of tests,etc. These variables are very relevant to monitor the evolution of the pandemic and also to evaluate the actions taken by the decision-makers.",

We first analyze in Section 2 the different variables that have a significant effect on the evolution and control of the epidemic (demographics, mobility, weather conditions, government measures, etc.). The opportunities that open data resources on Covid-19 offer to fight the pandemic are highlighted, from a data-driven perspective, in Section 3. Different limitations and inaccuracies of the currently available sources, along with the difficulties encountered when using them in a data-science context are discussed in Section 4. The most relevant open data institutions at a global scale, addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, are enumerated in Section 5. More functionally, in Section 6, we identify open source communities that facilitate access to the required data. In Section 7 we identify open-data sets related to specific Covid-19 variables at a global and regional scale. The open access to auxiliary variables of interest to model specific aspects of the pandemic, like seasonal behaviour or local mortality rate is described in Section 8. The open e-learning on Covid-19 is illustrated by means of some examples in Section 9. We finish the paper with a section of conclusions.",

The main objective is to calculate the basic reproductive number R 0 of the well-known Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. Several works have calculated R 0 for some outbreaks of specific locations. The estimated values are ranging from 2 to 3 [29] . However, only limited data have been used in the majority of works. Achieving an accurate model of the reproduction of the virus is a challenging task, which involves many variables.

The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia. Thus, the infected cases without a positive laboratory test are not considered confirmed cases, on a general basis, in the time-series data available in the different open-source repositories. The same problem can be encountered when analyzing death cases. In many situations, only the ones that were previously confirmed by a laboratory test are included in the data sets.",

Some exceptions are the massive tests done in small towns (for example in the north of Italy) in which the tests indicated that the fraction of asymptomatic cases in the population could be significant (comparable or even larger than the symptomatic cases). Therefore, asymptomatic cases play an important role in virus transmission [4] . Furthermore, important inaccuracies have been reported on the use of fast tests.

In [41] the authors show that in March 2020, the areas with significant community transmission of Covid-19 had distribution roughly along the 30-50 N corridor at consistently similar weather patterns consisting of average temperatures of 5-11C, combined with low specific (3-6 g/kg) and absolute humidity (4-7 g/m3). In [45] , the authors study the relationship between temperature, humidity and the transmission rate of Covid-19. They used data collected from all the cities in China with more than 100 cases. The authors use a lineal regression framework as a model. Results indicate that one-degree Celsius increase in temperature and one per cent increase in relative humidity lower R 0 by 0.0225 and 0.0158, respectively.

The difficulties in predicting the effects of the Covid-19 anti-measures on the regional evolution of disease is one side of the problem.

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In [9] , authors use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact of these interventions across 11 European countries. They assume that changes in the reproductive number a measure of transmission -are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. In particular, this model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death.",

Although these techniques are useful to highlight the magnitude of the crisis, they are not enough for mitigating the problem. Also, these are insufficient for decision-makers to anticipate the response to the virus propagation and evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented actions. For this reason, it is obvious that more efficient approaches are needed rapidly to i) model and forecast the spread and the consequences of the pandemic and ii) evaluate mitigation approaches that have been carried out. Data-driven models, see for example [20] , [21] , can be such solution [48] , [15] . Many data-based techniques can be applied. Nevertheless, regression models, as in [6] , are the main tools for forecasting the effect of Covid-19, ranging from classical machine learning approaches like linear regression [38] and Gaussian processes [16] to sophisticated models based on neuronal networks [11] . Variable screening can also help to detect the parameters that impact more on the propagation of the virus. These techniques require sufficient and high-quality data to provide a good estimation. Depending on the model used, the quantity of data can vary notably from hundreds to millions of samples. Moreover, a wide variety of data is necessary for accomplishing a good model of a complex system like the Covid-19 pandemic. Data from different disciplines is required, which hinders the data collection task. We highlight three pillars of data-driven approaches for fighting Covid-19: i) informative variables for developing an accurate model, ii) objectives of the model: characterizing Covid-19 pandemic, epidemic models and forecasting, etc. and iii) its use for efficient decision making.",

For instance in New York City, it has been reported 5330 more deaths than expected in the last month 4 , only 3350 of these can be accounted for Covid-19 reasons. These figures suggest that there exist undercounting on the real number of deaths. Another example can found in Spain, where the \"Sistema de Monitorizacin de la Mortalidad diaria (MoMo) 5 system registers the total number of deaths under any circumstances.

The work use data on confirmed Covid-19 deaths from WHO and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed Covid-19 utilization data from different locations. The model for death rate is based on curve-fitting using Wuhan data, considered more stable. Then, from the projected death rates, the model estimates hospital service utilization using an individual-level microsimulation model. individuals requiring admission in hospital and date of admission, and the age-specific fraction of admissions requiring ICU care, by using the average age pattern. For the simulation of deaths, they used data from Italy, China, South Korea, and the US (they did not have enough data only from the USA at the time of developing the model). The main outputs of the model are: the number of deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. The main conclusion of the work is that the epidemic will cause an unmanageable load on health systems in the US in the following weeks. A web service, where the projections of the model can be determined for each country and for the following four months, is available 23 . The information provided is: i) hospital resources needs, including the number of beds, the number of ICU beds, and ventilators; ii) the number of death per day, and iii) the total number of deaths.",

We enumerate different open data sets (and their corresponding repositories) related to Covid-19 cases at a worldwide scale, but also at a more regional level.
