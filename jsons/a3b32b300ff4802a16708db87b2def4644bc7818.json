Compared to other respiratory 4 viruses however, the frequency of reported olfactory disorders in coronavirus infections was lower 5 so far and has never been a serious health issue [2,3,4]. 6 During an acute URTI, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea are commonly accompanied by a temporary 7 smell loss of varying severity. Significant olfactory loss without rhinitic symptoms however, is 8 comparatively rare and points towards damage of the olfactory epithelium. URTI-associated smell 9 loss typically occurs after the fifth decade of life and becomes apparent to the patients several days studies, a different pattern is seen in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 1 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Smell and/or taste loss have been observed in 5-80% of these patients 1 3",
