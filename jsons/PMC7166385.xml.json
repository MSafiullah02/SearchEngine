In order to clarify the detailed site of interactions between the two heptad repeats, and acquire accurate information for the SARS\u2010CoV S protein fusion core, we have designed synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins that cover both of the HR1 and HR2 regions to study the corresponding protein\u2013protein interactions. Three synthetic peptides were synthesized: HR1\u2010a (residues 899\u2013926), HR1\u2010b (residues 916\u2013950), and HR2 (residues 1,151\u20131,185), based on the interacting site of HR1 and HR2 suggested by Tripet et al. 2004 (Fig. 1). Three recombinant proteins were designed according to Xu et al. 2004b: His6\u2010HR1 (residues 899\u2013958), GST\u2010HR2 or GST\u2010removed\u2010HR2 (residues 1,145\u20131,192) and HR\u20102\u2010Helix.

HR2 is negatively charged (pH 6.8) and it enters the gel to give a single band (Fig. 2, lane 1). In contrast, HR1\u2010a carries zero charge and HR1\u2010b is positively charged at pH 6.8. Both HR1\u2010a and HR1\u2010b did not enter the gel and could not be visualized upon native gel electrophoresis (lanes 2\u20135). When HR1\u2010b was pre\u2010incubated with HR2, an extra band of lower mobility was observed. The relative intensity of the resulting protein bands correlated stochiometrically to the molar ratio of HR1\u2010b/HR2 sample mixtures (lanes 6 and 7). No mobility shift of the HR2 band was observed when HR2 was incubated with HR1\u2010a (lanes 8 and 9). The absence of complex formation between HR2 and HR1\u2010a is consistent with the absence of inter\u2010chain interactions between HR2 and the N\u2010terminal region of HR\u20101 reported previously [Liu et al., 2004; Supekar et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a,b].

This is consistent with the results reported by Tripet et al. 2004, where enhanced helical content was observed when 50% TFE or equal molar quantity of a peptide equivalent to HR2 was added to a peptide with the same sequence of HR1\u2010b. No significant changes of ellipticity was observed when equal molar HR1\u2010a and HR2 were mixed (result not shown). Thermal denaturation experiments revealed that specific inter\u2010chain interactions were present between HR1\u2010b and HR2. The melting temperature (Tm) of HR2 was 36.3\u00b0C (Fig. 3B). When equal molar of HR1\u2010b was added to HR2, the Tm increased by 23.2\u201359.5\u00b0C (Fig. 3C).",

In vitro binding interference assays showed that ADS\u2010J1 interfered with the interactions between HR1 and HR2. From the X\u2010ray crystal structures of the SARS\u2010CoV S protein fusion core, there is a deep pocket located within the relatively deep grooves on the surface of central HR1 coiled\u2010coil (Phe909 to Leu927) [Liu et al., 2004; Supekar et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a; Duquerroy et al., 2005]. This structural pocket is conserved among heptad repeat region of class I membrane fusion proteins. It has been suggested that the presence of the pocket is important for adapting alternative conformations during fusogenesis [Duquerroy et al., 2005]. Anti\u2010HIV drugs, such as T20, have been developed to target this deep groove [Kilby et al., 1998]. The X\u2010ray crystal structures of SARS\u2010CoV S core peptides showed that four hydrophobic residues from HR2 (Leu1168, Val1171, Leu1175, and Leu1179) penetrate into the deep pocket consisting of Phe909 to Leu920 of HR1 and make extensive hydrophobic contacts with each other (Fig. 7). This region was chosen to be the drug target site for our in silico molecular modeling studies.",

            "text": "All 3D molecular modeling studies were performed on an Insight II molecular modeling platform (Accelrys Software, Inc., USA) running on Silicon Graphics Octane2 workstations (Silicon Graphics, Inc., USA). The consistent valence force field (CVFF) was selected in all the simulations. The structure of the anti\u2010HIV\u20101 agent ADS\u2010J1 was constructed with BUILDER module. In this module, the two\u2010dimensional image of ADS\u2010J1 was constructed using SKETCHER and was automatically converted into a three\u2010dimensional model by CONVERTER. The X\u2010ray crystal structure of the SARS\u2010CoV S protein fusion core (PDB 1WNC) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) and used as a starting model. One of the HR1 helices from the six\u2010helix coiled\u2010coil bundle was extracted to generate the target site for docking of ADS\u2010J1. Hydrogen atoms were added to the HR1 structure using the BUILDER module. Force field potentials and partial charges were then assigned for both of the structures of HR1 and ADS\u2010J1. These structures were energy\u2010minimized separately using the DISCOVER module and used as the pre\u2010docking structures. A distance\u2010dependent dielectric constant of 80.0 (aqueous solvent) and non\u2010bonded distance cutoff of 20 \u00c5 were used throughout the energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation. Initially, the structures of HR1 and ADS\u2010J1 were minimized for 5,000 iterations of steepest descent energy minimization. Molecular dynamics simulations were applied to the resulting structures: the energy\u2010minimized structures were equilibrated at 300 K for 10 picoseconds (ps) and then subjected to 100\u2010ps dynamics simulations at the same temperature with sampling steps of 1 femtosecond (fs). According to information derived from the X\u2010ray crystallographic structure of the fusion core [Supekar et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004a; Duquerroy et al., 2005], four hydrophobic residues from the HR2 (Leu1168, Val1171, Leu1175, and Leu1179) penetrate into one of the three hydrophobic deep pockets or cavities formed between Phe909 and Leu920 on the deep groove region of HR1 (Fig. 8). Therefore, the region containing all residues (5.0 \u00c5 radius) around this deep pocket was selected as the target site (named HR1\u2010DP) and set up as a grid with the DOCKING module. The non\u2010bonded energetics of this region was pre\u2010calculated on the grid. ADS\u2010J1 was first docked into HR1\u2010DP by manual docking using the DOCKING module. The best docking position was based on the docking energy of the ADS\u2010J1/HR1\u2010DP complex. Thousand of orientations of ADS\u2010J1 were searched by maneuvering it in the HR1\u2010DP manually until the energy minimum was found. The resultant complex was subjected to energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation using the DISCOVER module. An 8.0 \u00c5 cutoff for the calculation of non\u2010bonded interactions and the distance\u2010dependent dielectric constant of 80.0 (aqueous solvent) and non\u2010bonded distance cutoff of 20 \u00c5 were used throughout the energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation. Initially, the complex was minimized for 5,000 iterations of steepest descent energy minimization. The resulting structure was then used as a starting point for sampling conformational space using molecular dynamics. The energy\u2010minimized complex was equilibrated at 300 K for 10 ps. Following this, a 100 ps dynamics simulation was carried out at the same temperature, and the structure was sampled at steps of 1 fs. The sampled structure was subsequently energy\u2010minimized using conjugate gradient minimization. Ultimately, the total docking energy between ADS\u2010J1 and HR1\u2010DP in the energy minimized complex was calculated using the DOCKING module. van der Waals and electrostatic energies were included in the docking.",
