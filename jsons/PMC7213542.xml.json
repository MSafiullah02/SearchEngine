            "text": "Twenty years ago, the leading article in the very first issue of the Journal of Educational Change, of which I was founding Editor-in-Chief, was by Michael Fullan, who invented the entire field of educational change. Fullan presented an argument that both noted and nudged forward what he called \u201cThe Return of Large Scale Reform\u201d (Fullan 2000). Commenting on and drawing together evaluations of large-scale reform efforts in large school districts, across huge networks or collaboratives of schools, and within the policies of whole nations, Fullan set out 8 key lessons that could be derived from this collection of reforms. One of these lessons was the importance of combining pressure and support in implementing change. Pointing to research by Hill and Cr\u00e9vola (1999) on literacy improvement in a Catholic system in Victoria, Australia, and also on the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy in the UK (Barber 2009), Fullan (2000: 24) argued that accountability, targets and testing were a big part of the pressure-support mix. A standards-based approach to systemic change on a significant scale, Fullan claimed, held promise if schools, districts and nations set out to\u201cDetermine standards and set system-wide and school-specific, year-by-year targets\u201d;\u201cFocus school support services and available funds on achieving the standards and targets\u201d;\u201cPut in place accountability and incentive arrangements linked to performance against standards and targets\u201d; and\u201cConduct periodic full-cohort testing to monitor performance against the standards and targets\u201d.",

However, from the late 1990s onwards, large-scale educational reform in many countries became synonymous with only one side of Fullan\u2019s pressure-support equation, and emphasized standards, targets and what came to be known as high-stakes testing, within systems driven by top-down accountability or pressure.",

Like high stakes testing, mid-stakes testing uses large-scale assessments to report on the progress of schools and systems, and to guide districts\u2019 and schools\u2019 improvement efforts. It also reports these results online to inform parents\u2019 choice of school and, in various ways, to compare schools\u2019 performance. However, mid-stakes testing does not come with the punitive consequences of high-stakes testing, such as firing principals and teachers, or closing low-performing schools. Writing about mid-stakes testing in South Korea, Lee and Kang (2019: 4) describe the government\u2019s move from a high-stakes to mid-stakes strategy in 2013 as one involving reduction in the number of testing points, and abolition of uses of the tests for evaluating schools.",

It provides new evidence from two projects covering almost a 10-year time-span (Hargreaves et al. 2012, 2018) which shows that even though mid-stakes testing is milder in its manifestations and effects than high-stakes testing, legitimate concerns remain about the need for and side effects of such testing. These concerns have not yet been expressed in most of the international research and policy analysis concerning Ontario\u2019s educational system where Ontario has largely been positively presented as an exemplary case in which \u201cempowered educators\u201d demonstrate how excellence and equity can be combined to raise performance and narrow achievement gaps (Campbell et al. 2017; Tucker 2019: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2011). Problematic aspects of Ontario\u2019s system\u2014in particular, the nature and side-effects of its mid-stakes testing processes\u2014have largely been omitted from these accounts, in ways that could prove misleading for other systems interested in adopting some or all of Ontario\u2019s reform model.",

Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong, for example, have globally renowned strong teaching professions and unified governmental and societal commitments to education for public good (Tucker 2019: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2011), but their high performance is also accompanied by a vast shadow system of private after-school tutoring and cramming for traditional examination and test success (Ng 2017; Bray 2006). Without careful and critical appraisals of high performing systems based on all relevant scientific evidence, there is a risk that global policy advocacy regarding these systems and their characteristics will be based on political ideology and opinion rather than on the full span of empirical research. In this respect, it is time for a critical appraisal of mid-stakes testing and how it is viewed by Ontario\u2019s educators so that a more balanced representation of Ontario\u2019s strengths and weaknesses as a high performing system is attained.",

Its original contribution is to advance a new line of interpretation that synthesizes the evidence from Ontario for a reconsideration of mid-stakes testing and its effects as a policy strategy. Especially given the prominence and popularity of Ontario as a system that is frequently cited by global policy organizations such as the OECD (2011) and the US National Center for Education and the Economy (Tucker 2011) as one of a very small number of educational systems that are both high performing and quite equitable, and that hosts numerous teams of educators and policy makers from overseas, a critical, balanced and evidence-based appraisal is long overdue.",

I teach what my students need to know (whether mainstream, accommodated, or modified) based on curriculum and in a way that meets their needs. If that helps them in EQAO, great, if not, there are more important lessons to learn than getting a good mark on EQAO.However, while some felt that the Drive to 75 had led to distorted priorities, in closed-ended responses, educators indicated that this had not ultimately affected their own practices.",

Other areas of excellence were now added to literacy and mathematics as priorities, like the Arts and STEM. Equity was a third priority alongside excellence and public confidence, but it was no longer interpreted just as narrowing achievement gaps. Equity now encompassed inclusion of diverse and vulnerable groups and their identities, such as indigenous, refugee and LGBTQ students, so they could see themselves, their communities, and their needs reflected in the life and learning of their schools.

In light of these developments, the benefits of EQAO for monitoring progress and stimulating higher expectations for achievement now appear to have been outweighed by the harmful consequences for broad excellence, equity and well-being. The strengthening of Ontario\u2019s culture of collaborative professionalism has eased or even eliminated tendencies to concentrate undue attention on marker students just below the point of proficiency, in favour of more authentic inquiry into the genuine strengths of and struggles among students of mystery and wonder. But, aside from this, the twentieth century large-scale assessment system has not kept up with twenty first century goals for deeper learning and young people\u2019s development. Instead, there is teaching to the test, cultural bias, avoidance of innovation in the years during and prior to the ones where tests are administered, subjection of teachers to heartbreaking dilemmas of whether to include highly vulnerable students in the testing process or not, and active creation of emotional ill-being among students and teachers alike. A twenty first century movement in deeper learning and stronger well-being that is embracing a range of innovative practices has been rapidly out-pacing Ontario\u2019s twentieth century system of large-scale, mid-stakes assessment.",

Promoting well-being while continuing to perpetuate ill-being through large-scale, standardized assessment practices, runs contrary to the goals of achieving systemic coherence, and corrodes the sense of moral purpose that high performing systems proclaim and promote.

In this respect, with regard to the wider field of educational change and assessment, while the work of Fullan and myself had undergone a considerable divergence in the first decade and a half of the twenty first century during the Age of Achievement and Effort, it has reached a new convergence in the latter part of this second decade.",

But when educational goals for learning and well-being become broader and deeper, as many contemporary system goals have become in an Age of Engagement, Identity and Wellbeing, the evidence of this research on their use in Ontario, is that this 20-year old strategy of accountability and systemic improvement is now an educationally ineffective and systemically incoherent anachronism.",
