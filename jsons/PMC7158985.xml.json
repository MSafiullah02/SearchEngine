In a previously reported family cluster, most infected individuals had clinical symptoms, decreased lymphocyte counts, and abnormal chest CT images, and were positive for the virus on quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.2, 3 However, some of the family members had abnormal chest CT images and positive qRT-PCR results without any clinical symptoms.3 Here, we report the clinical characteristics of a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this family of three, one 35-year-old man (patient 1) had clinical symptoms, a decreased lymphocyte count, abnormal chest CT images, and a positive result on qRT-PCR. By contrast, the other two family members\u2014a 33-year-old woman (patient 2) and a 3-year-old boy (patient 3)\u2014were both asymptomatic, with normal lymphocyte counts and chest CT images but positive qRT-PCR results (figure\n).",

On Jan 26, patient 1 developed a fever of 37\u00b75\u00b0C, which lasted for 1 day. The next day, the patient presented to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University with a body temperature of 37\u00b74\u00b0C, and on the same day developed a sore throat, arthralgia, and myalgia, without chills or headache. Patient 1 was observed from Jan 27 to Jan 29, during which time his body temperature normalised. On Jan 27, routine blood tests showed normal white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, but decreased lymphocyte percentage (appendix). Chest CT scans taken 2 days after symptom onset showed bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of ground-glass opacities and consolidation (appendix). Two sets of nasopharyngeal swab samples from patient 1 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on qRT-PCR.",

Importantly, asymptomatic patients (such as patients 2 and 3) might be unaware of their disease and therefore not isolate themselves or seek treatment, or they might be overlooked by health-care professionals and thus unknowingly transmit the virus to others.",
