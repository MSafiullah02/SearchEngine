            "text": "Background: Postoperative pain has negative consequences on patients' outcomes after cardiac surgery. Routine management with opioid and or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications has several disadvantages. Dexmedetomidine is a selective \u03b12 agonist used for sedation and analgesia. The use of dexmedetomidine for postoperative pain management and decreasing delirium and agitation in cardiac surgery patients is a matter of debate. Our objective was to determine the role of an early administration of dexmedetomidine in decreasing opioid use post-cardiac surgery and its effects on the quality of postoperative recovery. Results: Medical records of 120 patients admitted to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in two cardiac centers between December 2015 and December 2016 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A included 55 patients who received dexmedetomidine in a dose of 0.2-0.4 mcg/kg/h on admission to CSICU, and group B included 65 patients who did not receive dexmedetomidine. The primary outcome was the pain score immediately after extubation, and the secondary outcomes included post-extubation sedation and pain scores for 12 h. There were significant decrease of the pain scores in dexmedetomidine group that continues through the 3rd, 6th, 8th, and 12th hour readings after surgery with mean modified Ramsay scores 0.1 \u00b1 0.0, 0.89 \u00b1 2.05, 0.35 \u00b1 0.1, and 0.12 \u00b1 1.1 respectively compared to 0.46 \u00b1 1.15, 3.46 \u00b1 2.93, 0.98 \u00b1 1.90, and 0.12 \u00b1 1.1 in group B (p < 0.001), significant decrease in cumulative morphine received (p < 0.001, OR = 909, 95% CI 0.05-0.19), favorable reduction in heart rate in dexmedetomidine group (80 \u00b1 1.9 b/min) compared to 96 \u00b1 8.8 b/min in the other group (p = 0.017), and smoother recovery from general anesthesia. Conclusion: Administration of dexmedetomidine in the early postoperative period can be safe. It may reduce the use of opioids, has sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic effects that could play a useful role during the management of coronary artery bypass patients, and may improve postoperative recovery.",

However, we thought these initial hemodynamic changes in MAP and HR were most probably related to post-surgical stress, the surgical procedures itself, or pre-existing hypertension as it happened in both groups [13] . The decrease in MAP and HR was Table 1 Comparison of the preoperative, operative, and postoperative data between groups (continuous data are presented as mean and standard deviation or median and categorical data as number and percent) related to more gradual central effect of DEX in patients who received it, while the reduction of MAP for patients who did not receive DEX and depended on morphine as main analgesic most probably was related to decreasing catecholamine and direct vasodilatation effect of morphine considering that there was no significant difference in the number of patients receiving inotropes and vasodilators between the two groups. Our findings were in line with Liu and coworkers' [14] meta-analysis, which stated that DEX lead to a shorter length of intubation, but it can be associated with bradycardia in patients after cardiac surgery compared with propofol. This tendency to lower the heart rate and systolic blood pressure with decreased incidence of tachycardia and arrhythmias have a cardioprotective effect, as stated by another meta-analysis by Gong and coauthors [15] .",

In our study, we did not find any difference between the two groups with regard to MAP and HR (p = 0.561 and 0.017, respectively). Barletta and associates [18] stated that DEX decreased cardiac index and HR for patients undergoing lengthy procedures which remained reduced at the time of discharge; our results did not support this conclusion as there was no significant difference between the two groups in HR. On the other hand, Maldonado and coworkers [19] concluded that DEX was associated with a lower rate of respiratory depression. It caused a higher rate of adverse hemodynamic events, which might be a concern in a hemodynamically unstable patient, but we did not observe any adverse effect on hemodynamic stability; this can be attributed to the low number of patients who needed inotropic support or vasodilator during the post-operative period in our cohort. Moreover, we have estimated opioid administration as analgesics postoperatively, which could reflect passively on the patients' hemodynamics post-CABG. We observed that 10% of the patients were in need of opioids in the DEX group. These patients could be considered to have a low pain threshold or the post-operative managing doctors had a low threshold to give his patients more analgesia.",

Moreover, the dose of opioids given in the DEX group was significantly less than those of the other group [20, 21] . The pattern of pain in both groups was almost the same, which means that DEX does not alter the trend of the pain but decreased the intensity, and both groups needed to receive analgesics at the same point according to pain score between 4 and 5.
