Radiation therapy for patients with breast cancer represents a significant proportion of treatment delivery workload in any radiation therapy department. Some centers may consider omission or deferral of radiation therapy in those patients perceived to have a lower risk of adverse outcomes, such as patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or early stage disease with low-risk features. However, with an unknown and potentially lengthy timeline for the pandemic, many patients and clinicians are not comfortable with these options. Modeling studies predict that this pandemic may take months to peak, and these heightened public health measures may remain in place for many months. 1 Therefore, strategies to adapt to this \"new normal\" are crucial to maintaining access to radiation therapy for patients with cancer. Our strategy is based on the appropriate use of hypofractionation and accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI).",

The evidence supporting APBI agrees with the American Society of Radiation Oncology 7 patient selection guidelines. Many centers have adopted the use of APBI in a limited capacity, primarily for patients on clinical trials. Publications describing APBI techniques that meet major trial constraints with simple 3dimensional conformal techniques, and more recently advanced techniques for improved dosimetry, are available to support radiation planning. 8 Implementing an APBI fractionation of 27 Gy in 5 fractions can save a further 10, 11, or 20 treatment visits for select patients.",

In consideration of COVID-19 and after a multidisciplinary review, our center is now offering a 5-fraction APBI option for eligible patients. 9 A review of the last 3 months of patient treatment data was performed at our institution to determine the impact of this change on radiation therapy resources. Across all tumor sites, 770 total patients were treated; of these, patients with breast cancer represented 30% of all delivered fractions. For our patient population, approximately 40% of patients with breast cancer are suitable candidates for APBI. Over a 3-month span, a 5-fraction regimen of APBI for these eligible patients with breast cancer could reduce the number of daily treatment visits by approximately 500 and 900 for 16-and 25-fraction regimens, respectively. Across all radiation therapy resources, this overall reduction is approximately 5% to 10% of total daily fractions.",
