This order is represented by two bacterial families: Rhodospirillaceae and Acetobacteraceae. In general, the etymology of members of the Acetobacteraceae family derives from the Latin acetum or acidum\ngluconicum + bacter due to their peculiar main characteristic to produce organic acids during many biotechnological processes, such as vinegar and wine productions. Bacteria of the genus Acetobacter are known since 1898 with the description of A. aceti\n1, 2. However, only at 1988, it means 100 years after the first species description in this family, is that a diazotrophic species was described in this family 3. At that time, this discovery raised the possibility that bacteria of many other species could also present nitrogen fixing and plant growth promotion properties for agricultural purpose, similar to the rhizobia inoculant for soybeans. This document brings the trajectory of accumulated knowledge about the species Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and other diazotrophs genera and species that were described later in this family.",

Further characterization of single and double mutants containing gus\u2010fusion suggested that GlnB and GlnK1 are required as positive signals to efficiently relieve repression by GlnK2. In addition, the authors showed that GlnK2 protein clearly has a function different from those of GlnB and GlnK1, since nif gene expression were repressed in glnB glnK1 double mutant under all conditions tested. Based on these studies, the authors suggested that none of the three PII homologs is required for nif gene expression indicating novel regulatory features of G. diazotrophicus PII proteins. The GlnK2 protein acts primarily as an inhibitor of nif gene expression while GlnB and GlnK1 control the expression of nif genes in response to ammonium availability, both directly and by relieving the inhibition by GlnK2 92.",

They observed that growth of this microorganism under nitrogen fixing condition leads to reduction of ROS accumulation and a strong induction of sodA, katE, kat, katC, and gorA genes in comparison to cells grown under non\u2010fixing condition. In addition, sodA and katE gene expression correlates with nifD suggesting that reduction of ROS is essential for the homeostasis during respiratory protection and nitrogen fixation in G. diazotrophicus. Later on, the participation of G. diazotrophicus detoxifying genes during the first step of root colonization was investigated using rice plants 111. It was shown that ROS accumulates during the first steps of inoculation of G. diazotrophicus wild type and mutant strains as response of a plant defense mechanism. Noteworthy, they found out that GR (glutathione reductase) and SOD (superoxide dismutase) mutants of G. diazotrophicus could not reduce efficiently the ROS accumulated in the period of 1\u20137 h after inoculation. In addition, they measured PR genes expression and detected that expression of JA/ET pathway gene increased during wild type\u2013plant interaction, but not to both mutants. These data suggest that G. diazotrophicus alters its redox metabolism during BNF by increasing antioxidant transcript levels to circumvent ROS inhibitory effect to nitrogenase activity. Probably this transcriptional regulatory mechanism protects nitrogenase activity during initial stages of plant colonization.",

Further, genome analyses revealed that genes of asparaginyl\u2010tRNA and asparagine synthetase orthologs are absent in the G. diazotrophicus genome. However, the correlation between repression of nifD expression and increase of Asparagine level indicated that genes for an alternative route that converts Asp\u2010tRNAAsn into Asn\u2010tRNAAsn by a glutamine\u2010dependent Asp\u2010tRNAAsn amidotransferase B, encoded by the operon gatCAB, might be present. In fact, in G diazotrophicus the presence of gatCAB operon indicates that the ORF GDI2232 encodes an Aspartyl\u2010tRNA synthetase of ND\u2010AspRS type 113. The role of asparagine and glutamine as N storage molecule in plant tissues, including sugarcane, is a general rule; however, their role in plant bacteria interaction is scarce and requires more investigation. The content of amino acids in sugarcane sap, apoplast, and symplast has been evaluated and shows that Asn is one of the most abundant 114, 115. It is known that Asn and Gln are amino acids that repress nitrogen fixation in vitro. Noteworthy, the presence of ORFs coding for putative l\u2010asparaginase precursor (GDI3138), l\u2010asparaginase II protein (GDI1250), and ORFs coding putative (aspartate) aminotransferase in G. diazotrophicus genome may represent an adaptive advantage to its endophytic behavior.

This bacterium is located in different parts of the plant as described by Reis et al. 79 and James et al. 120. They demonstrated during \u201cin vitro\u201d inoculation studies under controlled conditions, that G. diazotrophicus enters into sugarcane micropropagated plants through the tissue of secondary roots then the bacteria penetrated inner tissues and colonize the intercellular spaces (apoplast). Other possible points of infection are wounds and the stomata of sugarcane plants 121. It also colonizes tip of roots and root hairs of other plants such as wheat, sorghum, and rice as showed using reporter genes 123, 124. At field conditions, the main route of transmission is by vegetative multiplication of stem pieces of sugarcane, although the trash should also serve as an alternative inoculum source when incorporated into the soil 79. Another possibility to introduce this bacterium in plants appears to be related to the phloem sap sucking by the insects (mealybugs) presenting this species in the lymph and living within sugarcane leaves sheath pocket 82. Caballero\u2010Mellado and Mart\u00ednez\u2010Romero 83 hypothesized that these insects and also micorrhyzal spores could be responsible for local dispersion of this species within short distance while sugarcane setts and bud chips used to propagate sugarcane could carry the bacteria to further distant geographic regions. No further evidence that these insects are responsible for the dispersal of G. diazotrophicus species is reported, although it is plausible that this occurs.

The ability of G. diazotrophicus to fix nitrogen and growth promotion of sugarcane was evaluated by comparing plants inoculated with the wild type (PAL5T) and an Nif mutant (MAd3A\u2014carry a nifD mutation) in two experiments 128. Both, the type strain and the mutant, colonized sugarcane plants and persisted in mature plants. Under conditions of nitrogen deficiency, plants inoculated with PAL5T generally grew better and had a higher content of total nitrogen 60 days after planting when compared to plant inoculated with the Nif mutant. These results indicate that the transfer of fixed nitrogen from G. diazotrophicus to sugarcane may be an important mechanism for the growth promotion in this association.

One of the first reports that populations of diazotrophs could be affected by increasing doses of N\u2010fertilizer was made by Vose et al. 158 in sugarcane which showed that high levels of mineral N caused a significant reduction in the acetylene reduction activity, very popular method which measures the indirect activity of the nitrogenase enzyme acting as a competitive inhibitor. This effect was believed to inhibit this enzyme synthesis. In 1993, after the description of G. diazotrophicus, studies conducted in Mexico by Fuentes\u2010Ram\u00edrez et al. 159 reported that the association between G. diazotrophicus and sugarcane could be severely limited by high N\u2010fertilization, which would explain the decrease in acetylene reduction activity. In their study, the crops fertilized with 120 kg N ha\u22121 showed higher number of isolates than the plots fertilized with 300 kg N ha\u22121, levels not applied in Brazil. Muthukumarasamy et al. 160, 161 obtained similar results in India for G. diazotrophicus. They suggest that this effect was not directly related to the presence of high levels of nitrogen fertilizer in sugarcane crop since this bacterium is able to grow and fix nitrogen \u201cin vitro\u201d in presence of high concentrations of NO3 (60 mM). It is more likely that at these high N doses the physiological state of the plant undergoes changes and subsequently influences negatively the population of this organism. Mu\u00f1oz\u2010Rojas and Caballero\u2010Mellado 162 observed a negative effect on G. diazotrophicus population in the presence of high doses of nitrogen appled in sugarcane planted in Mexico. These results were confirmed by Reis Jr. et al. 163 using two sugarcane varieties planted in a sand soil fertilized with 300 kg de N ha\u22121 in comparison with the control without N application. Only the variety SP792312 presented plant with high levels of total N in the fertilized plots and lower numbers of G. diazotrophicus.

The strategy to isolate and identify new species generally is not based on criteria of biological nitrogen fixation ability and this character is not a discriminatory one. Interestingly, we observed that some researcher groups used the nitrogen free LGI medium as a strategy to obtain new isolates. It is expected that using N\u2010free medium during isolation process can enrich populations of nitrogen fixing bacteria leading to recovery of many of them from environmental samples. In addition, the original pH of LGI was 5.5, but several new species were described with a simple modification of the final pH to levels lower than 5.0. Since representatives of this family are adapted to acidic environment, lowering pH can be considered another strategy used by many authors to isolate and describe new species of nitrogen fixing Acetobacteraceae.",

G. diazotrophicus is the most studied nitrogen fixing bacteria of this family for agricultural application. Since the beginning, several studies describing its survival, habitats, mode of plant colonization, and transference to new hosts have accumulated in the literature. Based on them, the description of G. diazotrophicus as a true endophyte was proposed and accepted. The endophytic behavior of G. diazotrophicus is based on many ecological surveys and studies while these data are lacking to other species described. Actually, nowadays publications of ecological research are an exception when we compare with the increasing numbers of species description mainly based on a set of physiological and molecular data, small numbers of specimens or even only one representative.",

Besides nitrogen fixation ability, G. diazotrophicus also produces growth hormones such as auxins and gibberellins and also can be considered PGPB when compared to A. brasilense. In agricultural perspective the application of Acetobacteraceae species can contribute to plant growth and improve nitrogen assimilation of the host plant. However, under field conditions the effect of the number of bacteria in the plant versus the contribution of biological nitrogen fixation and/or plant growth promotion is not clearly established. It is already reported that introduced populations can undergo changes not only on their physiological aspects, but also in genomic aspects. So far, over more than 30 years of studies most of the knowledge of these aspects of the bacterium\u2013plant interaction is based on analysis conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.",
