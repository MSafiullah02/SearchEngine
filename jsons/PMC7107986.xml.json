All illnesses were diagnosed at the Seoul National University Children's Hospital (Korea) or the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Korea) between September 2000 and August 2005. Samples obtained from children with major risk factors other than recurrent episodes of wheezing were excluded, as were those obtained from children with hospital-related infections. Diagnostic definitions were as follows [12, 13]: pneumonia required rales on auscultation or demonstration of an infiltrate by chest X-ray; bronchiolitis was characterized by a cough, tachypnea, retraction, and expiratory wheezes, often accompanied by rales; and croup required a barking cough with stridor. The principal investigator determined the clinical diagnosis on the basis of a review of medical records conducted by 5 of the investigators. The predominant clinical diagnosis was determined when >1 diagnosis was present.",

The detection sensitivity of the assay for 5 viruses (RSV, PIV-1, PIV-3, hMPV, and influenza viruses A and B) was greatest for influenza A, with a value of 10-4 TCID50. Similarly, the assay detected 5 \u00d7 10-3 TCID50 of RSV and PIV-3 and 10-3 TCID50 of PIV-1, hMPV, and influenza B. Detectable viral RNA concentrations for rhinovirus, coronaviruses OC43 and 229E, HCoV-NL63, and HBoV were 5\u201310 ng of the total RNA extracted from the cell culture supernatants or clinical specimens. Of the 515 samples tested, 312 (60.6%) were positive for any of the 11 respiratory viruses (table 2). The detection rate of multiplex RT-PCR was increased because of additional viruses that can be detected by this method and because of greater sensitivity, compared with viral culture or antigen detection methods. Of these 312 virus-positive samples, 36 were also positive for additional viruses, resulting in a coinfection rate of 11.5%. Virus frequencies were as follows: RSV was detected in 122 children (23.7%), HBoV in 58 (11.3%), adenovirus in 35 (6.8%), PIV-3 in 32 (6.2%), rhinovirus in 30 (5.8%), hMPV in 24 (4.7%), influenza A in 24 (4.7%), PIV-1 in 9 (1.7%), influenza B in 9 (1.7%), HCoV-NL63 in 8 (1.6%), and conventional HCoV in 1 (replicase 1a gene sequencing analysis revealed this to be HCoV-OC43). Rhinoviruses were found to be associated with acute LRTI at a relatively high frequency. The prevalence of hMPV was similar to that of influenza virus A.

In view of the observation that adenovirus was more frequently found in patients with mixed viral infections (13 [37.1%] of 35 adenovirus-positive samples) than were the other viruses, the above findings indicate that HBoV was associated with high rates of mixed infections. Viruses that were frequently found to be coinfecting with HBoV were as follows, in descending order: adenovirus (7 cases), hMPV (5 cases), RSV (5 cases), and PIV-3 (3 cases). HBoV was identified throughout each year during the 5-year study period, with a peak (57% of total isolates) occurring from May to July, and the mean age of HBoV-infected children was 22.3 months. The clinical diagnoses of 36 HBoV-associated LRTIs were bronchiolitis for 9 patients (25%), pneumonia for 20 patients (55.6%), croup for 3 patients (8.3%), and asthma exacerbation for 4 patients (11.1%).",

In addition, the majority of previous studies have used molecular methods to investigate the roles of hMPV and HCoV-NL63 in acute respiratory diseases by using subjects that differ with respect to the number of respiratory specimens tested or results obtained by viral culture or by antigen detection methods [22, 27].

This observation may reflect differences in diagnostic definitions or study populations between reports; nonetheless, the present study indicates that hMPV is a common virus detected in bronchiolitis patients, because it was found in an additional 3 patients among 4 who were coinfected with other viruses.",

The present study indicates that HCoV-NL63 is a less common respiratory pathogen in cases of acute LRTIs in Korean children. In fact, HCoV-NL63 only accounted for 1.6% of cases, and HCoV-OC 43 was rarely found. However, despite the small number of children identified with HCoV-NL63 infection, when it was found, it was frequently associated with croup (3 of 6 cases). Moreover, the proportion of HCoV-NL63\u2013positive croup cases was found to be similar to the proportion of cases caused by influenza virus or PIV-1, which are the 2 most common causes of croup in the fall and winter seasons [3, 34]. These findings suggest that HCoV-NL63 is an important etiologic agent of croup during the spring in Korea.",

Therefore, we could not determine the population-based prevalence. Viruses associated with low prevalence and mild symptoms may not be fully described, either. However, comparable numbers of the archived samples were selected in each study year; thus, we believe that the data obtained in the present study may represent the overall activities of viruses responsible for acute LRTIs and their epidemiologic characteristics. During the 5-year observation period, hMPV infection appeared to be rare in the 1-year period of 2003\u20132004. This finding suggests that hMPV-associated LRTIs are subject to annual variations, which contrasts with the relatively stable annual incidence of RSV infections [35, 36]. These results may be the consequence of spurious observations affected by the selection bias of this study. However, annual variability has also been demonstrated in other studies of periods of only 2 or 3 years and of archived samples during a longer period [26, 37, 38]. Additional prospective studies are needed to characterize the epidemiologic features of hMPV infection.",

The number of HBoV infections peaked slightly later than the number of PIV-3 infections, and during its peak months, the total prevalence of the other 10 viral agents excluding HBoV was 34.7% (50 cases among 144 nasopharyngeal aspirates), which is lower than the overall detection rate. The detection rate of 11 viruses during the same period increased from 34.7% to 59%, similar to that of the total detection rate of 60.6%. These findings suggest that HBoV is a major viral agent of respiratory episodes during late spring to early summer. However, the issue of a causal relationship remains unresolved. It is noteworthy that the detection of HBoV DNA was associated with a higher rate of coinfection than other viral agents. As demonstrated above, the prevalence of coinfection of HBoV was similar to that of adenovirus, which is frequently observed as a copathogen because of its long shedding period. In 2 previous studies, HBoV has also been found with other agents with prevalences of 17.5% and 55.6% [11, 19]. Thus, HBoV infection might occur incidentally to respiratory infections caused by other viral agents. At the present time, despite the periodicity shown by HBoV, its role as a true pathogen remains uncertain. Additional studies are required to determine its asymptomatic prevalence in the population, pathogenicity, and viral shedding characteristics.",
