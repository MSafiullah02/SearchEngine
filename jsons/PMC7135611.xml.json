They provide a pertinent review of the impact of these changes on the epidemiology of communicable diseases in eastern Europe, particularly tuberculosis and HIV, and the constraints facing frail health-systems to adequately respond. Threats that appeared distant are now near. Diseases of antiquity (tuberculosis) and those of exotic and far-flung destinations are now a neighbourhood reality. Thus the call for increased political commitment by member states of the EU to tackle the challenges of establishing effective surveillance for communicable disease across frontiers and bolstering the health systems of EU neighbours is sensible, whether prompted by self-preservation, chauvinism, or benevolence. However, this action alone will not suffice to minimise the risk of importation of communicable diseases, particularly those with outbreak potential, into the EU, nor is it morally defensible. A global threat calls for an equitable global response.",

The resulting concern prompted several key international and regional initiatives, most notably the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). GOARN was established in 1997 and now has over 120 partners around the world that identify and assist in responses to more than 50 epidemics, predominantly in developing countries, each year.3 The draft revision of the international health regulations places emphasis on effective sharing of epidemiological information on trans-boundary spread of communicable diseases and rapid assistance to member states to support responses.2\n",

The value of training key health-personnel at district level to actively monitor the occurrence of a limited number of clinical syndromes and appropriately respond, while sustaining the surveillance system through regular training, networking, and feedback to reporters, weekly zero-reporting, and defined action on all reports, has been convincingly shown in several developing settings.5, 6 Recently, encouraging evidence has been gathered in west Africa to confirm what appears obvious, that strengthening health services to effectively detect and control epidemics of measles, cholera, and meningococcal meningitis is cost effective.7\n",
