It is evident from the table that the calculated ADF statistics are less than their critical values (obtained from Mackinnon 1991 tables), suggesting that the variables are not level stationary for all cases. This suspicion finds evidence of support when the results on the first difference of the series are examined. Which prove the hypothesis that the series being stationary or I(1). This finding is corroborated by the \u03b7 \u03bc and \u03b7 \u03c4 of the KPSS test. The results of KPSS test as reported in Table 4 .4, rejects the null hypothesis of level and trend stationarity. However, the KPSS statistics does not reject the I(0) hypothesis for the first differences of the series at different levels of significance. Therefore, the combined results from both tests (ADF and KPSS) suggest that all series under consideration appear to be integrated of order 1, I(1). 4 Having established that the variables are integrated of the same order of I(1), we then proceed with the cointegration tests in testing for the cointegration among the series. The Johansen and Juselius (JJ) approach is employed to test whether there is any cointegrated relationship among the selected variables. The results of the Johansen test for cointegration are summarized in Table 4 .5. Note: The \u03b7-statistics refer to the KPSS test, where the subscripts \u03bc and \u03c4 indicate the model that allows for a drift term and model with both a drift and a deterministic trend respectively. * * and * denote rejection of a unit root hypothesis based on Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) critical values at 1% and 5% respectively. Figures in the square brackets indicate the lag length. KPSS tests the stationarity null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis of a unit root.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1194, "end": 1195, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1869, "text": "Kwiatkowski et al.

Therefore, the hypothesis of no cointegrating vector is rejected at conventional significance levels for both countries. Rejecting the null hypothesis of no cointegration between the I(1) variables implies that the variables do not drift apart in the long-run. Therefore, there is a long run relationship. Table 4 .6 reports the results of long-run elasticity estimates, which is obtained by normalizing with respect to total tourist arrivals. The results are consistent with the previous studies (Narayan, 2003a; Salman 2003) . The results reveal that incomes in the tourists' country of origin have a positive influence on tourist arrivals to Malaysia. The income elasticity is greater than one in both cases. A 1% increase in income of tourists' country of origin, increases tourist arrivals to Malaysia by 1.73% and 2.35% from the US and the UK respectively. The results also indicate that tourists from these markets are sensitive to the relative price of tourism in Malaysia. Moreover, tourists from the UK are more responsive to changes in relative prices of tourism in Malaysia than tourists from the US. In terms of prices in the competing destinations, the findings reveal that Thailand and the Philippines are complementary destination for Malaysia, while Singapore is Malaysia's substitute destination. The results indicate that a 1% increase in the relative prices of tourism in Singapore will increase tourist arrivals from the US and the UK to Malaysia by 1.71% and 2.74% respectively. On the other hand, an increase in the relative prices of tourism in Thailand and the Philippines will decrease tourist arrivals from the US and the UK to Malaysia. Using the information provided by the Johansen cointegration test, an error correction model (ECM) is constructed to obtain the short-run elasticities. The coefficient of the error correction term represents the speed of adjustment back to the long-run relationship among the variables. In other words, this shows how quickly the system will return to equilibrium after a random shock. It is expected to be negative to ensure convergence. As stated by Hendry (1995) , in general to specific modeling approach, the initial step is to set the value of lags of the explanatory variables, and then delete the most insignificant differenced variables. Therefore, in this study we start the estimates by using 4 lags and tried various values of lags. After several estimations, the model that fits the data best is presented in Table 4 .7. The final results of the error correction term (EC t-1 ) as presented in Table 4 .7 passed the diagnostic tests. The Jarque-Bera statistics fails to reject the null hypothesis at 1% significance level confirming the normality of residuals.
