            "text": "In the present study, an IBV strain I0305/19 was isolated from a diseased commercial broiler flock in 2019 in China with high morbidity and mortality. The isolate I0305/19 was clustered together with viruses in sublineage D of GI-19 lineage on the basis of the complete S1 sequence analysis. Isolate I0305/19 and other viruses isolated in China have the amino acid sequence MIA at positions 110 -112 in the S protein. Further analysis based on the complete genomic sequence showed that the isolate emerged through at least four recombination events between GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848-and GI-13 4/91-like strains, in which the S gene was found to be similar to that of the GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848-like strain. Pathological assessment showed the isolate was a nephropathogenic IBV strain that caused high morbidity of 100% and mortality of 80% in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. The isolate I0305/19 exhibited broader tropisms in different tissues, including tracheas, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, liver, kidneys, proventriculus, small intestines, large intestines, cecum, and cecal tonsils. Furthermore, subpopulations of the challenge virus were found in tissues of infected chickens; this finding is important in understanding how the virulent IBV strains can potentially replicate and evolve to cause disease. This information is also valuable for understanding the mechanisms of replication and evolution of other coronaviruses such as the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.",

Vaccines against IB are often used to reduce economic losses due to infection with field strains. However, the IB virus exists in a wide range of antigenically and genetically distinct types, and the continuous emergence of new J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f genotypes, lineages, serotypes, and variants of IBV makes the prevention and control of this pathogen both complex and challenging.",

            "text": "Recently, a classification scheme based on the complete S1 sequence phylogenetic analysis categorized IBV strains into 36 lineages grouped in seven genotypes: GI-1~GI-29, GII-1, GII-2, and GIII-1~GVII-1 (Valastro et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2019; Molenaar et al., 2020) . GI-19 is the most widely distributed lineage worldwide. To date, the largest number of IBV strains in poultry producing countries originates from the GI-19 lineage (Valastro et al., 2016) . The GI-19 strain, so-called QXIBV strain, was detected in China in 1996 when it was temporarily termed as glandular stomach-type IB strain due to the characteristic lesions in the glandular stomach of the infected chickens (Wang et al., 1998) . Since then, several strains belonging to this lineage have been isolated and molecularly characterized from many cases of infection and designated as a new genotype, LX4 type; in China, these strains have been identified as nephropathogenic as they cause clinical nephritis and gross kidney lesions in infected specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens (Liu and Kong, 2004) . According to a retrospective study, the first isolated GI-19 strain is the ck/CH/LHLJ/95I strain, which was isolated in 1995 from China . However, a recently submitted sequence of an IBV strain 58HeN-93II (i.e., this strain was recently reported with accession number KC577395) shows that the lineage had originated in China in 1993. The GI-19 strain was shown to be the dominant IBV lineage in chicken flocks in China since it was detected (Liu and Kong, 2004; Zou et al., 2010; Han et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Fan et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2019).",

First, the viral titers were tested in 11 tissues, including tracheas, lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, liver, kidneys, proventriculus, small intestines, large intestines, cecum, and cecal tonsils, by using 9-day-old SPF chickens, and the total amount of infectious viruses recovered from the entire organ were calculated. As shown in Fig. 4B , the log10 titers of infectious virus were below 2.0 only in the spleens and livers of the infected chickens. In contrast, the log10 titers of the challenge virus in the remaining nine organs were 3.0 or greater. No virus was recovered in the tissues of negative control chickens. Second, the 11 tissues of the dead chickens were subjected to IHC for detecting the presence of IBV antigen using a monoclonal antibody directed against the N protein. As shown in Fig. 5 , the IBV antigen was positive in seven of the 11 selected tissues, including trachea, the secondary bronchus in the lung, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, kidneys, small intestines, large intestines, and cecal tonsils. No IHC-positive staining for IBV antigen was observed in the tissues of birds in the negative control group.",

The results showed that the sequence of the S1 gene of the challenge I0305/19 virus had not changed in the kidneys and cecal tonsils of all the 10 infected chickens after replication of virus. However, there were five differences between the S1 nucleotide sequences of the challenge I0305/19 strain and the virus isolated from tissues of some infected chickens (Fig. 6 ). Of these five changes, one major nucleotide peak was found at position 278 in the S1 gene of the virus from the bursa of Fabricius and small and large intestines of two infected birds (the first and sixth birds), which resulted in a change of Phe93 to Ser93. Another major nucleotide peak was observed at position 353 in the virus from proventriculi and lungs of two infected birds (the fourth and eighth birds), which led to a change of Gly118 to Asp118. The sequences of the S1 gene had not changed in the remaining nine tissues of most of the infected chickens. These results suggested mixed subpopulations after replication of the challenge I0305/19 virus in some of the infected chickens.",

In addition, only very mild respiratory signs were observed in both the commercial broilers and the SPF chickens infected with isolate I0305/19; however, other reports demonstrated that the GI-19 viruses could induce obvious respiratory signs (Liu and Kong et al., 2004; Benyeda et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2016; Khanh et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2019) . The isolate I0305/19 can replicate J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f efficiently in both the trachea and lungs in the infected SPF chickens, which was demonstrated by viral titration in SPF chicken eggs and viral antigen detection by IHC. A previous study also showed that some of the nephropathogenic IBV strains are less pathogenic for tracheal tissues (Fernando et al., 2013; despite the epithelium of the trachea being the initial and principal site of viral replication (Ignjatovi\u0107and and Sapats, 2000) . Indeed, the isolate I0305/19 was a nephropathogenic strain, as shown by nephritis of the infected chickens, viral titration in kidneys using chicken eggs, and results of IHC of the kidneys. Pathogenicity of IBV strains for the oviduct of layers varies greatly. Several IBV GI-19 strains can replicate in the epithelial cells of the oviduct, thereby causing pathological changes (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972; Benyeda et al., 2009; de Wit et al., 2011; Khanh et al., 2018) . In the present study, only four birds survived in the challenge test and two of them were layers. Both the layers showed no gross oviduct lesions at 30 dpi when compared with the control birds. Because of the small number of layers in the present study, it remains unclear whether the isolate I0305/19 can induce pathogenic changes in the oviducts. Further investigation using a defined group of female chickens is needed to confirm this observation. In addition, virus was also detected at high titration in the bursa of Fabricius, cecal tonsils, and gastrointestinal tissues, and at low titration in the spleen and liver at 4 dpi; the rapid replication and broader tissue tropism of the virus during the early stage of infection are important factors to consider that this isolate is highly pathogenic to chickens.",

            "text": "In the present study, the isolate I0305/19 was proven to originate from at least J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f four recombination events between LJS/120848-and 4/91-like strains in which the S gene sequences were found to be similar to that of the LJS/120848-like strain clustered in the GI-19 lineage (Valastro et al., 2010) . Binding to host tissues is the first step in the viral life cycle of IBV and is therefore critical in determining tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Tissue tropism differs depending on the amino acid composition of the S1 protein (Casais et al., 2003; Promkuntod et al., 2014; Leyson et al., 2016; Parsons et al., 2019) ; therefore, S1 is considered to be responsible for host receptor binding (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . It was demonstrated that the RBD of GI-19 virus binding to the trachea and kidney is dependent on a different sialylated glycan ligand compared to M41-RBD (Promkuntod et al., 2014) ; furthermore, three amino acids (KIP at positions 110-112) have been identified in an GI-19 lineage strain CK/SWE/0658946/10 that enable binding to the kidney of infected chickens (Bouwman et al., 2019) . Interestingly, we found that isolate I0305/19 and other viruses isolated in China have the amino acid sequence MIA at positions 110 -112 in the S protein. It is unknown whether these amino acid changes affected the RBD of the S1 protein of these IBV isolates, in particular for interaction with alpha-2,3-sialic acid or other putative IBV receptors on the surface of the host cells. However, we found that Chinese GI-19 viruses with different tissue tropism and pathogenicity shared the same RBD-MIA. Thus, mutations in this region, even in the S1 protein, of these IBV isolates did not seem to be the only factor responsible for viral tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Coincidentally, a previous study also indicated that genetic alterations in the S1 gene of IBV strains could not change their tissue tropism and Coronaviruses including IBV have been shown to exist in biological samples as a group of closely related subpopulations (quasi-species) that are generated through mutations and recombination events that occur when the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which lacks proofreading capabilities, replicates the viral genome (McKinley et al., 2011) . The genetic changes allow rapid adaption to the host by selection of more fit viral subpopulation(s); this, however, can possibly lead to changes in pathogenesis and emergence of new pathogens. In the present study, we sequenced the S1 gene from nine tissues of isolate I0305/19-infected chickens by the Sanger method, because it was reported that most genetic changes occur in the S1 gene during adaption and infection in the host (Cavanagh et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007) . We sequenced the RT-PCR products because that data represented all the possible genetic diversities within the population of viruses in a given tissue sample. Our data showed differences in S1 sequences between the challenge I0305/19 virus and the virus from tissues of some infected chickens; this was most likely due to the induction of mutations through replication of the genome.",

More studies based on the reverse genetic techniques are needed to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the altered tissue tropism and pathogenicity of the isolate I0305/19. The introduction and establishment of low virulent virus, such as vaccination with the vaccine strain, could provide, at least in part, protection against and competition with other invading viruses in a flock. This introduction could hamper the occurrence of disease outbreaks caused by other invading viruses; however, it could also facilitate the occurrence of infection by highly virulent strains that were not well matched with the established viruses. This may be the case for the introduction of the isolate I0305/19 in the diseased chicken flock; the isolate caused high mortality in the vaccinated chickens. The high poultry farm density and high chicken concentrations in a farm, as commonly observed in Chinese poultry, surely create favorable conditions for viral replication, maintenance, and circulation of such viral infection, thus resulting in the emergence of novel viruses and genesis of viral population. Therefore, in addition to the regular vaccination, improved management and biosecurity practices may help to reduce viral emergence and control the disease outbreaks. Presently, little information is available on the population dynamics of the isolate I0305/19-like viruses in China. Surveillance based on properly planned sampling in different regions may be needed for better understanding the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f epidemiology and evolution of the isolate.",

The results also demonstrated that GI-19 strains isolated in European countries clustered together, although viruses isolated in one European country showed closer relationship than those in other countries.
