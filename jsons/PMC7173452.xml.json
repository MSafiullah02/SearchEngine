Host defence mechanisms, including those associated with the ciliated epithelium in the nose and sinuses, lysozyme in saliva and IgA and other immunoglobulins in mucous secretions or serum, may help to reduce the incidence of infections due to respiratory pathogens (p. 205, Section on immune deficiency, in Chapter 8 and also oral candidiasis in Chapter 21). The normal mouth flora probably contributes to the prevention of attachment of exogenous pathogens to the mucosa. Nevertheless, certain \u2018respiratory pathogens\u2019 are sometimes carried asymptomatically in the mouth or nose of healthy individuals (Table 11.1(2)). The administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics may greatly disturb the normal flora and predispose to colonization by organisms which are not normally evident in the mouth (Table 11.1(1)); ultimately this might result in superinfections, such as thrush (see\np. 270).",

An average pre-school child is said to have about six upper respiratory tract infections a year. Most of the infections are of viral aetiology and occur in winter. Bacterial infections are also very common in young children. The relationship between age and infections due to viruses, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, capsulated Pittman type b strains, Bordetella pertussis and other organisms affecting the upper respiratory tract are mainly discussed in Chapters 8 and 10. The eustachian tubes in infants are relatively wider and more horizontal than in adults; this might partly explain the greater incidence of acute otitis media in infants since the causative organisms may spread directly from the throat to the middle ear via the eustachian tube. Older children and adults usually have good immunity to a wide range of respiratory pathogens but the \u2018common cold\u2019 continues to be prevalent in these age groups.

If no beta-haemolytic streptococci are isolated after overnight incubation of the culture plate, viruses are the probable cause of the sore throat. However, if a bacitracin-sensitive beta-haemolytic streptococcus is isolated, it is likely that the sore throat is due to Strep. pyogenes (but see\np. 17). Recently tests have been developed to detect Strep. pyogenes antigen in throat swabs, which allows rapid diagnosis, but they are not yet reliable enough to be recommended routinely. Cultures are also preferable because antibiotic sensitivity tests and typing investigations on isolates can be carried out. Cultures for C. diphtheriae are essential when diphtheria is clinically suspected (see\np. 199 and Chapter 1). C. haemolyticum should be looked for, especially in patients with a sore throat and a scarlet fever-type rash, and antibiotic sensitivity tests carried out if this organism is isolated because some strains are more sensitive to erythromycin than penicillin.",
