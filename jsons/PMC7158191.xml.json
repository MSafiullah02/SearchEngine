The taxonomic groups in the family Mustelidae, as recognized by Corbet and Hill (1980), include 67 species from North, Central, and South America, Eurasia, and Africa. No other carnivore shows such diversity of adaptation, being found in a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from arctic tundra to tropical rain forests. Mustelids have retained many primitive characteristics, which include relatively small size, short stocky legs, five toes per foot, elongated braincase, and short rostrum (Anderson, 1989). The Mustelinae is the central subfamily of the Mustelidae. The best-known members of the Mustelinae are the weasels, mink, and ferrets (genus Mustela) and the martens (genus Martes) (Anderson, 1989). The genus Mustela is divided into five subgenera: Mustela (weasels), Lutreola (European mink), Vison (American mink), Putorius (ferrets), and Grammogale (South American weasels).",

Earlier references to ferrets are probably the basis of the belief that ferrets originated in North Africa (Thomson, 1951). Evidently they were bred specifically for rabbiting (rabbit hunting) and were muzzled before being sent into rabbit burrows. This practice was later introduced into Europe, Asia, and the British Isles, where the sport is still practiced today.",

Alternatively, it may be related to the steppe polecat (M. eversmanni), which it closely resembles in skull morphology (Walton, 1977).

Early studies utilized the ferret in classic experiments with influenza virus pathogenesis (Pyle, 1940). Its use was cited infrequently; an article published in 1940, detailing the use of ferrets in research, cited only 26 publications (Pyle, 1940). Literature reviews undertaken in 1967, 1969, 1973, and 1985, however, revealed an increasing appreciation for the ferret's usefulness and versatility in the study of human physiologic, anatomic, and disease mechanisms (Hahn and Wester, 1969; Marshall and Marshall, 1973; Shump et al., 1974; Frederick and Babish, 1985). In 1991, a bibliography containing \u201cselected\u201d literature citations on the ferret and its use in biomedical research was published (Clingerman et al., 1991). The document was designed to serve as a reference tool for individuals involved in the care or use of ferrets in the laboratory setting. Although not comprehensive, the document provides extensive coverage of ferret biology, diseases, and use as an animal model. The domesticated ferret has been and continues to be used extensively in studies involving virology, reproductive physiology, anatomy, and endocrinology, as well as other areas of biomedical research (Morgan and Travers, 1998). The ferret is also being used to replace the cat in some types of neuroendocrinology, neuroanatomy, and cardiology experiments.",

For example, commercial farms have been raising ferrets for almost 50 years. Biomedical researchers in the United States can request animals of a specific sex, weight, and age for individual experiments. Investigators in other countries may acquire ferrets from fur operations or may make arrangements with commercial vendors in the United States. Even though the ferret is nonstandardized with regard to exact genotype and pedigree, its routine availability in a clinically healthy state has aided immeasurably its acceptance as a research animal. Readily available commercial stocks, based on coat color, are albino, sable (or fitch), Siamese, silver mitt, and Siamese-silver mitt (Siamese with white chest and feet) (McLain et al., 1985). The fitch or so-called wild coat color is the most common, recognized by yellow-buff fur with patches of black or dark brown, particularly on the tail and limbs (Andrews and Illman, 1987). The production of ferrets by large commercial operations has raised concern by some that inbreeding of these animals has made the ferret more susceptible to diseases, e.g., endocrine-related disorders.",

The tracheal size and laryngeal anatomy make endotracheal intubation somewhat challenging, and as a result the ferret has been advocated as a species suitable for use in pediatric intubation training (Powell et al., 1991). The lungs are relatively large, and the total lung capacity is nearly 3 times that which would be predicted based on body size, as compared with other mammals. This characteristic, together with a higher degree of bronchiolar branching and more extensive bronchial submucosal glands (as compared with the dog), makes the ferret an attractive model for pulmonary research studies (Vinegar et al., 1985). Although a previous report (Willis and Barrow, 1971) commented that the carotid arterial branching pattern in the ferret is unusual, it is actually typical for a carnivore. As is the case in the dog and the cat, the paired common carotid arteries arise from the brachiocephalic trunk (sometimes called the innominate artery) at the level of the thoracic inlet (Andrews et al., 1979b).",

Ferrets, especially intact males and estrous jills, may possess a distinctive musky odor even after a successful descenting, because of normal sebaceous secretions. Ferrets lack well-developed sweat glands for use in thermal regulation, and as a result they are predisposed to heat prostration when ambient temperatures reach 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0 F) (Ry-landeia et al., 1983).",

Diets that are high in fish products are also not recommended for ferrets (Fox and McLain, 1998).

Daily maintenance energy consumption for ferrets is 200\u2013300 kcal/kg body weight. Calorie-percent protein ratios have been determined for mink (Mustela vison) kits up to and after 16 weeks of age (Sinclair et al., 1962; Allen et al., 1964). A ratio of 13 and a caloric density of 550 kcal/100 gm of feed, corresponding to 42% protein, provided optimum growth for male kits up to 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, ratios of 17 and 21, corresponding to 36% and 26% protein, respectively, were recommended.

Ferrets, like humans, convert \u03b2-carotene to vitamin A in the gut and absorb \u03b2-carotene intact (Fox and McLain, 1998). In intestinal perfusion experiments in ferrets, it was demonstrated that \u03b2-carotene, retinol, and retinyl esters are absorbed intact into lymph and that cleavage products, including \u03b2-apo-12\u2032-carotenal, \u03b2-apo-10\u2032-carotenal, and retinoids, accumulate in the intestinal mucosa (Wang et al., 1992). The intestinal mucosa is capable of converting \u03b2-carotene into retinoic acid and other polar metabolites, which are then transported via the portal vein to the liver (Wang et al., 1993). \u03b2-Carotene absorption is enhanced by co-perfusion with \u03b1-tocopherol, and the perfusion of the latter is unaltered by the presence of \u03b2-carotene. The conversion of \u03b2-carotene into retinol is also enhanced by the presence of \u03b1-tocopherol (Wang et al., 1995). These and other findings have established the ferret as an important model for the study of these antioxidants.",

            "text": "Features of ferret reproduction may be found in Table VI\n. Female ferrets are seasonal breeders and induced ovulators. The season under natural illumination in the Northern Hemisphere is from March to August for females and from December to July for males, corresponding temporally to increasing day length. Ferrets born in the late spring or early summer and maintained under natural lighting will not assume an adult pattern of gonadal activity (i.e., puberty) until the following season (Baum, 1998). Under artificial illumination, jills that are maintained at 8 hr light-16 hr dark reach puberty at 10\u201312 months. Stimulatory photoperiods may be used, however, in the laboratory or intensive production setting, as a method of breeding ferrets out of the natural season. However, the transfer from short to long photoperiods should not occur prior to 90 days of age, because jills that are prematurely transferred will remain anestrous (Hammond and Chesterman, 1972). Management practices in one breeding facility are such that jills commence breeding at 7\u201310 months, average 3.7 litters a year, and are cycled out of reproduction after 6 litters. In another strategy, ferrets are exposed to a 16:8 hr photoperiod at 12 weeks of age, are bred at 16 weeks during their first estrus, and whelp at 5\u00bd months. Vulvar swelling is the hallmark of estrus in jills. The ease with which estrus is detected in the ferret, as well as the size of the ferret and ease of its maintenance in captivity have made the ferret a model for study of neuroendocrine events and their gonadal correlates. Along with the hamster, the ferret has contributed extensively to an understanding of the photoperiodic influences on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (Baum, 1998). As in females of other species, estradiol concentrations are responsible for controlling the development of the female reproductive tract and secondary sexual characteristics, and the tonic inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by the anterior pituitary during both prepubertal life and anestrus. The sensitivity of the hypothalamic gonadostat to negative feedback inhibition by estradiol changes at the time of puberty, and under the influence of increasing light exposure, LH levels rise despite estradiol (Ryan, 1984). Similarly, age differences in the sensitivity of negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by testosterone, or to estrogenic compounds derived from the aromatization of testosterone, appear to be essential in determining puberty and seasonality of reproduction in the male (Baum, 1998).",

Changes in vaginal cytology have also been described for the ferret and other mustelid species, but these changes are seldom used to determine onset of estrus or to schedule breeding (Williams et al., 1992). After a 2- to 3-week proestrus, estrus occurs. Estrus onset is not associated with elevated serum FSH in the ferret, as it is in the rodent. Once estrus has occurred, it may terminate in coitus-induced ovulation and pregnancy, pseudopregnancy after infertile mating, pharmacologic termination (by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or GnRH), death due to estrogen-induced aplastic anemia, or spontaneous remission and anestrus due to reduced photoperiod. Waves of follicular development occur in estrus, and 5\u201313 ova are ovulated approximately 30\u201340 hr after coitus. Female ferrets are brought to the male approximately 14 days after vulvar enlargement. Females and males copulate many times and for prolonged periods of time; they are typically left together for 2 days. Both intromission and neck restraint by the male are apparently required for induction of ovulation (Baum, 1998). An LH surge accompanies coitus in females, but the same is not true of males (Carroll et al., 1987). Implantation occurs 12 days after mating; both a functional corpus luteum and the anterior pituitary are required for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. Placentation is typical of carnivores and is zonary and endotheliochorial (Morrow, 1980). Pregnancy may be detected by ultrasonographic demonstration of 3\u20135 discrete nonechogenic structures as early as day 12 (Peter et al., 1990), by palpation as early as day 14, or by radiographic demonstration of calcified fetal skeletons at approximately 30 days of gestation.",

Kits remaining in utero beyond the 43rd day typically die; kits with congenital malformations such as cyclopia and exencephaly may also delay the initiation of labor. Dystocia is common in ferrets because of positional abnormalities and fetal oversize and should be treated by cesarean section. Jills tolerate cesareans well and will nurse kits delivered in this way.

In the laboratory setting, when jills are maintained in a nonstimulatory photoperiod (8 hr light\u201416 hr dark) for 6\u20138 weeks, followed by reversal of the cycle (16 hr light-8 hr dark), estrus will follow in 4 weeks (immature jills) or 3 weeks (mature jills) after the change (Carroll et al., 1985).

The exact cause of these conditions is uncertain, but predisposing factors such as overeating, sudden changes in diet, the proliferation of C. perfringens type A, and the production of overwhelming amounts of toxins are suspected (Field and Laboratory Service Veterinary Staff, 1984; Schulman et al., 1993).

According to the author, reasons for therapeutic failure included dose selection, interspecies differences in pharmacokinetics and possible reinfection. Supportive care should be instituted, and choice of antibiotic therapy in confirmed diarrheic cases should be based on culture and sensitivity. In addition, because of its zoonotic potential, isolation of affected animals and good hygienic practices are recommended. Reculture of animals after treatment to ensure elimination of the organism is recommended.",

In humans, epidemiologic data strongly support the association between H. pylori and development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Similarly, we have recently documented a series of H. mustelae\u2013infected ferrets with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma that parallels the same syndrome found in humans. Lymphoma was diagnosed in the wall of the lesser curvature of the pyloric antrum, corresponding to the predominant focus of H. mustelae\u2013induced gastritis in ferrets. Gastric lymphomas demonstrated characteristic lymphoepithelial lesions, and the lymphoid cells were IgG positive in all ferrets (Erdman et al., 1997). These findings and their parallels in H. pylori-infected humans implicate the involvement of H. mustelae in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer in ferrets.",

Enrofloxacin (2.5 mg/kg BID PO after a loading dose of 5.0 mg/kg IM) is often effective. Jills may require aggressive care, because acute mastitis may progress rapidly and animals may become septicemic and moribund (Liberson et al., 1983). Oral antibiotic administration to kits nursing affected jills is recommended (Bell, 1997a). Surgical resection and debridement of affected glands and supportive care may be necessary for jills with acute mastitis. Supplementation of kits with milk replacer may also be necessary, because jills with acute mastitis are reluctant to nurse, and jills with the chronic form have diminished lactation as milk-producing tissue is replaced by scar tissue (Bell, 1997a). Maintaining thorough personal hygiene practices when handling affected jills is important in minimizing spread to other lactating jills. Cross-fostering kits may be required; however, kits may spread infection to healthy jills. It is reported that jills with the chronic form of mastitis should be culled (Bell, 1997a).",

At least 75% of jills carrying more than 8 kits will develop pregnancy toxemia if subjected to 24 hr of food withdrawal in late gestation (Bell, 1997a; Batchelder et al., 1999). Any jill with 15 or more kits may develop pregnancy toxemia because abdominal space is not adequate for both the gravid uterus and the volume of food required to support it. Pregnancy toxemia of the ferret is of the metabolic type and shares features with similar conditions in pregnant sheep, obese cattle, pregnant camelids, obese guinea pigs, and starved pregnant rats, as well as with the condition feline idiopathic hepatic lipidosis. It is characterized by abnormal energy metabolism with consequent hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, ketosis, and hepatic lipidosis. In this condition, energy demand exceeds intake, leading to excessive mobilization of free fatty acids and a chain of metabolic events that culminates in a shift from fatty acid metabolism and export to ketosis and hepatic lipidosis. Clinical signs include anorexia, lethargy, melena, dehydration, and easily epilated hair. Differentials include dystocia, metritis, pyometra, septicemia, renal failure, and Helicobacter mustelae-induced gastric ulcer. In a recent study of ferrets with pregnancy toxemia, consistent clinical chemistry abnormalities included azotemia (100%), hypocalcemia (83%), hypoproteinemia (70%), and elevated liver enzymes (100%) (Batchelder et al., 1999). Anemia was found in 50% of ferrets tested. Necropsy findings include tan or yellow discolored liver, gastric hemorrhage, and gravid uterus. Treatment for jills within a day of their due date should include cesarean section and intensive postoperative support, including force-feeding a gruel of high-quality cat food and ferret chow, nutritive pastes, intravenous fluids containing glucose, and supplemental heat. Cesarean section should be performed under isoflurane anesthesia because hepatic dysfunction prolongs the metabolism of injectable agents. Agalactia is common after cesarean section, and kits may require hand feeding with kitten or puppy milk replacers, administered per os by fine-tipped syringe 6 times daily for the first 24 hr. Cross fostering is an effective method of enhancing kit survival; hand rearing of kits if the jill fails to nurse within a day postoperatively is energy-consuming and generally unrewarding. For jills that develop pregnancy toxemia before day 40 of gestation, fluids and nutritional support must be provided until viable kits can be delivered by cesarean.",

Jills that remain in estrus for more than 1 month are at risk for developing estrogen-induced anemia. Hyperestrogenism from persistent estrus causes bone marrow hypoplasia of all cell lines in approximately half of ferrets in prolonged estrus (Ryland et al., 1983). Clinical signs include vulvar enlargement, bilaterally symmetric alopecia of the tail and abdomen, weakness, anorexia, depression, lethargy, weight loss, bacterial infection, and mucopurulent vaginal discharge. Hematology findings may vary from an initial neutrophilia and thrombocytosis early in the disease course to lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. The anemia begins as normocytic normochromic but progresses to macrocytic hypochromic (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985). Coagulopathy associated with hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia combine to produce extensive manifestations of bleeding, pallor, melena, petechiation or ecchymosis, subdural hematoma, and hematomyelia (Hart, 1985; Fox and Bell, 1998). At necropsy, tissue pallor, light tan to pale pink bone marrow, hemorrhage, bronchopneumonia, hydrometra, pyometra, and mucopurulent vaginitis may be seen. Histopathology may reveal cystic endometrial hypoplasia, hemosiderosis, diminished splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and mild to moderate hepatic lipidosis (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985; Bell, 1997a). Treatment consists of terminating estrus while supporting the animal with antibiotics, blood transfusion, B vitamins, and nutritional supplementation. Estrus may be terminated by injection with 50\u2013100 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 20 \u03bcg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), repeated 1 week after initial injection if required. Ovariohysterectomy may be considered for ferrets that are stable and have adequate numbers of platelets and red cells. Ferrets with a packed cell volume (PCV) of 25% or greater have a good prognosis and require only termination of estrus for resolution of aplastic anemia. Jills with a PCV of 15\u201325% may require blood transfusions and have a guarded prognosis. Ferrets with a PCV of less than 15% have a poor prognosis and require aggressive therapy with multiple transfusions. The lack of identifiable blood groups in ferrets makes multiple transfusions uncomplicated by potential transfusion reactions (Manning and Bell, 1990b).",

Exacerbation of signs may be achieved by challenging young ferrets with influenza virus and aspirin (Desmukh et al., 1985) and constitutes a model of Reye's syndrome in children. Lethargy and aggressiveness yield to prostration, coma, and death in affected ferrets. Hyperammonemia presumably occurs because of the inability of ferrets to produce adequate amounts of ornithine from non-arginine precursors. Detoxification of ammonia is thereby compromised. Ferrets more than 18 months old are unaffected by arginine-free diets.",

Entangled kits may succumb to dehydration, hypothermia, and hypoglycemia because they are unable to nurse and the jill cannot curl around them. Detailed dissection with fine scissors and forceps under a heat lamp or on a heated surface can free the kits. Occasionally, kits may need to be rotated on their umbilical pedicle to achieve adequate clearance to cut the cord; cords should be cut as far from the umbilicus as possible. The use of warm saline or water may help soften the mass. Some kits in the tangle may present with dark, swollen extremities or prolapsed umbilical cords and may require euthanasia.

Disease may be evident in ferrets as young as 2 years old, but later onset (at 4\u20135 years of age) is typical (Caplan et al., 1996; Ehrhart et al., 1996). Nonspecific presenting signs include weight loss, vomiting, and ataxia. Weakness is often evident, ranging from lethargy to posterior paresis or outright collapse (Caplan et al., 1996). Hypoglycemia caused by excess production of insulin by neoplastic \u03b2 cells may cause tremors, disorientation, or seizures (Fox and Marini, 1998). Excessive salivation (ptyalism) or pawing at the mouth is a frequent finding. Clinical signs are often intermittent or episodic. Other common findings include splenomegaly and lymphocytosis. Presumptive diagnosis is made based on clinical signs in conjunction with the demonstration of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose determinations for the diagnosis of insulinoma are most useful when taken after a 4 hr fasting period. Fasting glucose concentrations below 60 may be diagnostic for the condition (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997), whereas values between 60 and 85 are suspect and the test should be repeated (Fox and Marini, 1998). Other potential causes for hypoglycemia should be ruled out, including anorexia, starvation, hepatic disease, sepsis, and nonpancreatic neoplasia (Antinoff, 1997). Demonstration of concurrent hyperinsulinemia aids the diagnosis (Caplan et al., 1996). Medical management using prednisone and/or diazoxide along with dietary modification such as frequent feeding of high-protein meals can minimize or control clinical signs but will not affect the underlying tumor (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997). Surgical exploration of the pancreas and tumor excision are recommended for animals that are healthy enough to be subjected to anesthesia and surgery. Histological examination of the tissue removed can provide a definitive diagnosis, and although the effect may be transient, clinical signs are often reduced or eliminated after surgical debulking (Figs. 7\nand 8\n) (Ehrhart et al., 1996). Histologically, these tumors reveal malignant proliferation of pancreatic \u03b2 cells, and local recurrence or metastasis to lymph nodes, mesentery, spleen, or liver may occur (Caplan et al., 1996).",

If clinical signs are present, they often include weight loss and a bilateral, symmetric alopecia. Pruritus is a variable finding (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997). Although ferrets with this syndrome have been called \u201ccushingoid,\u201d it is rare to diagnose elevated resting levels of glucocorticoids or an abnormal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation or dexamethasone suppression testing. Elevation of adrenal sex hormones (e.g., androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and/or estradiol) is more likely, and these may lead to characteristic changes such as estruslike vulvar swelling in spayed females and prostatic changes in males (Rosenthal and Peterson, 1996; Coleman et al., 1998). Rule-outs for enlarged vulva include estrus in an intact female or functional ovarian remnants in a spayed female. Abdominal palpation may reveal cranial abdominal masses, and ultrasound may be useful (Barthez et al., 1998). Serum assay for abnormal levels of the sex hormones listed above should be considered (Lipman et al., 1993; Wagner and Dorn, 1994; Rosenthal and Peterson, 1996).",

In each of these 5 ferrets, near total alopecia resolved within a few months of being housed in a research environment. Despite being asymptomatic at the end of the study, all 5 were shown to have histologic evidence of adrenocortical neoplasia. Although this phenomenon is mediated by hormonal effects, anecdotal reports such as this suggest that the alopecia may be significantly modulated by environmental factors (e.g., photoperiod or diet).",

The early age of onset in some ferrets and reports of case clustering have led to investigation into potential infectious etiologies for lymphoma in the ferret (Erdman et al., 1996b). Earlier reports of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) seroconversion in affected animals have not been substantiated. However, experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that a retrovirus that is distinct from FeLV may be involved (Erdman et al., 1995). In one study, whole or filtered lymphoma cells from a 3-year-old ferret with spontaneous lymphoma were injected IP into 6 recipient ferrets (Erdman et al., 1995). Two of the 6 ferrets were euthanized after 14 months, but the remaining 4 developed splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and lymphoma. One ferret that received cell-free materials developed multicentric lymphoma with prominent cutaneous lymphoma nodules. Elevated reverse transcriptase activity and retrovirus-like particles evident by electron microscopy were seen in the donor and all of the affected recipient ferrets.",

Affected animals commonly present with lethargy, weight loss, and anorexia. Physical examination may reveal signs of congestive heart failure such as hypothermia, tachycardia, cyanosis, jugular distension, and respiratory distress (Lipman et al., 1987). Auscultation may reveal a heart murmur and/or muffled cardiac sounds. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are often identified. Radiographs may reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette and evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion (Greenlee and Stephens, 1984). Electrocardiography and echocardiography can help make the definitive diagnosis. Medical therapy (supportive care, diuretics, and inotropic drugs) may relieve clinical signs and improve the quality of life for a period of months (Stamoulis et al., 1997). The long-term prognosis for survival is guarded to poor.",

In many cases the enlarged spleen appears to be a secondary manifestation of another disease (e.g., insulinoma, cardiomyopathy, or adrenal tumor) and is of unknown significance (Stamoulis et al., 1997). Histologic examination of affected organs has revealed that the most common cause for splenic enlargement (in the absence of a neoplastic infiltrate) is extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) (Erdman et al., 1998). This may be an incidental finding, but it has been suggested that in some cases a pathologically enlarged spleen may play a role in chronic anemia that may respond to splenectomy, a syndrome known as hypersplenism (Ferguson, 1985). Splenomegaly can also be commonly found in conjunction with lymphoma, with or without intrasplenic neoplastic lymphoid accumulations. In anesthetized ferrets, splenomegaly may be caused by splenic sequestration of erythrocytes (Marini et al., 1994, 1997). Because this is a transient effect, the normalization of splenic size upon recovery from anesthesia can help in the differentiation of anesthetic-induced splenomegaly from that due to other causes.",

Presenting signs for this syndrome generally include chronic weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and occasionally vomiting. Eosinophilic granulomas have been found in the mesenteric lymph nodes of most affected ferrets, and in some cases other organs (e.g., lung or liver) may be involved. An interesting finding in many ferrets is the presence of Splendore\u2013Hoeppli material in the inflamed lymph nodes, a histological phenomenon that has been associated in other species with helminths, bacteria, fungi, and foreign bodies (Fig. 12\n). An etiological agent has not been identified; consequently, therapy consists largely of supportive care to treat the chronic enteritis (Fox, 1998b). Based on the biology of eosinophils, however, the use of corticosteroids or ivermectin has been attempted and may be beneficial (Bell, 1997b).",
