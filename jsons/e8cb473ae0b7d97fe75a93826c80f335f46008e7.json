Mycobacterial entry and intracellular survival in monocytes were assessed with and without anti-CD13 antibody (WM15 and WM47) using flow cytometry and colony formation assay. Results: By using magnetic nanoparticles and confocal microscopy, M. tuberculosis was found to be capable of binding to either soluble CD13 or membranous CD13 on monocytes. Flow cytometry showed that pretreatment of monocytes with WM15 or WM47 reduced the number of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Collectively, the data suggest that CD13 is a binding and entry receptor for M. tuberculosis on monocytes. Treatment of infected monocytes showed a greater effect of WM47 than WM15 in reducing the intracellular colonization of M. tuberculosis, suggesting that specific epitopes of CD13 may play an important role modulating intracellular M. tuberculosis survival.",

            "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most successful pathogens estimated to have infected nearly one-third of the human population and killing approximately 1.7 million people each year. 1 Much of its success is due to essential virulence factors that allow it to survive within phagocytes rather than to be eliminated by these scavenger cells. Mycobacteria bind to macrophages in cholesterol and lipid-rich domains of the host cell plasma membrane called lipid rafts, 2 which are associated with various signalling mechanisms. 3 Once within the cell, the organism can degrade cholesterol as energy source to maintain a chronic infection in the host. 4 Additionally, mycobacterial interference with lipid-mediated signalling arrests phagosome maturation, thus protecting the bacterium against delivery to the lysosome. 5 Aminopeptidase N (CD13) is a multifunctional protein expressed in many tissues and has been found to be partially localized in lipid rafts. 3 It influences plasma membrane protein organization 6 and cholesterol uptake. 7 It can exist both as a membranebound protein and as an active soluble protein secreted by certain cells or released by cleavage of the plasma membrane. 8 CD13 has been shown to be a cell-surface receptor for certain viruses, seemingly required for endocytosis enabling internalization of the virus into the cell. 9 ,10 By a modified isotope-coded affinity tag technology, 11 we previously found a significantly elevated expression of CD13 in human phagocytes infected with M. tuberculosis (Lu & Tsai, unpubl. data, 2007) . We therefore speculated that CD13 might have a yet undefined role in mycobacterial infection. This study was designed to assess the interaction between CD13 and M. tuberculosis, investigating both entry of the organism into monocytes and its subsequent intracellular survival.",

The binding of soluble CD13 to M. tuberculosis was detected by staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD13 antibody and an isotype antibody as negative control. As demonstrated by the flow cytometry, a dose-dependent increase of CD13-positive M. tuberculosis organisms was observed with the binding of CD13 to M. tuberculosis reaching up to 6.53% (Fig. 1a,b ). An irrelevant protein CD4 was concurrently utilized to test whether the binding of M. tuber-culosis was specific for CD13. No apparent binding was observed between CD4 (0.5 \u03bcg) and M. tuberculosis (Fig. 1a, bottom row) . CD13-MNP was also prepared to evaluate the binding affinity between CD13 and M. tuberculosis. While applying an external magnetic field to accelerate the process of aggregation, we noticed that CD13-MNP aggregates were lightly coloured in comparison with those of MNP (Fig. 1c) . We speculated that abundant M. tuberculosis organisms bound to CD13-MNP shuttered the natural brown colour of MNP. To estimate the amount of unbound M. tuberculosis in the solution, we removed the aggregate pellets by applying an external magnetic field and estimated the density of mycobacteria in the solution by measuring absorbance at 600 nm (Fig. 1d) . Prior to the addition of MNP, mycobacterial concentration was 3.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10 7 /mL. At 10 min after mixing, much less unbound M. tuberculosis (0.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10 7 /mL) was detected in the CD13-MNP solution than in the MNP solution (2.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7 10 7 / mL). Following acid-fast staining, the majority of plain nanoparticle aggregates were found to be small, with only occasional acid-fast organisms seen (Fig. 1e) . By contrast, CD13-MNP aggregates occurred in large clusters surrounded by and intermingled with abundant acid-fast organisms. These results indicate that soluble CD13 binds M. tuberculosis.",

Both decrease CD13 expression, but WM15 also inhibits the aminopeptidase activity. 13, 14 To explore whether mycobacterial internalization was mediated through CD13, monocytes pretreated with WM15 and WM47 were then incubated with M. tuberculosis for 24 h. Our results show that the ratio of M. tuberculosis-positive monocytes was significantly reduced by the treatment of 10 \u03bcg/mL WM15 (72.1 \u00b1 4.9%, P = 0.0046) or 10 \u03bcg/mL WM47 (66.2 \u00b1 5.3%, P = 0.003) as compared with that of isotype control (Fig. 3) . As with monocytes, anti-CD13 antibody also reduces the entry of mycobateria into macrophages (Appendix S3 in the online supporting information). Such data support that CD13 is one of the entry receptors on monocytes and macrophages for M. tuberculosis.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that the receptors involved in phagocytic entry of the bacilli have a major influence on the pathogens' intracellular survival. 24 For example, complement receptor 3-mediated phagocytosis does not result in the same degree of inflammatory response associated with the invasion of macrophages by M. leprae. 25 Internalization of M. tuberculosis via the mannose receptor generates a negative signal delivered through the mannose receptor 26 and inhibits the phagosome-lysosome fusion. 27 The use of these entry points therefore apparently confers a survival benefit. Nevertheless, Zimmerli et al. found that blocking these two particular receptors with specific antibody did not alter the survival and growth of M. tuberculosis in human macrophages. 22 Our Monocytes were infected with M. tuberculosis for 1 h and then post-treated with isotype, or WM15 or WM47 for 24 h. The lysates were cultured for M. tuberculosis on 7H11 agar for 3 weeks, after which colony forming units (CFU) were counted. Bars represented the CFU numbers as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (n = 13). The mean CFU of M. tuberculosis with WM47 (2635 \u00b1 430, P = 0.0002) as well as WM15 (3248 \u00b1 322, P = 0.049) treatment were significantly less than that with isotype control (3827 \u00b1 483). data showed a somewhat different outcome because treatment with two dissimilar anti-CD13 antibodies affected not only the internalization but also intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis in monocytes, particularly the WM47 antibody. This implies that WM47-specific epitope on CD13 may be responsible for reducing intracellular M. tuberculosis survival. It has been shown that cross-linking CD13 with a defined clone of anti-CD13 antibodies induces cell activation, including mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, calcium-fluxing and homotypic aggregation of monocytes in an epitopedependent way. [28] [29] [30] It seems likely that a series of interactions provoked by the treatment with anti-CD13 may link to intracellular growth inhibition of M. tuberculosis in monocytes.",
