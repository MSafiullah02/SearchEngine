Samples were processed within 24 hours of collection as follows: twenty percent (v/v) suspensions were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), emulsified on a Vortex mixer, and centrifuged at 1000 xg. for 15 min. The supernatants were then ultracentrifuged at 12,500 xg. for 45 min at 4 OC, the resulting pellets were washed by resuspension in PBS and the ultracentrifugation step was repeated. Pellets from this second run were resuspended in a little distilled water, one drop stained, either with 4 O/o phosphotungstic acid (PTA) pH 6.0, or with uranylacetate p H 4.3, transferred to a 400 mesh pioloform-covered copper-grid and examined in the electron microscope at a screen magnification of 60,000.",

Med., Reihe B, Bd. 25, Heft 2 this has been confirmed by experimental infection of gnotobiotic animals (SNODGRASS et al., 1976) . Our studies have shown that the agent is present in calves in the Federal Republic of Germany. It is likely that rotavirus infections have always been present, though, since they are generally transient and cause low mortality they have hitherto been masked by the potentially more serious bacterial diseases; only with the almost ubiquitous addition of antibiotics to feedstuffs have such viruses come into greater prominence. It should not be assumed, however, that the presence of rotavirus particles in faeces can necessarily be directly correlated with acute enteritis; other types of particle are also frequently observed, including parvo-, paramyxo-and coronaviruses, and it is possible that one or more of these could cause symptoms of enteritis. Until further work on the interrelationships of these different types has been performed the picture will not be entirely clear.",
