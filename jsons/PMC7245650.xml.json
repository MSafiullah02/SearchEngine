Therefore, utilizing a real-time database of electronic medical records, TriNetX, we compared COVID-19 death rates and co-morbidities between individuals with and without IDD, overall and by age group. Our hypotheses were that 1) people with IDD would have higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions associated with higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outcomes, and 2) the COVID-19 case-fatality rate would be higher for individuals with than without IDD individuals with IDD.",

Yet, this consistency in the overall rate conceals important age-related similarities and differences between the two groups. The case-fatality rate among patients age 75 and over was similar for patients with IDD (21.1%) and without IDD (20.7%). However, the COVID-19 case-fatality rate was higher for patients with IDD at younger ages. For patients age 0-17, the case-fatality rate was 1.6% among patients with IDD and <.1% among patients without IDD. For those ages 18-74, the case-fatality rate was 4.5% among patients with IDD and 2.7% among patients without IDD.",

As with the majority of studies that utilize health records to analyze IDD trends, the TriNetX data includes a small number of IDD cases, limiting our ability to further specify age groups. In addition, the TriNetX platform does not represent the general population, but rather represents only those people who seek medical care within the 42 health care organizations in the network. Within the database for this report, there is a much larger representation from the US especially for people with IDD; within the US, more cases are from systems in the Northeast and Midwest. We are also unable to control for any confounding effects which could influence risk for death. To minimize that effect, we did stratify by age. There are always possible inaccuracies within EMR data related to coding or data entry errors. Because of the statistical analyses built into the platform, we were limited in our choice of variables and statistical tests. We were unable to clearly establish deaths documented as being specifically related to COVID-19, and thus we determined death as documentation up to 30 days post diagnosis of COVID-19 to minimize deaths related to other causes, but possibly missing COVID-19 related deaths outside this time frame. In addition, the TriNetX platform does not allow for statistical testing of differences in demographic and co-morbidity characteristics.",

Results from this study also point to distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD. The age-related distribution of COVID-19 cases peaked for both groups at ages 18-74, but was comparatively higher for those with IDD at ages 0-17, and comparatively lower at ages 75 and over. In addition, the age-related distribution of COVID-19 deaths peaked earlier, at ages 18-74, for those with IDD, compared to ages 75 and older for those without IDD. Further emphasizing age related differences, people with IDD had a comparatively higher case-fatality rate than those without IDD at ages 0-17 and 18-74, but a similar case-fatality rate at ages 75 and over. Future work must continue to monitor COVID-19 trends among this and other disability groups with all available data sources, paying particular attention to age related trends when possible.",
