            "text": "RNA recombination was discovered in the early 60s as an exchange of genetic material between closely related RNA viruses which co-infect the same cell [1], [2]. Since then, the formation of recombinant RNAs was observed in infected cells of every kingdom [3]. However, until recently, the molecular mechanism of this process remained an unsolved puzzle. In contrast to DNA recombination, no specific genes were associated with the recombinant formation that precluded dissection of the recombination mechanism by genetic tools; neither could the mechanism be studied biochemically because of the absence of cell-free experimental models. There was no answer even to such basic questions as to whether the recombination is accomplished by viral proteins (e.g. replicase), by host proteins or by RNA molecules themselves. Moreover, since RNA recombination was only observed in vivo, the possibility could not be excluded that the recombining species were not RNAs, but their cDNA copies.",

Recombination may be homologous, if both the parents and the progeny are homologous to each other around the cross-over site, or non-homologous, if it occurs otherwise. While homologous recombination preserves the genome structure, non-homologous recombination changes it. Since most of the viral genome comprises coding sequences or those essential for RNA replication and/or packaging into a virion, it is clear that most of the non-homologous recombinants will not survive. Therefore, experiments of this kind mostly reveal the homologous recombination producing an impression that homologous RNA recombination occurs more frequently than the non-homologous one [3]. As will be seen below, such a view is incorrect.",

It can also be observed by using an engineered virus carrying an insert in a non-essential region. Often, such an insert renders the virus viable but confers onto it a small-plaque phenotype. Occasionally, the insert is deleted by intrastrand recombination, resulting in the restoration of the wild-type phenotype, but the deletions are not necessarily precise [13], [14], [15]. Spontaneous deletions can also occur in wild-type viruses, resulting in the generation of defective interfering (DI) particles [16], [17]. DI particles were first described under the name of \u2018inactive viruses\u2019 as early as in 1943 [18], but only in the 70s was it recognized that these are generated by non-homologous RNA recombination. Since the deletions result in a defect or a lack of at least one of the viral genes, DI particles can only propagate if the same cell is co-infected with the intact authentic virus providing the missing proteins in trans and are detected as particles contaminating the virus preparation. DI particles have been named so due to their ability to interfere with replication of the helper virus [16], [17].",

The frequency of non-homologous recombination was almost never reported, but it can be roughly estimated from the data presented in some papers. In each studied instance, the estimate gives the same value, about 10\u22125/nt, i.e. the same order as the frequency of the most efficient homologous recombination. Surprisingly, non-homologous recombination is equally efficient in picornaviruses [13], [20] manifesting the highest rate of homologous recombination, in RNA phages [15] producing homologous recombinants a million times less frequently and even in alphaviruses [12] in which homologous recombination was not detected at all [9].",

The reported system utilizes the pure replicase of RNA-containing bacteriophage Q\u03b2, a unique RNA-directed RNA polymerase capable to exponentially amplify RNA in vitro [27]. This ability has been employed in the molecular colony technique where single RNA molecules are grown as colonies in an agarose gel containing Q\u03b2 replicase and rNTPs [28].

The reported system [23] used, as recombination substrates, the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-fragments of RQ135\u22121 RNA [30], a 134 nt long Q\u03b2 phage satellite RNA [28] which had arisen by recombination between cellular and viral sequences [30]. The fragments were obtained by breaking the RNA at a natural cross-over site and, to facilitate a replicase switch between the fragments, extending their truncated ends with homologous foreign sequences (Fig. 1). To initiate recombination between the fragments, they were mixed and applied to the replicase-containing agarose. The fragments themselves are not replicable, but recombination between them may produce replicable RNAs resulting in RNA colonies whose number reflects the number of recombinant molecules generated in the system.",

In contrast, only homologous recombinants were formed in a control experiment, in which the same RNA fragments were incubated in the presence of dNTPs and a reverse transcriptase (Fig. 1B), an enzyme capable of switching between templates [31], implying that the mechanism of RNA recombination in the presence of Q\u03b2 replicase is different from template switch. The structure of recombinants suggested that they were generated by an attack of the 3\u2032-terminus of the 5\u2032-fragment at the phosphoester bonds within the 3\u2032-fragment (Fig. 1A). Indeed, the recombination did not occur when the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of the 5\u2032-fragment (but not of the 3\u2032-fragment) was eliminated and returned to the original level upon restoration of the hydroxyl (Fig. 2). In contrast to what is claimed in a recent review [8], these modifications did not introduce any bulky or otherwise unusual to RNA groups which could interfere with replicase binding (cf. Fig. 2). Moreover, the fact that similar modifications of a replicable RNA do not affect its replicability [23], [32] eliminates the possibility [8] that Q\u03b2 replicase requires the terminal 3\u2032-hydroxyl for binding or RNA synthesis. Considered together, these results indicate that RNA recombination in the presence of Q\u03b2 replicase occurs via a transesterification reaction, rather than via a replicative template switch.",

In these experiments, a mixture of the RNA fragments was incubated in a salt buffer and, prior to applying to the Q\u03b2 replicase-containing agarose, it was melted (to destroy any non-covalent complexes) and oxidized with periodate (to prevent further recombination by the above mechanism). Thus, RNA colonies would only grow if recombination had occurred before the oxidation step. It has turned out that RNAs do recombine by themselves. The only requirement is the presence of Mg2+ ions at a millimolar concentration. However, such a self-recombination is entirely different from recombination in the presence of Q\u03b2 replicase. In this case, the fragments recombine by internal segments (Fig. 1C), the 3\u2032-hydroxyls do not participate (Fig. 2) and the reaction is several orders of magnitude slower (Table 1). Moreover, because the chemical step is slow, it becomes rate-limiting and the reaction follows pseudo-first order kinetics. Similar reactions can also occur in cis, resulting in deletions of internal RNA segments [33].",

They crossed the wild-type virus (guanidine sensitive and temperature resistant) with a double mutant (guanidine resistant and temperature sensitive) and looked for a recombinant progeny that was both guanidine and temperature resistant. A peculiarity of their experiment was that viruses infected the cells in two consecutive steps, so that superinfection was performed under conditions inhibiting the replication of the first virus, the duration of the steps being adjusted to ensure equal yields of the parental viruses by the end of the experiment. An unexpected observation was that the yield of recombinants differed more than 100-fold depending on which restrictive factor was applied at superinfection. Specifically, the number of recombinants was high when the cells were superinfected with the wild-type virus at an elevated temperature and low when the cells were superinfected with the mutant virus in the presence of guanidine. According to the authors, such an asymmetric result could not be produced by a breaking and joining mechanism inasmuch as the parental genomes were equally abundant in each case, but was a consequence of asymmetric action of the restrictive factors on RNA synthesis. By referring to unpublished data, they claimed that while an elevated temperature inhibited the synthesis of only the negative strands of the mutant virus, the synthesis of both the negative and positive strands of the wild-type virus was suppressed in the presence of guanidine. Hence, as required by the template switch mechanism, recombination appeared to depend on the ongoing RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "However, these arguments do not seem to be strong enough. Since the negative strands comprise only 2% of the total viral RNA [38] and are presumably involved in double-stranded replicative intermediates [5], recombination by the breaking and joining mechanism may entirely depend on the availability of the positive strands. Yet, the positive strands synthesized at the first step may not be available during superinfection because of their packaging or involvement into polyribosomes. Hence, recombination by this mechanism may depend on whether the positive strands of each parental virus are synthesized during superinfection and will not occur in the presence of guanidine when synthesis of only the mutant positive strands is allowed. In addition, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the observed asymmetry resulted from a direct suppression of recombination by guanidine.",

            "text": "Thus, the template switch mechanism has never been unequivocally demonstrated for RNA recombination. Nevertheless, it may operate in some viruses, such as picorna- and coronaviruses that manifest an unusually high rate of homologous recombination. Switching between templates was directly demonstrated for retroviral reverse transcriptases [31], [39] and for DNA polymerases during PCR [40]. In each of these cases, template switch is possible due to a particular mechanism for dissociating the nascent strand base-paired to its template: the RNA template degradation by the RNAse H activity of reverse transcriptase and the heat-induced melting of DNA duplexes during PCR. Obviously, neither of these means is available for RNA viruses. However, some RNA viruses might have evolved special mechanisms to overcome the duplex problem, e.g. the use of ATP-fueled helicases.",

The question inevitably arises: to what extent are the conclusions made from in vitro data valid for the natural systems [8]? In this regard, recent experiments on recombination between non-replicable and non-translatable fragments of the poliovirus RNA [41] deserve special attention. Upon transfecting appropriate cells, the fragments did produce viable viral genomes, demonstrating that non-replicative recombination can occur in vivo. The results show that, similar to self-recombination, the 3\u2032-hydroxyls do not participate in the reaction and suggest an involvement of the 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate intermediates. The recombination is non-homologous and, importantly, its frequency is similar to the standard frequency of non-homologous RNA recombination in vivo. The results have also revealed recombinational \u2018hot spots\u2019 associated with ribozyme-like RNA structures. Apart from self-recombination, replicase- and ribozyme-assisted recombination, there may exist other non-replicative mechanisms for rearranging the RNA sequences. For example, a mechanism including RNAse-catalyzed cleavage and ligation has been proposed [42].\n",
