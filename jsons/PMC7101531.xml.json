Major histocompatibility complex-restricted donor T cells play an important role in HLA-matched as well as HLA-mismatched HSCT by recognizing differences in minor and major histocompatibility antigens between donor and recipient.1, 2 A novel mechanism that relies on interactions between donor natural killer (NK) cells and recipient cells was demonstrated in the setting of haploidentical family donor HSCT.3, 4, 5 NK cells express on their surface inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) that recognize allotypic determinants (\u2018KIR ligands\u2019) shared by certain HLA class I allele groups. KIR2DL1 recognizes HLA-C alleles with a Lys80 residue (HLA-Cw4 and related, \u2018group 2\u2019 alleles), KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 recognize HLA-C with an Asn80 residue (HLA-Cw3 and related, \u2018group 1\u2019 alleles); KIR3DL1 is the receptor for HLA-B alleles sharing the Bw4 supertypic specificity.3, 4, 5 Finally, KIR3DL2 was shown to function as a receptor for HLA-A3/-A11 alleles when bound to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) peptides.6",

In transplants that are KIR-ligand mismatched in the graft-versus-host (GvH) direction, donor NK cells expressing inhibitory KIRs, which do not recognize ligand(s) on recipient targets, are released from HLA inhibition and mediate alloreactions leading to clinically significant graft-versus-leukemia effects. Clinical studies in haploidentical7, 8, 9 and in some (un)related donor transplants10, 11, 12 showed that KIR-ligand incompatibilities in the GvH direction are associated with a decreased incidence of relapse and improved disease-free and overall survival (OS) after HSCT. Several unrelated donor transplant studies did not, however, report any effect.13, 14, 15, 16, 17",

Moreover, as HLA-A3/-A11 KIR-ligand mismatches were not encountered in haploidentical transplants, we decided to include them in our evaluation. As HLA-A3/-A11 alleles were reported to function as KIR ligands when bound to EBV peptides, we hypothesized that, in view of the frequent EBV reactivation after transplantation, EBV peptides were readily available for HLA-A3/-A11 binding, with the possible generation of HLA-A3/-A11-specific donor NK cells that were alloreactive against target cells from recipients lacking HLA-A3 and/or HLA-A11.",

In fact, donor-versus-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity was predicted on the basis of KIR-ligand mismatching without the direct assessment of the donor alloreactive NK-clone repertoire or donor KIR genotyping. However, it is worth noting that KIR genotyping is required in only a minority of donors as most possess a full complement of inhibitory KIR genes and have the potential to exert NK alloreactions. Moreover, the risk of misclassification arises when the donor does not possess/express the relevant KIR to exert alloreactivity. Under this circumstance, KIR-ligand mismatching mistakenly classifies a non-NK-alloreactive transplant pair as NK alloreactive. Therefore, in our series, such \u2018false positives\u2019 might have \u2018contaminated/diluted\u2019 the NK-alloreactive cohort. Thus, the only conceivable consequence of such misclassification is an underestimation of the effects of NK alloreactivity, which reinforces, rather than detracts from, our core observation that NK-cell alloreactivity favorably impacts on outcomes of cord blood transplantation.",

This finding is in accordance with clinical and in vitro data from Ruggeri et al.,8 who showed that AML cells were killed in vitro by alloreactive NK clones, whereas only a sub-population of ALL cells was sensitive to NK-cell alloreactivity. As we observed a small but consistent KIR-ligand effect in our ALL patients, the data suggest that subgroups of ALL (T- or B-lineage ALL) may show differential sensitivities to donor NK-cell alloreactivity.",

Surprisingly, HLA-A3/-A11 mismatching in the GvH direction emerged as just as good a predictor of favorable prognosis as HLA-C and HLA-Bw4 group mismatches. Our use of HLA-A3/-A11 mismatching as a predictor of NK-cell alloreactivity may be criticized, as the role of HLA-A3/-A11 as a ligand for KIR3DL2 is controversial. As HLA-A3/-A11 alleles were reported to function as KIR ligands when bound to EBV peptides,6 it seems reasonable that, in view of frequent EBV reactivation after transplantation, EBV peptides were readily available for HLA-A3/-A11 binding, with the possible generation of HLA-A3/-A11-specific donor NK cells that were alloreactive against target cells from recipients lacking HLA-A3 and/or HLA-A11. In our data set, EBV status was reported in only 74 patients (36%), of which 58 (78%) were EBV positive. No data on EBV reactivation are available in the Eurocord database. Thus, the role of HLA-A3/-A11 as a KIR ligand cannot be further supported in this study.",

            "text": "This analysis shows that donor-versus-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity exerts a beneficial impact not only in haploidentical but also in cord blood transplantation. These two types of SCT have in common that the donors are highly HLA mismatched with the recipient, whereas after SCT, relatively little severe GvHD is observed. The post-transplant period is further characterized by a rapid recovery of NK cells and long-lasting T-cell immunoincompetence. As T cells in the cord blood graft are antigen inexperienced, they contain few or no cytotoxic T cells directed against viral and bacterial peptides, which may cross-react with HLA alloantigens. The relative lack of post-thymic T cells and the T-cell naivety may be responsible for the lower-than expected frequency of severe GvHD, even in the setting of one or two HLA mismatches, and for the delayed recovery of T-cell function after UCBT31, 32, 33 to the same degree as after haploidentical SCT. Lack of memory T cells in the graft (due to T-cell depletion in haploidentical and T-cell naivety in cord blood transplants) apparently permits the recovery of fully functional NK cells. Interestingly, one study comparing T cell-depleted-versus-repleted unrelated donor transplants demonstrated that T cells in the graft adversely affected reconstitution of KIR-bearing NK cells and clinical outcomes.34 Additional evidence that T cells antagonize reconstitution of potentially alloreactive, KIR-bearing NK cells derives from several other unrelated donor transplant studies, using T-cell-replete grafts.10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 33, 35 Most studies showed no advantage in transplantation from KIR-ligand-mismatched donors,13, 14, 15, 30, 31, 36, 37, 38 whereas a few observed an increased graft-versus-leukemia effect.10, 11, 39, 40, 41",
