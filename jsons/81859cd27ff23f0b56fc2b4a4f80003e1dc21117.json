Comparing to the total number of infected cases, the percentage of pediatric cases might be high. Of these cases, all have a fever and there is a history of closed contact to infected patients in the family within 3 days. These cases were hospitalized and had a complete recovery. Since the cases are early detected by screening of risk contact person to the known COVID-19 cases, the patients did not show any serious lung abnormality, no lung infiltration from chest computed tomography (CT). 3 Indeed, different clinical features and chest CT findings are observed in COVID-patients at different stages. The early diagnosis of pediatric COVID-19 in our setting might result",
