Piglets up to the age of 3 weeks die from diarrhea caused by the viral gastroenteritis unless they are protected by antibodies. In addition to the cellular receptor, porcine aminopeptidase N, the TGEV spike protein binds to sialic acid residues. We have shown that the sialic acid binding activity mediates the binding of TGEV to a mucin-like glycoprotein present in porcine brush border membranes. This was shown by performing a virus overlay binding assay with proteins obtained from brush border membranes by lectin precipitation. Because of the reactivity with specific lectins we assume that the recognized glycoprotein has the characteristics of a mucin.",

It has been shown that the spike (S) protein of TGEV has, in addition to its pAPN binding site, a sialic acid binding activity, which is located at the N-terminal region of the protein (2). We have shown that binding to sialoglycoproteins in cell culture and in porcine brush border membrane preparations may be a pathogenicity factor affecting the enteropathogenicity of TGEV (3, 4) . Virus mutants that were not able to bind to sialic acids did not infect piglets (5,6). Thus, binding to sialoglycoproteins or mucins in the gastrointestinal tract may help the virus to reach the cellular receptor pAPN. The sialoglycoproteins serve as first attachment factors.",

Lectin precipitates were further used for a virus overlay binding assay. The lectins used in this study were wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which specifically binds N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acids; peanut agglutinin (PNA), which specifically recognizes galactose-\u2424(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine, a disaccharide present in O-glycosylated proteins; and jacalin, which binds to the same sugars as PNA. The advantage of jacalin is that in contrast to PNA it binds to galactose-\u2424(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine without prior neuraminidase treatment. In this way the specific lectin precipitation can be well combined with the virus binding to sialic acids. A high-molecular-mass protein that is recognized by the sialic acid binding activity of TGEV was also readily recognized by WGA and jacalin, suggesting that this sialoglycoprotein is highly O-glycosylated. Therefore we designated it mucin-like glycoprotein (MGP). ",

The mucosa of fresh jejunum from sacrificed suckling piglets is abraded from the serosa and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples are stored at -80 \u2022 C until use. 2. All preparation steps are performed on ice at 4 \u2022 C. 3. The mucosa is weighed and 150 ml of preparation buffer A is added. 4. After thawing on ice the mucosa is mixed in a regular household mixer on level 4 twice for 1 min each. After each mixing step, the suspension is filled in a tumbler and left on ice for 2 min. Then the foam is sucked off. 5. The volume of the homogenate is determined in a measuring cylinder. 6. The basolateral brush border membranes are precipitated by adding 1 M MgCl 2 in an amount of 1/100 of the homogenate volume. The MgCl 2 solution is added drop by drop under continuous stirring on ice followed by further stirring on ice for 15 min. 7. The complete homogenate is then centrifuged for 18 min, 3687 \u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C (see Note 7). After centrifugation the supernatant is poured into fresh centrifuge beakers. 8. In a second centrifugation step for 40 min, 16,000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C, the apical brush border membrane fraction is pelleted (see Note 8). The pellet is floated in 35 ml of preparation buffer B; i.e., the buffer is rinsed over the pellet until the sediment is detached from the bottom. The floating pieces of the pellet are then homogenized ten times using a potter. 9. To further purify the preparation, the MgCl 2 precipitation is repeated followed by a centrifugation for 10 min, 3293 \u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C (see Note 9). 10.

After a final centrifugation step for 40 min, 31,300 \u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C, the brush border membranes are homogenized in 1 to 3 ml vesicle buffer by using a 1-ml syringe and a 0.45 \u00d7 23-gauge needle (see Note 11). 12. The protein content of the brush border membrane preparation is estimated by using the Bradford assay (BIORAD). To make all protein binding sites available, surface-active saponine (1%) is added in a ratio of 1:2 to all samples. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature the Bradford staining reagent is added. Then the inoculum is removed and 20 ml DMEM is added to each plate followed by an incubation at 37 \u2022 C for about 24 h (see Note 13). 2. As soon as the CPE is observed, the cell culture supernatant is harvested and centrifuged at 1900 \u00d7 g for 10 min, 4 \u2022 C, to remove cell debris. The resulting supernatant is subjected to ultracentrifugation at 120,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h, 4 \u2022 C, to pellet the virus particles (see Note 14). The resulting pellets are resuspended in PBS (total volume 400 to 500 l). 3. To make all sialic acid binding sites on the S protein available, a neuraminidase treatment of the concentrated virus particles is performed. Neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (1 U/ml, DADE Behring) is used in a final concentration of 50 mU/ml. The sample is then incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min and cooled on ice. 4. For purification of the virions, a continuous sucrose gradient (20-50% w/w in PBS) with a 60% sucrose cushion is prepared. The sucrose solutions are stirred at 50 \u2022 -60 \u2022 C and stored at room temperature until use. For the gradient centrifugation, SW 50.1 tubes, ultraclear (Beckman), are used (see Note 15). Per tube, 0.5 ml of the 60% sucrose cushion is applied overlaid by a gradient of 20 and 50% sucrose (using a gradient mixer and a pump). 2.5 ml of the 20% and 2 ml of the 50% solution are put into the gradient mixer. The gradient has a height corresponding to a 4-ml volume. The virus suspension is then carefully put on the top of the gradient using a 100-l pipette. For purification, the gradient is ultracentrifuged at 150,000 \u00d7 g for 3 h, 4 \u2022 C (see Note 16). 5. After centrifugation, the visible virus band is carefully harvested using a 1-ml syringe and a 0.9 \u00d7 40-gauge needle (see Note 17). After dilution with PBS to a total volume of 4.5 ml, the virions are pelleted by ultracentrifugation (SW 50.1) at 150,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h, 4 \u2022 C (see Note 16). The viral particles are resuspended in a small volume of PBS (depending on the pellet size in 100 to 300 l). The sample is stored in aliquots at -20 \u2022 C. The purity of the preparation is tested in an SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining of the proteins in the gel. The protein concentration is determined photometrically at 280 nm (see Note 18). ",

For this purpose a semidry blotting system with two graphite electrodes is used. Six sheets of filter paper have to be soaked in anode I buffer, three filters in anode II buffer, and nine sheets of paper have to be soaked in the cathode buffer. The nitrocellulose membrane is wetted with pure water before use. Prior to use, all sheets and the membrane are cut to a size of 6 \u00d7 8 cm (just a bit larger than the size of the separating gel). 2. The power supply is switched off and the gel unit is disassembled. The stacking gel is cut and discarded. One edge of the separating gel is cut to have a better orientation for blotting. 3. The anode I papers are taken with a pinzette and excess buffer and air bubbles are eliminated from the papers by stripping with clean gloves. The papers are then placed onto the anode and the anode II papers placed onto the anode I papers like a sandwich. 4. The nitrocellulose membrane is carefully taken out of the pure water and put on the papers. A little water is put on the upper side of the membrane, the better to get the gel from the glass slides by creating capillary forces. The free side of the gel is laid on the membrane, and the remaining glass slide on the other side is lifted carefully. A spacer is used to loosen the gel from the slide. After removing possible air bubbles, the cathode papers are put on the gel as described above for the anode papers. 5. With a glass pipette residual air bubbles are stripped out of the sandwich and the cathode is put on the top. About 2 kg are put on the blotting apparatus (e.g., two bottles with 1 liter each) and the apparatus is connected to the power supply. The running conditions are 0.8 mA/cm 2 . For one membrane with 6 \u00d7 8 cm use 38 mA and let the apparatus run for 1 h. 6. Once the transfer is completed, switch off the power supply and carefully lift the upper electrode. Normally some of the papers stick to this upper side. Search for the position of the gel and control if the prestained marker is visible on the nitrocellulose membrane. Discard the gel and mark the bands of the marker with a ballpoint pen because they sometimes get lost during later incubation steps. 7.

Fig. 1 . Binding of TGEV to lectin-precipitated brush border membrane proteins from two different suckling piglets (S1, S2). Brush border membranes were treated either with neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (+VCNA) or mock-treated (-VCNA) and then precipitated with: (a) wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), (b) jacalin, or (c) peanut agglutinin (PNA) agarose. A virus overlay binding assay was performed after blotting of the brush border membrane proteins. Two main bands were recognized by the virus after lectin precipitation. The lower band of about 150 kDa presents the cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN). The PNA-precipitation (c, right side) shows clearly that binding to pAPN is not sialic-acid-dependent. TGEV binding to the high-molecular-mass band (arrow) is clearly sialic-acid-dependent, as after VCNA treatment binding is eliminated or at least strongly reduced. The strong precipitation of MGP by WGA gives a hint that it is highly sialylated or has a strong content of N-acetylglucosamine. Jacalin binds to galactose-\u2424(1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine, a disaccharide present in O-glycosylated proteins. The strong MGP band (b) demonstrates that this protein is highly O-glycosylated. Therefore we designated it mucin-like glycoprotein (MGP). For the same reason it is precipitated by PNA (c), but PNA precipitation is not as good without neuraminidase treatment. After neuraminidase treatment (+VCNA) the virus is not able to bind to MGP because of the missing sialic acids. 6 . After the next washing period (three times for 10 min each, at room temperature with PBS-0.1% T), the membrane is incubated with streptavidin biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham/GE Healthcare) diluted 1:5000 in 10 ml PBS-0.05% T for 1 h at 4 \u2022 C on a rocking platform. 7. The peroxidase complex dilution is discarded followed by three washings for 10 min each with PBS-0.1% T at room temperature. 8. The bound peroxidase is detected by chemoluminescence using the BM Chemoluminescence Blotting Substrate (Roche) or Super Signal R (Pierce) for the detection of weaker signals (see Note 24). The chemoluminescence signal can be visualized with an X-ray film or by using the Gel Documentation System ChemiDoc from BioRad (Fig. 1 ).",

In this way the original bottle is not opened too frequently, retaining the quality of the TEMED. 4. Never adjust the pH of the running buffer, e.g. with HCl. This will disturb the running conditions during electrophoresis. The buffer has to be used without pH adjustment. 5. It is better for the environment to use ethanol for buffers instead of methanol, which has to be discarded separately under specific conditions. 6. The pH of the PBS solution has to be at 7.5 without any adjustment. It just has to be checked. 7.

The \"white\" virus particle band can best be seen with the help of scattering light produced by an external light source. The needle has to be carefully directed vertically into the tube from the top up to the height of the band. The harvested volume should not exceed 1 ml per tube. 18. Different dilutions of BSA or transferrin are used as a standard. For the first measurement, the virus preparation is diluted 1:100. Sometimes higher concentrations have to be measured to get an extinction reading in a representative range. With the standard staining methods that are used by most of the assays for the determination of protein concentration (e.g., BCA assay) it is not possible to detect the TGEV proteins, so the photometric measurement at 280 nm is used. 19. 16,000 \u00d7 g corresponds to 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. 20. For blocking, different buffers as well as nonfat dry milk were tried. A lot of them, especially the nonfat dry milk, lead to high backgrounds in the virus overlay binding assay. With blocking reagent from Roche, high backgrounds owing to the wrong blocking substance can be avoided. 21. Vigorous washing of the membrane is necessary as in a virus overlay binding assay high backgrounds could be a problem. 22. For reduction of a possible background, virus and antibodies are diluted in PBS-0.05% T instead of just PBS. 23. By using Parafilm one needs just 500 l virus or antibody dilution for one membrane. In this way the virus preparation lasts for a longer time. 24. Usually Super Signal R (Pierce) is used, as the signals after the virus overlay assay may be quite weak. If the signals are stronger, it is better to use BM Chemoluminescence Blotting Substrate (Roche) as the background is lower with this substrate.",

Pour the gel (\u223c4 ml), leaving about 1 cm of space for the stacking gel and overlay with isopropanol. The gel should polymerize within 30 min. 3. Pour off the isopropanol. Prepare the stacking gel by mixing 3.4 ml distilled water with 0.63 ml Tris-HCl (1 M, pH 6.8), 0.83 ml acrylamide/bis solution (30%), 50 l SDS (10% in water), 50 l ammonium persulfate solution (10% in water), and 10 l TEMED. Pour about 0.5-1 ml of this mixture over the polymerized separating gel and insert the comb. The stacking gel should polymerize within 30 min. 4. Prepare the running buffer by diluting 100 ml of the 10X running buffer with 900 ml of water. Use a measuring cylinder. Invert the bottle to mix. 5. Once the stacking gel has solidified, assemble the gel running unit. Carefully remove the comb and wash the wells with running buffer by using, e.g., a Hamilton Microlitre syringe. 6. Add the running buffer to the lower and upper chambers of the gel unit and load 20 l of each sample in a well. Load one well with 2.5-5 l prestained molecular weight marker filled up to 20 l with 2X SDS sample buffer. 7. Connect the gel unit to a power supply. Run the gel at 80 V until the dye front of the sample buffer is a sharp line and leaves the stacking gel. It is then possible to run the gel at 150 V until the dye front runs off the gel. The whole running time of the gel is about 1.5 h.",
