The viral replication in MDMs co\u2010cultured with PMNs was not shown when cultures were performed with GL (Figure 1a). In the next experiments, MDMs were exposed to 1580 TCID50 per ml of R5 HIV and co\u2010cultured with PMNs. As compared with the control (the growth of R5 HIV in MDMs), the viral replication in MDMs co\u2010cultured with PMNs enhanced eightfold (Figure 1b). At this time, the viral replication was completely inhibited by GL in co\u2010cultures between MDMs and PMNs (Figure 1b). A dose\u2013response inhibitory effect of GL in the co\u2010cultures between MDMs exposed to 1580 TCID50 per ml of R5 HIV and healthy PMNs was examined. As shown in Figure 1c, significant inhibition of the viral replication was shown, when GL at doses ranging from 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 to 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121 was added to the cultures.

In these studies, the anti\u2010HIV activity of GL was displayed through the induction of CCL4 and CCL5 production. One of the cellular entry sites of R5 HIV (CCR5) on the surface of target cells is blocked by these chemokines.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n In addition, anti\u2010R5 HIV activity of GL was shown in monocytes, which were previously treated with 1\u2010methyladenosine.\n15\n CCR5 expression in monocytes was stimulated by CCL2 and IL\u201010, which were released from the same monocytes treated with 1\u2010methyladenosine. However, in the presence of GL, CCL2 and IL\u201010 were not produced by monocytes treated with 1\u2010methyladenosine.\n15\n In this paper, the inhibitory effect of GL on R5 HIV replication in MDMs co\u2010cultured with PMNs was examined. The replication of R5 HIV in MDMs was greatly enhanced when these cells exposed to the virus were co\u2010cultured with PMNs. Enhanced R5\u2010HIV replication in MDMs co\u2010cultured with PMNs was inhibited by 1\u2013100 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of GL. Over 95% inhibition of the viral replication was shown when GL at a dose of 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121 was added to the co\u2010cultures. A 50% inhibition was shown when 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of GL was added to the co\u2010cultures.

In addition, we tested the toxicity of GL on human PMNs. By trypan blue dye\u2010exclusion test, 90% or more of PMNs were shown to be viable, after cultivation of healthy donor peripheral blood PMNs (1 \u00d7 106 cells ml\u22121) for 18 h with RPMI\u20101640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 300 \u03bcg ml\u22121 GL. Under microscopic examination, morphological changes of 18 h\u2010cultured PMNs with GL were not shown. These previous descriptions and our data indicate that cytotoxic properties of GL are not involved in its antiviral activity against R5 HIV replication in MDMs co\u2010cultured with PMNs.",

Some soluble factors released from PMNs have been indicated as effector molecules to enhance the replication of R5 HIV in MDMs, because the viral replication has been greatly enhanced in MDMs transwell cultured with PMNs. Indeed, the enhanced viral replication was not shown when a mixture of mAbs directed against CCL2 and IL\u201010 was added to this transwell culture.\n13\n In contrast, without PMNs, replication of R5 HIV was greatly enhanced in MDM cultures supplemented with a mixture of rCCL2 and rIL\u201010. In this study, the replication of R5 HIV was not enhanced in MDMs and PMNs transwell cultures supplemented with GL. However, the enhanced R5 HIV replication in MDM cultures supplemented with a mixture of rCCL2 and rIL\u201010 was not influenced by GL. GL suppressed the released of CCL2 and IL\u201010 from PMNs influenced by R5 HIV.
