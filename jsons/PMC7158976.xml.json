            "text": "Cardiovascular diseases represent one of the leading causes of death globally [1]. Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory pathology characterized by deposition of plaques (a collection of fat, cholesterol, calcium, fibrin, and cellular waste products) in the walls of arteries, is the dominant cause of cardiovascular diseases [2]. The partial rupture and detachment of these plaques increase the risk of clogging the blood flow, which, ultimately, can lead to highly incapacitating or even mortal conditions such as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents [3]. The exact cause of atherosclerosis remains a subject of discussion and has been connected to several distinct mechanisms, hypotheses, and theories [4\u201316]. Nonetheless, despite its complexity, atherosclerosis is generally correlated to the levels of cholesterol in plasma [17\u201322]. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase is involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and is subject to feedback regulation by end-products of this same pathway [23\u201326]. Thus, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase with statins became an essential strategy for the primary prevention of atherosclerosis. Statins contain a dihydroxycarboxylic acid moiety that mimics and outcompetes the natural substrate molecule HMG-CoA, preventing its reduction to mevalonate and further cholesterol synthesis [27, 28] (Fig. 1a).\n",

            "text": "In addition to the cholesterol-lowering action, the success of statins became increasingly connected with broader pleiotropic effects [29\u201332]. Statins are increasingly being associated with potential protective effects on pathologies beyond cardiovascular diseases (e.g., respiratory [33\u201337], carcinogenic [38\u201343], viral [44\u201348], neurodegenerative [49\u201353]). The exact off-target mechanisms of statins, along with the reason why many patients show resistance to this class of drugs, are still unknown. Therefore, an increase of specific knowledge of the subcellular mechanisms affected by statins and the development of a more sensitive tool to investigate this subject are currently challenging hot topics in medicinal chemistry [54, 55]. High-resolution molecular imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET), together with sensitive nuclear analytical techniques relying on radiolabeled molecules, can help in a better understanding by mapping the biodistribution profile over time within complex living organisms. To this purpose, we report the 18F-labeling of atorvastatin (12), one of the most widely used statins in the prevention of cardiovascular risk factors and one of the best-selling drugs in pharmaceutical history [56]. Exchanging the aryl fluoride with its 18F radioisotope enables the radiolabeling of atorvastatin without changing its pharmacological properties. However, in the case of atorvastatin, the 18F-fluorination of electron-rich arenes is a classical struggle in radiochemistry and has challenges associated with synthesis automation [57]. The fluorine-containing aromatic ring within the atorvastatin structure is electron-rich, and therefore, we use the ruthenium-mediated radiodeoxyfluorination strategy [58\u201360] to synthesize [18F]atorvastatin ([18F]12). This radiotracer may have the potential to become an attractive tool for statin-related research, enabling the understanding of cellular and subcellular mechanisms, the identification of off-target activity and, ultimately, allowing to select between statin-resistant and non-resistant patients for targeted therapy.",

The [18F]fluoride was then eluted from the cartridge with a solution of the labeling precursor 8 (2.5 \u03bcmol), N,N-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl-1-chloroimidazolium chloride (13, 6.0 equiv.), and bis(trimethylneopentylammonium) oxalate in a mixture of ethanol:pivalonitrile:veratrole (400 \u03bcL, 1:4:4 v:v:v) directly into a reaction vial [60]. The reaction mixture was heated under vigorous stirring at 140 \u00b0C for 30 min to afford the key intermediate [18F]11. A drawback of this literature procedure is the reduced elution efficiency from the anion exchange cartridge. Besides, there is no commercial supplier of the oxalate salt. This may hinder good manufacturing/radiopharmaceutical/clinical practice (GMP/GRPP/GCP) applications with the synthesized radiotracer as additional analytical evaluations, toxicity tests, and reliable and established production of the additive may be needed to comply with potential clinical trials in human patients [63]. As mentioned in a previous report [58], salt additives tend to reduce the 18F-deoxyfluorination yield even though the elution efficiency is increased. Thus, in this work, several readily available additives were evaluated in order to achieve a better elution alternative that can increase the elution efficiency while minimally affecting the 18F-deoxyfluorination yield (Table 1).\n",

Using a mixture of methanol:veratrole (1:3 v:v) or methanol:DMSO (1:3 v:v) provided the best results. However, the mixture with veratrole quickly builds up high pressure in the reaction vial at 140 \u00b0C (with some associated radioactivity escape). Thus, replacing veratrole by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is the safer choice of solvent. This optimized method boosted and simplified the 18F-deoxyfluorination technique by avoiding the addition of salt additives, skipping any need for washing the trapped [18F]fluoride, circumventing time-consuming azeotropic drying (with the consequent radioactivity losses by natural decay, evaporation, and unspecific adsorption to the reactor surface) and the use of different solvent mixtures for the various steps of the process (elution and 18F-fluorination). The amount of Ru-coordinated precursor 8 was also reduced in relation to the previously reported 18F-deoxyfluorination works (2.5 \u03bcmol vs. 5.0 \u03bcmol) [58\u201360]. During the optimization work, it became evident that some procedure deviations such as air bubbling instead of stirring, absence of mechanical mixing, increased solvent volumes, larger reaction vials, or flat-shaped bottom ones can decrease the final 18F-deoxyfluorination yield. In order to enhance the radiolabeling efficiency, these are features that should be considered when choosing the most suitable radiosynthesis module.",

All unused loading ports to the reaction vial were closed with perfluoroalkoxy plugs, except one that was left open with an ethylene tetrafluoroethylene female luer-to-male fitting for connection to an exhaust alumina N cartridge (Waters). In summary, aqueous [18F]fluoride was trapped on a Chromafix 45-PS-HCO3\u2212 anion exchange cartridge preactivated by sequentially passing 3 mL of K2C2O4 (10 mg/mL) and 2 mL of water and dried with a flow of argon (trapping efficiency, 94% \u00b1 4%; n = 10). After drying the resin in the cartridge under helium flow for approximately 1 min, the trapped [18F]fluoride was eluted by pushing a solution of the Ru-coordinated labeling precursor 8 (2.5 \u03bcmol) and N,N-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl-1-chloroimidazolium chloride (13, 6.0 equiv.) in methanol:DMSO (1:3 v:v, 0.4 mL) over 2 min through the cartridge, directly to a reaction vial preheated at 110 \u00b0C (elution efficiency, 88 \u00b1 5%; n = 10). This preheating seems to avoid the significant radioactivity losses that were seen when rapidly increasing from room temperature to the reaction temperature or when the reaction vial was already set at 140 \u00b0C. The reaction was left to stir for 30 min at 140 \u00b0C to produce the intermediate [18F]11 (18F-deoxyfluorination yield estimated by multiplying radio-TLC conversion of [18F]fluoride with radio-HPLC purity, 87 \u00b1 9%; n = 10). The ketal and tert-butyl protecting groups were removed by sequentially treating the reaction mixture with 1 mL of methanol:HCl 6 M (49:1 v:v) at 60 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by addition of 0.5 mL of methanol:aqueous NaOH 50% (9:1 v:v) and stirring at 60 \u00b0C for another 5 min.

Final solid-phase extraction (SPE) enabled the solvent exchange, and [18F]12 was then reformulated in a physiological and injectable calcium acetate solution to mimic the atorvastatin (12) calcium preparation in which the therapeutic dose of this drug is generally administered. The radiochemical yield of [18F]atorvastatin ([18F]12) was 19 \u00b1 6%, n = 10 (d.c.), and the molar activity was 65 \u00b1 32 GBq\u00b7\u03bcmol\u22121 (n = 10) at the end of synthesis. The activity yield achieved for [18F]12 was 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 GBq (n.d.c.) when starting with 9.6 \u00b1 1.9 GBq of aqueous [18F]fluoride produced in cyclotron (n = 10).\n",

[18F]Atorvastatin-PET might become a relevant research tool for the assessment of statin-related mechanisms of action and to discriminate between responsive and non-responsive patients. Standard atorvastatin (12) is known to occupy the binding site of HMG-CoA reductase with high affinity (Ki approx. 14 nM [27]) and effectiveness (IC50 approx. 8 nM [74]). Thus, the pre-treatment of the liver sections with atorvastatin (12) hinders the access of additional substrate to the active site. By incubating rat liver sections, widely known to highly express HMG-CoA reductase [65\u201367], with [18F]atorvastatin ([18F]12), the expected selective binding to this enzyme was confirmed since a statistically significant decrease of the uptake was observed when the hepatic tissue was pre-treated with non-radioactive atorvastatin (12).",

The uptake of the radiotracer was statistically significant higher in atherosclerotic aorta when compared to a healthy rat aorta. Furthermore, the pre-treatment with the reference compound 12 blocked [18F]atorvastatin ([18F]12) binding, which supported the potential of this PET tracer to be used for the specific detection of atherosclerotic plaques.
