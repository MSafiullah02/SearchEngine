Objectives: To evaluate clinical applicability of multiplex real-time PCR. Study design: An assay targeting influenza virus A (IfA) and B (IfB), parainfluenza 1-3 (PIV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), enterovirus (EV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63), M. pneumoniae and Ch. pneumoniae was developed and run daily on consecutive clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. Results: An etiology was identified in 48% of the 954 samples, with IfA in 25%, RV in 20%, MPV in 10% and M. pneumoniae in 10% of the positive. By a rational procedure costs could be reduced and the customer price set relatively low (D 33 per sample).

A significant part of these infections are caused by viral pathogens (Creer et al., 2006; Diaz et al., 2007) . It is often difficult for the clinician to distinguish between viral and bacterial aetiologies, and this may result in overuse of antibiotics (Lundborg et al., 2002) . Diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections using viral culture, antigen detection or serology is either too slow or too insensitive to be applicable in clinical practice (Gunson et al., 2005) . The more reliable, specific and sensitive PCR methods have not yet won acceptance as the first choice for diagnosis owing to the high cost when several agents are targeted. Recently, multiplex assays that detect a large number of viral agents have been described.

We have also noted that inclusion of bacterial agents has promoted the willingness from clinicians to use our service, probably because Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Ch. pneumoniae infections may require antibiotic treatment. Viral detection may support the clinician's decision to avoid antibiotics, or may prompt antiviral treatment such as oseltamivir (against influenza) to the patient or exposed family members. Identifying the aetiology also allows the clinician to better inform the patient about the prognosis and ways of limiting the spread to other individuals. We therefore believe that an expanded use of molecular diagnostics of respiratory infections is of great clinical value. It should, of course, be kept in mind that viral agents detected by highly sensitive assays might reflect asymptomatic infection rather that being the cause of the present illness, and that an identified viral agent does not exclude concomitant bacterial infection. To some extent, the probability that a given agent constitutes an aetiological agent should be related to the Ct value: The lower Ct value, the higher the probability, and this may also be of relevance for the interpretation of double infections.
