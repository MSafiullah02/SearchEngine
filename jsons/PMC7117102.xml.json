The main clinical signs of BPIV3 infection are coughing, anorexia, pyrexia, nasal and ocular discharges, dyspnea and sometimes diarrhea (Zhu et al., 2011). Three BPIV3 genotypes, A (BPIV3a), B (BPIV3b) and C (BPIV3c) have been described and BPIV3a and BPIV3c have been found in Chinese cattle (Zhu et al., 2011). However, reports of PIV3 infection in goat/sheep are limited and the genetic characteristics of the virus have not been determined (Elazhary et al., 1984, Lamontagne et al., 1985, Lyon et al., 1997, Taylor et al., 1975). Furthermore, nothing is known about the circulation of PIV3 in goats/sheep in China and the relationship between virus infections and clinical diseases, as well as the relationship of small ruminants\u2019 PIV3 with BPIV3 and HPIV3.",

Most of the diseased goats (3\u20136 months) showed respiratory syndrome (coughing, nasal discharges, dyspnea), anorexia emaciation and some of them suffered diarrhea. The diseased goats usually showed no obvious body temperature changes. Antibiotic treatment had no apparent effect, although a few diseased animals recovered within 10\u201315 days.

In feedlot cattle, BRDC is considered the most significant disease, and BPIV3 plays an important role in BRDC development. Viral infection plus stress conditions and other secondary or co-infections result in severe clinical observations (Haanes et al., 1997, Maidana et al., 2012). However, there are few reports about related goat viral pathogens. Most previous reports regarding PIV3 in goat/sheep were published in the 1970s\u20131980s and only serological tests were done; thus, related virus genome characteristics and virus isolations had not been identified (Afshar and Terlecki, 1979, Elazhary et al., 1984, Kennedy-Stoskopf et al., 1983, Lamontagne et al., 1985, Lyon et al., 1997, Taylor et al., 1975). In the present cases, the goats were imported from different places and transport stress might trigger disease development. The diseased goats were treated with different antibiotics and did not show significant changes in clinical signs. The diseased and dead animals showed similar pathological characteristics. In the primary laboratory examination, several potential pathogens were tested. Most of the samples (56%) showed PIV3 positive results, and sequencing results indicated that viruses from different farms shared 100% identity, indicating the contribution of this novel PIV3 to this clinical disease. ORSV and M. ovipneumoniae were also detected from some samples, indicating different co-infection situations in different farms and this might result in the difference of recovery rate between farms; however, ORSV and M. ovipneumoniae were not the major causes of the goat infections. PIV3 was successfully isolated from nasal swabs and was intranasally infected into goats to assess its pathogenicity. From 4 to 10 dpi, viremia and virus shedding could be detected in all virus-inoculated goats; and 3/4 goats displayed coughing, with mild to moderate nasal discharges. Virus-specific HI antibodies were positive from 14 dpi (Table 4). These results further confirmed the goat-derived PIV3 strain had pathogenicity in goats. Of course, other potential unknown pathogens might also be present, requiring further studies.",

Blast searches of the 329 bp M region of JS2013 showed the highest identity of only 82% with Japanese BN-CE strain, indicating that JS2013 was distinct from the previously reported BPIV3 strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on this region gave the same result (data not shown). It was hypothesized that JS2013 might represent a potentially new group of PIV3. To confirm this hypothesis, several pairs of degenerate primers were designed to amplify the entire M and F coding region, partial N, HN and L gene fragments. The sequences were used for genetic and phylogenetic analysis. Similarly, the highest nucleotide identities of M, F, N, HN and L genes with reported strains in Genbank were only 76.9\u201383.5% (Table 3). The new PIV3 strain shared slightly higher identity with BPIV3 than HPIV3. As shown in Table 3, the F and HN genes and proteins possessed relatively lower identities while the L gene and protein had the highest identity with other sequences, suggesting that F and HN were highly varied among different strains. Considering that HN protein was an immunodominant protein of PIV3, HN-based serological methods and vaccine should be developed in the future.",

Therefore, M, F, HN and N genes were used for phylogenetic analysis in this study and they showed similar grouping results (Fig. 2): JS2013 was clearly differed from HPIV3 and other reported BPIV3 genotypes. The results presented here strongly indicate that JS2013 might represent a novel member of PIV3 in the respirovirus genus and the name caprine parainfluenza virus type 3 is proposed (Fig. 2). Full-length genome sequencing is currently underway for detailed understanding the genomic characteristics of this new virus.",

The pathogenicity of this new isolate needs further detailed studies and related preventative techniques should be developed.
