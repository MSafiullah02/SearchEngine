Two ordination techniques, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), were used. The values of slope, aspect, altitude and lithology information were provided by Geographic Information System (GIS), and geomorphological land units were determined by intersection of overlaid data layers. Plant sampling was undertaken within nine land units with similar lithology and altitude but which differed in slope and aspect, using 30 randomly selected 1 m 2 plots per land unit. Soil samples were taken from two depths (0-20 and 20-50 cm) in each plot. Organic matter, bulk density, texture, calcium carbonate, total nitrogen and available phosphorus and potassium contents were determined. The results indicated that plant species have different responses to edaphical and topographical parameters. The invader species group had a balanced amount of influence from all soil components and topographic factors, whereas the native grasses were located in productive soils, which typically have a low grazing intensity, such as the north facing slopes. Coniferous bushy trees, cushion plants and some shrub plant groups were found on steep slopes with alkaline soils. The broad-leaved bushy trees plant group was abundant in fine texture soils on low and humid slopes.",

In fact, vegetation groups are determined by the combined effects of a whole range of ecological factors. Thus, change in the soil, topography and grazing factors can lead to vegetation responses in each area of the landscape (Holechek et al. 1989) . Jangman et al. (1995) showed that vegetation ordination can be used to generate the ecological factor classes in each site. Plant species that appear in similar regions have equal ecologic requirements and can be defined as ''ecological species groups''. The regions that contain similar ecological species groups create ecological groups that are homogeneous habitats with similar ecologic and floristic composition, which can be used in habitat classification (Zahedi and Mohammadi 2002; Kashian 2003; Kooch et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "The DCA method is an indirect method to show species correlation. This method arranges vegetation data based on their presence or absence in sampling plots and shows species group locations at each site. First, this method calculates the magnitude of species composition change in the first ordination axis (lengths of gradient). Based on the calculated gradient, the type of analysis to be used for ordination is determined ( \u20213 for CCA, <3 for RDA). Species group separation is clearer in DCA. Furthermore, a group's border isn't always identifiable in CCA or RDA. Although, for determining the relationship between species and environmental data, direct methods are the best methods of ordination, DCA is more useful in species grouping (Hill and Gauch 1980; Jean and Bouchard 1993) . The combination of CCA and RDA is the complement of DCA. These new techniques select the linear combination of environmental variables that maximize species scores, whereas CCA chooses the best weights for the environmental variables (Zahedi 1998) . This gives the first CCA axis. In CCA, composite gradients are linear combinations of environmental variables, giving a much simpler analysis that provides a summary of the species-environment relationships. In vector diagrams, vector lengths show the efficacy of each factor, with a longer length indicating a stronger relationship. Also, closeness of species to a vector shows its responsiveness to that factor. Occurrence of a species near a vector indicates a positive relationship with that factor and its diminished relationship with the other factors (Jangman et al. 1987; Ghorbani et al. 2003) .",

Then, the information layers of slope, aspect, hypsography and lithology were created in GIS (Arc View 3.3). The geomorphologic land units (n = 66) map was obtained by overlaying the slope, aspect, hypsometric and lithologic layers ( Figure 2 ). From these land units nine, with similar lithology and altitude (2100-2200 m a.s.l.) but contrasting slopes and aspects, were selected. Some of the selected units shown in Figure 2 were merged because of their close similarities in most factors. Except in one land unit where 40 plots were sampled, sampling was conducted at 30 randomly chosen plots of 1 m 2 within each of the nine land units. Size and number of plots were obtained by minimal area and statistical methods, respectively (Kent and Coker 1996) . Topographic (slope and aspect) and vegetative characteristics (species names, cover, density and frequency percentage) were recorded by visual scores and subsequent calculations within each plot. Aspect data were calculated by angle conversion to northing; Heat Load = [1 ) cos(h ) 45)] \u2044 2 where h is the aspect value based on 360\u00b0with the highest heat being in the southwest quadrant. Soil samples were taken from 0-20 cm and 20-50 cm depths in each plot. Sub samples from well-mixed soil layers were analyzed for texture (Gee and Bauder 1982) , calcium carbonate (Nelson 1982) , organic matter (Nelson and Sommers 1982) , bulk density (Black and Hartge 1982) , total nitrogen (Bremner and Mulvaney 1982) , available phosphorus (Olsen and Sommers 1982) and available potassium (Knudson and Peterson 1982) .",

            "text": "The plant species reaction to abiotic factors in CCA analyses show that each species has reacted to one or several edaphic or topographic factors. In this case, the Group 1 invader species demonstrated the least reaction to these factors because the species of this group were all located close to the origin of coordinates and were not along the environmental gradient in two axes. However, these species were located some distance along the soil texture (silt and clay) and bulk density vectors ( Figure 4) . Also, their distribution is inversely related to soil elements (N, P, K), OC, sand, aspect and slope vectors. There were invader species such as Cirsium arvense, Centaurea solstitialis, Gundelia tournefortii, Eryngium caeruleum, Marrubium vulgare, Phlomis herbaventi, Euphorbia cheiradenia, Taraxacum vulgare and two species of Stachys genus in this group that Stachys spp. and Euphorbia cheiradenia are native plants but others are exotic. This is indicative of the intensive grazing pressure on this habitat since grazing animals deplete soil fertility in this environment (Toit et al. 2009 ). Moreover, low P soils on moderate slopes are likely caused by fertility transfer to flatter sites (Arzani et al. 2007 ). Livestock trampling under intensive grazing habitats has also increased soil bulk density (Han et al. 2008) and probably resulted in a mix of topsoil and subsurface soils as seen by the altered physical, chemical and biological properties, each of which can influence seed germination and survival (De Falco et al. 2009 ). On the other hand, the absence of distinct relationships between this group of invader species and abiotic factors is related to the absence of similar environmental factors because the effect of intensive grazing (as a human factor) has invoked other environmental factors, which have rearranged the ecological balance in these sections (Ghorbani et al. 2003; Jafari et al. 2004) . This finding confirms that of Andrieu et al. (2007) which found that invader species become abundant in these landscapes irrespective of local ecological conditions. The species in Group 2 belong to grasses. Abundance of these species is positively influenced by N, K, OC and C \u2044 N of soil, and aspect, but negatively influenced by CaCO 3 (alkaline soils), whereas subsoil bulk density had little impact. Abundance of grass species had no positive correlation to soil texture or slope, as the grasses were indifferent to slopes and soil texture. Because these grass species are sensitive to high grazing pressure, their distribution is restricted to low-intensity grazed landscapes, where soil fertility (nitrogen, potassium and organic matter) is sufficient to support good pasture production (Xie and Wittig 2004) . This is likely because grazing stimulates plant regrowth and absorption of soil nutrients. Also, erosion in intensively grazed landscapes depletes soil elements and decreases soil Correspondence between plant species and environment factors in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The further a point is from the origin, the greater is the influence of that factor(s) on the plant's presence. The closer the point is to an axis line, the stronger is the influence of that factor, relative to another factor, on the species presence in that part of the landscape.",

These changes, with physiographic effects, are important reasons for variations in soil fertility. These effects result in changing vegetation communities, which includes the opportunity for ingress of invader plants. Plant community species alter ecological relationships that can create new landscapes. Identification of these species and understanding of their relationships with environmental parameters can help range management planning.
