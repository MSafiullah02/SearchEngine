            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a novel viral respiratory illness caused by the MERS-CoV that was first described in June 2012 in a patient who was hospitalized with signs of severe respiratory tract infection. The patient later died from respiratory and renal failure [1], [2], [3]. According to the statistics provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) on June 10, 2019, a total of 2428 laboratory-confirmed cases of human MERS-CoV infection have been reported, with an estimated 838 deaths in 27 countries. The accumulated evidence suggested that MERS-CoV infections are characterized by high levels of systemic inflammatory cytokines/chemokines as well as immunopathology [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. High inflammatory cytokines and chemokines levels have been strongly correlated with poor disease outcomes, immunopathology and massive infiltration of the immune inflammatory cells into the lungs [10], [12]. Moreover, the stimulation of various cytokines, chemokines and innate immune cells has been associated with the appearance of cytokine storms, which occur during infections with pathogenic coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus [6], [13], [14]. In addition, increased IL-8 (CXCL8) levels play a key role in acute SARS infection, viral bronchiolitis pathogenesis, severe immunopathology, and disease enhancement during respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infection [10], [12], [15], [16], [17]. Likewise, increased levels of inflammatory IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1 cytokines have been associated with tissue damage and acute inflammatory responses leading to mortality and severe pathogenesis, as well as induction of the inflammatory loop [14], [18], [19]. MERS-CoV evades and antagonizes the antiviral immune response, as well as the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) signaling pathway and the IFN signaling cascade [20], [21], [22]. The disease pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection is complex, with various factors involved in the onset of severe pulmonary damage and dissemination of the virus to other organs. Th1 cells cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b2 and IL-2 play a key role in antiviral immunity by enhancing the toxic effects of CD8 T cells, stimulate NK cells and contribute to the regulation of cellular immunity [9], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 which mediate humoral immune response and stimulate antibody production [9], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Imbalanced Th1/Th2 cytokines/chemokines can contribute to the pathological change, inefficient clearing infections, and host susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases. In vivo data highlights the important roles of T cells in controlling and reducing the pathogenesis and decreasing MERS-CoV titers [30].",

To exclude effects of antiviral therapy on the expression of cytokines/chemokines understudy, the samples were collected before the initiation of any antiviral treatment for MERS-CoV. For the sputum sample collections, the patients were asked to rinse their mouth and gargle with water twice immediately before obtaining the sample and instructed not to expectorate saliva or postnasal discharge into the container during collection to reduce the possibility of contamination with upper respiratory tract fluids. Subsequently, the patient was requested to breathe and expectorate deep cough sputum directly into a sterile sputum cup (screw cap). Tracheal aspirate (TA) was collected via the endotracheal tube as reported elsewhere [31], [32]. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was collected by following a standardized protocol (technique, sampling, and procedure) as previously described [33], [34], [35]. The first BAL fluid aliquots recovered were discarded to reduce cross-contamination with upper respiratory tract fluids. In order to exclude the effect of viral co-infection with influenza A H1N1 on cytokines/chemokines expression levels, all MERS-CoV positive patients were screened for H1N1 by GeneXpert Flu (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 5\u201310 min. The cell-free supernatants were frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until they were used for subsequent analysis of the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine by ELISArray, as well as for the MERS-CoV viral load test. The pellets were used for total cellular RNA extraction using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)",

Five endogenous control genes provided by the array (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, and HSP90AB1) were used to calculate the arithmetic mean, which was then set as the Ct value for normalization. The online RT2-PCR Profiler data PCR array analysis software was used to identify the most appropriate reference genes to use for the normalization of the RT-PCR array gene expression data. Real-time RT-PCR array results were analyzed using the online RT2-PCR Profiler data PCR array analysis software (https://dataanalysis.qiagen.com/pcr/arrayanalysis.php).

A total of 26 genes involved in regulating the Th1 and Th2 immune response were downregulated in MERS-CoV infected patients (Table 4\n). The mRNA expression levels of 10 Th1-related cytokines/chemokines were downregulated. In contrast, the expression of only 6 Th1 cytokine/chemokine mRNAs, namely IL-18, IL-18R1, SOCS5, CCR2, CD4, and CXCR3, were upregulated (Table 4).

Previous studies have shown that dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immunopathology and fatal disease [6], [39], [40], [41]. As such, direct cytopathic effects, high virus titers, and viral evasion of host immune responses are believed to play a major role in the severity of the diseases resulting from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [6], [39], [40]. Our results showed high viral load (Ct) values in all MERS-CoV infected patients regardless of the specimen type (Table 3). Several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2, contribute to ARDS pathogenesis [6], [15], [42], [43], [44]. ARDS was shown to be the primary cause of death among patients with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections [6], [45]. In this study, the majority of MERS-CoV infected patients progressed to ARDS, subsequently developing pneumonia and requiring admission to an intensive care unit (ICU).",

Our results showed high expression levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 (CXCL8) in the lower respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected patients. Evidence from studies investigating SARS and respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) has revealed that IL-8 was associated with acute SARS infection, bronchiolitis, immunopathology and disease enhancement during HRSV infections [10], [12], [15], [16], [17]. IL-8 (CXCL8) is a critical chemokine involved in neutrophil recruitment, activation, and local neutrophil accumulation, and was shown to induce the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [44], [47]. NETs are highly immunogenic and extremely toxic to the host tissue, being able to directly cause inflammation, pathological changes, and epithelial and endothelial cell death [44], [48]. As such, lung NETs can increase inflammation by stimulating IL-8 expression, which leads to the recruitment of more neutrophils [44], [47]. We hypothesize that high IL-8 expression levels may cause NETosis, which results in severe MERS-CoV infection and increases immunopathology.",

In this study, high expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 were measured in the lower respiratory tracts of MERS-CoV infected patients. Previous studies have shown that the expression of IL\u20101\u03b2 during influenza A H1N1 infection increased lung inflammation, and subsequent treatment with an IL\u20101\u03b2 antagonist significantly reduced both inflammation and lung tissue damage, suggesting that IL\u20101\u03b2 is a critical cytokine that contributes to lung inflammation [51], [52]. Likewise, another study has shown that IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels were upregulated in Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV [10]. IL-1\u03b1 is an inflammatory cytokine that can be rapidly induced and quickly reaches high levels in response to a range of stimulants, such as IL-1\u03b2 and pathogenic agents [18], [53]. In mouse models, IL-1\u03b1 was shown to be a key player in triggering neutrophilic inflammation [18], [54]. Likewise, our results revealed high IL-1\u03b1 expression levels in MERS-CoV infected patients. Therefore, we think that high levels of IL-8, IL-1\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 may play a critical role in the immunopathology, severity, and case fatality of MERS-CoV infected patients.",

Thus, a loop of continued and self-perpetuating inflammation occurs, resulting in extensive tissue damage and pathological changes [18]. As such, elevated IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1 levels during acute MERS-CoV infection may cause an inflammatory loop that contributes to the extensive tissue damage and pathological changes associated with this disease, it is important to note that the IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels were not timely monitored at different intervals in this study. Thus, the proposed inflammatory loop may not be generalizable to cases with severe disease or patients treated by anti-inflammatory/antiviral drugs. It has been shown that effective control of host inflammatory response and antiviral treatment were associated with a reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels, steady improvement in disease condition, and pulmonary function [55], [56], [57], [58], [59]. Consequently, studying IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels at different intervals could assist in a better understanding of MERS-CoV immunopathology. We speculate that, monitoring of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels at different time points during MERS-CoV infection may alter the proposed inflammatory loop.",

In our study, the induction of TNF-\u03b1 was largely absent. Similarly, in a recent study, TNF-\u03b1 expression was not detected in most patients with MERS-CoV infections in the acute or convalescent stages [11]. This may indicate the limited early in vivo TNF-\u03b1 response during MERS-CoV infections. One explanation for the differences between in vitro and in vivo studies could be the different kinetics of the MERS-CoV responses in the in vitro model, where there is a gradual increase in gene expression over time. However, a more likely explanation is that the complex interplay of target cell infection, MERS-CoV replication, viral load and time of sample collection. We measured cytokines/chemokines levels and viral load at a single time point in the early phase of infection; assessing cytokines/chemokines concentrations and viral load at different time points during MERS-CoV infection to create a kinetic profile of cytokines/chemokines might yield additional information. Overall, the distinct TNF-\u03b1 responses in vitro and in vivo might impact on the in vivo pathogenesis and viral amplification.",

IFN\u03b3 plays an important role in early immunity, inducing the apoptosis of infected cells and stimulating both CD8+ and natural killer (NK) cells [62], [63]. In this study, both IFN\u03b3 and main Th1-associated cytokine mRNA expression levels were downregulated in the lower respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected patients. On the other hand, only 6 Th1-related cytokines and chemokines (IL-18, IL-18R1, SOCS5, CCR2, CD4, and CXCR3) were overexpressed in the lungs of MERS-CoV infected patients (Table 4). In regards to Th2-induced immune responses, 15 Th2 cytokines were downregulated. Th2 cytokines play an important role in the humoral immune response and promote antibody production. MERS-CoV infection completely downregulated the Th2 response in this study. We could not detect the mRNAs for the specific antiviral immune response in MERS-CoV infected patients. Reghunathan et al. also found a strong inflammatory response in acute SARS despite complete downregulation of the mRNA expression of genes involved in specific antiviral immune response [15].",

The upregulated Th1 cytokines/chemokines (IL-18, SOCS5, CCR2, and CXCR3) have been shown to play an important role in virus-induced immunopathology and usually associated with acute lung inflammation. IL-18 was associated with acute lung inflammation [64]. In addition, IL-18 was shown to enhance the severity of HRSV disease [65]. SOCS proteins affect antiviral signaling pathways, allowing viruses to evade the host immune response, and facilitate viral replication. Moreover, SOCS5 has been suggested to shape the presentation of viral disease [66], [67]. Previous data showed that, SOCS5 mRNA was significantly upregulated in response to H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H11N9. Suppressing SOCS signals improved influenza infection and inhibited HRSV replication [68], [69]. CCR2 mRNA upregulation was correlated with HRSV-disease severity [70]. CCR2 antagonism reduced pathology, morbidity, and mortality during influenza A (H1N1) infection [71]. During HRSV infection increased CXCR3 was associated with the underlying pathology [72]. In addition, it has been shown that blocking CXCR3 reduced immunopathology during respiratory virus infections [73]. Therefore, we think IL-18, SOCS5, CCR2, and CXCR3 overexpression may play a critical role in immunopathology, severity, and case fatality of MERS-CoV infected patients. Factors contribute to CD4 molecules upregulation during MERS-CoV infection in this study need further study. Previous data showed that, CD4 and CD8 expression on T cells were not altered by MERS-CoV infection [74]. MERS-CoV could persistently induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-8, which would up-regulate CD4 molecules to enhance helper T cell infection. Expression of high levels of IL-8 and the NET formation could have important effects on the CD4 expression.",

Viral co-infections could result in specific virus\u2010virus interactions [75]. However, the inflammatory response induced by one virus may not be significantly changed by the infection of a second or third virus [76]. We did not examine the influences of co-infections with other respiratory viruses on cytokines/chemokines expression levels. Any changes in immune profiles in MERS-CoV infected patients due to other respiratory pathogens are unknown. However, there is a possibility that other respiratory viral infections, which were not screened in our study, might skew immune profiles in MERS-CoV infected patients. We think that simultaneous study of other variables (ie, the interplay between MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses), which could potentially skew the data is likely required to assess any alterations of the immune profiles in MERS-CoV infected patients.",

First, we measured cytokines/chemokines expression levels and viral load at a single time point in the early phase of infection; assessing cytokines/chemokines expression levels and viral replication at different time points during MERS-CoV infection to create a kinetic profile might yield additional information. Second, in our study design, we did not include controls from patients infected with other respiratory viral pathogens. Third, we have screened MERS-CoV positive samples only for H1N1, we did not screen our samples for other respiratory viruses. Fourth, we were not able to recruit health non-infected individuals with similar MERS-CoV infected patients underlying diseases/pre-existing conditions. Future study designs to close these gaps need to be considered.",

Therefore, the high expression of inflammatory cytokines and downregulation of the Th1 and Th2 immune responses in the lower respiratory tracts of MERS-CoV infected patients may contribute to a more severe infection, higher case fatality, lung inflammation, and immunopathology. Furthermore, high levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines could be a key point in the subsequent development of pneumonia and ARDS in MERS-CoV infected patients. As such, the characterization of pulmonary Th1/Th2 response in MERS-CoV infection could be valuable for effective vaccine development and novel therapeutic strategies.",
