Indeed, most viral infections encountered in resource-rich countries were and still are, usually relatively trivial and transient with perhaps fever, malaise, myalgia, rash (exanthema) and sometimes mucosal manifestationsan enanthema, and these have been well documented (Scully and Samaranayake, 1992) .",

In addition, other viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been implicated in common but diverse oral lesions such as lichen planus/lichenoid lesions and sicca syndrome (Baccaglini et al, 2013) , the latter also sometimes arising after some other viral infections (Youinou et al, 2005) although the full aetiopathogenesis of Sjogren syndrome remains unclear (Kivity et al, 2014) .

Rare lethal and other dangerous viral infections were formerly seen mainly in, and reported from, resourcepoor areas of Asia, Latin America and Africa. Pandemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza viruses (both H5N1 and H1N1), heralded the surge of zoonotic virus outbreaks. Laboratory diagnosis of viral infections is traditionally based on the isolation of the virus, detection of viral nucleic acid or antigens, or serological confirmation (generally presence of IgM antibodies), and it is clear that the rate of discovery of new viruses is accelerating, due to a combination of true emergence of new pathogens, increasing awareness and the advance of new mainly molecular biology technologies making rapid detection and characterisation possible (Wang, 2011) . Various respiratory viruses and Ebola virus disease (EVD) in particular have served to awaken humanity to the related social inequalities and challenges.",
