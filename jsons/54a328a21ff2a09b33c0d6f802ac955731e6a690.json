Given the seriousness of the situation, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic as the Covid-19 rapidly around the world. Among its applications, chest X-ray images are frequently used for an early diagnostic/screening of Covid-19 disease, given the frequent pulmonary impact in the patients, critical issue to prevent further complications caused by this highly infectious disease. In this work, we propose complementary fully automatic approaches for the classification of chest X-ray images under the analysis of 3 different categories: Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. Given the similarity between the pathological impact in the lungs between Covid-19 and pneumonia, mainly during the initial stages of both lung diseases, we performed an exhaustive study of differentiation considering different pathological scenarios. To face these classification tasks, we exploited and adapted to this topic a densely convolutional network architecture, which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. To validate the designed approaches, several representative experiments were performed using images retrieved from different public chest X-ray images datasets. Overall, satisfactory results were obtained from the designed experiments, facilitating the doctors' work and allowing better an early diagnostic/screening and treatment of this relevant pandemic pathology.",

Today, given the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, radiologists are asked to prioritize chest X-rays of patients with suspected Covid-19 infection over any other imaging studies, allowing for more appropriate use of medical resources during the initial screening process and excluding other potential respiratory diseases, a process which is extremely tedious and time-consuming. In this context, the visibility of the Covid-19 infection in the chest X-ray is complicated and requires experience of the clinical expert to analyze and understand the information and differentiate the cases from other diseases of respiratory origin with similar characteristics such as pneumonia, as illustrated in Figure 1 . For that reason, a fully automatic system for the classification of chest X-ray images between healthy, pneumonia or specific Covid-19 cases is significantly helpful as it drastically reduces the workload of the clinical staff. Complementary, it may provides a more precise identification of this highly infectious disease, reducing the subjectivity of clinicians in the early screening process, and thus also reducing healthcare costs.

As reference, Sun et al. [11] proposed an approach based on deep transfer learning using chest X-ray images for the detection of patients infected with coronavirus pneumonia. In the work of Hassanien et al. [12] , the authors proposed a methodology for the automatic X-ray Covid-19 lung classification using a multi-level threshold based on Otsu algorithm and support vector machine for the prediction task. Apostolopoulos et al. [13] proposed a study on the possible extraction of representative biomarkers of Covid-19 from X-ray images using deep learning strategies. Wang et al. [14] proposed a deep convolutional neural network, called COVID-Net, design tailored for the detection of Covid-19 cases from chest radiography images. In the work of Hammoudi et al. [15] , the authors proposed a deep learning strategy to automatically detect if a chest X-ray image is healthy, pneumonia (bacterial or viral), assuming that a patient infected by the Covid-19, tested during an epidemic period, has a high probability of being a true positive when the result of the classification is a virus.",

Therefore, in order to offer a more comprehensive methodology we propose in this work complementary fully automatic approaches for the classification of Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy chest X-ray radiographs. To achieve this, we adapted to this issue a densely convolutional network architecture, which generally connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. In this way, the proposed approaches allow to make predictions using complete chest X-ray images of arbitrary sizes, which is very relevant considering the great variability of X-ray devices currently available in health centers. To validate our proposal, exhaustive representative experiments were performed using images compiled from different public image datasets. The manuscript is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the materials and methods that were used in this research work. Section 3 presents the results and validation of the proposed approaches. Section 4 includes the discussion of the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions about the proposed systems as well as possible future lines of work in this enormeous topic of interest.",

The technician will usually be behind a protected wall or in an adjacent room to activate the X-ray machine.

Subsequently, we tested the potential of this approach to classify chest X-ray radiographs of patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and measure their similarity with both situations.

Additionally, the classification step was performed with 5 repetitions, being calculated the mean cross-entropy loss [24] and the mean accuracy to illustrate the general performance and stability of the proposed approaches. The DenseNet-161 architecture was trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a constant learning rate of 0.01, a mini-batch size of 4 and a first-order momentum of 0.9. In particular, SGD is a simple but highly efficient approach for the discriminative learning of classifiers under convex loss functions [25] .",

To this end, we applied different configurations of affine transformations to increase the training data and improve the performance of the neural network architecture that was used to classify chest X-rays images.

Under the results of the analysis of the first approach, we designed another scenario with a screening context including Covid-19 cases by separating the pathological pneumonia and Covid-19 subjects with respect to healthy images With this in mind, in this case, the designed experiment included a total of 1242 X-ray images, being 828 from healthy patients whereas 207+207 from Covid-19 and pneumonia patients, respectively. In this case, we randomly selected the 828 healthy images and the 207 pneumonia images from the total amount of the used image dataset [16] .
