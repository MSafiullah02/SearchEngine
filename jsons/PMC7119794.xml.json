However, measurement of antibodies of the systemic immune system may not be a reliable indicator for local mucosal immunity. Due to the ease of sample collection, measurement of antibody in the saline extract of feces has been used to assess intestinal immune responses. However, the complicated components in the gastrointestinal tract may affect the measurement of antibodies in feces such as local antibody degradation by proteases and sialidases. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned methods cannot provide information about where in the intestinal tract the specific antibody response occurs. Such information has specific relevance for the development of control and prevention strategies against enteric pathogens.",

However, due to shortage of immunological reagents and methods specific for evaluation of turkey immunity, reports of intestinal mucosal immune responses in turkeys following exposure to TCV are limited. The antibodies to TCV in the intestine and bile were only qualitatively detected by immunodiffusion test (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1978) or a sandwich immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1980). The interactions between the kinetics and magnitudes of mucosal IgA antibody responses in turkeys and acute turkey coronaviral infection and subsequent recovery of affected turkeys from the infection are not completely understood. This study was undertaken to elucidate the kinetic and magnitudes of intestinal IgA antibody responses in turkey poults infected with TCV by intestinal segment cultures.",

Filtrates containing only TCV, but not other viruses, were examined by electron microscopy (EM) and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) according to procedures previously described (Dea and Garzon, 1991). For IEM, the turkey antisera specific for TCV was provided by Dr. Y.M. Saif (The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH) (Yu et al., 2000, Loa et al., 2001). Twenty-two days old embryonated turkey eggs were inoculated with 200 \u03bcl of the filtrate via amniotic sac route. Embryo intestines were harvested in 3 days. Harvested embryo intestines were processed and propagated serially as described above for five passages. Intestines of TCV-infected turkey embryos in the fifth passage were prepared as 20% suspension in PBS. The suspension was homogenized, clarified, filtered as described above, and used as inoculum. The inoculum was also examined with EM and IEM to confirm the presence of only TCV. The titer of virus was determined by inoculation of the suspension at 10-fold dilutions into groups of five 22-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. The 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50) was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938). An inoculum containing 4\u00d7103\n EID50/200 \u03bcl (Experiment 1) or 2\u00d7104\n EID50/1 ml (Experiment 2) of TCV was prepared and used to experimentally infect turkey poults.",

The virus-specific IgA antibody response seemed to decline faster in jejunum than in duodenum or ileum when the viral antigen is no longer detectable at 6 and 9 weeks PI. Given the much longer stretch of jejunum in comparison with duodenum or ileum in turkey, the faster decline of IgA response in jejunum may be due to random dispersion of virus-specific antibody secreting cells in a much wider jejunum.",

The activated B cells may enter the circulation and migrate to local and distant mucosal tissues as well as systemic lymphoid tissues. In the target environments, terminal differentiation of the activated B cells occurs and the virus-specific antibodies are produced.

A reliable method for the measurement of local mucosal immune responses is crucial for the evaluation of local immune response to infections and the development of mucosa-based vaccines.
