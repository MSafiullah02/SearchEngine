Although it is frequently mentioned that hundreds of different viruses can produce respiratory symptoms, this is due to the large number of picornavirus (>150) and adenovirus (>50) serotypes. Because there are small differences in clinical presentation between these serotypes, seven to eight types of agents can be described separately. The majority of them are ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (influenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] types A and B; parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4 viruses; human rhinoviruses [RVs]; human coronaviruses [HCVs] OC43 and 229E), including the newly identified NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses and the also recently identified human metapneumovirus (MPV).",

These \u201ccommon cold\u201d viruses belong to the picornavirus (small RNA) family, which also includes the enteroviruses, such as poliovirus, echovirus, and Coxsackie virus, and cardiovirus and aphthovirus. More than 100 RV serotypes have been identified and numbered. These are divided into major (90% of serotypes) and minor groups; the former use intercellular adhesion molecule-1 as their cellular receptor, whereas the latter use the low-density lipoprotein receptor. The epidemiology of RV-induced colds is closely related to social contact, and peaks are usually seen when children return to school after a vacation period. One of the most prominent roles of RV is in triggering asthma exacerbations.1 Comparative titrations of nasal, pharyngeal, and oral secretions have shown that replication is more active in the nose. However, studies comparing nasal and throat swabs with sputum samples obtained during asthma exacerbations showed that the viral isolation rate was higher in sputum, suggesting that RVs may also replicate in the lower airway. This was later clearly demonstrated with the use of molecular biology-based detection techniques.2 Although the severity of upper respiratory tract symptoms after RV infection does not differ between patients with asthma and normal subjects, both the duration and the severity of lower respiratory tract symptoms are more pronounced in patients with asthma.3 The lower respiratory tract epithelial cells infected by RVs are rich sources of inflammatory mediators that may trigger or propagate airway inflammation and obstruction.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus belongs to the Pneumovirinae subfamily and is a medium-sized (100\u2013300 nm) RNA virus. Variations in the attachment glycoprotein of the viral envelope give rise to the two antigenically distinct strains of RSV, A and B. Although there have been conflicting data, the majority of studies report that A strains are more common and produce more severe disease. A wide range of species can be experimentally infected with human RSV, but natural infection is species-specific. RSV enters the body through the eye or nose and, to a lesser extent, through the mouth. The virus subsequently spreads along the airway mucosa, mostly by cell-to-cell transfer along intracytoplasmic bridges, and also through aspiration from the upper to the lower airway. RSV follows a well-characterized epidemiologic pattern, with yearly outbreaks occurring between October and May in temperate climates. At least half of the infant population becomes infected during their first RSV epidemic, and almost all children have been infected by 2 years of age. Although infection usually leads to mild respiratory illness, some infants have more severe disease. Bronchiolitis is the characteristic clinical manifestation of such a complication. There is evidence that hospitalizations for bronchiolitis have considerably increased during recent decades and that hospitalized children have increased probability of wheezing later in life,4 with the immune status of the host probably playing an important role in the process.5 The relationship between RSV infection, atopy, subsequent symptoms, and the development of asthma is discussed in detail in Chapter 55.",

            "text": "Three types of influenza viruses, designated A, B, and C, and belonging to the orthomyxoviruses, have been identified. They are negative-stranded segmented RNA viruses. The two influenza envelope glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase determine both viral entry into target cells, by binding to sialic acids and fusing with cellular membrane elements, and the release of the virus. Infection with influenza virus occurs by inspiration of contaminated droplets from infected persons. Infected cells become round and swollen with pyknotic nuclei. Edema and polymorphonuclear infiltration are seen in the surrounding tissues. The progressive changes in epithelial cells suggest that infection starts in the trachea and then ascends or descends. The epidemiology of influenza viruses is characterized by yearly epidemics lasting for 6 to 8 weeks during late winter; each year, there is usually only one dominant type or subtype. Illnesses initially appear in children, whereas later in the epidemic, more adults are affected. Viruses are present in the community before and after the epidemic, causing illness at a low frequency. Antigenic variation readily occurs in H and N primary structures, giving rise to new subtypes (antigenic shift) and to intrasubtype changes (antigenic drift). Only type A influenza viruses have been associated with pandemics that have been occurring every 10 to 40 years. The last potentially pandemic strains to emerge were recorded in 1997 and 2003, and were of avian origin.6 The currently circulating type A human isolates are H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. The avian isolates were of H5N1 and H7N7 subtypes and were able to be transmitted to and infect humans7 by entering the cells through different cellular receptors.8\n",

Each PIV has distinct epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, as well as different age distribution patterns. PIV 1 and PIV 2, members of the Respirovirus genus, are generally associated with laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), upper respiratory tract illness, and pharyngitis, whereas PIV 3, a member of the Rubulavirus genus, is also a major cause of infant bronchiolitis and is associated with the development of pneumonia in susceptible subjects. PIV 4 is rare and less well studied. PIV 1 occurs in biennial epidemics during autumn, coinciding with croup outbreaks; its peak incidence occurs in children 2 to 3 years of age. PIV 2 epidemics are less predictable; however, they more or less follow the biennial pattern of PIV 1, affecting mostly children younger than 5 years of age. PIV 3 is unique among PIVs in its propensity to infect infants younger than 6 months of age in spring epidemics. PIV 3 infections are more frequent and occur yearly, with peaks seen during spring and summer. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to the host cell through interaction of the viral H and N glycoproteins with cellular sialic acid receptors, followed by uncoating of the virus, its translocation into the cytoplasm, and transcription, leading to replication. For transmission, aerosol spread is considered important, although deposition on surfaces and subsequent self-inoculation may also be relevant. Virus replication can occur throughout the tracheobronchial tree, causing local inflammation; however, only mild and rapidly repaired focal tissue destruction is observed in vivo. However, in immunocompromised hosts, fatal giant cell pneumonia may develop. Central to the pathogenesis of PIV infection is the ability of these viruses to escape interferon-mediated immune responses.9\n",

This large family of viruses includes six subgenera and more than 50 serotypes. Their overall size is 70 to 90 nm; the virion is naked and contains 36 to 38 kb double-stranded DNA, encoding more than 50 polypeptides from both strands. Some of these proteins allow efficient endosomal lysis and escape, leading to genome entrance into the host cell nucleus. The propensity of adenoviruses to shut off the expression of host messenger RNA and induce excess synthesis of adenoviral proteins leads to an accumulation of such proteins as intranuclear bodies, which are incompatible with normal cell function. In upper airway epithelial cells, ciliary and microtubular abnormalities lead to defective mucociliary clearance. An important feature of adenovirus is its ability to persist in the host for a long time, through low-grade replication, or for even longer periods, with production of adenoviral proteins without replication of a complete virus.",

The majority of HCVs studied to date are related to one of two reference strains, designated OC43 and 229E, which differ extensively. Recently, coronavirus NL63 was isolated from an infant with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis.10 It shares 65% sequence identity with 229E, but several prominent differences indicate that NL63 is a new group I coronavirus. Human aminopeptidase N, which is present on lung, intestinal, and kidney epithelial cells, has been identified as a receptor for HCV-229E. OC43 binds to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Viral replication has been demonstrated in the nasal mucosa, inducing inflammation, ciliary damage, and epithelial cell shedding. Its in vivo CPE is not pronounced, as in the case of RV infections. HCV replication in the lower airway has not been confirmed. Volunteers can be successfully infected by intranasal inoculation. HCV causes approximately 15% of common colds. The disease is generally mild, and there is evidence that HCV-induced colds may cause milder lower respiratory tract symptoms than other viruses. However, there have been reports of more severe lower respiratory tract involvement in young children and the elderly.",

In general, samples collected during the first days of symptoms lead to higher recovery rates of viruses. Upper respiratory samples include nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, with the former providing a lower rate of contamination by lower respiratory components. The swabs can then be placed in viral transport medium for further culture or can be used to prepare slides for immunofluorescent detection, either by rolling the swab directly on the slide or after recovery of cells by centrifugation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) are considered better sources for viral isolation than swabs. Although induced sputum is often contaminated by oropharyngeal components and microbial agents that hinder viral recovery, it is an easily obtainable sample, at least in older children, in whom the success rate is greater than 70%. Therefore, it is often used after either filtering through 200-nm membrane filters or dilution, usually in the presence of a reducing agent, such as 0.1% dithiothreitol, to reduce its viscosity. Transtracheal aspirates, bronchial biopsy specimens, and bronchial wash samples are all considered better sources than sputum for both culture and direct immunodetection of viruses in pelleted cells. Similarly, after centrifugation under mild conditions (10 min/500 \u00d7 g), both the supernatant and the pellet of bronchoalveolar lavage provide good sources for isolation and immunofluorescent detection of respiratory viruses. However, the invasiveness of these procedures precludes their routine use in children. A detailed description of this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter, and a variety of comprehensive articles are available within this textbook and elsewhere.",

If available, immunoprecipitation techniques can be used in such cases, and clumping, coating, or concentration of spherical structures is a prerequisite for a given sample to be characterized as positive.

Adenoviruses also resemble herpesviruses in appearance, and differentiation may be based on the larger size of the latter.

In competitive RIA methods, a known quantity of radioactivity-labeled antigen competes with unlabeled antigen that is added (test sample). The inhibition of binding of labeled antigen depends on the concentration of unlabeled antigen in the clinical sample. The labeled antigen that is finally bound to antibody is measured and referred to as bound antigen, whereas the unconjugated labeled antigen is referred to as free antigen. To circumvent problems arising from the separation of bound from free antigen in solid-phase RIA, the immunoreactant that is used first (antibody or antigen) is immobilized on a solid support. After each step, unwanted reactants can be removed readily by washing. In contrast to the laborious and expensive generation of labeled viral antigens, many of which are labile, noncompetitive RIA methods use labeled antibodies instead of viral antigens. The former are more stable, with more predictable structures and biochemical properties. Noncompetitive RIAs are, therefore, more popular in diagnostic virology. In a technique known as sandwich RIA, unlabeled viral antibodies adsorbed to a solid-phase support are allowed to capture viral antigens present in the clinical sample. Then a radiolabeled antibody (indicator antibody) is allowed to bind to the captured viral antigens. This procedure can be either direct or indirect. In the latter case, a primary unlabeled indicator antibody is used initially, followed by incubation with a secondary radiolabeled antibody. In all of these procedures, free antibody is removed after the final incubation and bound iodine-125-labeled antibody is measured.",

First, in IgG absorption methods, an IgG absorbent (e.g., staphylococcal protein A, streptococcal protein G) is incubated with the serum, and after a centrifugation step, so that IgM antibodies can be measured in the supernatant. These absorbents are believed to be superior to anti-human IgG antibodies for this method, because the latter may also remove some types of IgM. However, staphylococcal protein cannot bind IgG3, and this could interfere with the accuracy of the method because viral antibodies may be significantly represented in this subclass. Streptococcal protein G, on the other hand, binds all IgG subclasses, but not IgM; accordingly, combinations of streptococci and protein A have been used to remove all IgG and IgA from serum samples before IgM measurement. IgA can interfere with IgM measurement, resulting in false-negative findings by competing with IgM for antigenic sites. Second, in one of the early IgM separation methods, rate zonal centrifugation allowed purification of the IgM subclass based on its higher sedimentation coefficient compared with that of the other antibody classes. Gel filtration takes advantage of the higher molecular weight of IgM compared with the other classes (900 vs. 150\u2013400 kd). However, serum lipoproteins and nonspecific cell agglutinins may be fractionated, together with IgM, and could interfere with the assay. Ion-exchange chromatography, based on the differential binding of IgM and IgG classes to anion-exchange resins, has been used, but the IgM yield is relatively low, whereas IgG and IgA may still be present in the IgM fraction after elution from the column. Third, in the popular IgM immunoassays, anti-human IgM-specific antibodies are employed. Indirect immunofluorescence and EIA are the methods typically used for IgM detection. Capture IgM assays show reduced nonspecific binding; in this method, solid-phase, fixed anti-human IgM antibodies separate IgM after incubation with the serum sample. The potential presence of antiviral elements is further detected using labeled viral antigen or unlabeled antigen, followed by a labeled antigen-specific antibody. Detection of antiparainfluenza IgM has been also reported with the use of hemadsorption.",

Complement fixation antibodies can be raised against some or all viral proteins. Their titers increase slowly during primary infection, reaching lower levels than antibody titers detected by the other methods. In addition, they decline gradually, making this method less sensitive than others for the detection of viral infection. An additional problem is the interference of some serum elements (heparin, IgG aggregates) with complement formation. In a typical complement fixation assay, the serum sample is incubated with a particular antigen in the presence of a known amount of guinea pig complement. If a specific antibody is present in the serum, the complement will be bound and depleted from the solution.

Hemolysis inhibition assays take advantage of these properties to measure the presence of antibodies in a serum sample that bind and block viral antigens and inhibit hemolysis. In this way, the hemolysis inhibition assay detects both antihemagglutinin and antifusion antibodies in the serum. In a typical protocol, serum dilutions are mixed and incubated with purified virus. A 10% suspension of suitable erythrocytes is then added. After some hours of incubation, the erythrocytes are removed by centrifugation and the optical density of the \u201ccleared\u201d supernatant is read with a spectrophotometer. A classic endpoint titer can then be calculated by defining the highest serum dilution that causes 50% inhibition of hemolysis.",

Because the majority of respiratory viruses are single-stranded RNA, these viruses are believed to be suitable for detection with hybridization techniques. In this approach, a suitable oligonucleotide probe sharing a certain degree of homology that allows base pair matching with the single-stranded viral nucleic acid is allowed to anneal under stringent reaction conditions (hybridization). Whereas single-stranded RNA viruses provide ready-made, yet labile, genetic material, the double-stranded DNA content of adenovirus must first be denatured or dissociated by chemical (e.g., sodium hydroxide) or physical (heat) means. The resulting single-stranded DNA would return to its double-stranded configuration on removal of the dissociation agent. The probe can be labeled directly with enzymes or other reporter molecules; alternatively, linker moieties, such as biotin or digoxigenin, can be attached to probes and serve as bridges for the attachment of reporter molecules. Digoxigenin-labeled probes are believed to be more sensitive for in situ hybridization than those using the biotin-streptavidin system. In a typical protocol, the viral nucleic acid is isolated, purified, denatured, and bound to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. The probe, denatured and labeled, is incubated with the viral nucleic acid, under carefully defined conditions, and unbound material is thoroughly washed out. A reporter molecule is then added (e.g., alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin), and after a second incubation period, the unbound reporter is washed out and the final chromogen or other suitable substrate is added to give rise to a measurable signal.",

They have become a common practice in detection protocols during the last few years. This section discusses recent innovations in the field, but does not describe PCR basics in detail. Many existing handbooks describe this method. The majority of respiratory viruses are RNA viruses; therefore, reverse transcription PCR is required for their detection in clinical samples. First, total RNA is extracted from NPA samples or throat swabs by standard molecular biologic techniques. The samples should be kept at \u221270\u00b0C to avoid deterioration of the genetic material. A good practice is to store samples at \u221270\u00b0C in an appropriate virus transport medium (e.g., Hank's balanced salt solution enriched with 0.5% bovine serum albumin). If throat swabs are the source, they can be placed directly into a denaturing solution to inactivate ribonuclease enzyme activity, and then stored or transported at room temperature. Extracted RNA is then reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA; e.g., with reverse transcriptase isolated from a retrovirus, such as murine MoMuLV) and further amplified by PCR using virus-specific oligonucleotides (primers) that have been designed with the aid of computer software. These primers are usually planned to amplify sequences that are 100 to 1000 base pairs long (amplicons), and can be designed so that they discriminate between different serotypes of the same virus. Nucleotide diversity that is frequently observed among different strains of a given virus species should also be taken into account, and areas of high homology should be selected for serotype-specific primer pairs design. The amplicons can then be electrophoresed in a 1% to 2.5% agarose gel and visualized as DNA bands under an ultraviolet transilluminator after they are stained with ethidium bromide or another DNA dye. This is readily accomplished within 1 working day, a fact that is of particular importance for the clinical diagnostic laboratory.",

Alternatively, reverse transcriptase PCR can be combined with EIA techniques, consisting of hybridization of the amplicon with biotinylated RNA probes directed against the internal sequences of the amplicon. Time-resolved fluorometry has also been combined with PCR for the detection of picornaviruses.29 PCR amplicons can also be used as a source for a second round of PCR in the \u201cnested\u201d PCR that usually shows increased sensitivity. In this approach, a second set of primers is designed against sequences that were localized internally in the sequences that were amplified in the first round. The method can be so sensitive as to detect a few particles of respiratory virus.30 Nested-type PCR not only may increase sensitivity, but also may discriminate between serotypes within viral species that are of similar size and thus are difficult to separate with gel from the first round of PCR. Discrimination within or between species can be also accomplished by digesting the amplicons with restriction endonucleases. Human RVs, for instance, can be discriminated from enteroviruses based on the specific pattern produced after digestion of the PCR product with BglI restriction endonuclease.31 Enteroviruses lack a BglI recognition site in their respective amplified sequence. Thus, their product remains undigested, retaining its original size (Fig. 22-3\n).",

There are many such examples in the literature; the formulation of Hexaplex (Prodesse, Waukesha, Wisconsin), for instance, allows the detection of H1N1, H3N2, influenza A, influenza B, both RSV subtypes, and three of the four human parainfluenzas.32 This multiplex PCR has been tested in clinical samples and seems to achieve high rates of sensitivity and specificity. In addition, this highly sensitive and rapid type of test not only allows simultaneous detection of many viruses, providing obvious advantages for clinical practice, but also may reveal the presence of virus in samples with few viral copies or the presence of viral RNA without live virus, both of which may be missed with conventional cell culture techniques. The detection limits of multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR protocols allow the identification of as few as 100 to 140 copies of virus/mL, or one TCID50. This method can be at least as sensitive as combined tissue culture and immunofluorescence methods. Combination with hybridization may further improve detection scores. In a combination of multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR and enzyme hybridization assay, the amplicons of seven respiratory viruses (RSV A and B, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1\u20133 viruses) were purified and hybridized with peroxidase-labeled probes into avidin-coated, 96-well microplates. The signal emitted after incubation of the complex with the substrate allowed the detection of almost twice as many positive clinical samples compared with conventional culture and indirect immunofluorescence methods.33 The performance of multiplex PCR assays may vary, depending on the virus tested. For instance, a multiplex PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that can detect seven respiratory viruses, in addition to the common respiratory pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, although it proved to be more sensitive than cell culture in detecting parainfluenza 3 virus, adenovirus, and influenza virus, was less efficient (by at least a factor of 10) in revealing RSV and parainfluenza 1 virus. Recent developments in this method include primers specific for additional viral and bacterial species (e.g., Reovirus, Bordetella pertussis), allowing for the detection of as many as 19 different microorganisms in a clinical sample.34 Finally, multiplex PCR assays have been designed to discriminate between multiple subtypes within one species, as is the case with adenoviruses and picornaviruses.35,\n36 In another approach, degenerate primers have been used to discriminate between adenovirus serotypes.37\n",

This method, however, was not designed to discriminate between A and B subtypes of RSV. Limitations in the number of viruses and viral serotypes are inherent in the real-time approach, especially in the protocols using a labeled probe, because most platforms do not allow the simultaneous use of more than two fluorochromes. Using a more advanced apparatus that can detect up to four fluorochromes, Templeton and colleagues45 succeeded in detecting both influenza serotypes, RSV, and all four parainfluenza subtypes in a two-tube reaction. In their approach, the specific probes were labeled with different fluorochromes (i.e., 6-carboxyfluoroscein, Texas red, hexachlorofluoroscein, and cyanin 5); the overall reaction could be accomplished within 6 hours and proved to be more sensitive than cell culture in detecting these seven respiratory viruses in clinical samples. The detection limits ranged from 0.1 to 0.0001 TCID50 of viral stocks of known titer, depending on the virus.",

Using an ink-jet oligonucleotide synthesizer, these oligonucleotides are synthesized in situ and placed onto directed locations of a glass wafer.49 The glass surfaces can then be hybridized, under strict conditions, with cDNA, PCR amplicons, RNA, or another form of genetic material derived from viral stocks, virally infected cells in cultures, or clinical samples. Human and cellular transcripts are also included to normalize against nonspecific hybridization. This material is labeled with cyanin 5 or cyanin 3, which provides red or green coloring, respectively, to allow color visualization of microarray data that are obtained after the arrays are scanned with confocal laser scanners and analyzed with suitable instrumentation and software. This method allows the detection of paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, adenoviruses, and picornaviruses from clinical samples. It can also detect and discriminate among all 102 RV serotypes, based on the hybridization pattern obtained from each serotype. After human volunteers were experimentally infected with RV, the array could detect as few as 100 infectious RV particles in NPA samples.48 Analysis of a small number of samples from naturally acquired colds showed different RV serotypes and parainfluenza 1 virus, which has also been confirmed by conventional reverse transcriptase PCR. Although it is extremely promising, this technique needs further evaluation, including cost-effectiveness, before being applied in clinical practice.",

The identification of a particular virus can be further, and without doubt, confirmed by restriction analysis or sequencing of the product and further comparison with published genome databases. In addition, the PCR-based methods have proved to be very sensitive, usually exceeding the sensitivity scores of cell culture techniques. However, false-positive or false-negative findings can be a problem with these methods, if certain prac-tical measures in the handling of viral genetic material are not meticulously followed. First, preservation of the sample is of particular importance for the integrity of the viral genomic material. RNA, the genomic material of most respiratory viruses, is particularly vulnerable to degradation by ribonucleases that are present in all biologic samples and fluids. Ribonuclease-free vials, solutions, and buffers should be used in designated areas of the laboratory, and all material should be used by specialized personnel. In addition, if it takes too long for an NPA sample to be transported from the clinic to the laboratory, or if the sample remains on ice for too many hours instead of being placed in the freezer immediately, the sensitivity of the method, even that of a PCR-based protocol, can be unexpectedly low. Further, biologic fluids often contain substances that can inhibit PCR amplification (e.g., mucus). In this case, dilution of the sample or treatment with a suitable agent (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide) may facilitate detection of the virus. The use of clinical samples spiked with stock virus or the inclusion of synthetic heterologous competitor RNA in the reaction may facilitate normalization of PCR outcomes.",

In addition, threatening influenza pandemics and mortal epidemics of previously unknown respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV, require the use of rapid and reliable detection methods in clinical practice. Moreover, large epidemiologic studies are required to better define the involvement of these viruses in noninfectious diseases, such as asthma, in the short and long term. This analysis will help in drug development and the implementation of intervention strategies, even during an outbreak. Because many respiratory symptoms are common among these viruses, clinical examination does not determine the etiology of particular cases. On the other hand, drugs are being developed that specifically block infection by individual viruses (i.e., anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitors), but they are useless if the patient has been infected by another virus. Thus, all of these methods are of major and increasing importance and use in clinical practice. It is not possible to determine which is the optimal method for virus detection because many parameters vary, depending on the particular conditions and the scope of the analysis (cost-effectiveness, time required, sensitivity, availability of skilled personnel and laboratory equipment). It is a combination of methods, rather than a single one, that is practically used in particular cases because most protocols are not ideal. Even electron microscopy is still recognized as an indispensable method in some cases.50 Although cell culture remains the gold standard, it is time consuming and tends to be replaced by antigen-detecting methods and molecular biologic techniques. Their commercial availability, ease of performance, and rapidity have made the newly developed antigen-based methods increasingly popular. Actually, these tests tend to be preferred in routine analysis, especially in small units lacking advanced facilities. They can be accomplished within 15 minutes to a few hours. However, they can be inferior to cell culture in terms of sensitivity,51 and are of limited value for the detection of some respiratory viruses, such as RSV, in older population groups.52\nOn the other hand, PCR has been widely used as a research tool during the last decade, and its clinical use is steadily increasing. PCR cannot, however, replace the use of cell culture in worldwide influenza surveillance, an aspect of classic virology that is vital for informing vaccine constituents.53\n",
