Some \u2018relics\u2019 of this RNA world [1] period remain as a handful of catalytic and evolutionarily conserved RNAs, and RNA viruses 2, 3, 4. The most spectacular is the ribosome with a core of RNAs necessary, and perhaps sufficient, for protein synthesis 5, 6, 7. DNA synthesis is not carried out by any such RNA machine, but traces of an RNA world origin are nevertheless evident 8, 9. DNA synthesis cannot proceed without an RNA primer [2], and that deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised from ribonucleotides (by ribonucleotide reductases) also argues for the evolutionary transition from RNA to DNA [10].",

On the basis of structure [11] and suggested sequence homology 12, 13 all three classes appear to share a common origin. All require complex protein radical chemistry to reduce ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, though the radical generation mechanism differs between the classes (Figure 1) 10, 14. The highly complex nature of the reduction suggests that catalytic proteins had to arise before the transition to DNA could occur. Catalytic RNA (ribozymes), almost certainly could not have carried out such free radical chemistry \u2013 even if a radical could have been generated it is unlikely it could have been controlled (Table 1) 4, 15. A salient example of this is the use of radicals in probing of nucleic acid structure. Fe(II)\u2013EDTA generated radicals cleave RNA and DNA non-specifically, regardless of whether single-stranded or double-stranded, and irrespective of local structure [15]. While class II and III reductases use nucleotide cofactors, this does not mean that the reactions would have occurred in the RNA world, though these cofactors may date from the RNA world. It is the cofactors themselves [16], not the diversity of reactions they are involved in, that date back to the RNA world \u2013 they have been recruited into many new metabolic pathways during evolution. Given known RNA chemistry, ribonucleotide reduction appears impossible until the development of protein catalysts.",

In all three cases the enzyme is large (radical storage/handling requires this) and radical generation is separate from catalysis (Figure 1) \u2013 the radical must be contained in the absence of substrate and directed specifically to the ribose 2\u2032-hydroxyl during catalysis. Such a complex reaction was almost certainly not carried out by the first catalytic proteins, which probably tackled less complex reactions.

A similar argument for an intermediate stage has been used for the origins of the RNA world itself. On current knowledge of prebiotic chemistry, \u03b2-D-ribose was not readily produced on the early Earth and this has led [34] to a search for intermediate genetic materials that might have preceded RNA. Nelson et al. [35] suggest PNA (peptide nucleic acid) as a candidate first genetic material. Though there is no evidence for PNA having ever been a biologically relevant molecule, searching for intermediates in the origin of life can aid in uncovering simpler solutions to the problem. In the current case, we approach the question of the origins of DNA within the framework of the accepted model for the RNA world, and in doing so we identify a number of problems with this model in understanding the origin of DNA. We suggest that adding an extra step is currently the simplest way [33] of treating the problem, and it leads to potential experimental tests.",

This may also have been the case for other RNAs, so snoRNA-mediated post-transcriptional methylation could have been of global selective advantage. A recent report describes two C/D box snoRNAs that guide 2\u2032-O-methylation of U6 snRNA [38] \u2013 one of these also directs methylation of 28S rRNA. We take this as support that methylation could have been widespread in the RNA world.

The large diversity of snoRNAs found in modern eukaryotes may thus have arisen later in evolution [36].

While only the latter acts on the 2\u2032-hydroxyl of ribose, both are instructive in trying to understand the possible mechanism of this reaction. Biochemical studies of catechol-O-methyltransferase reveal that the methyl group is almost certainly transferred directly from AdoMet to the oxygen by an SN2 mechanism, with no methylated enzyme intermediate [42]. Positive charges (Lys-144, Mg2+, and S+ of AdoMet) close to the hydroxyl are predicted to promote leaving of the hydrogen, upon which the oxygen would make a nucleophilic attack on the reactive H3C\u2013S+ bond on AdoMet (Figure 3A), producing S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine 40, 42. The data for VP39 [41] likewise suggest the reaction is coaxed along simply by the coordination of positively charged residues in the vicinity of the 2\u2032-hydroxyl.",

A crucial point is that the methylase could recognise dsRNA in a non-specific manner, allowing it to act on the, presumably, dsRNA of the genome. This amounts to recruitment from RNA post-transcriptional methylation into RNA post-replicative methylation. In this model, no snoRNAs are required for genome methylation, and because the position of methylation is less crucial than for functional RNA, methylation at many points on the genome would be advantageous (Figure 3B). In contrast, non-specific methylations of functional RNAs could result in silencing of residues crucial for catalysis and loss of function [46].",

Certainly it seems improbable that the methylase reached the level of processivity of RNA polymerases. Complete methylation may in fact be a hindrance, since a hydrophobic \u2018cushion\u2019 would form in the deep groove of the RNA 47, 48. Indeed the partially purified 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase shows preference for unmethylated RNA over methylated RNA [51], and increased hydrophobicity might be one explanation for this. Lastly, incomplete, non-specific methylation would have its drawbacks, in that there would be no means of repeatedly methylating the most susceptible sites. The evolution of ribonucleotide reduction would solve these problems (Table 2): complete pre-replicative modification of the 2\u2032-OH is possible; deep groove hydrophobicity is avoided; B form DNA (where bases are buried in the centre of the double helix) may be less likely to suffer base damage than unmethylated or partially methylated duplex RNA.",

Methylating snoRNAs have been detected in Archaea [37] so the fibrillarin structure is particularly relevant to our hypothesis.

A simplified scheme summarising the chemistry of ribonucleotide reduction for each of the three classes of ribonucleotide reductase. In the first step, a radical is generated at some distance from the active site. In class I and III, radical generation and catalysis occur on different subunits. The class I reductases produce a stable tyrosine radical with the help of an iron-oxygen centre, and this is transferred to the active site, 30\u201340 \u00c5 away. In classes II and III, a nucleotide cofactor (adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and AdoMet, respectively) is cleaved to generate a deoxyadenosyl radical (AdoCH2\u2022), which subsequently forms a stable glycine radical in the class III reductase. In the next step the radical in all three classes is transferred to an active site cysteine, forming a thiyl radical. This is then transferred to the 3\u2032 position of the ribose, and two cysteines act as reductants in classes I and II, while formate is the reductant in the class III reaction. Once the 2\u2032-OH has been reduced to 2\u2032-H, with regeneration of the thiyl radical, this is transferred back to the tyrosine in class I, to the glycine in class III, while in class II AdoCbl is regenerated. In the class III reaction, AdoMet is consumed in generating the glycine radical, but like the tyrosine radical in the class I reaction, the glycine radical is stable and can presumably support several enzymatic turn-over cycles.",

The difference between RNA, 2\u2032-O-methylated RNA and DNA is the nature of the group at the 2\u2032 position of the ribose (highlighted in red). In RNA the 2\u2032 position carries a hydroxyl. The reactivity of this group is a major determinant of RNA catalytic activity. 2\u2032-O-Methyl RNA occurs extensively on eukaryotic and archaeal RNAs, particularly ribosomal RNA, where the reaction is snoRNA-mediated. Site-specific protein methylases catalyse the rRNA methylation in bacteria. Methylation eliminates the propensity for 2\u2032-OH-mediated catalytic activity. In DNA, hydrogen is at the 2\u2032 position on the ribose. Ribonucleotide reductases utilise free radical chemistry to reduce the 2\u2032-OH of free ribonucleotides to a 2\u2032-H, forming free deoxyribonucleotides. Bases are shown in blue: uracil in RNA and 2\u2032-O-methyl RNA and thymine in DNA.",

Methylation on hydroxyl oxygen may require AdoMet as methyl group donor, a means of bringing the 2\u2032-hydroxyl and methyl moieties into close contact, and positive charges to facilitate leaving of the hydrogen (see text). The role of the protein enzyme may be simply to augment methylation rather than being directly involved in the catalytic step. (B) SnoRNA-dependent modification of pre-rRNA dates back to the RNA world. As in the modern system, methylation may originally have occurred concurrent with transcription. With the advent of protein synthesis very simple catalysts arose, among these a non-specific dsRNA methylase. The methylase interacted with snoRNAs, being guided or tethered by these to specific sites on the pre-rRNA. The expectation is that this methylase has been retained in the modern eukaryotes and archaea but lost from bacteria. By virtue of its non-specific dsRNA methylating activity, this enzyme is hypothesised to have been recruited into methylation of genomic RNA, improving the stability of the genetic material prior to the origin of DNA. Methylation may initially have been carried out by a ribozyme that associated with each of the methylating snoRNAs, or alternatively methylation could have been carried out by the snoRNAs themselves.

The events leading to the origin of DNA can be broken down into a number of steps, with selection acting at each step. This Darwinian approach to understanding complex systems can be further understood in terms of the Eigen limit (see text). In the case of genome evolution, it can be described in terms of a positive-feedback cycle: (1) Each newly selected function permits a greater potential coding capacity. (2) In turn, this permits new functions to arise. (3) These functions are selected for, thus permitting a greater potential coding capacity, and so the process is a positive feedback cycle (This we call the Darwin\u2013Eigen cycle [9], depicted schematically in pink). Our model cannot determine whether the RNA polymerase arose before the dsRNA methylase or vice versa; we consider both to be essential steps in the origin of DNA, irrespective of order.
