In some studies, vitamin D inadequacy was held responsible for the increase in asthma.1 In one study, low vitamin D intake during pregnancy has been shown to increase recurrent wheezing around five years of age.2 In another study, patients who received daily 2000 IU vitamin D regularly in their first year were found to have a higher risk of developing asthma compared to the group without vitamin D when they were 31 years of age.3 As seen in different studies, different results were found between the intake of vitamin D and the development of asthma. Larger and randomized studies are needed to clarify this issue.",

In a recent meta-analysis rhinovirus induced wheezing in the first three years of life was found to be related with subsequent development of wheezing/asthma.9\n",

Table 5\nshows the comparison of the levels of vitamin D with the factors that may indicate the severity of the wheezing attack. There was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between hospitalized and not hospitalized patients and who received and did not receive oxygen and steroid treatment during the wheezing attack (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between oxygen saturation and vitamin D levels in wheezing attack (r = 0,062; p = 0.665).",
