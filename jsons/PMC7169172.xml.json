Strains endemic to the human population include 229E, HKU, NL63, and OC43 (Chan et al., 2015), which circulate continuously among children and adults worldwide with infection trends typified by seasonality and mild symptoms in healthy individuals. The new millennium, however, has marked the emergence via zoonosis of two highly virulent CoV strains novel to the human population. In 2003, a novel CoV emerged in the Guangdong Province of China that caused a new and deadly outbreak of respiratory disease in humans termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV). Within months, SARS\u2010CoV spread rapidly to 25 countries (in part due to the modern, highly globalized nature of air travel), with thousands sickened and close to 800 fatal cases (Hilgenfeld & Peiris, 2013). Investigation of the origin of SARS\u2010CoV led first to the exotic animal markets of China and the initial implication of palm civet cats and raccoon dogs (which were found to be intermediate hosts), with further study indicating bats as the true natural reservoir of SARS\u2010like CoVs (Han et al., 2015). In April 2012, an outbreak of severe respiratory viral illnesses localized in several intensive care units occurred in the Middle Eastern country of Jordan; both patients and healthcare workers were infected. Within several months, cases had also surfaced in several nearby Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with rapid movement into 20 additional countries in North Africa and Europe (Al\u2010Tawfiq, 2013; Breban, Riou, & Fontanet, 2013). Early indications pointed to a highly virulent infectious agent, as a high percentage of patients were dying, particularly those with comorbidities. A novel strain of CoV was soon isolated and named after the region of origin in conjunction with the primary manifestation of symptoms\u2014Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS\u2010CoV) (de Groot et al., 2013).",

There are currently no human vaccines available to counter infection with MERS\u2010CoV, while veterinary vaccines for camels are currently under developments (Widagdo, Okba, Stalin Raj, & Haagmans, 2017). Therefore, to date, containment of infectious viruses via personal hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation of MERS symptomatic persons, and quarantine of potentially exposed individuals to prevent contact with others is recommended (CDC, 2017a, 2017b). The published literature on MERS has consistently estimated a reproductive number (R\n0; the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case) of <1, suggesting that MERS\u2010CoV does not yet pose a pandemic risk (Breban et al., 2013; Nishiura, Miyamatsu, Chowell, & Saitoh, 2015; Poletto, Pelat, L\u00e9vy\u2010Bruhl, Boelle, & Colizza, 2016; World Health Organization, 2018). In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 82 of 168 clinical samples stemmed from a single hospital, and phylogenetic analyses of seven confirmed MERS\u2010CoV isolates from those cases were found to cluster in a single monophyletic clade (Drosten et al., 2015).",

Mean incubation period for the virus has been reported to range from 2 to 15 days, with a median value of five days (Banik, Khandaker, & Rashid, 2015). MERS\u2010CoV infection results in fever, cough sore throat, headache, and occasionally results in nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In more severe cases, patients may experience shortness of breath, pneumonia, and death (Banik et al., 2015). In the South Korean outbreak, the morbidity rate was estimated to be 1.08% (Ki, 2015). The patient mortality rate has been reported to vary greatly depending on the age and underlying conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and chronic lung disease. In the South Korean outbreak, the overall mortality rate was reported to be 19.4%. MERS infected persons who were already hospitalized for other medical conditions had a higher mortality rate (33.8%) than the persons without prior medical conditions (9.2%). Similarly, patients over 60 years of age had a higher mortality rate (38.1%) than younger patients (6.4%) (Ki, 2015).",

The visitation of a single index patient to five different hospitals is believed to have resulted in 185 downstream nosocomial cases of MERS\u2010CoV (Cowling et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015; World Health Organization, 2015), although confirmatory phylogenetic analyses have not yet been performed. Unlike the previously documented case clusters, the South Korean outbreak was well documented with regard to incubation time, transmission chains (i.e., 28 first\u2010generation cases, 125 second\u2010generation cases, and 32 third\u2010generation cases), and contact tracing of infected patients (Ki, 2015). The majority of infections were hospital\u2010acquired; only one of the 186 patients in the South Korean cluster was believed to be infected outside of a hospital, and two other individuals were infected by modes of transmission that are currently unknown (Ki, 2015).",

On contrast, studies suggested that the main transmission route of MERS was via the airborne route, especially over close contact airborne exposure (Xia et al., 2014). Hence, isolation of index patient in a negative\u2010pressure room and quarantine of potentially exposed persons are considered key risk management measures for literature that investigated the South Korean MERS outbreak (Cowling et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Park et al., 2017; Park et al., 2016; World Health Organization, 2015). In consequence, isolation and quarantine would be measures that would drastically lower the risk of MERS infection once patients are identified. From previous outbreaks, the index patient stays unidentified as a MERS carrier for up to two days (Cho et al., 2016). Additionally, the time for identifying MERS from a diagnostic laboratory in a patient takes up to three days (Cowling et al., 2015), so probable exposure durations around two to three days are relevant scenarios to model.",

The parameter values were selected from multiple sources including the latest reported large outbreak that occurred in South Korea, and data from other sources. Risk of infection is estimated for four types of at\u2010risk populations: nurses and healthcare workers visiting the index patient (before the patient was identified as carrying MERS) and other patients sharing the same room; family visitors coming to visit the index patient; and the other patients sharing the same room (Cho et al., 2016). Risk estimation is conducted by using the Monte Carlo simulation method to incorporate uncertainty and variability in the risk characterization. Sensitivity of the model parameters is assessed to determine where additional data or knowledge could potentially reduce uncertainty and increase our understanding of these risks. Finally, the effectiveness of mask and increased ventilation risk management measures is evaluated. Rather than a retrospective case analysis, the study is intended to contribute a framework for analyzing current and future MERS risk in similar settings.",

For the present assessment scenario, only the risk of infection from aerosolized particles and droplets expelled by coughing was considered. The influence of nebulizer treatments that can be done on the index patient was considered negligible and not included in the model. Although the contribution of this treatment was suggested by Park et al. (2016), studies have also demonstrated that nebulizers do not specifically impact transmission (Seto, 2015; Thompson et al., 2013). Fomites may also serve as a potential reservoir for MERS\u2010CoV due to the settling of aerosols after release from infected persons. However, some studies stated that fomite\u2010based exposure pathways were not significant compared to airborne routes, and so it was not considered in this study (Xiao, Li, Sung, Wei, & Yang, 2018).",

            "text": "Aerosol transport modeling was undertaken to assess virus inputs from coughing and removal via settling onto surfaces and the air exchange processes (i.e., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning [HVAC] systems). The model room system was assumed to have reached steady state, meaning that there is no accumulation or loss from the system over time, and that the input flow rates must equal the removal flow rates. This input\u2013output relationship is shown in Equation (1):\n(1)N in , coughing =N out , setting +N out , ventilation +N inhalation ,where N is the number of droplets containing viruses. In Equation (1), N\n(inhalation) or the number of viruses removed through inhalation by infected or uninfected persons (patients in the same room, health care workers, and visitors) was assumed to be nonsignificant as compared to the other two terms, N( out , settling ) and N( out , ventilation ), and thus was neglected as a sink. Expiratory events (i.e., coughing) produces a broad distribution of aerosol particles, however, this analysis was only concerned with aerosols that were likely to be inspirable and respirable. Aerosol production values were taken from Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010) and the references therein. Particles with a diameter of <10 \u00b5m were considered as respirable aerosols. Respirable aerosols are expected to be easily transported, due to their small diameter, and thus represent a potential exposure pathway for people that are farther away from the source (e.g., more than 1\u20132 m from the source). Thus, respirable particles were the only evaluated exposure pathway for patients sharing a room with an infected symptomatic patient. Aerosols with a diameter of 10\u2013100 \u00b5m were considered as inspirable aerosols as these large particles are not expected to be transported long distances and are only relevant for persons in close contact. Nurses, healthcare workers, and visitors were assumed to be exposed to both respirable and inspirable aerosols. Viral release into the room was calculated using Equation (2):\n(2)Vi=\u03c0di26\u00d710\u221212,where Vi (mL) is the volume for each droplet size di that are released into the room as inspirable or respirable droplets during each coughing event. Each cough produced Ni number of droplets of size di, where each droplet is assumed to be spherical, and the droplet volume is calculated as 16\u00d7\u03c0\u00d7di3, where di is the diameter (\u00b5m).

Postevaporation particle transport was evaluated, accounting for two removal mechanisms: droplet settling and ventilation\u2010based droplet removal. Stoke's law was used to calculate droplet terminal settling velocity vi( terminal ) (m/hr) (Equation (3)), which was assumed to be impacted only by particle diameter di (Nicas, Nazaroff, & Hubbard, 2005).(3)vi terminal =0.108\u00d7di2\u00d71+0.166di.Terminal settling velocities were calculated for each of the representative particle sizes, di. A critical settling velocity, v\n(critical) (m/hr), was calculated as the required settling velocity to fall from the height of the patient bed h\n(cough) (m) during the air residence time \u03c4 (hour) (Equation (4)). Air residence time, \u03c4, is the average amount of time that a \u201cparcel\u201d of air is in the room, which depends on the volume of the room v\n(room) and the ventilation rate q\n(ventilation).\n(4)\u03c4=v room q ventilation ,\n(5)v critical =h cough \u03c4.Ventilation flow rate q\n(ventilation) was quantified by the number of air exchanges per hour (ACH) of the room volume, which was defined as shown in Equation (6):\n(6)q ventilation =V room \u00d7ACH,where V\n(room) is the volume of the hospital room (m3) and q\n(exchange) is the air flow rate (m3/hr) determined by the number of ACH v\n(exchange). As stated previously, height of the patient bed, h\n(cough), was 1 m. For particles that had a terminal settling velocity greater than the critical velocity (vi( terminal )>v( critical )), it was assumed that settling was a viable removal mechanism. It was further assumed that droplets that hit the floor were permanently removed from the system with no resuspension. This acknowledges that all the settleable aerosol droplets settled to the floor in a time interval less than \u03c4. However, due to the continuous generation, there were some fractions of the settleable droplets that were not yet settled. At a given time, for the droplets with terminal velocity greater than the critical velocity (vi( terminal )>v( critical )), it was assumed that the aerosol concentration of settleable droplets was proportional to the ratio of settling velocities, as shown in Equation (7). For the droplets that had terminal settling velocities less than the critical settling velocity (vi( terminal )\u2264v( critical )), it was assumed that there was no droplet removal via settling.\n(7)Ni room , settleable =Ni in , cough \u00d7v critical vi terminal .For these later particles, it was assumed that air currents in the room dictated their transport. However, this transport and homogeneous mixing did not include settling onto another surface resulting in removal (i.e., striking a piece of furniture, or a wall) and was considered entirely an elastic collision. Airborne particles were assumed to be homogeneously distributed within the volume of the room. Hence, the number of droplets containing viruses removed through settling for each droplet i is:\n(8)Ni out , settling =Ni in , cough \u00d71\u2212v critical vi terminal .Air exchanges via ventilation was also considered a removal mechanism, in which air, including the homogeneously mixed virus\u2010containing aerosol droplets, was removed from the hospital room and replaced with new air. It was assumed that the replacement air contained no viruses. During each air replacement, all the remaining droplets were assumed to be removed by the ventilation, which implies the relationship in Equation (9).\n(9)Ni out , ventilation =Ni in , cough \u2212Ni out , settling .It was assumed that Ni( out , ventilation ), number of droplets remaining after settling, are suspended in the room until they are removed by ventilation. Hence, the concentration of saliva in the air produced by a single cough per unit volume of room air is calculated as\n(10)C saliva  in  air =\u2211i=1nNiViV room ,where C( saliva  in  air ) is the concentration of saliva in the room air produced by a single cough per hour (mL/m3), Vi is the volume of each droplet calculated using Equation (2), and V\n(room) is the room volume.",

The number of cough events per hour was modeled based on Loudon and Brown (1967), using the estimates for the number of cough events in nonsmokers with pneumonia. Based on Nicas and Jones (2009), we assumed that 0.044 mL of saliva was emitted per cough, which represents the most conservative estimate compared to other published volumes in the literature (Duguid, 1946; Loudon & Brown, 1967; Papineni & Rosenthal, 1997). Saliva volume was assumed to have a uniform distribution with a \u00b110% of the reported value. Of the expired fluid, 0.00015% was considered respirable and 0.54% was considered inspirable. In other words, about 99.45% of the volume expired during each cough was considered to be nonrespirable and noninspirable, and therefore was not included in this analysis. Respirable droplets were modeled as aerosols with mean postevaporation diameters of 4 \u00b5m and 8 \u00b5m (for small and large respirable droplets), which Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010) estimated were produced at a rate of 160 and 7.5 droplets per coughing event, respectively. Similarly, based on Stilianakis and Drossinos (2010), representative inspirable droplets corresponded to aerosols with mean postevaporation diameters of 7.3 \u00b5m and 74 \u00b5m diameter droplets (corresponding to inhalable aerosols), which were produced at 41.47 and 138.48 droplets per cough, respectively. Other than this initial evaporation, it is assumed that the aerosol droplets did not change in size, including that neither further evaporation nor particle aggregation occurred. Uncertainty in the droplet production numbers was investigated by holding the number of particles constant, and using bootstrap iterations to compare the uncertainty in the relative number of particles for each of the four respective representative particle sizes. The results of the bootstrap uncertainty analysis were used to model particle production as a stochastic input.",

Therefore, the SARS dose\u2013response model (Huang, 2013) was employed as a surrogate. MERS has several similarities to SARS: both have an animal origin and appeared around 2002 in approximately the same regions\u2014Asia and Middle East (Sutton & Subbarao, 2015), both are respiratory CoVs with the same transmission route, both have a comparable protein structure for binding to host cells (Lu, Wang, & Gao, 2015), and both have reported similar tropism within cells (Zhou, Chu, Chan, & Yuen, 2015). Hence, despite probable differences in attack rates and mortality rates between the two viruses (Chan et al., 2015), it was assumed in this study that the SARS dose\u2013response model is the best available model for MERS. Several dose\u2013response studies for SARS were evaluated to determine a recommended dose\u2013response model (De Albuquerque et al., 2006; DeDiego et al., 2008; Mitchell & Weir, n.d.; Watanabe, Bartrand, Weir, Omura, & Haas, 2010). Recommended SARS dose\u2013response model follows the exponential dose\u2013response relationship (Equation (14)) for exposure dose expressed in PFU and the probability of a response based on an end point of death in mice (De Albuquerque et al., 2006; DeDiego et al., 2008). For translating this animal dose\u2013response relationship to a human dose\u2013response relationship, a generally accepted assumption that a death end point for an animal model may be used for examining the human risk of infection was applied (Haas, Rose, & Gerba, 2014).",

For these reasons, the proposed best\u2010fit SARS\u2010CoV dose\u2013response from QMRA Wiki website was applied (Huang, 2013). However, it must be mentioned that some other researchers applied different SARS\u2010CoV dose\u2013response, such as the Xiao et al. (2018) team did. In addition, since depending on the context, SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV may show different or higher infectivity (Chan et al., 2015), the question could arise to maybe use a developed dose\u2013response from other RNA viruses, such as influenza (Chabrelie, Mitchell, Rose, Charbonneau, & Ishida, 2018) or any other. Yet, estimated risk of infection is believed to slightly vary if using other SARS\u2010CoV dose\u2013responses, because of their relatively similar k parameter value: Xiao et al. (2018) referring to a k value of 0.0032, while DeDiego et al. (2008) estimated a median k value of 0.00297 and De Albuquerque et al. (2006) estimated a median k value of 0.00214, all to be compared with the median k value of 0.00246 derived from the best\u2010fit SARS\u2010CoV dose\u2013response provided by QMRA (Huang, 2013).",

The visitor data (i.e., frequency and duration) were obtained from a hospital in New York City (Cohen et al., 2012), which may not accurately represent the visitor behavior in all countries. For instance, in South Korea the healthcare system can give responsibility to family members of the patients to provide some care for the patients, leading hospital rooms to be often crowded with patients and their families or privately hired healthcare aids taking care of the patients (Ki, 2015).",

In consequence, this parameter appears to possibly change the risk estimation. Running the model with a 1:1 ratio gave daily risk of infection at 6 ACH about 2 log higher than the ones reported with a 1,239:1 ratio (developed base model), with new mean daily risk of 3.07 \u00d7 10\u22122, 2.96 \u00d7 10\u22122, 2.26 \u00d7 10\u22122, and 1.39 \u00d7 10\u22122 for nurses, healthcare workers, family visitors, and other patients, respectively (data not shown). Applying a uniform distribution from 1:1 to 1,600:1 for the copies:PFU ratio lead this parameter to contribute for risk variance to about 3%. Because the RNA copies:PFU proposed by Sampath et al. (2005) was derived from SARS\u2010CoV isolated from multiple different animals, and because Xiao et al. (2018) applied a 1:1 ratio simply because they recognized no ratios were reported for MERS\u2010CoV, this study used the median ratio of 1,239:1 proposed by Houng et al. (2004).",

Despite the fact that literature suggests aerosol\u2010generating procedures such as bronchoscopy or intubation might amplify viral transmission (Tran, Cimon, Severn, Pessoa\u2010Silva, & Conly, 2012), this study did not consider this aspect, as a simplifying assumption to develop a simple and easily adaptable model. Since an index patient in the MERS was reported having undergone a bronchoscopic examination and nebulizer therapy (Park et al., 2016), risk of infection might be underestimated. However, it must be clarified that according to Seto's (2015) and Thompson et al.\u2019s (2013) works, nebulizer usage have been proven to not significantly increase the viral transmission through air. Other exposure routes of infection, such as the fecal\u2010oral and fomite transfer routes that have been postulated for other CoVs, were not included in this analysis. This decision was motivated by the fact that literature suggests that MERS transmission mainly occurs through the short\u2010range airborne exposure route (Xiao et al., 2018).",

The outbreak selected was one of the two major outbreaks that occurred in South Korea, specifically the one reported in the Samsung Medical Center hospital outbreak in Seoul, for which attack rates per population exposed were given from literature (Cho et al., 2016). No viral loads were reported from literature for the shedding index\u2010patient in this outbreak. However, researchers suggest that major outbreaks occurred because of a \u201csuper\u2010spreader\u201d index\u2010patient having a disproportionately higher viral load in their respiratory system (Xiao et al., 2018). Hence, the model was run applying a triangular distribution based on the reported highest observed MERS\u2010CoV concentration found in sputum of MERS\u2010carrying patients (Min et al., 2016), using the reported minimum of 5.00 \u00d7 108, average of 6.30 \u00d7 108, and maximum of 1.40 \u00d7 109 copies/mL. Corman et al. (2015) even reported a concentration as high as 1011 copies/mL, but this value was not used since researchers suggested it to be very unlikely, mentioning that the probable highest concentration would more likely fall around 109 copies/mL during the first week of shedding. Additionally, a two\u2010day exposure duration (before diagnosis) was set based on the observed 44\u2010hour exposure time in the South Korean MERS outbreak (Cho et al., 2016). Finally, a rate of 3 ACH for the ventilation rate in the emergency room was used to match the outbreak conditions (Cho et al., 2016). Under these conditions, the calculated median risks of infection were found to be in the same ranges of the ones reported from Cho et al. (2016). Estimated median risks were found to be of 2.08 \u00d7 10\u22122, 1.82 \u00d7 10\u22122, 9.82 \u00d7 10\u22123, and 7.14 \u00d7 10\u22123 for nurses, healthcare workers, family visitors, and other patients sharing the room, respectively, while attack rates observed from the outbreak were measured at 2.72 \u00d7 10\u22122, 1.85 \u00d7 10\u22122, 5.56 \u00d7 10\u22122, and 4.44 \u00d7 10\u22122, for same exposed groups. These comparable results provide validity to the model developed herein; thus, demonstrating its applicability to known outbreaks.",

In the main outbreaks, nearly all the cases were spread within a hospital setting, where the infected patient visited the hospitals, but was not quarantined.

Sensitivity analysis showed that the concentration of MERS\u2010CoV in patient's saliva was the most sensitive parameter, constituting over 90% of the parameter uncertainty. The concentration of viruses in sputum is an inherently variable parameter that changes during the course of infection, illness, and recovery.
