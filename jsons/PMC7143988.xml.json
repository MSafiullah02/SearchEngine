Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales are included in the list of urgent threats provided by the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest-threats.html [3]), and its dissemination throughout the world is a major public health worry. Carbapenemases are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing almost all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and they are commonly located in plasmids, allowing to be spread throughout a great diversity of Gram-negative bacteria [4,5]. Serine carbapenemases (KPC) and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (NDM, IMP, VIM) are the most prevalent carbapenemases reported all around the globe [6], KPC being the first to be described in 2001 in an isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae in USA [7]. Carbapenem-resistant isolates within K. pneumoniae have been spread globally [8,9,10,11], including clone 307, which has significantly increased in the mid-1990s and is associated with several resistance genes, such as OXA-48 [12,13].",

Nowadays, several outbreaks have been registered in many South America countries, including Colombia [18], Argentina [19], and Brazil [20]. There are 11 allelic variants of OXA-48-like that have been described up to now [21]. The gene blaOXA-48 is located in 60- to 70-kb conjugative plasmids, generally associated with the transposon Tn1999 and its variants Tn1999.2 and Tn1999.3, and in the majority of the published data it has been associated with a nearby copy of IS1R [18,22,23]. Interestingly, OXA-48-like \u03b2-lactamases hydrolyzes penicillins and carbapenems but spares extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Here we report the first case of Klebsiella pneumoniae ST 307 carrying the blaOXA-48-like carbapenemase gene in Ecuador, and we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize the carrying plasmid.",

            "text": "The ST307 genome contains some virulence genes, suggesting that this clone might harbor the necessary tools to confer advantages in the hospital environment [50]. For example, glycogen synthesis can provide long-term survival and growth in environments outside the host as it increases biofilm formation, which has been correlated with nosocomial pathogens [13,53,54,55]. Moreover, the presence of the IncF plasmid, which is spread among the Enterobacterales, was identified, suggesting that this may be involved in the diffusion of resistance determinants and, with a combination of certain high-risk clones, contribute to the dissemination of AMR genes [5,56], which has been previously reported for K. pneumoniae [57,58]. From a search of the Institute Pasteur database (https://bigsdb.pasteur.fr/klebsiella/; 3987 STs last updated 10 April 2019), 35 human and 1 environmental isolate around the world were ST307 and 12 isolates from Europe and 1 from Asia were found in human samples with carbapenemase blaOXA-48-like [50]. We recently reported a strain of Raoutella ornithinolytica that harbored the blaOXA-48-like gene with no plasmid characterization that was recovered after this strain [59], and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of carrying OXA-48-like carbapenemase in an IncL plasmid isolated in Ecuador. Interestingly, our patient came from Croatia were this mechanism of resistance was reported previously [60,61,62], indicating that contagion with this strain most likely happened in Europe. The implications of globalization and free travel are now being revealed with the fast spread of the SARS-CoV-19, but in reality, this is nothing new and it has long been the case with mechanisms of resistance. Overall, these results highlight the implications of globalization, supporting previously published data from here and other countries [59,63,64,65,66]. Altogether this suggests that global guidelines for antibiotic stewardship might need to be implemented in order to better control the dissemination of the current increasing antibiotic resistance. This type of emergent resistance mechanism has an important risk as it can be easily spread between different environments, especially hospital settings. Further research will be performed in order to monitor this strain and others that can carry this and other mechanisms of resistance.",
