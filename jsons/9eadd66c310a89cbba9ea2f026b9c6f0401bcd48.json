The investigation of the antibacterial effect of essential oils (EOs), which are commonly used nowadays in cosmetics, health care, traditional medicine and food industry, could be one of the promising solutions for this worldwide problem. EOs have a complex mode of action due to their multiple composition. Respiratory tract diseases (RTDs) associated with bacterial infection and inflammation affect a large number of people from every age group worldwide. Because of volatility, EOs can easily reach the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract via inhalation. Moreover, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory potency, they offer an effective treatment in respiratory tract infections (RTIs). The purpose of this review is to describe the most frequently developing infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and to show methods used for the determination of the antibacterial activity of EOs by gaseous contact. The mode of action of EOs on bacterial cells and their anti-inflammatory action are also discussed. Results coming from recently performed in vivo animal studies as well as human trials are also reported. Patents deal with the role of EOs and their volatile constituents in the treatment of RTIs are also introduced. On the whole, this review aimed at showing EOs as potential antimicrobials and as anti-inflammatory agents to alleviate symptoms and signs of RTDs including RTIs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Essential oils (EOs) are the mixture of volatile compounds, mainly mono-and sesquiterpenoids, phenylpropanoids, etc., containing hundreds of individual chemical constituents, which may have biological activity. They are secreted in special cells, in secretion ducts or cavities or in glandular hairs from which they are extracted by distillation (water-steam or hydro-distillation), pressing, enfleurage, solvents or by supercritical fluid extraction. [1] In general, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-MS) is used to determine the chemical composition of EOs. It is well known that EO composition is influenced by many factors, e.g. environmental conditions, soil type, plant part, chemotype of plant species, isolation process, etc., [2] which determine its biological activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 452, "end": 455, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 742, "end": 745, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Because of the spread of multidrug resistant bacteria and the growing antibiotic resistance to them many research groups have focused their research programmes on investigating the antimicrobial activities of plants and their extracts in the hope of discovering new antibiotics. Therefore, the number of publications about the in vitro antimicrobial activity of EOs has been dramatically increasing, in most cases without any innovation. It has been previously demonstrated that the oxygenated terpenoids in EOs, e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, peroxides, and phenols, are responsible for strong antimicrobial activity and influence bacterial growth. [3] In vitro studies about antimicrobial activity of EOs describe a wide range of assays, e.g. disc diffusion, agar diffusion, broth dilution, etc., with different parameters (bacterial or fungal strains, agar recipes, incubation time, solvents, etc.) thus their results are difficult to compare with each other. In most cases their reliability is questionable. Because of volatile and non-water soluble properties of EOs, the common screening methods (e.g. disc diffusion or agar absorption) are not appropriate for their antimicrobial testing. Hood et al. [4] compared the results of different methods used for determination of antimicrobial activity of EOs. The authors concluded that the disc diffusion method does not provide true results because only the more water soluble components diffuse into the agar medium. The broth dilution method is mostly acceptable but the Tween concentration used for enhancing the solubility of EOs must be taken into consideration, because it may increase bacterial growth or alter cell permeability. Tween may show antagonistic or synergistic effect with EO resulting in lower or higher antimicrobial activity. Therefore, it is highly important that the parameters of our methods will be optimized before investigations are carried out to produce reproducible antimicrobial results of EOs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 662, "end": 665, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1223, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "According to the data of World Health Organization (WHO), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are responsible for 5% (3.1 million people) of deaths worldwide regarding both sexes. This number was 6% in the female group and 5% in the male group. [5] In 2012, pneumonia was responsible for 13% of causes of death among post-neonatal (1-59 month) children. [6] Based on WHO data, LRTIs and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have remained the top major killers during the past decade. [7] Although WHO has a well-organized global vaccine action plan against most bacteria or viruses causing RTIs, many people suffer from influenza, pneumonia or tuberculosis and without proper treatment these diseases can kill many people worldwide. EOs may possess a preventive role in the treatment of RTIs. The application of EOs via inhalation seems to be the most effective way to cure patients, because of their volatile nature they can reach the site intended to be treated. [8] In this review we give a short overview of the infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts focusing on the most frequently developing diseases in patients. Among in vitro methods the vapour phase test (VPT) can be acceptable to detect the antimicrobial activity of volatile compounds in the airways. Therefore, VPT will be introduced in this review.

The oroand nasopharynx are lined with stratified squamous epithelial cells, which contain microbial flora. It is important to highlight that upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) may spread and become more serious because the mucous membrane of the upper tract is continuous with the mucosal lining of the sinuses, eustachian tube, middle ear, and lower respiratory tract.

If the infection (e.g. with parainfluenza viruses) affects not only the larynx but also the trachea or bronchi, the croup becomes a more serious disease. [9] An infection of the epiglottis and other soft tissues above the vocal cords is called epiglottitis. The symptoms include fever, difficulty in swallowing, and respiratory obstruction with inspiratory stridor. In contrast to laryngitis, epiglottitis is usually caused by bacterial infection, mainly by Haemophilus influenzae type b.

[9] Rhinitis (common cold) affects both children and adults and is mainly caused by viruses. It is characterized by fever, increased mucous secretion, sneezing, and watery eyes. [9] Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) Trachea, bronchi and bronchioles belong to the lower part of the respiratory system. The most important diseases (acute or chronic bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia) and pathogens of the lower part of respiratory tract were summarized in Table 2 and  Table 3 . [9] Acute bronchitis is an acute inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree accompanied by cough, fever and often clear sputum production. As the illness persists the sputum may become purulent. Acute bronchitis is mainly caused by viruses but in 40% of cases bacterial infection is responsible for the symptoms. [10] In chronic bronchitis excessive mucus production leads to coughing up sputum on most days during at least 3 consecutive months for more than 2 successive years. [11] Patients with chronic bronchitis can suffer from acute flare-ups of infection. This illness is mainly caused by pathogenic bacteria, e.g. non-encapsulated H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for 40% to 80% of bronchiolitis cases showing marked seasonality (during winter and early spring). [9] Pneumonia is the inflammation of the LRT involving the lungs and supporting tissues. It is a dangerous infection, because it can easily lead to the patients' death. There are two major categories of pneumonias: community-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia associated with hospital, ventilation or health care. The pathogenesis of pneumonias is complicated, and organisms can cause infection in many possible ways (e.g. by upper airway colonization or aspiration of organisms). Pneumonias are mainly caused by viruses (e.g. adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza, varicella, rubeola, or RSV), but after primary infection, viruses can inhibit host defence mechanisms leading to a secondary bacterial infection. In general, fever, chills, chest pain, and cough suggest pneumonia, but 10% to 30% of patients complain of headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and myalgias. [9] It should be highlighted that the aetiology of acute pneumonias is strongly dependent on age. More than 80% of pneumonias in infants or children are caused by viruses, whereas less than 10% of pneumonias in adults are viral. [9] Unfortunately, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among hospitalized patients. [12, 13] Some of these pneumonias occur due to contaminated equipment used for inhalation therapy.

The impairment of some factors, e.g. decreased mucociliary function, decreased cough reflex, may contribute to a greater incidence of pneumonia in the elderly.

[29] Among in vitro methods, the vapour phase test (VPT) demonstrates the vapour activity of EOs in the most appropriate way, and these results may be useful to understand the antimicrobial activity of them in the respiratory tract. In VPT, generally, a paper disc containing EO is placed on the inside surface of the upper lid of a Petri-dish. The lower lid contains agar, and a suspension of test microorganism containing approximately 10 6 cfu/mL is spread over this surface. The plate is immediately inverted on top of the lid and sealed with parafilm to prevent leakage of the vapour. After incubation an inhibition of bacterial growth on the agar plate can be detected, which is the measure of EO activity. This method provides only relative values, because only a few authors define the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in atmosphere (MIC air ) by applying airtight boxes. [30] In 1959, the vapour activity of EOs was published first by Maruzzella et al. [31] and Kienholz. [32] Today the inverted Petri-dish technique is used by several researchers. [33, 34] In some cases an airtight box of 1 L air capacity was applied to increase the vapour concentration of EO.

Moreover, factors (e.g. volatility, evaporation speed and stability of EO, exposure time, chemical composition of EO, incubation temperature, growth phase and location of microorganism tested, and concentration of EO in VP) affecting the efficacy of vapour activity of EOs were also discussed. Based on this review, EOs can be used as air disinfectants in healthcare environments to control RTIs due to their antibacterial activity observed at optimized VP conditions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 85, "end": 89, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 971, "end": 975, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1057, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1076, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1153, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1157, "text": "34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1268, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1313, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tea tree oil"}, {"text": "Unfortunately, there are only a few number of articles in which respiratory tract pathogens were tested.

Cinnamon bark, lemongrass and thyme oils (wild-, red-and geranioltype) showed the lowest minimal inhibitory dose (MID, mg/L in air), followed by EOs containing terpene alcohols. EOs rich in ketone, ether and hydrocarbon had high MIDs. The authors also concluded that antibacterial activity of EOs was most effective at high vapour concentration and short exposure time.

In a sealed box environment, the growth of MRSA was reduced by 38% after 20 h exposure to BioScent TM vapour. In an office environment, this EO mixture produced 89% reduction of airborne bacteria in 15 h. These results suggested that geranium/lemongrass oils could be used for air disinfection. [34] The airborne anti-tuberculosis activity of Eucalyptus citriodora EO was investigated by Alvarenga et al. [37] In this study, biochemometrics, 3D analytical approaches involving highresolution CCC fractionation, GC-MS, bioactivity measurements, and chemometric analysis were used. The anti-tuberculosis activity was measured by an inverted Petri-dish technique. In the E. citriodora EO, 32 active compounds were identified, e.g. citronellol, linalool, isopulegol, \u03b1-terpineol, spatulenol and \u03b2-eudesmol. Artificial mixtures (AMxs) method was used to demonstrate the interaction between the EO components. The AMxs containing citronellol, citronellal and eucalyptol showed anti-tuberculosis activity, while citronellal, the major constituent of E. citriodora oil, had weak activity on its own.

In one study, the cellular effects of Inula graveolens and Santolina corsica EOs on S. aureus ATCC 6538P strain were investigated. [39] The effects of time and treatment dose on cell viability were determined by time-kill and bacteriolysis assays. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the marked structural changes caused by the EO treatments. The authors suggested that the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall are involved in the toxic action of I. graveolens and S. corsica EOs. Muthaiyan et al.

Results showed that 0.1% of CPVO oil induced cell wall stress stimulus was consistent with the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and triggered cell lysis observed with transmission electron microscopy. Since EOs can disrupt the cell membrane structure, they indirectly affect the toxin secretion of different bacteria. [39] To date, studies have demonstrated that the bacterial cell targets of EOs include the cell wall and membrane, thereby disturbing ATP production and pH homeostasis. Moreover, EOs can influence the cellular transcriptome, proteome, and the quorum-sensing system. [41] It is well-known that Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to EOs than Gram-positive bacteria because of the difference in their cell wall structure. In 2013 Nazzaro et al. [42] published a review about the mode of action of EOs on pathogenic bacteria. They concluded that EOs and their components have single target or multiple targets during their antimicrobial activity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 291, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 673, "end": 677, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1121, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1387, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1570, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Tea tree oil"}, {"text": "As we mentioned previously, there are only a few number of publications in which the mechanism of an EO on bacteria caused by RTIs was published. In the study performed by Bouhdid et al. [43] the activity of cinnamon EO (CEO) containing 73.3% of Ecinnamaldehyde was investigated against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The cell membrane permeability of P. aeruginosa was more disturbed after CEO treatment than in the case of S. aureus. However, flow cytometric analysis revealed that in the presence of CEO S. aureus entered in a viable but nonculturable state. In this state the virulence potential of bacteria is preserved and the cycle of infection will restart when bacterial cells recover their full metabolic capacity. This fact must be taken into consideration when EO activity is evaluated. Previously, our workgroup had demonstrated the effect of CEO and clove EO (CLEO) on outer membrane protein (OMP) composition of P. aeruginosa. [44] The oils were administered to the culture at concentrations of 0.5 x MIC and 2 x MIC and incubated for 60 min. Some proteins disappeared after the treatment of CEO and CLEO. Decreases in the amount of some proteins may be explained by the protein synthesis inhibiting effect of these oils. We received similar results to the study published first by Burt et al. [45] The mode of antimicrobial action of EOs is highly related to their chemical composition. [41, 42] For example, in a study aromadendrene as the main compound of Eucalyptus globulus oil (EGO) showed higher MIC value against P. aeruginosa than the 1,8-cineole-rich EGO. [46] Aromadendrene having cyclopropane ring can cause alkylation of proteins, and results in their altered conformation. [47] Furthermore, the chemical change (e.g. oxidation) of EO components may contribute to their antibacterial action. [35] Oxidation of citral, d-limonene and \u03b1-pinene in air has been already experienced and their 'products' contributed to higher antibacterial action. [48, 49] EO constituents can also interact with transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels located in the airways. [18] This TRP superfamily of cation channels is divided into six subfamilies based on sequence homology, including TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPA (ankyrin), TRPP (polycystin) and TRPML (mucolipin). [50] These ion channels are thought to play a key role in respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD) and cough. They can be activated by a diverse range of chemicals, e.g. capsaicin and citral (TRPV1 agonists), menthol and 1,8-cineol (TRPM8 agonists), allyl isothiocyanate, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde (TRPA1 agonists) and physical stimuli (e.g. temperature, membrane potential changes and osmotic stress). [18] The investigation of the selective blockers (antagonists) of these channels, which is a rapidly growing field, may provide attractive novel strategies to treat characteristic features of respiratory diseases. Previously, it has been demonstrated in experimental animals and patients with airway diseases that a marked hypersensitivity to cough was induced by TRPV1 agonists. [51] Therefore, TRPV1 receptor antagonists have been proposed as therapeutic candidates. [52] (\u00c0)-Menthol is a TRPV1 receptor antagonist. [53] Inhaled (\u00c0)-menthol (30 \u03bcg/L) decreased evoked cough in guinea pigs by 56%. [54] An inhaled mixture of 75% (\u00c0)menthol and 25% 1,8-cineole significantly reduced cough evoked by citric acid in healthy individuals. [55] In 2013, a review on the G. Horv\u00e1th and K. \u00c1cs wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ffj chemical and biological properties (e.g. cooling effects and toxicity) of menthol was published. [56] In a review published in 2011, Banner et al. [50] summarized the evidence that modulation of selected TRP channels may have beneficial effects in targeting key features of several respiratory diseases including inflammation of the airways, hyper-reactivity of the airways, mucus secretion and cough. They concluded that the introduction of selective TRP channel blockers in the clinical practice may open an exciting new chapter in the evaluation of TRP channel modulators as therapeutic agents, but despite the rapid and significant advances in the understanding of TRP channels in recent years important gaps in the pharmacological and physiological knowledge remain. [50] Because of the great number of constituents, EOs seem to have several potential cellular targets. [41] In vivo studies It is well known that the results coming from the in vivo animal models cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, but may provide valuable data about the mechanism of constituents tested. Before the full clinical application, further and more comprehensive in vivo studies are still required.

[90] 3060 patients were involved in the study. Pinimentol\u00ae ointment contains eucalyptus EO, pine-needle EO and menthol. This product was used for inunction (29.6% of patients), inhalation (17.3%) or inunction and inhalation (53.1%), respectively. The mean application time was 8.0 \u00b1 3.4 days. The tolerability was rated as excellent or good by 96.7% of physicians and 95.7% of patients. Only 22 patients (0.7%) reported adverse drug reactions, e.g. hypersensitivity skin reaction (n = 10), cough (n = 6), obstructive respiratory tract symptoms (n = 5) and hypersensitivity reactions of mucous membranes (n = 4). According to these results, authors suggested the application of Pinimentol\u00ae ointment in URTIs in both adolescents and adults. [90] Panahi et al. [91] investigated the effectiveness of a herbal product (Lamigex) containing the EO of Syzygium aromaticum, Lavandula angustifolia and Geranium robertianum in the treatment of acute external otitis (AEO) and compared its effects to those of ciprofloxacin. Seventy randomly assigned patients received ciprofloxacin 0.3% or Lamigex. Each group was administered with three drops every 12 hours for a week, in every case after cleansing the ear canal. After treatment, patients were examined by specialists for AEO symptoms. Moreover, ear discharge cultures were also checked at the beginning as well as at the end of this trial. Pain severity was also recorded with a visual analogue scale at the beginning, the third, and the seventh day of the study. Both antibiotic and Lamigex treatments improved the patients' conditions and reduced pain severity. However, the rate of pain improvement was different between the two groups. The number of positive cultures was also reduced by ciprofloxacin and Lamigex treatment by the end of the trial. [91] It is necessary to highlight that undiluted EOs should not be dripped into the ears, but diluted EOs may be placed on a cotton wad for partial insertion. [18] In a smaller study, [92] 24 randomly assigned adults suffering from common cold inhaled air with either steam or a mix of 9% eucalyptus EO, 35% camphor and 56% menthol w/w for 1 hour. The mean concentration of EO compounds in the inspired air was 56 \u03bcg/L. In the inhalation group, only 6 out of 22 spirometric parameters significantly improved when measured after 20 min, and 14 improved after 1 hour. These parameters included forced vital capacity (FVC: the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after full inspiration), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 : the amount of air forcibly exhaled in one second), forced expiratory volume in three seconds (FEV 3 : the amount of air forcibly exhaled in three seconds), maximum expiratory flow rate (MEFR: maximum forced flow rate during full expiration), and forced expiratory flow 25% (FEF 25% : the mean forced expiratory flow during the first 25% of FVC). [92, 18] In a prospective, randomized open study including 84 children of 5 to 15 year of age, the effect of Nigella sativa EO (NSEO) in the treatment of wheezing associated with lower respiratory tract illnesses was investigated. [93] The control group (n = 41) was administered with bronchodilators and the test group (n = 43) received NSEO orally in dose of 0.1 mL/kg body weight/day divided into two portions (every 12 h) for 14 days. Patients were examined on day 0 (before treatment), and on 3 rd , 7, 10 and 14 th day of treatment by measuring of the pulmonary index (PI) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) parameters. According to findings, NSEO significantly reduced the PI compared to the control group during 14 days. There was more improvement in the PEFR value in the test group than in the control group but this difference was not significant. [93] However, the authors proved the beneficial role of NSEO in the management of wheezing associated with lower respiratory tract illnesses, more studies involving more children are necessary to make a final conclusion regarding the safe application of this EO.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 264, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 999, "end": 1003, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2057, "end": 2061, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2216, "end": 2220, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2241, "end": 2245, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3149, "end": 3153, "text": "[92,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3154, "end": 3157, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3380, "end": 3384, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4010, "end": 4014, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Human trials"}, {"text": "In another prospective, randomized double-blind controlled trial, the activity of a spray containing EO of Eucalyptus citriodora, E. globulus, Mentha x piperita, Origanum syriacum, and Rosmarinus officinalis was studied in patients with URTI.

Then the change of the most debilitating symptoms (sore throat, hoarseness or cough) was assessed in patients. 20 minutes after the use of the spray, participants in the test group reported a greater improvement in symptoms compared to participants in the control group. There was no difference in symptom severity between the two groups after 3 days of treatment. Based on these results, authors suggested the local, rather than systemic, effect of this spray on the upper respiratory tract.

To achieve the appropriate treatment of RTDs (e.g. administration of antibiotic or anti-inflammatory medicine or inhalation with EO), it is definitely important to diagnose the type of microbiological agent causing RTDs including RTIs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Human trials"}, {"text": "The antimicrobial potency of EOs against respiratory tract pathogens has been well known for ages. Antimicrobial drugs often have a high price and side effects while the EOs are relatively cheap and safe natural materials. The application technique of these substances is variable depending on the symptoms of the disease and the treated area. The commonly used method is inhalation which can be divided into active and passive techniques. Active inhalation means that patients use an inhalation device or patch from where they can directly inhale the volatile components. EOs can be used with passive inhalation as well, when the EOs are applied into the environment via heating, vaporization or forced air ventilation. [89, 96] An old-fashioned and the cheapest way for relieving the symptoms of respiratory diseases is vapour inhalation over a bowl of hot water containing a small amount of eucalyptus oil (EUO). The inhalation could be effective with the application of a towel over the head because in this case we could directly inhale the concentrated aromatic components. [97] During the last few years several patents appeared, which tried to develop portable inhalation devices and suitable delivery systems for EOs. A cheap and practicable small pocket inhaler using EUO was invented for the treatment of respiratory conditions. In this simple device 70 drops of EO were applied to a fabric material in an appropriate glass vial, from where the patients can inhale the vapour directly through their nostrils or mouth. The best results were observed if the inhalation lasted for 3-5 minutes and it was repeated several times daily. [97] A similar inhaler, which can ease nasal congestion and quell cough consisting of a paper wrapper around a fibrous cylindrical plug with aromatic substances (EUO or menthol) along the centreline was developed. Towards the plug an airtight aluminium foil guarantees that the device is hermetically sealed and aromatic substances remain fresh. The simple use, lower price (compared to plastic inhalers) and disposable hygienic form are the advantages of this device. Patients can directly inhale the EO through their nose, which leads to the reduction of nasal congestion. [98] A personal aromatherapy device can release volatile substances from its flexible inner container covered with a rigid outer shell. The flexible inner part contains fibrous material (e.g. cotton) saturated with an aromatic substance (e.g. EO). A cap closes the inner part including a flip nozzle, which operates between defined positions and permits release of effective aromas when the patient inhales. In a closed position the nozzle confirms that the vapour of the EOs cannot escape when the inhaler is not used. The device can easily be operated with one hand and the flexible container can deliver any kind of aromatic substances in an exact amount. [99] Aromatherapy patch application is another possible solution for treating or preventing respiratory infections. In this case the use of a special carrier is also important which keeps the aromatic substances in fresh and constant form, and limits their release before the application. [100] The inventors presume that the living respiratory tract pathogens will be inactivated when getting into contact with the inhaled vapour, hence the saturated patch is usually placed in the vicinity of the nasal pathway with the application of an appropriate mask also. In a patent the adhesive patch contains safe and effective amounts of EOs (e.g. wintergreen, cinnamon, ginger, peppermint, lemon, clove, clary sage, and chamomile) alone or in combination. The patch is a unique vehicle with adhesive and a viscoelastic nature which maintains the stability and convenient use of EOs. When the patch was applied by the patient, the EO could continuously make contact with the skin of the patient and the volatile components released. In some cases inventors apply cyclodextrines to carry active substances and to control the release of the volatile components. [96] In another patent, an adhesive path containing a unique foraminous carrier was developed. The carrier can adhesively bind to the body parts (e.g. face, neck, and chest), where, after the release of the volatile substances (menthol, thymol, camphor, oil of peppermint, eucalyptus and ginger), they can be easily inhaled through the user's nose or mouth. A further benefit of the foraminous structure is that it can reduce the incidence of allergic reactions. [101] In another patent by Vail W. B. and Vail M. L., the possible use of some EOs in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome was described. [102] The authors recommend the inhalation of EO of Eucalyptus globulus, E. citriodora, E. radiatto, and Melaleuca alternifolia to reduce the risk of infection in public places. The duration and frequency of inhalation were precisely determined.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[89,", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 726, "end": 729, "text": "96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1646, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2221, "text": "[98]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 2876, "end": 2880, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 3165, "end": 3170, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 4031, "end": 4035, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 4494, "end": 4499, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 4646, "end": 4651, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Patents"}, {"text": "Further interesting patents are summarized in an article written by Sienkiewicz et al.

Firstly, the small sample size may limit the interpretation of results. Secondly, short periods of treatments (e.g. 3 days) are not sufficient for the interpretation of results, as well. Another limitation is associated with the safety use of EOs. However, in some cases investigators did not observe any severe side-effects, but larger-scale studies should be designed in order to conclude the safety application of EO formulas. In addition, it is difficult to perform a double-blind trial including EO or its individual constituent. Without a doubt, further studies, principally human trials, are needed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of EOs in respiratory tract diseases.
