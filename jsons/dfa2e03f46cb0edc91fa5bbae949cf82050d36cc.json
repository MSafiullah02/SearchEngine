Ketamine has been shown to be a promising and safe treatment for TRD in elderly patients. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly impacting the world and this disease is recognized as being particularly dangerous for the elderly and vulnerable patients. To limit the transmission of the disease, geriatric mental health specialists must be creative and ensure the safety of their patients by limiting human to human contact. This problem might be averted by massive deployment of outreach services and telemedicine strategies.",

            "text": "As medical care centres are rapidly populated by COVID-19 infected patients, high number of patients that travel to a treatment site might facilitate transmission of the disease. Regular outpatient treatment for TRD such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and ketamine can constitute an important risk for contagion and morbidity in older patients. This problem might be averted by massive deployment of outreach services (2) . In the pandemic context, geriatric mental health specialists must be creative to treat their patients safely. Ketamine has been shown to be a promising and safe treatment for TRD in elderly patients (3) . Furthermore, IN ketamine has also been demonstrated safe in ambulatory patients (4) . However, ketamine and esketamine treatment are normally offered through some sort of Risk and Mitigation Strategy program. This requirement is designed to make sure patients are monitored during the period when side effects of the drug are most likely to occur. Ketamine has some shortterm adverse effects including dissociation, psychotomimetic effects, and cardiovascular changes (5) . However, these side effects often resolve quickly, and patients who responded well to multiple ketamine treatments normally continue to respond well to subsequent treatments. Because ketamine is liable to abuse, these programs are also designed to prevent misuse and diversion. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that patients who had many successful acute treatments without important side effects and that have low risk of addiction can be treated safely at home. We believe the potential risks should not undermine the numerous potential benefits. Rather, the aim is to establish a framework and care plan that reduce these risks, which telemedicine permits. With this pandemic, our usual mode of care delivery is challenged and paradigm shifts are urgently needed. Further study that use this type of outreach approach for monitoring ketamine treatment might be particularly useful to treat elderly patient with TRD.",
