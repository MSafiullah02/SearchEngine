Quantitatively assessing the truthfulness of content becomes key, but it is often challenging and thus done by experts. In this work we look at how experts and non-expert assess truthfulness of content by focusing on the effect of the adopted judgment scale and of assessors' own bias on the judgments they perform. Our results indicate a clear effect of the assessors' political background on their judgments where they tend to trust content which is aligned to their own belief, even if experts have marked it as false. Crowd assessors also seem to have a preference towards coarse-grained scales, as they tend to use a few extreme values rather than the full breadth of fine-grained scales.",

For example, Zubiaga and Heng [17] looked at how tweet credibility can be assessed by means of Amazon MTurk workers in the context of disaster management. Their results show that it is difficult for crowd workers to properly assess the truthfulness of tweets in this context, but that the reliability of the source is a good indicator for trusted information. Kriplean et al. [6] analyse how volunteer crowdsourcing can be used for fact-checking by simulating the democratic process. The Fact-checking Lab at CLEF [3, 9] looks at this problem by defining the task of ranking sentences according to their need to be fact-checked. Maddalena et al. [7] focus on the ability of the crowd to assess news quality along eight different quality dimensions. Roitero et al. [10] use crowdsourcing to study user perception of fake news statements. As compared to previous studies looking at crowdsourcing for information credibility tasks, we look at bias in the data due to the assessor and the rating scale used to collected labels in the context of the truthfulness of statements by US politicians.",

Each HIT, rewarded $1.20 (i.e., $0.15 for each statement), consisted of 8 statements for which we asked an assessment either using the original 6-level scale (S6) or a 100-level scale (from 0 to 100) using a slider set by default at 50 (S100). The 8 statements contained 2 gold questions used to quality check the workers' responses by means of providing judgments consistent with the expert ground truth. Other than gold questions, each HIT contained 3 statements by Republican party speakers and 3 by Democratic party speakers. More than the judgments, crowd workers where also asked to provide a justification for each of their judgments, and a URL pointing to the source of information supporting their judgment. At the beginning of the HIT each worker was asked to complete a demographics questionnaire; it also included questions about their political orientation, used to classify crowd assessors as aligned to the US Democratic party (Dem) or the US Republican party (Rep).",

            "text": "Participants (400 in total) were well balanced across the political spectrum (108 Dem and 92 Rep for S6; 109 Dem and 91 Rep for S100) and most of them have a college degree. Many crowd assessors used the PolitiFact website as a source of evidence for their judgments (55.4% of judgments done with S6 and 54.9% of judgments done with S100) as shown in Table 1 . The list of URLs in this table also shows how the majority of crowd assessors performed the task correctly, as they tried to refer to reliable sources such as PolitiFact, Wikipedia, Washington Post, CNN, and New York Times. Figure 1 shows the raw assessment score distributions given by crowd workers both for the S6 scale and the S100 scale. These results hint that workers tend to use fewer values than those available: the extremes of the scales are more used; for S100, the middle value (50) is also frequently used and some smaller peaks can be seen in correspondence of the multiples of 10. These outcomes are much less manifest in the aggregated scores (i.e., the arithmetic mean of the scores provided by the ten crowd workers judging the same statement), shown in Fig. 2 : as usual, these are more evenly distributed. Also, values at the lower end of the scale are much less frequent. These outcomes suggest that perhaps a two-or three-level scale would be more appropriate for this task, although fine-grained scales have been successfully used in a crowdsourcing setting for relevance assessment [8, 11] . We intend to further address this issue in our future work also using the scale transformation techniques proposed by Han et al. [4] . Figure 3 shows the crowd assessor labels as compared to expert judgment of truthfulness over both judgments scales. Crowd assessors seem able to distinguish among the different levels of the S6 scale as the median values are increasing following the expert assessments over the levels of the scale. A t-test comparing crowd assessor scores across expert judgment levels shows that crowd scores are significantly different (p < 0.01) across all levels except for the class combinations Lie-False, False-Barely True, and Mostly True-True. The crowd appears to be more lenient than experts in assessing the truthfulness of statements as scores for the lowest categories tend not to reach the bottom end of the scale in both S6 and S100. This suggests the need to align scales when used by crowd assessors and experts in order to identify misleading content using crowdsourcing. Overall, S6 seems more adequate than S100, not only because (as noted above) workers tend to use coarse-grained scales but also because the agreement with experts seems higher for S6: S100 presents wider boxplots and less separable categories, especially for the first three classes (Lie, False, Barely True). Figure 4 shows how crowd assessors labelled statements as compared to ground truth expert labels based on their political background. We can see that crowd assessors who voted for the Rep party tend to assign higher truthfulness scores, especially for the Lie and False ground truth labels, showing how, on average, they believe to content more than crowd assessors who voted for the Dem party. When comparing how crowd workers assess statements differently based on who the speaker is, we can observe that True statements obtain higher scores from crowd assessors who voted for the speaker's party. That is, Dem workers assigned an average score of 84.54 on S100 and 5.48 on S6 to True statements by Dem speakers and only 81.83 on S100 and 5.00 on S6 to True statements by Rep speakers. Rep workers assigned an average score of 81.89 on S100 and 5.35 on S6 to True statements by Rep speakers and only 73.24 on S100 and 4.73 on S6 to True statements by Dem speakers. While this is an expected behaviour, we also notice that Dem crowd assessors appear to be more skeptical than Rep crowd assessors by showing a lower average judgment score for untrue statements (e.g., Fig. 4 , top row).
