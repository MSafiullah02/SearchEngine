To make decisions about mitigation strategies and to understand the disease dynamics, policy makers and epidemiologists must know how the disease is spreading in their communities. We analyze confirmed infections and deaths over multiple geographic scales to show that COVID-19's impact is highly unequal: many subregions have nearly zero infections, and others are hot spots. We attribute the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which disease arrives at different times and grows exponentially. Hot spots, however, appear to grow faster than neighboring subregions and dominate spatially aggregated statistics, thereby amplifying growth rates. The staggered spread of COVID-19 can also make aggregated growth rates appear higher even when subregions grow at the same rate. Public policy, economic analysis and epidemic modeling need to account for potential distortions introduced by spatial aggregation.",

An important consideration in these calculations is a measure of how quickly the virus is spreading within the communities: a fast spreading virus may force municipalities, states and nations to order residents to shelter at home to slow transmission.

The size of the outbreak is highly correlated with the growth rate in the subregion; therefore, when the synthetic data is aggregated to simulate state or national statistics, these hot spots systematically amplify the estimated growth rates, much like what is observed empirically.

The number of deaths in U.S. counties and states has a heavy-tailed distribution (Fig. 1a ). This means that the disease's toll varies enormously between places, with many communities almost unaffected and others hit hard by the pandemic.

The growth in the number of deaths within each Figure 1 : Inequality of COVID-19 impact and spatial aggregation bias. (a) The number of deaths has a heavy-tailed distribution for both states and counties, with the most cases in New York state and New York City, respectively. A stochastic model discussed in the main text captures the properties of the distribution. (b) Similar pattern is seen for infections at many spatial scales: from U.S. facilities to neighborhoods to nations. (c) Deaths over time for New York and some of its counties, where we see the disease arrives in counties at different times, but the initial growth rate is approximately exponential. Exponential growth is calculated between day 76 and 116 (inclusive) for New York state; the time window varies for each county. (d) The death growth rate in the U.S. is higher than most states, which is in turn higher on than growth rates in individual counties. Inset: this finding is also captured by the simulation. Findings are qualitatively similar in data of infections (see Supplementary Figure 4 ). county (and state) in the early stages of the outbreak can be roughly modeled by an exponential, which allows us to estimate the average growth rate (agreement with exponential fits has been checked in Supplementary Figure 6 ). There is a fairly broad distribution of death rates for counties and states (Fig. 1d ). However, this by itself is not enough to explain the heterogeneity in the number of cases or deaths. We must also consider that COVID-19 appears in each subregions at different times.",

            "text": "This phenomenon is closely related to the Reed-Hughes mechanism (8), which explains how exponentially growing populations of different ages produce a power-law distribution of population sizes. However, the Reed-Hughes mechanism specifies that populations have the same growth rate and begin growing with uniform probability in time. In contrast, the start time of the outbreak in each county is approximately normally distributed, as is the growth rate. To validate the modified mechanism, we create synthetic data in which simulated counties have outbreaks that start at times drawn at random from a normal distribution, with growth rates chosen from another normal distribution and coefficients of growth rates drawn from a log-normal distribution. All distribution parameters are empirically measured from fits to data, except arrival times that are gathered directly from data. Synthetic outbreaks within our simulated counties follow a heavy-tailed distribution (blue line in Fig. 1a ) similar to the empirical distribution for counties. The situation is somewhat more complex for states. Simply dividing counties across states at random, so that each simulated state ends up aggregating data over 62 counties (this is the mean number of counties in a state), creates a very sharply-peaked distribution, unlike what we observe. Instead, we divide up counties non-uniformly across states such that the number of counties in these simulated states matches the true distribution. This re-creates the heavy-tailed distribution of the number of deaths for states (orange line in Fig. 1a) . These results demonstrate that large heterogeneity in the data creates a qualitatively similar outcome as the Reed-Hughes mechanism.",

The hot spots dominate the statistics and are correlated with faster growing infections ( Fig. 3 and 4) . This makes deaths and infections appear to grow faster when spatially aggregated, such as aggregating data from counties to the state level. Similarly, the growth rate at the national level appears to be higher than death rates within constituent states and counties (Fig. 1d) . Aggregation bias is also observed in simulated data with synthetic counties and states ( Fig. 1d inset and 4a inset) . Alike to what we observe empirically, we find Spearman correlations of 0.35 between growth rates and simulated number of deaths or growth rates and simulated numbers of infections (p-values < 10 \u22126 ). To better understand why, we make a simulation where infections grow with the same exponential growth rate (\u223c 10 0.05t or 11.5% a day), and the arrival time of the infection in each neighborhood matches LA data. In this idealized simulation, each neighborhood's growth rate can be easily fit to an exponential, but the aggregate fails to follow an exponential.

We find that growth rates are correlated with population and population density (see Figs. 3 and 4): COVID-19 spreads more quickly in large and dense counties, states and nations. Population density appears to play a somewhat more important role in explaining death growth rates for states. However, this is not the case for infections, where population, rather than population density, better explains the growth of infections across multiple spatial scales (Fig. 4c ), in agreement with trends for cities reported by (11) . While it seems intuitive that denser places with more interpersonal interaction are at a greater risk for spreading the disease, this may not be the entire explanation. Instead, it appears that the total number of people is an important driver. In addition, communities where the disease arrived earlier also tend to have higher growth rates, possibly because it was allowed to spread before mitigation measures were introduced.",

Compartmental models typically have fewer fitting parameters than spatio-temporal models (14) (15) (16) , and therefore, may be better at making intermediate-range forecasts (2).

The threshold is three for Los Angeles neighborhood data because agreement with exponential is reasonable even when we start with this lower threshold. Over time the data deviates from exponential growth. We consider the data to deviate significantly if we have more than two consecutive days of growth below 0.5%. Those two days, and all subsequent data, is removed from analysis. A more stringent threshold of 0.1% growth over three days produces very similar results. In addition, we only fit data with more than five datapoints. Calculations of R 2 are based on this log-scaling of data. We observe the infection growth rate of the U.S. is higher than most states, which is, in turn, higher than most counties. (b) We find population correlates strongly with growth rate from neighborhoods in LA to countries, but population density is less important. The time since the first infection is weakly correlated with the growth rate. Whatever the reason for the growth rate, we find the number of infections strongly correlates with the growth rate, therefore fast-growing areas dominate the statistics. Examples of growth rates versus (c) population and (d) population density. Compare to Fig. 1 and 3 in the main text. . Surprisingly, the world as a whole has a growth rate comparable to most countries, most likely because the growth rate is initially dominated by just one country, China, therefore the world growth is dominated by the first, rather than the fastest growing, country.
