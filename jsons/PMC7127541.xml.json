BVDV is an enveloped, single-strand positive-sense RNA virus responsible for polymorphic clinical signs [4], which includes two separate species, termed BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 [5], [6], and several subtypes within each species [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. The BVDV genomic RNA encodes for a polyprotein (NH2-Npro-C-Erns-E1-E2-p7-NS2-3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH), which is processed by viral and cellular proteases, thus generating structural and non-structural proteins. The single large open reading frame is flanked by the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) [4].",

This virus, named D32/00_\u2018Hobi\u2019, was proposed as prototype of a new pestivirus species, BVDV-3 [17]. \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestiviruses were detected in different parts of the world in FCS batches of southern American origin [18], [19], [20] or in animals with natural infection but without overt disease [18], [21]. \u2018Hobi\u2019-like sequences were detected in aborted bovine foetuses in Brazil, thus suggesting direct clinical implications [22]. More recently, a \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strain was associated to severe respiratory disease and abortion in a cattle herd in Italy [23], [24], which posed some issues about the real efficacy of BVDV control or eradication programs. In fact, the existing methods employed commonly in BVDV surveillance programs either do not detect at all [16], [20], [21] or have a low sensitivity in detecting the new pestivirus, which is in addition mistyped as BVDV-2 [25]. A real-time RT-PCR assay has been established for identification of \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strains [26], but this method is not able to detect simultaneously BVDV-1/BVDV-2 which should be required for extensive use in eradication programs.",

The panpestivirus RT-PCR developed by Vilcek et al. [39], which is commonly used for BVDV molecular screening, does not detect \u2018Hobi\u2019-like sequences due to the presence of a mismatch at the 3\u2032 end of primer 324 that prevents the correct primer annealing. Other conventional and real-time RT-PCR protocols are able to detect \u2018Hobi\u2019-like pestivirus but do not provide any virus typing, which is helpful to assess virus epidemiology [40], [41], [42], [43]. A TaqMan assay that was claimed to be specific for the new pestivirus (putative BVDV-3) was recently developed [26], but this assay could not type simultaneously BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 and showed a limited cross-reaction with high-titre BVDV-2 samples (N. Decaro, personal observation). If current diagnostic tests based on nucleic acid detection may miss \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strains, there may be antigen-detection kits that do detect the virus. These assays may have a certain value for pestivirus surveillance in cattle herds, but are likely to be less useful for eradication programs that require virus typing to determine the source of infection and evaluate lack of protection by using available vaccines.",

            "text": "In the present study, an nPCR assay able to detect and type simultaneously all bovine pestivirus species was developed and compared to a PCR protocol established previously for ruminant pestivirus typing targeting the Erns gene [35]. Although alternative PCR protocols have been established for BVDV-1/BVDV-2 typing [44], [45], the Sullivan and Akkina\u2019s protocol was chosen for comparison with the novel assay, as it is employed routinely in our lab and all clinical samples processed in this study had been already analysed by that assay. Processing of field samples resulted in the identification of three additional \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strains in southern Italy, which had been mistyped as BVDV-2 by using the Erns protocol. Two of these strains were associated to abortion in the same cattle herd [24], whereas the third strain was recovered from an outbreak of respiratory disease (N. Decaro, unpublished). Although the novel assay was set up using only one \u2018Hobi\u2019-like reference strain (Italy-1/10-1), detection of these three additional strains in field samples accounts for its ability to correctly identify and type the new bovine pestivirus. Indeed, sequence analysis of the most divergent \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strain currently known, Th/04_KhonKaen [46], showed no point mutations in the specific-oligonucleotide binding regions, thus supporting the hypothesis that diverse \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strains are likely detected by the established nPCR assay. Nevertheless, ongoing testing would be needed to fully validate the test particularly with the limited \u2018Hobi\u2019-like strains tested.",
