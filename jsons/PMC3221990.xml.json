Several microorganisms may be causative agents of CAP, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause [1]. Inherited genetic variants of components of the human immune system influence the susceptibility to and the severity of infectious diseases. In humans, primary immunodeficiencies (PID) affecting opsonization of bacteria and NF-\u03baB-mediated activation have been shown to predispose to invasive infections by respiratory bacteria, particularly S. pneumoniae [2]. Conventional PID are mendelian disorders, but genetic variants at other genes involved in opsonophagocytosis, with a lower penetrance, may also influence susceptibility and severity of these infectious diseases with a complex pattern of inheritance [3].",

SP-A1, -A2 and -D belong to the collectin subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily, and contain both collagen-like and carbohydrate-binding recognition domains (CRDs) [4]. Upon binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), SP-A and SP-D enhance the opsonophagocytosis of common respiratory pathogens by macrophages [5,6]. Mice rendered SP-A or SP-D deficient exhibit increased susceptibility to several bacteria and viruses after intratracheal challenge [7-9]. SP-A1, -A2 and -D also play a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammatory responses [4,10,11] and clearance of apoptotic cells [4,12,13]. In mice, SP-A and SP-D have been shown to be non-redundant in the immune defense in vivo [9].",

On the basis of the differences in non-synonymous SNPs (SFTPA1-aa19, -aa50, -aa219, SFTPA2-aa9, -aa91, -aa223) the most frequent conventional haplotypes of these genes, except 1A and 1A5, can be unambiguously identified (see Table E1 in Additional File 1). However, this method does not allow for the differentiation of some of these haplotypes from those rare haplotypes (frequency equal or lower than 1%) identified with the SNPs indicated in Table E1 in Additional File 1. For comparative purposes, in our study each haplotype was denoted by the name of the most frequent haplotype for a given combination of non-synonymous SNPs. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood according to standard phenol-chloroform procedure or with the Magnapure DNA Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, USA). Genotyping of polymorphisms in SFTPA1 (aa19, aa50, aa219), SFTPA2 (aa9, aa91, aa223) and SFTPD (aa11) genes was carried out using minor modifications of previously reported procedures [15,20]. The accuracy of genotyping was confirmed by direct sequencing in an ABI Prism 310 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) sequencer.",

The frequencies of the different SNPs and haplotypes of SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD observed in our study were similar to those previously reported in European populations [25]. SFTPA1 and SFTPA2 were reported to be in strong LD [26,27], and several haplotypes of these loci tend to segregate together, being 6A2-1A0 the major haplotype [27]. A protective role against CAP was associated with 6A2, 1A0 and 6A2-1A0 in our survey but only the rare 1A10 and 6A3-1A haplotypes were significantly associated with susceptibility to CAP. Similar results were observed in susceptibility to pneumococcal CAP. Several SNPs and haplotypes were also associated with a higher severity and poor outcome; MODS, ARDS, and mortality were selected because they represent the more severe clinical phenotypes. Particularly, 1A10 and 6A-1A were overrepresented among patients who died at 28 or 90 days, and they also predisposed to MODS and ARDS respectively. Likewise, 6A was associated with ARDS, and 1A was associated with MODS. By contrast, 6A3 and 6A3-1A1 were underrepresented in patients who died. The SFTPD aa11-C allele was associated with the development of MODS and ARDS, but no significant effects on mortality were observed. In spite that the power of the test for some associations with outcome and severity were higher than 80% for the observed OR with a significance level of 5%, the number of individuals included in the analysis of outcome was relatively small. Consequently, associations with outcome should be interpreted with caution.",

In bacterial infections, homozygosity for the 1A1 haplotype was reported to be associated with meningococcal disease [30]. Noteworthy, 6A2-1A0 was protective against acute otitis media (AOM) in children [32]. Haplotypes 6A2 and 1A0 may also be involved in protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease [29,33]. Considering the high difference in the frequencies with the corresponding alternative alleles and haplotypes, it is tempting to speculate that 6A2, 1A0 and 6A2-1A0 could have been maintained at high frequencies partly by their protective effect against respiratory infections. The 6A and 6A-1A haplotypes were found to be associated with an increased risk of wheeze and persistent cough, presumably triggered by respiratory infections or environmental contaminants, among infants at risk for asthma [27]. Regarding SP-D, the SFTPD aa11-T allele was associated with severe RSV bronchiolitis [34], whereas the SFTPD aa11-C variant was associated with tuberculosis [30].",

            "text": "In sharp contrast to the potentially proinflammatory effects after PAMP recognition by collectins, mice deficient in SP-A or SP-D develop enhanced inflammatory pulmonary responses [35-37]. SP-A and SP-D play a dual role in the inflammatory response. They interact with pathogens via their CRD, and are recognized by calreticulin/CD91 on phagocytes through the N-terminal collagen domain, promoting phagocytosis and proinflammatory responses [10,13]. By contrast, binding of the CRD to signal inhibitory regulatory protein \u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1) on alveolar macrophages suppresses NF-\u03baB activation and inflammation, allowing the lung to remain in a quiescent state during periods of health [10]. A similar dual effect is observed in the promotion or inhibition of apoptosis [12]. SP-A and SP-D can also inhibit inflammation by blocking, through the CRD, Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 [38,39]. In agreement with previous results [16], we have observed that the SFTPD aa11-C allele associates with significantly lower SP-D serum levels than the aa11-T allele, and this effect was dose-dependent. The aa11-C/T SNP, located in the N-terminal domain, influences oligomerization of SP-D and explains a significant part of the heritability of serum SP-D levels [16,40]. Serum from aa11-C homozygotes lack the highest molecular weight (m.w.) forms of the protein, which binds preferentially to complex microorganisms whereas the low m.w. SP-D preferentially binds LPS [16].",

Residue 9, and frequently residue 19, is located in the signal peptide, and it is not know whether these variants may affect the function of the protein [14,44]. Alternatively all the missense variants could be in LD with SNPs in regulatory regions that might affect translation and RNA stability [51,52].",

However, the extent of oligomerization of SP-A, as well as the SP-A1/SP-A2 ratio, may be altered in various diseases and can vary among individuals [53,54]. The combination of both gene products may be important for reaching a fully native conformation [41]. In fact, it was recently shown that both SP-A1 and SP-A2 are necessary for the formation of pulmonar tubular myelin [55]. Therefore, the effect of a given haplotype may be largely influenced by haplotypes at the other gene. Our results suggest that the 6A2 to1A0 haplotype is more protective against CAP than both 6A2 and 1A0.",

A protective effect of the 6A2 to 1A0 haplotype was even higher when this haplotype co-segregates with the SFTPD aa11-C allele. Likewise, one haplotype containing 6A2-1A0 and the G allele of the SFTPD aa160 SNP could be protective against severe RSV disease [29]. Haplotypes at SFTPA1 are in LD with SFTPD aa11 in our population, but only a marginal LD between SFTPA2 and SFTPD aa11 was observed. In addition, no LD between 6A2 to A0 and SFTPD aa11 was found in controls (D' = 0.09) or CAP patients (D' = 0.024) in our study. These findings suggest that the protective effect of the co-segregation of SFTPD aa11-C with 6A2 to 1A0 on CAP susceptibility may rather reflect genetic interactions. Alternatively, the SFTPD aa11 SNP may be a marker of other SNPs in LD with SFTPA1 and SFTPA2. The gene of another collecting, the mannose-binding lectin (MBL), is located at 10q11.2-q21. We have previously observed that MBL deficiency predisposes to higher severity and poor outcome in CAP [56], and LD of the SP genes with MBL2 cannot be ruled out.",

SP-A levels are reduced in several pulmonary diseases [58-60]. SP-D may also be reduced in some patients with ARDS [59]. In Sftpa-/- and Sftpd-/- mice, intratracheally administered SP-A or SP-D can restore microbial clearance and inflammation [8,35]. Exogenous surfactant preparation containing the hydrophobic SP-B and -C are nowadays widely used for replacement therapies in infantile RDS. In addition, intratracheal instillation of recombinant SP-C reduced mortality in patients with severe ARDS due to pneumonia or aspiration [61]. Some of the genetic variants analyzed in our survey, such as 1A10, although rare, may have a high impact on susceptibility, severity and outcome of CAP. Validation of our results in other populations, and a better knowledge of the functional and clinical significance of the genetic variability at SFTPA1, SFTPA2 and SFTPD could be relevant for future investigations in the use of these collectins in the treatment of respiratory infectious diseases.",
