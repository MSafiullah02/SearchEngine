As a result, in 1988, Daniel M. Fox [1], Professor of Humanities in Medicine at the State University of New York, commented that the changes in the natural history of epidemics had become a topic exclusively of historical interest. However epidemics since, and now Covid-19, show this to have been a false hope.",

In 1665 Thomas Sydenham abandoned London when it was being devastated by the plague [2]. The Physician was the top of the professional hierarchy. If he remained in the city, he would send a surgeon (a practitioner of lower rank) to visit the sick. The surgeon would describe the symptoms through the window of the house and the Physician would pronounce his opinion and prescribe the treatment [2].",

The doctor, recruited on these occasions, became an important person. The authorities provided doctors with protective measures such as spongia olfacienda and clothing treated with aromatic substances. They had particularly attractive contracts. In Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales the very learned doctor \u201ckept what he had gained during the plague, because gold in medicine is a cordial. That\u2019s why he loved gold so much\u201d [3].",

It offers the opportunity to reflect on the obligations of the doctor (and nowadays other healthcare professionals) in times of epidemics: express consent, implicit consent, special training, reciprocity, codes and oaths. Doctors have a duty to treat the sick, at the cost of their lives. This was considered when HIV-AIDS first appeared. When it came under control the question returned to being purely \"academic\". However, with the advent of rapidly spreading infectious diseases, such as SARS, the Ebola virus, avian influenza, antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis, the speed of spread of an influenza outbreak showed that a virus has the potential to overwhelm and block an entire health system, creating unprecedented situations, in a way in which AIDS has never done [3].",
