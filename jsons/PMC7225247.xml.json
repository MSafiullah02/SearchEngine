In most cases, it is advisable to put any otology surgery on hold if the infection is not life threatening or expected morbidity is not significant. However, in some very specific and hopefully very rare situations where there is an emergency due to a complication of cholesteatoma, one might have to consider operating despite the COVID infection. This will undoubtedly complicate the perioperative course, pose diagnostic challenges and may potentially cause high mortality. It is, therefore, mandatory that any patient undergoing ear surgery be tested for COVID-19 preoperatively. Obviously, the treatment of cholesteatoma will also depend on the current phase of the pandemic in each country with respect to the availability of personnel and hospital infrastructure that remains available to treat cholesteatoma at any given time.",

            "text": "Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma entails extensive drilling (mastoidectomy), which is an aerosol-producing surgery. As the virus is also likely to reside in the middle ear mucosa, surgery of a patient with an active viral infection poses an immense risk to the surgical team [6]. Appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for this aerosol generating procedure is a N95 mask and face shield for all staff with surgery done in a theater with negative pressure atmosphere [7]. Enhanced PPE is ideal with a strong preference for use of powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) [7\u20139]. The procedure must be done preferably by an experienced surgeon and the number of personnel inside the theater must be restricted. A full visor and PPE will hinder the use of a microscope and surgery may have to be done with an endoscope or an exoscope with image viewed on a screen if available. The surgeon can use a N95 mask with goggles in case the use of the microscope is needed, and the microscope offers some degree of protection to the surgeon. A high-speed drill is also to be avoided but in emergencies may be done by reducing speed to decrease splashing or using curettes where possible as in a mastoid abscess. Any surgery in this situation without appropriate PPE will result in infections among the surgical team and is probably unwarranted. Availability of PPE is often a challenge even in the most well-equipped hospitals worldwide. Hence, we must consider the degree of urgency of the disease, the risk of the surgery, the risk of contamination of the healthcare team and the available resources (whether the hospital and resuscitation services are saturated or not) before scheduling a patient for surgery.",
