[1] [2] [3] [4] Due to the high mortality rate (up to 10%) SARS quickly became a global threat in 2003. [5, 6] Although about a year later from its first discovery the initial outbreak of the virus was stymied, the reemergence of SARS is quite possible and the development of new anti-SARS drugs is particularly important. [7, 8] The SARS CoV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Its genome is comprised of about 29700 nucleotides, most of them (over 21000 nucleotides) belongs to the replicase gene, which encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). The SARS CoV 3CL pro , a ~33 kDa cysteine protease, releases functional polypeptides from pp1a and pp1ab. Without these polypeptides the viral replication and transcription will be disabled. As the integral role of SARS CoV 3CL pro in SARS CoV lifecycle, it is an ideal target for drug discovery. [9] [10] [11] [12] Previously, a large number of SARS CoV 3CL pro inhibitors have been reported and their scaffolds are diverse. Yang et al. [6] developed a potent SARS CoV 3CL protease inhibitor (TG-0205221, Ki\uff1d50 nmol/L, Figure  1 ). Sydnes et al. [9] synthetized a series of glutamic acid and glutamine peptides possessing a trifluoromethyl ketone group with effective inhibitory activity. Zhou et al. [11] have reported 1-alkylisatin-5-carboxamide (IC 50 \uff1d0.37 \u03bcmol/L, Figure 1 ) and its analogues to be highly potent SARS CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. We identified novel SARS CoV 3CL pro inhibitors among a database containing more than 600000 compounds by virtual screening. Compound 1 (Figure 2) was selected, synthetized and tested against SARS CoV 3CL pro in vitro. 1 showed potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 \uff1d0.44 \u03bcmol/L) toward SARS CoV 3CL pro .

It is worth , it was about 9-fold higher potency than compound 11. The nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms are colored blue, red, and orange, respectively. Hydrogen bonds are displayed as blue dashed lines. Figure 3 showed docking model of compounds 1 and 23, from which we can conclude that compound 1 binds competitively and strongly to the active site, and the quinolinone portion was recognized by S1 pocket. Moreover, the thiophene moiety extends into S1' site with hydrophobic interactions. The S1' pocket is not quite large, this may explain why compounds 14 and 15 , with long carbon chain between the aromatic ring and ester carbonyl, show lower potency than compound 2. Unlike compound 1, methylation of the N-H of the quinolinone brings a different binding interaction, the thiophene moiety of compound 23 occupies S2 pocket, and the methyl group fills into the crack of S1 pocket closely. As S1' pocket is much nearer the surface of the protein than S2 pocket, the new binding model makes compound 23 bind more tightly than compound 1 with the protein. This may partly explain why compound 23 showed more potent inhibitory effect compared with compound 1. Molecular insight into the two different binding modes of compound 1 and 23 was shown in Figure 4 , the oxygen at C-2 of quinolinone moiety of compound 1 makes a H-bond with the NH of His 163 (1.78 \u00c5), and the NH of quinolinone forms a H-bond with Glu 166 (2.26 \u00c5). The ester carbonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the NH of Gly 143 (2.26 \u00c5). To compound 23, the hydro- gen bond of the amide carbonyl oxygen with the NH of His 163 (2.36 \u00c5) was also conserved as well. But there is no hydrogen bond with Glu 166, because of the methylation. The ester carbonyl oxygen of compound 23 makes hydrogen bonds with the active site residues, His 41 (3.36 \u00c5) and Cys 145 (2.23 \u00c5) . This is the most difference between the two binding modes. The active site of SARS CoV 3CL pro contains a catalytic dyad constituted by Cys 145 and His 41, which functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process. [11] That means that although the methylation disturbed the hydrogen bond of N-H of quinolinone, the distance between ester carbonyl oxygen and the S-H group of Cys 145 and N-H group of His 41 might be changed favorably resulting in dramatic inhibitory potency. In addition, the carbonyl of compound 23 may potentially react with the Cys 145 residue. This suppose remains to be further studied.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2271, "end": 2275, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 12, "end": 19, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 408, "end": 416, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1466, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Results and Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, twenty-three quinolinone compounds were synthesized and tested in vitro as inhibitors against SARS CoV 3CL pro .
