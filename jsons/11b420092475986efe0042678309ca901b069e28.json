The immunomodulatory mechanisms may be due to decreasing chemotaxis of neutrophils to lungs by inhibiting cytokines and formation of reactive oxygen species [16, 17] .

It is not having a direct lethal effect on viruses, but it was reported that viral respiratory infections in human beings are affected by the levels of vitamin C [20] .
