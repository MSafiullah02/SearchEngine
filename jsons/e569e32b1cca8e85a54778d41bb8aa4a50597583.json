The goal was two-fold\u2026to promote social distancing that slows the spread of the virus, and to preserve personal protective equipment and hospital resources, including ventilators and manpower. Consensus groups in both Europe and the U.S. provided guidance regarding the definition of \"essential\" surgery and proposed a \"tiered\" approach to surgical triage. 3 Although the application of these guidelines likely varied among countries and regions, there was near universal acceptance that radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, post-chemotherapy RPLND for testis cancer, partial or radical nephrectomy for clinical T2 renal cell cancer, and radical prostatectomy for high risk prostate cancer were \"essential.\" This is in addition to \"conventional\" urologic emergencies such as testicular torsion, Fournier\"s gangrene, symptomatic ureteral stones with hydronephrosis/sepsis, and the like. 4 In some institutions, a lack of viral prevalence and the availability of hospital resources (bed capacity and PPE) afforded the opportunity to address conditions to be considered of \"intermediate acuity\" including radical prostatectomy for intermediate risk prostate cancer, partial nephrectomy for clinical t1 renal cell cancers, and TURBT for small to medium nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers. The near-term goal of moving forward with Tier 2 operations was to avoid the potential for future increased morbidity/mortality and likewise to decompress the inevitable backlog of surgeries that we will all encounter when the imminent danger of COVID is over. 5 As many institutions prepare to broadly resume surgery for intermediate acuity and elective indications, universal testing of patients and providers will become necessary to ensure the mutual safety of both groups. 6 Ultimately, the decision to resume elective cases and/or to continue intermediate acuity cases must be individualized and is based on the rate of community transmission, the predicted need for institutional resources, and provider and patient preferences.",

Institution-specific protocols have been developed to help guide use of PPE and CMS (for the U.S.) has established a tiered approach for patient interactions. 13 At many institutions, low acuity inpatient consultations are being performed remotely with the explicit goal of simply finding an \"outpatient home.\" However, for those of us who continue to perform surgery for high and intermediate acuity indications, direct patient contact cannot be avoided and the risk of COVID exposure may be compounded.",

[14] [15] Such is the rationale for wearing a filtration mask during desiccation of penile viral warts, for instance. 16 This risk of viral contamination would apply to both open and minimally invasive approaches. And while the CDC states that SARS-CoV2 RNA has been detected in the blood and stool of infected patients, it remains unclear whether transmission can occur from contact during operative procedures as these are not considered \"high risk\" aerosol-generating procedures. It is likewise unclear (and unlikely) that transmissible SARS-CoV2 exists in the urine or semen. 17 The issue of safety during laparoscopic/robotic surgery is particularly germane as many of our intermediate and high acuity cases are performed in this manner, and some of our patients may be asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic carriers. There is thus far conflicting information regarding the potential of viral contamination during insufflation and/or with use of electrocautery or the harmonic scalpel. It is theorized that the evacuation of pneumoperitoneum and the aspiration of body fluids are \"aerosol generating procedures\" that could transmit viral particles. 18 The American College of Surgeons has gone so far as to recommend that we \"consider avoiding laparoscopy\". 19 Conversely, The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) stated that \"although previous research has shown that laparoscopy can lead to aerosolization of blood-borne viruses, there is no evidence to indicate that this effect is seen with COVID-19, nor that it would be isolated to MIS procedures.\" 20 They further suggested that laparoscopic surgery may actually offer better filtration of the majority of aerosolized particles as compared to open surgery. This \"closed system\" may therefore reduce the risk of viral contamination to operating rooms and personnel.",

Recommendations from the EAU regarding the temporary cessation of surgical training for fellows and residents should be interpreted with caution. 21 Ultimately, the ability to rapidly and reliably test patients preoperatively for COVID will assuage much of our collective anxieties, restore some sense of normalcy, and will embolden us to resume elective surgical procedures.
