The media from these cultures consistently produced colds in volunteers. The agent was ether sensitive but not related to any known human virus. Subsequently, electron microscopy of fluids from infected organ cultures revealed particles that resembled infectious bronchitis virus of chickens.9 At about the same time, Hamre and Procknow10 recovered a cytopathic agent in tissue culture from medical students with colds. The prototype virus was named 229E and was found on electron microscopy to have a similar or identical morphology (Fig. 157-1\n).9\n",

Through sequencing and antigenicity studies, the animal and human CoVs (HCoVs) initially were divided into three groups: group 1, which contained HCoV-229E, as well as numerous animal viruses; group 2, which contained HCoV-OC43 plus the closely related animal viruses, bovine CoV (BCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus; and group 3, which included only avian viruses related to infectious bronchitis virus (Fig. 157-2\n). Current taxonomy divides the subfamily Coronavirinae into four genera: Alphacoronavirus (which includes viruses previously in group 1); Betacoronavirus (which includes viruses previously in group 2, including SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV); Gammacoronavirus (which includes viruses previously in group 3); and Deltacoronavirus (which includes several newly described avian viruses).",

Notably, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were estimated to originate from a common precursor and diverge approximately 1000 years ago.25 HCoV-HKU1 was found in Hong Kong in an adult with respiratory disease. These two new HCoV strains subsequently have been found worldwide and appear to have pathogenicity similar to that of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, with the possible exception that NL63 is more frequently found in children with croup.26, 27\n",

The RNA, the largest known viral RNA (Fig. 157-3\n), codes for (in order from the 5\u2032 end) a large polyprotein that is cleaved by virus-encoded proteases to form several nonstructural proteins, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, methyltransferases, and a helicase, followed by either four or five structural proteins intermingled with a variable number of nonstructural and minor structural proteins.37 The first of the major structural proteins is a surface hemagglutinin-esterase protein, present on HCoVs OC43 and HKU1 and some animal betacoronaviruses, that may play some role in the attachment or release of the particle, or both, at the cell surface. This gene contains sequences similar to the hemagglutinin of influenza C virus, likely evidence of an interfamily recombinational event that occurred many years ago. The next gene encodes the surface glycoprotein that forms the petal-shaped surface projections and is responsible for attachment and the stimulation of neutralizing antibody. This is followed by a small envelope protein, a membrane glycoprotein, and a nucleocapsid protein that is complexed with the RNA. There are several other open reading frames whose coding functions are not clear. The strategy of replication of CoVs is similar to that of other nidoviruses, in that all messenger RNAs form a nested set with common polyadenylated 3\u2032 ends, with only the unique portion of the 5\u2032 end being translated.4 As in other RNA viruses, mutations are common in nature, although the mutation rate is much lower, approximately 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 per site per replication cycle.38 Unlike other RNA viruses, CoVs encode a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease that has proofreading activities, playing a critical role in maintaining replication fidelity in cell cultures and in animals.39 CoVs are also capable of genetic recombination if two viruses infect the same cell at the same time.",

            "text": "The first report of a new CoV causing severe pneumonia appeared in ProMed Mail on September 20, 2012. A man from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia had developed pneumonia in June and died of respiratory and renal failure, and a virus was grown from a sputum sample that was subsequently sequenced and found to be a betacoronavirus thought at the time to be most closely related to bat CoVs HKU4 and HKU5.6 Between then and May 2014, a total of 537 cases occurred, all infected by this virus, now termed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). One hundred forty-five of the cases were fatal.7 More than 400 of these have been acquired and diagnosed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with most of the remainder in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, and Kuwait. Cases originating in the Arabian peninsula have also occurred in travelers to Egypt, Tunisia, Germany, Italy, Great Britain, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States, with a few secondary cases sometimes occurring in those locations through close family or hospital spread. In the United States,these include two unrelated MERS cases, and a third case related to one of these.61a While infections with severe respiratory involvement have occurred at all ages, the elderly and those with underlying conditions (diabetes, renal disease, immunosuppression) have been most often severely or fatally affected. The WHO and the CDC have published a case definition, as well as surveillance instructions to aid in epidemiologic control of the MERS-CoV.62, 63\n",

Serologic and virologic studies indicated that camels in the Middle East and Africa were frequently infected by viruses very similar to some of those found in human MERS cases.65a Acquisition of MERS from camels appears likely, although the proportion of camel-acquired cases (versus those acquired from person-to-person contact or through another animal intermediate) is not clear. Case clusters indicate that person-to-person hospital spread is more common than spread within families, and that casual-contact spread is unusual.7a\n",

These characteristics (infection without disease, coinfection during disease) are features of many respiratory pathogens, including particularly rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and parainfluenza viruses, but also (although less frequently) respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Because infections with respiratory HCoVs are so common, however, it is possible that they are responsible for a significant portion of these serious lower respiratory tract diseases, even though the basic pathogenicity of HCoVs (judging from volunteer studies) is similar to that of rhinoviruses, and clearly less than that of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, and certain adenovirus types. There is some evidence that HCoV-OC43 is more pathogenic in the elderly than HCoV-229E106 and also some evidence that infection with NL63 in children is different from the other respiratory HCoVs in that several series have found an excess of children with croup.26, 27\n",

The first two thirds of each genome encode replicase-associated genes. Gene 1 is translated as two large polyproteins, with the first expressed from ORF1a and the second from ORF1a/b following a \u22121 frameshift event. These polyproteins are then cleaved into individual proteins by two virus-encoded proteases. The major structural genes, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), surface (S), envelope (E), transmembrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, are indicated in green. The nonreplicase, accessory genes located at the 3\u2032 end of the genome are indicated with open boxes. The functions of these proteins are largely not known, and there is no sequence homology between accessory proteins of different coronaviruses. Some of these proteins are virion associated, but none are required for virus replication. The open reading frames (ORFs) encoding these proteins are numbered in order of appearance from the 5\u2032 end of the genome, with the exception that ns12.9 of HCoV-OC43.
