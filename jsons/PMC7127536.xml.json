The following suggestions address tertiary triage only, specifically, decisions regarding the delivery of critical care to any critically ill or injured patient during a pandemic or disaster and admission to ICUs. In resource-rich settings, tertiary triage decisions are only required in the event of a large surge of critically ill or injured casualties. In resource-limited settings, however, clinicians often are required to ration ICU resources under everyday9, 10, 11 circumstances, and hence, when a surge of critically ill patients occurs, the shortfall of resources and the degree of rationing is exacerbated.12 The suggestions offered refer to triage during surge events in both resource-rich and resource-poor settings rather than during long-term shortages of ICU resources.",

This approach acknowledges the variability required in conducting tertiary triage, depending on the context of the disaster (resource rich vs poor), the magnitude of the surge, the ethical perspective of the region, and the affected age-groups. Although most of the general principles apply to both adult and pediatric populations, some, such as excluding from critical care patients with a very low survival probability, will have a very different impact on the amount of resources required for an adult vs a child.13 The suggestions in this article are important for all involved in a pandemic or disaster with multiple critically ill patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. Although it is important for all providers to be familiar with all aspects of critical care triage, Table 1\nprovides an overview of the suggestions of most interest to each group.",

The panel reviewed previous task force suggestions14 and identified 17 key questions for which literature searches were conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made (e-Appendix 1). No studies of sufficient quality were identified upon which to make evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process.15 Suggestions from the previous task force that were not being updated were also included for validation by the expert panel.",

The task force considers all efforts at augmentation to include all attempts to acquire scarce critical resources or to transfer patients to other health-care facilities that are able to provide care (state, national, and even international partner institutions).19 In rapidly evolving disasters, critical care may need to be rationed before the appropriate authority has declared an emergency or activated its mass critical care plan, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, the relevant authority will be responsible for declaring an emergency and activating a mass critical care plan but may not have statutory powers. Nevertheless, a decision to ration critical care should not be made unilaterally at an institutional level because individual institutions do not possess the situational awareness in isolation to operationally or ethically justify such a decision. Similarly, the decision to cease triage should occur in a graduated and coordinated manner by altering the prioritization criteria and exclusion thresholds as resources become available.19\n",

Using a sole triage officer model allows for efficiency of decision-making, minimizes the impact on staff resources, and avoids conflicting opinions. However, a sole officer carries a significant intellectual and emotional burden. Furthermore, in situations with diverse groups of patients requiring critical care (eg, during a pandemic as opposed to a sudden static event), it is less likely that a very-well-defined set of criteria will exist to guide triage officers, and predicting patient outcomes will be more challenging. Therefore, in such settings, using a triage team comprising a senior intensivist and another senior physician from an acute care background may have advantages. This model ensures that at least two perspectives are provided on each case. Given the aim is to maximize the incremental benefit of critical care, the combination of an intensivist and a nonintensivist physician may be advantageous as one estimates the probability of good outcome with intensive care and the other without intensive care. Furthermore, a team approach may mitigate some of the emotional burden associated with sole decision-making. A team model, however, increases physician resources and requires processes to deal with disagreements within the team. Hospitals that choose to have a triage team must ensure that this approach does not compromise the ability to make effective and efficient decisions. Finally, it will likely be necessary for support staff (clinical and clerical) to be provided for the triage officers and teams.",

A number of prognostic scores have been developed for use in the critical care setting. We believe that for a prognostic score to be useful, it must reliably predict mortality, with an initial cutoff of > 90% mortality being reasonable to consider excluding a patient from admission to the ICU during a mass casualty event. Currently, there are no scores that meet these criteria. Previously, an admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of > 11 had been recommended as an exclusion criterion predicting significant mortality.7, 54, 55, 61, 62 However, some studies showed conflicting evidence regarding mortality rates associated with this threshold.60, 63, 64 Therefore, predictive ability of the SOFA score varies across populations and, hence, a specific SOFA score threshold cannot be recommended for use in all adult populations.

Similarly, the duration of the time period for reassessments (currently suggested as 72 h but as 96 h in prior publications) may need to be varied, depending on the natural history of the specific disease. In addition, instead of mortality prediction, a score may be more valuable if it predicts critical care resource utilization with a goal of maximizing the number of lives saved per available resource (Fig 5\n).

The magnitude of surge is illustrated by the alterations in the balance between demand (stick figures) and supply (medication boxes). As surge increases, the demand-supply imbalance worsens. Conventional, contingency, and crisis responses vary with magnitude of surge. Varying response strategies are associated with each level of response. As the magnitude of the surge increases, the response strategies used to cope gradually depart from the usual standard of care (default defining the standards of disaster care) until such point that even with crisis care, delivery of critical care is no longer possible.",

Secondary triage (2\u00b0) involves decisions regarding the priority for assessment and initial treatment of patients when they first arrive at the hospital (usually the ED). Tertiary triage (3\u00b0) involves decisions regarding the priority for definitive care of patients in the ICU or operating room. The degree to which the decisions at each stage involve resource allocation (rationing) in addition to prioritization depends on the degree of imbalance between the demand for and supply of resources. As one progresses from primary through secondary and tertiary triage, the information and data available on which to base the triage decisions increase but so too does the complexity of the decisions.
