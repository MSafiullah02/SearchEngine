The main causes of acute pancreatitis in adults are alcohol abuse and gallstones. In children, trauma is the main cause of pancreatitis.In general, the prognosis of acute pancreatitis in children is excellent. Pancreatitis is occasionally complicated by the formation of a pseudocyst, reported in 10\u201323% of cases of acute pancreatitis.Pancreatitis develops as a result of blockage or disruption of the collecting ducts and damage to the pancreatic acinar cells.This leads to activation and release of digestive enzymes.The activated enzymes autodigest the pancreatic parenchyma, causing inflammation and, potentially, necrosis.Localized collections of pancreatic secretions may become walled off by granulation tissue and form a pseudocyst either within the pancreatic tissue or immediately adjacent to it.Pancreatitis can be local or diffuse and classified as:AcuteChronicInheritedNecroticHemorrhagic\nAcute pancreatitis and trauma:The pancreas is divided up into head, body, and tail.The head is to the right of L2, the body overlies L1, and the tail rises up to the left of T12.The abdominal aorta and vena cava function to cushion the pancreas from injury against the vertebral bodies.However, with crushing or blunt abdominal trauma, the pancreas can be injured by compression against the vertebra.\n\n",

            "text": "\n\nPancreatic divisum\nis the most common congenital anomaly of the pancreas (Figs. 25.1 and 25.2).It occurs in approximately 7% of autopsy series (range: 1\u201314%) and as an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) finding in 4\u201325%.It is caused by failure of the ducts of the dorsal and ventral buds of the pancreas to fuse during embryologic development, at approximately the eighth intrauterine week of life.As a result, the accessory duct of Santorini derived from the dorsal bud drains the majority of the pancreas.Because the accessory duct is smaller in caliber than the duct of Wirsung, inadequate pancreatic drainage may result in chronic pain and recurrent pancreatitis.There are four varieties of pancreas divisum\n:\nClassic pancreas divisum: The small ventral duct, or duct of Wirsung, drains via the major papilla, and the large dorsal duct, or duct of Santorini, drains via minor papilla.\nIncomplete pancreas divisum: This is similar to the classic pancreas divisum, except a small branch connects the ventral and dorsal pancreas.\nPancreas divisum with nonpatent major papilla: The entire pancreatic ductal system drains via the minor papilla.\nReversed pancreas divisum: The small dorsal duct drains via minor papilla and the large ventral duct drains via major ampulla.\nPancreas divisum\nusually is a coincidental finding, and most individuals with this anomaly are asymptomatic.Pancreas divisum can present with pancreatitis or chronic abdominal pain.Pancreatitis in these patients can be acute, recurrent, or chronic.The symptoms of pancreatic divisum\nare probably due to high intrapancreatic dorsal ductal pressure caused by inadequate drainage and resistance to pancreatic secretion by the small minor papilla orifice, or due to intermittent obstruction by proteinaceous plugs of the draining minor papilla.ERCP is valuable to establish the diagnosis.The treatment of pancreas divisum\nis conservative.Patients with recurrent episodes of pancreatitis or chronic abdominal pain may benefit from intervention, which can be performed endoscopically or surgically.The aim is to relieve the papillary stenosis, and endoscopic intervention includes:Needle-knife sphincterotomy over a stentPull-type sphincterotomyEndoscopic stentingBalloon dilation of minor papilla\n\n",

The pancreatic pseudocyst is most often localized in the lesser sac behind the stomach.Exacerbation of pancreatitis may result in pancreatic necrosis, blood vessel occlusion, or disruption leading to hemorrhage, and systemic inflammatory response with multiorgan failure.Acute pancreatitis:This is characterized by enzymatic necrosis and inflammation of the pancreas.Focal areas of fat necrosis are interspersed with areas of interstitial hemorrhage secondary to destruction of blood vessels.In severe cases, large blue-black hemorrhagic foci are interspersed with yellow-white chalky areas of fat necrosis.\nChronic pancreatitis:This is characterized by irreversible destruction of the pancreatic parenchyma and subsequent replacement with fibrous tissue.Histologic features include intraglandular fibrosis, acinar cell destruction, lymphocytic infiltration, and pancreatic duct obstruction.The pancreatic ducts are dilated and obstructed with protein plugs in their lumens.Grossly, the gland is hard.\n\nPancreatic pseudocysts\n:These are localized collections of pancreatic secretions walled off by granulation tissue that lack a true epithelial lining (Fig. 25.3).The stomach, duodenum, small bowel, colon, or omentum may form part of the pseudocyst wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
