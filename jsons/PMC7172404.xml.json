            "text": "The Flaviviridae family includes three genera: flavivirus, hepativirus and pestivirus (Lindenbach and Rice, 2003). Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the major pathogens causing significant economic loss of cattle production and reproduction the world wide. As the prototype virus of the pestivirus genus, BVDV has a genome consisting of a single-stranded, positive-oriented RNA molecule of approximately 12.3 kb. BVDV, like other members in the flaviviridae family, contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that is flanked with a 5\u2032-nontranslated region (5\u2032-NTR) and a 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-NTR) and encodes a single polyprotein. The viral polyprotein is initiated cap-independently from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5\u2032-NTR and proteolytically cleaved to yield the viral proteins, specifically for BVDV, four structural proteins (core, Erns, E1 and E2) and at least seven nonstructural proteins (Npro, P7, NS2/3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (Lindenbach and Rice, 2003).",

            "text": "Unlike other species in flaviviridae family, pestiviruses share a unique proximal N-terminal leader autoproteinase, Npro. Npro is a cysteine proteinase which cleaves at its own C-terminal cysteine and serine dipeptide site to release the N-terminus of viral capsid (C) protein (Rumenapf et al., 1998, Stark et al., 1993). Other than this, Npro has not been found to be essential for viral replication (Fan and Bird, 2008a, Tratschin et al., 1998). Currently, whether or not this viral protein participates in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. However, recent evidence from both in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that pestivirus Npro is a pivotal factor in inhibiting the host innate immune system (Bauhofer et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2007, Gil et al., 2006, Hilton et al., 2006, Horscroft et al., 2005, La Rocca et al., 2005, Ruggli et al., 2005, Seago et al., 2007) and might be a critical determinant for the establishment of persistent fetal infection of BVDV (Meyers et al., 2007).",

Interestingly, numerous studies had showed that an additional HCV protein of approximately 16 kDa is biosynthesized from the initiator codon of the viral polyprotein sequence followed by a +1/\u22122 translational ribosomal frameshift operating in the region of core protein codons (Baril and Brakier-Gingras, 2005, Boulant et al., 2003, Choi et al., 2003, Cristina et al., 2005, McMullan et al., 2007, Rijnbrand et al., 2001, Varaklioti et al., 2002, Vassilaki and Mavromara, 2003, Walewski et al., 2001, Xu et al., 2001). Over the past few years, translational ribosome frameshift was also detected to exist in the replication of many members of flavivirus genus such as Dengue virus (Firth and Atkins, 2009, Firth et al., 2010), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (Melian et al., 2010), West Nile virus (Youn et al., 2010). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence so far to show that overlapping ORF exists in the life cycle of pestviruses.",

BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A was designed to express a chimeric eGFP2A protein that was introduced into viral polyprotein by replacing the whole Npro protein except its first 19 amino acids. The eGFP2A was created with a foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A protease (FMDV 2Apro) attached to C-terminus of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (Fig. 1A and B). This design assures the successful release of eGFP2A chimera from viral nascent polyprotein precursor by taking advantage of FMDV 2Apro protease activity (Fan and Bird, 2008a, Fan et al., 2008, Ryan and Drew, 1994, Ryan et al., 1991). During one of our attempts to optimize the assay, infectious viruses were rescued after MDBK cells were transfected with the run-off RNAs in vitro transcribed from pBSD1-Npro/eGFP2A (data not shown). RT-PCR of viral RNA using primer pair BVD424 and BVD1172 that target the viral Npro(1\u201319)/eGFP2A/C coding region (nt 390\u20131172, by reference to the nucleotides of BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A) identified a unique cDNA band of approximately 1.1 kb (Fig. 2A). Direct nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA products found a single cytosine nucleotide missing at nt 1044 (c1044\u0394) (Fig. 2B). Nucleotide sequencing did not find any other mutation(s) in viral genome of the rescued virus (Data not shown). These results reveal that a mutant viral genome is the solely infectious RNA molecule present in the infected MDBK cells. The acquired mutation of the mutant virus is located in the 3\u2032-end of the viral eGFP region. Here, we name the rescued mutant virus as BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-c1044\u0394.",

            "text": "Nucleotide sequence analysis shows that mutation c1044\u0394 causes a frameshift with the formation of a premature stop codon (TGA at nt 1069\u20131071) in eGFP coding region, 54 nucleotides before the FMDV 2Apro sequence (Fig. 3\n). The appearance of this stop codon in the original viral 0/0 ORF of BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-c1044\u0394 is supposed to direct the generation of an unstable, fluorescence-deficient variant of eGFP protein that is C-terminal 18-AA truncated (Dopf and Horiagon, 1996) and no viable viruses should be generated (Fig. 3). Based on this observation, we postulated that BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-c1044\u0394 can be rescued only through a \u22121/+2 ORF that must exist and initiate in the coding region of either Npro(1\u201319) or eGFP. Furthermore, it is obvious that, no matter which coding region this event falls in, a functional eGFP protein is not supposed to be produced. As expected, different from BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-infeced MDBK cells that showed a time-dependent, rapid elevation of green fluorescent protein as measured by a combination of fluorescence microscopy (FM), FACS and western blotting at 12, 36, and 60 h post infection (p.i.) (Fig. 4A\u2013C) (Fan et al., 2008), MDBK cells infected with BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-c1044\u0394 did not show any fluorescence signal as determined by both IFM and FACS as checked at all three time points (Fig. 4A and B). In addition, green fluorescent protein was not detectable in the mutant virus-infected cells as checked in a time-course western blotting assay (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these data conclusively reveals the existence of an additional ORF in viral Npro(1\u201319)/eGFP region.",

Together with pBSD1-Npro/eGFP2A (Fan and Bird, 2008a), three constructs represent 0/0, \u22121/+2, and +1/\u22122 frames, respectively (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, focus forming assay indicated that infectious viruses (passage 0) were successfully rescued from the transcripts derived from pBSD1-Npro/eGFP2A and pBSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-1 but not from pBSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-2. After five additional blind passages in MDBK cells with the culture supernatant, the rescued mutant virus was confirmed to be deficient in GFP generation as assayed with a western blotting assay (Fig. 5C). The Npro(1\u201319)/eGFP2A/C coding sequence was stably retained in viral genomes as analyzed with RT-PCR of viral RNA extracted from the viruses both at passage 5 (Fig. 5D). Nucleotide sequencing of the RT-PCR products demonstrated that the rescued viruses retain the original nucleotide sequence of the Npro(1\u201319)/eGFP2A/C region as engineered (Fig. 5E). These results confirmed our observation that an additional ORF exists in the viral Npro(1\u201319)/eGFP region. Furthermore, these data indicates that it is a \u22121/+2 ORF but not a +1/\u22122 ORF that exists during viral replication, initiates in viral Npro(1\u201319)/eGFP coding region, and alternatively directed the rescue of BVDV mutant BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A-c1044\u0394.",

BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A is characteristic of a disrupted Npro protein (Npro1\u201319) with its most C-terminal amino acids replaced with a reporter protein chimera, eGFP2A. The eGFP2A chimera was designed to consist of eGFP and FMDV 2A protease in such a way that eGFP2A can be cleaved from the viral precursor polyprotein of BSD1-Npro/eGFP2A and can be maintained stably in infected-MDBK cells (Fan and Bird, 2008a, Fan et al., 2008). Failure to obtain such a recombinant virus in one of our attempts showed us a very interesting phenomenon. Namely, infectious viruses were indeed obtained, however green fluorescent protein was not detectable. Direct nucleotide sequencing identified a cytosine nucleotide missing at nt 1044 (c1044\u0394) of the genome of the rescued virus. Since the mutation causes a frameshift with formation of a premature stop codon (TGA at nt 1069\u20131071) in C-terminal eGFP about 18 AA before FMDV 2Apro a C-terminal 18 amino acid-truncated eGFP protein are supposed to be translated from the original viral 0/0 ORF. This finding explained why functional GFP protein was not detectable in this case because C-terminal truncation of even 6 amino acids already results in a complete fluorescence loss of the mutant GFP protein (Dopf and Horiagon, 1996). It is interesting to see that the mutant GFP protein was even not detected in the western blotting assay. This happened probably due to the fact that the antibody applied in the assay cannot recognize the C-terminal 18 AA truncated mutant GFP protein. We actually tested several other commercially available anti-GFP antibodies and they all failed to detect the mutant GFP protein.",

It was already known that ribosome skipping is actively promoted by FMDV 2Apro sequence and insertion of this small sequence in viral genome leads to the efficient release of its downstream protein (Donnelly et al., 2001, Funston et al., 2008). However, in this specific case, the involvement of FMDV 2Apro sequence in directing the generation of viable viruses is immediately excluded. The reason is simply due to the occurrence of a premature stop codon 54 nt upstream of the FMDV 2Apro coding region in mutant viral genome. Following the original viral 0/0 ORF of the mutant viral genome, the protein translation is already ceased even before the ribosome can reach the FMDV 2A coding region to perform the ribosome skipping event. Considering that viral capsid protein is essential for formation of infectious viruses and must be synthesized first and then released from the viral polyprotein catalyzed by the 17 AA FMDV 2Apro it is reasonable to postulate that an alternative \u22121/+2 ORF exists in the viral genome and this event must occur before the coding sequence of FMDV 2Apro, namely in the Npro(1\u201319)/eGFP coding region. By using our BAC-based reverse genetics system we find out that this event operating occurs in the Npro(1\u201319) region of the native BVDV SD-1, suggesting that the \u22121/+2 ORF of the viral genome probably has nothing to do with the heterologous eGFP insertion or FMDV 2Apro sequence but seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of the native virus. The rescued virus is much lower than its parent virus in viral RNA, viral protein, and virus titer, indicating that the \u22121/+2 ORF of BVDV has a much lower efficacy than the original viral 0/0 ORF in viral protein translation.",

Several following studies confirmed this observation and further showed that an additional HCV ORF overlaps the core gene in the +1 frame (core +1 ORF) (Choi et al., 2003, Roussel et al., 2003, Varaklioti et al., 2002, Walewski et al., 2001, Xu et al., 2001). This polypeptide can be synthesized in vitro from the initiator codon of the viral polyprotein sequence followed by a +1 translational ribosome frameshift operating occurring in the coding region of core codons 8\u201314 (Vassilaki et al., 2008). Circulating anti-core +1 antibodies have been detected in HCV-infected individuals, suggesting that this protein is produced during natural HCV infection (Choi et al., 2003, Roussel et al., 2003, Varaklioti et al., 2002, Walewski et al., 2001, Xu et al., 2001). These data together show that, besides its role in viral assembly, the core protein of HCV might play a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis (Brierley, 1995, Futterer et al., 1993, Jayakar and Whitt, 2002, Kobayashi et al., 2000, Latorre et al., 1998, Pavlakis and Felber, 1990, Stacey et al., 2000). In most recent years, researchers observed that translational ribosome frameshift event also exists in many other flaviviridae family viruses such as Dengue virus (Firth and Atkins, 2009, Firth et al., 2010), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (Melian et al., 2010) and West Nile virus (Youn et al., 2010). Although we cannot determine with current available evidence that BVDV exhibits a translational frameshift event during its replication, it is possible that translational ribosome frameshift for gene expression is probably a common strategy that is applied by many virus members of all three genera in flaviviridae family to synthesize more viral proteins with their limited genetic materials. Specifically for BVDV SD-1, however, we noticed that an additional \u22121/+2 ORF in Npro(1\u201319) region causes the generation of a peptide with a maximum size of 29 amino acids (data not shown). If there exists a translational ribosome frameshift site or an internal translational initiation site in the Npro(1\u201319) region and the biological relevance of this additional \u22121/+2 ORF during BVDV life cycle needs to be carefully investigated in the future.",

(C) After the rescue of BSD1-g442\u0394 (passage 0), the viruses were passaged additional six times in MDBK cells. The virus titer was determined for each passage and virus titer curve was generated by plotted against virus passage number. The graph shows average values derived from three independently generated experiments. (D) MDBK cells were infected with either BSD1 or BSD1-g442\u0394 at an MOI of either 1.0 FFU/cell or 0.1 FFU/cell. At various time points p.i. as indicated, virus titers were determined. Viral growth curves were generated by plotted against time. Here, BSD1 and BSD1-g442\u0394 were designated by empty and solid circles, respectively. The graph shows average values derived from three independently generated experiments. (E) Viral RNA genome was quantitatively measured in a time-course manner. MDBK cells were infected with BSD1 or BSD1-g442\u0394. Cells were harvested at indicated time points p.i., total cellular RNA was isolated and quantified as described above in quantitative RT-PCR. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments. (F) Accumulation of intracellular viral E2 protein of BSD1-g442\u0394 as compared to that of BSD1. Virus- and mock-infected MDBK cells were treated as described above. Accumulation of viral E2 protein was reflected by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the E2-positive cells and is indicated in the plot. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments.",
