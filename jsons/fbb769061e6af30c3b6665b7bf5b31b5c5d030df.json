The 2009 H1N1/2009pdm 'swine flu' pandemic reinforced the need for innovation in pandemic vaccine design. We report on insights gained during rapid development of a pandemic vaccine based on recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) formulated with Advax TM delta inulin adjuvant (Panblok-H1/Advax). Panblok-H1/Advax was designed and manufactured within 1 month of the pandemic declaration by WHO and successfully entered human clinical testing in under 3 months from first isolation and sequencing of the novel pandemic virus, requiring several major challenges to be overcome. Panblok-H1/Advax successfully induced neutralising antibodies against the pandemic strain, but also induced cross-neutralising antibodies in a subset of subjects against an H1N1 strain (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) derived from the 1918 Spanish flu, highlighting the possibility to use Advax to induce more broadly cross-protective antibody responses. Interestingly, the rHA from H1N1/2009pdm exhibited variants in the receptor binding domain that had a major impact on receptor binding and hemagglutination ability. We used an in silico structural modeling approach to better understand the unusual behavior of the novel hemagglutinin, thereby demonstrating the power of computational modeling approaches for rapid characterization of new pandemic viruses. While challenges remain in ensuring ultrafast vaccine access for the entire population in response to future pandemics, the adjuvanted recombinant Panblok-H1/Advax vaccine proved its utility during a real-life pandemic situation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines have traditionally been made from inactivated virus grown in embryonated eggs. However, this approach has several limitations including manufacturing delays while vaccine seed viruses are eggadapted and insecurity of egg supply with potential of supply disruption if pandemic virus also infects chicken flocks. Eggbased vaccines may also not be suitable for individuals with severe egg allergies. 1 Despite more recent development of large-scale facilities for mammalian cell culture of influenza virus, 2 this remains susceptible to delays while seed viruses suitable for cell culture are generated and screened. The predictability and speed of recombinant protein manufacture are major advantages for vaccine production. A potentially more reliable approach to pandemic vaccine production, therefore, is the use of recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA). Protective neutralising antibodies to HA are seen after influenza infection or immunization. 3, 4 The US government awarded contracts to a range of vaccine companies including Protein Sciences Corporation (PSC), Medicago, Novovax, Fraunhofer Institute, and Vaxinnate to produce recombinant influenza vaccines using various techniques. 5 PSC pioneered the use of the baculovirus expression system to produce influenza vaccine based on rHA (Flublok \u00d2 ), which was licensed by the FDA in 2013 for seasonal influenza protection in adults. 6 The pandemic variant of this rHA vaccine is known as Panblok \u00d2 . While Panblok protected birds against lethal H5 or H7 infection, 7 only low levels of seroprotection were obtained in human subjects indicating the need for an adjuvant. 8 While many adjuvants have been described, very few have progressed as formulations for licensed human vaccines. 9 Advax TM is a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on particles of semi-crystalline delta inulin, development of which was supported through the US. National Institutes of Health's Adjuvant Development Program. 10 In animal models, Advax TM adjuvant has been shown to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines against a wide range of diseases including influenza, [11] [12] [13] hepatitis B, 14 SARS coronavirus, 15 Japanese encephalitis, 16 West Nile virus, 17 RSV, 18 anthrax, 19 Listeria, 20 HIV 21 and Peste de petit ruminants. 22 Although its mechanism of action has yet to be fully determined, Advax particles bind directly to human monocytes and enhance their co-stimulatory function. 23 In a pandemic influenza study in the ferret model, Advax significantly enhanced protection afforded by an inactivated H5N1 vaccine providing 100% survival versus only 66% survival seen with the standard H5N1 vaccine alone. 24 The vaccine with Advax adjuvant provided over 3-fold antigen dose-sparing while significantly reducing neurologic disease and viral shedding.

Some degree of pre-existing immunity was seen in older adults especially those aged over 60, possibly due to previous exposure to antigenically related influenza A viruses. Recent seasonal influenza vaccines (2005-2009 provided minimal protection against the novel pandemic strain. 29 While the 2009 pandemic was not as severe as initially feared, it did cause an upsurge in hospital and intensive care unit admissions for severe respiratory illness, hypoxemia, multi-organ failure and requirement for ventilator support. 30 Given the need for rapid development of pandemic vaccines, a variety of approaches were utilised involving inactivated and live attenuated vaccines. We used an alternative approach to develop a vaccine using recombinant hemagglutinin from H1N1/2009pdm combined with Advax delta inulin adjuvant (Panblok-H1/Advax vaccine). 26 As described below, novel insights were obtained during the process of developing Panblok-H1/Advax and moving it as rapidly as possible to human clinical trials.

Although this strain subsequently provided unsatisfactory egg production yields delaying vaccine manufacture while an alternative higher-yield strain was identified, PSC had already cloned the HA from the A/California/04/2009 virus RNA as a template using a reverse transcriptase PCR reaction (RT-PCR) to generate cDNA which was cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector and then used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda (expres SFC TM ) (SFC) insect cells using calcium phosphate precipitation with linearized Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The clones were sequenced to compare their sequence to the published CDC A/H1N1/California/04/2009 HA sequence but no perfect match was found, a situation that is not uncommon in initial cloning of seasonal influenza strains. Several clones had a Proline at position 200 (Pro 200 ) in the HA1 domain, a variant that also appears in other H1N1 viruses (Supplementary Figure 1) . Position 200 in the HA1 domain maps near the distal tip involved in receptor binding according to the predicted HA crystal structure (Supplementary Figure 2 At the time of the pandemic declaration, minimal information was available on the new pandemic virus to help inform vaccine design.

To better understand the unusual behavior of the A/California/04/2009 virus and, in particular, the differences in behavior of the Pro 200 vs. Ser 200 rHA, we generated a homology model of A/California/04/2009 HA using Modeler, a homology modeling program, using a crystal structure of an earlier HA protein, 3AL4.pdb, as a template. This was then used to conduct receptor binding analysis using the molecular docking program, Autodock vina, with binding energies of the Pro 200 vs. Ser 200 rHA calculated for both avian and human sialic acid receptors. These binding studies confirmed that the Pro 200 !Ser 200 substitution had a significant impact on the predicted binding conformation of the HA head region to avian and human sialic acid receptors (Fig. 1, top panels) (Fig. 1 , bottom panels). Since Ser 200 is located above the H 192 that forms the base of the pocket, H-bonding between Ser 200 and sialic acid prevents the receptor contacting the base of the binding pocket and interacting with H 192 . This may cause the HA to bind its receptor with a reduced affinity. Furthermore, since the receptor is not entering deep into the binding pocket, entry of water will hydrate potential contact sites and further reduce the stability of the interaction. In contrast, Pro 200 loses the H-bonding ability of this position with sialic acid and as a result the receptor can now form H-bonds with the base of the pocket (H 192 and Y 104 ). Furthermore, since the receptor is now capable of entering deep into the pocket potential hydration of H-bonding sites is avoided and this may result in a more stable binding of the Pro 200 HA with its receptor.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 170, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 171, "end": 173, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1018, "end": 1038, "text": "(Fig. 1, top panels)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1039, "end": 1046, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Cloning of rHA from H1N1/2009pdm"}, {"text": "Given its inability to induce agglutination activity in vitro, in vivo studies were considered necessary to identify whether or not the Ser 200 Panblok-H1 antigen would induce neutralising antibodies that could protect against H1N1/ 2009pdm infection.

Despite the Ser 200 rHA antigen having no agglutination activity in vitro, when used to immunise mice it still induced antibodies ( Fig. 2) able to neutralise the agglutination activity of the Pro 200 rHA variant which retained agglutination activity as well as the agglutination activity of a local pandemic virus isolate named SF3 strain that was characterized as an A/California/07/2009-like virus.

The isolate was propagated in MDCK cells and the HA gene sequenced and confirmed to match the published H1N1/ 2009pdm sequence.

While it would have been preferable to use the rHA vaccine antigen itself for the assays, the reference Ser 200 rHA antigen, as described above, had no agglutination activity against either chicken or guinea pig RBC. Surprisingly, the 2 variant rHA sequences produced during the initial baculovirus cloning that contained Pro 200 in the receptor-binding site did have potent RBC agglutination activity. To assess its suitability for use as an antigen in HI assays, we tested the Pro 200 rHA for recognition by a reference ferret hyperimmune sera to A/California/07/ 2009 (BEI No. NR-15429, NIH). Pro 200 rHA gave the correct HA titer (1:5000), indicating that it contained an equivalent agglutination epitope to wild type H1N1/2009pdm virus. When a monovalent inactivated A/California/07/2009 vaccine (Panvax, CSL Australia) became available this was also used to conduct HI assays in parallel with the SF3 and Pro 200 rHA antigens. HI titres were measured by HI assay using guinea pig RBC, as described previously. 33 At study baseline, when using the SF3 antigen for the HI assays, only 9.1% of study subjects had HI titres 40, suggesting a low level of pre-existing immunity to H1N1/2009pdm in the South Australian population at the time of study commencement. As previously reported, HI assay results are highly dependent on both the actual HA antigen as well as the species of RBC used, making international standardisation of such assays problematic. High inter-assay variability may help explain the markedly different baseline estimates of H1N1/ 2009pdm seroprotection reported by various laboratories around the world. Indeed, we obtained different estimates of baseline seroprotection rates in our study population depending on which HA antigen we used for the HI assays. The lowest baseline seroprotection estimate for the HI assays were obtained when using the SF3 antigen, then inactivated A/California/07/2009 grown in eggs, and with the highest estimate obtained using the Pro 200 rHA (data not shown). Importantly, while the different HA antigens provided different estimates of baseline seroprotection, the fold-change in pre-to post-immunisation HI titers in study subjects was highly correlated between the 3 different HA antigens (data not shown). Given the differences in HI results obtained using the 3 different H1N1/2009pdm HA antigens, we reported the study using the SF3 virus antigen. 34 Three weeks after a single rHA immunization, the highest responders were younger subjects who received the highest rHA dose together with Advax adjuvant who had a seroprotection rate of 80% with SF3 as antigen for the HI assay. Given the difficulties of comparing HI assay results between studies, we compared results from the FLU005 study to convalescent sera from hospital patients recovering from H1N1/2009 infection. 35 This confirmed that subjects that received Panblok-H1 with Advax adjuvant had comparable or higher HI titres than patients recovering from H1N1/2009pdm infection. 34 Microneutralization (MNT) assays test the ability of immune sera to prevent live influenza virus from infecting cell lines, in vitro. They thereby measure a broader array of neutralising antibodies than HI assays, which just measure the ability to block binding of HA to sialic acid. In addition to HI activity, MNT assays detect antibodies that block other vital virus functions including fusion and nucleic acid unwrapping. 36 HI and MNT results were compared at baseline and post the second immunisation in the groups that received 45mg Panblok-H1 with or without Advax adjuvant. At baseline, most samples had low or undetectable HI titres, although many were positive by the MNT assay, indicating the HI assay had a lower sensitivity than the MNT assay. There was consequently only a very weak correlation between baseline HI and MNT results in each individual ( Fig. 3A) , with many subjects with undetectable HI titres having positive MNT titres against H1N1/2009pdm. This suggests that MNT can identify subjects who despite being negative by HI nevertheless have seroprotective levels of neutralising non-HI antibodies. Interestingly, post-immunization there was a much stronger positive correlation between HI and MNT levels in each subject (Fig. 3B) , suggesting the vaccine induced similar proportions of both HI and MNT antibodies. Advax adjuvant had equally favorable effects on both HI and MNT responses with the mean fold increase in HI and MNT being \u00bb2-3-fold higher when compared with Panblok-H1 alone. 34 To test the ability of the Panblok-H1/Advax to induce broadly neutralising antibodies against other influenza strains, HI and MNT assays were also performed against the historic H1N1 strain, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/PR8) and the H3N1 strain, A/Hong Kong/1/68 x A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A/X31). The MNT assay detects neutralising antibodies targeting the HA stem that thereby neutralise both homologous and heterologous strains, 36 whereas HI assays only detect neutralising antibodies directed against the HA head and hence are specific to homologous virus. As expected from the differences in the sequences of the HA head region, FLU005 study subjects showed no increase in HI against heterologous A/PR8 or A/X31 viruses, post-immunization (Fig. 4, left side) . However, the more sensitive MNT assay revealed seroconversion to A/PR8 in \u00bb2/5 th of subjects in the Panblok-H1/Advax group vs. \u00bb1/6 th of subjects in the Panblok-H1 alone group (Fig. 4, right side) . Given the lack of detectable HI to A/PR8 in these subjects, this suggests the MNT assay was detecting other types of neutralising antibodies such as those that target the HA stem region. HA stem antibodies are difficult to induce so it will be interesting in future to confirm whether Advax-adjuvanted rHA is able to induce broadly neutralising stem antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1199, "end": 1201, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2595, "end": 2597, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3019, "end": 3021, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 3185, "end": 3187, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3614, "end": 3616, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 4707, "end": 4709, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 5130, "end": 5132, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4055, "end": 4063, "text": "Fig. 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 4437, "end": 4446, "text": "(Fig. 3B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 5443, "end": 5462, "text": "(Fig. 4, left side)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 5643, "end": 5663, "text": "(Fig. 4, right side)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Assessment of vaccine efficacy"}, {"text": "We next assessed the effect of subject age on antibody levels.

A seasonal vaccine (Flublok \u00d2 ) based on insectcell expressed rHA was at the time of the 2009 pandemic still awaiting FDA approval but has since been licensed in the USA for use in adult subjects. 2009 presented a rare opportunity to test this novel rHA vaccine technology in the context of a reallife pandemic. The baculovirus expression technology used to produce Panblok-H1/Advax was extremely fast as it avoided the need for creation of egg-or cell culture adapted influenza viruses. Indeed, development of Panblok-H1/Advax was performed in just 3 months from initial virus identification to first human trial dose administered, making this potentially one of the fastest vaccine development programs in history. Surprisingly, when rHA was expressed from the initial CDC recommended A/California/04/2009 reference sequence it did not show any agglutination activity. This is not a unique occurrence as one of the complexities of the study of influenza viruses is that some variants have limited receptor recognition, with several alternative structural mechanisms existing for adaptation of binding properties and with a broad range of HA residues having the ability to influence receptor binding. Furthermore, as the ability of HA to agglutinate RBC relies on its ability to multimerize we speculate that another potential reason for the failure of the Ser 200 rHA to agglutinate RBC could be that this variant failed to assemble properly in HA timers and rosettes needed for agglutination activity. Hence, it had both a lower avidity for sialic acid receptors but also was unable to crosslink them to induce RBC agglutination. The CDC subsequently issued a different vaccine seed strain, A/California/07/2009, which was later used in manufacture of inactivated H1N1/2009 vaccines, and also by PSC in manufacture of a A/California/07/2009 rHA for inclusion in their 2010 and subsequent year seasonal trivalent Flublok vaccines. Ironically during original mnufacture the A/California/04/2009 rHA gene had spontaneously reverted during cloning to Pro 200 sequences with agglutination activity but following the procedure used for seasonal influenza vaccine manufacture, the HA sequence was mutated back to the CDC A/California/04/2009 Ser 200 reference sequence which had the agglutination problem. Imposing a further delay on vaccine delivery was the requirement for a 29-day mycoplasma culture to allow lot release. In future, it should be possible to use the FDA-approved 14-day PCR mycoplasma assay thereby removing 2 weeks from the time needed for vaccine release. Nevertheless, despite these challenges Panblok/Advax was the first H1N1/2009 vaccine in the world to become available for clinical testing, and in the FLU005 trial was confirmed to be immunogenic, safe and well tolerated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Interestingly, depending on which antigen was used for HI assays, slightly different estimates were obtained for baseline seroprotection levels in the study population. We reported the study results using the wild-type SF3 virus, an A/California/07/ 2009-like virus isolated from a local patient with pandemic influenza. This may have understated the overall seroprotection levels reported for Panblok-H1/Advax relative to other reported vaccines. Furthermore, whereas many other pandemic vaccine studies included mainly young healthy subjects, our study included an extremely high proportion of elderly, obese and chronic disease subjects and this likely negatively impacted on our overall seroprotection levels. Subjects over 50 y of age have been reported elsewhere to have lower influenza vaccine responses. 37, 38 Hence direct comparisons are difficult of HI titers between different studies with results being highly dependent on the assay and antigen used. 39 Furthermore, seroprotection rates measured by HI assay likely understate total protection particularly when compared with MNT assays. MNT assays provide a more sensitive measure of seroprotection given their ability to also detect antibodies that target other important viral epitopes such as the stem region involved in viral fusion. 40 The H1N1/2009pdm MNT assay provided a much higher estimate of baseline immunity to H1N1/2009pdm across the study population, as many subjects that had a negative HI were seropositive by MNT assay. Advax adjuvant induced a \u00bb3-fold increase in MNT tters vs. \u00bb2-fold higher titers by HI assay. While the HI assay did not detect any vaccine effects on heterologous antibodies against the A/PR8 or A/X31 virus strains, the more sensitive MNT assay showed that Panblok-H1/Advax induced seroconversion against A/PR8 in \u00bb2/5 th of the trial subjects. This raises the possibility that Panblok-H1/Advax induced HA stem antibodies in some subjects. As stem antibodies confer broad cross-protection against heterologous influenza viruses, this will be an important area for future study. The ability of Advax adjuvant to induce broader cross-protective responses has been seen in animal studies where formulation of an inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus antigen with Advax resulted in robust cross-protection against heterologous flaviviruses including Murray Valley Encephalitis and West Nile virus. 17 This enhanced protection was transferrable from immunised to na\u20ac \u0131ve mice using memory B cells, suggesting Advax enhances production of broadly cross-protective memory B cells. Recent human influenza studies showed that subjects that received Advax-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine had a higher day 7 post-immunisation plasmablast responses and enhanced expression of activationinduced cytidine deaminase translating into greater antibody avidity and CDR3 complexity. 41 Advax has been shown in animal models to be a potent inducer of memory CD4 C and CD8 C T cells. 13 One important aspect that was not able to be addressed in our study was whether Panblok-H1/Advax also enhanced human T-cell immunity against influenza. CD4 C T cells have recently been shown to make an important contribution to human influenza protection. 41 Future studies will be needed to identify whether better immune correlates of influenza protection can be found to supplement or replace the information provided by HI assays.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 812, "end": 815, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 816, "end": 818, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 964, "end": 966, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1304, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2401, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2878, "end": 2880, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2977, "end": 2979, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3236, "end": 3238, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While the merits of adding adjuvants to seasonal influenza vaccines has been widely debated, studies of H5N1 vaccines have demonstrated the vital importance of adjuvants for high levels of seroprotection. 42 The reason why seasonal vaccines generally do not require adjuvants is that most people have already been primed by past seasonal influenza infections with related strains. Furthermore, inactivated virus vaccines contain contaminants including viral RNA and neuraminidase and nuclear protein that act as inbuilt adjuvants. 43 Inactivated influenza vaccines lose their immunogenicity when administered to toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 knockout mice, thereby demonstrating the importance of viral RNA to innate immune activation and vaccine immunogenicity. 44 Panblok-H1 alone or together with Advax adjuvant was very well tolerated. The most common local reaction was injection site discomfort with other local reactions such as bruising, redness, and swelling with most of local reactions being low grade. Surprisingly, postimmunisation headaches were significantly lower in subjects that received Advax adjuvant (2.9%) compared with Panblok-H1 alone (10.9%), suggesting the Advax adjuvant suppressed immunisation headaches though a currently unidentified mechanism. 34 While adjuvants were ultimately not essential for immunogenicity of A/California/07/2009 vaccines, this was a rare exception as vaccines against high-pathogenicity avian influenza strains such as H5N1 or H7N9 have clearly shown adjuvants are needed for adequate seroprotection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 207, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 531, "end": 533, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 760, "end": 762, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1274, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Very little time is available for vaccine design when the world is faced with a real-life pandemic given the exceptional rates of virus spread.

This was highlighted by the problems of the A/California/04/2009 reference sequence, with the rHA from this sequence having no agglutination activity. While this problem was ultimately solved by the more representative A/California/07/2009 strain, this caused time delays due to the problems with vaccine manufacture.

In fact, there was an extremely low 3.9% rate of late H1N1/2009pdm seroconversion between weeks 6 and 26, suggesting most of subjects were protected during the peak period of the pandemic when the pandemic virus was widely circulating in the community. It would also have been useful to do a direct comparison within the study between the immunogenicity of the Advax-adjuvanted recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine and a commercial inactivated virus vaccine, but this was not possible as at the time that the FLU005 study commenced, no pandemic vaccine based on inactivated virus was yet available.

To ensure 100% consistency with the CDC published sequence of A/California/04/2009 (Acc# FJ966082) that had a Serine at position 200 (Ser 200 ), site directed mutagenesis was performed on the baculovirus clones to change the Pro 200 to a Ser 200 . Both Pro 200 and Ser 200 rHA protein variants were then manufactured so that their behavior could be studied. Hemagglutination activity assays were performed with fresh chicken and swine red blood cells (RBCs). With chicken RBCs, the undiluted Ser 200 rHA monovalent bulk only had a hemagglutination titer of 3, equivalent to 0.07 Units/mg HA protein, indicating a exceptionally low agglutination activity. By comparison, 1 mg/ml of a control rHA from A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) had a haemagglutination titer of 2048, equivalent to 20,480 units/mg HA protein. The Ser 200 rHAsimilarly had no agglutination activity for guinea pig RBC. Trypsinisation of the Ser 200 rHA had no effect on the lack of agglutination activity.

The predicted binding energy of the Ser 200 HA variant for both the human and avian sialic acid receptors was lower than the binding energy of Pro 200 HA(Table 1), which could help explain the lack of RBC agglutination activity of the Ser 200 rHA variant. The model further showed the Pro 200 !Ser 200 HA mutation altered the binding mode of the HA head to the sialic acid receptors.
