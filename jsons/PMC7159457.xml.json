(subfamily Cyrtandroideae; Burtt and Wiehler, 1995; species and voucher information has been archived at the Botanical Society of America website at http://ajbsupp.botany.org/) because previous studies have supported the monophyly of the Gesnerioideae (Smith and Carroll, 1997; Smith and Atkinson, 1998). The ingroup comprised 57 species representing all five tribes of the Gesnerioideae, including 16 genera of tribe Gloxinieae, 12 genera of tribe Episcieae, 3 genera of tribe Beslerieae, the 1 genus of tribe Napeantheae, and 2 genera of tribe Gesnerieae (http://ajbsupp.botany.org/). Some greenhouse plants included in this study died before being vouchered (marked \u201cnot vouchered\u201d in the table at http://ajbsupp.botany.org/), but their identity was verified by L. E. Skog. Some of these unvouchered taxa are Gesneria L. and Rhytidophyllum Mart. specimens obtained from the Montreal Botanical Garden, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Whether they have been vouchered there is unknown. The sample labeled Rhytidophyllum vernicosum Urb. & Ekman may not be that species but a closely related undescribed species. Until additional samples of this collection can be obtained, its exact disposition cannot be verified. Regardless, in the molecular trees, the phylogenetic position of the sample identified as R. vernicosum is where either R. vernicosum or the undescribed species of Rhytidophyllum would be expected to occur.",

The MP analysis of cpDNA spacers was limited to 200 trees of equal length for each of the 100 replicates due to the large number of equal\u2010length trees. Clade robustness was estimated using the parsimony jackknife (jk) analysis (10 000 \u201cfast addition\u201d heuristic replicates, \u201cjac\u201d emulated, 33% deletion; Farris et al., 1996; Mort et al., 2000). The fast addition heuristic search is a method in which each replicate is performed using one random\u2010sequence\u2010addition replicate and no branch swapping. Very similar values were found using 10 000 fast addition bootstrap replicates (data not shown). Three ingroup data sets were analyzed and compared: ITS, trnL\u2010F + trnE\u2010T, and a combination of these. Some gaps (indels) in the data matrices were mapped onto the combined analysis strict consensus tree (Fig. 3). Autapomorphic gaps and complex gaps (such as those associated with single\u2010base repeat regions) were not included as mapped characters.",

The cpDNA spacers were automatically combined, as they are both part of the nonrecombining chloroplast and any differences between them are likely due to homoplasy rather than separate histories. With the partition homogeneity test, 10 000 replicate data partitions were run (heuristic search; simple addition; no branch swapping), excluding constant characters. This test measures character congruence by comparing tree\u2010length differences among trees derived from resampled data partitions of the combined data sets and trees derived from the defined data partition (i.e., nrDNA vs. cpDNA). Differences in branch support between the different data sets were assessed by comparing jackknife support values for branches in conflict. Conflicting branch structure that was well supported (jk > 67%) as being different between the ITS and cpDNA data sets was considered to be in conflict, while branch structure that was different, but not well supported by one or both data sets, was not considered to represent conflict. The ITS and cpDNA data sets were analyzed in separate maximum likelihood (ML) analyses based on the likelihood ratio test as implemented by Modeltest 2.1 (Posada and Crandall, 1998).",

Heuristic searches were employed (ACCTRAN; starting tree based on neighbor\u2010joining reconstruction; TBR branch swapping; STEEPEST DESCENT). The general time reversable (GTR) model of evolution (Yang, 1994a) with an estimated gamma shape parameter (gamma) and estimated proportion of invariant sites (p\u2010inv) was used in the ML analysis of ITS (Gu, Fu, and Li, 1995). Gamma and p\u2010inv were used to measure among\u2010site rate variation. The Kimura three parameter with unequal base frequencies (K3Puf) model of evolution (Kimura, 1981) with an estimated gamma shape parameter (Yang, 1994b) was used on the ML analysis of cpDNA spacer data. The choice of these models for the separate data sets was based on the results of analyses using Modeltest 2.1 (Posada and Crandall, 1998). The Modeltest 2.1 analysis tests the fit of various ML models to the data set and estimates base change frequencies, proportion of variable characters, and shape of the gamma distribution, and chooses the model that best fits the data using the hierarchical likelihood ratio test (Posada and Crandall, 1998).",

In the case of species included in the analyses that have not been previously counted, they were assumed to have the chromosome number of other members of the genus. While this assumption could have misled inferences of chromosome evolution, we did not expect it to impact this study to any large degree due to the relative rarity of changes in chromosome number across the Gesnerioideae (Skog, 1984).",

The aligned ITS data matrix was 731 base pairs (bp) long with 424 variable sites, of which 322 were parsimony informative. The length of the unaligned sequences varied from 608 to 645 bp. Three sequences are missing a portion (52\u201381 aligned bp) of the 5\u2032 end of the ITS1 spacer due to poor sequencing of that region (Paliavana prasina (Ker Gawl.) Fritsch, Pearcea abunda (wiehler) L.P. Kvist & L.E. Skog, and Vanhouttea lanata Fritsch). The alignment of the ITS region was somewhat difficult, particularly between the outgroups, members of the Beslerieae and Napeantheae, and the rest of the subfamily. Multiple alignments were explored (data not shown) without major changes to tree topology. Two regions of the nrDNA spacers (a 53\u2010bp region of ITS1, exclusion set 1, and a 66\u2010bp region of ITS2, exclusion set 2) were particularly difficult to align with confidence. These regions were excluded separately and collectively in additional analyses (data not shown). These alternative analyses resulted in no major topological rearrangements to well\u2010supported branches (branches with >67% jk), but did lower support for some clades. Exclusion set 1 resulted in a nearly identical support tree. Exclusion set 2 and the combined exclusion of sets 1 and 2 resulted in the drop of statistical support of the association of Napeanthus with the Beslerieae clade to below 50% and reduced the statistical support for the pairing of the Gesnerieae clade and the Gloxinieae clade to <50%. The most inclusive alignment resulted in 42 gaps ranging from 1 to 22 bp in length. Eleven of these gaps were single\u2010base indels.

While the partition homogeneity test provides a test of congruence among data sets, it is not clear how the test is affected by differences in gene history vs. homoplasy (Miller, Rausher, and Manos, 1999). The likelihood ratio test explores differences in the model of nucleotide change, not necessarily topological differences supported by the data sets. Additionally, many authors consider simultaneous analysis of all data to be the most effective way to study evolutionary descent (Thornton and DeSalle [2000] and references therein). In this study, the incongruences between the data sets do not generally involve well\u2010supported branches. In fact, the relationships that this study is most interested in addressing (tribal relationships) have the same topology in the separate analyses. Therefore, the data sets were combined to optimize the resolving power of all of the data in a single analysis.",

Group 3 is more problematic from a morphological point of view, as it includes G. citrina, a species that had always been included among typical species of Gesneria. This species is a pendent plant in the wild, with small plane leaves and bright yellow tubular flowers, very different from the typical shrubby species of Rhytidophyllum with large bullate or areolate leaves and red, green, or rarely yellow campanulate corollas (Skog, 1976).",

One cross has been successful between Gloxinia perennis and Koellikeria erinoides (Roberts, 1985), but no indication of pollen viability was offered.

Interestingly, G. sarmentiana is somewhat separated geographically from most of the rest of Gloxinia (in southern Brazil vs. the Andes mountains for most of Gloxinia), and has a different storage organ type than typical Gloxinia species (it has a \u201clumpy rhizome\u201d that is similar to tubers on a rhizome vs. a scaly rhizome for the rest of Gloxinia; Fritsch, 1900; J.

As a means of more directly investigating these questions, comparisons were made between sequences of two species (Gesneria christii and Niphaea oblonga Lindl.) where the identical collection was sequenced for ITS in Smith (2000b) and this study (USBRG 94\u2010507 and USBRG 78\u2010354, respectively).

            "text": "Sequencing methodologies could possibly provide an explanation for some of the differences seen in the sequences. Our sequences were obtained using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit run on an Applied Biosystems Model 377 Automated sequencer with full overlap along both strands (PE Biosystems). This method of sequencing produces clean sequencing chromatograms, which, when both strands are sequenced, provide for confident base calling. The Smith (2000b) paper cites Smith et al. (1997b) for ITS sequencing methodologies, which were apparently the same as for the previous ndhF studies and utilized the Silver Sequence method (Promega). While this is an accepted method of sequencing, it does not provide for computer construction of consensus sequences from multiple strands (such as the Sequencher software package), which minimizes error in sequence reading and archiving. The explanation for the high frequency of missing data (Ns) is unclear. Smith (2000b) indicated that insertion/deletion (indel) events were coded as missing data, which could explain the Ns. However, GenBank notes that the sequences were not submitted as an aligned dataset, so there is no reason for indel events to be marked in the sequences. Additionally, the presence of the Ns aligned with our gaps do not explain the divergence between Smith's (2000b) and our sequences. Gaps do not contribute to uncorrected pairwise divergence estimates, so it is only sites where bases are called in both sequences that contribute to this measure.",

Previous studies have suggested these clades were monophyletic but poorly supported, paraphyletic, or even polyphyletic (Smith, 1996, 2000a, b; Smith and Carroll, 1997; Smith et al., 1997a, b; Smith and Atkinson, 1998). With the exception of the distribution of the n = 11 taxa, the phylogenetic hypotheses presented here are also congruent with a minimal number of chromosomal changes in the subfamily. There are still problems with generic circumscription in some lineages (e.g., Gloxinia). While the Gesnerioideae tribal circumscriptions of Burtt and Wiehler (1995) largely agree with the phylogenies presented here, this study provides evidence that Sinningia, Paliavana, and Vanhouttea might be best dealt with as a tribe separate from the Gloxinieae. Additionally, Gloxinia sarmentiana may represent an additional major lineage of the Gesnerioideae. The molecular phylogenetic hypotheses do not completely agree with the traditional explanation for the evolution of some morphological characters (e.g., ovary position). The nodes placing the Sinningia clade and Gloxinia sarmentiana sister to the Episcieae rather than sister to the Gloxinieae and Gesnerieae needs to be explored to resolve this issue.",
