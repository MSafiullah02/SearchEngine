            "text": "Some viruses infect hosts over a range of temperatures depending on the host species. Most notable are the arboviruses which may infect the arthropod vector over a range of ambient temperatures from ~15 \u00b0C to >30 \u00b0C (Mullens et al., 2004), and then infect a vertebrate host at temperatures from 37 \u00b0C up to 44 \u00b0C in the case of West Nile virus (WNV) in infected American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) (Kinney et al., 2006). Birds generally have higher body temperatures than mammals (Brault 2009) and the avian influenza virus (AIV) when jumping from birds to humans has to adapt to a temperature drop of 8 \u00b0C since the temperature in the human upper respiratory tract is ~33 \u00b0C compared to ~41 \u00b0C in the avian intestinal tract which is the site of replication of avian viruses (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014). Bats have higher core body temperatures than primates (up to 42.1 \u00b0C for Phyllostomus hastatus which is an omnivorous bat from South America) when flying (O'Shea et al., 2014). The core body temperature during flight of the insectivorous free-tailed bat (Mops condylurus) which may have been the origin of the 2013/15 severe Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa (Saez et al., 2015) is 40.5 \u00b0C \u00b1 1 \u00b0C (O'Shea et al., 2014). Thus EBOV which infects a range of vertebrate species from bats to primates and deer may have to infect mammalian hosts over a range of temperatures. Similarly Nipah virus on jumping from fruit bats to pigs and humans (Daszak et al., 2013) may experience a small fall in temperature. Furthermore, cross-species transmission of viruses to bats (and other mammals) from invertebrates may occur with more regularity than has been appreciated (Bennett et al., 2018; Leendertz 2016), and Bennett et al. (2018) have suggested that arthropods may host many \u201cbat-associated\u201d viruses that have defied detection in bats themselves (e.g. EBOV). Depending on the ambient temperature, viruses in arthropods would experience a 9 \u00b0C to 15 \u00b0C temperature increase on being ingested by a bat at 41 \u00b0C (Gale 2017) and this could affect the binding affinity of the virus to its host cell depending on the thermodynamics of virus binding as is discussed here. In contrast other viruses only infect related host species, and in effect are maintained at similar temperatures. For example, simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) infect 36 different nonhuman primate species in sub-Saharan Africa and SIVs from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have crossed species barriers on multiple occasions generating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 (Sharp et al., 2005). Thus the main source of temperature variation experienced by SIV and HIV would be the effect of the circadian rhythm and the slight rise in temperature due to infection of the host which gives a range of 36 \u00b0C to 38 \u00b0C in the case of Rhesus monkeys (Huitron-Resendiz et al., 2007).",

The Cr molecule on the cell surface may be a protein as in the case of HIV (Myszka et al., 2000), EBOV (Yuan et al., 2015), Hendra virus (Xu et al., 2012) and MERS-CoV (Lu et al., 2013) or alternatively is a sialic acid (SA) on a glycan as in the case of AIV (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014; Fei et al., 2015) and arboviruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV) (Zhang et al., 2010). The thermodynamics of virus binding in terms of the changes in enthalpy (\u0394Ha_receptor_T) and entropy (\u0394Sa_receptor_T) on the specific interaction of the GP with the Cr receptor at temperature T during binding of virus to the host cell surface has been set out previously (Gale 2018, 2019). The interactions between the HIV GP and its CD4 cellular receptor (Myszka et al., 2000; Dey et al., 2007) and between the AIV haemagglutinin (HA) and its \u03b12,3-SA or \u03b12,6-SA receptors (Fei et al., 2015) are enthalpy driven, i.e. large negative values of \u0394Ha_receptor_T overcome unfavourable values of \u0394Sa_receptor_T. Also the binding of vesicular stomatitis virus to phospholipid bilayers is enthalpy driven (Carneio et al. 2002) with very large negative values of \u0394Ha_receptor_T.",

There may also be constraints on the activities of viral replication proteins such as the AIV polymerase which showed a significantly higher activity at 33 \u00b0C than 37 \u00b0C (Ngai et al., 2013). Only virus binding is considered here. Thus according to the Van't Hoff Isochore, the binding affinity for a virus to its host cell at temperature T as represented by the association constant Ka_virus_T would be greatly diminished for enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures compared to lower temperatures depending on the magnitude of \u0394Ha_receptor_T (Gale 2019). Indeed, assuming \u0394Ha_receptor_T is constant over the temperature range, the more negative \u0394Ha_receptor_T is in magnitude, the weaker the binding at higher temperatures. This presents a paradox if the Ka_virus_T falls to less than ~1014 M\u2212\n1 in that higher temperatures would greatly diminish infectivity (Gale 2019).",

A recent analysis has shown that virion volume (and genome length) for dsDNA viruses decreases by about 55-fold as the temperature of occurrence (i.e. host) increases from 0 to 40 \u00b0C (Nifong and Gillooly 2016). The temperature of occurrence in these dsDNA viruses ranges from near zero for those inhabiting polar environments to over 40 \u00b0C for those inhabiting endothermic vertebrates. Nifong and Gillooly (2016) suggest that this could reflect smaller viruses being able to replicate more quickly (due to more compact genomes) perhaps together with energetic constraints imposed by their hosts. However from the thermodynamic perspective, the decrease in volume and hence mass and radius of the virus will make \u0394Sa_immob less negative for a smaller virus than for a larger virus. It is shown here how a less negative \u0394Sa_immob increases binding of the virus at the relatively high mammalian body temperatures and it is proposed that thermodynamic binding constraints may give smaller viruses a selective advantage for infecting hosts at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. In this respect, the large size of the HIV virion may present a constraint to binding at human body temperatures compared to the much smaller arboviruses for example.",

            "text": "In the case of HIV, the GP component of the GP/Cr interaction is the envelope protein (Env) which is a trimer of gp120 monomers. Each HIV Env trimer interacts with one CD4 molecule (Chuang et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017a). This is different from the AIV HA trimer in which each monomer in the trimer interacts with one glycan Cr (De Graaf and Fouchier, 2014; Fei et al., 2015). Initial attachment of the HIV virion to the host CD4+\nT cell surface is relatively nonspecific (Wilen et al., 2012) with HIV Env interacting with negatively charged host cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycans, or with pattern recognition receptors. According to Wilen et al. (2012), non-specific HIV attachment to the host cell via any of these factors likely brings HIV Env into close proximity with the viral receptor CD4 and the CRR5 coreceptor, so increasing the efficiency of infection, although the physiologic role of non-specific attachment in vivo remains unclear. Here it is suggested that non-specific binding helps to overcome the thermodynamic entropy constraint of immobilisation of a large virus on binding at human body temperature by taking some of the entropy loss in \u0394Sa_immob prior to specific HIV Env:CD4 binding. This would be consistent with the fact that non-specific attachment factors differ from receptors in that they are not essential, although they augment infection in vitro (Wilen et al., 2012).",

It is known that increasing host membrane fluidity at higher temperature allows effective recruitment of more Cr molecules to bind the HIV virion (Harada et al., 2004) such that the number, n, of GP/Cr contacts increases with temperature (Frey et al., 1995), and that increasing n can overcome both the effect of temperature on decreasing the GP/Cr binding affinity and the effect of a large negative \u0394Sa_immob (Gale 2019). The thermodynamic HIV binding model here is therefore modified to accommodate increasing n with temperature and so attempt to reproduce the results of Frey et al. (1995). The success of the model here is in predicting the subsequent decrease in binding reported by Frey et al. (1995) at higher temperatures due to \u0394Sa_immob.",

In effect therefore the heat capacity of the \u201cbulk\u201d (i.e. non-GP/Cr) of the bound virus/host cell is the same as the sum of the heat capacities for the free virus and free host cell. This is acceptable because a change in heat capacity is related to a change in conformation of the molecular components (Myszka et al., 2000) and the conformation of the bulk of the host cell and the virus would be unaffected by attachment. Indeed, \u0394Sa_immob is mainly related to changes in rotational and translational mobility of the virus particle as a whole (see below) and does not involve the conformational changes in GP and Cr which are accommodated in the \u0394Sa_receptor_T term (Gale 2019). Since the heat capacity of the \u201cbulk\u201d of the bound virus/host cell is the same as the sum of the heat capacities for the free virus and free host cell, \u0394Cp for the bulk equals zero, and according to Eq.

Values of Ka_virus_T intercept at T = T0 because the n.\u0394Cp (T \u2013 T0 + T.ln(T/T0)) term in Eq. (11) equals zero. Therefore for the purpose of demonstrating the effect of \u0394Cp on the temperature sensitivity of Ka_virus_T, T0 needs to be chosen to be well above or below the temperature range of interest. It should be noted that the choice of reference temperature is artificial and is only used here out of necessity to demonstrate the effect of different \u0394Cp values while fixing the Ka_virus_T intercept temperature. Indeed a given GP/Cr system has its own natural \u0394Cp value which cannot be altered and is measured experimentally (Myszka et al., 2000; Fei et al., 2015). The T0 temperature of 37 \u00b0C is appropriate to study arthropod vector competence for arbovirus transmission over the 10 to 35 \u00b0C temperature range in Case studies 1 and 2 as used previously for the arthropod vector competence model (Gale 2019). However, since 37 \u00b0C is the human body temperature at which HIV binds to host cells, 37 \u00b0C is not a good choice for T0 in case study 3 for which T0 is therefore set to 4 \u00b0C. The reference temperature is 37 \u00b0C in Case studies 4, 5 and 6 because the experimentally measured value of \u0394Cp for HIV gp120:CD4 binding (Fig. 1) is used together with \u0394Ha_receptor_T0 and \u0394Sa_receptor_T0 values measured experimentally at a temperature T0 of 37 \u00b0C (Myszka et al., 2000), i.e. real data are used.",

(2005) using defective HIV gp120 monomers concluded that a single Env trimer is sufficient to mediate the entry of one virion, but that all three gp120 monomers in that trimer must be active. Klasse (2012) has proposed that a realistic model allows both a minimum requirement of two gp120 monomers with an increment in function by the third. This is consistent with the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of the Env glycoprotein trimer (Liu et al., 2017a) showing that in each trimer, one gp120 monomer makes a primary contact with the bound CD4 Cr molecule while a second makes a partial contact (called the quaternary contact reflecting protein structure nomenclature) and the third gp120 monomer makes no direct contact with the CD4 at all. For the purpose of the model here, n represents the number of Env trimers on each HIV virion that interact with a CD4 Cr during binding. Brandenberg et al. (2015) demonstrate that divergent HIV strains differ in their stoichiometry of entry and require between 1 and 7 Env trimers, with most strains depending on 2 to 3 Env trimers to complete infection. Here it is assumed that n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions for HIV binding although the results of Brandenberg et al. (2015) do not separate cell surface binding itself from the subsequent HIV/cell fusion in the entry process. If it is later found that cell surface binding only requires one Env:CD4 interaction for example, while more are required for the membrane fusion, then the model here for C.VT should be re-parameterised with n = 1 although the number of Env:CCR5 and non-specific Env interactions with attachment factors (see below) should also be built into the model. It should be noted that as for the arbovirus model, it is assumed that the n = 3 Env:CD4 interactions act independently and not co-operatively in binding. This is reflected in Eqs. (7) and (8) where \u0394Ha_receptor_T and \u0394Sa_receptor_T act additively.",

(2000) in Table 4\n. To the author's knowledge there are no data for \u0394Ha_receptor_T and \u0394Sa_receptor_T for Env trimer binding to CD4. Therefore the values for \u0394Ha_receptor_T0 and \u0394Sa_receptor_T0 for HIV gp120 monomer:CD4 binding at 37 \u00b0C from Myszka et al. (2000) are used for Env trimer binding to a single CD4 in the HIV model in Fig. 4\na and b as set out in Table 4. Dey et al. (2007) reported values at 37 \u00b0C of \u2212287.9 kJ/mol and \u2013786.9 J/mol/K for \u0394Ha_receptor_T and \u0394Sa_receptor_T respectively for the wildtype HIV-1 YU2 gp120 monomer binding to soluble CD4. The more negative \u0394Sa_receptor_T value for gp120 monomer:CD4 binding from Dey et al. (2007) reduces the binding affinity for gp120:CD4 by nine-fold (Kd_receptor_\nT = 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M) at 37 \u00b0C compared to that of 4.75 \u00d7 10\u22129 M from Myszka et al. (2000) (Table 4). This difference may simply reflect the different strains of HIV-1 used, namely YU2 by Dey et al. (2007) and WD61 by Myszka et al. (2000). The HIV gp120 monomer:CD4 binding data of Myszka et al. (2000) are chosen here over those of Dey et al. (2007) because Myszka et al. (2000) present the variation in \u0394Ha_receptor_T with temperature as shown in Fig. 1 together with information on \u0394Cp which Dey et al. (2007) do not consider. It is therefore assumed here that \u0394Cp = \u22125.02 kJ/mol/K for the Env trimer:CD4 interaction as reported by Myszka et al. (2000) for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction (Table 3).",

The model here takes 1 mm3 of blood with Ctotal = 103 CD4+\nT cells and introduces Vtotal = 105 HIV virions. Dividing 105 HIV virions in 10\u22126 dm3 by the Avogadro number gives [Vtotal] = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221213 M. The advantage of using a high Vtotal that greatly exceeds Ctotal is that as previously demonstrated by Gale (2018) not only may the fraction, FcT, of CD4+\nT cells with bound HIV be calculated from Eq. (13) with [Vfree] ~ [Vtotal] but also any complications of handling stochastic effects at low virus doses are avoided. It is recognised that the HIV concentration at 105 HIV virions per mm3 used in this model is 10-fold to 100-fold higher than that expected in a recipient person's blood present in the capillaries lining the skin at the wound site where semen or blood from an infected source were introduced since maximum human plasma and human semen HIV loadings are in the region of 13,000 copies per mm3 and 1800 copies per mm3 respectively (Gupta et al., 1997). This is not important, however, because the purpose of the models here in Figs. 4\n\u20136 is not to produce a realistic dose-response but to explore the effect of changing \u0394Cp, \u0394Sa_immob, n and temperature on the trend in the predicted number, C.VT, of host CD4+\nT cells with bound virus. Indeed, the overall conclusions of the model in terms of the effect of temperature on the number of CD4+\nT cells with bound virus will still be representative and the interpretation applicable to all doses of viruses as there is no cooperation between viruses in this model (Gale 2018). Furthermore, the levels of SIV in Rhesus monkey blood plasma were in the region of 2.1 \u00d7 108 virions per ml (Huitron-Resendiz et al., 2007) which is 2.1 \u00d7 105 virions per mm3 and representative of the 105 used for [Vtotal] in the model here. C.VT is calculated by multiplying FcT by Ctotal (Eq. (14)).",

(2013) reported a Kd_virus of 10\u221215 M for AIV where Kd_virus is the dissociation constant for virus from the host cell and is the inverse of Ka_virus_T. According to Yang et al. (2005) HIV virions bearing influenza A virus HA required 8 or 9 HA trimers for virus entry. This is equivalent to n = 24 to 27 HA monomers each of Kd_receptor = 10\u22123 M (Xiong et al., 2013). It is not clear whether the 8 or 9 AIV HA trimers are required for cell binding or membrane fusion in Yang et al. (2005). However, if n = 24 HA monomers are required for AIV binding to the host cell to give a Ka_virus_T of 1015 M\u2212\n1 then \u0394Sa_immob equals \u22121091 J/mol/K from Eq. (17) (derived in Gale 2019). This is in the same order of magnitude as assumed for \u0394Sa_immob on the basis of virus molecular weight (Gale 2019). It must be emphasized that the estimate of 8 or 9 HA trimers in Yang et al. (2005) is based on a number of assumptions that may not hold, for example whereas each infection of a cell is a quantal, all-or-nothing event, the infectivity of a virion could span a wide spectrum of propensities and each mathematical model could have different virological interpretations (see Klasse 2012). However, in the absence of any data for \u0394Sa_immob the value of n from Yang et al. (2005) at least provides a theoretical approach to estimate it from Eq. (17) for this \u201cproof of concept\u201d model.",

In contrast, HIV is much larger with a mean diameter of 134 nm in the case of mature HIV virions containing a single core (Briggs et al., 2003). The problem with Eq. (18) is that proportionality constants in units of J/mol/K are needed probably based on R as in the Sackur-Tetrode equation and the natural logarithm terms should be dimensionless such that the units of radius cancel out. However for the purpose of representing the effect of increasing the radius of the virus on \u0394Sa_immob\nEq. (18) is used with the virus radius in units of nm. Thus from Eq. (18), the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob for a virus of diameter 134 nm is 18.6% more negative than that for a virus of diameter 66 nm. To illustrate the effect of increasing virus size on the number of CD4+\nT cells in 1 mm3 of blood with bound virus, C.VT is calculated for the HIV model using values of \u0394Sa_immob which decrease in steps of 18.6% from \u2212240 J/mol/K (i.e. to \u2212285 J/mol/K, \u2212337 J/Mol/K and \u2212400 J/mol/K).",

(17) such that Ka_virus_T falls below 1014 M\u2212 1 at progressively lower temperatures. Values of C.VT with \u0394Sa_immob decreasing from \u2212240 J/mol/K to \u2212400 J/mol/K in steps of 18.6% are plotted in Fig. 5b and show that the number of cells with bound virus falls to <1 at progressively lower temperature as \u0394Sa_immob becomes more negative through increasing the virus diameter. The temperature at which C.VT falls to <1 is predicted to increase from 22 \u00b0C to 43 \u00b0C as \u0394Sa_immob increases in magnitude from \u2212400 J/mol/K to \u2212240 J/mol/K.

(19) thus increasing \u0394Sa_specific for specific Env:CD4 binding (as \u0394Sa_immob in Eq. (11)) from \u2212400 J/mol/K to \u2212240 J/mol/K. Fig. 5b shows that the number of CD4+\nT cells in a 1 mm3 vol of blood with bound HIV falls from 1000 to <1 over a temperature range of ~10 \u00b0C. The temperature at which fewer than half the T cells in the 1 mm3 vol of blood have bound HIV virus increases with increasing \u0394Sa_specific from 12.5 \u00b0C for \u0394Sa_specific = \u2212400 J/mol/K to 36.5 \u00b0C for \u0394Sa_specific = \u2212240 J/mol/K (Fig. 5b). Indeed once the \u0394Sa_specific is >\u2212200 J/mol/K, 98% of the 1000 T cells have bound HIV at 37 \u00b0C (not shown). With \u0394Sa_specific <\u2212285 J/mol/K virus is not specifically bound to any of the 1000 T cells at temperatures above 37 \u00b0C. It is concluded that the effect of making \u0394Sa_immob less unfavourable through prior non-specific binding taking some of the entropy loss enhances subsequent specific binding of HIV through Env:CD4 interactions at higher temperatures. Fig. 5c shows that at 37 \u00b0C increasing \u0394Sa_specific from \u2212400 to \u2212240 J/mol/K increases the number of CD4+\nT cells with HIV bound through specific Env/CD4 interactions in a 1 mm3 vol of blood from 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 307.

            "text": "Cells expressing HIV Env on their surface can bind and fuse with cells expressing CD4 Cr (Frey et al., 1995). Frey et al. (1995) reported a three to four fold increase in cell binding at temperatures above 25 \u00b0C with a substantial decrease in binding at temperatures above 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 6\n), the latter being predicted by the thermodynamic model in Fig. 5b. Frey et al. (1995) attribute the increase at 25 \u00b0C to the additional adhesion molecules which are brought into contact to increase the avidity of binding at higher temperatures. The thermodynamic model for HIV binding with \u0394Sa_immob of \u2212206 J/mol/K reproduces the increase in predicted C.VT in Fig. 6a by increasing n from 1 to 3 over the temperature range 25 \u00b0C and 27 \u00b0C to reflect the effect of temperature facilitating multiple HIV adhesion/binding sites due to increased membrane fluidity (Frey et al., 1995; Harada et al., 2004). Increasing n from 1 to 9 over the temperature range 19 \u00b0C and 27 \u00b0C gives a sharp increase in C.VT at 26 \u00b0C (Fig. 6b) with \u0394Sa_immob of \u22121110 J/mol/K. The subsequent sharp fall in C.VT at temperatures above 37 \u00b0C is due to the large negative magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob (\u2212206 J/mol/K in Fig. 6a and -1110 J/mol/K in Fig. 6b) relative to n such that the diminished GP/Cr affinity at higher temperatures is not sufficient to maintain binding even with n = 9 GP/Cr interactions in Fig. 6b. The decrease in GP/Cr binding affinity with temperature for HIV Env:CD4 is apparent from the Ka_virus_T values in Fig. 5a and the increase in the values of Kd_receptor_T for the temperatures 4 \u00b0C, 25 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C in Table 4.",

It is possible that statistical thermodynamics approaches analogous to the Sackur-Tetrode equation for the entropy of a gas may be developed to estimate \u0394Sa_immob theoretically. The large size of the HIV virion (134 nm mean diameter) compared to a typical arbovirus (50 to 70 nm diameter) is consistent with a more negative value of \u0394Sa_immob providing justification for the more negative \u0394Sa_immob values used here for the HIV models in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 compared to that used for the arbovirus models in Figs. 2 and 3.",

The results with varying \u0394Cp in Fig. 4 are therefore hypothetical but illustrate how the large negative \u0394Cp for the HIV Env:CD4 interaction diminishes binding at the higher temperatures of mammals and birds compared to a system such as HA/SA for which \u0394Cp = 0 kJ/mol/K. Thus, a less negative \u0394Cp increases the number of cells with bound virus at higher temperatures, albeit more markedly for the reference temperature T0 = 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 4d) than for T0 = 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 4b). In the absence of data for \u0394Cp for HIV Env:CD4 binding, the value for the gp120 monomer:CD4 interaction is used for the HIV models in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6. Evidence for a large negative \u0394Cp for HIV Env:CD4 binding is that cryo-EM demonstrates considerable conformational shifts (Liu et al., 2017a).",

This is due to the reduced affinity of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures. Making \u0394Sa_immob more negative shifts the Ka_virus_T curve to lower values (Fig. 5a) thus exacerbating the effect of higher temperature on reducing binding. As Ka_virus_T falls below 1014 M \u2212 1 at higher temperatures, so C.VT falls (Fig. 5b). The magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob merely positions the C.VT curve relative to the temperature scale with less negative values of \u0394Sa_immob shifting the curve to higher temperatures (Fig. 5b) such that high C.VT values are maintained at progressively higher temperatures as \u0394Sa_immob becomes less negative (Fig. 5c).",

Furthermore, a large negative \u0394Sa_immob imposes additional constraints on virus binding at higher temperatures exacerbating the reduced strength of the enthalpy-driven GP/Cr interactions at higher temperatures. Therefore other mechanisms may be needed by the virus to achieve binding at 37 \u00b0C. These could include more GP/Cr contacts at higher temperature (Frey et al., 1995; Harada et al., 2004). An alternative strategy evolved by viruses could be to make \u0394Sa_immob itself less negative such that virus binding is maintained at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. Two possible evolutionary strategies are suggested here which could make \u0394Sa_immob less negative. The first is decreasing the size of the virus and the second is the use of non-specific attachment factors to randomly trap the virus on the cell surface prior to specific GP/Cr binding.",

This could explain the decrease in volume of viruses with increasing host/environment temperature as reported by Nifong and Gillooly (2016) for dsDNA viruses. Thus the average diameters of dsDNA viruses decreased from 182 nm at a host/environment temperature of 10 \u00b0C down to 74 nm at 37 \u00b0C according to the best fit line of Nifong and Gillooly (2016) suggesting the HIV virion at 134 nm mean diameter is almost double the size for a virus infecting at avian/mammalian host temperature. It is interesting to note that thermophilic bacteria adapted to high temperature may be subject to selection favouring smaller cell size. This may aid attachment to biofilms which provide some protection against temperature stress.",

Thus the shift in the Ka_virus_T curve to higher values with a less negative \u0394Sa_immob in Fig. 5a is consistent with HIV attachment factors augmenting infection (Wilen et al., 2012). Indeed with n = 3 Env:CD4 contacts, significant binding of HIV to host cells is only achieved at 37 \u00b0C if \u0394Sa_immob is increased to > \u2212280 J/mol/K (Fig. 5c). \u0394Sa_immob is estimated here to be \u22121091 J/mol/K for HIV. Thus the prior non-specific binding of HIV would need to realise a \u0394Sa_non_specific of \u2212810 J/mol/K for subsequent effective Env:CD4 binding at human body temperature according to the model such that \u0394Sa_non_specific in Eq. (19) takes ~75% of the entropy loss in \u0394Sa_immob. Wilen et al. (2012) also report that HIV attachment factors are not essential. Again this is consistent with the model here when it is noted that the C.VT value of <1 CD4+\nT cell with bound virus in Fig. 5b is not a threshold and merely represents 1 mm3 of blood. Thus with \u0394Sa_immob = \u2212348 J/mol/K, C.VT = 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 5c). This represents one CD4+\nT cell with bound HIV in 1000 \u00d7 1 mm3 vol of blood, i.e. in 1 cm3 of blood. Decreasing \u0394Sa_immob further to \u2212405 J/mol/K gives C.VT = 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 at 37 \u00b0C representing one CD4+\nT cell with bound HIV in 1 litre of blood.",

Figure 9 of Antoine et al. (2012) shows a herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) bound to a tetrahedral nanoparticle of zinc oxide (ZnO) called a zinc oxide tetrapod (ZnOT). The mechanism behind the ability of ZnOTs to prevent, neutralize or reduce HSV-2 infection relies on their ability to bind the HSV-2 virions (Antoine et al., 2012). The ZnOT being some 40 \u00b5m in size is much larger than the attached virion which could still attach to a host cell surface in terms of spatial considerations. However, the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob for an HSV-2 virion bound to a ZnOT nanoparticle would be very large and negative, indeed much more negative than for \u0394Sa_immob for a free HSV-2 virion. Thus according to Fig. 5c, binding of HSV-2/ZnOT to host cells would be greatly diminished particularly at the human body temperature due to the very large negative \u0394Sa_immob. Although \u0394Sa_immob changes logarithmically (i.e. slowly) with virus size according to Eq. (18), the number, C.VT, of cells with bound virus is very sensitive to changes in \u0394Sa_immob at 37 \u00b0C (Fig. 5c). It is proposed that antiviral research should take into account and even focus on making the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob more negative in addition to looking at conventional approaches to block the GP/Cr interaction. The advantage of focusing on \u0394Sa_immob is that only one ZnOT nanoparticle has to bind to a virus to markedly affect \u0394Sa_immob, while a large proportion of the GP molecules on the virus have to be bound with inhibitors, including neutralising antibodies, to block virus binding (Klasse 2012) and hence eliminate \u0394Ha_receptor_T0 in Eq. (11). The temperature dependence of virus diffusion in mucus (Erickson et al., 2015) could also be considered not only in mechanistic dose-response models for viral infection at mucosal epithelial membranes in the intestine (Gale 2018) but also in terms of therapeutics when combined with the thermodynamic approach developed here. Normal, acidic cervicovaginal mucus greatly hinders the movement of virions of HSV and HIV, whereas mucus that is neutralized by semen provides a much less effective barrier against the same virions (Erickson et al., 2015). Thus binding of the HSV or HIV virion to a ZnOT particle may not only decrease its diffusion coefficient in mucus but also make the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob more negative hence reducing the binding affinity of those virions which do make it through the mucus to the epithelial cell surface at human body temperature.",

This is unexpected on the basis of the \u0394Ha_receptor_T values reported by Myszka et al. (2000) for gp120:CD4 which become less negative with decreasing temperature (Fig. 1). However, according to Eq. (6) the predicted \u0394Sa_receptor_T term becomes more favourable (less negative) with decreasing temperature and it is therefore the entropy term that facilitates the tighter binding of gp120 to CD4 at lower temperatures. Unfortunately Myszka et al. (2000) only give the full range of values for \u0394Ha_receptor_T (Fig. 1) with no data for \u0394Sa_receptor_T over the range of temperature. However, Myszka et al. (2000) do give some graphical data from which \u0394Sa_receptor_T at 25 \u00b0C can be estimated and it is reassuring this \u0394Sa_receptor_T is much less negative at \u2212473 J/mol/K than that of \u2212691 J/mol/K measured at 37 \u00b0C and furthermore is actually less negative than the value of \u2212492.8 J/mol/K predicted for 25 \u00b0C by Eq. (6) (Table 4) and used in the model in Fig. 5. This is strong experimental evidence that warming to 37 \u00b0C and above does indeed give a significant reduction in the binding affinity of Env to CD4 as borne out by the 52-fold increase in the Kd_receptor_T value for gp120:CD4 on warming from 25 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C as calculated from the actual data of Myszka et al. (2000) (Table 4). Furthermore it suggests that the actual increase in Ka_virus_T on cooling from 37 \u00b0C down to 25 \u00b0C may be greater than that predicted by the model in Fig. 5a. The decrease in binding affinity with increasing temperature for HIV Env:CD4 is also supported by experimental data of Moore and Klasse (1992) which showed that soluble CD4 dissociated from HIV virions at temperatures above 35 \u00b0C. Similarly Doranz et al. (1999) demonstrated that gp120 bound to CD4+\nT cells began to dissociate at temperatures above 45 \u00b0C. The data of Frey et al. (1995) in Fig. 6 offer further validation of the model in that the binding of HIV Env-expressing cells to cells expressing CD4 decreases substantially at 37 \u00b0C as predicted by the model. The Env trimer is stable up to at least 60 \u00b0C (Chuang et al., 2017) suggesting it is not denaturation of the Env trimer itself that is responsible for the decreased binding at higher temperatures. However, care has to be taken in using Eqs. (4) and (6) to predict \u0394Ha_receptor_T and \u0394Sa_receptor_T respectively down to very low temperatures. Thus although the predicted value of Kd_receptor_T for gp120:CD4 at 4 \u00b0C is 3700-fold lower than that at 37 \u00b0C (Table 4), Frey et al. (1995) cite some studies which suggested weaker binding of soluble CD4 to HIV virions at 4 \u00b0C compared to 37 \u00b0C. Without actual binding data for HIV over the full temperature range, it cannot be ruled out that Ka_virus_T does not exhibit a peak with temperature as for the WEEV binding in Fig. 3b. Indeed, binding of 125I-labelled gp120 to T cells peaked at 16 \u00b0C with binding at 4 \u00b0C much lower than that at 37 \u00b0C (Frey et al., 1995). The observed increase between 4 \u00b0C and 16 \u00b0C is unlikely to be due to increased fluidity of the membrane allowing recruitment of more CD4 molecules because unlike the virus, each gp120 only binds a single Cr molecule. Dimitrov et al. (1992) showed that the activation energy for binding of soluble CD4 to cells expressing HIV Env changed at 18 \u00b0C suggesting 18 \u00b0C is a transition temperature. This could explain the peak in binding of gp120 at 16 \u00b0C reported by Frey et al. (1995). Thus extrapolation of \u0394Ha_receptor_T and \u0394Sa_receptor_T through Eqs. (4) and (6), respectively to temperatures below 18 \u00b0C may not be justified in the case of HIV binding.",

The infection process may represent a bottleneck such that only one or two viral variants in the exposure dose successfully establish infection (Bull et al., 2011). Thus in the case of norovirus, only minor variants at frequencies as low as 0.01% were successfully transmitted to establish a new infection (Bull et al., 2012). The work here suggests that the actual size of the virion itself may present an additional constraint particularly at mammalian body temperatures. Thus although the average diameter for HIV virions with a single core is 134 nm, individual virions display a broad range of diameters extending from 120 to 200 nm with a skewed distribution (Briggs et al., 2003). Furthermore while the majority of HIV virions contained a single core, almost a third contained two or more cores. The mean diameter of the HIV virions containing a single core (134 \u00b1 11 nm, n = 89) was significantly smaller than the mean diameter of virions containing two cores (158 \u00b1 16 nm, n = 43) (Briggs et al., 2003). Thus the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob may vary between individual HIV virions within the same exposure dose. The key conclusion from Fig. 5c is that the number of CD4+\nT cells with bound virus is highly sensitive to the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob with just a 4.5% increase in the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob from \u2013290 to \u2013277 J/mol/K for example increasing C.VT by five-fold from 1 to 5 CD4+\nT cells per mm3 of blood at 37 \u00b0C. Thus smaller diameter viruses in a challenge does may have an advantage in binding and hence initiating infection at mammalian body temperatures. This also raises the question of the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob for an aggregate containing several virions of the same virus and in the case of EBOV, for the long filaments linking multiple genome copies (Beniac et al., 2012). It has previously been proposed that fusing multiple genome copies into the same filament in the case of EBOV takes some of the entropy loss for \u0394Sa_immob prior to binding to the cell surface (Gale 2017) such that aggregation can be viewed as a cooperative effect in the infection process. The effect of aggregation and virus size on the magnitude of \u0394Sa_immob according to Eq. (18) needs to be investigated and understood to further the work here.",

The relationship between binding affinity and temperature can be markedly affected by the change in heat capacity (\u0394Cp) on virus binding through its effect on the enthalpy and entropy of the GP/Cr interaction. Specifically large negative values of \u0394Cp reduce binding at both low and high temperatures giving a peak binding at a medium temperature as has been observed experimentally in binding of WEEV to mosquito midguts. Very large negative values of \u0394Cp for protein/protein GP/Cr interactions are predicted to diminish arbovirus transmission at low temperatures compared to the HA/SA glycan interaction for which \u0394Cp is negligible. Thus selecting for SA glycan interactions as reported for BTV binding may be a mechanism to allow transmission at the lower temperatures experienced by arboviruses infecting arthropods in temperate regions of the world.",

Small virion diameter through a less negative \u0394Sa_immob, favours virus binding at higher temperatures giving smaller viruses a selective advantage for infecting hosts at the higher body temperatures of mammals and birds. This is in agreement with the published observational findings that virus volume decreases with increasing host temperature in the case of dsDNA viruses.",

It is proposed here that non-specific binding of HIV as the virus first randomly attaches to a host CD4+\nT cell surface takes a large proportion (represented by \u0394Sa_non_specific) of the entropy loss of \u0394Sa_immob such that HIV can then bind specifically through Env:CD4 interactions at the relatively high temperature of the human body. The randomly attached virus \u201crolls into place\u201d driven by n = 3 specific Env:CD4 interactions resulting in a further entropy loss (\u0394Sa_specific) as the virus particle takes up a specific orientation ready for viral entry. Non-specific attachment factors are all the more important for a GP/Cr system such as the HIV Env:CD4 interaction for which \u0394Cp is large and negative and diminishes binding at higher temperatures.",

Bacterial cells are larger than viruses and \u0394Sa_immob would be expected to be more negative. Targeting \u0394Sa_immob may also have application as an alternative approach to antibiotics for bacterial pathogens when bacterial pathogenesis depends on attachment to cells. However, it should be noted that \u0394Sa_immob decreases logarithmically (i.e. slowly) with increasing size which may limit the practicability to bacteria.",
