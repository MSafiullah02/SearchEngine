            "text": "As discussed earlier, infections remain a leading cause of death worldwide, as well as in the United States [1]. Of concern, some of these infections are associated with vaccine preventable pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae, and influenza\n[1], [2], the morbidity and mortality of which could thus be significantly reduced or prevented were immunization rates higher, in both the developed and developing countries. In addition to well studied pathogens, novel and more virulent ones continue to be identified, that are capable of causing human and animal illness. These include various avian influenza strains [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], metapneumovirus [7], multidrug resistant tuberculosis [8], more aggressive coronaviruses [9], [10], [11], [12], and others. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is an underappreciated respiratory pathogen. While it is well known as the most common etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in children, resulting in nearly 2.1 million outpatient visits among those less than 5 years of age, and over 57,000 hospitalizations in the same cohort, it is estimated that RSV causes 177,000 hospitalizations, and 14,000 deaths among adults over 65 years of age [13], [14], [15]. RSV clinically is variable in presentation, referable to age, patient health and comorbidities. Young healthy individuals typically experience mild, cold-like symptoms, with recovery expected in one to two weeks. Infants present with bronchiolitis, adults mild upper respiratory infections (URI). Severe pneumonia may occur, especially the elderly who have comorbidities, and/or impaired cellular immunity. Aerosolized Ribavirin can be used for RSV in infants. Risk benefit must be balanced when considering the use of Ribavirin in adults.",

However, with the recent emergence of yet another highly pathogenic avian influenza - H7N9 [29], [30] and novel coronavirus (MERS CoV) which appears more deadly than SARS CoV [11], [12], it seems worthwhile to discuss these infectious agents. It is hoped that lessons learned from these latest outbreaks can be applied towards preparedness against a wide range of pulmonary threats, and enhance our infection control capacity.",
