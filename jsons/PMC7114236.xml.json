Simultaneously, the disease emerged in the USA with a similar impact on pig production (Cho and Dee, 2006). Genetic and antigenic comparisons of viruses in Europe and North America showed that PRRS virus segregates into the European (EU) and the North American (NA) genotypes (Allende et al., 1999). A high degree of variability has been demonstrated within both genotypes (Stadejek et al., 2008). Historically, EU and NA genotype viruses have been restricted to the respective continents.",

However, it has also been reported to have appeared in other countries such as Italy, Austria, Poland and Hungary, where the NA genotype vaccine is not authorised (Botner et al., 1997, Storgaard et al., 1999, Martelli, 2002, Indik et al., 2005, Oleksiewicz et al., 2005, Balka et al., 2008, Lillie et al., 2008). Although a basic requirement of live vaccine virus strains is that natural transmission of vaccine virus is minimal or non-existent (Mateu and Diaz, 2008), this widespread appearance of NA vaccine viruses across Europe raises the suspicion that it is spreading independently from vaccination (Botner et al., 1997, Oleksiewicz et al., 1998).",

However, a full description of the herd factors and practices which might have influenced vaccine spread was not in the scope of this paper. Due to the hierarchical nature of the data (one or several pigs submitted per farm), the expected clustering effect had to be corrected for both the prevalence estimation and the regression analysis. This was achieved by using the respective modules offered by the software package (STATA). Without such adjustment, confidence intervals might have been too narrow and P-values too low, leading to effect overestimation. We therefore consider our results to be less biased and rather conservative.",

For PRRS virus isolates it is generally accepted that if two isolates have a nucleotide identity in the ORF5 gene \u226598% they are closely related (Collins, 1999). Therefore it can be assumed that these isolates are derived from the Porcilis\u00ae PRRS strain. The marked differences in sequence identity between isolates categorised either as DV vaccine (\u226599.1%) or wild-type (\u226491.7%) showed that misclassification of recombinant or mutated vaccine strain isolates probably not have impaired the results of this study.",

As NA genotype PRRS virus was not indigenous in Germany until introduced with the vaccine, the high nucleotide identities with the Ingelvac\u00ae PRRS MLV suggest that they are derivatives of this vaccine. Interestingly, 9 of the isolates had nucleotide identities only between 96.0 and 97.8% with the ORF5 of Ingelvac\u00ae PRRS MLV. This reflects the continuous mutations of the viral genome (Allende et al., 2000, Goldberg et al., 2003).
