It causes important economic losses to the beef and dairy industry worldwide (Boileau and Kapil, 2010, Vlasova and Saif, 2014). Serological surveys indicate that approximately 90% of the worldwide cattle population has antibodies (Abs) against BCoV (Lin et al., 1996). Also, detection of similar CoV strains among wild ruminants, dogs and horses, with evidence for experimental interspecies transmission to calves, suggests that these species could harbor CoVs transmissible to cattle or vice versa (Barros et al., 2013, Saif, 2010).",

            "text": "The virus genome is comprised of single stranded non-segmented positive-sense RNA (32 kb) associated to the nucleoprotein (N) and forming a nucleocapsid with helical symmetry (Clark, 1993). Viral particles are large (100\u2013150 nm), pleomorphic and enveloped with four major structural proteins comprising a membrane (M) glycoprotein, an envelope (E) protein, a spike (S) glycoprotein and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein (Lai, 2001). It is interesting to note that the hemagglutinating activity of the HE from BCoVs strains is lower than the hemagglutinating activity of the S glycoprotein, which forms large spike-like projections in the viral envelope (Schultze et al., 1991). Moreover, the S glycoprotein harbors domains responsible for receptor binding and induction of neutralizing antibodies, and is the most polymorphic viral protein among CoV species and also among strains of the same species. It is utilized for the molecular characterization of the isolates (Collins et al., 1982). The S glycoprotein consists of two subunits, S1 (N-terminal half) and S2 (C-terminal half). The S1 hypervariable region is useful to study the variability and evolution of this virus (Brandao et al., 2006, Hasoksuz et al., 2002).",

In contrast, little epidemiological information is available regarding BCoV detection, incidence and characterization in cattle from Central and South American countries. In Cuba, BCoV sequences clustered with BCoV strains from USA, suggesting a common origin for these viruses (Martinez et al., 2012). In South America, most of the information comes from studies conducted in Brazil (Asano et al., 2010, Barros et al., 2013, Brandao et al., 2008, Brandao et al., 2006, Takiuchi et al., 2008). Stipp et al. (2009) reported a 15.6% detection rate of BCoV in diarrheic calves from dairy and beef farms during a survey conducted in four states of Brazil. Phylogenetic studies based on the hypervariable region of the S glycoprotein gene indicated that Brazilian BCoV strains belong to two different clusters, suggesting that at least two different BCoV strains are circulating in Brazil (Brandao et al., 2006, Takiuchi et al., 2008). Interestingly, some BCoV strains detected in Brazil showed a gap of 18 nucleotides (nt 1577\u20131594; aa 461\u2013570) in the hypervariable region within the S1 encoding gene, giving rise to a paraphyletic group in the evolution of BCoV circulating in Brazil. Similar gaps were also reported in porcine and human CoV strains causing respiratory disease. The presence of this gap in the S protein from swine CoVs has been associated with a change from enteric to respiratory tropism (Saif and Sestak, 2006, St-Jean et al., 2004).",

All samples were run in duplicate. Briefly, serial four-fold dilutions of each sample diluted in MEM-E + MEM-D (50% each), supplemented with 1% of penicillin\u2013streptomycin and 2 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Germany) were mixed with equal volume of a virus suspension containing 200 FFU and incubated at 37 \u00b0C during 1 h. Then, 100 \u03bcl of the sample-virus mixtures were transferred onto 100% confluent HRT-18 monolayers placed in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture sterile plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with during 48 h in a 0.5% CO2 atmosphere. After incubation, the plates were fixed using 150 \u03bcl/well of 70% acetone in distillated water during 15 min followed by a drying period of 1\u20132 h at room temperature. Finally, the neutralization was revealed using a fluorescein-labeled CoVB Mebus-specific guinea pig polyclonal antiserum made in our laboratory, diluted 1/100 in Evans Blue dye and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The plates were washed three times with PBS buffer and kept at 4 \u00b0C until visualization under fluorescent microscope. The VN Ab titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest sample dilution (log 10) that reduced the number of fluorescent foci by >80% compared with the wells with the virus suspension containing 100 FFU (virus without sample).",

Other possible explanations for this result could be the lower sensitivity of ELISA compared with RT-PCR assay (Cho et al., 2001a). However, in a survey conducted in Turkey during 2001\u20132002 using the same indirect antigen-capture ELISA, the BCoV detection rate was 28.1% (Hasoksuz et al., 2005), suggesting that BCoV-associated diarrhea in Argentinean calves may be lower than in other countries.",

Dairy calves are separated from their dams after colostrums intake and are feed with milk replacer lacking Abs. This management system increases the risk of neonatal calf diarrhea compared with beef calves, which live with their dams up to six month old with natural feeding (Bendali et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The results obtained in the phylogenetic analysis, raise the question if the vaccines currently available in Argentina (all including Mebus strain) are protective against the BCoV strains circulating in the field. To evaluate the potential efficacy of Mebus-induced Abs to neutralize BCoV field strains, we conducted a two-way in vitro virus neutralization assay using the Mebus strain and the Arg95 field isolate, adapted to grow in HRT-18 cells. The results showed that Mebus and Arg95 Abs (avian IgY and guinea pig IgG) were equally able to neutralize both BCoV strains. This confirms the asseveration that all BCoV are antigenically similar, comprising a single serotype (Hasoksuz et al., 1999a, Hasoksuz et al., 1999b, Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995). Similarly, Cho et al. (2001a) showed that calves inoculated with calf diarrhea associated CoV, bovine respiratory CoV and winter dysentery CoV did not develop diarrhea or respiratory disease but showed subclinical BCoV infection after homologous or heterologous virus challenge. Also, Han et al. (2006) noted that gnotobiotic calves experimentally inoculated with a human CoV were protected from diarrhea after being challenged with CD-BCoV DB2. All this data suggest that current vaccines available in Argentina, which include the Mebus strain, should be effective to prevent neonatal BCoV associated diarrhea. However, there are still no animal models for BCoV vaccine potency testing in Argentina that could demonstrate this. In conclusion, it will be important to continue the epidemiological surveys of BCoV circulating strains associated with diarrhea and respiratory disease in cattle, as well to develop prevention strategies to control BCoV diarrhea, including the study of vaccine potency and the development of oral passive therapies.",
