After the lockdown of Wuhan on January 14, 2020, the patient experienced a short treatment delay. On Feb 10, she complained of a slight dry cough, but without any other symptoms covering fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and myalgia. Whereafter, she resumed hospitalization for the second-line chemotherapy due to a poor control of CA-125. On March 21, routing admitted screening of COVID-19 showed her serological IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was positive, but serological IgM antibodies, chest computed tomography (CT) (See figure 1) and throat swab reverse J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 were all negative. Subsequently, she was receiving a supportive therapy of elevating platelets due to the chemotherapy-related grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Case 2: A 51-year-old female patient diagnosed with stage IIA cervical squamous cell carcinomas has completed 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy. During the outbreak, the patient suffered a treatment interruption of approximately one month. She reported a single symptom of mild fatigue on Feb 14, but spontaneous recovery one day later. Upon the admission screening on March 22, she was tested positive for serological IgG antibodies alone as well as negative for both chest CT (See figure 1) and throat swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The patient was currently undergoing pelvic radiation therapy as an inpatient. Their treatment history was summarized in figure 2.According to experts' consultation, the two patients were confirmed as previously asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. After admission, they were respectively placed to a single ward and tested for serum antibody for three consecutive times each day, all of which showed only IgG positive but IgM negative. To investigate the risk of transmission, we further screened their family members, and subsequent laboratory assay including throat swab SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serological antibody tests, and chest CT scan, were all negative. According to their accounts, even during quarantine at home, they were given strict protective measures, such as living in separate room, enhancing indoor ventilation and disinfection, reducing family gathering, when going out and washing their hands frequently, in consideration of possible susceptibility caused by cancer history. Until discharge, no new nosocomial infection occurred between patients and health care workers in our department.",

However, according current studies, some of asymptomatic carriers may harbor some transient, reversible symptoms, which would be confused with those lung inherent disorders.
