It begins with a brief overview of influenza viruses, followed by a concise statement on the dimensions of the pandemic threat. A discussion of the effectiveness of influenza vaccination is next, followed by a summary of the global use of influenza vaccines. Then comes a discussion of basic considerations for producing adequate supplies of pandemic vaccines, a review of the scientific basis for their development and registration and an outline of current activities in the United States and Europe. The closely related issue of reverse genetics (RG) and intellectual property is also considered. The article closes with suggestions for an international policy agenda for pandemic vaccine development. Antiviral agents will be important for the prevention and control of pandemic influenza, but they are outside the scope of this article and will not be discussed.",

The influenza virus genome consists of eight RNA segments that code for 10 proteins: two envelope glycoproteins-the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens-matrix protein (M1), nucleoprotein (NP), three polymerases (PB1, PB2 and PA), an ion channel protein (M2) and two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). Type A viruses that cause epidemics in man are classified according to the HA (H1, H2 and H3) and NA (N1 and N2) antigens. Point mutations in the HA and less frequently NA antigens lead to antigenic drift that is characteristic of interpandemic years. Sudden substitutions of whole genes from one subtype to another lead to the antigenic shifts that are the hallmark of new pandemics.",

However, we do know that this year B70% of human cases of avian H5N1 influenza died, far worse than the case-fatality rate seen in the 1918 pandemic.

This was more than twice the 135 million doses distributed a decade earlier (DS Fedson, unpublished observation).

(In Europe, a Swiss company markets influenza vaccine, but it obtains its bulk vaccine virus from a vaccine company located in Australia.) In 2003, these nine countries had only 12% of the world's population, yet they used 62% and produced X95% of the world's influenza vaccine. Almost none of the vaccine produced in Canada, Japan and the United States was exported to other countries. Four companies located in the five Western European countries produced 190 million doses, 65% of the world's supply. Excluding 13.8 million doses produced in Hungary, Romania and Russia (all of which were distributed domestically), these five countries produced almost all of the 79 million doses of influenza vaccine that were used in countries outside Western Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia and Japan (Table 1) .",

The strategy is based on using a lower dose of HA antigen and including an adjuvant in the vaccine. The initial studies were conducted using a proprietary MF59 adjuvant (26) (27) (28) (29) , but later studies used a simple alum adjuvant-the kind widely available and used by all vaccine companies that produce childhood vaccines (30, 31) . Vaccines against H2, H5 and H9 ''pandemic-like'' viruses have been tested. Both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines have been produced using both whole virus and subunit virus preparations (32, 33) . They have been formulated with concentrations of HA antigen as low as 1.875 mg per dose (30, 31) . A single injection of one of these low-dose vaccines primes the recipient and a second dose, usually given 3 weeks later, leads to the development of protective levels of antibodies when measured after another 3 weeks.",

Previous studies have shown that vaccinating healthy younger (34) and older (35) adults with non-adjuvanted vaccines containing increasing amounts of HA antigen (up to 135 mg HA per dose) is associated with higher and more persistent antibody levels, albeit with more frequent local adverse reactions. Although higher doses of HA antigen offer better immunogenicity for individuals, these studies were conducted in subjects who already had had immunological experience with the virus subtypes included in the trial vaccines. Consequently, the results cannot be extrapolated to the circumstances of a new pandemic. Moreover, a recent study in immunologically naive younger adults showed that two doses of a nonadjuvanted ''pandemic-like'' H9N2 vaccine containing 30 mg HA was poorly immunogenic and would leave most people unprotected in the event of an H9N2 pandemic (32) .",

Companies have been asked to develop prototype ''mock-up'' vaccines during the interpandemic period. These vaccines must contain viral antigens to which humans have not been previously exposed (e.g., H5N1). Each company must conduct clinical trials of its ''mock-up'' vaccine to determine the antigen dosage and vaccination schedule for its vaccine and establish its safety. The core dossier must document the production process for the vaccine and its final formulation. Once this is done, the company can obtain a marketing authorization for its ''mock-up'' vaccine. When a pandemic threat is declared and a true pandemic vaccine needs to be produced, only quality data related to the pandemic variation need to be submitted to the EMEA. Each pandemic variation will receive a ''fast track'' assessment and approval within 3 days and an EU decision within another 24 h (39, 40) . Approval will be given with the understanding that companies will gather safety, immunogenicity and effectiveness data on their pandemic vaccines during clinical use (39) .
