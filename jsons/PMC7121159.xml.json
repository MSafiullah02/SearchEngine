Animals come in contact with humans or other animals as they range (e.g. cows and chickens in parts of Asia) or browse (e.g. urban foxes and rodents) (Bradley and Altizer 2007). The continued high rate of contact between humans and poultry in both smaller backyard farms and larger market system farms continues to permit repeated human exposure to the H5N1 influenza A virus that is endemic in poultry stock. Children and adults are thought to have been infected by contact with living chickens in backyards, and adults have been shown to become infected at some point during the process of raising or slaughtering/butchering chickens (Kerkhove et al. 2011).",

Prevention of infectious disease emergence through the food chain and agricultural system requires understanding of the risks at each step along the pathway from the farm to the fork. If infectious agents pass through the food chain and enter foods, their impact can be minimized at the final intervention point, where animal-derived foods can be prepared carefully in the factory, restaurant, and household either by cooking or other means to remove or mitigate the risk of infection.

The frequency of leptospira transmission from rodents to humans has been shown to increase during events in Latin America, Bangladesh, and India following heavy rains and flooding (Lau et al. 2010).

Though there is still much debate within the scientific community as to the contribution of antibiotics in farming systems to the rise of antibiotic resistance, the implications on emerging antibiotic resistance in human populations is even less well understood (Barton 2000). But there is general consensus that farming systems are likely to contribute to the flow of antibiotic residues and resistant microbes in the wider ecosystem and in humans by runoff into water used or consumed by humans, especially in economically poor settings where farming communities exist alongside densely populated human environments with poor sanitation/sewage systems (Abraham 2011; Segura et al. 2009). Clearly, cross-sector action is required to mitigate these risks using the example of the connection between antimicrobial resistance in both animal and human sectors provides a key lesson for ensuring interdisciplinary planning is incorporated when designing zoonotic control strategies.",

There is a great amount of scientific knowledge about the risk factors of emergence and their mitigation already available from previous investigation and risk assessment. Much more can be obtained from in-depth study of each emergence event as it occurs. Research must also take into account human behavior, and ensure that populations most at risk clearly understand the measures required to reduce or protect behavior that is high risk.
