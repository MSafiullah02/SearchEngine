The option selected depends upon anatomic factors, previous surgery, the extent of corrosive injury to esophagus and stomach and surgical expertise of the surgeon [3].

Twelve patients (12.90%) with corrosive injury, who had relatively good health, required total parenteral nutrition through a central venous line for weight optimization for a short period before surgery. The remaining 13 (13.97%) patients,(4 CES, 2 tumor, 6 corrosive, 1 Cardiac achalasia) were on oral nutrition as they were in relatively better health and was still able to take nutrition orally. They were directly subjected to replacement surgery. Feeding jejunostomy was preferred method for nutritional support in corrosive stricture patients if needed, as we wanted to spare the stomach for pull up. These are the patients who had weight less then 70th percentile for age and had esophageal strictures that were non-negotiable on dilatation and unable to take orally. Feeding gastrostomy was preferred in esophageal atresia patients, as jejunostomy was considered unsafe in the neonatal age group. All these patients were discussed with nutritionist and case-specific diet plan and response was monitored during fallow up visits.",

            "text": "After optimization, these patients underwent esophageal replacement. Three patients underwent primary gastric pull-up. These are patients with isolated long gap esophageal atresia. The most common conduit was stomach as gastric pull-up based on right gastric and right gastro-epiploic vessels and next common conduit was colonic interposition, based on middle colic artery (right colon-isoperistaltic). The commonly used route was trans-hiatal route (80 patients) either isolated this route (71 patients) or combined with thoracotomy (9 patients) in difficult cases. Table 1 describes the details of conduits utilized and routes of replacement in our series. Our preferred conduit was gastric pull-up (84 patients). Next preference was colon (7 patients) if not available then we used jejunum in two patients. Additionally, in one patient pyloroplasty was done, whereas in 45 (48.39%) patients of gastric pull-up, pyloromyotomy was done to avoid hold up in the chest. Moreover, we used a GIA linear cutter/stapler for gastroesophageal junction excision in all cases of gastric pull-up. Whenever the transhiatal route was used native esophagus was removed, however, where retrosternal route was used esophagus was left in situ (Fig. 1). The fundus was then anastomosed with the upper esophageal pouch. In one patient with jejunal interposition, the lower esophagus and stomach both were very scarred due to corrosive fibrosis; therefore, a roux-en-y loop of jejunum was pulled-up to the chest and anastomosed with the upper esophagus in the chest because the vascular arcade of jejunum posed difficulty in the procedure. In one case of colonic interposition using the retrosternal route, the lower end of colon had to be anastomosed with jejunum due to complete scarring of the stomach. In another patient with a corrosive long esophageal stricture along with gastric antral/pyloric stricture (who developed complete re-stenosis after pyloroplasty), colonic interposition through the retrosternal route was performed with anterior wall of stomach along with gastroduodenostomy to bypass the pylorus (Fig. 2). In three patients with retrosternal route, the manubrium sterni was also removed per operatively due to compression on the conduit. This is based on the finding that two patients with dysphagia after esophageal replacement improved after resection of the manubrium sterni. Accordingly, in the following cases using the retrosternal route we made this standard that when the thoracic inlet is too tight that even two fingers can not be negotiated (subject to author\u2019s assessment) manubrial resection should be done. In nine cases, the chest had to be opened in patients with CES, tumor, cardiac achalasia and one for technical difficulty due to either fibrosis secondary to corrosive ingestion and one due to injury to the aorta. One patient was referred from another hospital with dehisced colonic interposition. This patient was operated by median sternotomy and re-anastomosis with both upper esophagus and colon was performed. In eight patients, anastomosis was performed in the chest (four CES and two tumors done using a partial gastric pull-up, and two jejujnal replacement for caustic stricture). In 85 patients, the anastomosis was performed in the neck.",

            "text": "Table 2 describes early and late per/postoperative complications in our series. Per operatively, we have encountered one aortic arch injury, which was dealt with help of cardiac surgeon after open thoracotomy. Postoperatively, various complications were encountered. Common early complications were pneumothorax in 10 (10.75%) (3 on table and 7 in early postoperative period), anastomotic leak in 9 (9.68%) [3 in chest (one with jejunal transposition, 2 with partial gastric pull-up) and 6 in neck], and wound infection in 10 (10.75%) patients. The pneumothorax was dealt with tube thoracostomy. Anastomotic leaks (nine patients) were managed conservatively; out of those, seven healed ultimately. Wound infection was dealt with daily dressings and wound management. One patient who presented with anastomotic stricture needed median sternotomy and revision of anastomosis 5 years after the previous gastric pull-up through retrosternal route. Three more patients with anastomotic stricture with gastric pull up needed revision of anastomosis in neck, years after initial replacement surgery. One of these was operated 7 years after initial replacement, succumbed to death due to aspiration. Rest of patients with anastomotic strictures, were dealt with anastomotic dilatation with metallic/gum elastic bougies. In two patients, the manubrium was contributing to the postoperative dysphagia so manubrium sterni was removed afterward. One of patient with colonic transplant had signs of obstruction in the early postoperative period and on exploration revealed internal herniation in leftover defect of mesentery. We encountered one case of colonic dilatation post-operatively where we performed a re-do surgery. However, no case of gastric dilatation was seen in our series. So our four patients needed revision of anastomosis, one through median sternotomy. Dumping syndrome was observed in eight patients (8.6%) of gastric pull-up and all of these patients had pyloromyotomy as additional procedure. In our experience, there was no difference of gastric content hold up with or without pyloromyotomy; it was associated with dumping syndrome in eight patients. Patients with reflux were managed medically.",

A host of conditions and diseases may require esophageal replacement such as long gap esophageal atresia, non-dilatable long esophageal corrosive strictures, more than 3\u20135 cm long congenital esophageal stenosis, and esophageal tumors [5]. In our series, the main indications of esophageal replacements were corrosive intake in 76.34% patients followed by esophageal atresia (19.35%), congenital esophageal stenosis (4.30%) and esophageal tumors (2.15%). Garritano et al. performed a systemic review of the literature on pediatric esophageal replacement and found the most common reason for replacement was esophageal atresia followed by corrosive injury [6]. Also Soccorso and Dilshad et al. reported esophageal atresia and peptic disease as common indication for esophageal replacement [1, 7]. These reports are contrary to our findings where majority of the patients belonged to corrosive ingestion and esophageal atresia was the second common etiology. This is due to lack of awareness among local community for safety measures regarding handling of corrosive material as compared to the developed countries where public awareness and industry collaborations have markedly reduced the incidence of corrosive injuries [1].",

            "text": "The commonly practiced conduits for esophageal replacement are colonic interposition, gastric pull-up, gastric tube interposition, jejunal interposition and jejunal free graft. The replacement can be performed through the esophageal hiatus, transthoracic, retrosternal, and occasionally through subcutaneous route. All the above mentioned conduit and routes used for replacement in literature have their own advantages and disadvantage. Choice is mainly depends upon patient\u2019s anatomy, available structures and surgical expertise. We preferred gastric-pull up (> 90% of the patients) in our series, because of its technical advantages over other techniques in addition to our extensive experience for this procedure. It is because of the straight forward mobilization of stomach, with the blood supply based on the right gastric and right gastroepiploic vessels, and does not involve multiple anastomoses, thus the risk of anastomotic leakage is low. These factors have a direct impact on patient\u2019s morbidity and mortality. Although 6 patients developed anastomotic leakage in the neck, all were managed conservatively with free salivary drainage. We have a limited experience with colonic interposition (seven cases) and jejunal interposition (two cases) in patients with scarred stomach. In one patient we faced colonic dilatation and in cases of jejunal interposition, we encountered difficulty in bringing up the jejunum owing to its limited vascular arcade as endorsed by Giampiero and Dakeshesh [1]. These were the other reasons that we preferred gastric pull-up procedure. According to Spitz et al. [8] and Delshad et al. [7], esophageal replacement with complete stomach is the ideal procedure because it has low complication rate, however, Delshad et al. and others have noted that colon interposition is still the commonest practiced method for esophageal replacement in the world literature [6, 7, 9\u201312]. Hirschl et al. [13] reported that a colon interposition is a more complex endeavor than a gastric transposition. Other studies conclude that gastric pull-up is the procedure of choice for centers in Europe and the United States [14]. Similarly, in our series, we had gastric pull-up for the majority of our patients [6, 8, 14\u201318].",

In one case we had aortic tear at the level of arch of aorta during surgery, which was managed by open thoracotomy with the help of our cardiac surgeon. Other intraoperative complication encountered were related to operative difficulty in esophagectomy owing to massive adhesion with the surrounding structures and bleeding, which were dealt with by opening the chest. The most common early postoperative complications in this series were pneumothorax in 10.75% of cases, leak in 9.68% of patients, wound infection and dehiscence in 16.12% of patients, and one patient had internal herniation. Pneumothorax was commonly seen with trans-hiatal route and identified either on table or after shifting to surgical ICU and managed with immediate chest intubation. In several patients, we deliberately passed chest tube fearing a pneumothorax especially in cases with difficult esophagectomy owing to adhesions. Almost same incidence of pneumothorax (10\u201314%), was reported in the literature. [18\u201320] In our series second common early complication was anastomotic leak (9.68%). Our results were comparable with Bradshaw et al. [19] who encountered anastomotic leak in 14% of patients. Awad et al. noted it in 20% of his patients [21]. Choudhury et al.

According to a systemic review, anastomotic leak with gastric pull up was seen in 22.8% while with colonic transposition in 19.7% of cases [20].",
