            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family. It is an important infectious disease agent in pigs worldwide, causing reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory problems in young piglets. In vivo, PRRSV replicates primarily in alveolar macrophages but has also been shown to replicate in blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in vitro. 1 The course of infection includes an acute viraemic stage, lasting approximately 1 month, followed by a chronic stage in which viraemia resolves, but virus can still be isolated from secondary lymphoid tissues. 2 Virus has been repor-ted to persist in some animals for months, with and without shedding. 3, 4 During the course of disease, anti-PRRSV antibody can be detected by a week postinfection; however, neutralizing antibodies do not appear until 4 weeks postinfection or later. 5 Cell-mediated immunity, measured as antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation, is not detected until 4 weeks after infection. 6, 7 Antigen-specific gamma interferon (IFN-c) secreting T cells can be measured at 2 weeks postinfection, but this response is quite variable among animals 8 and can take nearly 6 months to peak. 9 Attenuated PRRSV vaccines have been shown to prevent morbidity associated with disease and provide protection when pigs are challenged with a homologous strain of the virus. 10 However, vaccination does not prevent disease Crystal L. Loving, 1,2 Susan L. Brockmeier 2 and Randy E. Sacco 1,2 1 Summary Dendritic cells (DCs) play a role in anti-viral immunity by providing early innate protection against viral replication and by presenting antigen to T cells for initiation of the adaptive immune response. Studies show the adaptive response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is ineffective for complete viral elimination. Other studies describe the kinetics of the adaptive response to PRRSV, but have not investigated the early response by DCs. We hypothesize that there is an aberrant activation of DCs early in PRRSV infection; consequently, the adaptive response is triggered inadequately. The current study characterized a subtype of porcine lung DCs (L-DCs) and investigated the ability of PRRSV to infect and replicate in L-DCs and monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). Furthermore, the type I interferon anti-viral response to PRRSV with and without the addition of recombinant porcine IFN-a (rpIFN-a), an important cytokine that signals for anti-viral mediator activation, was analysed. Results show that PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, providing evidence that these cells have followed distinct differentiation pathways. Although both cell types responded to PRRSV with an induction of IFN-b mRNA, the magnitude and duration of the response differed between cell types. The addition of rpIFN-a was protective in MDDCs, and mRNA synthesis of Mx (myxovirus resistant) and PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase) was observed in both cell types after rpIFN-a addition. Overall, PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, and rpIFN-a was required for the transcription of protective anti-viral mediators. DC response to PRRSV was limited to IFN-b transcription, which may be inadequate in triggering the adaptive immune response. nor protect against heterologous strains of the virus. 11 Overall, the early adaptive immune response to PRRSV is weak and results in delayed elimination of virus from the host. 12 Unprotected healthy animals may acquire virus from non-clinical shedders 13 and infected animals can become susceptible to secondary infections. 14, 15 Type I interferon (IFN-a/b) is critical for innate control of virus replication as well as activation of the adaptive immune response. 16 Upon viral invasion, IFN-a/b is synthesized, secreted, and signals through the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR), inducing transcription of several anti-viral mediators, including PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase) and Mx (myxovirus resistant; IFN-inducible GTPase). Viral stimulation, independent of interferon signalling, can also stimulate the expression of various anti-viral proteins through the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and other undescribed signalling pathways. 17 PKR, Mx and other anti-viral proteins function to hinder viral replication by blocking protein translation or altering cell signalling. 18 Once produced, IFN-a/b can induce dendritic cell (DC) maturation 19 and act as a survival factor for activated T cells. 20, 21 DC maturation in response to double-stranded RNA or viral infection requires IFN-a/b 22 and IFN-a/b stimulates resistance in DCs to viral cytopathic effects. 23 Several DNA and RNA viruses are capable of infecting DCs and have adapted mechanisms to modulate the host response. 24 These studies, and others, indicate an important role for IFN-a/b during an immune response.",

Studies are needed to investigate the innate response of DCs to PRRSV as well as to identify ways in which the virus can interfere with host defences. This is important for understanding PRRSV-induced pathogenesis and for the development of protective vaccines. Evidence, as discussed previously, suggests that the early adaptive immune response to PRRSV is suboptimal and we hypothesize that this is due to the lack of IFN-a/b production by DCs after infection. Thus, the following study investigated the susceptibility of MDDCs and L-DCs to PRRSV, assessed type I interferon activation after infection and investigated the protective effects of IFN-a on both DC populations.",

Peripheral blood was drawn from the cranial vena cava and animals were subsequently euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital given intravenously. The pulmonary vasculature was flushed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove peripheral blood. This was accomplished by exposing the thoracic viscera and clamping the trachea and double-clamping the oesophagus and caudal vena cava before severing to avoid gross contamination of the lung. The pulmonary artery was clamped, a cannula was inserted distal to the clamp, and the vasculature was flushed with 300 ml of sterile PBS that was allowed to drain through the severed aorta. The lungs were subsequently removed and the airways were lavaged with 200 ml of sterile PBS to eliminate cells in the airways.

Morphological features from transmission electron micrographs showed L-DCs had a large nucleus, scant cytoplasm and dendritic cell processes, and similar traits were observed in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) (Fig. 1) . The surface phenotype of MDDCs and L-DCs was determined using flow cytometry. Scatter profiles (Fig. 2) indicated that L-DCs and MDDCs were forward scatter high. L-DCs were more granular and complex than MDDCs (high orthogonal profile). As shown previously, 27 MDDCs were MHC class I + , MHC class II + and CR4(CD11c) + (Fig. 2b , data not shown). MDDCs also expressed CD16, CD14 and low levels of CD80/86 (Fig. 2b ) similar to that described for porcine bone marrow-derived DCs. 33 L-DCs, which were sorted on CR4(CD11c), expressed MHC class I and CD80/86. More than 50% of L-DCs were MHC class II + and CD16 + , with only a small fraction expressing CD14 (Fig. 2a) . In addition, MDDCs and L-DCs were CD172a + and CD1 + (data not shown), the expression of which has been useful in distinguishing porcine DCs from other leucocyte populations, such as macrophages. 28 DCs are distinguished as antigen-processing and -presenting cells by the specialized uptake of small molecules via defined pathways, including receptor-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Antigen uptake was assessed in L-DCs, MDDCs and AMFs using tracer endocytosis. For this assay, the uptake of fluorescently labelled antigens (dextran, LPS and ovalbumin) was determined by flow cytometry. L-DCs were able to take up all antigen types tested (Fig. 3a) . In L-DCs, ovalbumin antigen uptake was the greatest and only low amounts of LPS were taken up. Although MDDC uptake of dextran and LPS was minimal, MDDCs were still able to uptake anti-gen via receptor-mediated endocytosis, as noted by uptake of ovalbumin to quantities similar to L-DCs (Fig. 3a) . Tracer endocytosis observed for AMFs was similar to that seen with MDDCs (data not shown).",

Responder cells (CD3 + ) were labelled with the fluorochrome 5,6 carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) to assess proliferation of these cells. 34 As the parent population proliferates, the dye is distributed equally to daughter cells and fluorescence decreases.

Extracellular levels of live PRRSV and vRNA increased significantly by 12 hr postinfection in MDDCs and peaked at 24 hr (Fig. 5b) . The amount of extracellular live virus or vRNA measured over time did not change when rpIFN-a was added to MDDCs at the time of virus inoculation (Fig. 5b,d) , indicating a protective effect of IFN-a. Levels of virus did not change over time in L-DCs when measured by titration or real-time PCR, demonstrating that PRRSV did not replicate in these cells. However, the addition of rpIFN-a inhibited the ability to detect live virus in supernatant from L-DCs (Fig. 5a) . This difference was not detected when virus was quantified by real-time PCR, indicating that vRNA levels in the supernatant did not change (Fig. 5c,d) . Overall, these data show that PRRSV replicated in MDDCs, but not in L-DCs, and that IFN-a can inhibit PRRSV replication in permissive cells. Figure 6 shows L-DCs and MDDCs responded to PRRSV with increased transcription of IFN-b. At 12 hr there was an average 25-fold increase in IFN-b mRNA levels in PRRSV treated DCs compared to mock infected cells with significantly higher (P < 0\u00c105) levels seen in MDDCs. By 24 hr postinfection, the amount IFN-b mRNA had decreased in L-DCs, but remained significantly (P < 0\u00c105) higher in MDDCs. L-DCs treated with polyIC showed similar transcription of IFN-b as when treated with PRRSV (Fig. 6a) . However, stimulation of L-DCs with swine influenza virus (SIV) or PRCV did not induce changes in any mRNA transcripts measured in these studies. Overall, L-DC transcription in response to any viral stimulus used was limited to IFN-b, which occurred only when exposed to PRRSV or polyIC. There was no alteration in IFN-a, Mx or PKR transcript in either cell type when stimulated with polyIC or PRRSV only. The amount of Mx or PKR mRNA increased only in cells treated with rpIFN-a and levels were similar even when PRRSV was present. These data suggested that PRRSV did not hinder the anti-viral response induced by IFN-a. The magnitude of increased Mx (P < 0\u00c105) and PKR was greater in MDDCs than that of L-DCs and was sustained in MDDCs over time, indicating that MDDCs may be more responsive to IFN-a than L-DCs. At 12 hr poststimulation, IFN-b levels in L-DCs treated with PRRSV or PRRSV plus rpIFN-a were higher than when stimulated with rpIFN-a only. The addition of rpIFN-a did not appear to induce IFN-b transcription in L-DCs, but instead IFN-b was elevated mainly in response to PRRSV. By 24 hr poststimulation, L-DC IFN-b mRNA levels were near baseline in cells treated with both PRRSV plus rpIFN-a, but not in cells treated with only PRRSV. L-DCs stimulated with polyIC or PRRSV only still had increased levels of IFN-b mRNA (Fig. 6a) ",

PRRSV has a restricted tropism for subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages and various stages of differentiation and activation affects the susceptibility of these cells. 35 It has been shown that macrophages residing in different locations of the body show different susceptibility to PRRSV. 36 MDDCs and tissue DCs follow distinct differentiation pathways and, consequently, differ in response to various stimuli. 37, 38 The MDDCs used in this experiment exhibited phenotypic (MHC dim , CD80/86 dim ) and functional (ovalbumin uptake) characteristics of immature dendritic cells, which may have a played a role in PRRSV susceptibility. Of note, phenotypic analysis suggests that the L-DC population may contain immature (MHC dim/neg , CD80/86 dim ) and mature (MHC hi , CD80/86 hi ) cells. However, L-DCs displayed functional characteristics (dextran and ovalbumin uptake) of immature DCs. Therefore, it is difficult to determine from these studies if DC maturity has a role in susceptibility to PRRSV infection. It is possible that MDDCs display morphological, phenotypic and functional characteristics of DCs, but retain lineage characteristics of monocytes or macrophages that leave them susceptible to PRRSV. Although PRRSV infection or replication in L-DCs was not detected using described methods, PRRSV did alter L-DC phenotype. PolyIC, a synthetic double-stranded RNA representing an intermediate of viral replication, did not induce changes in MHC-I expression, whereas PRRSV induced a decrease in MHC-I expression. In addition, CD80/86 expression increased in the majority of polyIC-stimulated cells but did not change in PRRSVtreated cells. On the other hand, SIV did not alter MHC-I or CD80/86 expression. Thus, the modulation of activation antigens observed is unique to PRRSV. The addition of rpIFN-a with PRRSV counteracted the negative effects of the virus by inducing an increase in both MHC-I and CD80/86. Although this modulation of MHC-I expression did not translate into changes in the mixed leucocyte reaction, this does not preclude the possibility that the decrease in MHC-I expression could result in an altered PRRSV antigen-specific presentation in vivo.",

Virus recognition between these two cell types may have occurred through different, but overlapping, mechanisms that resulted in differential IFN-b transcription. Virus can be detected by the specific interaction of envelope glycoproteins with host cell-surface expressed receptors and/or detection of viral genome by endosomal TLRs 22 and it has been shown that the induction of IFN-a/b production after viral stimulation is independent of replication. 41 It is likely that L-DCs and MDDCs responded to PRRSV with IFN-b transcription prior to virus replication, but the response in MDDCs was sustained due to the additional recognition of replication intermediates, such as doublestranded RNA. However, it is also possible that the variation in IFN-b transcription between cells types is due to inherent differences between MDDCs and L-DCs. It has been shown that MARC-145 cells, a monkey kidney cell line, do not transcribe IFN-b in response to PRRSV, 42 which differs from results presented here.

IFN-b transcription is typically induced after viral stimulation and IFN-b protein is released and signals in an autocrine/paracrine manner for IFN-a transcription, as well as the transcription of other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). 43, 44 The observation that IFN-b mRNA was not translated is supported by the observation that when MDDCs were stimulated with recombinant porcine IFN-a or recombinant human IFN-b1 (data not shown), levels of PKR and Mx mRNA increased. A lack of IFN-b translation has been described in murine alveolar macrophages after TLR activation, in which IFN-b transcription was induced but protein was not synthesized or secreted. 45 This is supported by the observation the L-DCs stimulated with polyIC did increase IFN-b transcription, but neither Mx-1 nor PKR transcription changed. Due to the limited availability of reagents for porcine IFN-b we did not analyse IFN-b protein levels.

            "text": "It is interesting to note that the addition of rpIFN-a to L-DCs at the time of PRRSV inoculation induced the L-DCs to release some type of anti-viral compound. PRRSV did not replicate in L-DCs, indicated by the observation that the quantity of extracellular viable virus or vRNA did not change over time. However, when L-DCs were treated with rpIFN-a, extracellular amounts of viable virus decreased but vRNA levels did not. It is possible that the addition of rpIFN-a to L-DCs induced the expression of an antimicrobial peptide that was able to alter the integrity of live PRRSV because viable virus in the supernatant decreased over time, but the amount of vRNA did not. Antimicrobial peptides, including defensins and cathelicidins, are expressed by various mammalian cells and have been shown to have a role in innate host defence. 46, 47 Antimicrobial peptides are able to insert into membrane bilayers, form pores and consequently compromise micro-organism structure. 48 A recent paper shows that surfactant protein D can bind HIV and inhibit virus replication. 49 Expression of some antimicrobial peptides is constitutive, whereas others are produced in response to proinflammatory cytokines. 50 Overall, IFN-a may induce L-DCs to produce an antimicrobial peptide that is capable of affecting PRRSV viability.",

            "text": "PRRSV infection did not activate the type I interferon response downstream of IFN-b transcription and any anti-viral activity measured in MDDCs was dependent on the addition of rpIFN-a. These data suggest that DCs can respond to IFN-a, but are probably not a major source of the cytokine after PRRSV exposure. L-DCs stimulated with polyIC did increase IFN-b mRNA transcription, but only a minimal change in IFN-a transcription at 12 hr was observed, supporting the observation that L-DCs may not produce substantial quantities of IFN-a but can respond to exogenous IFN-a. In addition, L-DCs stimulated with swine influenza virus (SIV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) did not result in any change in IFN-b, IFN-a, Mx-1 or PKR mRNA transcription at 12 or 24 hr (data not shown). Although it has been shown that circulating myeloid DCs do not produce IFN-a/b protein after stimulation with synthetic double-stranded RNA (polyI:C) or LPS 51 myeloid DCs derived from bone marrow (BM-DC) have been shown to produce IFN-a/b after stimulation with Semliki forest virus. 41 Taken together, these data suggest that there may be inherent differences in the type I interferon responsiveness of tissue-derived versus in vitro-derived myeloid DC subsets after viral exposure. The protective benefits of IFN-a during PRRSV infection was described recently in a study that showed a reduction in PRRSV infection after IFN-a was produced in response to porcine circovirus-2. 52 The amount of IFN-a/b in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid from pigs infected with PRRSV is quite low when compared to levels from pigs infected with SIV or PRCV. 53 SIV and PRCV infect epithelial cells, 54, 55 which may be the source of type I interferon that leads to rapid and effective clearance of virus from the animal. Taken together, these studies indicate that little IFN-a is produced in the lungs of PRRSV infected pigs, although the presence of type I interferon would probably enhance the anti-viral response. Therefore, administration of exogenous IFN-a may be required to effectively trigger the anti-PRRSV immune response and adequately stimulate adaptive immunity for PRRSV clearance.",

PRRSV stimulated IFN-b transcription in both DC types, but was of greater magnitude and duration in MDDCs. Although IFN-b transcription was stimulated, the usual type I interferon response to virus did not occur. PRRSV reduced MHC-I expression on L-DCs and the presence or rpIFN-a could reverse this effect and actually enhance MHC-I and CD80/86 expression. These results indicate that DCs may respond inadequately to PRRSV, leading to a suboptimal initiation of the adaptive immune response. Exogenous type I interferon may be required to induce an effective anti-viral immune response during PRRSV infection. Further studies are warranted to determine the protective benefits of IFN-a during PRRSV infection and its potential as a therapeutic intervention during severe disease outbreaks.",
