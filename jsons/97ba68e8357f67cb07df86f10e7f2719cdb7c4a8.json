A large proportion of positive patients require hospitalization, while 5-6% of them may need more aggressive therapies in intensive care. Most governments have recommended social separation and severe measures of prevention of further spreading of the epidemic. Because hemodialysis (HD) patients need to access hospital and dialysis center facilities 3 times a week, this category of patients requires special attention. In this editorial, we tried to summarize the experience of our centers that hopefully may contribute to help other centers and colleagues that are facing the coming wave of the epidemic. Special algorithms for COVID-19 spreading in the dialysis population, recommendations for isolation and preventive measures in positive HD patients, and finally directions to manage logistics and personnel are reported. These recommendations should be considered neither universal nor absolute. Instead, they require local adjustments based on geographic location, cultural and social environments, and level of available resources.",

It makes perfect sense to recommend to abstain from use of public transport and to use individual transport to and from dialysis facilities. However, not all patients have the capacities to drive themselves. Some rely on relatives, while others (e.g., the majority in most Belgium and Italian units) rely on shared organized transport. We analyzed individual patient's transportation means case-by-case. We motivated all patients to use private transportation as much as possible. For those relying on shared transport, we reduced the number of patients per vehicle. Those with proven infections were excluded from shared transport. Patients tend to arrive in groups, as the dialysis units typically have a number of fixed time slots. We therefore adapted the waiting room. Chairs were put 1.5-2 meters apart, thus extending from the waiting area into the hallways. Patients were asked not to close in on each other. Although center practices may differ, in our units surgical masks are used during connection of the dialysis tubing to the arteriovenous fistula, loop graft, or tunneled central line. Patients were asked not to remove the surgical masks during the dialysis procedure, and to keep their masks for transport to and from the unit. Drivers of organized transport were instructed not to transfer patients, unless masks were worn. Adherence to this was excellent. Further logistics was implemented where possible: patients coming with shared transportation where located in the same area of the dialysis center and treated by the same nurse(s) in order to eventually make possible to trace contacts of patients becoming positive.",

In all patients entering the ward temperature is measured (with 38 \u00b0 C as red flag) and potential symptoms discussed. Patients suspected of having COVID-19 are not allowed to enter the dialysis ward, but are deviated to the emergency department. Third, and this is common Fig. 1 . The UZ Leuven flowchart for patients with suspected infection by SARS-CoV-2. The goal is to detect possible cases early, preferably outside of the dialysis ward, and to isolate proven cases from the other dialysis patients. Suspicion may arise at 3 different moments (in yellow). Ambulatory patients (Left yellow diamond) are stimulated to proactively communicate with the dialysis unit as soon as they have symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (coughing, shortness of breath, fever, unusual abdominal complaints, etc.). We aim to have a diagnostic workup as soon as possible, preferably via the general practitioner, or, if not possible, via a scheduled visit to the emergency room. Second, we triage patients upon arrival at the dialysis unit (middle yellow diamond). Temperature is taken from all patients upon arrival. We use a rule-in strategy (i.e., temperature above 38 \u00b0 C equals suspected case, whereas normal body temperature does not rule out COVID-19). Suspected cases are deviated toward the emergency room. For those patients, we also take an electrolyte panel to see whether dialysis is immedi-ately needed, or that this can be postponed until the results of the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction and computeraided tomography of the chest are known. Finally (right yellow diamond), we scrutinize patients during stay on the dialysis ward. Temperature is taken from all patients multiple times during dialysis. In case we have identified a maintenance dialysis patient as being infected by SARS-CoV-2, we consider the clinical condition (stable enough to be treated as ambulatory patient), home situation (alone, or with vulnerable household contacts?), transportation means (possibility of organized isolated transport). If possible, we opt for continuation of ambulatory care. If not, patients are hospitalized based upon clinical needs on a regular COVID-19 ward, or the intensive care unit.
