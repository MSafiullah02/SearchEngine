Currently, there are no guidelines recommending HPV oral cavity screening as a mandatory test, and it remains unknown which HPV types should be included in HPV screening programs. Our goal was to assess HPV prevalence in oropharyngeal, anal, and cervical swabs using different sets of primers,which are able to amplify \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 HPV types.",

All untyped strains were genetically characterized through PCR amplification and direct sequencing of partial L1 region, and the resulting sequences were classified through phylogenetic analysis. Results: HPV prevalence was 20.9% in 124 oropharyngeal swab samples, including infections with multiple HPV types (5.6%). HPV prevalence in this anatomical site was significantly associated with serostatus: 63.3%in HIV positive and 36.3% in HIV negative patients (p < 0.05). Unclassified types were detected in 6 specimens. In our analysis, we did not observe any difference in HPV (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) prevalence between men and women. Overall, \u03b2 species were the most frequently detected 69.7%. When using anal swabs, for HIV positive patients, \u03b2 genus prevalence was 1% and \u03b3 genus was 3.7% including 6 unclassified types. In cervical samples from 43 HIV positive women (18 HPV negative and 25 positive by MY09/11 PCR), only one sample was positivite for \u03b2 1 species (2.4%) using FAP primers. Six of the untyped strains clustered with sequences from species 7, 9, 10, 8,12 of \u03b3 genus. Four sequences remained unclassified. Finally, \u03b2 and \u03b3 HPV prevalence was significantly lower than their respective HPV prevalence as identified by the Luminex system in all anatomical sites that were analyzed in previous studies.",

Throughout the past years, several studies have suggested the link between HPV infection and other epithelial cancers, including cutaneous and oropharyngeal cancers. Oropharyngeal cancers are often referred to as \"head and neck cancer\" (HNC), and mainly include squamous-cell carcinoma which occurs in the oral cavity, base of tongue, tonsils, adenoids pharynx and larynx. Recent studies on HPV infection in oral exfoliated cells have shown that there is a 13-fold higher risk for oropharyngeal cancer in the presence of virus [3] [4] [5] . The highest prevalence (up to 50%) for these HPV associated cancers has been found in the tonsillar cancers sub-set [6] [7] [8] . Since HPV16 presented a global prevalence in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) of 40.6 and 14.9% respectively [9] , IARC categorized this genotype as a risk factor with for the pathogenesis of both cancers [10] . Additionally, other HPV types have also been linked with these cancers, including HPV18, 31, and 33 [11] including \u03b2 and \u0263 types [4] . Furthermore, while \u03b1-HPV detection seems to be rare in oral cavity in comparison to anal or cervical districts [12] , many novel \u03b2 and \u03b3 types have been isolated in oral cavity [13] suggesting a wide tropism range of these genera [14] . At the same time, different studies on HPV prevalence provided contradicting result for \u03b2 and \u0263 types not only in oropharyngeal site, but also in cervical and anal anatomical sites [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

These primers, both targeting highly conserved region within L1 ORF, are considered broad range PV primers and allow the detection of the great majority of already known and officially recognized HPV types. MY09/11 had been used in \u03b1 HPV detection in cervical sites, where they showed good sensitivity in alpha HPV types amplification [21] , while FAP primers officially recognized HPV from \u03b1-PV, \u03b2-PV, and \u0263-PV genera, and might detect potentially new types [22] [23] [24] [25] .

Nineteen anal swab specimens were identified as HPV positive by FAP primers detection (female anal swabs, n = 3; male anal swabs, n = 16) ( Table 2 ). Overall \u03b1-type strains were detected in 9 samples with FAP primers which were not previously detected by MY09/11 primers. All but one \u03b1-type strains were also detected with \u03b1 mucosal HPV multiple infection typed with CLART HPV2 clinical array which included at least one HR type. HPV \u03b2 2 types (HPV9 and HPV37) were found in two specimens co-infected with \u03b1 HPV types; 2 specimens harboured \u03b3 10 HPV types (HPV121 and HPV180), both associated with type \u03b1 HPV multiple infections. All FAP untyped strains (n = 6) were found in anal specimens infected by \u03b1 types with at least one high HR type. Considering cytological aspects, 12/19 samples, which resulted positive with FAP primer PCR, had AIN (I, II) lesions, while 7/19 samples showed normal cytology (Table 2) .",

            "text": "In HNC, particularly oropharyngeal cancer, the true prevalence and involvement of HPV in the carcinogenetic process is still unknown. In fact, many studies report low prevalence of HPV obtained with systems used for the determination of HPV in cervical cancer screening (specific for \u03b1 types), while other authors found higher prevalence when they used a platform able to detect HPV types belonging to genera other than \u03b1 genus [4] both in oral cavity and in oral cancer [4, 39] . Agalliu recently found a correlation between the infection of some \u03b2, \u0263 HPV types and OSCC [4] . Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis provided additional evidence of the involvement of \u03b2 HPV types in the development of SCC in immunocompetent individuals [40] . Additionally, several mechanistic studies have consistently showed that E6 and E7 from several \u03b2 HPV types are able to target cellular proteins, such as p53 and pRb, and to deregulate fundamental events involved in cellular transformation [41] . Thus \u03b2 and \u0263 HPV types detection could be included in a HPV screening test for oral cancer prevention, while a correct and suitable detection of HPV infection is becoming a priority. Currently, there are few studies that compare the HPV prevalence obtained using the protocols, which are normally for cervical cancer screening with those obtained using methods that are able to detect HPV types belonging to genera other than \u03b1 or new ones. In this study, in order to assess the impact of PCR system in HPV prevalence determination, we carried out the detection of HPV with MY09/11 primer set, used in several genotyping molecular assays (for example Linear Array HPV genotyping Test, Roche Molecular system, CA USA; CLART HPV2 clinical arrays, Genomica, Madrid, Spain,) and FAP primers able to detect \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 HPV types in several specimens. In oropharyngeal swabs samples, MY09/ 11 primer set was able to detect 39.4% (13/33) of HPV positive samples, while FAP set of primers detected the presence of HPV in 20/33 samples (60.6%). Beta HPV was the main genus detected with a prevalence of 69.7% in HPV positive samples. This prevalence was in agreement with Bottalico et al. that used FAP primer and MY09/11 for detecting HPV in oral swabs [14] . HPV5 was the most frequent \u03b2 1 type and HPV145 the main type among \u03b2 2 species as described by Bottalico [14] . HPV38, which was reported as the main \u03b2 2 type in Forslund study [42] , was absent in our samples. HR, namely HPV16, was observed only in one specimen from an HIV positive subject, whereas HR HPV were frequently observed in Bottalico study group [14] . The low frequency of HR could be imputed to immune status of the patients. Our patients were under HAART therapy and most of them had a CD4 T cell count > 200 /\u03bcl. No severe compromise of the immune-system could have limited a persistence of HR in this anatomical site. Unfortunately, no information was given in the Bottalico paper on patient CD4 T cell count, and this fact did not allow a correct comparison of these results. According to previous data reported by Forslund et al. [42] , no difference in HPV prevalence was observed among men and women suggesting that host specific factors could contribute to HPV persistence and neoplasia development. Gamma genus represented 21.8% of HPV positive samples. To note, 6/7 \u03b3 strains were untyped. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2 samples (Q1766 and Q1644) belonged to \u03b3 7 species, while Q656 to \u03b3 12 species and Q337 to \u03b3 9 species. Interestingly, the oral untyped genotypes fell in different genera and cluster with the anal untyped strains, suggesting a specific tropism of these gamma types for oral mucosa. Gamma 12 and 7 were the most representative \u03b3 species described by Bottalico in oral rinse and Agalliu in HNC, suggesting their potential involvement in OSCC development. Unlike Forslund and Hampras [42, 43] , we did not identified any \u03b2 3, \u03b2 4, \u03b2 5 HPV types. This may be due to the types of biological samples that were used or to differences in the efficiency of extraction methods that were applied, which could have influenced the outcome of PCR [44] . Finally, differences in results might also be explained by the geographical distribution of HPV types. In general, differences in HPV \u03b2 and \u03b3 types and their prevalence were observed by the Luminex platform. According to HIM study [43] , among \u03b2 1 genotypes, HPV12 and HPV5 were the prevalent genotypes. While, among \u03b2 2 strains, HPV38 was the most represented,and it was never detected in our samples. Interestingly HR HPV38 was also the main \u03b2 2 type observed also in Moscicki study, whereas HPV21 represented the main \u03b2 1 type [45] . A different pattern of \u03b2 types could be related to a different cellular input as described in a previous study [46] , where several \u03b2 HPV types showed essentially increasing prevalence with increasing DNA input. Beta HPV types 8, 14, 20, 21, 23, 38 , and 92 showed increased prevalence only in higher DNA input groups [46] . This may impose compromises in comparisons between studies; for example, our HPV38 negative result could be explained by an insufficient DNA input in the PCR assay. Further research is needed to establish whether there is an influence between cell number input and HPV \u03b2 detection in oropharyngeal anatomical site and which cut-off would be suggested to avoid false negative results. Possible type-specific differences in sensitivity to cellular input have to be evaluated in wider studies. If they are confirmed, they may be explained by the different sensitivities in detection systems and/or in the Fig. 1 A maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was inferred on 10 unknown collected samples (bold) and 59 reference sequences using the GTRCAT model. Out of 10 unknown samples, 6 sequences were clustered within previously classified HPV species lineages. Bootstrap supports lower than 70% were excluded from the tree. GenBank accession number: MH647655-MH647663 different viral load spectra. We detected 9 \u03b1 strains in anal site FAP primers that had not been typed by Genomica, and 2 \u03b2 2 types, HPV9 and HPV37, that had not been reported among oropharyngeal swabs. \u0392eta types frequency was sensibly lower to that found by Luminex system reported by Torres et al. [17] which found 65.6% of \u03b2 types in anal swabs from HIV positive MSM and 59.1% among HIV negative MSM. In this study, HPV12 and HPV 107 were the prevalent types among \u03b2 1 species, while HPV38 and HPV120 were the most frequently observed \u03b2 2 types. Among \u03b3 genus, the \u03b3 10 species was the most prevalent in both MSM HIV positive and -negative groups, while we observed only \u03b3 untyped strains. Don\u00e0 reported higher prevalence of \u03b2 (27.6%) and \u03b3 types (29.3%) in a group of MSM similar to ours using the Luminex system [16] . Some hypothesis could put forth to explain these data: i) The Luminex system could be much more sensitive than the FAP system, or ii) that cross-reactivity could occur in \u03b2 and \u03b3 types detection when \u03b1 multiple infections are present. In literature, cross-reactivity was also observed among \u03b1 genotypes. Preisler observed cross-reactivity both in LR and HR genotypes using HC2, COBAS, and APTIMA assays, despite what manufacturer claims: about 25% of HPVDNA results in primary screening accounting for cross-reactivity, regardless of the assay [47] . To obtain improved analytical and clinical performance, cross-reactivity studies should be focused, since this aspect could influence the effectiveness in a future head neck HPV cancer screening.",

This low prevalence of \u03b2 types confirms the data reported by Bottalico et al. [14] , which found a prevalence of 1% of the \u03b2 types and 3% of the \u03b3 types in the cervical samples, emphasizing a weak \u03b2 and \u03b3 type tropism towards the female genital mucosa. However, the genotypes HPV93 and HPV124, detected by Bottalico in cervical specimens, were never observed among our cervical samples, suggesting a different geographic distribution of HPV \u03b2 and \u03b3 type similarly to that described for \u03b1 genus. Conversely, these findings were in disagreement with those obtained by Luminex system, as described in previous study [18] .",

The genus \u03b2 and \u03b3 were predominant when the analysis was carried out with FAP primers. The discrepancy on the prevalence and HPV types reported in other studies [16] [17] [18] 49] seems to be due to the detection system: highest prevalence was always obtained with the Luminex system. Different sensitivity and specificity of HPV detection methods were also a problem in the determination of \u03b1 HPV types, as described in a systematic review where approximately 30-60% of all positive results showed discordance [50] . A global proficiency program like LabNet for \u03b1 types in cervical HPV infection surveillance programs should be planned also for \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 HPV type detection in oropharyngeal samples [51] . Standardizing methods for oral sample collection and HPV detection would ensure comparability between different detection methods in oral cavity samples [52, 53] .",
