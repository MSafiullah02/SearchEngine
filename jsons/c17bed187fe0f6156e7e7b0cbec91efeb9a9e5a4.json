Tropical climate is characterized by high ambient temperature; some tropical regions receive heavy rains, while others get little precipitation. The rainy tropical ecosystem promotes the survival of pathogenic microorganisms outside the human host and is suitable for proliferation of parasites and vermin that cause disease or act as reservoirs, intermediate hosts, and vectors. On the other hand, water scarcity in the arid regions increases the susceptibility of kidneys to relatively minor insults. The tropics are home to a number of poisonous snakes and arthropods. Flooding of burrows in the rainy season forces snakes to come to the surface at a time when large numbers of workers are in the fields for planting or harvesting crops, leading to a spike in the incidence of bite victims. Seasonal variation in the incidence of AKI due to tropical infections and snake envenomation is a common feature throughout the tropics. Quality of drinking water plays a major role in the pattern of kidney disease in the tropics. A number of conditions that are associated with of AKI in the tropics (see below) can be causally linked to contaminated water. The leaching of minerals and organic compounds into the fragile tropical soil during rains leads to waterlogging and contamination of fields [2] and also promote waterborne diseases. Transmission by direct contact and aerosols is also more likely because of overcrowding and poor living conditions in the tropics.",

Almost all of the tropical countries are classified by the World Bank into low or low-middle income categories. The healthcare systems in the poor tropical countries exhibit several limitations in the form of limited and unevenly distributed medical resources, lack of specialized care, high costs, fear and suspicion of modern medicine, and continued reliance on traditional health systems. The harmful consequences are both secondary to denial or delay of appropriate treatment, and the use of potentially toxic ingredients of indigenous remedies is toxic that can lead to AKI.",

The available reports are single-center studies conducted at academic institutions, which may not be truly representative of the true characteristics of AKI, especially in rural settings. Patients are referred in advanced stages of illness, often with complications, and those developing AKI in rural communities may not reach hospitals at all. Most of the available studies have used different denominators to calculate the incidence of AKI or described single entities like \"obstetric AKI\" or \"AKI due to leptospirosis.\" The absence of uniform definitions and use of inconsistent terminology has added another layer of complexity. All this makes estimation of disease burden and accurate comparisons difficult. AKI is recognized as the most common renal emergency in tropical countries. However, the reported incidence has been variable and in general lower compared to other regions. In 2013, the International Society of Nephrology started the 0by25 (zero preventable deaths due to AKI by 2025) initiative, with focus on LMIC. A metaanalysis done as a part of this initiative included a large number of studies that have not been published in mainstream journals and provided the most comprehensive documentation yet of the incidence of AKI in different parts of the world (Table 14. 1) [5] .",

In fact, in regions from where reports are gradually becoming available, the burden of AKI in hospitalized patients seems to be equivalent. Also, patients with more severe stages of AKI had high mortality, similar to other reports (42% and 46%, unadjusted odds ratio 12.5 and 19.7, respectively) [5] . The report confirmed the higher incidence of CAAKI in the developing countries, delayed presentation, and greater likelihood of not receiving RRT despite being indicated due to lack of resources and being discharged from the hospital to home, rather than to a step-down facility. The International Society of Nephrology 0by25 Global Snapshot [6] provided a unique, though limited, picture of AKI around the globe. The snapshot provided significant insights into differences in epidemiology of AKI between countries in different socioeconomic categories and reaffirmed previous concepts about epidemiology of AKI in the low-income tropical countries. The distinguishing features of patients with AKI in LIC and LMIC were young age, low prevalence of preexisting CKD, presentation with more severe stages of AKI and relative prevalence of AKI associated with sepsis, obstetric complications, and animal envenomation. Lack of resources and inability to afford therapy meant that a significant proportion of patients could not receive dialysis despite being indicated. Although the overall mortality was higher, the survivors were more likely to show complete recovery from AKI in LLMIC.",

The characteristics of HAAKI encountered in ICUs of large urban tropical centers are largely similar to the highincome countries, with relatively accessible sophisticated healthcare systems, even though these ICUs may also have patients with AKI secondary to tropical diseases. In rural areas, CAAKI secondary to diarrheal disease, envenomation from snakebite, leptospirosis, malaria, or obstetric complications predominate [6] .

Early antivenom administration prevents or attenuates the development of hematological abnormalities or rhabdomyolysis and AKI. There is no consensus on the dose of antivenom or the duration of therapy. One approach in the case of hemotoxic bites has been to titrate the dose according to the whole-blood clotting time. Some recent studies, however, have shown that the outcomes are similar even with the use of a fixed lower dose of antivenom. Supportive measures include judicious volume replacement, inoculation with antitetanus immunoglobulin, and appropriate management of bleeding risk by the use of fresh frozen plasma as needed. Patients bitten by myotoxic snakes need aggressive fluid therapy and urinary alkalinization to prevent intratubular precipitation of myoglobin. Mortality from snakebite envenomation is estimated to be up to 35%. A substantial proportion, especially those with patchy or diffuse cortical necrosis and thrombotic microangiopathy, is left with varying degrees of renal insufficiency.",

AKI typically results in individuals who sustain multiple stings from a swarm of insects like honey bees or wasps, resulting in injection of a large dose of toxins. Kidney injury is usually secondary to hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis, though direct toxicity has also been proposed. Less commonly, AKI has been described following isolated stings secondary to anaphylactic reactions or thrombotic microangiopathy [12] . Apart from AKI, proteinuria and nephritic and nephrotic syndromes have also been reported after insect stings [13] [14] [15] . The diagnosis is usually obvious. Management is largely supportive and symptomatic, including short course of steroids, antihistamines, fluid replacement, and RRT if necessary.",

            "text": "AKI related to complications of pregnancy (obstetric AKI) has been all but eliminated from developed nontropical economies due to system- wide improvements in healthcare delivery. In contrast, obstetric AKI continues to be encountered in many tropical countries due to suboptimal antenatal care, frequent out-of-hospital childbirth, and unsafe abortion practices. Obstetric AKI shows a bimodal temporal distribution: the first peak, attributable to hyperemesis gravidarum and septic abortion, is seen in the first trimester. Preeclampsia, eclampsia, placental abruption, postpartum hemorrhage, and puerperal sepsis develop close to term or following delivery and account for the second peak of AKI in third trimester or in the immediate postpartum period. There is a significant variation, however, in the frequency and outcome of obstetric AKI in different parts of tropics. In India, the contribution of obstetric AKI declined from 22% of all cases of AKI in the 1970s to approximately 8% in the 1990s. This decline was attributed to legalization of abortion and improvements in antenatal care [16] . In other parts of the tropics, however, obstetric AKI continues to be prevalent and has a poor prognosis even today. Septic abortion is the cause of AKI in 52% of patients in Ethiopia [17] , and in Argentina and Nigeria, gynecological and obstetric complications still account for about one third of patients with AKI [18] [19] [20] . In one hospital in Pakistan, of 100 patients with obstetric AKI seen over a 3 year period, over 90% needed dialysis, 7% died in hospital, and only 44% were off dialysis at discharge [21] . About 20% of all patients develop acute cortical necrosis, the most catastrophic variety of AKI. In recent years, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, secondary to genetic abnormalities in complement regulatory proteins, has been recognized in several cases of third trimester and postpartum AKI (Ramachandran R, unpublished). It is important to identify these cases because they respond well to eculizumab.",

A variety of renal lesions including acute tubular necrosis, acute cortical necrosis, and interstitial nephritis have been reported [22] . Even some of the commonly ingested tropical plant foods can have toxic effects if consumed without proper preparation ( Fig. 14.2 ). An example is the consumption of beans from the djenkol plant, a delicacy in several Southeast Asian countries [23] . Ingestion of a large amount of uncooked beans, especially in individuals with a low fluid intake, can cause oliguric AKI secondary to the intratubular precipitation of djenkolic acid crystals. The breath and urine of these patients have a characteristic, sulfurous odor, and the needlelike crystals can be seen in urine under light microscopy. Increased fluid intake and urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate help to dissolve the crystals. About 25-60% of all cases of AKI from medical causes in hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa are associated with the use of traditional herbal medicines. Such medicines are usually prepared under nonstandard conditions and are not tested for efficacy and safety, the ingredients are variable, and dosage and route of administration are often not standardized.",

During the 1980s, 35-50% of all children who required dialysis for AKI in India had diarrhea-related AKI [36, 37] . The current incidence of diarrhearelated AKI requiring dialysis has declined to 8% as a result of the improved sanitation and widespread use of oral rehydration solutions [8] .",

Though classically associated with streptococcal infection, PIGN can follow any bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infection. Manifestation can be with asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, acute nephritic illness, hypertension, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (more common in adults). While the incidence of PIGN has declined in the high-income countries, it continues to be a common condition in the tropical LMIC, where the burden of infection due to nephritogenic bacteria continues to be high. The burden of group A streptococcal infections was estimated to be 24.3 cases per 100,000 personyears in adults and 2 cases per 100,000 personyears in children in the developing countries [47] , compared to 6 and 0.3 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively, in developed regions. PIGN is primarily seen among children and young adults in developing countries with a male preponderance of 2-3:1, while the patients in the developed world tend to be adults [48] . In a study from India, PIGN was identified as the cause in 86.7% of children who presented with nephritic illness [49] and PIGN accounted for 16.9% of AKI [50] .",

Vector control using an integrated vector management strategy is the most effective way to prevent transmission of vector-borne diseases. This is based on employing a range of interventions, such as rational use of pesticides and mosquito nets on the basis of local knowledge about vectors, disease determinants, and engagement with local communities and other stakeholders within a public health regulatory and legislative framework. Improving public awareness of the need for use of safe water, safe handling and use of pesticides and other nephrotoxins should be attempted by sustained campaigns in mass media.",

Availability of point-of-care tests will be helpful in this process. The few tests in development include those that measure salivary urea nitrogen or work on an algorithm based on urine color. Early institution of rehydration therapy may limit the sever-ity of AKI.
