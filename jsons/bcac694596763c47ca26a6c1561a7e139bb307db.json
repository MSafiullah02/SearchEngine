Since 1997, students have developed and proposed their own research questions and derived their research projects from them as the keystone of the program. Because MTBI's mentors have no control over what students are interested in, we need to introduce a suite of flexible techniques that can be applied to a broad variety of interests. In this paper, we walk through examples of some of the most popular techniques at MTBI: epidemiological or contagion modeling and reproductive number analysis. We include an overview of the next generation matrix method of finding the basic reproductive number, sensitivity analysis as a technique for investigating the effect of parameters on the reproductive number, and recommendations for interpreting the results. Lastly, we provide some advice to mentors who are looking to advise student-led research projects. All examples are taken from actual student projects that are generally available through the MTBI website. Suggested Prerequisites Ordinary differential equations, mass action, SIR model, flow diagrams, equilibria, stability, Jacobian matrix, and eigenvalue.",

            "text": "The MTBI summer program runs for 8 weeks. In the first 3 weeks, students attend lectures in theoretical ecology and various epidemiological-contact-contagion modeling techniques, as used in broadly understood dynamical systems: nonlinear systems of difference and differential equations, discrete and continuous time Markov chains, partial differential equations and agent based modeling. In the final 5 weeks of the program, students form self-selected groups of three to five undergraduates, and investigate a problem of their own choosing. They research the background of the problem, identify a question, construct a model to address the question, analyze the results, and write a technical report describing their project. While the faculty mentors' experience is primarily in mathematical biology, students' interests can be quite diverse [21] . Past projects have included such diverse topics as epidemiology [1, 4, 5, 12, 27, 38, 39, 47, 48] , eating disorders [40, 41] , party politics [13, 57] , prison education [2, 49] , immigration [25] , the menstrual cycle [37] , education [29, 30, 32, 42] , and ecology [28, 45, 55, 56] . Because of the broad variety of student selected topics, students frequently know a lot more about the modeling application than the mentors do. Students take the lead on the project and provide subject matter knowledge, while mentors provide general expertise in mathematical modeling techniques that can be applied to a broad variety of topics.",

When R 0 > 1, values close to the disease-free equilibrium tend away from the diseasefree equilibrium making it impossible for a disease to completely die out as long as there is sufficient supply of susceptibles.

While most students at MTBI take on ecology or biology projects, these students were particularly interested in problems related to the quality of education in the USA. They worried about students feeling discouraged by working in stressful school conditions with little teacher support. As budget cuts started to affect class sizes, they were concerned that problems with student attitudes and dropping out would increase. So they designed a model to investigate the problem of how student-teacher ratio in classes affects class sizes. In this model, Diaz, Feet, Torres-Garcia, and Crisosto modeled a discouraged attitude as something that both students and teachers could have. By social interaction, teachers and students could both pass on (metaphorically infect others with) this negative attitude.",

Our interpretation of R 0 is based on the idea of a single discouraged teacher and a single discouraged student. But D 1 = D 2 = 1 is not the case of a single teacher and a single student. Instead these are the cases of the entire populations being discouraged. So there are two problems with this. The first problem is that D 1 = D 2 = 1 represent different numbers of teachers and students, because the total populations are different. The second problem is that in order for us to interpret R 0 , we need the population to be mostly uninfected, which means that D 1 and D 2 need to be small. So we need an interpretation that is meaningful for D 1 and D 2 as proportions, with D 1 = D 2 1. So an overall better interpretation of this basic reproductive number is that it measures the combined percentage of discouraged teachers and percentage of discouraged students produced by a small percentage of discouraged teachers and equivalent small percentage of discouraged students throughout the duration of time that those small percentages are discouraged. For example, if R 0 is 2, then we could interpret this as saying that when the percentage of discouraged people is small, the percentage of the next generation of discouraged people will be approximately twice as big.",

Some researchers define X as the infected class, and Y as the uninfected class, so that X = F \u2212 V . Some researchers do not define their uninfected X and infected Y classes explicitly, and you have to identify how they separated their classes from the F and V expressions. Other researchers will define F and V for all the classes in the model (in the student-teacher model F and V would be 4 \u00d7 4 instead of 2 \u00d7 2) but still only calculate the Jacobian for the infected classes, so the resulting F and V are still the same (2 \u00d7 2) matrices as above.

Herpes (HSV-2) is a disease that \"hides\" in the nervous system of the host, and only periodically emerges to cause symptoms on the skin. Current treatments can force the disease into the asymptomatic stage, but cannot eliminate the disease from the body entirely, so it always returns. When the disease emerges, initial symptoms resemble a lot of other diseases, while later symptoms are distinctive. Current protocols only administer treatment when the disease has progressed to the later stage, and the patient has already been infections for some time. The question the Luis Almonte-Vega, Monica Col\u00f3n-Vargas, Ligia Luna-Jarr\u0144, Joel Martinez, and Jordy Rodriguez-Rinc\u00f3n, wanted to study was the cost effectiveness of treating during the early stages when the disease is less infectious, but money would be wasted on treating false positives.

Using the growth of the Green Party as a source of data, the researchers wanted to study the growth of grassroots political movements, and explore voter recruitment strategies. The third party model had a relatively simple structure, where the researchers considered three levels of engagement. A population S of people who were susceptible to the messages of the political party, a population V of people who voted for the third party, and a population M of active members of the party. Both voters and members could convince susceptible to become voters, although members were more effective than voters. Also members could recruit voters to become members.

We will use the malaria model for this example. Kamal Barley, Sharquetta Tatum, and David Murillo were inspired by the high prevalence of both HIV and malaria in the Republic of Malawi. Both diseases increase the impact on the other. HIV weakens the immune system, which makes it easier for malaria to infect people, and malaria increases the viral load of HIV.

In this section, we will discuss other forms that R 0 can take that commonly appear in student projects, and how to interpret those structures. In order to keep these sections short, we will primarily be using flow diagrams to discuss the models. As always we strongly encourage you read the original papers for more details on the models and analysis. Furthermore, every paper cited in this section also used a next generation approach to finding the basic reproductive number, so these are all good sources if you want additional examples of that approach.",

Julijana Gjorgjieva, Kelly Smith, and Jessica Snyder were inspired by the prominent news coverage of the 2002 SARS epidemic. In particular, they were interested in the control plan for SARS. Because the disease was new and there was no treatment, control focused on isolating people who showed symptoms, and tracing their contacts to identify other people who might have the disease. Since no treatment had been developed, the researchers saw an opportunity to compare the current tracingand-isolation control plan to a possible future vaccination strategy.",

TB is often carried latently, and HIV [27] increases the chance of TB developing symptoms. So the researchers wanted to construct a model that would suggest strategies to control both epidemics. Tuberculosis has a latent stage, during which a person is infected but uninfectious. HIV has an asymptomatic infectious stage, and the symptomatic stage, when the infected person has developed AIDS. In order to track the behavior of a population, the researchers needed to develop a model that captures every possible combination of stages, as seen in Fig. 2 . Note that the infection terms need to be summed over a large number of compartments, because a large number of different compartments all carry the same disease. For example, H , H L , H I , and A all carry HIV and can infect a susceptible with HIV, so the HIV infection rate must include all of these compartments.",

A key feature of herpes discussed in Sect. 3.1 is that a single infection goes through multiple cycles of infectiousness. This leads to a potentially infinite number of paths to I: S \u2192 I , S \u2192 I \u2192 L \u2192 I , S \u2192 I \u2192 L \u2192 I \u2192 L \u2192 I , etc. Each of these paths is still a single infection, so each path needs to be considered in the basic reproductive number. In order to study this phenomenon, the researchers started with a simplified model before moving on to their full model. The simplified model only has compartments for S susceptible, I infected, and L latent (Fig. 4) . The basic reproductive number for this simplified model was: Fig. 4 Flow diagram for the simplified herpes model: S susceptible, I infectious, and L latent [1] In this basic reproductive number, \u03b2 is the infection rate, divided by \u03bc + \u03b3 is the time in I , so this forms our standard basic reproductive number. Our previous examples have suggested that the remaining factor should be a proportion. \u03b3 \u03bc+\u03b3 is the proportion of people who leave I to enter L, and r \u03bc+r is the proportion of people who leave L to return to I . So the product p = \u03b3 \u03bc+\u03b3 \u00b7 r \u03bc+r is the proportion of people in I who make a single round trip back to I (I \u2192 L \u2192 I ).",

In order for a male to infect another male, the disease must first infect a female, and vice-versa. So the number of new infected males produced by a single infected male is the number of infected females produced by that infected male, times the number of infected males produced by each new infected female. For example, if a male infects 8 females, and each female infects 2 males, then the number of newly infected males produced by that original male would be 8 \u00b7 2 = 16. But this is a two-step process. In order to scale the process back to a single infection step, we need to average the two values. Because the process is multiplicative, we average with a geometric mean instead of an arithmetic mean. Note that \u221a 8 \u00b7 2 = 4 and 4 \u00b7 4 = 16, while an arithmetic mean does not quite work: 8+2 2 = 5 and 5 \u00b7 5 = 25.

The 1918 pandemic was devastating and it has been linked to at least 50 million deaths. Vaccines, typically effective against seasonal influenza, are in general ineffective against novel strains, the most likely of drivers of pandemic influenza. As an outbreak sweeps a region, it alters the average immunological profile of a population. By how much? Well it depends on levels of protection, cross-immunity, that may protect against future strains. Some relevant references include [8, 10, 52] .",
