The alpaca was euthanized by administration of a barbiturate overdose and a postmortem examination performed. At necropsy, gross findings included emaciation, fluid intestinal contents, and markedly enlarged ileocecal lymph nodes. The uterus contained a 34-cm crown-torump length female fetus. No macroscopic lesions were observed in the bone marrow or intestine. An impression smear of an ileocecal lymph node disclosed acid-fast bacilli among numerous lymphocytes and macrophages (Fig 1) . On histology, most of the bone marrow consisted of mature adipocytes, with occasional small foci of cellularity where all cell lines were represented. The ileocecal lymph nodes were expanded by infiltrating sheets of epithelioid macrophages, scattered multinucleate cells, and low to moderate numbers of eosinophils. The mucosa of the distal jejunum and ileum was markedly expanded by sheets of infiltrating macrophages (Fig 2) . The villi were atrophied, and nodular infiltrates of macrophages surrounded the lymphatics. Sheets of macrophages also infiltrated the submucosal lymphoid tissue of the large intestine. A postmortem a diagnosis of severe chronic granulomatous enterocolitis and granulomatous lymphadenitis consistent with paratuberculosis was made. Samples of ileum, ileocecal junction, ileocecal lymph node, and feces were collected for mycobacterial culture with liquid media, and standard Herrold's Egg Yolk Medium (HEYM) according to methods described previously. [1] [2] [3] In order to facilitate quantification of MAP growth, 4 serial 10-fold dilutions (1 : 10; 1 : 100, 1 : 1,000, and 1 : 10,000) were prepared from each original tissue and fecal samples. For each sample type, 100 mL of the original inoculum, and of each inoculum dilution, was added to 1 mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT) e culture tube. Also, for each sample type, 100 mL of the original inoculum, and all but 2 dilutions (1 : 10 and 1 : 10,000), were added to 3 HEYM flasks. For liquid culture, time to positive was recorded in days for each inoculum, and the growth was confirmed as MAP by RT-PCR. For solid media culture, the total number of MAP colony forming units (CFU)/g of tissue or feces was estimated based on the sample weight, dilution fac-tor, and the average number of colonies counted per flask.",

Clinical signs of paratuberculosis in camelids are similar to those reported in cattle and small ruminant species and may include lethargy, chronic weight loss, and dependent edema. In contrast to cattle, but similar to small ruminants, not all camelids in advanced stage of disease will develop diarrhea or changes in fecal consistency. Case 1 had diarrhea for at least 3 months before presentation, but cases 2 and 3 did not. Two llamas from a previous report showed signs of weight loss associated with diarrhea. 6 Another report on 10 alpacas described 5 animals that experienced diarrhea before death. 7 The difference in the occurrence of diarrhea between cattle and camelids (and small ruminants) may be related to the latter's intestinal tract physiology and their ability to reabsorb water. Also in contrast with cattle, camelids and small ruminants affected with paratuberculosis can present with anemia of variable severity. The pathophysiology for the development of anemia in camelids and small ruminants with JD is unclear, but could be secondary to the chronicity of the disorder, especially when the anemia is classified as normocytic and normochromic. 8 In addition, concurrent disease processes such as internal parasitism or infection with Mycoplasma haemolamae may contribute to the degree of anemia. The reported age at onset of clinical signs tends to be younger in camelids than in cattle. Three of the 10 alpacas reported before were between 11 and 14 months of age, 6 and 1 of the 2 llamas in the other report was 16 months old. 7 A possible explanation for this finding is that the incubation period for certain MAP strains is shorter in camelids than in other species, but this has not been proven.",

To the farm owner's knowledge, this was the 1st case of JD in the herd since it was established several years ago. For both cases 2 and 3, the lack of histologic findings consistent with paratuberculosis in the presence of positive tissue cultures was suggestive of early infection with MAP. The absence of histologic lesions in the face of positive tissue culture has been documented in short-term bovine experimental challenges with MAP. 9 Furthermore, we hypothesized that case 1, which was shedding very high numbers of MAP in the feces, could have been the source of infection within the herd. However, genotyping of the MAP strains isolated from all 3 alpacas described here suggests that 41 strain of MAP was present in the herd and that case 1 was not solely responsible for the presence of additional positive animals within the herd. The MAP strain identified in cases 1 and 2 was reported as a cattle strain, whereas the 2 different MAP strains isolated from case 3 were identified as a sheep strains. Isolation of bovinetype strains in camelids affected by JD has been reported before, 6, 7 and most strains probably can infect across ruminant species lines. 10 The practice of feeding bovine colostrum to neonatal crias is believed to be a possible source of MAP introduction within a herd. Cases 2 and 3 would have been 7 and 11 years old, respectively, when case 1 joined the herd. Traditionally, adult animals have been considered fairly resistant to infection with MAP, because the critical period for acquiring infection is during the neonatal period. 11 Age resistance could have been overcome by the pressure of infection if the environment was highly contaminated by a high-shedding animal (case 1).",

            "text": "Previous reports of JD in camelids have not included quantitative culture results for MAP on either tissues or feces. In this report, the number of MAP CFU/g was obtained from tissue samples (cases 2 and 3) or from both tissue and fecal samples (case 1). Although cases 2 and 3 had small to moderate numbers of CFU in their tissues, case 1 had extremely high numbers of MAP CFU/g of tissue and feces. Similar numbers (410,000 MAP CFU/g) have been reported in cattle. 12 These cows, shedding extremely large numbers of MAP in their feces, recently have been referred to as ''super-shedders.'' 12 According to an arbitrary definition (4 10,000 MAP CFU/ g feces), case 1 would fall into this category. In cattle, the presence of 1 or more high shedding cows in a herd has been considered as an important factor in the transmission and control of the disease. 12 Because high-shedding animals can shed millions of MAP CFU daily, they represent a greater risk for the spread of the disease to herd mates. In addition, as demonstrated in this report, the presence of 1 or several animals shedding large numbers of MAP in their feces may contribute to ''passive shedding'' of MAP by herd mates. As MAP is deposited on pasture by the infected animals, it may be ingested by other animals and detected in their feces by RT-PCR. Follow-up fecal RT-PCR testing performed on the farm described here showed a decrease in the number of animals classified as positive after removal of case 1 from the herd, suggesting that these animals were passive shedders, and passive shedding ceased once the high-shedding animal was removed.",
