            "text": "The therapeutic options for patients with advanced pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disorders are limited. Lung transplantation remains one of the few viable interventions, but on account of the insuffi cient donor pool only a minority of these patients actually undergo the procedure each year. Further, the projections for the number of lung transplant candidates will continue to increase with our expanding older patient demographic. Despite the increase in transplant procedures annually, the problem of organ availability and suitability will likely persist. A number of solutions for expanding the donor pool have been implemented or are under active experimental or clinical investigation, including changes in the allocation methods, interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and ex vivo lung perfusion and utilizing older donor organs and organs procured following circulatory cessation or donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD). Following transplantation there are a number of early and late allograft complications such as primary graft dysfunction, allograft rejection, infec-tion, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and late injury that is now classifi ed as chronic lung allograft dysfunction. The pathologist plays an essential role in the diagnosis and classifi cation of these myriad complications. Although the transplant procedures are performed in selected centers patients typically return home after a period of convalescence and observation. When complications arise thereafter it is often the responsibility of the local pathologist to evaluate the laboratory, cytopathologic and histopathologic studies. For these reasons familiarity with the pathology of lung transplantation is important.",

            "text": "The initial experimental attempts at lung transplantation date back over a century ago when Guthrie and Carrel implanted the heart and lungs of a kitten into the neck vessels of an adult cat [ 1 ] . Forty years later, the Russian physiologist Demikhov developed canine models of combined heart-lung and single transplantation [ 2 , 3 ] . In the early 1960s, Hardy and colleagues at the University of Mississippi performed the fi rst human lung transplant in 1963 in a 58-year old man with advanced lung cancer. He survived 18 days, but succumbed to renal failure ; no acute cellular rejection ( ACR ) was found at postmortem examination [ 4 ] . The fi rst Canadian lung transplant was performed in 1966. The recipient was a 31-year old man with advanced silicosis and he survived only 7 days. At postmortem, the transplanted lung showed ACR , preservation injury, and necrosis of the proximal bronchus [ 5 ] . In 1968, Cooley attempted the fi rst human combined heart-lung transplant on a 2-month old child with complex congenital heart disease, but she died 14 h later from respiratory failure [ 6 ] . Shortly thereafter, Lillehi and colleagues performed the procedure in an adult recipient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) and cor pulmonale with survival of only 8 days. Attempts at lung transplantation sputtered over the next decade with many centers abandoning their programs on account of dismal survival results attributable to insuffi cient immunosuppression and/or technical diffi culties such as anastomotic dehiscence [ 7 ] . With the initiation of the cyclosporine era in 1980, there was resurgence in interest in combined heart-lung transplantation by the Stanford team and lung transplantation in the Toronto program. This novel form of immunosuppression permitted reduced corticosteroid dosages and led to a reduction in anastomotic complications. Reitz et al. at Stanford [ 8 ] overcame a series of technical and immunosuppressive liabilities utilizing a nonhuman primate model before achieving successful long-term survival in their clinical program. Four of the fi ve patients transplanted for advanced pulmonary vascular disease (either idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( IPAH ) or complex congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger's physiology) survived beyond a 6-month period of follow-up.",

In adults, the main indications are COPD including emphysema and alpha-1-antitrypsin defi ciency, suppurative lung disease/cystic fi brosis ( CF ), fi brotic interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) including idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and nonspecifi c interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and pulmonary vascular disease including IPAH and Eisenmenger's physiology ( Fig. 1 ) In the most recent published data from the ISHLT registry , there has been a sevenfold increase in the number of lung transplants since 1990, with 33,893 lung transplants reported in 2013 and a total of 51,440 lung and 3820 heartlung procedures recorded up to mid-2014 [ 15 ] . The median survival is 5.6 years with bilateral/ double lung recipients having much better median survival rates compared to single lung transplant patients (7.1 versus 4.5 years). Over the last 15 years, there has been a shift from single lung to bilateral/double lung transplant as the preferred surgical procedure. One hundred and twenty four pediatric lung transplant procedures were performed in 2013. In infants and children , there are unique pediatric conditions that require transplantation in addition to the suppurative and pulmonary vascular categories. In infants under the age of 1 year, the most common indications are IPAH or other vascular disorders, congenital heart disease, and surfactant defi ciencies, while in the childhood group (1-5 years) IPAH and pulmonary fi brosis account for the majority of cases. In children older than 6 years, the most common indication is CF [ 16 ] . The median survival is comparable to the adult group at 5.3 years with bilateral/double recipients faring much better than single lung recipients. There has been a steady decline in the number of combined heart-lung transplants in adults since 2000 with median survival rates in patients transplanted in the most recent era now similar to the lung group (5.6 years). Patients with CF , congenital heart disease, and IPAH constitute the vast majority of these cases.",

            "text": "Historically, the \"time on the wait list\" has been the traditional approach to prioritizing and apportioning lung allografts. In 2005, the lung allocation score ( LAS ) was introduced in the United States to prioritize patients on the wait-list for lung transplants based on the urgency of the patient's condition and the likelihood of survival after transplant [ 17 ] . The LAS represents a paradigm shift in transplant medicine utilizing a statistical modeling approach that calculates a \"waiting list urgency measure\" and a \"posttransplant survival measure.\" A numeric transplant benefi t is calculated from the simple subtraction of these entities and then a normalized LAS is enumerated by a mathematical formula. The LAS score then determines the placement with higher scores refl ecting sicker patients with greater expected benefi t. Although still controversial, there are published data showing reduction of both the number of deaths on the waitlist and waitlist times (from years to months) [ 18 -20 ] . It has also led to an increase in the proportion of patients transplanted for IPF and a decline in those transplanted for COPD [ 15 ] . There have been a number of recent studies that have shown that the overall survival time has not changed, refl ecting the problem that sicker patients are now being transplanted. Not surprisingly, patients with high LAS scores have higher post-transplant complications [ 20 ] . The LAS approach has also had an impact on the selection of transplant procedure (single versus bilateral/ double lung transplant) [ 21 ] . The impact of organ distribution in the pediatric setting is signifi cantly more controversial, particularly in children under the age of 12 years [ 22 , 23 ] . In this age group, the combination of group waitlist times and a Priority 1 scoring system is used [ 23 , 24 ] . The LAS system is utilized for children older than 12 years of age in the US. Infants may be considered for an ABO-incompatible procedure as they have not yet developed preformed antibodies against ABO blood antigens, but there is very little published clinical experience with this approach [ 25 ] .",

These refl ect in large part the accumulated historical experience of transplant programs and a conservative approach to donor evaluation. Briefl y, the \" ideal donor \" would have most or all of the following characteristics : age under 55 years, ABO blood compatibility, normal chest X-ray, and absence or limited smoking history (<20 packyears), comparable size matching, graft ischemia time of less than 6 h, and absence of aspiration or septic episodes, prior thoracic surgery, prior malignancy, organisms on a sputum gram stain, or purulent secretions at the time of bronchoscopy. Strict adherence to these requirements has traditionally resulted in limited utilization rates of potential allografts in the range of 5-20 %. Over the past decade, a number of studies have questioned some or all of these criteria and many centers have focused on revised criteria to assess and potentially accept more donor lungs. Snell and colleagues have sub-classifi ed this \" extended donor pool \" into two groups: (1) General medi-cal issues such as prior history or age, and (2) Specifi c medical issues such as infection, pulmonary edema, etc. [ 27 ] . Both categories may have potential clinical consequences for the recipient such as late complications in the fi rst group and primary graft dysfunction ( PGD ) and other early complications in the second group. On occasion, the pathologist may be asked to perform frozen-section examination of a pulmonary nodule or consolidation in a potential donor situation. Tissue should be sent for microbiologic testing in all cases and histochemical or immunohistochemical staining for bacterial, fungal, or viral organisms should be obtained on the permanent sections as warranted.",

In addition to the living-related lobar donations described previously, attention is now focused on the potential role of cadaveric donation after circulatory cessation/determination of death ( DCDD ) . Based on a series of elegant experiments in a canine model by Egan et al. and other investigators, it was determined that the lung utilizes passive diffusion throughout the alveolar parenchyma rather than direct perfusion as a mechanism for aerobic metabolism. As a result, the lung has an extended period of viability following circulatory arrest [ 28 -30 ] . In several centers, this method of organ procurement has been adopted into their clinical programs. There are limited published survival results, but most series suggest comparable or slightly better results at time points in the fi rst 2 years after transplant [ 31 -34 ] .

Its severity is variable, but it can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Although some risk factors have been enumerated, there are no specifi c biomarkers. Recently, molecular techniques have been implemented and show promise for future clinical application. Kaneda and colleagues [ 42 ] investigated cytokine mRMA expression from lung biopsy samples obtained before implantation of the allograft. A step-wise logistic regression analysis for 30-day mortality found that the ratio of IL-6/IL-10 was most predictive ( p = 0.0013). Using a gene expression profi le technique, Anraku and colleagues [ 43 ] found that the overexpression of four genes ( ATP11B, FGFR2, EGLN1 , and MCPH1 ) was predictive for the development of PGF . In another study from the Toronto group [ 44 ] , lung allografts with low surfactant protein-A mRNA expression prior to implantation exhibited reduced survival. In their most recent molecular work, pre-implantelevated levels of IL-6 mRNA correlated with the subsequent development of the BOS component of chronic lung allograft dysfunction ( CLAD ) [ 45 ] . Other molecular approaches to the lung allograft have identifi ed innate immune and infl ammatory pathways that may be responsible for post-transplant parenchymal injury [ 46 , 47 ] .

Patients undergoing lung transplant for COPD, ILD , and collagen vascular disorders such as scleroderma have an increased risk for bronchogenic carcinoma in the native lung. In most cases, these are discovered incidentally at the time of transplant during the pathologic examination of the explant [ 63 , 64 ] . The prognosis depends on tumor stage. With the interest in extended donor and recipient criteria such as older age and light smoking history, the incidence of occult carcinomas is likely to expand. Other clinical scenarios for lung cancer in the transplant setting include lung cancer arising in the native lung after transplant and bronchogenic carcinoma occurring in the transplanted lung. An equally unique but controversial group is the cohort of patients transplanted specifi cally for pulmonary adenocarcinoma [ 65 -70 ] . Prior to the recently adopted multidisciplinary classifi cation of lung adenocarcinoma, these tumors were all grouped as \"bronchioloalveolar carcinoma \" or \" BAC .\" In the new scheme, tumors formerly called BAC are now classifi ed into nonmucinous lesions [adenocarcinoma in situ ( AIS ) , minimally invasive adenocarcinoma ( MIA ) , lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma ( LPA ) ] and mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2 ) . The majority of mucinous adenocarcinomas are thought to be invasive based on one or more of the current diagnostic criteria: size (>3 cm), amount of invasion (>0.5 cm), multiple nodules, or lack of a circumscribed border with miliary spread into the adjacent lung tissue [ 71 ] . In a recent review of the topic, Kachala and Murthy identify a total of 70 cases: two of the larger series represent a multicenter collection of data collected by the ISHLT Registry or the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database, and most of the reported studies are case reports or small case series [ 69 , 70 , 72 ] . None of the reports had rigorous application of the new nomenclature and applied terminology such as \"diffuse\" or \"multifocal BAC .\" Nonetheless, there are important points that should be emphasized from the studies. Firstly, although lung transplantation may be considered for highly selected patients with AIS and MIA , there is a signifi cant risk of local recurrence. De Perrot et al. reported recurrences in 13 of the 22 patients who survived the procedure ranging from 5 to 49 month; overall 5-year survival in the group was inferior to the lung transplant group (39 % versus 53 %) [ 69 ] . Bilateral lung transplant may be a superior option to limit recurrences. Secondly, the diagnosis must be established by surgical excision and not a small biopsy to fi rmly establish the pathologic classifi cation ( AIS versus MIA versus PLA). Interestingly, many of the transplant recipients showed a mucinous pattern that would be classifi ed as invasive adenocarcinoma in the current scheme. Thirdly, all patients should be carefully staged to exclude mediastinal nodal involvement. Finally, transplantation should be considered after failure of conventional medical treatment.

While we generally use a similar approach for handling explanted specimens, it is important to review the electronic clinical records and discuss unusual or uncommon diagnoses with the clinicians prior to the gross dissection. Specimen photography can be a helpful adjunct in the evaluation. The lungs are individually weighed and measured and any missing segments or lobes are noted. The lung explant is usually received in the fresh state and is infl ated through the bronchus with 10 % neutral-buffered formalin or other standard fi xative under slightly elevated passive pressures. We allow overnight fi xation. The pleural surface is examined for adhesions, disruptions, cobblestone change, scars, or retractions. Following retrieval of hilar lymph nodes and an en-face section of the proximal bronchovascular margins, we cut the lung in an axial plane to allow correlation with CT imaging. Sectioning along a sagittal plane is alternative approach for cases of pulmonary hypertension as it enhances the gross alterations of the vasculature. Historically, specimen angiograms or bronchograms were performed primarily as a research protocol [ 77 ] . We recommend at least one section per lobe, all hilar and peribronchial lymph nodes and multiple sections of any gross abnormality found on examination. We routinely perform a silver stain such as a Gomori-methanamine-silver ( GMS ) to exclude fungal airway colonization or active infection.

In some centers, asymptomatic patients are followed without protocol TBBx sampling and they reserve the biopsy for clinical indications such as new onset of symptoms or decline in pulmonary function [ 83 , 84 ] . The goal of surveillance biopsy is the identifi cation of treatable processes such as infection or acute rejection before allograft dysfunction develops, to identify potential risk factors for chronic airway rejection and ultimately to delay or prevent OB. This stems in large part from the poor sensitivity and specifi city of clinical signs and symptoms, radiological techniques and functional techniques in distinguishing acute rejection, infection, and airway anastomotic complications . As a result, the TBBx is widely regarded as the \"gold standard\" for the evaluation of the pulmonary allograft. TBBx is a safe, invasive procedure in experienced hands, but there are potential serious complications such as bleeding and pneumothorax [ 85 ] . There are also technical and interpretative issues. Many of the pathologic processes affecting the allograft are patchy in distribution and may be \"missed\" by TBBx ; these include ACR, LB, and OB . The criteria for the diagnosis and reporting of ACR and other forms of allograft rejection were established by the ISHLT and have undergone a series of modifi cations and revisions by the Lung Rejection Study Group in 1996 and 2007 [ 86 -88 ] . Arcosoy et al. [ 89 ] recently reported the interobserver variability for the grading of ACR; a central panel of transplant pathologists reviewed over 1500 biopsies from 845 patients performed at 20 transplant centers. The kappa value for interobserver agreement was 0.183. Cases were upgraded from no rejection to ACR in 9 % of cases, downgraded from treatable rejection categories to no rejection or low-grade rejection in 35 % of cases, and cases of low-grade rejection were downgraded to no rejection in 36 % of cases and upgraded to treatable rejection in 19 % (95 % CI 0.147-0.220). In many cases, the biopsies were deemed \"ungradeable\" using the ISHLT criteria. In another interobserver study of 59 biopsies for ACR, only moderate agreement was shown between pathologists (kappa 0.470). There was less robust agreement for the diagnosis of either airway infl ammation or OB . Excellent intraobserver agreement, however, was found (kappa 0.795) [ 90 ] . In addition to the interpretative challenges, there are a number of technical issues. Tissue atelectasis and artifactual distortion are found to varying degrees with every TBBx sample. Gentle agitation of the biopsy pieces by a swirling motion of the formalin container can reduce atelectasis. The liberal use of leveled sections and connective tissue stains may resolve the problem of crush artefactual distortion and render a biopsy fragment interpretable in some cases.",

Historically, concern for persistent air-leaks or bronchopleural fi stulas limited its indication to seriously ill patients who had failed anti-rejection or antiinfection therapy or who suffered from multiple suspected concurrent processes such as infection and PTLD . A limited number of studies published in the pediatric and adult transplant populations have shown similar fi ndings [ 100 -103 ] . The majority of patients underwent OLB by way of a mini-thoracotomy incision and the biopsies were usually performed in the early or late transplant periods. The most common indications were unexplained deteriorating pulmonary dysfunction after thorough clinical, serological, and bronchoscopic evaluation or the onset of new or persistent pulmonary infi ltrates or nodules. In 30-70 % of cases, a new diagnosis requiring therapeutic intervention or confi rmation of the clinically suspected diagnosis was achieved including acute rejection, OB, organizing pneumonia pattern, infection, and malignancy.",

Tissue should always be sent for microbiological cultures. We gently infl ate the wedge biopsy specimen with formalin using a 25-or 27-guage needle (Fig. 5 ) . This promotes tissue expansion of the airspaces and airways and prevents tissue atelectasis and architectural distortion. Following adequate fi xation time of at least 3 h, the wedge is thinly sectioned and submitted for overnight processing. Complications were reported in 5-25 % of cases and ranged from minor issues such as wound infection, postoperative pain, and prolonged airleaks to more serious problems such as respiratory failure and intra-thoracic bleeding requiring surgical re-exploration. Importantly, resolution of air-leaks occurred in all patients, although the course was protracted in some cases. The results of these small numbers of studies and our own experience support the use of VATS biopsy for specifi c clinical indications . ",

The presence of preformed circulating anti-HLA Type I or II or anti-ABO antibody against donor antigen triggers the complement system resulting in acute clinical dysfunction and morphological alterations. Currently, a handful of case reports have been published detailing the pathological changes [ 104 -111 ] . Clinically, patients present with abrupt onset of respiratory failure with a sharp increase in mean pulmonary artery and airway pressures, release of copious amounts of bloody, frothy fl uid into the airways, dramatic decline in pulmonary compliance, and a drop in both systemic blood pressure and arterial oxygenation. Radiological changes rapidly progress to \"whiteout\" of the transplanted lung. Of the eight cases detailed in the literature, all but one were female, six occurred in patients with emphysema, fi ve had negative pretransplant studies for panel reactive antibodies (PRA), and three patients had elevated PRA. Death occurred in six patients despite aggressive intervention with plasmapheresis and potent immunosuppressive drugs. Currently, the primary goal is prevention of HAR by identifying patients at high risk, e.g., prior pregnancies, transfusions or transplantation, or underlying connective tissue disorders, and depletion of PRA by plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) prior to transplant in presensitized patients. The lung in HAR is heavy, fi rm in consistency, and purplish-red in color. Microscopically, the changes range from fl orid pulmonary edema with fi brinous exudates in the airspaces, to conspicuous neutrophilic infi ltrates within the septal walls with necrosis (acute capillaritis) and/or fl ooding of the airspaces with blood and neutrophils to classic DAD with hyaline membrane formation and endothelial and epithelial injury (Fig. 6 ).

In CMV pneumonitis , however, there is a predominance of interstitial and septal changes over the perivascular fi ndings. Secondly, prominent perivascular edema, small neutrophilic microabscesses, cytological atypia of the alveolar lining cells, and concurrent acute airway infl ammation favor infection over ACR [ 147 ] . Consequently, the diagnosis of ACR is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be evaluated together with available clinical, serological, immunohistochemical, and microbiologic information. In cases where the distinction remains unresolved, the Lung Rejection Study Group recommends that the pathologist indicates which process is favored and recommend a prompt repeat biopsy after an appropriate period of antimicrobial therapy [ 87 ] . Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue ( BALT) is part of the normal airway immune defense mechanisms and is composed of mural nodular infi ltrates in small airways (distal small cartilaginous bronchi and terminal bronchioles) at their branching points. In most cases, its nodular confi guration and distribution confi rm the diagnosis. Small vessels in the walls of the airways can display a circumferential infl ammatory cell cuff as part of BALT and should not be confused with ACR. In some cases, the use of additional leveled sections is helpful in demonstrating the airway locale; alternatively, IHC shows collections of CD20+ B-cells in BALT foci. The confusion of BALT for ACR accounted for some of the discrepancy in the ACR readings between local and central pathologists in the study by Arcasoy and colleagues [ 89 ] . Mononuclear cellular collections within interlobular septa in the absence of a perivascular distribution likewise should not be classifi ed as ACR.

Firstly, it is not uncommon to fi nd different patterns of severity of ACR in a transbronchial or VATS biopsy. For example, one piece of tissue may display a pattern of minimal rejection and another show mild or moderate ACR. The designated grade is based on the most advanced grade of rejection and not the predominant pattern. Secondly, some samples may exhibit ACR, but with less than the recommended fi ve pieces of alveolated tissue. We advocate a descriptive diagnosis such as \"Mild acute rejection in a suboptimal/borderline adequate sample\" and refrain from a numeric grade to alert the clinician to the ACR. The concern for a higher grade of ACR in the lung must be considered in this setting. Thirdly, the diagnosis of ACR requires that the infl ammatory infi ltrate is completely circumferential around the vessel. The arrangement can vary from compact, \"tight\" collections to more loosely arranged cuffs. The problem of a partial rather than complete cuff is not uncommon. Additional leveled sectioning of the paraffi n block resolves many of these problematic cases. In equivocal cases, we report the fi ndings and recommend careful clinical and microbiological correlation to exclude an infectious etiology. Fourthly, it is not uncommon to fi nd a number of different pathologies in a TBBx sample [ 148 ] . For example, we have observed concurrent cases of ACR and OB in patients transplanted more than 1 year. All signifi cant fi ndings should be documented in the pathology report irrespective of the overall adequacy of the sample.",

As described previously, ACR can have concurrent airway mononuclear infl ammatory cell infi ltrates. If other etiologies (especially infection) are excluded, the infi ltrates represent airway rejection. In the absence of ACR, active small airway infl ammation without associated scarring is classifi ed as lymphocytic bronchiolitis , LB . The grading of airway infl ammation has been revised and simplifi ed since the 1990 and 1996 ISHLT versions (Table 3 ) . Currently, the previous minimal and mild LB grades (previously B1 and B2) are compressed to low-grade small airway infl ammation and the numerical grade B1R is used to indicate the revised grade [ 88 ] . Low-grade LB is characterized by submucosal mononuclear infl ammation. The patterns range from patchy or scattered infi ltrates to circumferential bands of mononuclear cells (Fig. 14 ) . Eosinophils are found occasionally, but in small numbers, and by defi nition, mononuclear cells are not seen within epithelial cells. High-grade small airway disease and its numeric counterpart B2R replaced the moderate and severe LB grades (originally B3 and B4) of the previous grading scheme. It is defi ned by the presence of dense mononuclear cells in the bronchiolar submucosa including small and trans- formed lymphocytes admixed with other infl ammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and plasma cells in association with intraepithelial infi ltrates and epithelial injury. The degree of epithelial injury ranges from respiratory cell necrosis and metaplasia to epithelial sloughing, ulceration, and cellular and fi brinous exudates (Fig. 15 ) . Grade B0 is defi ned as the absence of airway infl ammation and Grade BX indicates that the biopsy specimen is ungradeable on account of absence of airways, tangential sectioning, artifactual distortion of airways, or infection.",

As previously discussed, a number of immunological, mechanical, and functional factors derived from the donor, recipient, surgical procedure and posttransplant management account for many of these predisposing factors. Not surprisingly, lung transplant recipients are perhaps the most suscep-tible of the solid organ transplant group and this risk extends to all pediatric and adult patients. For example, respiratory viral infections affect more than half of the pediatric recipients [ 187 ] . In our opinion, the most practical approach to the classifi cation of post-transplant infections is the temporal paradigm of Fishman [ 131 ] . In the 1-to 6-month period after transplant when patients are maximally immunosuppressed, opportunistic infections are most commonly encountered. These include the immunomodulating viruses of the herpes group ( CMV , EBV and others), fungal infections caused by Aspergillus species and Pneumocystis jiroveci , bacterial infections such as nocardiosis and mycobacterial infections, and rarely, parasitic infections [ 188 ] . After 6 months, most patients have achieved their lowest maintenance immunosuppression levels and are at risk primarily for community-acquired infections. Importantly, community-acquired respiratory viruses can cause serious clinical infections and trigger acute rejection episodes or promote the development of chronic rejection [ 189 ] . Opportunistic infections can also occur in the late period in patients treated with augmented immunosuppression for recurrent acute rejection episodes or to arrest the progression of BOS . With the widespread use of antimicrobial prophylaxis for specifi c bacterial, viral, and fungal organisms, new patterns and etiologies of infectious complication are now emerging [ 190 ] .",

Some centers use forced vital capacity (FVC) and the FEV 1 :FVC ratio as a surrogate marker of TLC [ 228 ] . The prognosis is poor and overall appears to be worse than BOS , although both share similar risk factors [ 229 ] . As this entity has only recently been recognized, the clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic details and diagnostic criteria remain to be fully elucidated. The radiologic fi ndings refl ect the ILD pattern of disease and include traction bronchiectasis, central and peripheral consolidation, pleural thickening, and volume loss in an upper lobepredominant distribution [ 227 , 228 , 230 ] . Interestingly, these fi ndings may be present prior to the onset of changes in pulmonary function tests. The histopathologic fi ndings have been described by Hwang and colleagues from Toronto [ 231 ] from wedge biopsy, postmortem, and retransplant specimens: pleural fi brosis and subpleural fi broelastosis were the most common fi ndings and most patients had concurrent OB either within or adjacent to the fi broelastotic regions and/or regions of DAD (Fig. 26 ) . Paraseptal, centrilobular, and parenchymal fi broelastosis were found in around a third of the cases. There was a sharp delineation of the fi broelastosis from adjacent \"normal\" lung tissue with foci of organizing pneumonia/fi broblastic foci in the intervening regions. Although honeycomb change was distinctly uncommon, NSIPlike changes were found in up to a quarter of cases. Currently, there is no directed or successful treatment for RAS.

There continues to be refi nement of selection criteria and expansion of both the indications for transplant and the overall number of candidates. The need for increasing the donor pool is critical. The use of \"marginal\" and reconditioned organs through EVLP has helped to identify organs that previously would have been considered unsuitable for transplant. Currently, there are only a few clinical EVLP programs in Europe and North America. With their continued achievements, the technology should become routine in most centers in the near future. This needs to be balanced with the risks of infection and PGD and their effects on overall survival, morbidity, and the risks for the development of CLAD. The therapeutic armamentarium must be expanded beyond conservative postoperative management for PGD and new interventions besides inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled surfactant, and C1-estaerase-inhibition must be found.",

            "text": "The diagnosis and treatment of ACR has become standardized and severe ACR is now uncommon. There have been very few new immunosuppressive drugs over the last decade in part because the challenges of drug development and multicenter trails are now daunting. Akin to the developments in PGD , the ideal approach would be to create personalized patient profi les through molecular technologies that would optimize immunosuppressive drug regimes, identify risks for infection, and CLAD. As the diminished costs and ever-increasing sophistication of molecular testing evolve, the concept of \"precision transplant medicine\" may become routine. AMR has become a recognized but perplexing entity in lung transplantation. The role of de novo DSA in the development of acute graft failure and later complications such as BOS and RAS is fi rmly established from the medical literature. With the recent formulations of defi nitions and Table 5 Recurrent pulmonary disorders in the lung allograft Sarcoidosis Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Pulmonary adenocarcinoma Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) Giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) Diffuse panbronchiolitis Pulmonary Langerhans' cell granulomatosis Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease diagnostic criteria, clinicians now have the opportunity to investigate AMR at multiple levels. The role of histopathology and immunopathology in particular is unsettled at this time. To date, there are no diagnostic histopathologic features for AMR and those with acceptable speci-fi city appear to be infrequent. Likewise, C4d immunostaining appears to be an infrequent fi nding in patients with allograft dysfunction and de novo DSA. A more specifi c set of pathologic markers will likely be required. At the present time, however, the pathologist plays an important CLAD has now evolved from the singular BOS to a number of additional entities such as RAS and neutrophilic-reversible/azithromycinsponsive allograft dysfunction. Unfortunately, CLAD continues to limit long-term survival and the pathogenesis is both complex and multifactorial. Like AMR, it requires a multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis and treatment options remain limited. The identifi cation of azithromycin as a novel therapeutic intervention for airway infl ammation in patients with BOS provides at least a temporizing step. Unfortunately, until more precise pathogenetic mechanisms are elucidated, preventative methods remain elusive.",
