Intraoperative blood product transfusion included whole blood, red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma and cell saver. In our center, the indication for use of cryoprecipitate to compensate fibrinogen or coagulation factors in OLT was a plasma fibrinogen level of <1.0 g/l. As another procoagulant product, fresh frozen plasma was used in (1) cases of excessive microvascular bleeding in the presence of a PT greater than 1.5 times normal or INR greater than 2.0, or an APTT greater than two times normal; (2) patients transfused with more than one blood volume and when PT or INR and APTT could not be obtained in a timely fashion. We stopped transfusing these procoagulant products when bleeding had been significantly improved as judged by the surgeon\u2019s experience and the parameters of coagulation and fibrolysis had reached the cutoff value from the following blood test report.

If the patient\u2019s SCR level remained elevated despite good urine output, the patient was maintained on a low-dose CNI to allow for renal recovery. For patients who remained oliguric, sirolimus was sometimes substituted for a CNI in the regimen. This regimen has also been adopted in other transplant centers [12].

Next, univariate logistic regression (Table 2) and multivariate logistic regression models (Table 3) were used to examine whether intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and other covariates had an independent effect on ARF following OLT separately. Then, Pearson\u2019s test and two-way ANOVA analysis were performed to discover the correlation between blood loss, Child-Pugh grade and cryoprecipitate transfusion (Figs. 1, 2). The \u03c7\n2 test was used to analyze the distribution of ARF in patients with and without cryoprecipitate transfusion. Then we explored the relationship between intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and ARF following OLT by the smoothing plot, with an adjustment for potential confounders (Fig. 3). We further applied a two-piecewise linear regression model to examine the threshold effect of the cryoprecipitate transfusion on ARF according to the smoothing plot (Table 4). The threshold level of cryoprecipitate transfusion at which the relationship between ARF and the cryoprecipitate transfusion level began to change and became notable was determined using a trial method. The trial inflection point was moved along a pre-defined interval and detected the inflection point that gave the maximum model likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Moreover, as the coagulation status during surgery changed constantly and the criteria for using fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate were not the same, many patients received fresh frozen plasma transfusion in addition to cryoprecipitate throughout the surgical procedure.

The impact of postoperative infection on patient\u2019s renal function has been widely accepted [5, 17]. From the perspective of pathophysiology, serious infection can result in systemic arterial vasodilation and intra-renal vasoconstriction, and it is also conducive to other kidney injuries [18, 19]. In addition, blood loss during the surgical procedure can lead to hemodynamic instability and hypotension after graft reperfusion [20, 21], so blood loss was considered another risk factor related to ARF [5]. As the current analysis found, these two factors were also associated with the occurrence of postoperative ARF. Preoperative renal dysfunction has been evaluated as a potential strong predictor of postoperative ARF [22, 23]. To minimize the influence on the results, we excluded patients with preoperative Scr levels greater than 133 mmol/l from the analysis. Moreover, the total volume of cryoprecipitate transfusion was affected by the severity of end-stage liver disease and the etiology, so Child-Pugh grade and etiology were also adjusted in the analysis. After adjusting for these potential confounders, we still found a significant correlation between intraoperative cryoprecipitate transfusion and the occurrence of ARF following OLT. Because the definition of ARF in the current study was stringent, it might also have skewed the results because of the relatively small group of patients examined. We also compared the postoperative Scr level between the groups with and without cryoprecipitate transfusion after ruling out all patients with ARF. The results indicated that the Scr level in patients receiving cryoprecipitate transfusion was significantly higher than in those who did not receive it. This led to the same conclusion, linking cryoprecipitate to renal toxicity in this setting.",

Its major components include fibrinogen, factor VIII/von Willebrand factor molecular complex (FVIII/vWF), factor XIII, fibronectin, platelet microparticles and immunoglobulin [25]. Patients with end-stage liver disease are characterized by reduced levels of coagulation factors, easily leading to coagulation disorders [26]. It is commonly thought that cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT can effectively provide fibrinogen and other coagulation factors to improve the function of blood coagulation and control intraoperative bleeding. This procedure is therefore widely applied in OLT centers. In our center, 40.4 % of patients had been transfused with cryoprecipitate at a mean volume of 12.8 U. Unfortunately, our study indicated that cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT is associated with the occurrence of postoperative ARF. More importantly, the data further revealed that the risk of ARF increased with the increase of cryoprecipitate transfusion until the critical point (16 U) had been reached. This also demonstrated that a more accurate criterion is needed to guide the use of cryoprecipitate so as to prevent the occurrence of ARF.",

However, there is no evidence base for this recommendation [30], and how to properly use cryoprecipitate transfusion in OLT for patients with end-stage liver disease remains controversial. Since there are some difficulties in real-time monitoring of the fibrinogen concentration during liver transplantation, blood test results play a lesser role in guiding the use of cryoprecipitate because of their time lag. Usually we can only determine the turnaround time for stopping the transfusion according to the surgeon's experience and the results of other tests, such as thrombelastography. Since the blood coagulation system is maintained in a state of low-level balance in patients with end-stage liver disease [31], this protocol to guide cryoprecipitate use may easily cause a coagulation imbalance. From a physiopathological point of view, microthrombosis formation caused by excessive blood clotting and hemodynamic changes caused by bleeding may both contribute to the occurrence of ARF.",

The main reason for this difference was ARF-related deaths. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is always the only choice for the clinician if conservative treatment is ineffective. ARF patients died not only from renal failure but sometimes also from co-morbidities induced by RRT such as sepsis and coagulopathy. It is known that the incidence of sepsis was significantly higher in OLT patients undergoing hemodialysis than in patients without hemodialysis [34]. Previous studies also have shown that ARF significantly increases mortality in OLT recipients [35, 36]. These conclusions were consistent with our findings.",

Interestingly, our analysis indicated that ABO blood group incompatibility may be associated with an increased risk of ARF following OLT. Because of the gradual reduction in the number of OLTs in ABO blood group-incompatible cases, multicenter and larger-scale analyses are required to support and validate this conclusion.",

However, cryoprecipitate is easy to obtain. Moreover, rational use of cryoprecipitate in OLT can effectively reduce blood loss and promote wound healing, so it is still being utilized in developing countries. However, due to the specificity of the blood coagulation system in patients with end-stage liver disease, how to use it properly in OLT remains controversial. Our study has shown that cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT is associated with postoperative ARF and might increase mortality within the first year. Cryoprecipitate transfusion during OLT should be performed cautiously until more convincing results from evidence-based medicine are available.",
