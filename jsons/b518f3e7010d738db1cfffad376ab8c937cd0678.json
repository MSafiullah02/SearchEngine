The risk of death within 15 days of admission was found to be higher in elderly male patients with a smoking history and underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and hypertension (Supplementary Table 1 ). Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors more commonly presented the symptoms of dyspnea (88.5%), chest tightness (66.0%) and confusion (15.4%) (Supplementary Table 1 ). The non-survivors also presented with lower lymphocyte counts and higher levels of ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein compared with the survivors (Supplementary Table 1 ). The majority of deaths were due to respiratory failure (88.5%), followed by cardiac arrest (5.1%) and shock (2.6%). Common complications among the death included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (97.4%), hyperglycemia (67.9%), myocardial damage (62.8%), liver damage (24.4%), and renal damage (38.5%). Systemic glucocorticoid treatment was more common in non-survivors. Instead, more survivors than non-survivors received lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (33.4% vs. 9%, and 76.4% vs. 53.8%, respectively) (Supplementary Table 1 ).",

The most influential risk factor was severe lymphopenia (< 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L), which was associated with a higher hazard for mortality (HR = 4.410) compared with a lymphocyte count > 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L. The presence of multiorgan dysfunction increased the hazard (HR = 1.273, per organ increase). Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavirt (HR = 0.350) was associated with a lower hazard [4] ( Table 1) . Low-dose glucocorticoid treatment (< 1 mg/ kg) or no glucocorticoid use was associated with a lower hazard compared with high-dose treatment (\u2265 1 mg/ kg) ( Table 1 ). The risk factors for mortality in the critically ill patients are shown in Supplemental Table 2 . However, in the critically ill cohort, the HR estimates were similar with and without systemic glucocorticoid therapy. This suggests glucocorticoid therapy requires strict control of indications [5] . The type of respiratory support (noninvasive vs. invasive ventilation) had no effect on mortality in critically ill patients (supplementary Table 2 ).",
