Additionally, separate definitions as follows were applicable for each category. Case reports were not used for treatment evaluation, otherwise there were no inclusion restrictions regarding types of studies. For in vitro studies, only assays with interpretable results were considered. Severe P. ovale malaria was determined on the basis of the 2014 WHO criteria for severe falciparum malaria [14] and other serious or life threatening clinical conditions as defined by the authors. As parasite counts are generally lower in severe P. ovale than in severe P. falciparum malaria [7] no threshold was determined for parasitaemia. A relapse was defined as a reappearing P. ovale parasitaemia following an initially diagnosed and adequately treated P. ovale \u201cprimary infection\u201d (regardless of 8-aminoquinoline application) and subsequent permanent residence in a non-endemic country. The term \u201cprimary infection\u201d was used to describe the first reported P. ovale infection in the article, which was adequately treated (important for malaria infection studies, where patients were mostly not treated in case of self-limiting infection). The period between primary infection and relapse and two relapse events, respectively, was counted as time between the date of treatment and the first mentioned date of reappearance. In order not to confuse delayed primary attacks with relapses, articles where the primary infection was not explicitly stated to have been a P. ovale infection were excluded.",

Following elaborations of underlying studies in the WHO guideline however rather break this down to experience [38]. In this systematic review, no high-quality studies supporting current treatment recommendations were identified. Not a single randomized controlled clinical trial on P. ovale malaria has been published in scientific literature. This finding is supported by a report by Visser et al. [37]. Although chloroquine has been tested in small prospective uncontrolled trials, one might question whether this small number of participants and a lack of control groups in all studies provide enough evidence for unequivocal treatment recommendations. Summing up all published reports and clinical experience, it becomes evident that anti-malarial drugs employed for P. falciparum are also effective for P. ovale.

The description of these histological structures resembles the findings of Krotoski described for Plasmodium cynomolgi bastianelli in Rhesus monkeys (average diameter 4.5 \u00b5m) and for P. vivax in chimpanzees (approximately 4\u20135 \u00b5m diameter) [50, 51]. However, this analogy does not constitute proof that these uninucleate structures truly represent hypnozoites or rather retarded forms. Furthermore it does not provide evidence for these structures to cause relapse events [48].

When Sinton and Bird observed that pamaquine reduced the relapse rate of P. vivax malaria [56] several 8-aminoquinoline derivatives were synthesized and tested for this purpose. Primaquine finally showed a higher anti-relapse effect than pamaquine with reduced toxicity among the most promising substances, but effectiveness for P. ovale relapses has since then only been presumed and never demonstrated [57].

To overcome that difficulty, the analysis was restricted to cases, which did not reside in a malaria endemic area between the occurrences of primary infection and relapse. In addition, the species of the primary infection had to be explicitly mentioned to be P. ovale and treated with anti-malarial chemotherapy. Comparing the results of this systematic review with those of Richter et al. [52], these strict criteria are the main reason why even fewer cases of potential relapses were observed here.",

After personal communication with one of the authors (Fuehrer) the confirmation for this potential relapse case was based on the sequence homology of partial cox1, SSU rRNA, and porbp2 loci between the primary and the potential relapse isolate [60]. These markers are usually not used for intraspecific distinction but for differentiation between the species. The multigene approach, however, enhances the significance of the result. In summary, the identification of highly sensitive genetic markers or techniques that can discriminate between hypnozoite induced relapse and other sources of recurrent infections is still a work in progress.",
