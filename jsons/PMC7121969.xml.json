Lung transplant recipients, among all other solid organ transplant recipients, appear to be particularly susceptible to CMV disease, recurrences, and antiviral resistance. In the early era of lung transplantation, prior to widespread use of ganciclovir-based prophylaxis, symptomatic CMV disease including CMV pneumonitis was very common, occurring in up to 60\u201380 % of patients [1]. The highest-risk group was identified as the donor-seropositive, recipient-seronegative (D+/R\u2212) group, which corresponds to the introduction of CMV from the donor organ into a recipient without antecedent CMV immunity and, thus, limited ability (at least initially) to limit viral replication. In studies by Zeevi and others, the development of CMV-specific immunity was shown to be delayed in some D+/R\u2212 lung recipients, although most did develop such immunity eventually [2]. In most early studies, both CMV disease and donor CMV-seropositive serology were associated with worse outcomes, including increased risk of BOS, shorter time to BOS, and/or mortality [3\u20137]. In some studies, use of CMV prophylaxis was associated with decreased mortality [3] or delayed onset of BOS [1].",

Studies in animal models (rat tracheal allografts) have supported the hypothesis of a causative role for CMV, in that obliterative bronchiolitis was accentuated by CMV and prevented by ganciclovir prophylaxis or hyperimmune serum [8]. In this model, CMV effects were accompanied by increases in interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression and a decrease in interleukin-10 expression [8]. Wiebe et al. found that both rat CMV and bacterial infection increased chronic airway rejection in a rat model, and this process was associated with increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on endothelium, as well as increased numbers of infiltrating leukocytes and ED-1 positive macrophages [9].",

Recently, the impact of treated CMV pneumonitis in the prophylaxis era has been reassessed, with studies showing disparate results: both a decreased impact [15] and a continued adverse impact [16, 17] of CMV pneumonitis on allograft function have been reported. Tamm et al. studied 341 lung recipients, including 151 with CMV pneumonia who were treated with ganciclovir, and 190 without CMV pneumonia. There were no significant differences in BOS or in patient survival at 1, 3, and 5 years [15]. There was also no association between CMV donor/recipient serostatus and BOS or survival [15]. Snyder et al., however, reported that there was an association between treated CMV pneumonitis and BOS. [16]. In 231 patients transplanted between 2000 and 2004, 1,887 biopsies were performed including CMV immunostaining. CMV pneumonitis developed in 49 (21 %). Treated CMV pneumonitis within the first 6 months increased the risk of BOS (hazard ratio 2.19) and death (hazard ratio 1.89). This remained significant in multivariable analysis [16]. Similarly, Valentine et al. assessed the impact of respiratory infections due to a variety of pathogens and found that CMV pneumonitis in the first 100 days increased BOS risk with a hazard ratio of 3.1 [17]. In another study, Valentine et al. reported that indefinite ganciclovir prophylaxis was associated with long-term freedom from CMV pneumonitis, but that in the group of patients who stopped prophylaxis, 38 % developed CMV pneumonitis, and 50 % of these developed BOS within 1 year [18].\n",

In the current era, several important differences have emerged as compared with the earlier era. CMV pneumonitis has notably declined, comprising, for example, only 4.3 % of a set of 559 respiratory infections in lung recipients in a study by Valentine et al. [19]. Longer-term viral suppression has become an option because of the availability of oral valganciclovir. In a randomized, multicenter study, CMV events and severity were significantly decreased in the group receiving 12 months as compared with 3 months of valganciclovir prophylaxis [20]. This benefit was maintained out to >4 years in a single-center subgroup [21]. Whether this enhanced freedom from CMV events improves the lifespan of the allograft is still a question. As mentioned above, the study by Valentine et al. of increased CMV pneumonitis and BOS in the group that stopped prophylaxis has led this group to call for indefinite long-term prophylaxis [18].",

There has also been increasing recognition in other solid organ transplant recipients of the importance of subclinical CMV infection on allograft function (e.g., cardiac allograft vasculopathy in heart recipients) [26, 27]. Whether such early detection, particularly of late CMV after cessation of prophylaxis, improves allograft function for lung recipients also remains to be shown. Given the results of Bauer et al. regarding CMV detection in epithelial lining fluid, it has been questioned whether monitoring of viremia is adequate for early detection [14]. Disparities in results between groups in the current era may also reflect more subtle differences.

On the other hand, Ross et al. found a possible association between HHV-7 detection and bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia after lung transplantation [32]. The possible role of EBV was studied by Engelmann et al., who monitored 385 lung transplant recipients for CMV (by pp65 antigenemia assay), EBV DNA, and adenovirus DNA in blood [33]. Over half of the patients had EBV DNA detected on at least one occasion, and repeated EBV DNA detection was associated with BOS risk [33]. Diagnosis of BOS prior to study entry, retransplantation, and the use of sirolimus or everolimus were associated with detection of EBV [33]. This latter finding was somewhat surprising, as the sirolimus group of immunosuppressive agents has been thought to have a protective effect with respect to viral infections as compared with other immunosuppressive agents [34].",

Differences in baseline patient populations, immunosuppression, prophylaxis, and detection methods might account for some of the differences in findings, but these remain largely unexplained. Manuel et al. hypothesized that prolonged antiviral prophylaxis, while not preventing viral reactivation within the allograft, might mitigate some of its damaging effects [35].

Such infection may be asymptomatic or may involve the upper or lower respiratory tract. Occasionally infectious syndromes can be severe enough to warrant ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. In addition to such dramatically symptomatic episodes, however, less symptomatic but truly chronic infections have also been documented, even with the comparatively underrated and ubiquitous rhinovirus [36]. The major question with regard to CARVs (in addition to the direct infectious syndromes they produce) is the indirect and longer-lasting effect on the allograft. Mechanisms are being investigated, and recent attention has focused on the increase in the chemokine receptor CXCR 3 and its chemokine ligands. Weigt et al. compared BAL fluid in CARV and non-CARV-infected lung recipients and found that elevated levels of CXCL 10 and CXCL 11 correlated with greater decreases in FEV1 when measured 6 months after the initial infection episode [37].",

Kumar et al. studied 100 patients from 2001 to 2003, comparing 50 patients with clinically diagnosed viral respiratory infections and 50 who were asymptomatic [38]. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs revealed viral pathogens in two-thirds of the group with clinical respiratory infection [including rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus]. The incidence of acute rejection and of decline in FEV1 over 3 months was significantly higher in the viral respiratory infections group, and for some patients, the decline in FEV1 was sustained out to 1 year [38]. A more recent prospective study by this group utilized a multiplex panel of molecular detection assays for 19 viruses on BAL samples of 93 lung recipients. Eighty-one BAL samples were positive for viruses; rhinovirus was detected in 46, and smaller numbers of recipients had parainfluenza, coronavirus, influenza, metapneumovirus, or RSV. Acute rejection or \u226520 % decline in FEV1 over 3 months occurred in 33.3 % of virus-positive vs. 6.7 % of virus-negative patients (p = 0.001). This was true regardless of whether the viral infection was symptomatic or not [39]. In another study, Gottlieb et al. followed 388 lung recipients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal viral swabs for 12 community respiratory viruses and found that 7.7 % of patients manifested a CARV infection. BOS occurred at 1 year in 25 % of CARV-positive patients vs. 9 % of CARV-negative patients (p = 0.002) [40]. RSV and parainfluenza virus appeared to have more of an effect than rhinovirus and coronavirus. Symptomatic CARV remained a risk factor for BOS in multivariable analyses but did not appear to influence progression of preexisting BOS [40]. Khalifah et al. followed 259 adult lung recipients and found that CARV infection was associated with BOS, death, and death from BOS [41]. In this study, these effects were particularly strong for lower-tract CARV infection [41]. In a study by Vilchez et al., parainfluenza virus was especially strongly associated with subsequent BOS (32 %) [42].",

While bacterial infections in general have been identified as a risk factor for BOS [6, 49], Pseudomonas has been of particular interest [50]. It has been noted since the early days of lung transplantation that infection and colonization with Pseudomonas spp., including multidrug-resistant strains, is extremely common in lung recipients [51, 52]. Whereas many CF and bronchiectasis patients are colonized with Pseudomonas pre-transplant, Pseudomonas may also be acquired de novo post-transplant in any recipient, and is associated with an intense inflammatory response [52]. In one study by Botha et al., de novo acquisition of Pseudomonas was associated with increased risk of BOS within 2 years (23.4 % vs. 7.7 %, p = 0.006) [53]. Pseudomonas colonization preceded BOS by a median of 204 days [53]. Gottlieb et al. reported that Pseudomonas colonization post-transplant in CF patients was a risk for BOS, whereas eradication of previous Pseudomonas colonization was associated with less frequent BOS (p = 0.006) [54]. In addition, a variety of both enteric (E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus, etc.) and non-enteric gram-negative organisms (Stenotrophomonas, Alcaligenes, Acinetobacter, etc.) may be isolated from post-transplant BAL cultures, particularly in those patients with airway complications and/or protracted post-transplant recovery and ventilator courses. Burkholderia cepacia complex has been associated with high mortality post-transplant (particularly B. cenocepacia or genomovar III), although much of that mortality is due to direct infectious syndromes rather than long-term effects of colonization.",

Glanville et al. reported that C. pneumoniae was detected in BAL samples in 25 % of lung recipients and was associated with higher risk for early mortality, acute rejection, and BOS [61]. In another study by Kotsimbos et al. [62], Chlamydia D+/R\u2212 status was associated with a BOS incidence of 75 %; whereas low anti-C. pneumoniae titers in the donor and high anti-C. pneumoniae titers in the recipient were found to be predictive of freedom from BOS, suggesting that stronger antecedent recipient immunity to C. pneumoniae might be helpful in ameliorating effects of donor-derived C. pneumoniae in the allograft [62].",

            "text": "Fungal infections, particularly aspergillosis, have long been identified as a source of morbidity and mortality in the lung transplant recipient [19, 49, 65]. Risk factors are described in the section on prevention below. Traditionally, fungal processes have been defined as invasive fungal infection or as colonization. The effects of fungal infection on the allograft have been less frequently studied than those of viral or bacterial infections. Valentine et al. identified fungal pneumonia as a significant risk factor for subsequent BOS [17]. Recent intriguing evidence from Weigt et al. has demonstrated that aspergillus colonization, even in the absence of invasive infection, is a risk factor for BOS and BOS-related mortality, independent of acute rejection [66]. Aspergillus colonization preceded BOS by a median of 261 days in this study [66]. However, neither fungal colonization nor pulmonary fungal infection was identified as a risk factor for chronic allograft dysfunction in a study of 55 pediatric lung recipients by Liu et al. [67], although pulmonary fungal infection was associated with greater 12-month mortality in a large multicenter pediatric cohort [68]. It would be of interest to determine whether there are differential effects of different antifungal prophylaxis strategies. The changing landscape of antifungal prophylaxis, particularly the shift towards voriconazole and away from itraconazole, is of interest [69, 70]. Although antifungal prophylaxis has traditionally been undertaken with a goal of preventing invasive fungal infection, perhaps the results of Weigt et al. (described above) will prompt reassessment of current antifungal prophylaxis strategies with an eye to decreasing colonization as well. In particular, it could be asked if the addition or substitution of inhaled amphotericin or liposomal amphotericin preparations [71, 72] might lead to decreased airway fungal colonization compared with systemic-only antifungal strategies, and long-term benefits to the allograft should be further explored.",

If CMV does pose a significant risk for BOS development, an important question is whether the key risk factor is symptomatic CMV disease, subclinical viremia, or subclinical replication in the lung compartment [14]. As discussed above and summarized in Table 11.1, some but not all studies have suggested a beneficial effect of CMV prophylaxis on decreasing BOS risk. A variety of prevention strategies are effective in preventing symptomatic CMV disease, but prevention of subclinical viremia likely requires longer prophylaxis or preemptive therapy (or both), since asymptomatic viremia might otherwise occur without detection. As mentioned above, Valentine et al. called for indefinite prophylaxis, related to the finding that the group that stopped prophylaxis had high rates of CMV pneumonitis and progression to BOS within 1 year [18]. From the randomized, controlled trial by Palmer et al., it is known that CMV outcomes are significantly decreased with a 12-month course of valganciclovir prophylaxis compared with a 3-month course, but whether that benefit translates into improved long-term results for the allograft needs to be investigated further.",

Influenza immunization has been shown to be safe in transplant recipients, as larger studies have not corroborated any clinically significant increase in rejection or allograft dysfunction in solid organ transplant recipients [74]. The efficacy of influenza vaccine may be suboptimal, particularly in those recipients with recent transplants or intensified immunosuppression, but per current guidelines [74], partial protection is preferable to no immunization. It is also extremely important that family members and health care workers be immunized, to decrease risk of transmission of influenza to the patient. If the transplant recipient does acquire influenza despite these measures, early detection and antiviral treatment can reduce morbidity, including the need for ICU admission [75]. It is important to get this message out to primary care providers, urgent care, and emergency room clinicians, who may (rather than the transplant team) be the first to assess a transplant recipient with a viral illness. Each year the types of circulating influenza strains and the patterns of antiviral resistance are different; clinicians should follow yearly updates from their national health organizations with each year\u2019s recommendations for antiviral therapy.",

Adherence to recommended precautions and to hand hygiene is essential, and programs that increase compliance with these measures will have a beneficial effect for all patients, including vulnerable transplant recipients. Health care workers with respiratory viral illnesses should ideally not have contact with transplant recipients at all, but if such contact is unavoidable, all possible measures should be taken to prevent transmission (including mask, gloves, limiting time in room, etc.). Transplant centers should develop policies that do not penalize employees for absenteeism due to illness. Educational efforts should emphasize that mild viral symptoms in a health care worker (that a worker might tend to ignore or to \u201cwork through\u201d) can translate into acute respiratory failure and/or long-term loss of allograft function in a lung recipient.

Many centers use ribavirin preparations for treatment of symptomatic RSV infection [76] and sometimes parainfluenza virus [77] and metapneumovirus infection as well [78], although further data would be welcome. Most literature to date has reported on aerosolized ribavirin, but inconvenience and potential toxicity to health care workers has led to the study of other ribavirin preparations. Glanville et al. described the use of intravenous ribavirin plus oral corticosteroids in 18 lung recipients, in whom an initial fall in FEV1 was followed by recovery at 3 months, and only one patient developed subsequent BOS [79]. Intravenous ribavirin is not currently available in the United States. Similarly, promising preliminary results from a study by Pelaez et al. demonstrated preservation of allograft function in a group of lung recipients with RSV who received a regimen of 10 days of oral ribavirin in combination with high-dose steroids for the first 3 days [80]. In addition, Fuehner et al. reported on a nonrandomized study of 38 patients who received oral ribavirin compared with 29 who did not, during paramyxovirus infection. Whereas both groups had declines in FEV1, a greater percentage of ribavirin-treated patients recovered lung function within 1 month (84 % vs. 59 %, p = 0.02). New-onset BOS within 6 months occurred in 5 % of the ribavirin vs. 24 % of the non-ribavirin-treated patients [77]. Novel therapies are also under development. A recent study of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment for RSV infection demonstrated a decrease in new-onset BOS and progression to BOS by day 90 in the treatment group (n = 16), as compared with others (n = 8) who received standard care for RSV infection (6.3 % vs. 50 %, p = 0.027) [81]. The likely availability of other antiviral therapies in the future would make larger, multicenter comparative effectiveness trials that include long enough follow up to detect effects on time to BOS desirable.",

Such strategies might include individualized peri-transplant combinations of systemic and inhaled antibiotics, as well as pre-transplant attention to potential reservoirs such as the sinuses. If effective vaccines for prevention of Pseudomonas infection and colonization become available in the future, that would be an important intervention.

Transplant recipients should be educated about the risks of marijuana smoking, gardening, farming, construction work, composting, cave exploration, and other activities that they consider undertaking as they recover from the initial post-transplant phase and begin to resume a more normal life [85]. Antifungal prophylaxis is now utilized by many lung transplant programs, most frequently using azole antifungal agents, inhaled amphotericin preparations, combinations of the above, and sometimes other agents [69, 70]. Regarding the type of azole used, there has been a shift from itraconazole towards voriconazole over time [70]. However, even in the presence of antifungal prophylaxis, breakthrough fungal infections may occur. In fact, antifungal prophylaxis may select out for certain types of fungal organisms (e.g., zygomycetes in the setting of voriconazole prophylaxis.) Protocol BALs can help with detection of fungal colonization in the asymptomatic patient and might prompt either a change of prophylaxis or increased clinical and radiographic monitoring or both. The occurrence of fungal infections late in the post-transplant course (after discontinuation of prophylaxis) might be related to late rejection, environmental exposures, or a reservoir in the native lung for single-lung transplant recipients. An enhanced clinical awareness in patients falling into any of the above groups is helpful.",
