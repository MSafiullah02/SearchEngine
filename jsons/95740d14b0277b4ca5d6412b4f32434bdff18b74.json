The symptoms include rhinorrhea, soreness of throat, sometimes hoarseness, and initially an irritant cough which later becomes loose. There is general malaise, but usually not any fever, at least in the older child and adult. Some authors use the term \"upper respiratory-tract infection\" (or \"URI\") for the same symptom complex. Other synonyms include \"cold\", \"head cold\", and \"chest cold.\" In daily conversation it is clear that everybody understands what is meant by having a \"cold\" or a \"Schnupfen, Erkfiltung\" in German, \"rhume\" in French, or \"raffredore\" in Italian.",

Major pediatric textbooks devote no more than one-half to two pages to this illness, and formal teaching about the common cold is seldom offered in medical schools or continuing medical education courses. Among the public, victims of this illness are more often guided by television advertising and word-of-mouth lore than informed of sound medical principles.",

Despite the benign course, 95% of a group of physicians who participated in a prospective study of prescribing habits gave one or more prescription drugs to patients with the common cold, and 60% of these prescriptions were for antibiotics [39] .",

Five million of these patients were seen by a physician, and 215,000 were admitted to a hospital for a total of 742,800 hospital days. The estimated cost in 1973 was 143-211 million Canadian dollars. Extrapolation to the United States at 1984 prices would bring the sum to nearly 5 billion dollars per year. Gwaltney [14] estimated that 55 million school and work days were lost for the same reason in 1969.

The incubation period appeared to be about 48 h.\" They further showed that the frequency of illness was not affected significantly by the bacterial flora of the nasopharynx or by the climate, but was related to the arrival of supply ships. A study done later on Tristan da Cunha, a South Atlantic island with a population of 200 people, gave similar results [43] .",

Gardner and colleagues [12] , studying viral infections in infants from birth to first birthday, attributed 18% to rhinoviruses and the rest to respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, adenovirus, influenza A and B, and picornaviruses. Hable and co-workers [19] at our institution, by pharyngeal culture alone, were able to isolate rhinovirus from just 6 of 490 children who had a variety of upper respiratory-tract infections. In addition to the difficulty of isolating the virus, differences of protocol may cause disagreements between study results. Patients at the Mayo Clinic actively sought medical care, perhaps because of the severity of symptoms, whereas in other epidemiologic studies the investigators took the initiative.",

The preschool child is symptomatic 20% of the time or almost 2.5 months of each year, and the child in school suffers from these symptoms a cumulative total of 1 month of the year. Longini and associates [26] found the attack rates with rhinovirus were highest in subjects 0-4 years old and declined gradually to age 65 and older. This report agrees with the observation that newborns have antibodies to about 20% of rhinoviruses. The number falls sharply during the 1st year of life and then gradually rises again [15] . There is no convincing evidence that breast feeding protects against the common cold, nor is the presence of atopic diathesis clearly associated with an increased number of infections. Parental smoking, at least in one study, had no effect on the frequency of infection of infants [12] . Presence of preschool siblings increased the infection rate, but the presence of a school-age sibling did not. In the same study, no effect of socioeconomic class on the rate of infection in infants was noted [12] .",

For the future, one possibility may be the use of antiviral drugs with known efficacy against rhinoviruses. For example, nasal administration of antiviral drugs such as enviroxime or interferon a2 (IFN-a2, which was produced by recombinant DNA techniques), in experimentally induced rhinovirus infection, was found to reduce the level and duration of viral shedding and of nasal mucus production [21, 31, 32] . At present, it is important that we teach our patients that we can relieve significant symptoms but that drugs should not be used indiscriminately whenever there is slight discomfort. It is best to treat specific symptoms that are causing significant problems and to reassure the patient by teaching him or her what to expect during the course of the illness. Actually, patients eventually stop using any medication for colds; and in most instances they are not ill-served by this decision.",
