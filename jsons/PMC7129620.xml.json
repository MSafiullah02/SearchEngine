            "text": "A detailed evaluation of all human pathogens a few years ago demonstrated that the majority of infectious species affecting humans are of a zoonotic nature [3]: of the 1415 species recorded as pathogenic for humans in 2001, 868 (a staggering 61%) could be characterized as zoonotic. Furthermore, the zoonotic nature of a pathogen has been unanimously considered to be an independent factor that increases its potential for emergence or re\u2010emergence: Emergence refers to the appearance of a newly recognized or newly evolved pathogen or the appearance of a known pathogen in a geographical area where it has never been recognized before. Re\u2010emergence similarly refers to known pathogens whose incidence in a given geographical area (ranging from a county to the world in the case of pandemics) is significantly increasing or whose ecology is newly altered, enhancing its potential to cause human disease (e.g. by using novel hosts, jumping from wild animals to domestic ones, exhibiting a wider vector range, and so on) [4]. As the vast majority of novel species pathogenic for humans recognized since 2001 are also of a zoonotic nature, including SARS coronavirus and novel H1N1 influenza virus (pandemic influenza of swine origin), one can presume that the spectrum of human infection attributed to animals is continuing to evolve and remains understudied with regard to its actual burden: The world of infectious diseases is currently dominated by multidrug\u2010resistant pathogens such as methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (both technically zoonotic pathogens), or Acinetobacter species and novel pan\u2010resistant strains: research and scientific publications are largely targeted towards such pathogens. The world of humanitarian relief and global public health campaigns is dominated by the big three, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Although the first is strictly a zoonotic infection, jumping species to humans from simians, and although the latter two are, at least in a minority of cases, depending on the species implicated, also zoonotic, it is not their zoonotic nature that has moved these infections to the centre of the Millenium Development Goals, for example [5]. Overshadowed by these scientific and public health targets, millions of people worldwide are susceptible to a wide array of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal zoonotic infections that cause millions of new annual cases, exhibit a considerate mortality toll, are often followed by debilitating chronic sequelae, and are directly correlated with a significant burden in terms of veterinary medicine, agriculture, livestock production, and regional and national economies. Zoonoses have been disproportionately neglected until recently, remaining the \u2018other diseases\u2019 of the Millenium Development Goals. Interest in the impact of certain of these neglected diseases, most of them zoonotic, has been slowly resurfacing [6] in terms of science and research funding, but many other zoonoses remain the true neglected \u2018neglected diseases\u2019.",

It should be noted that a zoonotic potential exists for numerous other major pathogens, including Enterococcus sp. and P. aeruginosa, and also for less frequent ones, such as Morganella morganii. However, the vertebrate animal reservoirs of these pathogens, as well as their animal\u2010related life cycles, are of minimal significance for the burden and evolution of human disease, at least at present; this is why such pathogens are not included in Table 1.",

However, the significance of the diseases caused by both of these viruses was related to their capacity for person\u2010to\u2010person transmission, and not their zoonotic nature, in contrast to, for example, the transmission of avian H5N1 influenza virus, for which animal contact is necessary. Neither of these new diseases would have emerged from the context of zoonotic infection and species jumping from animals to humans. In a historical context, the same could be said about human immunodeficiency virus. Person\u2010to\u2010person transmission is essential for dengue outbreaks and sustaining dengue virus in nature, with animals playing a minor role in this cycle; thus, dengue is not considered to be an essential zoonosis. In order for Table 2 to be more concise, viral pathogens that induce a minimal burden of human disease (in terms of cases recorded or geographical extent), e.g. eastern/western equine and St Louis encephalitis (roughly ten annual cases in the USA each), are not included. The same is true for viral pathogens that have been documented only occasionally in the past as pathogenic for humans.",

As is also easily seen in Tables 1 and 2, millions of annual cases of human disease are directly attributable to bacterial and viral agents with direct zoonotic correlations. The need for an interdisciplinary approach that extends beyond medical and veterinary specialists cannot be stressed strongly enough. Understanding the enormous economic burden of these diseases might assist international and regional decision\u2010makers in fully evaluating the huge effect of bacterial and viral zoonoses. The implementation of surveillance and prevention measures for these zoonotic infections might also allow for enhanced preparedness regarding the emergence or re\u2010emergence of similar pathogens with the potential to cause epidemics or pandemics.",
