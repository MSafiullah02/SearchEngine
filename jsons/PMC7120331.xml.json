            "text": "The beneficial effects of liquorice in treating chills, colds, and coughs have been fully discussed in Ayurveda, as well as in the texts of ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. The plant has been prescribed for dropsy during the period of famous Hippocrates. The reason being that it was quite helpful as thirst-quenching drugs (Biondi et al. 2005; Mamedov and Egamberdieva 2017). Although the clinical use of liquorice in modern medicine started around 1930, its effectiveness in the treatment of stomach and intestinal ulcers has been mentioned in the first century AD by Pedanios Dioscorides of Anazarba from Adana in present day Turkey, who is also regarded as the \u201cFather of Pharmacists\u201d. In Ayurveda, people in ancient Hindu culture have used it for improving sexual vigor. Chinese have been using it as a tea for strength and endurance (Davis and Morris 1991). The liquorice roots have been used in the traditional medicine against treating chest and lung diseases, pneumonia, bronchitis, arthritis, bronchial asthma, kidney diseases, heart diseases, gastric ulcer, mouth ulcers, coughs, swellings, excessive salivation, fluid retention, low blood pressure, allergies, catarrhs of the upper respiratory tract, liver toxicity, hyperglycemia, Addison\u2019s disease, and pancreatic disorders, flatulence, sexual debility, skin diseases, leucorrhoea, hoarseness, and certain viral infections (Blumenthal et al. 2000; Anonymous 2005; Armanini et al. 2002; Sharma et al. 2013; Mamedov and Egamberdieva 2017). In Europe, particularly Britain, France, and Germany, present-day pharmacopeias are in general agreement on the medicinal application of this plant. It is used for the treatment of influenza, eye diseases, uterine complaints, biliousness, liver disease, and arthritis as per the reports published on Indian medicine (Saxena 2005; Mamedov and Egamberdieva 2017). The plant is in use in China since very early times and has been applied to treat acne and pimples, nervous disorders such as hysteria, irritability, epilepsy, as well as reduce the toxic or drastic action of other herbs, and to harmonize herbal formulas (Zhu 1998). The studies undertaken by Kong et al. (1984) reveal that liquorice root extract is used to treat diarrhea in mice, whereas Hong et al. (1988) have demonstrated its strong diuretic activity in rats. G. glabra extract has also been used to treat emotional irritability in adults and stress (Tsuda et al. 1986; Shirinyan et al. 1988). The extract has also been used to treat allergic dermatitis and eczema (Sokolov and Zamotayev 1985; Sheehan and Atherton 1992). According to Yang et al. (2015), liquorice has been used for the treatment of gastro and respiratory diseases in traditional treatments as well as for the alleviation of toxicity to other drugs. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is also honored as the \u201cexcellent coordinator\u201d as it harmonizes the activities of other ingredients by promoting their rapid absorption into the bloodstream, organs, and target cells (Yang et al. 2015).",

In the Japanese Pharmacopeia, both G. uralensis and G. glabra are listed, but G. inflata is not in the list. G. uralensis, imported from China, is the major source of the medicinal liquorice used in Kampo medicines. The standards of the Japanese Pharmacopeia XV clearly make a mention the amount for use in the medicinal application of licorice in Kampo medicines; the minimum glycyrrhizin content in these is mentioned to be only 2.5% (Hayashi and Sudo 2009).",

In addition, it is available in China, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, and Mongolia, where the prevalence of viral hepatitis B and C is relatively high. Glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetinic acid, and licorice extracts are used in various over-the-counter drugs, including anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, in England, the glycyrrhetinic acid derivative glycyrrhetinic acid 3-\u03b2-O-hemisuccinate (carbenoxolone) is a prescription drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcers (Hayashi and Sudo 2009).",

Most Japanese people do not like the long-lasting sweet taste of glycyrrhizin; however, a more acceptable sweetness can be created by using a combination of glycyrrhizin and natural sugars or other sweeteners. Therefore, glycyrrhizin and licorice extracts are used as food additives in a variety of foods; such as snacks, instant noodles, and sauces contain licorice extracts. Glycyrrhizin is used in sweet foods such as sweet snacks, ice creams, and sherbets to enhance their sweetness. It is also used to reduce the saltiness of salty foods such as soy sauce, other sauces, savory snacks, Kamaboko (boiled fish paste), Tsukudani (fish boiled in soy sauce), tsukemono (Japanese pickles), and sausages in Japan (Hayashi and Sudo 2009).",

The former is produced by treating the extract with cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, and it is used as a sweetener because of it has higher solubility and better taste than the untreated licorice extract (Liu et al. 2000). The latter is obtained by enzymatic hydrolyzation of the licorice extract. The sweetness of this licorice is attributable to glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-glucuronide (Kuramoto et al. 1994), which imparts a strong sweetness that is approximately 941 times that of sucrose (Mizutani et al. 1994).",

Licorice not only imparts a sweet taste but also an aroma to tobacco, which makes it mild (Nieman 1957). It also prevents the desiccation of tobacco (Hayashi and Sudo 2009). The licorice extracts used in the tobacco industry are supplied by an American company, namely, MAFCO (Hayashi and Sudo 2009). The liquorice used for this purpose in Japan is imported from countries such as China and USA in 1987; USA, Israel, China, and India in 2007 (Hayashi and Sudo 2009). The trade statistics related to licorice extracts in Japan in 1987 and 2007. Japan imported large quantities (848,704 kg in 1987 and 458,179 kg in 2007) of licorice extracts for tobacco production from the USA, and the value for the same in 2007 was more than 500 million Yen (Hayashi and Sudo 2009).",

As per his observations, the chemical composition is significantly effected together with gas production, metabolizable energy (ME), DM, and CP degradability of the leaves of G. glabra by the maturity stage. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and condensed tannin (CT) contents increase with increase in the maturity stage whereas crude protein decreases. Gas production, DM, CP disappearance, and estimated parameters also decrease with increase in maturity. CP, ADF, and CT contents range between 16.19 and 26.93%, from 20.74 to 29.07% and from 1.57 to 10.83%, respectively (Kamalak 2006). The potential gas production and ME have been recorded to range from 65.34 to 72.12 ml/0.200 g of DM and from 10.14 to 12.12 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The effective DM degradability (EDMD) and effective CP degradability (ECPD) have given the values ranging between 58.70 and 70.59% and from 57.32 to 73.72%. Gas production, DM and CP disappearance, and estimated parameters of G. glabra leaves harvested at prebud stage are significantly higher than those harvested at mid and late flower stages. Gas production, DM and CP disappearance, and estimated parameters are negatively correlated with NDF, ADF, and CT, but show a positive correlation with CP. G. glabra harvested at the proper stage of maturity offers considerable potential as a high-quality forage for ruminants during critical periods in the semiarid and arid regions (Kamalak 2006).",

Almost 10,000 tones of liquorice root residues annually accumulate in some countries and must be properly treated, because the untreated residues produce unwanted environmental effects as these are phytotoxic (Medina et al. 2011). Their direct application to the soil is not suitable. No alternative use has been proposed for this waste in recent evaluations. The burning of this waste is strictly forbidden. Landfilling is costly; currently, nearly 40 dollars per ton are required to solve this problem which includes the transportation cost as well. This type of application is regarded as ecologically unfriendly solution, due to extensive production of greenhouse gases, especially methane, under the anaerobic conditions prevailing in landfills (Lou and Nair 2009; Medina et al. 2011).",

They suggest that it is possible to use these wastes as a peat substitute in growing media. They have also looked on their suppressiveness against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis (FOM)\u2014the causal agent of Fusarium wilt of melon. According to Medina et al. (2011), these wastes can be cocomposted. For this purpose, temperature-controlled forced aeration system with the coarse fraction of separated cow manure can be used for an enrichment both its nutrient content as well as microbial population. Thermophilic conditions prevailing in the pile for approximately 3 months allow the compost to get stabilized and reach an ambient temperature 110 days from the beginning. The resulting compost shows physical characteristics which are well comparable to the peat, with a high nutrient content and relatively low salinity, and no phytotoxicity is seen in the extract from compost, according to the cress germination test. They have grown tomato plants as well in compost which have shown enhancement in development when compared to the peat. The number of surviving FOM spores incubated in the compost has declined faster than in peat. Fusarium infected melon plants have survived much better if planted in liquorice compost, as compared to peat. It can be said that liquorice compost can serve as a peat substitute with preferable qualities as proposed by Medina et al. (2011). Latter workers have suggested that the waste can be successfully composted during a reasonable time period, provided enough inoculum and sufficient nutrients are supplied, for example, cattle manure. The composting duration of the chosen mix until full compost maturity (110 days) is reported to be much shorter than that of liquorice waste alone (Hadar and Mandelbaum 1986) and comparable to that of most types of organic matter, in spite of the recalcitrant nature of the waste from these roots (Gagnon et al. 1999; Shi et al. 1999). Medina et al. (2011) have also proposed that resulting compost has adequate chemical and physical characteristics for its use as a component of growth media, and its performance has been clearly demonstrated. The resulted compost has a potential nutritional effect, especially in terms of N and K. The compost negatively affects the survival rate of FOM spores and shows marked suppression against Fusarium wilt of melon. It therefore has a clear potential as an ingredient of growth media (Medina et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Lately, several clinical and pharmacological investigations have been undertaken, which demonstrate the antimicrobial activities of liquorice aqueous, ethanol, and supercritical fluid extract (Bodet et al. 2008; Park et al. 2008; Al-Turki et al. 2008; Jain et al. 2013). Such an activity in plant oils and extracts has been recognized since years. It has been indicated that it can be attributed to alkaloids, saponins, flavonoides, tannin, glycosides, and phenols (Shinwari et al. 2009). Antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract of G. glabra has been tested against Bacillus subtilis MTCC (121), Staphylococcus aureus MTCC (96), Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC (429), Escherichia coli MTCC (443), and one fungal strain Candida albicans. Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum growth have been reported (Patil et al. 2009). The inhibition by ethanolic extracts of G. glabra and their fractions has been shown by Meghashri (2009) as well. However, G. glabra methanolic extracts seem to show more fungicidal effect against Arthrinium sacchari and Chaetomium funicola (Hojo and Sato 2002). Tharkar et al. (2010) too have recorded the antifungal activity of G. glabra extracts. Similarly, Gupta et al. (2008) have published data related to the antimicrobial activity of G. glabra against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The liquorice extracts with ethanol, chloroform, and acetone show antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Stapphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Nitalikar et al. 2010). A high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes has been recorded with G. glabra extracts (Nand et al. 2012). The antibacterial effect of G. glabra extract against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Baillus subtilis has been enlightened by Varsha et al. (2013). According to the results published by Statti et al. (2004), G. glabra methanolic extract also shows antimicrobial activity against various strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9622, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 29852, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6361, and Escherichia coli ATCC 4350. An antibacterial activity of G. glabra extracts against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and B. subtilis has also been reported (Shinwari et al. 2009). The upper respiratory tract bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenza, and Moraxella catarrhalis studied by Tanaka et al. (2001) reveal that secondary metabolites obtained from Glycyrrhiza species show antibacterial activity against these. Licoricidin and coumarin derivatives like glycyrol, glycyrin, and glycycoumarin too exhibit high activity against all tested microorganisms. Glabridin derived from root of G. glabra has been found to be active against both yeast and filamentous fungi (Fatima et al. 2009). It has shown various biological activities like antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, and inflammation (Hatano et al. 2000; Fukai et al. 2002; Nerya et al. 2003). G. glabra essential oils also show an inhibitory effect against Aspergillus flavus (Ali 2013).",

Out of these, compounds 1 and 5 have shown potent antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1 and 2 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, while glycyrrhizol B (2) and gancaonin G (6) have shown more moderate activity (He et al. 2006). In all, 12 phenolic compounds have been isolated from the fractions of a supercritical fluid extract of G. uralensis roots (Villinski et al. 2014). Seven of the metabolites from this extract have been reported earlier. Moreover, four known components have been characterized from this material for the first time, namely, 1-methoxyerythrabyssin II (4), 6,8-diprenylgenistein, gancaonin G (5), and isoglycyrol (6), and one new isoflavan, licorisoflavan C (7). When licoricidin (1) was treated by these workers with palladium chloride larger amounts of licorisoflavan C (7) been produced together with two new isoflavans, licorisoflavan D (8); subsequently detected in the liquorice extract; and licorisoflavan E (9). A study on the antibacterial activity of compounds 1\u20139 against the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans and the periodontopathogenic Porphyromonas gingivalis has revealed that licoricidin (1), licorisoflavan A (2), and 7\u20139 show antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis (MICs of 1.56\u201312.5 \u03bcg/mL). Most potent activity against S. mutans has been recorded with 7 (MIC of 6.25 \u03bcg/mL), followed by 1 and 9 (MIC of 12.5 \u03bcg/mL). All these findings support the evidence for the therapeutic potential of liquorice extracts for the treatment and prevention of oral infections (Villinski et al. 2014).",

Compounds 1 and 3\u20135 have displayed significant activity against Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 13311 with MIC values ranging from 2 to 8 \u03bcg/mL. All compounds have been screened for their in vitro free radical scavenging activities using an in vitro microdilution DPPH assay spectrophotometrically. The tested compounds have exhibited IC50 values in the range of 0.18\u20130.56 mg/mL. This suggests that they show an activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid (IC50: 0.07 mg/mL). The investigations undertaken by K\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131bekmez et al. (2015) are the first phytochemical and bioactivity investigation on G. iconica.",

On the other hand, the extracts showing strongest antimicrobial effect have come from the specimens originating from habitats under anthropogenic pressure. This implies that the differences in the biological activities can be attributed partly to the influence of environmental factors (Karahan et al. 2016).",

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the both components has exhibited significant anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus activity (50\u2013100 \u03bcg/mL) against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro combination study has shown that isoliquiritigenin significantly reduces MIC of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics up to 16-folds, while liquiritigenin reduces up to 8-folds. Time-kill kinetics at graded MIC combinations (isoliquiritigenin/liquiritigenin + \u03b2-lactam) have indicated 3.27\u20139.79-fold and 2.59\u20133.48-fold reduction in the growth of clinical isolates of S. aureus, respectively. In S. aureus-infected Swiss albino mice model, the combination of isoliquiritigenin with oxacillin has significantly lowered the systemic microbial burden in blood, liver, kidney, lung, and spleen tissues in comparison with isoliquiritigenin, oxacillin alone as well as untreated control (Gaur et al. 2016).

The synthesized silver nanoparticle has exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The synthesized SNPs have exhibited potential anticancer activity and are reported to be nontoxic on mammalian Vero cell line.

Strain American Type Culture Collection 15517 of Aspergillus parasiticus has been used to perform antifungal susceptibility test. The tests have been followed according to clinical and laboratory standards institute document M27-A3, and the rate of aflatoxin production was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography technique after exposure to different concentrations of liquorice extract. Mohseni et al. (2014) have followed the quantitative changes in the expression of the aflR gene, analyzed by measuring the cognate aflR mRNA level with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. Their results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of liquorice extract on Aspergillus parasiticus growth at 500 mg/mL. A significant decrease in aflatoxin production has been recorded at the same concentration. The production of aflatoxin B1 has been entirely inhibited in 10 g/mL of the extract. A significant decrease has been observed in the level of aflR gene expression has after exposure of fungal cells to 500 g/mL of extract. The antifungal and antitoxin activities of the extract on Aspergillus parasiticus have revealed its antifungal features together with its effective ability to decrease aflatoxin production (Mohseni et al. 2014).",

Many reports have indicated antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizic acid with the ability to inhibit growth and cytopathology of hepatitis A and C (Crance et al. 1990; Van Rossum et al. 1999), and immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Hattori et al. 1989; Plyasunova et al. 1992). The glycyrrhizin and its derivatives from G. glabra do reduce the hepatocellular damage in chronic hepatitis B and C, and show antiviral activity against HIV-1, SARS-related coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, arboviruses, vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (Fiore et al. 2008). Glycyrrhizin also shows antiviral effect, through an inhibition of viral particle to cell membrane binding, or through cellular signal transduction mechanisms (Crance et al. 2003). 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid is reported as the promising biological alternative for the topical treatment of persistent vulvovaginal candidiasis (Pellatti et al. 2009). In vitro antiviral effects for viruses causing respiratory tract infections like influenza virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) too have been reported (Cinatl et al. 2003)",

            "text": "The potential use G. uralensis for treatment of human infection by enterovirus type 71 (EV71) which can cause life-threatening meningoencephalitis has also been investigated (Kuo et al. 2009). The treatment of viral hepatitis since the late 1970s with liquorice preparations is a well-known fact. Recently, many papers published depict that liquorice extract has significant antiviral activity against HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS), HSV, influenza virus (H3N2), rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella zoster virus, coxsackievirus, and enterovirus (Booth et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2013a; Kwon et al. 2010; Shebl et al. 2012). As against this, as far as a single compound is concerned, many compounds have been isolated from liquorice but only two triterpenoids, glycyrrhizin and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, have been reported to possess antiviral activity, with a significant positive impact on HIV, H3N2, HSV, DHV, HCV, PrV, and IAV (Yang et al. 2015). In addition, other virus types have been worked include the following: H5N1, herpes virus, influenza virus, and rotavirus (Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009; Matsumoto et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2012; Soufy et al. 2012; Michaelis et al. 2010; Sasaki et al. 2002; Kang and Lieberman 2011; Smirnov et al. 2012; Moisy et al. 2012; Sui et al. 2010; Hardy et al. 2012a; Baltina et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2015). The in vitro experiments with glycyrrhizin have shown that it inhibits HCV by suppressing the release of infectious particles (Matsumoto et al. 2013), HSV by depressing the cellular adhesion (Huang et al. 2012), influenza virus by reducing HMGB1 binding to DNA and suppressing interactions between viral macromolecules and host proteins (Moisy et al. 2012), HIV by preventing the virus from replication (Sasaki et al. 2002), and H5N1 not by interfering with H5N1 replication, but by controlling H5N1-induced proinflammatory gene expression (Michaelis et al. 2010). However, does glycyrrhizin inhibit virus replication still needs more research work. It also interacts with the cell membrane and reduces endocytic activity (Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009), and causes deregulation of generating the mature forms of viral mRNA encoding, which is a process important for viral stability (Kang and Lieberman 2011). The glycyrrhetinic acid is reported to show a significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication by reducing the amounts of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and NSP2 at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry, together with an effective inhibition of HIV-1 by reducing the accumulation of virus antigen p24 and protecting cells from the cytopathogenic action of the virus (Hardy et al. 2012a; Baltina et al. 2012).",

The structures of 1\u201313 have been identified on the basis of extensive NMR and MS data analysis. The sugar residues have been identified by gas chromatography and ion chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection after hydrolysis. For the first time, saponins containing a galacturonic acid (1\u20133) or xylose (5) residue have been reported from Glycyrrhiza species. Compounds 1, 7, 8, and 24 are reported to exhibit good inhibitory activities against the influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) in MDCK cells with IC50 values of 48.0, 42.7, 39.6, and 49.1 \u03bcM, respectively, versus 45.6 \u03bcM of the positive control oseltamivir phosphate. Moreover, compounds 24 and 28 have shown anti-HIV activities with IC50 values of 29.5 and 41.7 \u03bcM, respectively (Song et al. 2014). Adianti et al. (2014) have reported that glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol, and liquiritigenin isolated from G. uralensis, as well as isoliquiritigenin, licochalcone A. and glabridin, can be good candidates for seed compounds to develop antivirals against HCV. Glycyrrhizin demonstrates a pronounced lymphocytic proliferation response on white Pekin ducklings and reveals a good immune stimulant and antiviral effect against DHV following in vivo studies (Soufy et al. 2012). A protective effect is exerted by a combination of glutamyl-tryptophan and glycyrrhizin in reducing the death of H3N2 virus-infected mice (Smirnov et al. 2012).",

The anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrol (benzofuran coumarin) isolated from G. uralensis have been investigated at length (Shin et al. 2008). They found that glycerols have potential anti-inflammatory effect. According to Vibha et al. (2009), the steroid-like anti-inflammatory activity of liquorice root constituents is similar to the action of hydrocortisone. The explanation given by them in connection with this finding is that it occurs due to inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity, an enzyme critical to numerous inflammatory processes. The glycyrrhetinic acid (ED 50, 200 mg kg\u22121) is reported to show an inhibitory effect on carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and anti-allergic activity (Matsui et al. 2004). G. glabra secondary metabolites such as glycyrrhizic acid, glabridin, and licochalcone A also show an anti-inflammatory effect (Furuhashi et al. 2005; Kang et al. 2005).",

They used a rat model of aspirin-induced gastric mucosal damage. The results have shown that these formulations promote healing by increasing mucous production and blood supply to the damaged stomach mucosa, thus enhancing mucosal healing (Van Marle et al. 1981; Da Nagao et al. 1996). An anti-ulcerogenic effect of carbenoxolone derived from the root of liquorice too has been reported (Masoomeh and Kiarash 2007). This is explained through an inhibition of the secretion of gastrin. The reason is that liquorice compound raises the concentration of prostaglandins in the digestive system and in this way promotes mucus secretion from the stomach. Anti-pepsin effect of liquorice secondary metabolites too has been reported, which prolongs the life span of surface cells in the stomach (Adel et al. 2005).",

An inhibition of tumor formation and growth in breast, liver, and skin cancer has been reported (Liu et al. 1998; Shiota et al. 1999; Tamir et al. 2000). In 1998, Fukai and his coworkers reported the inhibitory activity of phenolic compounds such as isoliquiritigenin, semilicoisoflavone B, gancaonin C licoisoflavone B, and licoisoflavanone for the growth of both B. subtilis H17 (wild type) and M45 (recombinationless mutant cells). In in vivo assay, Sheela et al. (2006) have observed that the extract of G. glabra inhibits proliferation of tumor cells and angiogenesis. Antiproliferative effects are displayed by the ethanolic extract and glycyrrhizin against the MCF-7 in dose-dependent manner (Dong et al. 2007). Similar results have been reported by Jo et al. (2005) who used ethanol extract of G. uralensis root which induced apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The licochalcone E from the roots of G. inflata also exhibits most potent cytotoxic effect compared with the known antitumor agents, licochalcone A, and isoliquiritigenin (Yoon et al. 2005). Many compounds have been derived from G. glabra, namely, glyasperin A, gancaonin P, licochalcone B, topazolin, and gancaonin O by Nomura et al. (2002), which have shown relatively higher cytotoxic activity against human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-2. A new retrochalcone derived from the G. inflata by Yoon et al. (2005), during their studies on licochalcone E, has exhibited the potent cytotoxic effect. Isoliquiritigenin has also been reported to inhibit the proliferation of the human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell line, inducing apoptosis and locking cell cycle progression in the G1 phase (Hsu et al. 2004). Kanazawa et al. (2003) too have reported similar findings, where isoliquiritigenin has inhibited the growth of prostate cancer. It has been suggested as a chemopreventive compound for cancer in humans. In short, the biologically active compound from the liquorice root can be very useful as antiproliferative and antitumor agents (Rahman and Rashid 2008; Hossain et al. 2004).",

            "text": "The effects of these compounds (glycyrrhizin, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, 11- deoxyglycyrrhetinic acid, isoangustone A, licochalcone A, licochalcone B, licochalcone E, isoliquiritigenin, and glabridin) on different cancer types such as colon carcinogenesis, leukemia, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, human melanoma, liver cancer, bladder cancer, oral cancer, and breast cancer have been investigated by different investigators (Shetty et al. 2011; Hsu et al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2011; Chueh et al. 2012; Khan et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2013b; Song et al. 2013; Kwon et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013c; Lin et al. 2014; Huang et al. 2014a; Tsai et al. 2014; Choi et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2014). Several single compounds isolated from liquorice as well as ethanol extracts and hexane/ethanol extracts of roasted liquorice are reported to show antitumor activity (Seon et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2013c). According to Yang et al. (2015), the liquorice compounds interfere with antitumor activities mainly by attenuating the level of cytokines, blocking cell cycle progression, and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Isoangustone A has been applied to SW480 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells during in vitro studies, DU145 to human prostate cancer cells as well as 4T1 murine breast cancer cells; isoliquiritigenin to HeLa human cervical cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 to human breast cancer cells; glycyrrhizin has been applied to WEHI-3 mouse leukemia cells, glycyrrhetinic acid to DU-145 prostate cancer cells, and licochalcone to MKN-28, AGS, MKN-45 gastric cancer cells, HA22T/VGH, SK-Hep-1, HepG2 to human hepatocellular cancer cells, KB human oral cancer cells, and T24 to the bladder cancer cells (Wolkerstorfer et al. 2009; Shetty et al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2011; Chueh et al. 2012; Seon et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013c; Huang et al. 2014a; Tsai et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2014; Choi et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2014). Glycyrrhizin has also been applied under in vivo studies and has shown to inhibit 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colon precancerous lesions of Wistar rats (Khan et al. 2013), while glycyrrhetinic acid applied to gastric cancer has inhibited tumor growth in a nude mouse model (Lin et al. 2014). Glabridin has inhibited MDA-MB-231 breast cancer angiogenesis in a nude mouse model; licochalcone B has inhibited MB49 bladder tumor growth in a C57BL/6 mouse model; licochalcone E has suppressed 4T1 mammary tumor growth and lung metastasis in the mammary fat pads in a syngeneic BALB/c mouse model; isoangustone A has significantly suppressed PTEN-deleted human prostate tumor growth and SK-MEL-28 human melanoma tumor growth in xenograft mice models (Hsu et al. 2011; Kwon et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2013b; Song et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2014). In summary, liquorice embodies interesting and important hits for antitumor drug discovery and development (Yang et al. 2015).",

Many phytochemical constitutes have been found in the roots of Glycyrrhiza. These are considered as a potential source of antioxidants (Singh 2010; Lateef et al. 2012). According to Vaya et al. (1997), isoflavones glabridin and hispaglabridins A and B show significant antioxidant activity. The luteolin, rutin, and apigenin flavonoids found in the G. glabra roots show significant antioxidant characteristics (Hesham and Shgeru 2002). The main compound linked to antioxidant activity is mentioned as phenolic compounds (\u0160krov\u00e1nkov\u00e1 et al. 2012). The ethanol extract of G. glabra has been reported to possess a cerebroprotective effect in hypoxic rats, which may be mediated by its antioxidant effects (Muralidharan et al. 2009). G. glabra essential oil also exhibits DPPH radical scavenging activity (85.2%) at dose 400 \u00b5g/ml (Ali 2013), whereas methanolic extract shows 91.3% scavenging activity at dose of 62.5 \u00b5g (Lateef et al. 2012). Licochalcone C is reported to possess antioxidant because it reduces the production of superoxide radicals and consequently reduces the activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Franceschelli et al. 2011).",

(2000) for their ability to protect liver mitochondria against oxidative stresses. These workers have reported that mitochondrial lipid peroxidation linked to respiratory electron transport is induced nonenzymatically and an inhibition of these isoflavans takes place. Hispaglabridin A strongly inhibits both peroxidations and 3\u2032-hydroxy-4\u2032-O-methylglabridin, the most effective at preventing NADH-dependent peroxidation. 3\u2032-Hydroxy-4\u2032-O-methylglabridin protects the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activity against NADPH-dependent peroxidation injury (Haraguchi et al. 2000). Moreover, dihydroxyfumarate\u2014induced mitochondrial peroxidation is also prevented by this isoflavan. G. glabra isoflavans are highly effective in protecting mitochondrial function against oxidative stresses (Haraguchi et al. 2000). G. glabra root extract also shows radioprotective effect via lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes and plasmid pBR322 (Shetty et al. 2002). The extract protects microsomal membranes, which is evident from the reduction in lipid peroxidation, and could also protect plasmid DNA from radiation-induced strand breaks (Shetty et al. 2002).",

Latter also mentions that this extract significantly inhibits the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase activities, and decreases total protein, albumin, and globulin levels. The liver superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase activities are also enhanced by this extract together with glutathione level (Huo et al. 2011; Yin et al. 2011; Rasool et al. 2014; Al-Razzuqi et al. 2012). Liquorice therefore appears to be a highly potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver diseases (Yang et al. 2015). The findings of Park et al. (2016) are considered as scientific evidence that isoLQ in liquorice has the function of being a hepatic protectant against oxidative damages through ERK-mediated Nrf2 activation.",

The studies undertaken by Zhao et al.

Wang et al. (2008) too have published data related to the antidepressant-like activity of liquiritin and isoliquiritin in the forced swimming test (FST) as well as tail suspension test (TST) in mice. Latter have depicted that an increase in the 5-Hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine in the mouse hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex could be the mechanism of action of these compounds. The sedative and muscle relaxant activities in mice due to another compound in liquorice the carbenoxolone in genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs) have also been reported by Gareri et al. (2004). The studies on the root extract of G. glabra on learning and memory in another experiment has revealed that 150 and 225 mg/kg doses show an effective enhancement in learning and memory as compared to the control. The reason may be antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action of plant extract. Under these circumstances, the susceptible brain cells get exposed to less oxidative stress resulting in reduced brain damage and improved neuronal function (Chakravarthi et al. 2012).",

In addition, glycyrrhizin, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, licochalcone A, liquiritigenin, glycyrol, and glycyrrhiza polysaccharides also showed immunoregulatory activity (Abe et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2009; Li et al. 2010a, 2012; Hendricks et al. 2012; Soufy et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2013a; Ma et al. 2013; Fontes et al. 2014). The compounds isolated from liquorice exert immunoregulatory activity by regulating the production of cytokines and interleukin together with the expression of cell surface molecules and immune responses (Yang et al. 2015). Many in vivo and clinical studies have proved that these compounds produce a protective effect against disseminated candidiasis (Lee et al. 2009). It reduces the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as well (Fontes et al. 2014). It also increases the end point serum antibody titers (Hendricks et al. 2012). The production of IL-10 also increases with Con A-induced hepatitis (Abe et al. 2003). It acts as an immune stimulant against DHV (Soufy et al. 2012). All these reports affirm the immunoregulatory activity of liquorice and indicate that it can be developed as a novel immunomodulatory drug (Yang et al. 2015).",

Several compounds isolated from licorice, such as glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetinic acid, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, glabridin, licochalcone A, licochalcone E, and some other flavonoids, have been reported to possess an inhibitory effect in diabetes (Choi et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2010; Sen et al. 2011; Yehuda et al. 2011; Park et al. 2012; Alqahtani et al. 2013; Feng et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2013; Gaur et al. 2014; Yao et al. 2014). The liquorice extract can be a highly potent therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of diabetes nephropathy led by mesangial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis through blocking Akt activation and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling (Li et al. 2010b). It alleviates blood glucose levels, restores renal function, attenuates body weight loss, and modulates the adverse effect of diabetes on renal glutathione and malondialdehyde as well as the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase. It also restores the total antioxidant capacity of diabetic kidneys, and at the same time has a potential therapeutic effect in diabetes due to its antioxidant and antihyperglycemic features (Kataya et al. 2011; Saleem et al. 2011). All these reports indicate that liquorice is a highly potent therapeutic agent for diabetes treatment (Yang et al. 2015).",

It will also stimulate the secretion of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and anterior pituitary corticotroph-releasing hormone and vasopressin from the adrenal cortex (Lee et al. 2007; Kratschmar et al. 2011). Out of the compounds isolated from liquorice, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, and isoliquiritigenin produce an adrenal cortical hormone-like function (Yang et al. 2015). Isoliquiritigenin has significant estrogenic activities due to its estrogen responsive \u03b2 selectivity, partial estrogen agonist activity, and the nonenzymatic transformation between isoliquiritigenin and liquiritigenin (Hajirahimkhan et al. 2013). 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizin play a very important role in the treatment of glucocorticoid-dependent diseases as a well-known inhibitor of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (Kratschmar et al. 2011; Raikkonen et al. 2010; Sasaki et al. 2010). Glycyrrhetinic acid shows its mineralocorticoid actions by inhibiting the conjugation of deoxycorticosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone at a source within the adrenal cortex (Al-Dujaili et al. 2011). All the abovementioned findings lend support to the reasonable use of liquorice as a promising strategy for the treatment of hormone-dependent diseases (Yang et al. 2015).",

This preparation has developed four generations so far, from glycyrrhizin tablets to ammonium glycyrrhizinate, diammonium glycyrrhizinate, and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate. A comparison with its first three preparations, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate has a better lipotropy, higher targeting, and fewer adverse reactions, because of its use in protecting hepatic L02 cells from ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury (Huang et al. 2014b). It has been successfully used to slow down the process of pulmonary fibrosis (Xiao et al. 2014), inhibiting ethanol-induced testicular injury (He et al. 2010), and restoring hepatic impairments caused by paclitaxel in other cancer treatments (Chen et al. 2014a).",

Khalesi and Khatib (2011) and Khalesi (2015) have studied the relation between OTA biosynthesis and ecophysiological factors including temperature, water activity (aw), and type of mycobiota in the region at length. Recent reports demonstrate that temperature of 22 \u2103 is the critical point to control the formation of OTA in these roots; below this temperature, the amount of OTA is much lower than the temperatures mentioned. The covering of bulk of the roots during the storage needs to be avoided, as it may increase the inlet temperature and, consequently, the risk of fungal growth as well as OTA biosynthesis (Khalesi et al. 2013; Khalesi 2015).",

The distributional map of the fungi in liquorice production regions is still missing (Khalesi 2015). In all, 16 fungal species have been isolated from the root samples collected from four different locations in China, major ones being Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Eurotium (Chen et al. 2011). P. polonicum is the main species in Jiangxi province (with highest levels of OTA), whereas in other regions, Aspergillus spp. such as A. parasiticus, A. flavus, A. versicolor, and A. sydowii and Eurotium spp. such as E. chevalieri, E. repens, and E. amstelodami are dominant. Similar investigations were undertaken by Chen et al. (2013). They reported that Penicillium is the major fungus on liquorice in different regions in China with potential of OTA production. They also isolated two new Penicillium species, i.e., P. glycyrrhizacola sp. nov. and P. xingjiangense sp. nov. in the roots of this herb for the first time. P. chrysogenum was also reported as one of the main OTA producers on roots in China. Chen et al. (2013) have reported that P. chrysogenum, P. glycyrrhizacola, P. polonicum, and A. westerdijkiae are main contaminants in dry liquorice with values lying around 39.03 ng/g. However, the data for fresh and dry specimens on mycobiota differs much (Khalesi 2015).",

However, the fundamental mechanism of OTA toxicity has not been fully enlightened (Khalesi 2015). But some investigations have been done to decrease the risk by possible intake of OTA contaminated herbal product. Some research has been conducted on different food-based liquorice products as a normal dietary use to complete the current consumption databases of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concerning OTA in liquorice products (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 105/2010). According to Pietri et al. (2010), assuming a total mean value of 1.53 ng OTA/g in sweets corresponding to consumption about 1.4 g liquorice sweets per day means a weekly intake of 12 ng OTA. For an infant with 30 kg weight, a weekly uptake of 0.4 ng/kg body weight has been reported which is extremely high. In another study, it has been shown that children may consume up to 8.94% tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of liquorice confectionary (Herrera et al. 2009). Although liquorice and its derivatives are not the dominant products in dietary intake, for high consumers of this herb, especially children, yet the current amount of OTA in its products is not safe (Khalesi 2015).",

To fulfill this criterion, efforts have been made to regulate OTA levels in this herb (Commission Regulation (EU) No. 105/2010). For this purpose, first, the data of OTA concentration in a variety of its products obtained from public markets has been collected. Commission Regulation (EU) No. 105/2010 amending regulation (EC) No. 1881/2006 sets the regular maximum levels of 20 ng/g for its root and 80 ng/g for the extract. The reason for the difference between the maximum acceptable amount of OTA between root and extract is that from each 3 to 4 kg liquorice roots, around 1 kg of extract is obtained. These rules and calculations are valid for average consumers. Of course for the high consumers, patients, and infants, these amounts need to be reviewed (Khalesi 2015).",

In EU, the maximum amount of OTA in its roots and extract has been authorized at 20 and 80 ng/g, respectively. Nevertheless, a valid method to quantify this toxin is still lacking. Use of IAC and SPE clean-up methods followed by liquid chromatography has been proposed for determination of OTA in the products of this herb. However, those methods are time-consuming, laborious, costly, and restricted to only a few laboratories, mostly located in Europe. The decontamination of OTA in this herb is also a very challenging topic. Peeling, extraction, and dehydration have been reported to reduce the amount of OTA. Although thermal stability of OTA is an obstacle for heat deterioration of this mycotoxin in the roots of this herb and derived products, it seems that much more studies on determination and decontamination of OTA are needed to overcome the OTA concern in liquorice marketing (Khalesi 2015).",

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanopowder has been used as a semiconducting material. The best photovoltaic performance has been recorded from the DSSC sensitized with G. glabra after grinding the material. They suggest that this performance is significantly improved by acid treatment of the TiO2 photoelectrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the fabricated DSSCs has been carried out and charge recombination resistance, double layer capacitance, effective lifetime of electrons, charge transfer resistance, and constant phase element exponential coefficient determined (Abdel-Latif et al. 2015).",
