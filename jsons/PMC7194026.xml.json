Despite persistent predictions of system collapse, the country has \u201cfailed to fail\u201d [5]. It has experienced huge economic and industrial restructuring, changing from a poor and predominantly agrarian economy to a more diversified, higher-wage and increasingly consumption-based economy. Sustained growth of GDP, at around 10% per year between the early 1980s and early 2010s, has supported increases in welfare, including long-run increases in incomes and reductions in poverty of \u201cunprecedented \u2026 scope and scale\u201d, contributing around 70% of global reduction of the number of people in extreme poverty between 1990 and 2013 [6]. China\u2019s achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, on poverty reduction and improvements in health was a major contributing factor to their achievement globally [7]. This success has led to a belief by Chinese policy-makers and researchers that their country\u2019s experience has major lessons for others [8, 9]. It has also fostered an optimistic willingness to engage in ambitious and rapid processes of global development and change. This optimism underlies the major international initiatives we describe in section 2.",

Limited accountability and sometimes insufficient regulation (or enforcement) remain problematic, including in the health system [6].

This has led to an interest in China\u2019s management of change. Since the commencement of the transition from a command economy, government policy has been dominated by the over-riding imperatives of ensuring rapid economic development and avoiding major policy errors that could provoke social disorder. An important strategy for achieving these imperatives has been the encouragement of policy experimentation and innovation. A number of analyses have pointed to the importance of experimentation in testing novel policy solutions before large-scale adoption to learn about effectiveness and reduce the risk of unintended and deleterious outcomes [14, 15]. These approaches have helped China \u2018discover\u2019 and evolve appropriate institutions and policy approaches to underpin development [6, 16]. One example is the way that the government encouraged localities to test alternative approaches for establishing some form of rural health insurance before implementing a nation-wide reform in 2009 that included rural health insurance [1, 2]. Analysts point out functional similarities between Chinese approaches to experimentation as a component of the management of rapid change and approaches now being recommended by the global development community [4, 6].",

As Dani Rodrik has phrased the question, \u201cWe shall experiment, but how shall we learn?\u201d [22]. Historically, the Chinese polity has made use of a number of mechanisms to support intra-systemic learning, including government meeting cycles to continually review and adjust policies [23], field visits and inspections, use of policy briefings and media to disseminate practices judged to be useful and to encourage mutual learning, rotation and secondment of government officials and so forth [3]. Research institutes and universities have played a significant role in this process, helping to uncover, assess and propagate potentially significant or useful practices from among the range of practices produced at times of rapid reform. As China has established increasingly complex institutional arrangements it has begun to formalize evaluation and learning processes, leading to a growing interest in contemporary monitoring and evaluation methods [24]. In the following section we argue that China is replicating this strategy for managing adaptation to rapid change as it substantially increases its capacity to become an effective partner in global development and global health.",

We also attended a number of GHSP-supported project design meetings, workshops, and formal meetings over the course of the programme. The interviews focused on the respondents\u2019 understandings of the policy priorities, activities undertaken and the lessons that have been learned concerning China\u2019s involvement in both international development and global health and international collaborations.

In recent years, China has also made commitments to provide assistance through existing channels such as the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Chinese nationals are increasingly present in the UN system [34]. In early 2018, the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) was established, as part of a process of developing a more consolidated and institutionalised system to support a greater Chinese role in overseas assistance. Until then, aid was organized by sectoral ministries with the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) having overall responsibility. For example, the National Health Commission (NHC) has organized the deployment of medical teams to other countries, while MOFCOM has been responsible for financing the construction of health facilities, the supply of drugs and so forth. At the same time, the government has encouraged research institutes that have been deeply engaged in supporting China\u2019s internal process of rapid change, to establish think tanks to facilitate mutual learning between China and other countries.",

As can be seen from the linking of multiple kinds of activity such as assistance, research and development and commercial activity, China\u2019s role(s) is (are) unlikely to conform neatly to practices of existing donors and major global health agencies.Third, most Chinese agencies (including government and research agencies) have little experience of carrying out health interventions or collaborations overseas.

A number of networks focusing on global health are now emerging The Chinese Global Health Network, supported by the GHSP, provides a forum linking Chinese researchers, government agencies and third sector and private entities working on global health. To date there has not been a clear decision from Chinese research funding bodies regarding how China will finance research and technical support for global health. Much research continues to rely on ad hoc funding and funding from non-Chinese sources. Some new funding sources, such as the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund (SSCAF) could create opportunities for projects that will involve Chinese researchers in work on global health issues.

Chinese experts worked with partners in other countries to design and implement interventions that drew on Chinese experience. Visits by one of the authors to some pilot sites found that they provided an opportunity for several high-capacity Chinese institutions to develop interventions overseas, experiment with translating Chinese experience in new contexts and explore new kinds of assistance projects that China could support as it diversifies its health assistance. The pilots revealed many of the challenges that implementing agencies will need to address if China decides to establish its own capacity to undertake major health system strengthening and reform projects at scale. These included common problems that arise when working in another country. The signing of MOUs with multilateral organisations such as the WHO, and the establishment of new funding sources such as the SSCAF, show that the government is still exploring the appropriate balance between strengthening capacity within China to design, implement and evaluate major multi-country health system development programmes, collaborating with other bilateral agencies and working through multi-lateral organisations and global initiatives.",

One is the need to involve all relevant government departments such as International Development, Health, Commerce, Finance and Foreign Affairs. China and the UK are strengthening coordination at national level, however mechanisms to make this effective in bilateral cooperation are not firmly in place. This could be addressed by the identification of government focal points to manage bilateral cooperation on global health. A second constraint is the need to facilitate joint working between government administrative systems in China, bilateral partners and multi-lateral organizations. This will involve significant efforts by counterpart agencies involved in the funding and management of global health activities. A third constraint is the thinness of existing cooperation between China and international partners. This needs to involve health research organisations, agencies that manage international development programmes, private health sector companies and so forth. There are already examples of effective collaboration, however this needs to be deepened and mechanisms are needed for governments to mobilize this expertise in coordinated efforts to address public health challenges.

There is little doubt that there is a need for increased resources and new solutions to global health problems. The Chinese leadership is intent on greater cooperation in this area, and programmes such as the GHSP show the significance attached by other countries, UN agencies and the like to work with China as an emerging actor in development. The medium- to long-term outcomes of such collaborations and China\u2019s increasing engagement in development and health will be strongly influenced by the willingness and capacity of Chinese institutions to learn from these new experiences and adapt their policies and practices, as well as by the willingness and capacity of \u2018incumbent\u2019 agencies to adapt.",

This paper has discussed a higher-level phenomenon \u2013 approaches that are not specific to one particular technical area, but concern system-level institutions or rules that guide the ways that change is managed.",

With the increasing engagement of countries such as China in global development, the \u2018development community\u2019 will surely become more diverse, bringing a wider range of world views to bear when trying to solve problems. As development and global health debates diversify, there is increasingly a need for new forms of understanding \u2013 for Chinese development and global health professionals to understand the global system and how to engage in it, and for professionals from established donor countries, multilateral agencies and low and middle-income countries to better understand the approaches, thinking and development experiences that their new peers bring.",

The major investments funded as part of the Belt and Road Initiative are likely to strengthen and deepen regional and global connectivity, resulting in new public health challenges \u2013 and new possibilities for addressing them. The GHSP provided modest levels of support for an initial stage of learning that has principally helped inform change in China. As China\u2019s global footprint increases, there is a need for initiatives that create the learning needed by multiple partners and agencies regarding how to work together to deal with global challenges. Several programmes, including the GHSP, have started to provide evidence on how experimental initiatives can foster this kind of learning. There is now a need for initiatives and substantial investment in new approaches to learning about the management of change. Potential bilateral and multi-lateral partners will need to make a substantial effort to build their capacity to collaborate effectively with China, as China will need to build capacity to collaborate with others. It may take a lot of time and effort to agree on global decision-making processes and, meanwhile, effective responses to disease challenges could be delayed. However, the alternative would be a long-term fragmentation of public health efforts.",

This is taking place in a period of rapid change that is presenting major challenges that require global cooperation. The challenge for China, other global actors and multilateral organisations is to find ways to incorporate new approaches to global collaboration, while maintaining the stability of existing governance arrangements for global health. This will require a willingness on all sides to learn from each other and invest the effort needed to build governance arrangements appropriate for the coming decades. This is not only important as a means of protecting global public health, but also as a demonstration of how governance arrangements can be adapted to the needs of a pluralistic global order in a context of rapid change. This is the challenge the new emerging global community faces as it attempts to build a cooperative approach for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.",
