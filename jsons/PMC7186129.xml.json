According to the WHO website, until April 6, 2020, around 1,136,862 cases have been confirmed to have COVID-19 and 63,025 of them died [2]. COVID-19 is a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus and it is known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3]. The common symptoms of COVID-2019 are fever and cough [4]. The fever exists in only 43.8% of the patients on admission, however, it increases by 88.7% through hospitalization. The cough is the second common symptom and occurs in about 67.8% [3]. Other symptoms include fatigue, myalgia, and dyspnea. (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n)",

Increasing the aerobic capacity can produce immediate effects on the immune system activity. It has been shown that aerobic exercises significantly increase the function of the immune system in short periods and sometimes this increase occurs after only one session. The effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the immune functions can be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it can increase the level and function of T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes, which are essential elements in the body's defense against infections [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. Secondly, it can increase the level of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), particularly IgA because of its vital role against lung infections [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. Lastly, it can regulate the level of C-reactive proteins (CRP), through inducing a short-term small increase [[16], [17], [18]] to fight lung infections and a long\u2013term decrease to inhibit any decrease in lung functions [19,20], and lowering anxiety and depression to improve the immunity by re-balancing T-helper-1/T-helper-221\u221227.",

It can prevent or treat both pneumonia [[28], [29], [30]] and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [11,31,32], which are the common disorders develop with COVID-19 and lead to a respiratory system failure. The effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving lung functions and preventing lung damage can be summarized into four mechanisms. The first mechanism includes the role of increasing the aerobic capacity as antibiotic and antimycotic prophylaxis to improve lung and body immunity [30]. The second mechanism includes the role of increasing the aerobic capacity on restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and increasing respiratory muscles strength and endurance, which help in increasing the ventilation, lung mechanics and decreasing lung damage [[33], [34], [35], [36]]. The third mechanism includes the role of increasing the aerobic capacity as an antioxidant to limit free radicals production and oxidative damage [37]. The fourth mechanism includes the role of increasing the aerobic capacity on decreasing the cough and clear respiratory airways through both improving the lung immunity [38] and producing an autonomic modulation [39,40]. The role of increasing the aerobic capacity on pulmonary functions and immunity is more important than breathing exercises and can accomplish more improvements in cough mechanism [36,41].",

Increasing the aerobic capacity can be also used as an adjacent treatment to decrease hospitalization, which sometimes forces the medical staff to choose between treating some patients and leaving others to die. This review consists of three subtitles, the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the immune system functions, the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving respiratory system functions and preventing its illnesses in patients with COVID-19, and the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity as a protective barrier against the occurrence of COVID-19.",

Among all immune cells, T-lymphocytes play major antiviral roles against pathogens [50]. CD4+ T-lymphocytes increase the secretion of virus\u2010specific antibodies by stimulating T\u2010dependent B-cells. Besides, T-lymphocytes can survive in the infected lungs and destroy the infecting viruses [52], this highlights the important role of T-lymphocytes in controlling the pathogenesis of coronaviruses infection. It has been shown that the response of cross\u2010reactive T-lymphocytes is vital for the reduction in amounts of MERS\u2010CoV [53]. The depletion of T-lymphocytes usually causes a decrease in the pulmonary recruitment of T-lymphocytes, neutralizing antibody, and cytokine production. This can cause a severe immune\u2010mediated interstitial pneumonitis and late clearance of SARS\u2010CoV from lungs [54]. Moreover, T-helper cells stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through stimulating the NF\u2010kB signaling pathway [55]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate the release and migration of monocytes and neutrophils to the location of infection to activate other downstream cytokine and chemokine cascades, including IL\u201021, IL-10, IL\u20106, IL\u20101, IL\u20108, MCP\u20101, and TNF\u2010\u03b2 [56,57]. MERS\u2010CoVs can produce T-lymphocytes apoptosis by triggering the extrinsic and intrinsic and apoptosis pathways [58]. In the later stages of the lung infection, the diminution of T-lymphocytes could increase the period of infection and promote viral survival [59].",

Lippi et al. [7,8] have demonstrated that mid-distance running (21.1 km) increases the production of neutrophil, leukocyte, and monocyte amounts in unprofessional runners. Lira et al. [10] have shown that after just 60-min of 5-km running, an increase in cytokine IL-6 and IL-10 occurs. Li et al. [9] have demonstrated that a single session of prolonged aerobic exercises can increase the number of circulating leukocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte for up to 9 h. A more related study conducted by Gon\u00e7alves et al. [11], they investigated the protective short-term effect of aerobic exercises on artificially-induced acute lung injuries in mice. They found that performing low aerobic exercises for only 5-weeks produced a significant increase in the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and tissue, pulmonary elasticity and resistance, TNF-alpha in lung tissue, protein leakage, plasma levels of IL-10 and IL-6, and IL-1beta, IL-6 and KC levels.",

Although the main aims of these studies were to study the effect of aerobic exercises on the complement activity to examine the role of overtraining syndrome in diminishing the immune response. In these studies, there were high contradictions in their results. Smith et al. [67] conducted a study to investigate the short-term effects of aerobic exercises on the complement activity in runners. They found that short-term aerobic exercises produced stimulation of C3 and C4 and consequent generation of C3a and C4a anaphylatoxins. They suggested that stimulation of the classical pathway of complement and selective downregulation of C3 production might be found in individuals commonly involved in mild aerobic exercises as runners. Karacabey et al. [68,69] investigated the effect of aerobic exercises on the humoral activity in professional athletes and sportswomen. They found that C3 and C4 levels suppressed immediately after aerobic exercises as compared to the pre-exercise results, while these values returned to be non-significant as compared to pre-exercise values after only 4 h. Wolach et al. [70] examined the effect of aerobic exercises on complement activity in young-female gymnasts. They found high contradictions in the results of complement components (C1Q, C1R, C1S, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, CA, and C9). These high contradictions might be raised because athletes usually participate in high strenuous and repeated activities, which can lead to adverse effects (overtraining syndrome) [71].",

Pentraxins play chief roles in inflammatory processes and body reactions to viral infections by stimulating the complement pathway, phagocytosis, apoptosis, nitric oxide secretion, and cytokines production [72]. Increasing CRP levels is a body defense mechanism against viral infections, however, persistent high CRP levels can significantly speed up lung damage because high CRP levels cause consequent drops in lung functions [73]. One of the main lab tests to discover COVID-19 is serum CRP. Patients with COVID-19 have very high levels of CRP [1,74]. Increasing the aerobic capacity plays an interesting role in regulating the CRP levels by producing a short-term small increase in CRP levels [[16], [17], [18]] to fight lung infections and a long-term decrease in CRP levels [19,20] to prevent the decrease in lung functions.",

Stress might decrease immunity by altering the balance between immune cells, such as altering the balance between T-helper-1/T-helper-2. Stress can cause this alteration through its effect on increasing the amounts of serum corticosteroids and catecholamines hormones, thus a decrease in the immunity response might occur [21].",

[83], reported that infected patients might show proteinaceous exudate, edema, focal reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes with sporadic inflammatory cellular infiltration, and multi-nucleated giant cells. Also, some differences were detected between these patients, as a reactive alveolar epithelial hyperplasia and fibroblastic proliferation (fibroblast plugs). The most common pulmonary disorders in patients with COVID-19 are pneumonia and ARDS, and they are considered life-threatening disorders and need immediate interventions [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Also, the earliest and commonest signs in patients with COVID-19 are dry cough and dyspnea [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Increasing the aerobic capacity can significantly help in preventing and treating pulmonary infections and pathological conditions [89]. The effects of aerobic exercises in pulmonary infections are more preferable than breathing exercises because of their associated immune and autonomic modulations [36,41].",

A very recent study conducted by Shi et al. [32] has shown that 5- weeks of mild aerobic exercises can prevent acute lung injury in mice by producing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) inhibition, which plays a vital role in acute lung injury. NETs are secreted by stimulated neutrophils and consist mainly of histones, DNA, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophil elastase (NE). The extracellular web-like structures can efficiently trap attacking pathogens and use highly local concentrations of anti-microbial peptides to destroy virulence components.",

It was previously mentioned in the section of \u201cthe effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the immune system functions\u201d that increasing the aerobic capacity increases the respiratory and body immunity through a) increasing the level and function of T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes which are essential elements in the body's defense against infections, b) increasing the level of immunoglobulins \u201cIgA, IgM, IgG\u201d, particularly IgA because of its vital role in lung infections, C) regulating C-reactive protein levels, through producing a short-term small increase to fight lung viruses and a long\u2013term decrease to prevent the drop in lung functions, and d) decreasing the anxiety and depression which helps to rebalance T-helper-1/T-helper-2 and improve the immunity.",

They found that aerobic exercises restored normal lung mechanics and flow acceleration rate through decreasing lung hyperinflation, and restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Park and Han [92] examined the effect of aerobic exercises on the maximum-expiratory lung capacity of older women. They found that 20-min of mild aerobic exercises for 12 weeks improved alveoli function and increased lung elasticity. Taskin et al. [93] studied the effect of aerobic exercises on the strength of respiratory muscles in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

Free radicals, like reactive oxygen species (ROS), are produced throughout the usual cellular function and are considered a part of normal physiological processes of all living animals. Free radicals have both beneficial and toxic effects. When levels of free radicals incredibly increase and cannot gradually be handled, they accumulate in the body creating a phenomenon called \u201coxidative stress\u201d [94]. Commonly, oxidative stress is considered the initial point for the onset of several diseases, among them lung infections and diseases [94,95].

Increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease cough mainly through autonomic modulation more than mucociliary clearance [39,40]. Borghi-Silva et al. [40] examined the effect of 6-weeks of mild aerobic exercises on autonomic modulation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They found that aerobic exercises produced a decrease in respiratory rate and an increase in the tidal volume during exercise and these changes decreased in the heart rate [40,98]. Recently, Leite et al. [39] conducted a study to investigate the effect of 12-weeks of mild aerobic exercises on the autonomic nervous system and cough in patients with COPD. They found that mild aerobic exercises decreased cough and heart rate. The effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on decreasing the heart rate could be beneficial in decreasing dyspnea found in patients with COVID-1940. Thus, mild aerobic exercises could produce more significant effects on decreasing both cough and dyspnea, commonly seen in patients with COVID-19, than breathing exercises because they affect more the parasympathetic system causing a central decrease in these two symptoms.",

Increasing the aerobic capacity can produce short-term improvements in heart problems. The short-term improvements in heart volumes and rates were discussed in the previous paragraph [37,46,47]. Other animal studies have revealed that mild aerobic exercises produce significant improvements in heart functions. Tao et al. [48] examined the effect of mild aerobic exercises on preventing acute myocardial infarction in mice. They found that 3-weeks of mild aerobic exercises protected mice from acute myocardial infarction through improving myocardium energy metabolism and producing early adaptive alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis. Wisl\u00f8ff et al. [49] investigated the short-term effects of aerobic exercises on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac muscle contractility, and Ca2+ sensitivity in mice after myocardial infarction. They found that 8-weeks of moderate aerobic exercises decreased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased both cardiac contractility and Ca2+ sensitivity.",
