Statistical significance was declared using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Absence of multicollinearity was checked and found to be satisfied with the maximum variance inflation factor (VIF) value of 1.8. Goodness of fit was checked by Hosmer-Lemeshow test which yielded a chi-square value of 1.4 with 8 df and p-value of 0.99 for the final model of overall HIV positivity.",
