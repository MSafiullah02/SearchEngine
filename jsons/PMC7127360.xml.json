In North Eastern states of India, it is used as a garnish over ethnic side dishes and leaf salad to lower the blood sugar level. Leaf juices were also known to treat cholera, dysentery, anemia, and purification of blood (Laloo and Hemalatha, 2011). During the growing season, the stem and leaves are harvested and used for preparing a decoction. Traditionally the decoction is used both internally and externally. Internally it is good for the treatment of many ailments including cancer, coughs, dysentery, enteritis and fever and externally it is applied to treat snake bites and skin diseases (Vent, 1987). In Japan, a beverage made from an infusion of the leaves of HC herbs called Dokudami Cha mixed in with other herbal remedies were being used for removing free radicals, reducing inflammation and supporting the immune system.",

The histamine released from de-granulated mast cells and changes in intercellular Ca+ are the main factors behind such acute anaphylactic reactions. In a study Li et. al., investigated the anti-allergic activity of HCWE against both systemic and acute anaphylactic reactions in rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC). The HCWE (0, 2.5, 25, or 250 \u03bcg/ml) has shown to inhibit the histamine release and Ca+ uptake in a dose-dependent manner (Li et al., 2005). The possible mechanism of inhibition of histamine release and lower Ca+ uptake was thought to be due to increase in adenylate cyclase activity and subsequent increase in intracellular cAMP level in mast cells. The IgE mediated allergic reactions were also found to play important role in inflammatory pathophysiology. The human basophilic cell expresses a high-affinity IgR receptor known as Fc epsilon RI receptor that can potentially activate allergic reactions. In a study, Shim et al. showed that the HC water extract reduced the IgE binding activity and m RNA expression of both \u03b1- and \u03b3- chains of Fc epsilon RI receptor in human KU812F cells. Furthermore, the HC extract was also shown to reduce the Fc epsilon RI mediated histamine release in KU812F cells (Shim et al., 2009). In a yet another study, Han et al. provided evidence of the anti-inflammatory role of HC water extract against IgE mediated allergic response in rat mast RBL-2H3 cells. The HC water extract was shown to suppress the DNP-BSA mediated release of beta-hexosaminidase, histamine, ROS, TNF- \u03b1 and IL-6 in IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. Moreover, it suppressed DNP-BSA-induced phosphorylation of Syk, Lyn, LAT, Gab2, PLC \u03b32, Akt and MAP kinases (Han et al., 2009).",

Firstly, the routes of entry of HC constituents into the cell will be of utmost importance, in order to understand the basic characteristics of the drug molecules interact with the cellular membrane. Secondly, in order to validate the possibility of the molecules of HC as a drug, further studies on its ability to cross blood brain barrier, skin permeability, lipophilicity as well as its pharmacodynamics properties will be useful. Thirdly, the role of HC extract/active molecules in calcium signaling is yet to be studied. Though a few studies have shown HC to inhibit the calcium uptake, still its role has to identify in order to comprehend information on its effect in cAMP/calcium signaling. Recent studies on inflammation have opened up the area of NLRP3 signaling. NLRP3 is found to be predominantly expressed in macrophages and is a component of inflammasome complex. Thus fourthly, elucidation of HC role in NLRP3 inflammasome is needed to understand its anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, studies concerning the role played by HC in GSK3\u03b2 signaling will be required in order to understand its role in oxidative stress-induced diseases. Thus due to its less toxic nature and having both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, HC may find its utility as a lead plant to treat inflammatory and oxidative stress-related diseases in near future.",
