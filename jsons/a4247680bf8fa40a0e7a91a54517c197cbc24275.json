Bacterial bloodstream infection is the most commonly diagnosed cause of febrile neutropenia, with Gram-positive organisms most frequently isolated. However, Gram-negative organisms are becoming more prevalent, with a worrying trend towards resistant organisms. When FN is prolonged, lasting for more than 5 days, there is an increased risk of invasive fungal infections. Prompt recognition, diagnosis and initiation of treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential to avoid complications and prevent rapid progression to sepsis and possible death. This short article summarises the definition, causes, pathogenesis, applied physiology and management of FN in children.",

The United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) defines FN as a temperature !38 C with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500 cells/microlitre (less than 0.5 x 10 9 /L). This neutrophil cut-off was chosen because the risk of overwhelming sepsis increases as the ANC drops below 0.5 x 10 9 /L. Several guidelines propose more complex definitions, for example a single fever of !38.3 C; a temperature of !38 C for more than one hour; or two episodes of fever of more than 38 C within a 12 h period. The ANC cut-off can also vary between 1.0 x 10 9 /L and 0.1 x 10 9 /L. Prolonged FN is neutropenia with co-existent fever lasting for more than five days, which increases the risk of invasive fungal infections.",

Equally, febrile and systemically unwell cancer patients with a normal ANC should also be treated for serious infection because of possible qualitative immunosuppression.

Anaemia and thrombocytopenia can be corrected with transfusion, but neutropenia in particular poses a significant danger to the patient. Neutrophils form the body's major defence against infection, particularly bacterial and fungal infection. Neutrophils phagocytose microbes and eradicate them via several methods, including production of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogen-containing vacuole; fusion of neutrophil granules containing various antimicrobial mediators to the vacuole; and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Neutrophils also assist in generating fevers by releasing endogenous pyrogens in response to infection, but in the absence of neutrophils, epithelial cells can release cytokines which cause fever.",

Beta-lactam antibiotics, e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam, are recommended by NICE as first line monotherapy unless there are previous microbiological results which indicate a resistant organism. The dosage of piperacillin-tazobactam (dosed according to piperacillin component) is 90mg/kg/dose every 6 h (max per dose 4.5g).",

CXR may not show changes if the patient is profoundly neutropenic and should be interpreted with caution. If no pathological changes are seen on CXR despite respiratory symptoms then a CT chest should be considered. Abdominal ultrasound can be considered after 72 h of fever, to assess whether there is fungal involvement of the kidney and/or liverOther testsPerform a urine dipstick and urine culture in all children under the age of 5 years. Older children should have a urine sample taken if the history or examination reveals localising symptoms or underlying urinary tract abnormalities. It is important to bear in mind that neutropenic patients may not have pyuria, therefore dipstick testing or microscopy should not be used to determine whether or not to send urine samples for culture or treat empirically.",
