Glycyrrhiza glabra is one of the most popular medicinal plants belonging to the Fabaceae family (also known as Leguminosae), and its members are now commonly used as feed and food. The genus Glycyrrhiza is derived from the Greek words glykos (sweet) and rhiza (root). It is also called licorice, liquorice, glycyrrhiza, sweet wood, and Liquiritiae radix (in English); s\u00fcssholz and lakritzenwurzel (in German); reglisse and bios doux (in French); shirin bayan and mak (in Persian); and liquirizia and regaliz (in Italian and Spanish, respectively). This species is a native of Mediterranean areas, but it is now also present in India, Russia, and China. The extracts are currently used in pharmaceutical and food industries, as well as in the manufacture of functional foods and food supplements (Hayashi & Sudo, 2009; Herrera, Herrera, & Ari\u00f1o, 2009).",

            "text": "The use of liquorice predates the Greek and Roman empires, having a long history of traditional medicines and folk remedies. In fact, different geographical areas and periods are linked to different uses (Armanini, Fiore, Mattarello, Bielenberg, & Palermo, 2002). The first documents can be traced back to ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian cultures. Theophrastus and Pedanius Dioscorides wrote about liquorice as a medicinal plant and described its therapeutic effects (Armanini et al., 2002). In traditional Chinese medicine, for example, the plant is recommended as a common remedy for gastrointestinal problems, cough, bronchitis, and arthritis. In particular, it is still widely used to treat gastritis, peptic ulcers, respiratory infections, and tremors in folk medicine. Commonly, G. glabra root is employed to prepare a tea that is an excellent thirst quencher. The dried root has been described as a tooth cleanser (Armanini et al., 2002). Actually, the most important industrial use of G. glabra is the production of food additives, such as flavours and sweetening agents (Mukhopadhyay & Panja, 2008). In particular, the root is used as a flavouring agent for American\u2010type tobacco, chewing gum, candies, baked goods, ice cream, and soft drinks (Rizzato, Scalabrin, Radaelli, Capodaglio, & Piccolo, 2017). In beers and fire extinguishers, the root extracts are used as foaming agents, whereas the root fibbers are used in insulation, wallboard, and boxboard materials, after removal of the medicinal and flavouring constituents. In the cosmetic field, G. glabra is described as a skin depigmentation agent and is being incorporated in topical products for that purpose.",

Like the other plants of Fabaceae, G. glabra is able to fix nitrogen, due to symbiosis with bacteria of the genus Rhizobium, at the root level, being suitable for sandy and clay soils, though preferring humid soils. Since the Egyptian age, the therapeutic properties of G. glabra are well documented (Fiore et al., 2005). The roots are the most used parts whereas leaves are considered an agrochemical waste. However, in the last years, different authors studied the phytochemical composition of G. glabra leaves, demonstrating that certain compounds present in the roots are also identified in leaves, although in smaller quantities (Hayashi & Sudo, 2009; Siracusa et al., 2011).",

Nevertheless, few studies were carried out on the nutritional composition of G. glabra. Nutritionally, liquorice is a source of proteins, amino acids, polysaccharides and simple sugars, mineral salts (such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, iron, magnesium, silicon, selenium, manganese, zinc, and copper), pectins, resins, starches, sterols, and gums (Q. Wang et al., 2015). Oestrogens, tannins, phytosterols (sitosterol and stigmasterol), coumarins, vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, E, and C), and glycosides have been reported (Q. Wang, Qian, et al., 2015). A large number of biological compounds have also been isolated, mostly triterpenes, saponins (responsible for the sweet taste), and flavonoids (Rizzato et al., 2017; Q. Wang, Qian, et al., 2015). The liquorice saponins are present as glucuronides, whereas the aglycones are present as oleananes. The triterpene saponins are the major characteristic constituents of liquorice, being responsible for the sweet taste. The contents of these compounds may vary significantly due to geographic sources, harvesting, and processing, affecting the therapeutic effects of liquorice.",

            "text": "The yellow colour of liquorice is due to the flavonoid content. The flavonoids identified belong to different classes, including flavanones, flavones, flavanonols, chalcones, isoflavans, isoflavenes, isoflavones, and isoflavanones. The major flavonoids are glycosides of liquiritigenin (4\u2032,7\u2010dihydroxyflavanone) and isoliquiritigenin (2\u2032,4,4\u2032\u2010trihydroxychalcone), such as liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritin apioside, and licuraside (Rizzato et al., 2017). Five new flavonoids have been isolated from dried roots: glucoliquiritin apioside, shinflavanone, shinpterocarpin, prenyllicoflavone A, and 1\u2010methoxyphaseolin. Pinocembrin and licoflavanone were also isolated from the leaves (Fukui, Goto, & Tabata, 1988). Glabridin is the principal isoflavone identified, ranging between 0.08% and 0.35% of roots' dry weight (Simmler, Pauli, & Chen, 2013). The minor phenolic compounds are isoprenoid\u2010substituted flavonoids, chromenes, coumarins, dihydrostilbenes, coumestans, benzofurans, and dihydrophenanthrenes. Furthermore, many volatile components are present in roots, such as geraniol, pentanol, hexanol, terpinen\u20104\u2010ol, and \u03b1\u2010terpineol, conferring the characteristic odour. The essential oil obtained from G. glabra is also rich in propionic acid, benzoic acid, furfuraldehyde, 2,3\u2010butanediol, furfuryl formate, maltol, 1\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010formylpyrrole, and trimethylpyrazine (Chouitah, Meddah, Aoues, & Sonnet, 2011).

            "text": "The antioxidant activity of G. glabra is one of the major reasons for its uses. The phenolic content is probably responsible for the powerful antioxidant activity observed (Rackova et al., 2007). Varsha and Sonam (2013) attributed this activity to flavonoids, whereas Singh et al. (2015) reported that mostly isoflavones, such as glabridin, hispaglabridin A, and 30\u2010hydroxy\u20104\u2010O\u2010methylglabridin, are the responsible compounds. Biondi, Rocco, and Ruberto (2003) reported a huge antioxidant activity of the dihydrostilbene derivates present in G. glabra leaves. Also, licochalcones B and D are present in G. glabra, showing a strong scavenging activity on DPPH radical and the ability to inhibit the microsomal lipid peroxidation (Biondi et al., 2003; V. Sharma, Katiyar, & Agrawal, 2016). These phenolic compounds are effective in the protection of biological systems against oxidative stress, being able to inhibit the onset of skin damages (Haraguchi et al., 1998). According to Castangia et al. (2015), the topical application of liquorice extract formulations may be of value in innovative dermal and cosmetic products as it counteracts oxidative stress damage, maintaining the skin homeostasis due to its high antioxidant content. Table 1 summarizes the most important studies of antioxidant activity.",

Yang, Yuan, Ma, Zhou, & Liu, 2017). Shalaby, Ibrahim, Mahmoud, and Mahmoud (2004) evaluated the anti\u2010inflammatory activity of G. glabra in male rats after 4 weeks of food intake. The authors observed a significant decrease in the total cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as in the levels of serum liver enzymes. Harwansh, Patra, Pareta, Singh, and Biswas (2011) reviewed the positive effects of G. glabra on the treatment of the upper respiratory tract and gastric system diseases. These pharmacological effects were due to an increase in the secretion of serotonin and prostaglandins in the stomach that led to a decrease of gastric inflammation (Bahmani et al., 2014). Different authors described that the anti\u2010inflammatory action is primary mediated by glycyrrhizin, which in vitro could inhibit factors responsible for inflammation as well as promote the healing of stomach and mouth ulcers (Rackova et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2017). In fact, the anti\u2010inflammatory effects of glycyrrhizin were described as similar to those of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (Kageyama, Suzuki, & Saruta, 1994). Furthermore, G. glabra is used in renal and liver complications on the basis of its strong anti\u2010inflammatory effects (Y. Xiao et al., 2010). Y. Xiao et al. (2010) reported the inhibition of liver granuloma formation and the inflammatory cytokine production by glycyrrhizin, whereas X. R. Wang, Hao, and Chu (2017) described the anti\u2010inflammatory effects on endometriosis. Moreover, Liu et al. (2017) proved the anti\u2010inflammatory activity of glabridin on RAW cells.",

These effects are associated with the presence of glycyrrhizin that helps to expel congestion in the upper respiratory tract and accelerates tracheal mucus secretion (V. Sharma et al., 2016). Likewise, liquiritin apioside, an active compound reported in the methanolic extract of liquorice, has the ability to inhibit capsaicin, a compound that induces cough (Kamei, Nakamura, Ichiki, & Kubo, 2003). The effect on sore throat has been compared with that of carbenoxolone, a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative with a steroid\u2010like structure, which stimulates gastric mucus secretion (Damle, 2014).",

            "text": "The use of G. glabra extract as antiulcerative is widely known. For the gastrointestinal system, it is used in gastric and duodenal ulcers (Bardhan, Cumberland, Dixon, & Holdsworth, 1978), whereas for the treatment of spasmodic pains of chronic gastritis, it is employed as an adjuvant (Armanini et al., 2002). The benefits of G. glabra in the treatment of duodenal and peptic ulcers have been reported since the 1970s, and this traditional use is related to the presence of anti\u2010inflammatory saponins (Krausse et al., 2004). The major compound responsible for this activity is glycyrrhizin, which can raise the concentration of prostaglandins in the digestive tract, promoting stomach mucus secretion (Jafarian & Ghazvini, 2007). In addition, liquorice prolongs the lifespan of stomach surface cells, demonstrating an antipepsin effect (Ram, Lachake, Kaushik, & Shreedhara, 2010). Furthermore, deglycyrrhizinated liquorice has shown some effects in the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers, suggesting the presence of other active ingredients (Zadeh, Kor, & Goftar, 2013). Indeed, carbenoxolone, a glycyrrhetinic acid analogue, is reported to inhibit two important enzymes for the metabolism of prostaglandin, 15\u2010hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and \u039413 prostaglandin reductase, raising prostaglandin levels and leading to positive effects in clinical trials for gastric and duodenal ulcers (Damle, 2014). In fact, prostaglandins stimulate mucous secretion and cell proliferation leading to ulcer healing. Nevertheless, the glycyrrhetic acid derivative carbenoxolone presents secondary effects such as the potential development of pseudo aldosteronism, which limits its use. In a clinical trial, Bardhan et al. (1978) studied the effect of liquorice by oral administration in 96 patients with gastric ulcer. The patients were randomly allocated to the treatment either with deglycyrrhizinated liquorice or with placebo. However, after 4 weeks, no differences were observed between groups in the percentage of ulcer area reduction or clinical improvements (Bardhan et al., 1978).",

Different authors reported the antimicrobial properties of G. glabra, particularly on Gram\u2010positive and Gram\u2010negative bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Bacillus subtilis (Gupta et al., 2008; L. Wang, Yang, Yuan, Liu, & Liu, 2015). The antibacterial activity observed is due to the presence of secondary metabolites, namely, saponins, alkaloids, and flavonoids (Fukui et al., 1988; L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015). In particular, glabridin, glabrol, glabrene, hispaglabridin A, hispaglabridin B, 40\u2010methylglabridin, and 3\u2010hydroxyglabrol, isolated from G. glabra, are responsible for this activity (L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015). The mechanism behind this could be the decrease of bacterial gene expression, the inhibition of bacterial growth, and the reduction of bacterial toxin production (Gupta et al., 2008; L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015). In 2014, S.\u2010J. Ahn, Song, Mah, Cho, and Kook (2014) demonstrated that liquorice prevents bacterial caries caused by Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. Likewise, in vitro studies proved that aqueous and ethanolic extracts of liquorice have an inhibitory activity on Streptococcus pyogenes (Fukai et al., 2002a, 2002b; L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015). On the other hand, the ability to inactivate methicillin\u2010resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by decreasing the expression of SaeR and Hla, the key virulence genes of MRSA, have also been reported by different authors (Fukai et al., 2002a, 2002b; L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015). It is also suggested that licochalcone E could be used for chemical synthesis of novel anti\u2010S. aureus compounds, reducing the production of \u03b1\u2010toxin in both methicillin\u2010sensitive S. aureus and MRSA (L.

Also, they can enhance host cell activities by blocking the degradation of I\u03baB enzyme involved in the propagation of the cellular response to inflammation, activating T lymphocyte proliferation, and suppressing host cell apoptosis (L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015). The antiviral mechanisms of both compounds are similar, inhibiting the adsorption and penetration of the virus in the early steps of the replicative cycle. Nevertheless, Cinatl et al. (2003) reported that these active principles are less effective if added during the adsorption period than after virus adsorption. On the other hand, Soufy et al. (2012) found that glycyrrhizin has excellent immunostimulant properties and induces a synergistic effect with duck hepatitis virus (DHV) vaccine by activating T lymphocyte proliferation. Thus, the treatment with glycyrrhizin alone or in combination with DHV vaccine could lead to an immune stimulation and antiviral effect against DHV (Soufy et al., 2012).",

Glycyrrhizin stimulates the mouse defence system against HSV\u20101 infection (Sekizawa, Yanagi, & Itoyama, 2001). Furthermore, glycyrrhizic acid was found to have a distinctive effect against Kaposi sarcoma\u2010associated herpes virus (KSHV). It was proved that glycyrrhizic acid could terminate the latent infection of KSHV when all current drugs are ineffective (Damle, 2014). Also, glycyrrhizic acid down\u2010regulates the expression of latency\u2010associated nuclear antigen in B lymphocytes leading to natural cell death (apoptosis) of the KSHV\u2010infected cells (Damle, 2014). Recently, the antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin against severe acute respiratory syndrome virus was evaluated (Cinatl et al., 2003). Glycyrrhizin affects the cellular signalling pathways such as protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and transcription factors, namely, activator protein 1 and nuclear factor \u03baB (Cinatl et al., 2003).

This activity is due to the 18\u03b2\u2010glycyrrhetinic and glycyrrhizic acids that induce mitochondrial permeability transition, leading to the apoptosis of tumour cells (C. S. Lee et al., 2008). C. S. Lee et al. (2008) demonstrated the toxic effect of G. glabra against the human cervix and uterus tumour cell line SiHa cells. Ohtsuki et al.

Sharma, Agrawal, & Shrivastava, 2014). Glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acids are effective compounds in gastric cancer treatment, whereas glycyrrhizin suppresses thromboxane A2 in lung cancer cell with low toxicity (Deng, Wang, Zeng, Chen, & Huang, 2017).

Chakravarthi and Avadhani (2013) and Dhingra and Sharma (2006) studied the effects of G. glabra root aqueous extract on the learning and memory of 1\u2010month\u2010old male Wistar albino mice at doses between 75 and 300 mg/kg, orally administered during six successive weeks. Both studies demonstrated a significant improvement of learning and memory in mice, but the exact mechanism behind this action remains unknown (Chakravarthi & Avadhani, 2013; Dhingra & Sharma, 2006). These findings suggest a possible neuroprotective role of liquorice in the prevention of diseases such as Alzheimer. The basis of Alzheimer is the chronic inflammation of certain brain regions. Thus, the anti\u2010inflammatory activity of liquorice might contribute to the observed memory\u2010enhancing effects (Yokota, Nishio, Kubota, & Mizoguchi, 1998). Also, oxygen free radicals are implicated in the process of aging and could be responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease in elderly persons. The protective role of liquorice extract may be attributed to its antioxidant properties, resulting in reduced brain damage and improvement of neuronal function and memory. The combination of anti\u2010inflammatory and antioxidant activities with neuroprotective role could lead to memory\u2010enhancing effects. Hasanein (2011) investigated the effect of chronic treatment with glabridin on the cognitive function of diabetic rats. The results showed an improvement of learning and memory in nondiabetic rats and a reversal of learning and memory deficits in diabetic rats.

Glabridin potentiation is not sensitive to flumazenil and uses a similar mechanism of the general anaesthetics involving the amino acids N265 and M286, which are located in the second and third transmembrane domains on the \u03b2\u2010subunit of GABAA receptors (Hanrahan, Chebib, & Johnston, 2011).

Recent studies have shown that liquorice extract produces significant antidepressant effects in mice during forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST; Dhingra & Sharma, 2006). In the FST model, mice were forced to swim in a restricted space and induced to a characteristic behaviour of immobility. This situation reflects a state of depression. The TST model also induces a state of immobility that is claimed to reproduce a condition similar to human depression. Both models are widely used to screen antidepressant drugs. The precise mechanisms by which liquorice extract produced this effect are not completely understood. However, it is suggested that the extract may interact with \u03b11\u2010adrenoceptors and dopamine D2 receptors, increasing the levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the mice brain (Dhingra & Sharma, 2006). Besides, p\u2010CPA (a serotonin synthesis inhibitor) did not attenuate the antidepressant effect of liquorice extract, suggesting that this is not mediated by the serotonergic system. On the other hand, p\u2010CPA reversed the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine, suggesting that fluoxetine acts in the serotonergic system. Reserpine produces a significant depression by depleting biogenic amines in the brain of rodents. As liquorice extract reversed reserpine\u2010induced depression, its antidepressant effect can be associated with the restoration of brain monoamines, such as norepinephrine and dopamine.",

This disease occurs through occlusion or blockage of coronary arteries, resulting in myocardial cell death. However, the reperfusion produces the salvage of ischaemic tissue but also contributes to the myocardial cellular injury. The pretreatment with G. glabra significantly attenuates the ischaemic reperfusion, through an improvement of the heart antioxidant status, a positive modulation of the perturbed haemodynamic, and a recovery of left ventricular contractile function, along with histological salvage (Di Paola et al., 2009; Ojha, Golechha, Kumari, Bhatia, & Arya, 2013). In particular, glycyrrhizic acid induced protection against myocardial ischaemia in rats, probably due to its antioxidant potential (Ojha et al., 2013).

Glycyrrhetic acid and liquorice saponins can inhibit 11\u2010\u03b2\u2010hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, leading to a cortisol\u2010induced mineralocorticoid effect and a consequent tendency to the elevation of sodium and reduction of potassium levels (Isbrucker & Burdock, 2006). For example, in 2010, a 34\u2010year\u2010old woman was suspected to have suffered a lethal acute intoxication from eating liquorice over a period of several months (Albermann et al., 2010). Albermann et al. associated the effects with the potential mineralocorticoid action of glycyrrhizin and its metabolite, glycyrrhetic acid, and quantified by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry these compounds in the blood. Nevertheless, only traces of glycyrrhetic acid had been found in the blood and stomach content of the deceased woman, which means that the possibility of acute lethal glycyrrhetic acid intoxication could be eliminated (Albermann et al., 2010).",

In addition to hypertension, patients may experience hypokalaemia and sodium retention, resulting in oedema. Studies on rodents and humans demonstrated that glycyrrhizin is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract but extensively metabolized by the intestinal microflora to glycyrrhetic acid and monoglucuronyl glycyrrhetic acid, which are both readily absorbed. Thus, an enterohepatic circulation of glycyrrhetic acid can occur, requiring several days for complete body elimination (Koga, Kawamura, Iwase, & Yoshikawa, 2013).

This plant has been broadly used as a traditional medicine and food industry ingredient, particularly as a flavour and sweetening agent. The roots are used in the prevention and treatment of several complications, especially microbial/viral infection, cancer, and skin inflammation. Among the bioactive compounds, flavonoids are the most important, being responsible for most of the biological activities. Different phytochemicals, including glycyrrhizin, 18\u03b2\u2010glycyrrhetinic acid, glabrin A and B, or isoflavones, have been identified and associated with the biological activities reported, namely, antioxidant, antiviral, antimicrobial, anticancer, or anti\u2010inflammatory activities as well as hepatoprotection. These activities generally agree with traditional knowledge and folk medicine. Indeed, the side effects and toxicity associated with liquorice are few and are mainly linked with hypertension and fluid retention. Regarding this particular thematic, to date, few studies have been conducted, aside from some isolated ones. Thus, side effects remain an area of potential future study. This review not only details and explains the traditional use of this plant but also highlights its potential uses for other industries, such as cosmetic or pharmaceutical ones. More clinical trials should be performed to provide scientific basis for new uses.",
