Recognition of clinical features at an earlier stage of the infection and stringent isolation procedures could prevent outbreaks in institutions, but the presentation of SARS may be less florid in older people. 2 Nursing home residents, because of their frailty and comorbidities, are frequent users of hospital services, including emergency rooms (ERs) and acute wards, thus increasing their risk of exposure to infectious agents in hospitals. Demented or extremely frail patients may pose particular risk to other persons, because they may not be able to communicate and are only recognized after those who have come into contact with them fall ill. Also, cognitively impaired older patients may have difficulty keeping their facemasks on and sometimes exhibit high-risk behavior such as spitting. We report a cluster of seven cases (Table 1) illustrating the spread of SARS from a hospital to the community and, in particular, a nursing home. All the cases were diagnosed clinically 3 and had positive viral isolates or serological tests to coronavirus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 158, "end": 159, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 561, "end": 562, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1337, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1185, "end": 1194, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The nursing home involved was typical of many privately run institutions of its type.

This led to the inference that all older persons with multiple comorbidities and a history of recent contact with healthcare institutions were potentially infectious. Consequently, the preventive measures applied to hospitals were extended to all community and residential care facilities for the elderly.

Additionally, fully gowned and masked healthcare workers had to escort clients who required transport assistance.

Within nursing homes, the use of PPE deprived residents of the scant comfort they find in recognizing the familiar faces of their carers and led to confusion and fear, especially in residents with dementia. Restrictions on visitations have also deprived residents of the warmth derived from interacting with their loved ones, thus further exacerbating the situation. Restrictions on movements and the requirements for PPE also resulted in fewer outings for nursing home residents, further constricting their opportunity for interaction with the community at large.

S in Harry S Truman, the 33rd President of the United States, is Truman's full middle name, not an initial, 2 but in almost all the publications and dictionaries, S was followed by a period, as if it were an initial. S actually did not stand for anything, a practice not unknown among the Scotch-Irish. 2 Like Truman, my middle name is O, which is also not an initial. O is a phonetic translation of my middle name in Chinese, but it became an initial on my naturalization paper, so I have to live with this error for the rest of my life.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 163, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 643, "end": 644, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S IS HARRY S TRUMAN'S MIDDLE NAME, NOT AN INITIAL"}]}
