In this chapter, its role in plants, bacteria, and humans is scholarly discussed. Some plants have the possibility to accumulate this element, thus becoming a natural source for animals and humans, in which selenium is embedded in selenoproteins, as the 21 st amino acid, selenocysteine (l-Sec). The main classes of selenoenzymes (glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and iodothyronine deiodinases) are reported here and the molecular mechanism that characterizes their physiological action is discussed.",

            "text": "Selenium occurs naturally in the sedimentary rocks that were formed during the quaternary period [1] . The average Se concentration in soils is 0.4 mg/kg, even if it exists in areas that can be considered both extremely poorer and richer. In this second case, we refer to seleniferous soils and should be considered that high levels of selenium can emerge because of anthropic activities. From the soil, selenium can be transported into the plants using the normal sulfate transporting systems and, in the plant, it follows the same metabolic pathways of the sulfur derivatives, being assimilated by the incorporation in organic molecules or eliminated by volatilization in the atmosphere as DMeSe (dimethyl selenide) and DMeDSe (dimethyl diselenide) (Fig. 3.1 ) [2] . In the soil, and more generally in the environment, selenium is present in four different oxidation states: selenate (SeO 4 2\u2212 ), selenite (SeO 3 2\u2212 ), elemental (Se), and selenide (Se 2\u2212 ). The first two species are the most abundant inorganic forms and are characterized by a good mobility in the soil due to their high solubility in water. As a direct consequence, all the parameters of the soil that affect the oxidation state of selenium can influence its bioavailability. As an example, SeO 4 2\u2212 is more stable and available in alkaline conditions, whereas SeO 3 2\u2212 is normally present in all the other conditions. The presence of cations (e.g., Ca 2+ ) promotes its adsorption, whereas the anions (Cl \u2212 or sulfate) result in an inhibition of the process [3, 4] .",

            "text": "During the bioaccumulation, the inorganic forms of selenium are transformed into amino acids like selenomethionine (SeMet), selenocystine (SeCys), and methyl selenocystine (MeSeCys), or they can be methylated, leading to the formation of DMeSe, DMeDSe, dimethyl selenone (DMeSeO 2 ), methylselenol (MeSeH), and dimethyl selenyl-sulfide (DMeSeS) [13, 14] , sometimes with the assistance of some microorganisms, such as Alternaria and Penicillium corynebacterium [15] . Selenate and selenite ions, after the uptake from the soil, are metabolized in the chloroplasts, where the first one is transformed into the second by the action of an ATP sulfurylase that affords the intermediate formation of the adenosine 5\u2032-phosphoselenate (APSe), which is subsequently reduced to selenite by a specific reductase (Fig. 3.2 ). Even if in vitro the conversion of selenate in selenite can be easily and directly obtained by the treatment with glutathione (GSH), in vivo, the same process needs to be activated by a molecule of ATP. Once formed, selenite is reduced by GSH to selenide, which acts as co-substrate of the O-Acetyl-Serine (OAcSer) in the synthesis of the SeCys, that occurs still in the chloroplast. At this point, SeCys pass into the cytoplasm as it is, or after a series of enzymatic reactions to lead to the formation of the second main seleno-amino acid: the selenomethionine (SeMet) (Fig. 3. 2). SeCys and SeMet cannot be safely stored in the plant due to the risk of their misincorporation in the proteins. In some plants, SeCys, by the action of a lyase, is transformed into elemental selenium. More frequently, SeCys and SeMet are methylated to obtain intermediates that, because of the impossibility to be incorporated into the proteins, can be stored in the plant, or can be hydrolyzed to the volatile form of organic selenium, that are normally released on air. In more details, SeMet is subjected to a methylation catalyzed by L-methionine-S-methyltransferase, affording (MeSeMet) . The S-methyltransferase (SMT), using S-methylmethionine as a source of a methyl group, promotes the conversion of selenocysteine into the corresponding methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys). Both the methylated form MeSeMet and MeSec can be degraded to afford DMeDSe and DMeSe, respectively. In some cases, the volatilization from MeSeMet has been demonstrated to involve dimethyl selenopropionate as an intermediate and when it occurs, normally both mechanisms can be present at the same time. Furthermore, MeSeCys can be accumulated as it is or conjugated in the form of gamma-glutamylmethylselenocysteine (GMSeC) [16] . Quite recently, it has been reported that some plants have the capacity to absorb organic forms of Se such as SeCys and SeMet, but not insoluble elemental Se (Se 0 ) or metal selenide compounds [17] .",

The latter species are normally characterized by high concentrations of selenium stored as organic MeSec, preferentially in young leaves and in pollen, ovules, and seeds among reproductive organs. Based on a recent theory, the ability on hyperaccumulation is a defense mechanism rapidly developed by some vegetal species that affects its interaction with herbivores, pollinators, and other plants in the neighboring area.

The TrxR contains a FAD-binding domain and a NADPH-binding domain and is constituted by two subunits: the N-terminal subunit contains a redox-active dithiol and the C-terminal subunit a selenothiol, representing the redox active center of the enzyme. The mechanism proposed for the catalytic activity of TrxR starts with the reduction of the Se-S bond on selenenylsulfide subunit, affording a selenolate that, at physiological conditions, due to the pKa of the selenol, exists as a selenium-centered anion. The reduction occurs with the consumption of a NADPH and involves the intermediate action of a molecule of FAD. At this stage, a second electron-transfer from a molecule of NADPH reduces also the disulfide subunit, generating a thiol and a free cysteine, which is stabilized by the interaction with FAD. The anionic selenium reduces the disulfide of a molecule of Trx and the reduction is completed by the attack of the neighboring thiolate. Finally, the catalytic center is regenerated by the oxidation and the formation of a disulfide in the second subunit (Fig. 3 .5) [41] .",

Three main classes of ID's are currently known and, besides their presence in different tissues, they have a selective interaction with the hormone, promoting a selective and reductive deiodination (Table 3. 3). ID-I and ID-II are mainly involved in the activation of thyroxine (T4) into triiodothyronine (T3), increasing the thyroid activity by 5\u2032-deiodination in the outer ring of the T4 molecule. ID-III reduces the thyroid activity by the conversion of T4 into reverse T3 (iT3) and it is also responsible for the deiodination that transforms iT3 into T2 (Fig. 3.6 ) [44] . The understanding of the selective deiodination mechanism is still a matter of debate and for this reason some research groups, during the last decades, proposed small-sized selenium containing derivatives as mimetics of the three isoforms of deiodinase. Mugesh and coworkers investigated a series of naphthyl-derivatives [43] functionalized as dithiol, thiol-selenol or diselenol, demonstrating the superiority of the latter based on the simultaneous presence of an intermolecular halogen bonding and an intramolecular selenium bonding (Fig. 3.7 ) [45] [46] [47] [48] . The regioselectivity of these derivatives is in favor of the inner ring deioidination and, consequently, directed to reduce the thyroid function by the transformation of T4 into iT3 (mimicking the isoform III of the deiodinase).",
