Consequently, fire-prone vegetation communities are composed of species capable of regenerating through a variety of mechanisms, including resprouting, serotiny, and smoke-induced germination (Bond and van Wilgen 1996; Allen 2008). However, where fire is a novel disturbance \u2013 for example, when facilitated by invasions of non-native species \u2013 consequences can be dramatic, including transitions to alternative community states (Mack et al. 2000; Brooks et al. 2004).",

However, species composition of burned communities may simultaneously diverge due to variation in initial community composition and postfire environmental conditions (Fukami et al. 2005; Smart et al. 2006), complicating efforts to predict species-level changes through time. Under these circumstances, a plant functional type (PFT) approach may be particularly well suited for modeling community dynamics, where PFT is defined as a group of species with a similar response to disturbance based on a shared combination of functional traits (Lavorel and Garnier 2002). By generalizing beyond specific species associations and localities, PFT approaches have provided accurate, broad-scale predictions of vegetation response to a variety of conditions, including fire (Pausas et al. 2004; Keith et al. 2007; Gosper et al. 2012) and other disturbances (McIntyre and Lavorel 2001; De Bello et al. 2005).",

            "text": "The Mojave Desert of the southwestern United States is a clear example of a region experiencing widespread ecological change in response to a novel fire regime (Brooks and Minnich 2006). Over the past several decades, this region has experienced an unprecedented frequency of large-scale wildfires, fueled by invasive annual grasses in a process known as the invasive grass/fire cycle (D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992; Brooks and Esque 2002; Brooks and Matchett 2006). In 2005 alone, nearly one million acres within the Mojave Desert burned \u2013 an area larger in size than all fires in the previous 25 years combined (Brooks and Matchett 2006). Given that Mojave Desert vegetation has only recently become fire-prone (Brooks and Minnich 2006), many perennial plant species lack adaptations for regeneration after fire, and the resulting shifts in species composition and diversity have been severe, particularly in areas burned more than once (Steers 2008; Brooks 2012). However, the nature and duration of compositional change has varied based on initial community types (Engel and Abella 2011), and managers have grappled with how best to prioritize and plan restoration efforts. A PFT-based model of postfire vegetation change in this system would provide at least three advantages, including: (1) the ability to predict the responses of a large number of species to fire; (2) the ability to generalize predictions across community types; and (3) the ability to determine which communities will be slowest to recover, based on their PFT composition.",

In fire-prone environments, studies have found support for Egler's (1954) initial floristic composition (IFC) model, which stipulates that most species present during a successional sequence re-establish shortly after disturbance, with minimal dispersal and subsequent establishment of new species (Wilson et al. 1992; Barbour et al. 1999). Subsequent shifts in species composition reflect the differential growth rates, competitive abilities, and longevities of component species. Evidence for the applicability of this model to postfire succession in the Mojave Desert includes monotonic declines in diversity and cover following multiple burns (Steers 2008; Brooks 2012), and the fact that most species present in disturbed areas are also components of undisturbed vegetation, though in different quantities (Webb et al. 1988; Abella 2009).",

In terms of persistence and establishment, studies in fire-prone environments generally group species according to a dichotomy between resprouters and seeders (Pausas et al. 2004; Vesk et al. 2004). However, the proportion of species resprouting after fire is greater at the upper end of precipitation and productivity gradients, while obligate seeders are more abundant in areas with low precipitation (Clarke et al. 2005; Pausas and Bradstock 2007; Nano and Clarke 2011). In the Mojave Desert, where average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 130 mm in valley bottoms (Redmond 2009), resprouting is physiologically limited and dependent upon fire intensity and postfire climatic conditions (Brooks and Minnich 2006; Abella 2009; DeFalco et al. 2010). As a result, recovery for most perennial species occurs predominantly through seedling recruitment, and seed-related traits are therefore likely to be better predictors of postfire establishment than resprouting ability for most Mojave Desert species.",

It is widely accepted that fundamental resource allocation tradeoffs result in life-history strategies with characteristic functional traits and demographic patterns (e.g., Diaz and Cabido 1997; Barbour et al. 1999). One example is the tradeoff between investment in reproduction and investment in survival, which is reflected by differences in lifespan and seed size (Franco and Silvertown 2004; Moles and Westoby 2006; Adler et al. 2014). Growing empirical evidence suggests that simple morphological traits can predict life-history strategies of species across different regions (Diaz et al. 2004; Adler et al. 2014), and core lists have been proposed relating many of these traits to disturbance response (Weiher et al. 1999). However, tests for the ability of such traits to form the basis of PFT approaches predicting community response to disturbance are still lacking across a broad range of ecosystems.",

Further, we address the complementary hypothesis that species can be grouped into PFTs with a consistent response to fire based on natural co-occurrences of these traits. To evaluate these complementary hypotheses, we compiled datasets reflecting vegetation response to fire in the Mojave Desert at both short- and longer-term time scales and across a broad regional gradient. Results from this analysis will have direct applied relevance for land managers in our study system while addressing the question of whether PFTs based on simple morphological traits can predict perennial species response to fire in a desert environment that was historically not fire-prone. In an era of global change, the ability of PFTs to predict ecosystem response to novel disturbance regimes is a recurring issue in global vegetation modeling (Diaz and Cabido 1997), and whether or not PFT approaches can be based on easily observed traits is a central question due to the limited availability of trait information for many species (Cornelissen et al. 2003; Diaz et al. 2004; Lavorel et al. 2007).",

In the first step, we compiled life-history trait data for all perennial plant species included in short-term (1\u20134 years) and long-term (up to 52 years) postfire vegetation datasets. Second, we quantified individual species recovery following wildfire using a constrained ordination procedure. Third, we identified those life-history traits with a significant influence on species recovery through multivariate permutation testing. Finally, we derived and evaluated fire-response PFTs through a classification of species based on significant life-history traits. Each stage of our analysis is described in greater detail below.

All live perennial plant cover was measured along randomly located transects using a line-intercept technique, in which the canopy of all plants intersecting a transect line was measured. Vegetation cover measurements from all four sites were combined to form the short-term dataset with a total of 685 transects and 35 species. Fire treatment (burned or unburned) and the number of years postfire (1\u20134) were also recorded individually for each transect. Consistent with our aim of generalizing species responses across a range of conditions, this dataset included measurements conducted in several different vegetation communities (Table 1).",

Studies reporting cover values differed in sampling technique, with three reporting line-intercept measurements and two reporting visual cover-class estimates from quadrats. In order to account for measurement differences between studies, we relativized the combined plot \u00d7 species matrix by dividing each row in the matrix by the sum of all elements in that row, creating a measure of relative abundance. Because all plots had unburned controls, later analysis (step 2, below) reflected differences in relative abundance between burned and unburned areas regardless of measurement technique.

The traits, their definitions, and hypothesized ecological functions are provided in Table 2. These traits also represent the different processes influencing vegetation succession under the IFC model \u2013 persistence/regeneration, competitive ability, growth rate, and longevity \u2013 by distinguishing different life-history strategies. Lifespan and seed size distinguish species with fast life histories and high fecundity from those with slow life histories and high survival (Franco and Silvertown 2004; Adler et al. 2014), while short leaf lifespans indicate large investment toward growth (Reich et al. 1992; Adler et al. 2014). Seed dispersal relates to regeneration ability (Noble and Slatyer 1980; McIntyre et al. 1999), while maximum height and vegetative spread may both serve as indicators of competitive ability (Weiher et al. 1999; Keith et al. 2007). Growth form and growth structure both relate to the resistance and resilience of a species to physical damage, thereby influencing the level of persistence. However, growth form influences a variety of other factors, including growth rate and generation time (Silvertown et al. 1993), and is regarded as one of the major determinants of a species' ability to cope with disturbance (Lavorel et al. 1997).",

Growth form and growth structure were defined according to Baldwin et al. (2012) or the flora of North America (http://floranorthamerica.org/). Species heights were defined using the maximum value from ranges provided in Baldwin et al. (2012). Seed mass values were taken from the Kew Seed Information Database (Royal Botanic Gardens Kew 2014, http://data.kew.org/sid/) and the Baker Seed Herbarium (Jepson Flora Project 2006, http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/EFT.html). Both height and seed mass were also split into ordinal classes, rather than treated as continuous variables, in order to minimize the potential for error in trait assignments (Table 2). Because many seeds are dispersed by ants and rodents in deserts in general (Gutterman 1994) and in the Mojave Desert in particular (DeFalco et al. 2009, 2012), we included seed dispersal as a binary trait separating wind-dispersed from non-wind-dispersed species. Species were classified as wind-dispersed if their seeds possessed mechanisms to aid in dispersal, including wings, hairs, or small size (<1 mg), and did not possess obvious mechanisms for zoochory (e.g., burs, encased in fleshy fruit). Finally, we defined three broad classes for the lifespan trait (Table 2) and based estimates on observational or empirical studies (e.g., Bowers et al. 1995) or information from databases (USDA Fire Effects Information System, http://www.feis-crs.org/beta). All perennial forbs were classified as short-lived (1\u201320 years). Full trait values, along with source information, are provided in Appendix S1.",

OMI does not assume any particular mathematical distribution in species' responses to the environment and gives equal weight to species-poor and species-rich sites (Kleyer et al. 2012). In the resulting ordinations, OMI places species (columns of the input matrix) in environmental space rather than sites (rows). In biological terms, this means that species with a high score on an OMI axis are exhibiting a strong response to the environmental variables used as axis constraints, whereas species located near the origin are exhibiting a weak response (i.e., generalist species). We used fire treatment (burned or unburned) as a constraining factor in OMI ordinations for both datasets. The number of years postfire (1\u20134 years) was also used as a constraining variable for the short-term dataset, while, for the long-term dataset, we grouped plots into postfire decade (1\u20135 decades). After conducting OMI on both datasets, we extracted species scores (positions of species on x-and y-axes of ordination) for use as response variables in step 3. These values reflect only the variability in the input datasets associated with the two constraining variables (burn treatment and years or decades postfire) and therefore represent a relative measure of species abundances in burned versus unburned areas through time.",

Additionally, woody species could be grouped into PFTs with a consistent response to fire based on recurring combinations of life-history traits. This consistency in grouping occurred because traits that were decreased by fire (e.g., long lifespan, large seeds, tall height) combined in some species, while traits that were increased (short lifespan, small wind-dispersed seeds, deciduous leaves, low height) combined in others (Table 4). Of particular note is that widespread, dominant species in this ecoregion, including Larrea tridentata, Coleogyne ramosissima, and Yucca brevifolia, fell within Groups 2 and 3 in our analysis and possess a set of traits limiting their ability to regenerate following fire. Given the scope of our datasets, which spanned different vegetation communities, temporal scales, and a broad geographic region, our results suggest that a PFT approach based on simple morphological traits can be used to model the effects of fire across the Mojave Desert.",

Indeed, this trait alone could serve as a general predictor for the short-term (1\u20134 years) responses of most species to fire. Forbs and grasses were consistently more abundant in burned areas across both time scales of our analysis, whereas cacti were consistently reduced by fire. Only woody species exhibited a variable response that warranted classification into separate PFTs. The predictive value of growth form as a disturbance-response trait likely results from its influence on a variety of factors, including resistance and resilience to physical damage, growth rate, and generation time (Lavorel et al. 2007). For example, cacti are typically fire-killed due to tissue desiccation (Esque et al. 2004), produce large seeds with limited dispersal ability, and have episodic recruitment patterns with narrow climatic requirements for successful seedling establishment (God\u00ednez-Alvarez et al. 2003). Several studies have suggested that PFT approaches should be hierarchically structured within major growth forms (Lavorel et al. 1997; Pausas and Lavorel 2003), and this assertion is supported by our analysis. Although growth form has high predictive value as a trait, the specific responses we detected may not be generalizable to other fire-prone environments or disturbance types. For example, woody species in fire-prone Mediterranean shrublands are able to regenerate shortly after fire through both seeding and resprouting (Keeley et al. 2006), in stark contrast to Mojave Desert species.",

For example, woody species in Group 3 were characterized by long lifespans and large seeds, traits that reflect a slow life-history with greater investment toward individual survival (Grime 1977; Adler et al. 2014). In contrast, Group 1 species had small, wind-dispersed seeds, short lifespans, and deciduous leaves \u2013 traits thought to reflect investments in fecundity and growth (Franco and Silvertown 2004; Adler et al. 2014). Species in Group 2, though low in number (n = 5), were intermediate, with some traits linked to investments in fecundity (medium-sized, wind-dispersed seeds) and others linked to investment in survival (evergreen leaves, long lifespan; Adler et al. 2014). Life-history theory suggests that investments in growth and fecundity increase a species ability to respond to disturbance (Grime 1977), and thus our results (Group 1 species were favored by fire, Group 2 and 3 species were reduced) are largely consistent with this prediction. Our finding that species with greater longevity were slowest to recover is also consistent with the IFC model, which predicts that differences in species longevities will shape successional trajectories (Egler 1954; Wilson et al. 1992).",

            "text": "It is also important to consider ecological mechanisms beyond links to life-history through which the traits we considered may have influenced species responses to fire. A variety of interrelated factors influence the \u201cregeneration niche\u201d in arid environments, or the ability of species to regenerate via seed. Large seeds are typically rare in desert seed banks (Guo et al. 1998; DeFalco et al. 2009), in part due to preferential granivory by ants and rodents (Price and Joyner 1997; Hulme 1998). Long-lived desert species with large seeds \u2013 including cacti - typically do not have persistent soil-stored seed banks and instead produce copious quantities of seed during rare, favorable climatic events (Goldberg and Turner 1986; Cody 2000; God\u00ednez-Alvarez et al. 2003; Chesson et al. 2004; Reynolds et al. 2012). Much of the reproductive potential for these species is therefore stored in aboveground canopies, which may be eliminated by a single fire. In contrast, small seeds compose a large fraction of desert seed banks (Guo et al. 1999) and are able to sift deeper into the soil and survive peak fire temperatures (Brooks 2002; Esque et al. 2010). Short-lived and small-seeded desert species also produce seedlings more frequently than do long-lived species, indicating less exacting climatic requirements for germination (Goldberg and Turner 1986). Aided by the potential for long-distance wind dispersal, small-seeded species probably have broader regeneration niches following fire than large-seeded species due to both life-history and other ecological mechanisms.",

This, along with the finding that only Group 1 species were favored by fire even at a longer time scale, appears to support our assertion that resprouting is less important as a regeneration mechanism than seedling establishment due to low and variable precipitation levels (Clarke et al. 2005; Abella 2009; DeFalco et al. 2010). Also, resprouters tend to be long-lived, with heavy propagules \u2013 characteristic of the fire-reduced Groups 2 and 3 in our analysis (Pausas et al. 2004). A lack of effective resprouting would distinguish Mojave Desert vegetation from other fire-prone communities where resprouting is a common fire-response syndrome, such as Mediterranean shrublands (Allen 2008). However, it should be noted that a small number of species in PFT Group 3 were associated with burned areas in the long-term dataset, including Ephedra viridis, Prunus fasciculata, Yucca baccata, and Lycium cooperi, and it is possible that these species were able to regenerate through low levels of resprouting. However, unburned patches can also occur during low-intensity surface fires in the Mojave Desert, where individual plants may survive with only slight scorching (Abella 2009).",

First, we were unable to account for intraspecific variability in species traits, which may be as important as interspecific variability in influencing species responses to fire (Dantas et al. 2012). Secondly, some traits had to be represented through ordinal classes (e.g., height, seed size) rather than with a continuous approach because traits for many species in the Mojave Desert have not been quantitatively measured across a variety of conditions. Both of these limitations may have reduced the accuracy of our PFT approach with respect to our study system, while the second may reduce its generality to other contexts. We also were unable to incorporate information concerning such factors as fire intensity, fire season, topography, and postfire climatic conditions when developing our PFT model, although variation in these factors could conceivably alter the way in which traits influence species' responses to fire. For example, wildfires in the Mojave Desert may range from surface to crown fires depending on annual fuel buildup (Brooks and Minnich 2006), and this variation in fire intensity could change how woody species of different heights are affected. Similarly, postfire climatic conditions may influence survival rates of scorched vegetation and newly emerged seedlings (DeFalco et al. 2010). Despite these limitations, our PFT approach was able to predict how the majority of species responded to fire, indicating its generality to a wide range of contexts.",

Changes to regional climates expected over the next century may exacerbate this cycle, particularly more frequent shifts between moist El Ni\u00f1o climatic phases that promote annual fuel buildup and subsequent dry La Ni\u00f1a phases that promote fire (McCabe et al. 2004; Allen and Soden 2008).
