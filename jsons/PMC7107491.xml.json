            "text": "Our study presents data linking the clinical features at the initial KD presentation to the clinical outcomes of periungual peeling, CAA, IVIG resistance, and subsequent diagnosis of autoimmune/autoinflammaotry diagnoses. We added a rating scale to the overall confidence in the KD diagnosis, which allowed us to gauge the overall clinical impression on the day of treatment for KD. There are potential benefits to standardizing documentation of the clinical presentation of KD on the day of treatment. First, the standardization of data collection allows for reassessment of the diagnostic certainty before proceeding with subsequent treatments for those who fail to respond to initial IVIG. This is important before considering additional doses of IVIG, because adverse effects can be dose dependent, such as hemolytic anemia [5\u20137]. Second, more precise associations of clinical outcomes with the type of KD, especially incomplete KD, can be made using this approach. Utilization of the AHA algorithm for incomplete KD has been shown to improve the diagnosis of KD in children who developed CAA [8], but the accuracy of the diagnosis for those with incomplete KD who do not meet these criteria is less clear. Among children with incomplete KD who did not meet the AHA criteria and whose initial echocardiograms were normal in this cohort, the IVIG resistance rate remained relatively high at 11%, but none developed CAA, and they had a trend towards lower rate of periungual peeling than other groups. Finally, utilization of this approach can allow for more precise epidemiologic data for the incidence and characteristics of IVIG resistance. Intravenous immunoglobulin resistance rates may vary [9], but these rates may be related to a lower likelihood of an accurate diagnosis of KD initially in some patients.",

We have previously reported the clinical presentation of systemic onset juvenile arthritis after the KD diagnosis and noted on literature review of prior reported cases that most were diagnosed as incomplete KD specifically lacking scleral injection [4]. Mevalonate kinase deficiency and PFAPA diagnoses causing recurrent fevers have been previously described after initial treatment for incomplete KD [10, 11]. Whether children who were subsequently diagnosed with an autoimmune/autoinflammatory illness actually had KD initially or had an alternative diagnosis is unclear. It has been suggested that recurrent fever disorders and KD may share the same propensity for activation of innate immune responses causing elevations in cytokine profiles and that the diseases may be related in those predisposed [11]. In either case, clinicians should observe these children for development of other symptoms. Longer-term cardiology follow-up visits for KD patients may represent an ideal time to screen for autoimmune/autoinflammatory symptoms and referral when appropriate.",

Before discharge, we identified children as high or low risk for development of CAA based on known risk factors [9, 17]: ie, age (infants), those requiring intensive care, and those with nonresponse to initial IVIG treatment. For these high-risk patients and children with known CAA, follow up is 3\u20137 days after discharge. Among the 4 children with baseline normal echocardiograms who went on to develop CAA, all met at least 1 high-risk criterion.",

Moreover, the tool in the electronic medical record required continued education of providers to increase compliance. Nonetheless, these data suggest that further study correlating the clinical KD phenotype on the day of presentation with clinical outcomes, including subsequent diagnoses of autoimmune/autoinflammatory disorders, should be considered. Prospective and standardized collection of KD criteria on the day of treatment together with clinical outcomes can provide useful information to further refine the KD diagnosis and the potential for risk of subsequent autoimmune/autoinflammatory conditions.",
