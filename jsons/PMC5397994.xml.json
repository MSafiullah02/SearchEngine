It is a prototypic second messenger that plays crucial roles in cellular responses to various stimulations, and mediates signaling pathways related to many human diseases including cancer, cardiac and urinary dysfunction, diabetes, immunological diseases and nerve disease.1, 2, 3, 4 Protein kinase A (PKA) and cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channels were the first discovered cAMP mediators and originally considered as the only ones. In 1998, two independent groups reported another cAMP mediator named exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPACs).5, 6 EPAC is a family of cAMP-binding proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) activity that directly activate Ras-like small GTPases (Rap1 and Rap2).5, 6 The discovery of EPAC proteins has significantly facilitated the understanding of cAMP-dependent signaling pathway and opens new avenues for developing novel therapeutics targeting cancer, diabetes, heart failure, inflammation, infectious diseases, neurological disorders and other human conditions.1, 7, 8, 9, 10\n",

The multi-domain protein EPAC2 has three isoforms (EPAC2A, EPAC2B and EPAC2C) with about 115 kDa of molecular weight and is enriched in nervous system and endocrine tissues. EPAC1 and EPAC2 proteins have considerable similarity in the structure and sequence (68% similarity in human).11 Both EPAC1 and EPAC2 consist of two regions, the N-terminal regulatory region and the C-terminal catalytic region. The regulatory region of EPAC protein includes a disheveled, Egl-10, pleckstrin (DEP) domain and cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). The C-terminal catalytic regions of EPAC1 and EPAC2 are composed of three basic domains named as cell division cycle 25 homology GEF domain (CDC25-HD), Ras association (RA) domain, and Ras exchange motif (REM) domain.12, 13\n",

The N-terminal regulatory region and the C-terminal catalytic region of EPAC are held together through intramolecular interactions, thereby preventing Rap binding to the CDC25-HD of EPAC and keeping EPAC inactive (Fig. 1\n).14 When cell is stimulated by extracellular signals, ACs are activated through various ligands which bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and promote the conversion of ATP into cAMP.15 The binding of cAMP to CNBD allows the regulatory region to rotate about 90\u00b0 sideways and leaves enough space for Rap binding to CDC25-HD.15 Consequently, active EPAC catalyzes the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and controls Rap-mediated biological functions (Fig. 1). The EPAC signaling pathway plays a critical role in various biological responses including insulin secretion, neuronal function, cardiovascular function, vascular function, inflammation, cancer, pain, and infections.1, 7, 8, 9, 10\n",

EPAC1 is limited in nuclear signaling while EPAC2 is found to gather around the T tubules, indicating that EPAC2 is involved in the arrhythmogenic SR Ca2+ leak.37 EPAC also plays a critical role in the development of cardiac fibrosis.38 The important involvement of EPAC in cardiovascular functions offers a new direction for the discovery of new treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

In addition, EPAC exhibits anti-inflammatory activity against interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor signaling through up-regulating the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in VECs.47 Both in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that inhibition of EPAC led to the expression vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) decrease and mediated the effect of Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) activity. These findings indicate that EPAC-PDE4 signaling pathway may provide a novel means for the treatment of vascular inflammation inclusive of atherosclerosis and in-stent restenosis.48 Moreover, recent hyperalgesia priming and EPAC knockout mouse model studies uncovered a key role of EPAC1 in chronic inflammatory pain under the control of EPAC1 phosphorylation mediated by GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2).49, 50 It is worth to mention that EPAC is also associated with airway diseases via modulating airway smooth muscle cell functions.51, 52, 53 Taken together, EPAC is an emerging therapeutic target for the drug discovery of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation and airway diseases.",

Numerous papers support that EPAC1 promote various cancer cells (including cervical,58 fibrosarcoma,59 melanoma,60 ovarian,61 pancreatic62 and prostate63) migration and metastasis. The cAMP-mediated immune functions are well documented, but the breakthrough work on implication of EPAC in anti-cancer immunotherapy has not been reported until recently. EPAC1 was identified to play an essential role in the regulation of T-cell-mediated immunosuppression.64 Interestingly, results from a recent study suggest that EPAC signaling pathway may up-regulate the aerobic glycolysis, and promote oncogenesis.65 All these studies demonstrate EPAC1 is an emerging target for cancer therapy.",

A breakthrough on EPAC selective modulators was made by Bos and co-workers27, 70 Through the comparison of the binding sites of compound 1 with EPAC and PKA cAMP domains, they found that the 2\u2032-OH group of the compound 1 could form hydrogen bond with highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu238 in human PKA protein) in the PKA cAMP domain, which is absent in the EPAC cAMP binding site (Fig. 3\n). Interaction between the 2\u2032-OH group and conserved glutamate residue is essential for cAMP binding to the PKA cAMP domain and modification of the 2\u2032-OH group could lead to selective EAPC modulators. Based on these findings, a series of 2\u2032-O-alkyl-modified analogues of compound 1, for example, compound 2 (2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP, Fig. 2), were designed, and they exhibited about 10- to 100-fold EPAC/PKA selectivity.27 It is worth to mention that replacing the 2\u2032-OH group by hydrogen led to compound 3 (2\u2032-deoxy-cAMP, Fig. 2).71 Compound 3 showed some EPAC/PKA selectivity, but with a dramatic loss of its EPAC activation activity compared to compound 1.",

Since the discovery of compound 4, it has been widely used as a powerful tool for elucidating the EPAC functions.72, 73, 74, 75 In rat models, injection of compound 4 can provoke mechanical hyperalgesia through the mechanism of activating the \u03b5 isoform of PKC.72 When 5-HT at the threshold and subthreshold concentrations, compound 4 remarkably increased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations.73 Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) cultures, treated with compound 4, at a 100 \u00b5M level, decreased approximately 40% HIV-1 viral replication.74 According to the most recent studies, compound 4 recapitulated the cocaine-induced increase in GluA2-lacking \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), indicating its therapeutic potential for drug additions.75Based on its aforementioned advantages, compound 4 has been widely employed as a useful chemical probe for EPAC function studies, but its biological application is limited due to its poor plasma membrane penetrating capability. Esterification of the negatively charged singly bonded oxygen of the compound 4 phosphate group led to compound 5 (8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP-AM, a.k.a. 007-AM, Fig. 2), which contains a mixture of the equatorial and the axial isomers.76 Compound 5 works as a prodrug of 4, and can be hydrolyzed to release 4 quickly after crossing the plasma membrane. Compound 5 displays an effect of over 100-fold more potent than compound 4 without affecting its EPAC/PKA selectivity, and it has greatly facilitated the studies of EPAC signaling pathways.1, 12 However, it is a good substrate for phosphodiesterases (PDE) and also acts as a PDE inhibitor.10\n",

Three compounds from the NCI diversity set library were identified with IC50 values range from 1.7 to 7.9 \u00b5M in competing with compound 9 in binding EPAC2.84 Furthermore, they expanded their screening to the Maybridge Hitfinder compound library with about 14,400 compounds.85 Seven compounds (compounds 10 to 16, Fig. 4) were discovered to completely inhibit EPAC2 GEF activities at 25 \u00b5M in the presence of a same concentration of cAMP.",

            "text": "A preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) of compound 14 revealed that choro atom at C3-position of phenyl ring was essential for the EPAC inhibitory activities. Replacing the choro atom at C3-position of phenyl ring with hydrogen atom led to compound 20 (IC50\n = 59.8 \u00b5M) (Fig. 7\n), with about 6-fold activity loss of EPAC2 inhibition. Adding another Cl atom at 5-position of compound 14 led to compound 21 (Fig. 7). The IC50 value of compound 21 (IC50\n = 1.9 \u00b5M for EPAC2) was about 5-fold improvement compared to compound 14. Further, Zhou and co-workers.101 systematically investigated SAR of compound 14. Alteration of the linker and modification of the substitutes on isoxazole ring resulted in a dramatic activity loss. However, a slightly modification on the phenyl ring by addition of a third choro atom on compound 21 afforded compound 22 (Fig. 7). Compound 22 was proved to be a potent compound with an IC50 value of 0.9 \u00b5M for EPAC2 inhibition. In addition, it also showed a high EPAC1 inhibitory effect with an IC50 value of 2.4 \u00b5M. Molecular docking studies show that compound 22 could form hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with EPAC2 CBD.1, 101 The motif on the isoxazole ring can stretch into the hydrophobic pocket and form hydrophobic interactions with residues of Phe367, Leu406, Ala407 and Ala415, while the phenyl moiety occupies and interacts with the hydrophobic pocket consisting of Val386 and Leu397. Moreover, there is a crucial hydrogen bond between NH of the linker and the side oxygen atom of residue Asp402.",

Further, compound 23 was reported to exhibit modest selectivity on EPAC1 versus EPAC2, providing an EPAC1 selective inhibitor.103 An early SAR study indicated that the substituents on the tetrahydroquinoline pharmacophore was requisite for the EPAC1 inhibitory activity. The stereochemistry also plays an important role in EPAC1 inhibitory activity, and its (R)-enantiomer (24) was found to be 10-fold more potent than its (S)-enantiomer (25) in EPAC1 GEF inhibition in vitro. In addition, compound 24 exhibits 10-fold selectivity for EPAC1 versus EPAC2. Compound 24 may serve as a useful chemical probe for elucidating biological functions of EPAC1, while more relevant studies are needed to further validate its target-specificity and therapeutic potential.",

For example, the first breakthrough work on development of EPAC activator compound 4 through rational design facilitated by the co-crystal structural analysis of compound 1 and EPAC2. Although compound 4 and its prodrug have been useful as pharmacological tools for probing cAMP-mediated signaling, the big challenge is that it exhibits cross-target activities and off-target effects. Thus, the therapeutic applications of such cAMP analogues as EPAC agonists are potentially limited.",

Due to the excellent EPAC/PKA selectivity of compound 14, it has been widely applied as a useful chemical probe to discriminate EPAC related signaling pathways and biological functions. In addition, compound 14 and its analogues exert excellent in vivo PK and toxicity profiles and are promising lead compounds for therapeutic applications. Nevertheless, more extensive chemical optimizations are imperative to improve the potency (ideally submicromolar to nanomolar IC50) and the isoform-selectivity (EPAC1 vs. EPAC2) of this class of EPAC inhibitors. Therefore, EPAC-isoform specific agonists or antagonists with high potency and selectivity are still in urgent need, and to this end, modern drug discovery approaches (e.g. HTS, fragment-based drug discovery104, 105, 106 and computer-aided drug design107 may pave the way. Of note, EPAC1 and EPAC2 may play significant and distinct biological roles in a variety of human diseases, especially in cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, CNS disorders (e.g. drug addiction, and pain), infections and diabetes. Hence, potent EPAC agonists or antagonists with high EPAC1 or EPAC2-isoform selectivity, as well as ideal pharmacokinetic profiles are highly appreciated for further clinical development towards a viable therapeutic strategy for various human diseases.",
