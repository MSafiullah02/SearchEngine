Three members of the caveolin family have been identified to date: caveolin-1 (Cav-1, previously named VIP-21), caveolin-2 (Cav-2), and caveolin-3 (Cav-3, previously named M-caveolin) (Williams and Lisanti, 2004, Way and Parton, 1996). Caveolin-1 was first identified as a principal protein component of caveolae membranes (Kurzchalia et al., 1992). Subsequently, caveolin-1 was found highly expressed in cells with abundant caveolae and caveolin-1 expression was also found necessary or sufficient to generate caveolae membranes (Kim et al., 2006). Caveolin-1 directly binds to cholesterol, employing the \u201ccholesterol recognition amino acid consensus\u201d sequence composed of residues 95\u2013101 in the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD). The cholesterol-binding capacity of caveolin-1 plays a key role in maintaining a stable balance of intracellular cholesterol, allowing caveolin-1 to act as a transporter that directs cholesterol efflux, selective uptake, and the delivery of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane (Fielding, 2006). The membrane binding and lipid raft interactions of synthetic peptides derived from the CSD of the caveolin-1 protein (caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide, SDP) have been investigated (Horton et al., 2006, Benferhat et al., 2008).",

It is thought to function as a scaffolding protein that organizes and concentrates cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and caveolae-associated signaling molecules, such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase, H-ras, Src-like kinase, G proteins, Janus kinase (Jak), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins, among others (Couet et al., 1997, Ju et al., 1997, Harris et al., 2002, Schutzer et al., 2005, Baran et al., 2007, Elsasser et al., 2007, Rath et al., 2009). Caveolae are known to act as organizing centers for immune-related signal transduction pathways, such as the Jak\u2013Stat signaling pathway or the NF\u03baB\u2013I\u03baB signaling pathway, etc. (Harris et al., 2002, Garrean et al., 2006). In mammals, the Jak\u2013Stat signaling pathway functions in host defense against viral and bacterial infections (Lad et al., 2005, Haller and Weber, 2009). The Jak\u2013Stat signal transduction pathway is activated by a large number of cytokines and growth factors, including interferon (IFN)-\u03b1/\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and growth hormone (GH), among others (Imada and Leonard, 2000, Levy and Darnell, 2002, Gao, 2005, Chelbi-Alix and Wietzerbin, 2007, Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009). In mammalian cells, caveolin-1 protein has been reported to inhibit the Jak\u2013Stat signaling pathway through direct interaction with Stat3 protein (Shah et al., 2002).",

The primary structure and functional roles of caveolin-1 protein have been described in other vertebrates, such as humans, mice, sheep, rabbits, and frogs, etc. (Glenney and Soppet, 1992, Sargiacomo et al., 1993, Tang et al., 1994, Lavialle et al., 2000, Chen et al., 2001). However, the biological roles of caveolin-1 with respect to immune responses in fish are still not well understood.",

BLAST homology analysis showed close matches of mCav-1 with caveolin-1 from other vertebrates. The complete sequence of mCav-1 cDNA was 707 bp and contained a 5\u2032-UTR of 49 bp, followed by an open reading frame (ORF) of 546 bp encoding a predicted protein of 181 amino acid residues and a 3\u2032-UTR of 112 bp, including 23 nucleotides of the polyadenylation tail. The full-length sequence of mCav-1 was deposited in GenBank under accession no. FJ695596, and the deduced amino acid sequence was determined (Fig. 1A). Two potential translation start sites were observed within the N terminus of the mCav-1 gene, which indicated mCav-1 might occur as two isoforms (\u03b1- and \u03b2-isoforms). The SMART program results showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of mCav-1 shared similar architecture of vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins, but mCav-1 lacked a phosphorylation site (y14). Multiple amino acid alignments of mCav-1 with other known vertebrate caveolin-1 molecules revealed a significant homology with the other known caveolin-1 sequences present in the database. Bioinformation analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the mCav-1 share a similar architecture with vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins, including a N-end region, a signature motif (FEDVIAEP), a caveolin scaffolding domain, and a C-end region (Fig. 1B). The mCav-1 had highest amino acid identity (above 90%) and similarity (above 95%) with caveolin-1 proteins from zebrafish (Danio rerio), pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), and fugu (Takifugu rubripes) compared with other vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins.",

The anti-mCav-1 antiserum used in our work was generated in New Zealand white rabbits by immunization with purified MBP-mCav-1 fusion protein. Fluorescence microscopy showed mCav-1 (red fluorescence) to be located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm with dot distribution in MFF-1 cells, whereas mCav-1 was not observed in the nucleus (blue fluorescence) (Fig. 2A). A detergent-free method for preparing cholesterol-enriched fractions from MFF-1 cells was used. Caveolae are resistant to nonionic detergents and could be extracted by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient followed by 1% Triton X-100 treatment (Beer et al., 2005). The detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) that are buoyant on low-density sucrose gradients have unique caveolae enriched with cholesterol, glycolipids, and caveolin proteins. Equal volume fractions of DRM and detergent-soluble membranes (DSMs) were separated by gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blotting using anti-mCav-1 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 2B, mCav-1 protein was detected in the DRM (Fig. 2B, lanes 4\u20139) but was absent in the DSM (Fig. 2B, lanes 10\u201312). These results were consistent with the typical distribution of caveolin-1 in mammalian cells (Parkin et al., 1996). M\u03b2CD, fillipin III, or nystatin (which deplete or sequester membrane cholesterol) is employed to disrupt the caveolae structure (Foster et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2009). As shown in Fig. 2C, the distribution of mCav-1 was altered and enriched in the DSM fractions (Fig. 2C, lanes 10\u201312) when cells were treated with M\u03b2CD, filipin III, or nystatin, whereas in cells not treated with drugs, mCav-1 was found primarily in the DRM (Fig. 2C, lanes 4\u20139). In addition, the electron micrographs show typical membrane invaginations found at the plasma membrane of MFF-1 cells (Fig. 2D, arrows). These results suggested that the major subcellular location for mCav-1 was in caveolae.",

However, the tissue expression pattern of caveolin-1 has not yet been rigorously studied in fish. To establish the tissue-specific distribution of caveolin-1 protein in mandarin fish, we prepared extracts from a number of different tissues and used immunoblotting assays to compare the mCav-1 expression levels. Equal weights (\u223c100 \u03bcg) of each tissue were separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-mCav-1 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 3\n, mCav-1 protein had two isoforms (\u03b1- or \u03b2-isoform) that were detected in most tissues. This was different from expression of endogenous mCav-1 in MFF-1 cells, where only the \u03b1-isoform was detected. The \u03b1- or \u03b2-isoforms were expressed in the fat tissue, heart, gills, intestine, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and spleen, but were not detected in the brain or hemocytes. On a tissue weight basis, the levels of the \u03b1-isoform were generally higher than the levels of the \u03b2-isoform in fat tissue, heart, gills, and skeletal muscle. Consistent with the large numbers of invaginated caveolae in other vertebrate tissues, mCav-1 was prevalent in smooth muscle (e.g., intestine) and adipocytes (e.g., fat tissues). High levels of mCav-1 protein were also expressed in heart tissue, which appeared to contain as much as skeletal muscle. The highest level of mCav-1 was in the spleen, which, interestingly, is not considered to have large numbers of caveolae (Frank et al., 2009). The spleen, however, is an important immune organ of mandarin fish and was also the major target tissue for ISKNV (He et al., 2001), which suggested that mCav-1 might be involved in immune function.",

For instance, expression of the mMx gene was markedly increased \u223c350-fold by treatment of the cells with poly(I:C) for 8\u201312 h, compared to the untreated controls (0 h), while the expression of the mMx gene was increased \u223c180-fold and noticeably decreased by treatment of the cells with poly(I:C) and mSDP (p\n < 0.01).

The entry of ISKNV into MFF-1 cells and its potential association with mCav-1 were examined in cells treated with mSDP and then infected with ISKNV virus. Infections were scored by measuring expression of the ISKNV membrane protein ORF101L using immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 6A, mSDP concentrations higher than 1 \u03bcM significantly inhibited ISKNV entry into cells and the inhibition was dose-dependent. Treatment with 5, 10, 20, and 30 \u03bcM mSDP significantly inhibited ISKNV infection by 75, 90, 95, and 98%, respectively, compared to the untreated control (0 \u03bcM mSDP).

As shown in Fig. 6B, the ORF101L protein levels were significantly reduced when cells were treated with 5, 10, and 25 \u03bcM mSDP, compared to the untreated control (0 \u03bcM).

Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of mCav-1 shared a similar architecture with vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins and had a high identity score with the caveolin-1 from zebrafish, fugu, and pufferfish. In mammals, Tyr14 phosphorylation has emerged recently as a major switch that controls caveolin-1 physiological function in response to extracellular signal molecules and cell stressors such as insulin, IGF-I, EGF, VEGF, PDGF, IL-6, oxidants, hyperosmolarity, and UV irradiation, among others (Fielding, 2006). One interesting feature that distinguished the caveolin-1 proteins from mandarin fish from those of zebrafish and humans was that caveolin-1 proteins from mandarin fish, fugu, and pufferfish lacked a Tyr-14 residue (Fig. 1B). In addition, we also found that caveolin-1 proteins from mandarin fish, fugu, and pufferfish lacked a reduced Tyr within the first 1\u201325 amino acids. This indicated that caveolin-1 protein from these three fish did not undergo Tyr14 phosphorylation. Further research is needed to determine whether mCav-1 has mechanisms other than the Tyr14 phosphorylation typical of zebrafish and mammalian caveolin-1 to activate associated-signal events. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the evolution of caveolae-associated molecules and signaling pathways in fish.",

In the present paper, the major subcellular location of mCav-1 was detected in the caveolae (Fig. 2), suggesting that mCav-1 plays its major functional roles there. Caveolae act as organizing centers for signaling molecules in the immune system (Harris et al., 2002), such as the Jak\u2013Stat signal transduction pathway. The important signal molecules of this pathway, the Jak and Stat proteins, have been found in caveolae and directly interact with caveolin-1 protein to inhibit the Jak\u2013Stat signaling pathway (Ju et al., 2000, Park et al., 2002, Shah et al., 2002, Jasmin et al., 2006a). The Jak\u2013Stat transduction pathway plays a critical role in host defenses against viral and bacterial infections and is involved in fish immune system function (Guo et al., 2009). However, the biological roles of caveolin-1 in fish immune responses are still not well understood, including those of the Jak\u2013Stat signal transduction pathway.",

            "text": "In the present study, the effects of caveolin-1 on the Jak\u2013Stat signal transduction pathway were measured in MFF-1 cells by mSDP inhibition. The coupling of molecules to a 16-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the homeodomain of the Drosophila transcription factor Antennapedia (AP) is well known to facilitate their uptake into cultured mammalian cells through a non-endocytosis pathway (Perkins et al., 1988, Ou et al., 2003, Jasmin et al., 2006b). Accordingly, coupling of the Cav-1 scaffolding domain to the AP peptide (Cav-1 SDP) was recently shown to facilitate its translocation across the cell membranes and to inhibit signal transduction pathways (Song et al., 2007). Our current results showed that the poly(I:C)-induced Jak\u2013Stat signal transduction pathway strongly induced the expression of Mx, IRF-1, SOCS1, and SOCS3 genes in MFF-1 cells (Fig. 4), which was consistent with previously reported observations (Guo et al., 2009). However, this enhanced gene expression was significantly impaired by the presence of the mCav-1 scaffolding domain peptide in MFF-1 cells (Fig. 4). These data suggested that one of the functional roles of mCav-1 protein is participation in the Jak\u2013Stat signaling pathway, which is similar to the known role of mammalian caveolin-1. The caveolin-1 scaffolding domain inhibits many of the signal molecules in mammalian cells, such as the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase A, thioredoxin reductase 1, transient receptor potential channel-1, etc. (Schlegel et al., 1999, Bucci et al., 2000, Kwiatek et al., 2006, Levin et al., 2007). For this reason, we suggest that caveolae might also act as organizing centers for signaling molecules in the fish immune system.",

            "text": "We found that the expression of mCav-1 protein was clearly increased at 12 h and 24 h in the MFF-1 cells infected with ISKNV (Fig. 5). The mCav-1 protein may therefore play a key role in virus infection. Every virus infection begins with entry of the virus into the host cell. Virus entry is a multi-stage process involving the specific attachment of the virus particle to cell surface receptor(s), followed by internalization of the virus into the cell and subsequent uncoating of the virion to release the capsids or their contents into the cytoplasm (S\u00e1nchez-San Mart\u00edn et al., 2004). Each of these stages represents an important target for combating a virus before it can gain control over the host cell machinery for replication (Rojek et al., 2008). In general, a number of different endocytosis pathway for viruses have been characterized, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveola-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, etc. (Vidricaire and Tremblay, 2007). Unlike other forms of endocytosis, caveolin-1 is necessary for caveola-dependent endocytosis, as shown by caveolin-1 siRNA experiments or overexpression of caveolin-1 (Nichols, 2003). In our work, ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells was inhibited when cells were treated with mSDP (Fig. 6). This result indicated that ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells was associated with caveolae/caveolin-1, and may occur via a caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway. Caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway has been demonstrated for many viruses, such as enterovirus (Stuart et al., 2002), coronavirus 229E (Nomura et al., 2004), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (O\u2019Donnell et al., 2008), etc. Thus, the entry of ISKNV into MFF-1 cells appears to occur via a caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway.",
