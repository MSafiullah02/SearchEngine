In 1890, Emil von Behring and Shibasabur\u014d Kitasato found that na\u00efve rabbits can be protected from a lethal dose of diphtheria or tetanus toxin if injected with the serum of rabbits immunized with this toxin (Behring and Kitasato 1890), and in 1901, von Behring was awarded the very first Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology \u201cfor his work on serotherapy.\u201d1 The same year, while on board the yacht of Prince Albert the 1st of Monaco, Charles Richet and Paul Portier discovered anaphylaxis when immunizing dogs with minute amounts of toxins from sea anemones. They published their provocative finding in 1902 (Richet and Portier 1902). Five years later, Richet showed that anaphylactic hypersensitivity can be transferred to na\u00efve dogs by the serum of immunized dogs (Richet 1907). Richet was awarded the 1913 Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology \u201cfor his work on anaphylaxis.\u201d2 It was therefore the same scientist who demonstrated that immune serum can either protect or kill recipients, when challenged with deadly pathogens or harmless doses of toxins, respectively.",

Antibodies, indeed, protect from infectious diseases, they account for the long-term protection conferred by vaccines and they are increasingly used for passive immunotherapy.

One reason is that, by themselves, antibodies exert no biological effects.",

It was indeed found recently that both the neutralization of viruses and the neutralization of bacterial toxins, which have long been paradigmatic examples of biological properties of antibodies due to the masking of specific sites on antigens, require more than binding. They require the Fc portion of antibodies and depend on receptors for antibodies (Joller et al. 2010; Mallery et al. 2010). For antibodies to affect antigens, they indeed need not only to bind to antigen epitopes through their Fab portions, but also to interact through their Fc portion with effector systems. These include soluble molecules such as components of the enzymatic cascade of Complement, and cells that express receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies (FcRs).\n",

A proportion of high-affinity FcRs may therefore be occupied in vivo. Antibodies however may dissociate from high-affinity FcRs, which makes receptors available for binding other antibodies. The dissociation constant of high-affinity FcRs therefore critically determines their availability for other antibodies present in the environment. This can be exemplified by the murine high-affinity receptor for IgG2 Fc\u03b3RIV (K\na for IgG2a \u00b1 3 \u00d7 107 M\u22121). We found that this receptor is also a low-affinity receptor for IgE (Ka \u00b1 5 \u00d7 105 M\u22121), and we wondered whether this property is biologically meaningful. One indeed expects Fc\u03b3RIV to be saturated by IgG2 in vivo, and thus unavailable for IgE. We found that the half life of IgG2 on Fc\u03b3RIV is of a few minutes only at 37 \u00b0C, and that IgE immune complexes can perfectly replace IgG2 on Fc\u03b3RIV in the presence of normal serum (Mancardi et al. 2008). On the contrary, the extremely high affinity constant (Ka \u00b1 109\u22121010 M\u22121) of Fc\u03b5RI, the high-affinity receptors for IgE expressed by mast cells and basophils in mice and humans, is due to an extremely low dissociation constant (Kulczycki and Metzger 1974). As a consequence, IgE antibodies remain bound to Fc\u03b5RI for extended periods of time, in spite of their extremely low plasma concentration.",

As a consequence, in the absence of antigen, low-affinity FcRs (e.g., Fc\u03b3Rs) remain free in spite of the high concentration of circulating immunoglobulins, (e.g., IgG). They are therefore available for immune complexes whenever these come close enough. Immune complexes bind to low-affinity FcR-expressing cells because antibodies are concentrated on multivalent antigens in immune complexes and because many antibodies can bind at the same time to many FcRs on the same cell membrane. Once bound to FcRs, immune complexes remain on low-affinity FcR-expressing cells because antibodies that dissociate from individual FcRs are rapidly replaced by other antibodies present in the complex. Antibodies that dissociate from FcRs and remain bound to antigen can also engage FcRs that were not previously engaged.

Antibodies are therefore viewed as binding in trans, to target cell antigens via their Fab portions and to effector cell FcRs via their Fc portion. If target cells express FcRs, antibodies can bind in cis, i.e., to target antigens via their Fab portions and to FcRs via their Fc portion on the same cell (Fig. 3). Binding to antigens located on the same membrane as FcRs markedly enhances the local concentration of antibodies as they are concentrated in a plane rather than dispersed in a volume. Binding to FcRs is also enhanced by the local concentration, i.e., the density, of specific epitopes on the cell membrane. Such an Fc-FcR cis binding was demonstrated to trigger mast cell activation using alloantibodies against MHC class I antigens expressed by the same cells (Da\u00ebron et al. 1975; Da\u00ebron and Voisin 1978). It was extensively used to inhibit B cell activation using anti-immunoglobulin IgG antibodies (Phillips and Parker 1983).

Thus, each heavy chain of IgG1 contains a single covalently attached biantennary N-glycan at the highly conserved N297 residue in its CH2 domain. Point mutations of this glycosylation site abrogate the ability of IgG antibodies to bind to Fc\u03b3Rs. If engineered with such a mutation (e.g., N297Q), aglycosylated antibodies therefore no longer engage Fc\u03b3Rs and they can be used as blocking-only molecules (Veri et al. 2007). Noticeably, N297 mutations do not affect the binding of IgG to neonatal FcRs (FcRn), which protect IgG from degradation.",

It is shared by all activating multi-chain FcRs. FcR\u03b2 is a 4-transmembrane domain polypeptide that associates with multi-chain FcRs expressed in mast cells and basophils (Kinet et al. 1988). Multi-chain FcRs must associate with at least one specific subunit in order to be expressed. Most need FcR\u03b3 (Lobell et al. 1993; Takai et al. 1994; Letourneur et al. 1995). The expression of these receptors therefore depends on the tissue distribution of FcR\u03b3, and FcR\u03b3-deficient mice have no activating FcR (Takai et al. 1994). Mouse Fc\u03b5RI, but not human Fc\u03b5RI, also need to associate with FcR\u03b2 (Kinet 1999). As FcR\u03b2 is expressed by mast cells and basophils only in both species, the expression of Fc\u03b5RI is restricted to these cells in mice (Kinet et al. 1988), but not in humans (Gounni et al. 1994, 2001; Joseph et al. 1997). FcRn do not associate with FcR\u03b3 or with another ITAM-containing subunit, but with \u03b22 microblobulin and this association is mandatory for FcRn to be expressed (Israel et al. 1995).",

FcRs can also form homo-aggregates when engaged by immune complexes made with monoclonal antibodies of a single specificity as they are commonly used in the laboratory. Engaging FcRs under these conditions has been instrumental for establishing the binding parameters of FcRs and for elucidating the mechanisms of signal transduction used by FcRs.

Even when immunizing mice with protocols that promote strong Th1 responses, such as one injection of a high concentration of proteins in Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant followed by repeated injections of the same high dose of antigen in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant, IgG1 antibodies remain, by far, the dominant isotype of antibodies, and detectable levels of IgE antibodies can even be observed in serum (Jonsson et al. 2011). As a consequence, immune complexes that form in vivo contain antibodies of several classes and subclasses. As FcRs with different specificities are co-expressed by most FcR-expessing cells, pluri-isotypic immune complexes engage several types of FcRs on cell membranes.

Fc\u03b3RIIA, however, contain two ITAMs when dimeric (Powell et al. 2006). The significance of the presence of several ITAMs in immunoreceptors is unknown. One ITAM is enough as the aggregation of single-chain chimeric molecules with the intracytoplasmic domain of FcR\u03b3, FcR\u03b2, TCR\u03b6 activated the transfected cells in which they were expressed (Da\u00ebron et al. 1995a), although Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 triggered different Ca2+ signals in B cells (Choquet et al. 1994) Upon receptor aggregation, ITAMs are phosphorylated by src family tyrosine kinases. This intracellular chemical perturbation initiates the constitution of dynamic intracellular signalosomes, in which activation signals are generated. Signalosomes build up on tyrosine-rich transmembrane adapter proteins that reside constitutively in lipid-rich membrane microdomains (Bezman and Koretzky 2007). Signals propagate intracellularly via various metabolic pathways that altogether lead to gene transcription, activation of the lipid metabolism and membrane alterations associated with exocytosis.",

Inhibition signals generated by activating FcRs such as Fc\u03b5RI can be readily observed when challenging mast cells sensitized with IgE antibodies by increasing concentrations of specific antigen. Mast cell degranulation dose-dependently increases up to a maximum. Degranulation thereafter decreases rapidly down to background levels. This inhibition in excess of antigen has long been interpreted as resulting from a reduced ability of antigen to aggregate efficiently Fc\u03b5RI (Wofsy et al. 1978). Inducible phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, however, keeps increasing beyond the optimal concentration of antigen. Moreover, inhibition in excess of antigen is abrogated in mast cells from mice deficient for the SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase SHIP1 (Gimborn et al. 2005). Finally, mast cells from SHIP1-deficient mice display enhanced degranulation responses to optimal and suboptimal antigen concentrations (Huber et al. 1998). Fc\u03b5RI therefore generate SHIP1-dependent inhibition signals both when suboptimally or optimally aggregated and when supra-optimally aggregated by antigen. Similar effects of SHIP1 deficiency were observed with other activating FcRs (Nakamura et al. 2002). ITAM-containing FcRs therefore generate a mixture of activation and inhibition signals (Malbec et al. 2004). Activation signals are dominant over inhibition signals under physiological conditions.",

This widely accepted interpretation forgot IgG-induced passive anaphylaxis described by Zoltan Ovary in the 1950s (Ovary 1952a, b), before IgE antibodies were discovered (Ishizaka et al. 1966). IgG1-induced PSA was later shown to depend on Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Miyajima et al. 1997). Responsible cells, however, still remain unidentified as this reaction was not abrogated in mast cell (Miyajima et al. 1997) or in basophil deficient mice (Ohnmacht et al. 2010). More recently, we found that mice lacking Fc\u03b5RI and Fc\u03b5RII or Fc\u03b3RIIIA developed active systemic anaphylaxis (ASA) as severe as did wild-type mice, when immunized with antigen in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant and challenged with antigen intravenously. Likewise, using quintuple FcR-deficient (5KO) mice that express one activating FcR only, the high-affinity receptor for IgG2 Fc\u03b3RIV expressed by monocyte/macrophages and by neutrophils, we unraveled the unexpected role of neutrophils in ASA (Jonsson et al. 2011).",

When FcR-deficient mice became available, it was unexpectedly found that Fc\u03b3RIIB-dependent negative regulation does not account for this feedback regulation by antibodies. This regulation was unaltered not only in Fc\u03b3RIIB-deficient mice (Heyman et al. 2001), but also in mice lacking all Fc\u03b3R (Karlsson et al. 1999).

Both human Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIA triggered IgG-induced PSA and ASA. Fc\u03b3RIIA expressed by mast cells were also responsible for IgG-induced PCA. Human skin mast cells express Fc\u03b3RIIA, but no Fc\u03b3RIIB (Zhao et al. 2006). Interestingly, a mouse deficient for all endogenous Fc\u03b3R and transgenic for all human Fc\u03b3R underwent anaphylaxis following an injection of aggregated human IgG (Smith et al. 2012).",

This ratio is high in human neutrophils and these cells respond robustly to IgG immune complexes. In accordance with this in vitro observation, the transfert of human neutrophils restored anaphylaxis in FcR\u03b3-deficient mice (Jonsson et al. 2011). This ratio is very low in human basophils, and these cells do not respond to the same immune complexes. IgG receptors expressed by human basophils indeed function as inhibitors of cell activation, and IgG immune complexes that co-engaged Fc\u03b3R with Fc\u03b5RI on basophils inhibited IgE-dependent basophil activation in all normal donors tested (Cassard et al. 2012).",

As discussed in this review, their action is more subtle. They engage multiple receptors with adaptative structures and signaling on a variety of cells with adaptive functional responses, which enables immune responses to adapt to the infinite varitions of antigenic stimulations. Taking into account the complexity of interactions between antigens, antibodies, FcRs and cells occuring here and there in the body is not only an exciting challenge, it has become a requirement for understanding the pathogenesis of disease and for developing new therapeutic tools. One can indeed exploit this complexity to ameliorate immunotherapy and to conceive new antibody-dependent approaches of a variety of diseases.",

They develop at the intersection of a plurality of systemic effectors and of a plurality of tissue effectors. This may also apply to local or tissue-specific infections in which symptoms are primarily due to the anti-pathogen immune response. Thus, if one takes the example of allergies, the clinical manifestations of cutaneous allergies and of respiratory allergies depend on effector cells present in the skin and in the respiratory tract, respectively, and on target organs that do not respond identically to inflammatory mediators secreted by effector cells. Better understanding the polymorphism of allergies is a mean to better treat them.",

When binding to HER2, Trastuzumab not only inhibits the proliferation of breast, ovary or lung cancer cells by preventing receptor dimerization (Yakes et al. 2002), it also induces tumor destruction by engaging activating FcRs on cytotoxic cells (Clynes et al. 2000). Antibodies against molecules expressed by dendritic cells can also enhance antigen presentation and, as a consequence, T-cell dependent cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Unexpectedly, this effect was found to involve Fc\u03b3RIIB (Li and Ravetch 2011). Indeed, when binding in trans to Fc\u03b3RIIB-expressing cells by their Fc portion, anti-TNF receptors antibodies mimic the effect of multimeric ligands and they aggregate TNF receptors much more efficiently than when they do not (Li and Ravetch 2013).",

            "text": "The efficacy of therapeutic antibodies having been established, one can now aim at enhancing their wanted effects while decreasing their unwanted effects. The situation is simpler than in active immune responses because therapeutic antibodies are directed against a single epitope, because they are mono-isotypic and because most are humanized antibodies made by grafting antigen-specific variable sequences onto the same human backbone (the constant domains of a well-know human IgG1 in many cases). Thus, one can engineer therapeutic antibodies so that they have specific properties. One can mutate the main glycosylation site (e.g., introduce a N297Q point mutation in the Fc portion) to generate antibodies that can bind to target antigens without engaging FcRs except FcRn, which preserves their half life (Veri et al. 2007). One can increase the half life of antibodies by generating mutations that enhance the affinity of the Fc portion for FcRn (Ward and Ober 2009). As a consequence, the plasma concentration of therapeutic antibodies is increased (Dall\u2019Acqua et al. 2006). One can either change the glycosylation or generate mutations that enhance the affinity of antibodies for activating FcRs. Thus, mutations that remove fucose residues from the Fc portion of antibodies, enhance their affinity for human Fc\u03b3RIIIA (Natsume et al. 2005; Niwa et al. 2005). Conversely, one can generate antibodies with mutations in the Fc portion that enhance the affinity of antibodies for inhibitory FcRs. Thus, anti-human CD19 antibodies that bind to Fc\u03b3RIIB with a several hundred-fold higher affinity than nonmutated antibodies, suppressed BCR-dependent activation of B cells from healthy donors or from SLE patients, reduced serum IgM, IgG, and IgE levels in SCID mice engrafted with SLE PBMC, and increased survival of mice engrafted with PBMC from a SLE patient (Horton et al. 2011). Likewise, anti-IgE antibodies with an Fc portion having an increased affinity for Fc\u03b3RIIB further reduced free and total IgE levels by preventing the generation of IgE-secreting plasma cells (Chu et al. 2012).",

Also, as exemplified by anti-SARS coronavirus antibodies, one wants to prevent antibodies from enabling the virus to infect FcR-expressing cells that are not infected in the absence of antibodies (Jaume et al. 2011). No protective anti-cancer vaccine is available yet, and efforts are being made to induce and/or amplify cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells.

This would extend the field of application of vaccines to diseases other than infectious diseases and cancer, such as inflammatory diseases. Specific immunotherapy of allergy is an example.
