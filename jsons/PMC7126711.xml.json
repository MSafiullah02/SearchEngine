            "text": "Rhinosinusitis (RS) is the more correct term for sinusitis in children, because most infections begin with or have a concomitant rhinitis. In addition, the pathophysiology of the disease is thought to be more than just an abscess cavity of the sinus, and probably involves changes in the mucosa of both the nose and sinus cavities. Several varieties of RS can be categorized as follows:1.A. Acute RS (ARS) most commonly presents as an acute upper respiratory infection (URI) that persists (without improvement) beyond 10 days, with the key signs and symptoms being nasal discharge, cough, and bad breath. The 10-day mark is somewhat subjective, because viral URIs can persist beyond 10 days. A more accurate predictor of ARS would be the worsening of symptoms at 7 to 10 days, whereas with viral URIs, some improvement typically would be noted.B.A less common presentation of ARS is that of a \u201csevere\u201d URI, with fever of 102\u00b0F plus concurrent purulent nasal discharge for 3 to 4 consecutive days. Conversely, acute rhinitis that is preceded by fever (not concurrent with fever) usually is viral in origin.2.\nChronic RS (CRS) is a more indolent infection that lasts beyond 3 months, with the typical symptoms being nasal congestion, cough, and bad breath. Other signs and symptoms include behavioral problems, headache, and nasal discharge. Exacerbations are common.3.\nRecurrent ARS (RARS) implies recurrent infections with relatively healthy intervals in between, although some element of CRS usually is present between acute infections.\n",

            "text": "The common diagnostic problem is differentiating a viral URI from a sinus infection. In general, the diagnosis of ARS and CRS depends on clinical presentation alone, correlated with physical findings. Although occasionally not seen in CRS, the finding of purulent secretions in the region of the middle meatus is highly suggestive of sinusitis. Radiographic imaging is reserved for children with refractory RS who are being considered for surgery, or for suspected complications such as orbital or cranial infection. CT scanning, which is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of sinusitis [2], will demonstrate sinus opacification in most children who have a nasal discharge that is self-limited in nature and who will never require antibiotics [3]. When the clinical presentations of ARS and CRS described above are correlated with findings on anterior rhinoscopy\u2014which is best performed looking through an otoscope while gently pushing up on the nares\u2014the diagnosis of RS is quite accurate. When rigid diagnostic criteria are adhered to, relatively few children with nasal congestion actually will be diagnosed as having RS [4]; this fact reinforces the need for careful diagnosis. Studies suggest that decreased measured levels of nitric oxide in exhaled nasal air may distinguish RS from URI [5], though this procedure is experimental at the present time.",

            "text": "When considering treatment options, it is critical to be aware of those forces that contribute to the development of RS. Knowledge of these \u201ccausative factors\u201d will allow for treatment and prevention of disease by more appropriate medical or nonmedical means. For example, sinusitis caused by allergy is best prevented by knowledge and avoidance of offending allergens, as opposed to chronic antibiotics. More importantly, if these factors are neglected, treatment ultimately will not be successful. Although some of the causative factors listed below are uncommon, they still must be considered if suggested by the clinical scenario.1.\nURI: Most sinus infections in children develop following a viral URI, most commonly rhinovirus, coronavirus, and influenza virus. Children average between six to eight colds a year (and even more in day-care settings), of which 5% to 10% are complicated by RS. Inflammation of sinus ostia causes stasis of secretions and poor ventilation of the affected sinus. This leads to absorption of oxygen and the development of a relative negative pressure or vacuum within the sinus, causing movement of intranasal contents and nasopharyngeal bacteria into the sinus cavity. Viruses also can have a direct inhibitory effect on ciliary function. Finally, there is increased bacterial growth in the presence of viral infection.2.\nBacterial pathogens: As in purulent otitis media, most ARS is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (nontypable), and Moraxella catarrhalis. In addition to these bacteria, CRS also can be caused by anaerobic organisms and Staphylococcus aureus. Resistance patterns are important in predicting response to antimicrobial therapy: H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis can be resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics such as ampicillin due to beta-lactamase production. In contrast, S. pneumonia and S. aureus can be resistant to the penicillins and most other antibiotics by a genetic alteration in penicillin-binding proteins. This form of resistance is much more significant because it is not treated successfully by the typical \u201csecond-line\u201d agents such as cephalosporins, macrolides, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Oral antibiotic options include high-dose amoxicillin and clindamycin.3.\nAllergy: The relationship between allergy and RS in children is well known. More than 80% of children with RS have a family history of allergy, as opposed to a general population allergy frequency of 15% to 20% [6]. More than half of sinusitis is closely associated with asthma, a recognized allergic-mediated disease [7]. Finally, when various allergy tests are employed, more than half of the children with chronic sinusitis will have some element of allergy [8]. Allergy can contribute to sinusitis by either nasal congestion and subsequent ostia obstruction, or direct allergic effects on sinus lining cells. Although not IgE mediated, cow's milk protein allergy may be present in very young children with a history of rashes or colic, and can be a contributing factor to RS in these children.4.\nAdenoid vegetations: The adenoid is a lymphoid organ located in the nasopharynx, similar in form and function to the pharyngeal tonsils. The adenoid contributes to RS in children by serving as a bacterial reservoir, similar to otitis media. Cultures of the adenoid core demonstrate organisms similar to those seen in RS [9], and studies have shown that removal of the adenoid will improve RS for 70% to 80% of children [10]. As in otitis media, the size of the adenoid pad is unrelated to the ability to harbor pathogens.5.\nAirway pollutants can have direct irritant effects on the nasal and sinus mucosa. The most significant irritant in RS is environmental tobacco smoke, which has been shown to cause otitis media in children, and has been suggested to similarly contribute to RS.6.\nStructural anomalies of the sinus and nasal cavity are rare causes of sinusitis, and include septal deviation, lateral nasal wall anomalies (paradoxical middle turbinate, concha bullosa, Haller cells), and maxillary sinus hypoplasia [11].7.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Many opinions exist as to the relationship between GERD and RS in children, although most pediatric otolaryngologists agree that some RS is due to, or exacerbated by, GERD. GERD is prevalent in children with CRS [12], while double-lumen pH probe testing has shown that esophageal reflux can extend to the area of the nasopharynx [12], [13], [14]. A recent retrospective study [15] suggested that GERD therapy could prevent sinus surgery in almost 90% of children with refractory CRS.8.\nImmunologic defects: All young children have a relative immune-deficient state due to a slow rise in immunoglobulin production, which may be a more important causative factor than is allergy in younger children. This is demonstrated by a decrease in RS prevalence in older children, despite an increase in the prevalence of allergy [16]. In contrast to this self-limited phenomenon, pathologic immune deficiency can cause severe and refractory RS in affected children. Humoral immunodeficiency is the most common disorder in these children, with IgG subclass deficiency being the most common subtype [8]. In general, children with immune deficiency will present with multiple upper and lower respiratory infections in addition to RS, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and otitis media.9.\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD): PCD is a rare disorder of ciliary structure or function that can occur alone, or can be a part of the more global Kartagener's syndrome. Structural abnormalities can be demonstrated by electron microscopy of nasal or tracheal biopsies, and include deviation of the normal 9 + 2 microtubule structure or a more subtle decrease in dyenin arm count [17]. Functional abnormalities can occur despite normal ciliary architecture, and can be demonstrated by a decrease in ciliary beat frequency [18], although this test is mainly of research interest and rarely is used in clinical settings. As with children who have immunologic defects, children with PCD will have other upper and lower respiratory infections in addition to RS.10.\nCystic fibrosis (CF): CF occurs in 1 in 3200 white newborns in the United States, and is the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disorder in whites [19]. Affected children present with chronic upper and lower respiratory infections\u2014most commonly pneumonia and severe refractory RS\u2014often with nasal polyp formation. Other manifestations include malnutrition, intestinal obstruction, and pancreatic insufficiency [19]. Although elevated sweat chloride concentrations are the hallmark of CF diagnosis, the ability to detect specific genetic mutations recently has been shown to be a much more reliable and accurate method of diagnosis, especially in less severely affected children [20], [21]. These children can have milder upper and lower respiratory disease including RS, and may have normal sweat chloride concentrations.\n",

            "text": "Causative factors were detailed previously, and must be included in the treatment approach. They are particularly important in the prevention and treatment of recurrent or chronic infections. A summary of causative factors as they pertain to treatment approach is given below; adenoid and structural anomalies are addressed in the section on surgical therapy.1.Although URIs are an inevitable part of childhood, certain steps can decrease their incidence and severity. Day-care centers should be as small and clean as possible, and older siblings should be encouraged to wash up as soon as they get home from school or day care.2.Knowledge of local bacterial prevalence and resistance patterns are available from hospital microbiology labs. In addition, appropriate use of antibiotics for bacterial URIs will discourage the growth of resistant bacteria in both the child and the community.3.Allergy should be considered in all children with the following: a history of allergic signs and symptoms (watery rhinorrhea, pruritis, sneezing, transverse nasal crease, allergic shiners, frequent rashes), seasonal patterns of infection, specific allergen reactions (dust, pet dander, particular foods), and a strong family history of allergy or asthma. Whereas milder seasonal allergies can be treated with antihistamines and inhaled nasal steroids, more severe cases are best evaluated and treated by a pediatric allergist who can identify the allergen and prescribe avoidance techniques, targeted drug therapy, and immunotherapy when necessary. The topic of cow's milk protein allergy in young children is controversial, although milk should be avoided in very young children with frequent or chronic RS who also have a history of neonatal colic or rashes.4.Exposure to passive smoke must be eliminated due to its potential effects on nasal and sinus mucosa. In addition, otitis media and asthma can be prevented by this reasonable intervention.5.GERD should be considered in all children with difficult RS in addition to other suggestive features, including frequent vomiting; unexplained respiratory symptoms such as vocal cord spasms, early hoarseness, and atypical wheezing; and findings on physical exam such as cobblestone appearance of the pharynx. The evaluation of suspected GERD is best performed by a pediatric gastroenterologist who is experienced in the relationship between RS and GERD; this evaluation typically involves pH probe testing. Direct laryngoscopy with posterior laryngeal biopsy can help to diagnose upper airway GERD when there are findings of posterior laryngeal edema, mucosa cobblestoning, and biopsy with eosinophils in the basement membrane [15]. Empiric therapy with an H2 blocker such as ranitidine may be considered in a young child with suspected reflux-induced rhinitis [23]. A positive response to this \u201ctherapeutic trial\u201d strongly suggests GERD as an etiologic factor.6.Immune deficiency, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), and CF are relatively uncommon, although they should be suspected in children with difficult RS together with a history of frequent upper and lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis.\na.Immune testing typically includes total immunoglobulin levels, IgG subclass levels, and postvaccination titers to pneumococcal and H. influenzae type b vaccines [24]. Immunoglobulin replacement and daily antibiotics are the basis of successful therapy [24], [25], although gene therapy eventually may prove to be successful in these patients and is presently being evaluated in clinical trials [25].b.Evaluation of ciliary structure can be performed on specimens obtained from nasal brushings (posterior turbinate), although tracheal brushings performed via bronchoscopy have a higher yield of respiratory mucosa. Although there is no specific treatment for PCD, the chronic use of treatment and prophylactic antibiotics can then be rationalized better.c.CF testing traditionally has involved sweat sodium chloride levels, although genetic testing now is accepted as the more accurate method of diagnosis, especially in children with milder phenotypic variants of CF that may indeed have normal sweat tests. This disease is best treated by an experienced CF practitioner.\n",

Indeed, a recent, randomized placebo-controlled study of 188 children with ARS between 1 and 18 years [28] showed no benefit of antibiotics over placebo in sinus symptoms, relapse, or recurrence, although this study included older children and excluded sicker children. In contrast, most studies [29], [30], [31], [32] have suggested that antibiotics allow for earlier resolution and may prevent recurrence, prompting the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to recommend in their recent guidelines [33] that antibiotics be used in the treatment of ARS of suspected bacterial etiology. These recommendations were either evidence based or consensus based when no clear data existed.\u2022For young children with mild to moderate ARS, amoxicillin is recommended at the normal (45 mg/kg) or high dose (90 mg/kg).\u2022Patients with amoxicillin allergy should be treated with a cephalosporin such as cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime, whereas severely allergic patients should be treated with a macrolide such as clarithromycin or azithromycin.\u2022Children that do not respond to first-line therapy, children with more severe initial disease, and children who are considered high-risk for resistant S. pneumoniae (those who recently have used antibiotics or attend day care) should be treated with high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg of amoxicillin component).\u2022Parenteral ceftriaxone should be used in those children who are vomiting and cannot take oral antibiotics.\n",

Based on these data, they recommended that children with mild sinus disease and no antecedent antibiotic use in 6 weeks receive amoxicillin/clavulanate (93.5% efficacy), low-dose or high-dose amoxicillin (91% efficacy), cefpodoxime (86.7% efficacy), or cefuroxime (83.7% efficacy) [30]. Children who are allergic to penicillins should receive erythromycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin, despite lower predicted efficacy. More severely affected children should initially receive those drugs with the highest predicted efficacy. Optimum duration of therapy in ARS has never been proven in scientific trials, although recommendations typically include 10 to 21 days, or until symptoms resolve plus an additional 7 days [34].",

In contrast, a recent, large, double-tap otitis media study [47] showed that high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg) covered 94% of H. influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains), and 98% of S. pneumoniae, including more than 90% of the resistant S. pneumoniae. This bacteriologic profile makes high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate an ideal drug for the treatment of CRS, although no scientific studies exist. In addition, as compared with the macrolides, beta-lactams are less likely to contribute to the growth of resistant bacteria in the nasopharynx [48]. High dose amoxicillin/clavulanatemust be taken twice daily, however, and also has a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects than most other antibiotics, though the incidence is no greater than that with regular-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate [49].",

A reasonable yet subjective approach is the following: surgery is indicated for children with CRS or RAS who have failed maximum medical therapy (see above); are unlikely to have untreated allergy or GERD; and who have no untreated contributory systemic disease such as immune deficiency, PCD, or CF. This approach will avoid unnecessary surgery [53], and improve the quality of life of those difficult cases that fail appropriate medical therapy [41].",

Adenoidectomy is almost always the first-line surgical intervention for preschoolers, and often is appropriate in older children. The expected rate of improvement is 70% to 80% [9], [10], [44]. Adenoidectomy is safe, has minimal morbidity, and has no effect on long-term immune function; and children can usually return to school within 1 to 2 days. Controversy as to whether or not perform adenoidectomy aloneexists in older children or when the adenoid pad is small [9], [26], [54], although if the pathophysiology is that of bacterial reservoir [9], adenoidectomy still is an appropriate first-line surgical option. Although no studies have shown maximum medical therapy to be effective,it (see above) may be continued for several weeks after adenoidectomy, in the hopes of completely sterilizing the sinus cavities following removal of the likely bacterial reservoir. The potential detrimental effects of increased bacterial resistance, however, must be considered in the decision for or against prolonged antibiotics.",

In contrast to older traditional techniques of sinus surgery, ESS focuses on enlarging the natural ostia of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses, while preserving most or all of the sinus mucosa. In properly selected children, the results are good, with an expected improvement of 80% to 100% [22], [55], [56]. Preoperative CT scan is essential in defining the specific diseased sinuses, and in looking for anatomic abnormalities that need to be addressed, including septal deviation, concha bullosa, and paradoxical middle turbinate. The typical procedure, however, is that of a \u201cmini-ESS,\u201d consisting of uncinectomy plus limited anterior ethmoidectomy. The surgery should be performed only by an otolaryngologist experienced in pediatric ESS [22], [55]; when properly performed, the incidence of major complications is less than 1% [55]. Theoretic concerns with adverse effects on facial growth [57] have not been substantiated in human trials [58], [59]. Second-look endoscopy is unnecessary [60], although maximum medical therapy (see above) should be continued for several weeks after ESS. Reasonable caregiver expectations are essential\u2014parents and children should expect an improvement, but not a cure.",
