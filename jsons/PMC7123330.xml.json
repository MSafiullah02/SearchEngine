            "text": "Bees produce several different products which have health benefits. There is no doubt that honey has a highly significant status in medical treatments, while other apian materials, such as wax, royal jelly and propolis, have fewer medical applications, despite the fact that propolis has been used by people since ancient times (Burdock 1998; Ghisalberti 1979). The term propolis comes from two Greek words, pro (which means for or in defence of) and polis (which means the city); thus propolis means in defence of the city or beehive (Ghisalberti 1979). Propolis is a sticky resinous substance, which is gathered from buds and the bark of trees. It is also known as \u201cbee glue\u201d as bees use it to cover surfaces, seal holes and close gaps in their hives, thus providing a sterile environment that protects them from microbes and spore-producing organisms, including fungi and molds (Wagh 2013). It is therefore considered to be a potent chemical weapon against bacteria, viruses, and other pathogenic microorganisms that may invade the bee colony. Also, bees use propolis as an embalming substance, to mummify invaders such as other insects, that have been killed and are too heavy to remove from the colony (Bankova et al. 2005a; Wagh 2013). Humans have certainly observed the behaviour of honeybees and the ways in which they use propolis in their hives, which might have inspired interest in the biological properties of bee glue. Therefore, it is not surprising that propolis has become a subject of interest in natural product studies in recent times. The literature on propolis is vast and even a lengthy review cannot cover everything, but can only give an indication of the areas of interest in propolis research. There have been many reviews of the chemical and biological properties of propolis over the years and the most recent ones are listed here: Bankova et al. (2016), Sforcin (2016), Bankova et al. (2014), Silva-Carvalho et al. (2015), Chandna et al. (2014), Toreti et al. (2013), Wagh (2013), Sforcin and Bankova (2011).",

Many other ancient civilizations, such as Chinese, Indian, and Arabian, all believed in the power of propolis to treat medical conditions like sores, ulcers, and some skin lesions, so it was used both internally and externally (Kuropatnicki et al. 2013). For a comprehensive review of the history of propolis use see Kuropatnicki et al. (2013). Despite such early use, propolis is often still considered a \u201cfolk medicine\u201d and remains an unofficial drug in the field of pharmacy (Valenzuela-Barra et al. 2015; Kuropatnicki et al. 2013; Toreti et al. 2013). However, over the last two decades, its use has begun to gain scientific backing. It is considered to be a promising natural source for the discovery of new pharmaceutical products to treat several types of diseases. Thus, it has been subjected to intensive studies investigating its antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immune-stimulating, and anticancer properties (Banskota et al. 2001b). Nevertheless, propolis is still not considered an official conventional medicine in healthcare because of a lack of standardization of its composition due to the variability of its chemical components and thus its biological activity, which varies according to the different geographic locations of its collection (Silva-Carvalho et al. 2015). In addition, there is presently inadequate data regarding therapeutic efficacy from clinical trial studies involving propolis. As a result, there are a few propolis products which have undergone FDA approval (Fitzmaurice et al. 2011).",

Bankova stated that knowledge of the chemical composition of propolis leads to a prediction of its biological activities (Bankova et al. 2005a). In general, the term biological activity describes the pharmacological activity of a substance in a living organism. However, when the therapeutic product is a complex mixture, the biological activity could be broadly based due to a multiplicity of active ingredients and thus the product could have many therapeutic indications (Jackson et al. 2007). This is the case with propolis, which contains many active components, leading to numerous pharmacological activities. Propolis has been demonstrated to be safe and non-toxic for human use. However, some cases of allergic reactions such as contact dermatitis have been reported by beekeepers. There is some variability in the toxic and safe dosages of propolis reported by different studies, probably due to a lack of standardized extraction methods (Burdock 1998). The effectiveness of propolis preparations is dependent on the method of preparation, including the solvents used during the extraction process (Silva-Carvalho et al. 2015). The following sections will give an overview of some of the biological activity studies that have been conducted on propolis samples from different parts of the world.",

The body also has natural enzymatic antioxidants, which include superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, and non-enzymatic antioxidants including lipid soluble, e.g. vitamin E, and water soluble, e.g. vitamin C and glutathione, compounds for defence against the harmful effects of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Valko et al. 2007). A free radical in the body is simply an atom or molecule containing one or more unpaired electrons in its outer orbital, such as the oxygen atom shown in Fig. 7.1. The unpaired electron allows the ROS to participate in many reactions with other free radicals. In low to moderate concentrations, ROS play vital roles in the biological processes of the human body, including stimulating pathways in response to changes in the extracellular environment (cellular signalling), mitogenic response, and immune response for defence against infections in the intracellular environment (Valko et al. 2007; Halliwell and Gutteridge 2015).\n",

            "text": "As can be seen in Fig. 7.2, oxygen molecules can accept energy in the form of electrons as an outcome of an inflammation process, leading to the production of oxygen-centred free radicals also known as ROS. The generation of ROS is regulated by the action of the enzyme RO synthase and over production results from both the mitochondrial electron transport chain and excessive production of NADH (Valko et al. 2007). Once formed, these ROS are highly reactive and produce a chain of deleterious reactions resulting in damage to cell structures (lipids, membranes, proteins and DNA) and modulation of many biological processes including inflammation and immune response. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and physiologically active antioxidant metabolites in the body (Valko et al. 2007). The excessive production of ROS may be responsible for causing a large number of diseases, such as cancer (Kinnula and Crapo 2004), cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, ROS can induce mutations or cause direct damage in DNA which leads to cell transformation and the possibility of developing a variety of malignant conditions (Valko et al. 2007). Also, active free radicals are the main factor involved in cellular aging and are responsible for the development of many CNS related medical conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases. Antioxidant agents can serve as a defensive factor against free radicals in neuronal cells (Metodiewa and Ko\u015bka 1999; Martin and Grotewiel 2006; Valko et al. 2007).\n\n\n",

The relationship between antioxidant activity and the chemical composition of propolis from different origins has been investigated by several authors (Isla et al. 2001; Kalogeropoulos et al. 2009; Mello and Hubinger 2012; Piccinelli et al. 2013). These studies confirmed that the significant antioxidant activity of propolis is related to the high content of polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, in the sample. Additionally, it has been reported that the essential oil constituents of Thymus vulgaris (thyme) could act as antioxidant agents (Deans et al. 1992). Since one of the main components of propolis has been proven to be essential oils (Bankova et al. 2014; Marcucci 1995), it might be possible that these components contribute to its antioxidant effects. The study conducted by Kumazawa et al. suggested that propolis could act as an antioxidant agent due to the presence of anti-oxidative compounds such as kaempferol and phenethyl caffeate (Kumazawa et al. 2007). Their conclusion came following the investigation of antioxidant activities of various propolis samples from different geographical origins using the DPPH assay.",

It is well known that the main factor in CNS disorders is oxidative stress. Thus, antioxidant properties play a vital role in the management of CNS disorders induced by oxidative stress. Shimazawa et al. assayed and reported the neuroprotective effect of green Brazilian propolis both in vitro and in vivo. First, the in vitro assay was conducted by exposure of neuronal cell cultures to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), followed by addition of propolis to the neuronal cells. On the other hand, the in vivo experiments studied the effect of propolis against lipid peroxidation in the forebrain of mice and DPPH-induced free radical production (Shimazawa et al. 2005). Furthermore, a recent study found that Turkish propolis contains phenolic components which have the ability to minimize DNA damage by inhibiting the effects of H2O2 in cultured fibroblasts (Darendelioglu et al. 2016). An effective natural antioxidant agent such as propolis could provide a safe and novel treatment for oxidative stress-related diseases, especially in elderly people whose conditions tend to be complex in nature and include cases of neurodegeneration corresponding to aging. In addition, propolis could play a key role in the management and prevention of various disease conditions in which ROS have a causative effect, such as some inflammatory disorders, cancer, cardiovascular and immune diseases.",

Several studies have been performed to evaluate this property against a large group of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; both aerobic and anaerobic types. The bacteria studied are summarized in Table 7.3. These bacteria were either from laboratory collections or isolated from clinical samples. The studies used propolis of different geographical origins and chemical composition, and employed different experimental approaches such as disc diffusion and disc dilution to investigate the antibacterial activity. In the disc diffusion method, antibacterial activity is determined by measuring the diameter of the bacterial growth inhibition zone in the agar layer surrounding a disc containing propolis extracts (Kujumgiev et al. 1999). The dilution method is used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) which are, respectively, the lowest concentrations that inhibit visible bacterial growth and the lowest concentration that kills bacteria (Grange and Davey 1990; Stepanovi\u0107 et al. 2003). The vast majority of antibacterial activity studies were carried out using in vitro bioassays, as mentioned above. Although the composition of propolis differs considerably depending on its botanical origin, all examined types of propolis have revealed strong antibacterial activity (Kujumgiev et al. 1999; Bankova 2005b; Bankova et al. 2007). Also, the activity of propolis may depend on the type of bee collecting it since it was found that poplar propolis collected by Apis mellifera caucasica had a higher antibacterial activity than that collected by Apis mellifera anatolica and Apis mellifera carnica (Silici and Kutluca 2005).\n",

The effect of propolis on several DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), an acyclovir resistant mutant, herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2), adenovirus type 2, VSV, and poliovirus type 2, was studied. The inhibition of poliovirus propagation was observed through a plaque reduction test and a multistep virus replication assay. At a concentration of 30 \u03bcg/ml, propolis reduced the titer of HSV by 1000, whereas VSV and adenovirus were less susceptible. The antiviral effect of propolis along with the major flavonoids found therein, such as galangin, kaempferol, chrysin, apigenin, luteolin and quercetin, against HSV was also studied. Flavonols were found to be more active than flavones, with the order of importance from least to most active being galangin, kaempferol and quercetin, demonstrating that activity increases with the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule. The efficacy of binary flavone-flavonol combinations against HSV-1 was also investigated. It was concluded that synergism might occur between two or more compounds, leading to enhanced antiviral activity of propolis (Amoros et al. 1992a).",

            "text": "Recently, attention has been focused on the antiparasitic activity of propolis since improvements on existing drugs against several tropical diseases caused by different protozoa are required. Numerous assessments have been performed using different in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate the activity of raw propolis and active compounds isolated from propolis. Accordingly, significant effects against different parasitic species including Cholomonas paramecium, Eimeria magna, Media perforans, Giardia lambia, Giardia duodenalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma evansi have been reported in the literature (Freitas et al. 2006; Falc\u00e3o et al. 2013; Bogdanov 2012; Parreira et al. 2010). Several studies have been performed that show the activity of propolis and its components against a range of protozoan parasites which cause various human diseases, including Trypanosoma brucei which causes sleeping sickness and Trypanosoma cruzi which causes Chagas disease (Higashi and De Castro 1994; De Castro and Higashi 1995; Marcucci et al. 2001; Dantas et al. 2006a, b; Salom\u00e3o et al. 2010; Falc\u00e3o et al. 2013; Almutairi et al. 2014b; Siheri et al. 2014, 2016; Omar et al. 2016). Antiprotozoal effects of different propolis samples were reported against Leishmania donovani, which causes visceral leishmaniasis, and for other strains of leishmania (Duran et al. 2008; Pontin et al. 2008; Ozbilge et al. 2010; Monzote et al. 2011; Amarante et al. 2012; Da Silva et al. 2013; Siheri et al. 2016). Recent studies have reported antiprotozoal effects of propolis extracts against Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, all of which cause malaria (Olayemi 2014; Siheri et al. 2016). Propolis is also effective against Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia, which cause intestinal infections (dysentery and diarrhoea), as well as multicellular organisms such as intestinal worms, including helminths such as Schistosoma spp., cestodes such as tapeworms, nematodes such as roundworms, and trematodes such as flukes (Freitas et al. 2006; Issa 2007; Hegazi et al. 2007; Abdel-Fattah and Nada 2007; Noweer and Dawood 2008; Alday-Provencio et al. 2015; Hassan et al. 2016). Some of the studies are described in more detail below.",

All trypomastigotes were killed within 1 h after incubation with 10 \u03bcg/ml of the extract. However, in vivo assessment of concentrations of 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg administered orally for 10 consecutive days presented no curative effect, and the rats died from the disease. However, rats treated with the two highest concentrations of propolis extract showed higher longevity than the other groups. Based on these data the study concluded that, despite the lack of curative efficacy observed in vivo at the concentrations tested, propolis extract can prolong life in rats infected with the protozoan (Gressler et al. 2012).",

Based on comparative chemical profiling, one propolis sample from southern Nigeria stood out from the others by containing prenylated isoflavonoids, which indicated that it was more like Brazilian red propolis (Zhang et al. 2014). This propolis was further investigated and ten phenolic compounds were isolated, including a new dihydrobenzofuran. All the isolated compounds were tested against T. brucei and displayed moderate to high activity. Some of the compounds tested showed similar activity against wild type T. brucei and two strains displaying pentamidine resistance. The Nigerian propolis from Rivers State showed some similarities to Brazilian red propolis and exhibited antitrypanosomal activity at a potentially useful level (Omar et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Propolis, along with other honeybee products, has been widely used as an external treatment for wounds and burns. Propolis is believed to possess antimicrobial, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects (Castaldo and Capasso 2002). These properties probably enhance cell proliferation in the skin and activate remodelling of the skin tissue. The wound healing process is a natural reaction of the body involving a sequence of several biochemical factors and multiple cellular reactions which can be divided into four stages, namely, hemostasis (blood clotting), inflammation, proliferation of new skin tissue, and remodelling of mature tissue (Gurtner et al. 2008). Hemostasis is an initial natural reaction that occurs immediately in the first few minutes of injury. During this stage, platelets in the blood accumulate at the site of injury where they release chemical signals. These signals cause fibrin, a blood protein, to form a mesh that works as a glue to bind the platelets, leading to the formation of thrombi (blood clots), which seal the injury and control bleeding. Immediately after formation of the blood clot the inflammation process starts and immune cells such as macrophages and inflammatory cells such as neutrophils secrete large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. The generated ROS arrive in the wound lesion and act as a defence system against pathogens. However, any excess amount of superoxides may damage the surrounding normal tissue, such as occurs in diabetes. The proliferative phase then occurs two or three days after the injury and involves the movement of epithelial cells until they meet each other from either migration side. This occurs via stimulation of fibroblasts in the dermis layer along with keratinocytes in the epidermis. New blood vessels start to form to provide nutrition and oxygen to repair the injured tissue. Then, proliferative fibroblasts begin to secrete matrix proteins and collagen to build up the extracellular matrix that acts as a connective tissue to form initial dermal granulation tissue. After that, the fibroblasts differentiate into myo-fibroblasts which cause contraction of the wound size due to increases in collagen synthesis relative to the proliferative process. Lastly, the remodelling and maturation phase occurs, which is characterised by scar formation as a result of replacement of type III collagen by type I collagen (Guo and DiPietro 2010; Gurtner et al. 2008). The wound healing process is illustrated in Fig. 7.4.",

It was reported that the propolis sample could potentially control the processes involved in the early phases of wound healing, including hemostasis and inflammation (Moura et al. 2011). Several studies carried out in vivo have reported that propolis activity in the management of burns apparently occurs via regulation of the immune response during the inflammatory phase (Dimov et al. 1992; Mirzoeva and Calder 1996). Another study in rats showed that the skin penetration of a topical propolis ointment formulation on cutaneous wounds depends on the healing stage and mainly stimulates the proliferation phase of wound healing by stimulating the production of keratinocytes (Sehn et al. 2009). Propolis was also reported to be useful during the remodelling and maturation phase in which it stimulated the repair of granulation cells in burnt skin tissue (Olczyk et al. 2013).",

As a result, persistent inflammation, which is frequently seen in diabetes, was prevented (McLennan et al. 2008). A recent study on wounds in a diabetic rodent model treated with a topical cream consisting of a mixture of natural products, namely: propolis, honey, royal jelly and olive oil, showed a significant beneficial effect on increasing the rate of wound healing due to antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities (Rashidi et al. 2016).",

Thus, propolis is quite potent in accelerating wound healing because of its broad-spectrum activity encompassing all wound healing phases. Along with other bee products, propolis has multiple modes of action which give it a higher possibility of therapeutic success than drugs with a single mechanism of action.",

Male BALB/c mice were treated with propolis (200 mg/kg) by oral gavage for three consecutive days. TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression was increased in the peritoneal macrophages of the propolis-treated mice. TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production were also upregulated in the spleen cells of propolis-treated mice. This suggests that propolis activates the initial steps of the immune response by upregulating TLR expression and by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice (Orsatti et al. 2010a, b).",

It was concluded that propolis exerted an immunomodulatory action in chronically stressed mice by upregulating TLR-2 and TLR-4 mRNA expression, thus supporting the immune system (Orsatti and Sforcin 2012).",

CA was found to downregulate TLR-2, HLA-DR, and CD80 and upregulate TLR-4 expression by human monocytes. High concentrations of CA inhibited both TNF-\ud835\udefc and IL-10 production, and induced a higher fungicidal activity against Candida albicans. TNF-\ud835\udefc and IL-10 production was decreased by blocking TLR-4, while the fungicidal activity of monocytes was not affected by blocking TLRs (Conti et al. 2013).",

Macrophages incubated with propolis showed a significant increase in interiorization and greater killing of parasites. Increased TNF-\ud835\udefc production was seen in mice pretreated with propolis, whereas IL-12 was downregulated during the infection.
