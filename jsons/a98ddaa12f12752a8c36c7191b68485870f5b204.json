            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic presents global challenges transcending boundaries of country, race, religion, and economy. The current gold standard method for COVID-19 detection is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application. The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving, the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based technology solutions for point-of-care diagnosis of respiratory infection, and in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . The disease, officially declared a pandemic, has infected millions of humans across the globe, and has a fatality rate between 1\u221210% in most countries. Fig. 1 shows the cummulative number of cases (and casualities) [as of May 15, 2020] , and there is still no sign of flattening. This trajecory of growth started on 11 Jan 2020, and has forced many countries to take serious containment measures such as nation-wide lockdowns and scaling up of the isolation facilities in hospitals. The lockdown is useful as it gives time for large scale testing of individuals. The gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions (from nasal or throat cavity). The results of a RT-PCR test are available in 2 \u2212 48 hours. The limitations of the testing include: (i) violation of social distancing which increases the chance of infection spread, (ii) expenses involved in the chemical reagents and devices, (iii) testing time in hours and needs expertise, and (iv) difficulty in large scale deployment. Forseeing a rise in number of COVID-19 cases, this has also led to a spur in proposals on technology solutions for healthcare. Specifically, the need for the development of simplistic, cost effective and fast testing, yet accurate methodologies for infection diagnosis has become crucial for healthcare, policy making, and economic revival in several countries. The focus is also on point-of-care diagnostic tools, technology solutions which can be deployed rapidly, pre-screening tools, and cheaper alternatives to RT-PCR test, overcoming the limitations of chemical testing. The research and the understanding of the novel virus and COVID-19 is a work in progress at various laboratories around the world. As of 16th May, the WHO and the CDC have listed dry cough, difficulty in breathing, chest pain (or pressure), and loss of speech or movement as key symptoms of this viral infection, visible between 2 \u2212 14 days after exposure to the virus. Also, a recent modeling study of symptoms data collected from a pool of 7178 COVID-19 positive individuals validated the presence of these symptoms, and proposed a real-time prediction and tracking approach [2] . Medical literature shows that speech breathing patterns are intricately tied to changes in anatomy and physiology of the respiratory system [3] . Drawn by these observations, we identify an opportunity to make impact on point-of-care diagnosis using speech and acoustics research. Bringing together a large dataset of respiratory sounds, machine learning, and respiratory infection expertise from doctors can help in evaluating the potential in using respiratory sound samples for diagnosis of COVID-19. The goal is not to replace the existing chemical testing methodologies but to supplement them with a cost effective, fast and simpler techniques. This paper presents our efforts launched along this direction.",

            "text": "Cough is a powerful reflex mechanism for the clearance of the central airways (trachea and the main stem bronchi) of inhaled and secreted material. Typically, it follows a well defined pattern, with an initial inspiration, glottal closure and development of high thoracic pressure, followed by an explosive expiratory flow as the glottis opens with continued expiratory effort [4] . The reflex is initiated by cough receptors within the central airways that are sensitive to both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Sound is generated during cough by air turbulence, vibration of the tissue, and movement of fluid through the airways [5] . This turbulence generates sound with a broadband \"noisy\" character, whose frequency content depends on the velocity, density of the gas, and dimensions of the airways from source till the mouth. A cough sound is usually composed of three temporal phases: explosive, intermediate, and voicing phase. Fig. 2 (b) shows a wideband spectrogram of a sequence of three heavy cough sound signals. Each cough lasts close to 300 ms, and the spectrum exhibits broad spectral spread over 500 Hz, 1.5 kHz, and 3.8 kHz. Interestingly, over one hundred pathological conditions are associated with cough [6] . The acoustic features of a cough sound depend on the air flow velocity as well as the dimensions of vocal tract and airways [4] . This makes it possible to detect cough sounds [7] in audio recordings. As the physical structure of the respiratory system gets altered with respiratory infections, it is even possible to classify pathological condition based on a cough sound. Pertussis is a contagious respiratory disease which mainly affects young children and can be fatal if left untreated. Pramono et. al [8] presented an algorithm for automated diagnosis of pertussis using audio signals by analyzing cough and whoop sounds. Several other recent studies have attempted to identify chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (a disease caused primarily due to smoking) [9] , and tuberclosis (an infectious disease usually caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria that affects the lungs) [10] . In addition, for respiratory disorders like asthma and pneumonia, algorithms based on cough sounds recorded using a smartphone provides a high level of accuracy [11] . For Covid-19 detection and diagnostics, the research initiatives from University of Cambridge [12] , Carnegie Mellon University [13], Wadhwani AI institute [14] and a project from EPFL [15] have already been launched. Also, a recent work by Imran et al. [16] suggests a good accuracy for cough based detection of COVID-19 using a preliminary investigation with a small number of subjects.",
