            "text": "Since the end of 2019, the world has encountered pandemic conditions attributable to a novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV 2 [[1], [2], [3]]. This is the 7th Coronavirus identified to infect the human population [1,4,5] and the first one that had pandemic potential in non-immune populations in the 21st century [6]. Finding therapeutics is thus crucial, and it is proposed to do so by repurposing existing drugs [[7], [8], [9]]. This strategy presents the advantages that safety profiles of such drugs are known and that they could be easily produced at relatively low cost, thus being quicker to deploy than new drugs or a vaccine. Chloroquine, a decades-old antimalarial agent, an analog of quinine, was known to inhibit the acidification of intracellular compartments [10] and has shown in vitro and in vivo (mice models) activity against different subtypes of Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. In 2004 it was tested in vitro against SARS-CoV [17] and caused a 99% reduction of viral replication after 3 days at 16 \u03bcM. Moreover, tests in vitro have shown inhibition of viral replication on SARS-CoV 2 detected by PCR and by CCK-8 assay [18]. Hydroxychloroquine (hydroxychloroquine sulfate; 7-Chloro-4-[4-(N-ethyl-N-b-hydroxyethylamino)-1-methylbutylamino]quinoline sulfate) has shown activity against SARS-CoV2 in vitro and exhibited a less toxic profile [19]. This drug is well known and currently used mostly to treat autoimmune diseases and also by our team to treat Q fever disease [20,21] and Whipple's disease [22,23]. In those clinical contexts, concentrations obtained in serum are close to 0.4\u20131 \u03bcg/mL at the dose of 600 mg per day over several months [24]. Clinical tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 are underway in China [25], with such trials using hydroxychloroquine in progress in the US (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04307693) and in Europe with the Discovery Trial. In this drug repurposing effort, antibacterial components have also been tested. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide, was demonstrated in vitro to inhibit cellular penetration of Ebola virus [26] and SARS-CoV 2 [26,27]. Azithromycin (azithromycin dihydrate), a macrolide, N-Methyl-11-aza-10-deoxo-10-dihydroerythromycin A, has shown antiviral activity against Zika [[28], [29], [30]]. Azithromycin is a well-known and safe drug, widely prescribed in the US, for example, with 12 million treatment courses in children under 19 years of age alone [31]. A recent study has identified these two compounds (azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine) among 97 total potentially active agents as possible treatments for this disease [32].",

Plates were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a CO2 atmosphere. Drug concentrations tested, expressed in micromoles per liter (\u03bcM), were 1, 2 or 5 \u03bcM for hydroxychloroquine associated with 5 or 10 \u03bcM for azithromycin. Each test was done at least in triplicate and repeated two times except conditions with 5 \u03bcM for hydroxychloroquine associated with 5 or 10 \u03bcM for azithromycin that were repeated a third time. Four hours before infection, cell culture supernatant was removed and replaced by drugs diluted in the culture medium. At t = 0, virus suspension in culture medium was added to all wells except in negative controls where 50 \u03bcL of the medium was added. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) was of 0.25. Then RT-PCR was done 30 min post-infection in one plate and again at 60 h post-infection on a second plate. For this, 100 \u03bcL from each well was collected and added to 100 \u03bcL of the ready-use VXL buffer from QIAcube kit (Qiagen, Germany). The extraction was done using the manual High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Life Science), following the recommended procedures. The RT-PCR was done using the Roche RealTime PCR Ready RNA Virus Master Kit. The primers were designed against the E gene using the protocol of Amrane et al. [34] in the Roche LightCycler\u00ae 480 Instrument II. Relative viral quantification was done compare to the positive control (viruses without drugs) by the 2\u2227(\u2013delta delta CT) method [35]. We performed a statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism v9.0.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA). Distribution of the data not followed a normal law. So, non parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare each combinations against positive controls using \u0394Ct between H0 and H60. Then, Dunn's test was used to correct the multiple comparison. All test was used at p = 0,05 parameter and were bilateral (two-sides) and significant P-value was indicated on Fig. 2\n. All others conditions was not significant.",

Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated in vitro to inhibit replication of SARS-CoVs 1 and 2 [17,19]. Concentrations of drugs for our study were based on the known cytotoxicity of the drugs (50% of cytotoxicity, CC 50) and their effect on microorganisms (50% inhibitory concentration, IC50). With Zika virus, azithromycin showed activity with an IC 50 range from 2.1 to 5.1 \u03bcM depending on MOI [28] without notable effect on EC 50 at high concentration [29]. The observation of efficacy of azithromycin on RNA viruses is probably shared by some other macrolides. Clarithromycin or the non antibiotic macrolide EM900 were observed as effective on rhinovirus in vitro [[36], [37]]. In vivo sulfate of hydroxychloroquine could be imply in the modulation of the immune response by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and by modification of the lysosome acidification procedure [38]. Those aspects may play a keystone role in severe cases of SARS-coronaviruses. Indeed, in mouse models from SARS-CoV pneumonia and lung affections was associated with cytokines storm [39]. In parallel azithromycin was known as inhibit the viral replication of Zika virus in vitro [29]. And in enlarge viral infection context, azithromycin was associated to up-regulate interferons I and III [30]. Concerning the respiratory syncytial virus, it was also shown that Macrolides reduce the acidity of the lysosome and by the down-regulation of the ICAM-1 protein (36). So, in the SARS-CoV 2 context, azithromycin could potentialize the effect of hydroxychloroquine by similar mechanism.",
