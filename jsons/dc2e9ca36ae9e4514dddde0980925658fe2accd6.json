Here, we characterize the oral mycobiome, including mycobiome-bacteriome interactions, in the setting of remissioninduction chemotherapy (RIC) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Oral samples (n \u03ed 299) were prospectively collected twice weekly from 39 AML patients during RIC until neutrophil recovery. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene (V4) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing were used to determine bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Intrakingdom and interkingdom network connectivity at baseline (T1) and at midpoint (T3) and a later time point (T6) were assessed via SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference). In this exploratory study, mycobiome \u2423-diversity was not significantly associated with antibiotic or antifungal receipt. However, postchemotherapy mycobiome \u2423-diversity was lower in subjects receiving high-intensity chemotherapy. Additionally, greater decreases in Malassezia levels were seen over time among patients on high-intensity RIC compared to low-intensity RIC (P \u03ed 0.003). A significantly higher relative abundance of Candida was found among patients who had infection (P \u03ed 0.008), while a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium was found among patients who did not get an infection (P \u03ed 0.03). Analyses of intrakingdom and interkingdom relationships at T1, T3, and T6 indicated that interkingdom connectivity increased over the course of IC as bacterial \u2423-diversity diminished. In (to our knowledge) the first longitudinal mycobiome study performed during AML RIC, we found that mycobiome-bacteriome interactions are highly dynamic. Our study data suggest that inclusion of mycobiome analysis in the design of microbiome studies may be necessary to optimally understand the ecological and functional role of microbial communities in clinical outcomes. IMPORTANCE This report highlights the importance of longitudinal, parallel characterization of oral fungi and bacteria in order to better elucidate the dynamic changes in microbial community structure and interkingdom functional interactions during the injury of chemotherapy and antibiotic exposure as well as the clinical consequences of these interrelated alterations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "the core set of oral mycobiome taxa previously identified among healthy individuals, which includes Candida, Cladosporium, Saccharomycetales, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Cryptococcus, and Malassezia (22, 23) . Although Aspergillus was seen in at least one oral sample in over 70% of the patients, it had a detectable abundance in only 13% of all longitudinal samples. Additionally, among the samples which had a detectable abundance of Aspergillus, the median relative abundance was only 1.8% (interquartile range [IQR] , 0.03% to 8.4%). This observation was interesting given that Aspergillus is the primary cause of invasive mold infection among patients with hematologic malignancy (24) . The abundances of the top ten most abundant genera showed significant intrapatient and interpatient variability across time (Fig. 1) . However, the \u2424-diversity appeared to be more homogeneous within each patient across time, with the mean intrapatient Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between samples within the same patient being 0.649 among the cohort members versus an average interpatient \u2424-diversity value of 0.745 for all samples across time points. This is consistent with another study that analyzed the oral mycobiome stability over 30 days, which revealed high interindividual diversity and yet indicated intraindividual stability (25) . Using the results of principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA) shown in Fig. 2 , we found no distinct grouping by patient or time point based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. We next sought to describe the oral mycobiome changes over the course of RIC. Through mixed-effects models, we found that mycobiome \u2423-diversity did not significantly change over time (Chao1, P \u03ed 0.4639; Shannon, P \u03ed 0.8049; Simpson, P \u03ed 0.6637) (Fig. 3) , unlike what has been previously been noted for the bacteriome, where diversity decreased from baseline until neutrophil recovery among leukemia patients receiving RIC (2, 26) . Mycobiome characteristics correlate with chemotherapy subtype and antifungal administration. We next sought to determine if mycobiome profiles were associated with clinical variables among the patients in the cohort, to include chemotherapeutic or antimicrobial administration. In this sampling of patients, 72% were on high-intensity chemotherapy, while 28% received low-intensity chemotherapy (Table 1). The majority of patients (44%) received fludarabine-based regimens, with the majority of the regimens being FIA (idarubicin, cytarabine, and fludarabine) or FLAG-Ida (fludarabine, idarubicin, and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor). Twenty-eight percent of patients received nonfludarabine high-intensity regimens, which typically included CIA (idarubicin, cytarabine, and clofarabine)-based, IA (idarubicin and cytarabine)-based, or CLIA (cladribine, idarubicin, and cytarabine)-based regimens. Patients also receive hypomethylator-based treatments (such as decitabine or azacitadine) (13%) or other low-dose therapies to include LDAC (low-dose antimetabolite cytarabine)-based regimens (14%). Given the uneven sampling time (time to neutrophil recovery) among patients, we evaluated the mycobiome structure and composition at the baseline (T1), a midpoint (T3), and a later time point (T6), common among most patients. At T6, patients who received low-intensity RIC had significantly higher mycobiome \u2423-diversity than patients who received high-intensity RIC (observed operational taxonomic units [OTUs], P \u03ed 0.02; Shannon, P \u03ed 0.054) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Although Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated that the relative abundances of the five most abundant fungal genera did not significantly differ between the four different chemotherapy subtypes at any single time point (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), we did determine chemotherapy subtypes to be significantly associated with the relative abundance of specific taxa over time. Specifically, patients who received high-intensity chemotherapies experienced a decrease in Malassezia abundance over time (P \u03ed 0.003, Fig. 4 ). This effect was not seen in other taxa analyzed (data not shown). To our knowledge, the changes in the oral mycobiome occurring as a result of chemotherapy have been studied only in regard to their role in chemotherapy-induced mucositis in the setting of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in mice and humans (13, 14) . In patients, although the authors expected chemotherapy to affect the oral mycobiome, no major changes in the composition of fungal communities were observed (13) . Thus, our study would be the first to show specific changes in the oral mycobiome associated with chemotherapeutic intensity and type.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "(22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 199, "end": 202, "text": "23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 509, "end": 514, "text": "[IQR]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 680, "end": 684, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1325, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1921, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1922, "end": 1925, "text": "26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4376, "end": 4380, "text": "(13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4381, "end": 4384, "text": "14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 4545, "end": 4549, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 811, "end": 819, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1401, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1748, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3479, "end": 3486, "text": "Fig. S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3735, "end": 3743, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 4036, "end": 4042, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "We next sought to determine if antimicrobial administration resulted in significant mycobiome changes during RIC for AML.

We analyzed the later time point during RIC (T6) given that all antimicrobials analyzed were administered by T6 and that it was the latest time point common among most patients. Surprisingly, there was no significant association between the relative abundance of the top 5 most abundant fungal taxa at time point 6 and receipt of specific antimicrobials (Tables S2 toS7) . However, amphotericin B seemed to have a significant effect on the composition of the oral fungal community over time. Patients who received amphotericin B experienced an increase in the relative abundance of Fusarium over time (P \u03ed 0.034) (Fig. 5 ). There is biological plausibility to this observation inasmuch as Fusarium species are associated with high amphotericin B MICs (27) .

In light of the complex interplay between fungal populations and opportunistic bacterial pathogens (28), we sought to determine the relationships between the mycobiome and infections in AML patients during RIC. A total of 23% of patients had a microbiologically defined infection with a positive bacterial culture, which included mostly bacteremia or urinary tract infections (Table 1) . We also considered the 31% of patients who had a clinically defined infection, such a pneumonia or cellulitis, in the absence of positive culture in our analysis. In analyzing the three major time points (T1, T3, and T6), we found that the relative abundance of Candida at T3 was significantly higher in patients that contracted microbiologically or clinically defined infections prior to neutrophil recovery (P \u03ed 0.008), while there was a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium (P \u03ed 0.03) at T6 in those that did not develop an infection prior to neutrophil recovery (Fig. 6) . These results were corroborated using the LefSe (linear discriminant analysis of effect size) algorithm, where Candida was more differentially abundant at T3 among patients who developed an infection prior to neutrophil recovery (Fig. S2) and Fusarium more abundant at T6 among patients who did not have an infection (Fig. S3) .

P values are derived from Mann-Whitney test. Some of the intrakingdom and interkingdom interactions have been previously observed. Specifically, Malassezia and Candida are often coisolated from infectious samples from the skin infections (29) and onychomycosis (30) , but to our knowledge cooccurrence has not been shown in the oral cavity. Interestingly, we found a negative correlation between Malassezia and Candida at T1 and T3 in the oral cavity. In a study of the oral microbiome of HIV patients versus uninfected individuals (31), it was found that Cladosporidium and Rothia had a positive correlation in uninfected individuals. We observed the same cooccurrence at T6 in treated leukemia patients. Also, in individuals uninfected with HIV, there was a negative correlation between Aspergillus and Prevotella (31) . We observed the same cross-domain connection, but as a cooccurrence. In the same study, the authors observed cocolonization of Cladosporidium and Pichia in uninfected individuals (31) , which is a fungal relationship that we detected at T3.

Some fungus-bacterium interactions in the oral cavity of diseased and healthy individuals (namely, Candida-bacterium interactions) have been intensely studied; however, interactions of bacteria with other known fungal inhabitants of the oral cavity have yet to be described. Thus, the impact of fungus-bacterium interactions in the oral cavity and on overall health is not completely understood. Although this exploratory study had a relatively small sample size and assessed only oral samples, the data shown here still highlight the dynamic nature of mycobiome and bacteriome communities and their interactions over the course of RIC. Unfortunately, the study design did not include information on diet, the metabolic milieu (e.g., other relevant comorbidities such as diabetes), oral health information (including oropharyngeal candidiasis), or occurrence of mucositis. These clinical factors/outcomes could potentially account for the heterogeneity seen within the data or might also be associated with specific mycobiome or bacteriome compositions/relationships. Despite not includ-ing a comprehensive record of clinical covariates, we were able to determine that specific changes in the mycobiome community structure appear to have clinical consequences in terms of bacterial infections. Moreover, interkingdom dynamics are likely driven by changes in the mycobiome due to chemotherapy intensity and subtype, as well as bacteriome changes driven by antibiotic exposures. Although this report highlights the underappreciated complex and dynamic nature of the cross-kingdom interactions that occur over time and result from the stress of chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy, these data are limited by our having used only marker gene analysis (16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 2 [ITS2] sequencing) to identify bacterium-fungus dynamics. Target gene analysis is limited in its ability to differentiate individual taxa, specifically to lower taxonomic levels such as the species level. Although the ability to assemble and differentiate fungal reads at the whole-genome level is currently restricted by the number of fungal genomes available in public databases, this information could be vastly improved in the future via shotgun metagenomics sequencing, particularly in regard to functional pathway analysis. An alternative approach would be to layer on metabolomics or metaproteomics to understand the functional consequences of bacterial and fungal changes as well as the interkingdom metabolic pathway interactions. Again, however, methods for data integration of shotgun metagenomic and metabolomics data, particularly in regard to cross-domain networks, are still in their infancy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FIG 6"}, {"text": "Conclusions.
