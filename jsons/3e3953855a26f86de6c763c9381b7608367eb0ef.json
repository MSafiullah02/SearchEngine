Ultimately, these kinases, and the cellular signaling pathways that they exploit, may serve as therapeutic targets for treating patients. Currently, small molecule inhibitors of kinases are under investigation as therapy for herpes viral infections. Additionally, a number of cellular or host-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have been previously FDA approved for cancer treatment are under study in animal models and clinical trials, as they have shown promise for the treatment of various viral infections as well. This review will highlight the wide range of viral proteins phosphorylated by viral and cellular kinases, and the potential for variability of kinase recognition sites within viral substrates to impact phosphorylation and kinase prediction. Research studying kinase-targeting prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for a number of viral infections will also be discussed.",

            "text": "Phosphorylation events are ways in which infectious agents can exploit cellular signaling pathways for their own replication and propagation benefits [4] . Upon a viral infection, a number of cellular signaling pathways (including the MAPK and Jak/STAT pathways) utilize cellular phosphorylation events stimulated by viral proteins [5, 6] . For example, WNV infection of microglial cells is associated with an increase in p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK phosphorylation [7] . This phosphorylation and activation of the p38 MAPK and ERK pathways may induce chemokine and cytokine production in WNV-infected microglial cells [7] . EBV LMP1 activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, as LMP1 expression induces the phosphorylation of Akt; this signaling pathway is involved in the actin cytoskeleton reorganization of EBV-infected cells [8] . There are many ways that viral infections can induce and/or inhibit cellular signaling pathways, but it is clear that one common mechanism is through the phosphorylation of cellular and viral proteins. This review will focus on medically relevant animal viruses. Phosphorylation of plant viral proteins is covered in various recent articles and reviews [9, 10] . Here, we summarize various topics relating to phosphorylation during the course of medically relevant viral infections. The variation in kinase recognition motifs in viral proteins, the phosphorylation of nonprotein small molecules in viral therapies, and the study of kinase inhibitors for use as treatments for poxviruses and herpesviruses will be highlighted. Table 1 lists kinases that have been demonstrated to phosphorylate viral proteins in a number of medically relevant viruses. The table includes viruses encoding proteins that were phosphorylated in an isolated experimental system by a single, identified kinase. Although evidence such as phosphorylation/kinase prediction data and kinase inhibitor data is also very useful, this table includes only viral protein substrates that were experimentally phosphorylated by purified and/or isolated kinases. For those viruses listed as having proteins phosphorylated by an \"unknown kinase\" in Table 1 , the viral proteins were shown to be phosphorylated, but biochemical data have not yet identified the kinase responsible. The table is representative of kinases that have been found to phosphorylate viral proteins and demonstrates the extensive role that phosphorylation plays in medically relevant viral infection, if not 100% inclusive of the published literature. Viral phosphorylation events in Table 1 were found through PubMed literature searches by using the search terms \"(specific virus)+kinase\" and/or \"(specific virus) + phosphorylation.\"",

            "text": "Once specific phosphorylation sites of viral proteins are identified, mutational analyses are necessary to determine any potential phenotypic effects of a specific phosphorylation. For example, the HIV-1 protein p6, which contains the late domain involved in virus budding, was determined to be a phosphoprotein phosphorylated by multiple kinases [11] . Further analysis identified a specific phosphosite (Thr23) that was phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by the MAPK, ERK-2 [12] . When Thr23 was mutated to an alanine (thus blocking phosphorylation of the site) within the virus, the mutant showed reduced infectivity as well as defective viral particle maturation and budding [12] . Further work is necessary to determine more precisely how exactly the Thr23 phosphorylation is leading to the observed effects on the virus, but this example highlights the ability of phosphorylation at a specific site on a viral protein to impact a viral life cycle. As a caveat, when performing mutational analyses, it is important to ensure that the non-phosphorylatable mutant protein is stably expressed to similar levels as the wild-type protein to more clearly associate phenotypic effects to the absence of a specific phosphorylation.",

A number of kinases, including CKI and CKII, phosphorylate the HCV NS5A protein and contribute to NS5A's hyperphosphorylated form [15, 16] , although in this specific case, CKI and CKII phosphorylate different sites within NS5A. Although both of these phosphorylations may be involved in transitioning the viral protein from genome replication to particle assembly, the sites are distinct [16] . Although the aforementioned in vitro data are helpful in the preliminary identification of kinases, in vivo experiments must also be performed to determine if multiple kinases are in fact phosphorylating a viral protein in an infected cell. By utilizing multiple kinases to phosphorylate a viral protein, a virus could have the ability to expand its host and cellular tropism and infect different species and cell types with varying kinase profiles. Additionally, kinase redundancy provides multiple opportunities for a viral protein to be phosphorylated, ensuring the chance for the phosphorylated protein to induce pathogenic effects on the cell.

In the mouse though, this less specific inhibition may not be helpful, as will be discussed later [17] .

However, the importance of phosphorylation in the viral life cycle can be investigated even without the identity of kinase(s).

For example, CKII has been shown to phosphorylate proteins from nearly 50% of the viruses listed. CDKs are also utilized by a number of viruses. The use of CDKs by viruses is understandable, as kinases regulating the state of cellular growth and replication would seem to be an obvious target for viral manipulation. have all displayed an ability to autophosphorylate, although the full effects of these autophosphorylations on protein activity remain under investigation. As reviewed in Michel and Mertens [49], HCMV UL97 is autophosphorylated, but there are conflicting data regarding the role of this autophosphorylation in UL97's ability to phosphorylate and interact with other proteins. It is not definitively known whether autophosphorylation of viral kinases will induce the same effect(s), such as regulating catalytic activity and recruiting proteins for interaction, as autophosphorylation of cellular kinases. Evidence comparing the autophosphorylation of a specific site between homologous cellular and viral (Rous sarcoma virus) Src kinases suggests that the effects of a specific autophosphorylation could differ between even related cellular and viral kinases [39, 50] . Further studies are necessary to determine how autophosphorylations of viral kinases affect these proteins' activity, structure, and function. Viral proteins may be phosphorylated at \"non-canonical\" kinase recognition motifs Many kinases have characterized recognition motifs substrate sequences that are phosphorylated most efficiently by a particular kinase. A number of motifrecognition programs, such as NetPhosK [51] and Scansite [52], have been developed to predict phosphorylation sites and kinases involved on the basis of substrate sequences. Although very useful, these search engines cannot account for some factors such as a cellular localization signal distant from a kinase substrate site that might sequester an otherwise perfectly good substrate away from a kinase. Some, but not all, of the research cataloged in Table 1 was aided by bioinformatic queries to try to identify specific phosphorylation sites within viral proteins, but for all of the references listed in Table 1 , there are experimental data supporting that phosphorylation of viral proteins occurred as well. Because a great deal of research has been performed in identifying cellular substrates of kinases [53-56], it is worth noting any variation in the amino acid sequence of kinase recognition sites between cellular and viral substrates that still allows for phosphorylation of the viral substrate.",

Ser67 lacks a phosphorylated residue at the \u00c03 position and a string of three to four acidic residues, so the Ser67 phosphorylation site deviates from the ideal CKI recognition site [57] . As such, neither NetPhosK nor Scansite programs recognize Ser67 as a potential phosphorylation site, let alone a site able to be phosphorylated by CKI. Likewise, the vaccinia virus A36R protein is able to be phosphorylated at Tyr112 by both Src and Abl tyrosine kinases [21] . However, the Tyr112 site does not sit within a canonical Abl kinase recognition site, as it lacks a proline or phenylalanine at the +3 position. Both NetPhosK and Scansite predicted that only Src would phosphorylate A36R Tyr112. In another example of kinase recognition site variation among related viruses, protein kinase G (PKG) phosphorylates DENV NS5 protein [60], YFV NS5, and WNV NS5 [61] at two sites that both differ substantially from the canonical PKG substrate sequence, R-K-R-K-S/T [62]. The flaviviral PKG sites additionally differ from each other, with no clear motif to be identified from these viral substrates ( Figure 1 ). Curiously, while DENV Thr449 and YFV Ser450 sites are both phosphorylated by PKG within the same C-X-T/S-C motif [60], NetPhosK analysis does not predict any Thr449 phosphorylation in DENV NS5 but correctly predicts a PKG phosphorylation of Ser450 in YFV NS5. It is possible that kinases may bind substrates in sites distant from the recognition motif where phosphorylation occurs. These distant binding sites may be Whereas Scansite's recognition of potential kinase recognition motifs is based on experiments identifying optimal sequences surrounding phosphorylation sites within a peptide substrate library [63], NetPhosK is a neural network-based program. Thus, NetPhosK's criteria for identifying a phosphorylation site and the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation are not easily defined by the programmers or users. Despite the variations from known recognition sequences and/or phosphorylation prediction analyses, biochemical and cell culture data suggest that all of the sites discussed earlier can be phosphorylated by the kinases in question. Thus, although programs such as these provide a good starting point for studying phosphorylation of a viral protein, one must use caution when predicting phosphorylation patterns and the kinases involved in phosphorylating viral substrates as there can be substantial differences between actual and predicted phosphorylations/ kinases. Detection of specific phosphorylations has become easier in recent years because of advancements in phosphopeptide enrichment chromatography that is compatible with mass spectrometry [64] . Overall, various other experimental methods, including phosphospecific antibodies and mass spectrometry, are necessary for more rigorous identification of in vivo viral (and cellular) site-specific protein phosphorylations [65,66].",

On the other hand, because cidofovir is not phosphorylated by viral kinases, mutations in these kinases do not affect cidofovir's efficacy. Additionally, mutations in DNA polymerases can alter the nucleoside analogue's inhibition of DNA synthesis, inducing resistance to the nucleoside analogue treatment [80-82].

Phase II studies showed treatment efficacy in HIV, HCMV-coinfected patients, as well as a role in prophylaxis in stem cell transplant patients [86] , but a phase III study was unable to show superiority of a maribavir prophylaxis strategy over a pre-emptive therapy with valganciclovir or ganciclovir [87] .

Adsorption of a rabbit poxvirus (myxoma virus) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular CCR5 receptor and the tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak2 [105] . Reducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was also associated with a decrease in myxoma viral replication [105], suggesting a role in poxviral replication for these tyrosine kinases as well. Peptide mimetics of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) inhibit the tyrosine kinases Jak2 and ErbB-1 [106].

Sirolimus and everolimus are serine/threonine kinase inhibitors of the cellular mTOR kinase. KSassociated herpesvirus (also known as human herpesvirus 8) can cause neoplastic hypervascular lesions in both immunocompromised and, rarely, immunocompetent patients infected by the virus. This is particularly common in patients with HIV (20 000\u00c2 the rate of the general population) or after a solid organ or bone marrow transplant patient (500\u00c2 the rate of the general population). Although no single approach to treating KS has become universally accepted, before 2004 it was common practice in transplant patients who developed KS to limit the use of immunosuppressants, leading to the resolution of some, but not all, KS-related disease. A complete stop in immunosuppression, though, left patients vulnerable to graft rejection. In 2004/5, two groups [110,111] reported a series of patient as well as accompanying animal and tissue data suggesting that switching a solid organ transplant patient's post-transplant immunosuppressive cocktail from a cyclosporine-based regimen to one that included sirolimus (rapamycin) resulted in a complete resolution of their biopsyproven KS lesion. Subsequent reports (reviewed by Stallone et al. [112] ) suggest that other mTOR inhibitors (everolimus) have the same effect and that mTOR inhibition plays an important role in the resolution of KS, although the degree to which the mechanism is less immunosuppression versus blockage of phosphorylation event(s) remains a subject of research. Mechanistic data included in these reports though do show that endothelial cells from KS tumors have upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor FLK-1/KDR and that mTOR inhibitors block the interaction of VEGF with FLK-1/KDR and limit the cellular response to VEGF.",

Some of these kinase inhibitors have cost and toxicity issues that must be taken into account if research into their utility as antivirals is to be undertaken. Nevertheless, as the efficacy of sirolimus and everolimus has demonstrated, kinase inhibitors could have a role to play in combating viral infections.",

These kinases phosphorylate viral protein substrates and small non-protein molecules and promote the initiation and continuation of cellular signaling pathways. Many medically relevant viruses have evolved to exploit the activity of these kinases to promote viral replication. Thus, these cellular and viral kinases may serve as targets for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments of viral infections. Kinase-inhibitory compounds have previously been successful in treating various cancers, and research is ongoing to determine these drugs' efficacies in treating viral infections. ",

Although there is some sequence conservation between viruses at each site, the sequences surrounding each individual site (449/452/450 versus 38) differ from each other, as well as from the canonical PKG recognition motif.

            "text": "Poxviral proteins are phosphorylated by a number of cellular tyrosine kinases(Table 1). Src-family and Abl-family tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the vaccinia viral membrane protein A36R[21,91]. The phosphorylation of A36R in cell-associated enveloped virions induces actin tail formation[91,92], allowing viral motility toward the cell surface. Abl-family tyrosine kinases are involved in the detachment of cell-associated enveloped virions from actin tails, leading to the formation of extracellular enveloped virus[17]. Extracellular enveloped viruses are hypothesized to be involved in viral dissemination throughout an infected organism[93]. These effects of cellular tyrosine kinases on viral motility and release are conserved in variola and monkeypox viruses as well[17,19,93].Because of the importance of tyrosine kinases in poxvirus replication, ongoing studies are examining the ability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors to serve as treatments for poxviruses. Since the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gleevec (STI-571, imatinib mesylate) firsttransformed treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia over a decade ago [94,95], a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in use as therapies for cancers [96-99]. In cells infected with poxviruses (vaccinia [17,21], variola, and monkeypox [19]), Gleevec inhibits the Abl family of tyrosine kinases [100] and reduces poxviral extracellular enveloped virus release. Prophylactic treatment of vaccinia-infected mice reduced viral loads in ovaries at 4 days postinfection and increased survival among lethally challenged mice [17]. Therapeutic treatment with Gleevec at 24 and 48 h post-infection likewise increased survival among vaccinia-infected mice (although efficacy decreased as the time between infection and treatment increased) [19]. Additionally, treatment with Gleevec reduced viral dissemination to distal tissues in mice infected intranasally with vaccinia [19]. Sprycel, an inhibitor of both Src-family and Abl-family kinases, strongly inhibited extracellular enveloped virus formation and release in cell culture. However, unlike Gleevec, Sprycel (dasatinib) had minimal effect on mouse survival and in vivo viral load, possibly because of effects on the spleen and/or bone marrow caused by the drug's Src inhibition [19]. Poxviruses encode epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors, which interact with the EGF receptor (EGFR, ErbB-1) [101]. The virally encoded EGF-like growth factors activate ErbB-1's tyrosine kinase activity to induce downstream signaling cascades that promote viral replication [102]. An FDA-approved small molecule inhibitor of ErbB-1 tyrosine kinase activity, IRESSA (gefitinib), decreased viral-induced ErbB-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation [102]. IRESSA's effect on ErbB-1 activation and its downstream effects on ERK1/2 were correlated with a decrease in in vitro vaccinia viral infection [103] and viral spread, indicated by a dose-dependent decrease in vaccinia plaque number and size [102]. IRESSA is FDAapproved, but its efficacy in inhibiting poxviral replication has yet to be demonstrated in a mammalian system. Other inhibitors of ErbB-1's kinase activity, while not yet FDA approved, have been studied in mice. Such inhibitors include the 4-anilinoquinazoline family, which includes the small molecule inhibitor Canertinib (CI-1033) [104]. Canertinib reduced variola and vaccinia extracellular enveloped virus formation and/or release in cell culture [104]. In vivo, prophylactic treatment with canertinib showed modest effects in increasing vaccinia-infected mouse survival, reducing viral titers in the lung, and augmenting the immune response (increasing levels of IL-1b, IL-1Ra, and IFN-g) [104]. Combining canertinib chemotherapy with immunotherapy (anti-L1R (Vaccinia protein) antibody treatment) enhanced these effects, especially in post-infection treatments [104].",

These nucleoside analogues are first phosphorylated by viral kinases [67,69] and subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases [72] to form nucleoside triphosphates. The nucleoside triphosphates are incorporated by viral DNA polymerases into the nascent DNA strands, leading to chain termination in the case of acyclovir [73] and internucleotide incorporation in the case of ganciclovir [74]. Overall, the nucleoside analogues inhibit viral DNA replication and thus decrease herpesviral replication [71,75]. Cidofovir, another nucleoside analogue that inhibits herpesviral replication, is only phosphorylated by cellular kinases before being incorporated into viral DNA and terminating the DNA chain [76,77]. Different nucleoside analogue drugs have varying efficacies in inhibiting specific herpesviruses.
