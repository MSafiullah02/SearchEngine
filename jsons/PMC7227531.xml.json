Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 employs the host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the main host receptor for cellular entry [6]. Previous experimental studies showed a higher level of ACE2 expression in salivary glands, as compared to that in the lungs [7] and that the epithelial cells lining salivary gland duct were early target cells of SARS-CoV infection in rhesus macaques [8]. SARS-CoV was also detected in saliva samples [9]. This suggested that the salivary glands could be a potential target for SAR-CoV-2 infection, and hence saliva could be a potential sample for SARS-CoV-2 detection.",

A recent study that detected the virus from multiple sites showed a lower test positivity rate from the nasal swab (63%), as compared to the BAL fluid (93%) [15]. Therefore, a lower detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva, as compared to BAL fluid among severe cases might be possible. Of interest, two specimens had detectable SARS-CoV-2 from saliva samples, but not from nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Of these two samples, the Ct values of the ORF1ab and N genes were 33.9 and 34.8, respectively in one specimen, and 36.2 and 33.7, respectively in another specimen. These two cases later reported having anosmia. Therefore, the results of these tests could represent a true infection. The yield of the saliva specimen as a complementary diagnostic test for COVID-19 needs further study.",

We prospectively collected data on consecutive patients who were at high risk of COVID-19 including those with acute respiratory symptoms and having risk factors, thus minimising potential spectrum effect. In addition, all enrolled patients were verified with the reference standard. As for the limitations, our study only focused on saliva testing among symptomatic patients under investigation but the spectrum of the disease ranges from asymptomatic, upper respiratory tract symptoms, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [16, 17]. Therefore, the performance of the saliva test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic persons remains unknown. In addition, the number of COVID-19 cases in our study was limited due to a decline in the number of cases in Bangkok, since April 2020.",
