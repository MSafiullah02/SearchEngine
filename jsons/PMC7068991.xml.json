Given the likelihood of morbidity or mortality, palliative and end-of-life care should be routinely considered in the ICU [3]. As such, the World Health Organization has described palliative care as \u201can approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness\u201d [4]. The physician should be thus aware of the patient and family needs to improve the management of physical, psychological and spiritual symptoms. Additionally, being aware of the value of palliative care services to help meet the families\u2019 and patients\u2019 needs and align therapy to the prognosis of the patient balanced with their preferences and values [4, 5].",

As example, the usefulness of several scores (e.g. the APACHE score) is mainly validated at the ICU admission, when the patients\u2019 responsiveness to intensive care treatments is not clear yet. Other scoring systems (e.g. the SOFA score) are well validated to monitor the organ dysfunctions over time in the ICU; nevertheless, the requirement of biochemical data for the scoring calculation may limit their routine use/daily application [7]. Finally, the requirement for, and to what degree, palliative care should be integrated with intensive care for all ICU patients is often not objectively defined and instead determined by individual physician\u2019s perspective [11, 12].",

Combining this with the fact that an ENDING-S score does not require any laboratory data as the SOFA score does, ENDING-S can be calculated every day, easily, on each patient.

Thus, a prognostic tool only based on SOFA score would not change, failing to alert the physician to the increasing amount of palliative and end-of-life care required for that patient. On the other hand, as ENDING-S is influenced by the progression of days spent in the ICU, it increases over time even in absence of clinical changes.

Interestingly, an objective definition of end-of-life status is still lacking in clinical practice, even for patients who are not hospitalized [8]. For this reason, as in other papers [20, 21], the outcome observed at the ICU discharge has been used as a surrogate for end-of-life condition for patients both enrolled in the pilot study and for those enrolled in this prospective validation. Notably, despite death in the ICU certainly being associated with the end-of-life of patients, ICU survival does not necessarily exclude the end-of-life condition or the requirement of palliative care [22].
