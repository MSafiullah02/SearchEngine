In the 15th century, early writings describing preventive inoculations against the smallpox virus began to appear in China.3 However, it wasn\u2019t until the pioneering work of Adolf Mayer, Dimitri Ivanovsky, and Martinus Beijerinck, with the tobacco mosaic virus in the early 1900s, that viruses were recognized as distinct pathogenic microorganisms.4 Throughout history, viruses have primarily played a detrimental role in human health. The smallpox and influenza viruses caused worldwide epidemics resulting in millions of deaths.5 To prevent the spread of the aphthovirus pathogen responsible for foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease, millions of animals were slaughtered resulting in significant economical losses.6 Recently, the SARS coronavirus made headlines when an outbreak spread rapidly across the world in near\u2010pandemic fashion killing 11 % of infected individuals.7 Also, the highly pathogenic influenza A virus, subtype H5N1, often known as avian influenza virus, is a potential pandemic threat and has become a major global concern.8 The world witnessed the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the 1980s. Since then, HIV infection leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become a global crisis of catastrophic proportion infecting nearly 2.6 million new individuals per year.9 There are effective treatments for HIV and AIDS that can slow the course of the disease, but there is no cure or vaccine to date.",

Among them, the HIV protease enzyme was quickly recognized as an important therapeutic target.16 It has been demonstrated that an effective HIV protease is essential to the production of mature, infectious HIV virions.17 Logically, inhibition of the HIV protease became the subject of much pharmaceutical research. Subsequent drug\u2010development efforts led to the advent of the first generation of protease inhibitors (PIs) marking a new era in AIDS chemotherapy.18 The use of PIs in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors proved to be an extremely effective treatment regimen which suppresses viral reproduction and reduces the possibility of viral mutations.19 Despite their early success, PIs were plagued with several drawbacks including low metabolic stability, poor bioavailability, debilitating side effects, and drug toxicity.20 Perhaps the most concerning obstacle has been the rapid development of drug\u2010resistant viral strains which render the PIs ineffective.21 Currently, 40\u201350 % of the patients who achieve initial viral suppression will eventually experience treatment failure.22 Additionally, these drug\u2010resistant viral strains can be transmitted to new individuals.23 Success in the future management of HIV/AIDS depends on the development of new antiviral agents that maintain efficacy against drug\u2010resistant viral strains.",

Antiretroviral treatment creates a new selection pressure resulting in the amplification of drug\u2010resistant strains.

Additionally, Gag and Gag\u2010Pol may co\u2010evolve with the protease incurring mutations that enhance their ability to be processed by the mutant protease.46, 47 Ultimately, ten or more mutations can accumulate resulting in viable viruses with resistance to multiple drugs.",

Fundamentally, for drug resistance to occur, viral mutations must arise that diminish drug binding but retain viral fitness. Mutations that occur within the active site or result in structural distortions are limited because they produce impaired proteolysis of the natural polyprotein substrates.43, 44 This was reinforced during our reviews of X\u2010ray structures of mutant HIV\u20101 proteases which revealed the structural changes associated with drug\u2010resistant mutants.51, 52 Based upon this backbone\u2010binding strategy, we have focused our molecular design efforts on promoting extensive hydrogen\u2010bonding interactions with the protein backbone atoms contributing to the S2\u2013S2\u2032 subsites. The S1 and S1\u2032 subsites are largely formed by hydrophobic residues, while both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues contribute to the S2 and S2\u2032 subsites.53 In addition, we planned to fill the hydrophobic pockets throughout the protease active site and thus further limit the ability of the virus to develop drug resistance.

            "text": "Investigations into the factors controlling enzyme activity have revealed that protein structure and enzyme function are closely related.54\u201356 Most enzymes are proteins consisting of strands of amino acids combined to form distinct polypeptide chains. These proteins fold spontaneously, generating local secondary structures (\u03b1 helix, \u03b2 strands, etc.) that lead to the formation of a defined three\u2010dimensional (3D) tertiary structure. With many enzymes, multiple protein chains combine through noncovalent interactions forming a quaternary structure possessing multiple subunits. Protein structures are stabilized by a collection of weak intramolecular forces that can be disrupted and reformed allowing a limited range of dynamic movement. The folding process creates cavities near the surface of the enzyme that may serve as substrate binding sites. Interestingly, a relatively small volume of the overall enzyme constitutes the active catalytic site with the remainder of the protein serving as a structural scaffold.57 For effective catalysis to occur, the amino acid residues within the active site require a specific 3D configuration in which the transition state of the chemical reaction can be attained more readily than in the absence of the enzyme.58\u201360 Perturbations of this configuration can have a deleterious effect resulting in a loss of catalytic function.

            "text": "HIV\u20101 protease is an aspartic protease containing two catalytic aspartic acid residues in the active site that share an acidic proton and interact with a water molecule in the absence of a substrate or inhibitor. The catalytically active enzyme is a homo dimer and each monomer comprises 99 amino acids. The active site is formed by two catalytic aspartic acids and each residue is located in each domain (monomer). The scissile bond of the peptide substrate is in close proximity to the active site. A pair of flaps, one from each monomer, is located at the entrance to the active site.61 The flaps fold down over substrates upon binding and act as a solvent shield that excludes water and creates a local environment conducive to catalysis. The flaps are flexible, showing an open conformation in the apoenzyme.53, 62 The peptide substrate contains at least seven residues extending from P4 to P3\u2032, where the scissile bond lies between P1 and P1\u2032. The side chains of the substrate lie in subsites S4 to S3\u2032 formed by protease residues. Hydrophobic residues occupy the S1 and S1\u2032 subsites, and hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues can be accommodated by the S2 and S2\u2032 subsites. A series of conserved hydrogen\u2010bonding interactions connect the backbone of the protease and the substrate and serve as a major contribution to binding affinity.63 These interactions are shown in Figure 1. The X\u2010ray structure of HIV protease bound to the peptide analogue of the p2/NC cleavage site (PDB code 2AOD) demonstrates these interactions.64 A number of amino acid residues in the active site, such as Asp25, Gly27, Ala28, Asp29, and Gly48, are highly conserved; therefore, inhibitor design strategies targeting these residues have led to potent PIs.50, 65\u201368\n",

These structural comparisons provided insight into the molecular design strategy for combating drug resistance as reviewed recently.50 Mutations can be divided into two main categories. First, mutations of active\u2010site residues can directly alter protease interactions with an inhibitor, as shown by examples of mutants containing I84V or I50V that reduce interactions with a number of PIs.69\u201371 Alternatively, distal mutations can act indirectly to diminish protease stability and interactions with an inhibitor, as shown for mutants with L24I, F53L, and L90M.70, 72, 73 The majority of these mutants show minimal changes in the backbone structure around the active site. Even the flexible flaps generally show changes of less than 1 \u00c5 for the backbone atoms. One exception is mutation V82A, which produces shifts in the loop comprising residues 79\u201382 with compensating hydrophobic contacts.71, 73, 74 The loop can adjust by 1\u20132 \u00c5 to accommodate the different\u2010sized hydrophobic groups at P1 and P1\u2032 of the inhibitors.75 As depicted in Figure 2, even structures of drug\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 proteases with 10\u201314 mutations, and HIV\u20102 protease which differs in about 40 different residues, superimpose with only a minimal deviation in the backbone atoms around the active site.51, 76\u201379 Mutations producing drug resistance cannot significantly alter the overall structure of the active site that is essential for protease function. Viable mutant strains will show minimal distortions in the structure of the protease active site as expected in order to maintain catalytic activity and viral replication fitness.50, 52 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that inhibitors that maximize hydrogen\u2010bonding interactions with backbone NH or C=O atoms in the active site would retain these interactions in viral mutants. Therefore, these compounds would maintain potency despite viral mutation, providing a viable solution to the problem of drug resistance in HIV\u20101 treatments. Using this original design concept, we have actively designed and synthesized a variety of inhibitors that form extensive binding interactions with the protease backbone and are capable of maintaining efficacy against panels of clinically relevant drug\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 viral strains.50, 67, 68, 80\n",

It maintained significant antiviral activity (6\u201312\u2010fold change) similar to darunavir. Furthermore, 11 was evaluated against PI\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 variants and was found to have a unique antiviral activity profile (Table 7). Against the PI\u2010resistant variants, cross\u2010resistance to APV was observed. Interestingly, SQV and ATV remained active against viral strains selected against 11 which contain the A28S mutation. This was linked to TMC\u2010126 resistance and resulted in a significant loss in fitness of the protease.113\n",

This PI (15) displayed an excellent resistance profile.121, 122 It exhibited a mean 6.2\u2010fold change in EC50 values (range 0.6\u201326 nm) from the wild\u2010type HIV.

Towards a possible explanation of this marked resistance suppression, it was proposed that the phosphonate moiety acted as an anchor point in the solvent medium and enhanced the degeneracy of the binding state of the inhibitor by providing favorable entropic compensation following protease mutations.

This effort led to the design of a stereochemically defined bicyclic hexahydrocyclopentanofuran (Cp\u2010THF) as the P2 ligand. Incorporation of this ligand in the hydroxyethylaminosulfonamide isostere provided a series of exceptionally potent PIs.51 We positioned the cyclic ether oxygen in the Cp\u2010THF ring to form hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH groups of Asp29 and Asp30. As can be seen in Figure 16, replacing the bis\u2010THF in darunavir with a new Cp\u2010THF ligand provided inhibitor 22, which exhibited sub\u2010nanomolar enzyme inhibitory potency nearly ten times less than that of darunavir (K\ni=16 pm). We believed that binding of the Cp\u2010THF ligand in the S2 subsite was distinct from the bis\u2010THF ligand and may have caused a slight shift in position of the remainder of the inhibitor structure within the active site.51 We then speculated that modifications of the P2\u2032 aniline could allow improved interactions with the NH groups of Asp29\u2032 and Asp30\u2032 in the S2\u2032 subsite. As shown, we have incorporated a hydroxymethylsulfonamide as the P2\u2032 ligand and the resulting inhibitor 23 showed a 30\u2010fold improvement of enzyme inhibition (K\ni=4.5 pm) compared to 22. In addition, it has shown very impressive antiviral potency (IC50=1.8 nm) similar to that of inhibitor 10. In order to probe the importance of the Cp\u2010THF ring oxygen, we synthesized inhibitor 24 in which the oxygen is replaced with a methylene group. Interestingly, 24 displayed a more than 1100\u2010fold loss of enzyme inhibitory potency compared to 23. Furthermore, 24 exhibited a drastic loss in antiviral activity (IC50>1000 nm).

The P2\u2032 hydroxy group forms a strong hydrogen bond to the backbone NH group of Asp30\u2032and a water\u2010mediated contact with the side chain oxygen of Asp30\u2032. The ring oxygen of the P2 Cp\u2010THF ligand forms a strong hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of Asp29 and a weak hydrogen bond with Asp30. These interactions cannot occur for inhibitor 24 which lacks the ring oxygen and this may explain why 24 is significantly less potent than 23.

We next explored a 1,4\u2010dioxane P2 ligand; the resulting inhibitor 28 exhibited a significant reduction in antiviral potency. A larger trioxepane system also provided a less active PI.

We explored the incorporation of stereochemically defined 2\u2010pyrrolidinone and oxazolidinone functionalities so that the pyrrolidinone NH group could form a hydrogen bond with Gly27\u2032 and its carbonyl group could interact with Arg8\u2032 in the S1\u2032 site.131 Our initial plan was to examine the potential of the new P1\u2032 ligand in combination with Cp\u2010THF and bis\u2010THF ligands. We also wanted to address the question of whether enhancement of backbone\u2010binding interactions would lead to PIs with improved drug\u2010resistance profiles. The results of this investigation are summarized in Figure 22. Inhibitor 33 with (S)\u2010methyl\u20102\u2010pyrrolidinone as the P1\u2032 ligand showed good enzyme inhibitory potency but its antiviral IC50 value was 230 nm.

The design of PIs using the concept of maximized backbone binding has led to PIs characterized by high potency against both wild\u2010type and multidrug\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 strains.50\n",

An analysis of the X\u2010ray structure of darunavir\u2010bound HIV\u20101 protease (Figure 9) revealed that the bis\u2010THF ether oxygens are involved in hydrogen\u2010bonding interactions with the amide N\u2010H groups of Asp29 and Asp30 at a distance of 2.9 and 3.1 \u00c5, respectively. We conceptualized that incorporation of a larger ring system might promote closer more effective hydrogen bonding to these backbone residues and result in a more favorable alignment between the cyclic ether oxygen and the Asp30 amide N\u2010H bond. These factors might result in stronger hydrogen bonds and higher affinity inhibitors. In addition, a larger ring size may promote favorable hydrophobic interactions within the S2 subsite and allow additional flexibility to better accommodate steric changes caused by protease mutations. Therefore, we synthesized and evaluated a series of PIs containing a tetrahydropyranyl\u2010THF (Tp\u2010THF) P2 ligand.134 As shown in Figure 26, consistent with bis\u2010THF, the bicyclic ligand in 39 (GRL\u20100476) with its 4S configuration is more effective than the epimeric ligand. Like the bis\u2010THF ligand, both cyclic ether oxygens are critical for binding as their respective replacement with methylene groups resulted in a significant loss in potency. We have also prepared PIs 40 and 41 incorporating a p\u2010methoxybenzyl side chain as the P1 ligand and p\u2010methoxysulfonamide and p\u2010aminophenylsulfonamide as the P2\u2032 ligands, respectively.

Our initial academic pursuit was focused on addressing the question of whether we could design natural product derived ligands or templates that could mimic the biological mode of action of peptide bonds and alleviate problems inherent to peptide\u2010based drugs. Nature has been optimizing various cyclic ether/polycyclic ether templates for millions of years in various biological microenvironments involving biosynthetic enzymes. Inspired by nature and based upon X\u2010ray structures of protein\u2013ligand complexes, we invoked the idea of designing stereochemically defined cyclic ether or polyether\u2010like molecular features to replace peptide bonds and effectively fill the hydrophobic pockets in the active site of HIV\u20101 protease. We envisioned positioning cyclic ether oxygen to mimic the biological action of a peptide carbonyl group and the cyclic functionality would make necessary van der Waals interactions in the hydrophobic pocket. These research efforts led to the creation of a variety of conceptually novel molecular templates that are entirely nonpeptidic but interact with HIV\u20101 protease with remarkable affinity. Our many X\u2010ray structural studies of inhibitor\u2010bound HIV\u20101 proteases provided strong evidence that such a cyclic ether/polyether oxygen indeed serves as an effective mimic of the carbonyl of a peptide/amide functionality.

We were interested in optimizing inhibitor structures against wild\u2010type HIV\u20101 protease as well as against known mutant proteases. This objective led us to examine X\u2010ray structures of inhibitor\u2010bound wild\u2010type HIV\u20101 proteases as well as the X\u2010ray structures of a number of mutant proteases. Superimposition of these X\u2010ray structures evidenced only minimal distortion of the backbone conformation. This led to our proposition of targeting the protein backbone as a strategy to evade drug resistance. By maximizing hydrogen\u2010bonding interactions with the protein backbone, we have essentially created a \u201cmolecular crab\u201d capable of latching on and holding tightly in the enzyme active site. Using the combination of our in\u2010depth antiviral studies, along with drug\u2010resistance, and X\u2010ray crystallographic studies, we have documented the practicality and usefulness of the backbone\u2010binding design strategy to combat drug resistance. The combination of our ligand\u2010design efforts inspired by polyether natural products, and subsequent inhibitor design efforts targeting the protease backbone to combat drug resistance, culminated in the discovery and ultimate development of darunavir, the first FDA\u2010approved treatment for patients with multidrug\u2010resistant HIV\u20101 variants.
