Within the GI tract, much of these substances are solubilized and further degraded enzymatically to simple molecules, sufficiently small in size and in a form that permits absorption across the mucosal epithelium.

In other species, the initial step in utilization of triglycerides occurs in the lumen of the proximal small intestine, where hydrolysis is catalyzed by pancreatic lipase. The pancreas secretes lipase in active form. The enzyme requires an oil-water interface for activity, so only emulsions of fat can be hydrolyzed. Enzyme activity is directly related to the surface area of the emulsion, so the smaller the emulsion particle, the greater the total surface area of a given quantity of triglyceride and the greater the rate of hydrolysis ( Benzonana and Desnuelle, 1965 ) . Bile salts are not an absolute requirement but favor hydrolysis by their detergent action, which causes formation of emulsions with small particle sizes and by stimulating lipase activity within the physiological pH range of the duodenum.

Both compounds are relatively insoluble in water but are brought rapidly into micellar solution by the detergent action of bile salts. The mixed micelles so formed have a diameter of approximately 2 nm and are believed to be the form in which the products of fat digestion are actually taken up by the mucosal cell ( Hofmann and Small, 1967 ) . The intraluminal events that occur in fat absorption are schematically summarized in Figure 14-6 . b . Mucosal Phase The initial step in intestinal transport of fat is the uptake of fatty acids and monoglycerides by the mucosal cell from micellar solution. The precise mechanism is yet unclear, but present evidence suggests that the lipid contents of the micelle are somehow discharged at the cell surface and enter the mucosal cell in molecular rather than micellar form ( Isselbacher, 1967 ) . The net effect is the absorption of the end products of lipolysis and the exclusion of bile salts, which are absorbed farther down the intestine, primarily in the ileum. Uptake of fatty acids appears to be a passive process having no requirement for metabolic energy. Within the mucosal cell, the fatty acids are transported by a soluble binding protein to the endoplasmic reticulum, where the fatty acids and monoglycerides are rapidly reesterified to triglyceride ( Ockner and Isselbacher, 1974 ; Ockner and Manning, 1974 ) . The two biochemical pathways for triglyceride biosynthesis in the intestine are summarized in Figure 14 -7 . Direct acylation of monoglyceride occurs in the intestine and is the major pathway for lipogenesis in the intestine during normal fat absorption. The initial step in this series of reactions involves activation of fatty acids by acyl-CoA synthetase, a reaction that requires Mg 2 \u03e9 , ATP, and CoA and that has a marked specificity for long-chain fatty acids. This specificity explains the observation by Bloom et al. (1951) that medium-and short-chain fatty acids are not incorporated into triglycerides during intestinal transport but enter the portal circulation as nonesterified fatty acids. The activated fatty acids then react sequentially with monoand diglycerides to form triglycerides in steps catalyzed by mono-and diglyceride transacylases. The enzymes responsible for this series of reactions are present in the microsomal fraction of the cell ( Rao and Johnston, 1966 ) .

Phosphatidic acid phosphatase then hydrolyzes the phosphate ester bond, forming diglyceride, and by means of a transacylase step similar to that described previously, triglyceride is formed. Although this pathway appears to be of minor importance for triglyceride synthesis in the intestine, intermediates in this sequence of reactions are important in the synthesis of phospholipids, which are essential for stabilization of the chylomicron. The next step in fat transport is formation of chylomicrons within the endoplasmic reticulum. The chylomicron is composed primarily of triglyceride and has an outer membranous coating of cholesterol, phospholipid, and protein ( Zilversmit, 1965 ) . The \u03b2 -lipoprotein component of the chylomicron is synthesized by the intestinal mucosal cell.

The blood level of vitamin A is independent of liver reserves, and, as long as a small amount of vitamin A is present in the liver, the blood level remains normal ( Dowling and Wald, 1958 ) . In diets that lack animal fat, the carotenes, primarily \u03b2 -carotene, serve as the major precursor of vitamin A. The intestinal mucosa has a primary role in conversion of provitamin A to the active vitamin, although conversion can occur to a limited degree in other tissues. The mechanism involves central cleavage of \u03b2 -carotene into two active vitamin A alcohol molecules that are subsequently esterified and absorbed by the lymphatics as with preformed vitamin A.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 329, "end": 355, "text": "( Dowling and Wald, 1958 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "b .
