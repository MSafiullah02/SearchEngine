This method displays recombinant peptides or proteins on the surface of phage particles, which can then be selected for (\u2018panned\u2019 for \u2013 Figure 1\n) by enabling the phage to interact with selected immobilized ligands. The power of phage display lies in its ability to: (i) maintain a physical link between the displayed protein and the DNA sequence encoding it; and (ii) screen libraries containing billions of unique peptides and proteins. Escherichia coli filamentous phage of the Ff class including strains M13, fd and f1 have been extensively used to develop and exploit this technology. These phage are composed of a circular single-stranded DNA genome that is encased in a long tube composed of thousands of copies of a single major coat protein, with four additional minor capsid proteins at the tips (Figure 2\n).",

However, the characteristics of the filamentous phage life cycle has limitations for the display of proteins, the properties of which prevent the correct transfer of the hybrid capsid protein across the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane of E. coli\n[4]. Alternative bacteriophage display systems have been developed using bacteriophage such as T4, T7, \u03bb [4] and P4 [5], which have lytic life cycles so that the proteins of the phage capsids are assembled and folded in the cytoplasm rather than being secreted through the membrane [4].",

Hence, most phage libraries of cDNA fragments are constructed in alternative display systems. However, a modified filamentous phage display system based on the high-affinity interactions between the Jun and Fos leucine zipper proteins was developed by Crameri and Suter [6]. In this system, the Jun leucine zipper protein is fused to the N terminus of the pIII coat protein so that the Jun protein is displayed on the surface of the phage, and the cDNA libraries are cloned as a C-terminal fusion to the Fos leucine zipper protein [8]. The pIII-anchored Jun protein is bound by the soluble Fos fusion in the periplasm, thus, the cDNA-encoded protein is bound indirectly to pIII.",

            "text": "There are two types of phage display library: random peptide libraries (RPLs) and natural peptide libraries (NPLs). The repertoire of peptides displayed in RPLs is encoded by synthetic random degenerate oligonucleotide inserts 9, 10, 11 and these libraries have been extensively used to identify linear antigenic epitopes (see later). The advantage of this type of library is their universal nature, which enables many applications of each library. The main disadvantage of RPLs is that, because of the way in which they are constructed, peptide sequences that are not found within the antigen or intact pathogen can be displayed [12]. By contrast, NPLs are constructed from randomly fragmented DNA from the genomes of selected organisms such as pathogenic microbes. Thus, the phage particles in these libraries display fragments of natural proteins. Although the majority of clones in NPLs are nonfunctional (only one in 18 clones will be correctly in frame with the vector sequences: one clone in three will start correctly, one clone in three will end correctly and one clone in two will be in the correct orientation), peptides or proteins selected from NPLs are more successful in eliciting an antibody response that crossreacts with the native intact pathogen than those selected from RPLs [13]. Therefore, NPLs provide important alternatives to RPLs for applications such as the identification of vaccine components and, recently, have been used effectively in the identification of bacterial adhesins (see later).",

The Plasmodium parasite completes its life cycle in the mosquito and it is this interaction, rather than that of the human host, that has been investigated by Ghosh et al.\n[20]. Because the development of the Plasmodium parasite in the mosquito involves the crossing of both midgut and salivary gland epithelia, this study investigated the hypothesis that such trafficking requires specific host\u2013pathogen interaction. A phage display library of random dodecapeptides fused to the N terminus of phage coat protein VIII was injected into Anopheles, followed by dissection of the organs of interest and elution of bound phage. A 12-residue peptide from the eluted phage was identified and designated \u2018salivary gland and midgut peptide 1 (SM1)\u2019 [20]. This peptide strongly inhibited Plasmodium invasion of salivary-gland and midgut epithelia, thereby hindering the development of the parasite in Anopheles. This study illustrates another variation of phage display technology \u2013 the use of phage display libraries to investigate specific phage-binding targets within the whole organism. In vivo panning was first described by Pasqualini and Ruoslahti [21], who isolated phage-displayed peptides that bound to vascular beds in vivo. To date, there are limited reports of such in vivo panning but this could have an important future role for the identification of specific tissue receptors for microbes or their products.",

The development of vaccines against this organism must take into account that antibiotic treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa infections rarely results in clearance of the bacterium. This is in contrast to treatment of early P. aeruginosa infections in which the bacteria can be eradicated [30]. Antigens expressed early in P. aeruginosa infections of CF patients were investigated by panning an RPL against sera from non-infected and infected patients [31]. In conjunction with gene-array data and bioinformatic analysis, this study identified several genes that encode secreted proteins and outer-membrane proteins that are potential targets for vaccine development against P. aeruginosa infection [31]. Alterations in the panning technique used, such as subjecting the library to initial negative selection, further increases the potential uses of these libraries. Gnanasekar et al.\n[32] constructed a T7 phage display library of the cDNA of the parasite Brugia malayi (a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis). To ensure that the clones of interest (i.e. those binding to infection-specific antibodies) were enriched, the phage library was first subjected to three negative-selection steps using non-infected human sera followed by a positive-selection step using sera from patients infected with B. malayi. Further experiments revealed that one of the five antigens identified using this strategy, B. malayi NIP3-like protein, conferred protection against challenge infections in animal models [32].",

Panning of a scFv library against purified severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) identified two antibody fragments that bind to SARS-CoV with high specificity [33]. These could potentially be used in the development of detection assays for the virus or to elucidate potential vaccine candidate antigens. Phage-display scFv libraries have also been used successfully to develop immunodiagnostic and detection methods for microbial products or spores. One of the most impressive aspects of these applications is the high specificity of selected clones for the microbe. For example, panning of a scFv library against spores of Bacillus subtilis resulted in the selection of clones that bound to only one of 11 spore strains [34]. Similarly, clones selected from a phage display scFv library screened against Clostridium difficile toxin B were highly specific and showed no cross-reactivity with strains of C. difficile that are toxin-B negative. The single-chain antibody could also be used to detect as little as 10 ng of toxin B when used in ELISAs [35].",

The application of shotgun phage display to the identification of bacterial virulence factors has been further extended by Frykberg and colleagues, with the development of phagemid vectors that only enable the display of bacterial exported proteins 47, 48. Many exported microbial proteins are adhesins, enzymes or toxins, all of which might have a role in pathogenicity.",

However, despite these limitations, the success of this method is obvious considering the numbers of shotgun phage display libraries that have been used to identify novel genes that encode putative bacterial receptins and protein binding domains (Table 2). Use of this technique identifies multiple microbial genes encoding proteins that potentially interact with the host in a single panning experiment and such results provide a starting point to determine the importance of various bacterial genes in pathogenesis. It is likely that phage display NPLs will become even more widely used in the study of infectious diseases, particularly because the growing number of available bacterial genomes means that the DNA fragments that encode phage-displayed peptides and proteins can be easily mapped to a particular bacterial gene.",

This technique has many advantages: the link between phenotype and genotype, the enormous diversity of variant proteins displayed within a single library and the flexibility of selection that can be performed in vitro or in vivo. Earlier limitations on this technique (such as the unsuitability of pIII- or pVIII-based filamentous phage display systems for the display of cDNA coding for peptides or problems with protein conformation) have been circumvented by continual development of the technology. The versatility of phage display means that it can be adapted easily to many different areas of research, as highlighted by the variety of biological questions to which phage display has been applied. It has yielded interesting and important results in the study of infectious diseases, not least in epitope mapping, the identification of potential vaccine candidates and bacterial adhesins. However, the vast potential of phage display is such that there are many more ways of applying the technology to these areas of research. There is certainly scope for developing new strategies to identify host receptors for microbial products by panning in vivo in animal models or against ex vivo tissues or organs. There are numerous examples of synergistic relationships between opportunistic bacteria that could be examined by panning phage display libraries against each other to investigate interactions between microbes. Perhaps the most exciting potential use of phage display in the study of infectious diseases is in comparative genomics. The number of sequenced microbial genomes has increased greatly in the past ten years and continues to do so as more genomes are sequenced. This will enable detailed bioinformatic analysis of genes identified by panning of NPLs and a comparison of the genes implicated in pathogenicity between groups of closely related bacteria.",
