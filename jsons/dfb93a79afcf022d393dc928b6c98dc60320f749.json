This study reports on a viral surveillance program in Taiwan from 2005 to 2006 with sampling conducted in poultry slaughterhouses. The genetic features of the obtained field isolates were investigated using sequence analysis and SimPlot analysis. A 1-directional neutralization test was performed to examine the antigenic variations among the collected viruses. The selection pressures that may contribute to the evolution of Taiwan IBV during recent decades were assessed.

Another isolate demonstrated the incorporation of China-like and H120-like genome fragments within the S2 gene and the membrane protein (M) gene region, respectively. Some antigenic changes were found in the 1-directional neutralization test. However, no positive selection pressures were related to those variations in the S1 genes among Taiwan IBV. Based on our work, we suggest that sampling chickens in poultry slaughterhouses is an effective and valuable means of compiling viral prevalence data, particularly in situations where there is subclinical infection.

The respiratory tract is the primary target of virus infection, whereas the urogenital system, including the kidneys and the oviducts, is also affected. Young chickens infected with IBV can acquire permanent damage to their oviducts. Older infected chickens may exhibit poor feed efficiency (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Cavanagh, 2007) . Infectious bronchitis virus has great economic importance owing to its effects on egg-laying performance and meat production (Cook, 2002) .",

According to Roussan et al.

However, this assay may not be able to discriminate between disease and vaccine strains. A higher IBV detection rate may be found in investigations with samples or flocks that were analyzed because of suspected IBV infection. In this study, the tracheas of slaughtered chickens were collected in poultry slaughterhouses, where sampled chickens were inspected and found to be apparently normal. Biased sampling was therefore avoided. The data obtained from our study may cover subclinical infection circumstances and may represent a more factual disease status.

A decade ago, local IBV were molecularly characterized and found to belong to 2 populations (TW-I and TW-II) based on the RFLP of the S1 gene (Wang and Tsai, 1996) . However, local IBV are continually evolving. Infectious bronchitis virus 3374/05 was previously characterized as a natural recombinant between the Taiwan-and China CK/CH/LDL/97Itype strains, and frequent recombination events have been observed in several progeny strains (Chen et al., 2009) . The 13 reported IBV in this work were molecularly characterized. Among them, most isolates (11/13, Figure 2 . Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the partial nucleocapsid (N) gene from the infectious bronchitis virus isolates recovered in this study (\u2022). The phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA version 4.0 by the neighbor-joining method (bootstrapping for 1,000 replicates, bootstrap value >70%). TW = Taiwan group; Mass = Massachusetts.

However, phylogenetic analyses revealed that isolate 3382/06 clustered with the TW-I group based on the S1 gene but not based on the N gene. To identify the recombination site, a fragment covering the 3\u2032 end of the structural protein gene region, about 6.8 kb in length, was further investigated. We determined the viral sequences using at least 4 identical results from sepa-rate RT-PCR products. The results obtained from the interpretation programs were supported by statistical evidence. Surprisingly, in addition to the first crossover with the CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains in the S gene, there was an abrupt shift in nucleotide identities among the M, 5a, 5b, and N genes, strongly indicating another recombination event. This second recombination event was between isolate 3382/06 and strain H120. Two putative H120-like recombinants have also been reported Figure 3 . SimPlot analysis of isolate 3382/06. The 1171/92 strain (pink), the H120 strain (green), and the China strain CK/CH/LDL/97I (deep blue) were used as putative parental strains. The similarity plot displays the consecutive nucleotide identity (%) from the spike glycoprotein (S) gene to the nucleocapsid (N) gene among the queried strain and parental strains. The genomic scale was given at the top of the plot. Isolate 3382/06 was identified as an intertypic recombinant among the 3 putative parental strains. The 2 recombination breakpoints were indicated in red. P-values were calculated by the \u03c7 2 test.

In this study, we schematically present the crossover events in the plot, and the genome positions of the putative recombination sites are readily observed. This was the first observation of vaccine virus genome incorporation into wild-type IBV in Taiwan. For a decade, due to the lack of proper homologous protection against local viruses, disease prevention in Taiwan relied on a cross-protective effect conferred by heterologous Mass-type strains such as M41 and H120. In particular, live attenuated viruses are widely used to vaccinate many chicken types. Viruses were likely shed and now circulate in the field. Furthermore, isolate 3381/06 was closely related to the American group strains, another heterologous vaccine type approved in Taiwan. More challenging problems may arise if multiple genome incorporation events occur among viruses. Thus, the crucial observation from this study alerts the need for reconsideration of the policy of IBV control. Indeed, 2 local IBV vaccines have been developed for this purpose (Huang and Wang, 2006) .",

Mutations in the S1 gene may alter the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the virus (Lai and Holmes, 2001) . To address the relationship between the selection pressures and the long-term genetic variations in Taiwan IBV, nearly all available S1 gene sequences from local viruses were collected and analyzed. Compared with the average d S /d N ratio of 1.6 previously obtained in the molecular characterization of Italy 02 genotypes in Spain (Dolz et al., 2006) , our data, which showed average d S /d N ratios of 4.27 (TW-I) and 3.34 (TW-II), were not suggestive of a high rate of nonsynonymous changes in Taiwan IBV. No positive selection pressures might drive the evolution of the 2 Taiwan IBV genogroups. Alternatively, there was evidence of purifying selection. These observations may be explained by the fact that current heterologous vaccine strains offer only partial protection and may not drive many nonsynonymous substitutions in amino acid sequences in local viruses.",

The results showed that no cross-neutralization effect was achieved between isolate 3374/05 and 2 groups of local viruses as well as the Mass type, suggesting that isolate 3374/05 is a new serotype in Taiwan. Isolate 3382/06 possessed the same serotype as its S1 gene-homologous TW-I strains. Therefore, chickens infected with those variants were probably not protected by the current IBV prevention program. However, the disease history of the infected flocks from which variants 3374/05 and 3382/06 origi-nated was unavailable. The pathogenicity of those variants awaits further study.",
