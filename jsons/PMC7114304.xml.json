Since the early 70s, viruses have played a pivotal role in the discovery and structural characterization of the RNA cap (Fig. 1\n), as well as in the mechanistic elucidation of the RNA capping pathway. Incidentally, virus families for which these discoveries were made (Reoviridae and Poxviridae) use an RNA capping pathway that turned out to be the same as that of their eukaryotic hosts. Soon after these discoveries, other virus families were found to deviate substantially from this \u2018conventional\u2019 pathway (see below).",

The 5\u2032-triphosphate is first hydrolysed by an RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase (RTPase). A guanylyltransferase (GTase), also called \u201ccapping enzyme\u201d, adds the cap structure under the form of a guanosine 5\u2032-monophosphate in a 5\u2032\u20135\u2032 orientation. The cap is then methylated onto the N-7 position of its guanine by an RNA cap guanine N-7-methyltransferase (N-7 MTase). This generates the minimal cap-0 (m7GpppN\u2026), found in metazoan and lower eukaryotes. In higher eukaryotes, further methylation by ribose 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases (2\u2032-O MTases) occurs at the 2\u2032-position of the riboses of the original transcript to yield mainly cap-1 (m7GpppNmN\u2026) but also cap-2 (m7GpppNmNmN\u2026) structures.",

Viruses generally replicate in the cytoplasm, causing there to be a time-window during which viral RNAs are synthesized but not yet capped. Virus and cell co-evolution has generated a number of cellular pathways and proteins involved in sensing the presence of viral RNAs. The absence of RNA cap as well as the presence of double stranded RNA are strong tokens for a viral infection. These RNA species, alone or together, are detected as \u201cnon-self\u201d RNA by cellular sensors triggering an innate cellular immunity response (Koyama et al., 2008, Takeuchi and Akira, 2007, Wilkins and Gale, 2010).

The question of whether the in vitro inhibition effectively leads to a significant block of viral growth must be answered. One has to consider the two major mechanisms of action of the viral target. It can be an enzyme, and inhibition of its enzyme activity may have exponential consequences. On the other hand, the virus may develop alternative pathways in order to resist antiviral molecules. For example, Flavivirus capping inhibitors had to be validated since dengue virus was also shown to perform cap-independent translation of its RNA genome (Edgil et al., 2006). Another possibility is that the target protein can be a binding partner devoid of catalytic activity and part of a protein\u2013protein binding equilibrium. Its inhibition would shift the equilibrium according to the law of mass action. The protein dosage must be fine tuned to exert a powerful antiviral effect. In both cases, a significant effect on viral growth must be observed to validate the target as appropriate.",

For example, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) incorporate several thousand nucleotides to produce a single RNA genome. Inhibition of the viral RdRp at each nucleotide incorporation should exhibit a powerful antiviral effect. In contrast, RNA capping events can vary from a single capping event (e.g., the genome of ss(+)RNA viruses), to many RNA capping events (e.g., Nidovirales, Mononegavirales, etc.). Nevertheless, the connection between RNA capping and antiviral innate immunity pathways is expected to amplify any drug action on RNA capping. Immature or incomplete RNA caps may not only exhibit an altered expression profile, but may also be detected by a variety of innate immunity sensors that add another direct negative effect on viral growth. In this context, it is noteworthy that the efficacy of RNA capping inhibition has been demonstrated. The inhibition of Flavivirus MTase, which catalyzes two methylations per synthesis of an entire RNA genome, has been reported to be able to completely suppress viral replication (Dong et al., 2008a).",

It was soon discovered that other viruses also used \u2018unconventional\u2019 RNA capping reactions deviating from the conventional RNA capping scheme (example in Fig. 3\nand for complete review (Decroly et al., 2012)). Nevertheless, it is truly remarkable that several of these widely different RNA capping reactions and pathways converge to the same RNA cap structure (Fig. 4\n). This observation indicates that the evolutionary pressure to keep this structure protecting RNA must be significant. Viral RNA capping is thus an interesting target for drug design.

In that respect, the least neglected RTPase is cvRTP1, from the DNA Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1. Not surprisingly, phosphate analogues (see Fig. 6, RTPase inhibitor I and II, also vanadate) are weak inhibitors, with no \u201cdrug-like\u201d properties (Takagi et al., 2003). The family of Flavivirus NS3-like enzymes may have greater value, since in addition to the RTPase activity they habour two other activities (helicase and NTPase). The RTPase active site is super-imposable to the NTPase active site, which provides energy to unwind dsRNA. Suppression of the RTPase/NTPase activity abrogates helicase activity, therefore, it is likely that bi-functional inhibitors will be discovered in the near future (Lescar et al., 2008). One example for this approach has been a study of the inhibitory potential of purine analogues (one structure in Fig. 6, RTPase inhibitors III) that are expected to inhibit all three activities (Despins et al., 2010).",

In the case of DNA viruses, the enzyme shares structural and functional similarities to the ligase protein superfamily, raising potential difficulties in achieving selectivity inside the host cell. The pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet (a phosphonic acid derivative (Fig. 6, GTase inhibitor I)) has been shown to inhibit the reaction, not surprisingly since the reaction produces pyrophosphate (Souli\u00e8re et al., 2008). In the case of several viral families the GTase is still unknown (coronaviruses, flaviviruses). In the flaviviruses, the GTase activity might be expressed by the N-terminal domain of protein NS5 carrying also other related RNA capping activities (MTases, Issur et al., 2009b). Therefore, structural and mechanistic studies may provide efficient drug leads targeting several activities at once as it is the case for Ribavirin, a guanine nucleotide analogue, targeting GTase and MTase (Benarroch et al., 2004a, Bougie and Bisaillon, 2004).",

            "text": "The exploration of MTases constitutes the most actively growing field amongst viral RNA capping targets. The last 10 years have seen viral RNA cap MTases coming increasingly into focus as targets for the discovery and development of antivirals (Dong et al., 2008b, Issur et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2010). The inhibition of N-7 MTase activity is expected to exert a deleterious effect on viral replication because it blocks viral RNA translation. The essentiality of the N-7-methylation for viral replication has clearly been demonstrated for several viral families (Almazan et al., 2006, Dong et al., 2008a, Ray et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2007). In contrast, mutational analysis indicates that 2\u2032-O MTase inhibition has weak effects on virus replication in cell culture (Ray et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2007). Nevertheless, 2\u2032-O MTases are now also considered as potential targets due to the demonstration that RNA, lacking 2\u2032-O-methylation on their cap structure, induces antiviral response through the MDA5 sensor (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). Viruses mutated in their 2\u2032-O MTase gene accordingly show strongly reduced replication capacity in animal models (Daffis et al., 2010). This has led to a re-evaluation of the importance of 2\u2032-O-methylation (reviewed in (Decroly et al., 2012)).",

Another early study described inhibition of N-7 MTase and 2\u2032-O MTase activities of VV by 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligo(adenylic acid) triphosphates (Sharma and Goswami, 1981).

The dengue virus 2\u2032-O MTase activity was shown to be inhibited by the GTP-analogue ribavirin triphosphate (Benarroch et al., 2004a), sinefungin, and SAH (Selisko et al., 2010). Based on known complex structures of the dengue virus NS5 MTase domain (Benarroch et al., 2004a, Egloff et al., 2007, Egloff et al., 2002) which define the RNA cap binding sites during 2\u2032-O-methylation and N-7-methylation (the latter being the actual active site) as well as the SAM-binding site, several groups have employed virtual screening and docking procedures to identify potential ligands and thus inhibitors (Lim et al., 2011, Luzhkov et al., 2007, Milani et al., 2009, Podvinec et al., 2010). Some molecules were found to present inhibitory activity in the micromolar range in in vitro enzymatic assays (Luzhkov et al., 2007, Milani et al., 2009, Podvinec et al., 2010), see example in Fig. 6, MTase inhibitor IV). A new conserved hydrophobic binding pocket next to the SAM-binding site was identified on Flavivirus MTases, which is critical for viral replication and cap methylations (Dong et al., 2010). This invites to the design of SAM analogues that also interact with this adjacent hydrophobic site and should be thus more potent and specific in comparison to SAM analogues as sinefungin. High-throughput screens using MTase activity assays and GTP-binding assays were set up and used to identify inhibitor molecules (Geiss et al., 2011, Lim et al., 2008). Concerning Coronavirus MTases the search for antivirals has been less active. Some SAM analogues have been tested and found to inhibit the N-7 MTase activity of nsp14 and the 2\u2032-O MTase activity of nsp16 in the low micromolar range (Bouvet et al., 2010). One of the identified molecules, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA, (Fig. 6, MTase inhibitor III)), also inhibits SARS-CoV replication in infected cells (He et al., 2004). An indirect approach to inhibit viral MTases is being considered for Coronavirus 2\u2032-O MTase nsp16, the activity of which depends on its interaction with the nsp10 protein (Bouvet et al., 2010, Decroly et al., 2011, Lugari et al., 2010). Molecules that disrupt the interaction are expected to inhibit the MTase activity of nsp16 and thus viral replication. This approach can also be considered for the N-7 MTase activity of protein D1 of VV, which depends on the activation by the stimulatory protein D12 (De la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2007).",

The most potent compounds of respective series have been used to elicit resistance and the resistance mutation map to an L region or domain consistent with the presence of the PRNTase.

The latter served as a control compound with moderate antiviral effect in the discovery of PRNTase inhibitors, but the precise mechanism of action of ribavirin (i.e., capping, error catastrophe, IMP dehydrogenase, or else (Leyssen et al., 2006, Severson et al., 2003, Zhou et al., 2003)) against Mononegavirales remains to be investigated.",

Remarkably, the compounds exhibited IC50 values in the micromolar range, comparable to IC50 values observed when purified polymerase cores were used in an in vitro endonuclease assay. The following chemical diversification of the parent compound could achieve a high specificity for influenza. Indeed, the L-735,882 compound reached an IC50 value of 1.1 \u03bcM for influenza in an in vitro endonuclease assay and an IC50 value of 2 \u03bcM in a viral titer assay using influenza virus infected cells. The La Crosse virus, a Bunyaviridae for which RNA capping and RNA polymerase priming rely also on cap snatching, remained unaffected both at the enzyme and virus level. Interestingly, the La Crosse virus replicates in the cytoplasm exclusively, unlike the influenza virus. Therefore, RNA caps are likely snatched in different cellular compartments or environments by these two viruses and this should be considerated at early steps of drug design for large spectrum inhibitors.",

The structural homology between the three available crystal structures indicates that a common pharmacophore including Mn2+ chelating functional groups might be active against all three viral families. Based on these crystal structures, several compound families have been described and their antiviral activities characterized using enzyme-based assays, viral growth assays and protein structure data. The first compounds benefiting from structure-based activity analysis are catechins isolated from green tea. Although they seem to target both neuraminidase (Song et al., 2005) and endonuclease, one active pharmacophore was identified as 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl. The same group extended the family of interesting compounds with thalidomide derivatives, active through their 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl moieties, and later with marchantin-like phytochemicals produced in very high yield in liverworts (Iwai et al., 2011). Together with enzyme and virus-infected cell assays, docking the latter compounds into the PA endonuclease active site gave very interesting perspectives for effective drugs targeting influenza RNA capping.",

All RNA viruses capping their own viral RNAs have evolved enzymes profoundly different from those of their host cell. As the power of antiviral compound screening and design increases, there are no doubts that viral RNA capping enzymes will be the target of novel highly efficient and selective drugs. Despite few exceptions, the identification and atomic resolution structure of target enzymes from major families has made significant progress in the last ten years. The recent connection of viral RNA capping to the host cell innate immunity mechanisms is more than ever a promising antiviral research field.",

            "text": "Fig. 2: Canonical RNA capping mechanisms. The cap-0 structure is formed on nascent RNA chains by the sequential action of three enzymes. (1) The RNA triphosphatase (RTPase, pink) hydrolyses the \u03b3 phosphate of the nascent RNA (pppN-RNA, where N denotes the first transcribed nucleotide) to yield a diphosphate RNA (ppN-RNA) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). (2) RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase, light blue) reacts with the \u03b1 phosphate of GTP releasing pyrophosphate (PPi) and forms a covalent enzyme\u2013guanylate intermediate (Gp-GTase). The GTase then transfers the GMP molecule (Gp) to the 5\u2032 diphosphate RNA to create GpppN-RNA. (3) RNA (guanine-N-7)-methyltransferase (N-7 MTase, green), recruited by the GTase, transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the cap guanine to form the cap-0 structure (m7GpppN) and releases S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) as a by-product. The capping reaction is then completed by the methylation of the ribose-2\u2032-O position of the first nucleotide by the AdoMet-dependant (nucleoside-2\u2032-O)-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O MTase, orange), generating cap-1 structure (m7GpppNm2\u2032O). Below the schematic are listed examples of viruses that acquire their cap structures using the cellular capping machinery (first four examples) or encode their own viral capping machinery that adopt the canonic pathway. Question marks indicate viruses likely to follow this conventional pathway.",
