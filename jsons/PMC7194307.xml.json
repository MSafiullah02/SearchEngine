            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease characterized by extensive inflammation and gliosis in the central nervous system [1]. The main pathological feature of MS is widespread demyelination and oligodendrocyte degeneration [2]. MS has therefore been interpreted as an oligodendrocyte disease. More recently, the possibility of neural damage has been raised. In particular, it is accepted that axonal loss occurs in different areas of the central nervous system [3, 4] including the spinal cord [5] and corpus callosum [6]; this lesion is involved in permanent disability characterizing the later chronic progressive stage of MS [7, 8, 9]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and MRS imaging studies have provided evidence that axonal loss and neural damage in MS can be both substantial and early [10, 13] and these noninvasive measures have demonstrated the existence of direct links between these axonal changes and disability [14, 15, 16].",

Evidence from work on animals has also demonstrated that damage to axons can occur with central nervous system inflammation, as indicated in mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus [19], in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) [18, 20, 21] and in nonhuman primate models of MS [22].",

However, development of neuroprotective strategies is dependent on defining the precise mechanism whereby effector cells and molecules damage axons, and on whether neural damage is limited to the axon or also involves the soma. On the basis of behavioural data indicating severe neurological disabilities, including force deficit and diffuse tissue inflammation and gliosis in the spinal cord of rats affected by EAE, we investigated the relation between clinical profile, gliosis and motoneurone neurochemical phenotype in the spinal cord of EAE\u2010affected rats. We focused on the acetylcholine synthesis enzyme [choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)], calcitonin gene\u2010related peptide (CGRP), which is considered a trophic peptide for motoneurones, and nerve growth factor (NGF) low\u2010affinity receptor p75LNGFR, which normally is not expressed by motoneurones in adult animals. Alterations of all these markers have been described in different experimental conditions associated with axonal damage [24].",

The brain and spinal cord were then removed and immersed for 2 h in ice\u2010cold fixative, before rinsing for 48 h in ice\u2010cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer. For immunocytochemistry, the following antisera were used: mouse antiglial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) (Chemicon Temecula, CA, USA), mouse anti\u2010nestin (BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA, USA), mouse anti\u2010rat CD11b (OX42, Sera\u2010Laboratory, Crawley Down, UK), mouse anti\u2010oligodendrocytes (Chemicon Temecula; immunogen: oligodendrocytes cultured by the rat olfactory bulb), goat antip75LNGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Oligonucleotide probes complementary to mRNAs encoding ChAT (nucleotides 1818\u20131860) and \u03b1CGRP 664\u2013698, respectively, were synthesized in a Beckmann OLIGO 1000 DNA synthesizer (Fullerton, CA, USA).

Afterwards, the labelled probes were purified through Nensorb\u201020 columns (New England Nuclear), and DTT was added to obtain a final concentration of 10 mm. The resulting specific activity ranged from 1 to 4 \u00d7 106 dpm/ng oligonucleotide. The sections were brought to room temperature, air dried, covered with a hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 4\u00d7 SSC (1\u00d7 SSC: 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 1 \u00d7 Denhardt's solution (0.02% polyvinyl\u2010pyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% Ficoll), 1% sarcosyl, 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10% dextran sulphate, 500 mg/ml heat\u2010denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 200 mm DTT and 40 ng/ml of the labelled probes [29].

Finally, the slides were rinsed in distilled water followed by 60% and 95% ethanol (2 min each), air dried and then dipped in NTB2 nuclear track emulsion (Kodak) for 3 weeks before being developed with Kodak D19 for 3 min and fixed with G333 (Agfa Gevaert, Leverkusen, Germany) for 10 min. Quantitative analysis was performed on emulsion\u2010dipped sections, slightly counterstained with toluidine blue using AIS (Imaging Research Inc.) grain counting software. ChAT and CGRP mRNAs expression was measured in the motoneurones on both sides in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, in an area corresponding to the lateral motor nucleus, by choosing five matching sections in each animal. Eight to 10 cells on each side were then measured. Cells were considered labelled if the silver grains were more than five times the background silver level, as determined by averaging grain counts over defined areas of the spinal cord devoid of positively labelled cell bodies. The average values from each animal were used for statistical analysis.",

We also confirmed that a severe gliosis results from astrocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasy in EAE [1]. GFAP\u2010IR cells surrounds the cell body and dendrites of spinal motoneurones during acute EAE, and we found that GFAP\u2010immunostaining further increases after resolution of the acute phase.",

            "text": "While axonal damage has been indicated as one of the typical features of MS and EAE histopathology [3, 15] ever since it was first described, the possibility of whole neurone damage being a possible substrate for both permanent motor disabilities and cognitive problems and degeneration has only emerged in recent years. Gene expression switching has been described in spinal motoneurones in response to axotomy and during regeneration [31, 32]. Sciatic nerve axotomy produces a transient loss of ChAT mRNA, re\u2010expression of p75LNGFR[24] and increase in cellular content of CGRP and mRNA [33]. Demyelinating lesions located where motor roots emerge from the spinal cord cause axonal lesions in motor neurones [18]. We describe how a decrease in ChAT mRNA expression is linked to increased CGRP mRNA levels and the re\u2010appearance of p75LNGFR\u2010IR in the acute stage of EAE. ChAT mRNA levels decrease concomitantly with dramatic microglial (OX42\u2010IR) and astroglial activation, as described by nestin\u2010IR. Nestin is recognized as an earlier marker for astrocytic activation than GFAP [34]. CGRP in motoneurone acts as cotransmitter for acetylcholine, enhancing its spontaneous release in skeletal muscle, but also has a perhaps prevalent trophic action [35]. The rise of CGRP\u2010IR in deafferentiated motoneurones is generally attributed to increased synthesis, although accumulation because of the blocking of peripheral transport cannot be excluded [36, 37]. The neurotrophin receptor p75LNGFR, which binds NGF, brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3\u20134 (NT3\u20134) and tumour necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) [38], is expressed by developing motoneurones in the spinal cord, whereas in adult motoneurones it re\u2010appears after lesions, including sciatic nerve axotomy [39, 40]. p75LNGFR has also been associated with cell death [41]. However, it is accepted that p75LNGFR upregulation possibly increases resistance to pathological motor neurone degeneration [42] and is present only in adult motor neurones that are allowed to regenerate [43].",

            "text": "Acute axonal damage is associated with an axonal conduction block, ion channel redistribution [20] and interruption of axoplasmic flow [44], including also trophic factors. We have already reported a dramatic drop in NGF content in the spinal cord during the acute phase of EAE and this defect could be involved in the clinical symptoms [30]. Indeed NGF administration attenuates neurological deficits in EAE marmosets [45, 46], and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which has been indicated as a major trophic factor for adult motoneurones, is a protective factor for severe neurological deficits in EAE [47]. Finally, a proper axonal function is required for successful remyelination in experimental pathologies [48]. Electrical activity in the axon is actually involved in regulating differentiation and the survival of oligodendrocyte precursors during development [49] and plays a key role in the induction of myelination [50].",

We found that immunostaining of an astrocyte marker protein such as GFAP clearly highlights the cell body and dendrites of motoneurones in layers 8 and 9 of the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Astrocytes in EAE animals actually have a decreased capacity to metabolize glutamate, as indicated by the severe decrease in the activity of specific enzymes [51]. Damage to dendrites and synapses occurs in motoneurones in inflamed spinal cord during EAE, as indicated by quantitative analysis of protein associated with these cell components [32]. Dendrite damage recovers significantly, although incompletely, during EAE remission [52], such as molecular indices of synaptic structures [53]. The temporal profile of alterations in dendrite and synapse damage in spinal cord correlates with the neurochemical changes we describe in the present study. In spite of the recovery, we cannot exclude that repeated inflammatory attacks or permanent gliosis may lead to permanent phenotype changes and even to motoneurone degeneration.",

Our study was not designed to evaluate motoneurone cell number, so we cannot speculate as to whether recovery of normal neurochemical phenotype in single neurones means recovery in all neurones or only in surviving neurones. Recently, Smith et al. [54] described how motoneurones are subject to lymphocyte attack leading to a 30% reduction in neurone density in the ventral spinal cord in acute EAE. Neural cell loss has been indicated as one of the possible causes of brain and spinal cord atrophy in MS and EAE [55]. Apoptosis actually causes severe cell loss secondary to axonal damage in retinal ganglion cells during EAE [56] and it has been shown that cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients induces neuronal apoptosis in vitro[57]. Imaging studies have indicated that while normal brain atrophy is estimated at around 0.1\u20130.2% per year in normal subjects, it increases to approximately 1% in patients with progressive MS [58, 59]. Brain and spinal cord atrophy is also a common feature in remittance\u2010relapsing MS including also the spinal cord [60].",
