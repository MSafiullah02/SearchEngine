The endemic localities are found along valleys of the Danube, Sava rivers and their tributaries. The patients are mainly rural people aged 40 and over. The main symptoms of the disease are progressive loss of kidney function without raised blood pressure leading to end-stage kidney failure. In up to 50% of EBN patients, tumors of the urinary tract appear. There are no reliable specific tests and the diagnosis of EBN is based on clinical and epidemiological grounds. It has been variously estimated that there have been more then 15,000 cases of EBN in the three countries, with most of the cases coming from former Yugoslavia [1]. At present there are over 700 EBN patients on dialysis in Serbia alone. In the endemic area of Doboj in Bosnia, the origin of the 5 patients from which the kidney biopsies were taken, there have been more than 500 EBN cases. In the period since 1989 there are about 100 recorded cases from the same locality.",

Various toxins from the environment have been proposed as the cause, including heavy metals and mycotoxins [2, 3, 4], but none of these have been shown to be exclusive for the endemic areas. There appears to be some evidence that genetic factors may contribute to susceptibility to EBN [5]. Evidence for the involvement of viruses based on histological, ultrastructural and epidemiological data has been published [6, 7, 8]. It was suggested that EBN is a slow virus disease caused by a coronavirus [6]. Efforts to isolate viruses from urine of patients have failed.",

However, there was no cross-reactivity with IBV, a kidney pathogen for chicken. In the specific neutralization tests with reference sera and prototype viruses of the three antigenic groups of coronaviruses, there was no cross-reactivity. These findings indicate that the virus surface projections, which carry the receptors of the new virus, are antigenically distinct and specific for EBNV (table 1). The virus is similar to the human coronavirus OC43 and 229E because it failed to grow in embryonated eggs and failed to agglutinate the red cells of several species. Further work is needed to confirm the identity of this isolate as a new virus infecting humans.",

Only 13% of the control group have the specific neutralizing antibodies in low titers compared to 60% with immunofluorescent cross-reacting antibodies. The people positive for specific neutralizing antibodies to EBNV could possibly be accounted for by migration. These are preliminary results.

In support of this thesis is the interesting finding that in one endemic locality of five villages with a mixed half Christian and half Moslem population, only 2 out of 53 documented cases of EBN were Moslems [20]. As the Moslems in this region do not keep pigs, this finding may focus further investigations on pigs or boars as the possible animal host. Another epidemiological study also indicated that a particular breed of pigs could be the host [21].",
