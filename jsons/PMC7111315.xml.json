There is a belief that donkeys are highly tolerant to pain and are stubborn/stupid, which is a misconception. This is based on a noticeable donkey resistance to painful and frightening situations, being their reaction commonly subtler than horses [1], [2].",

This efficiency has also made them prone to pathological conditions associated with negative energy balance, in particular those related to excessive lipolysis, excessive hepatic triglyceride synthesis, and release into systemic circulation (dyslipidemia), with serious systemic consequences. Dyslipidemias in donkeys occur secondary to physiological (pregnancy, lactation, and food deprivation) and pathological (stress, gastrointestinal disease, endotoxemia, respiratory problems, liver diseases, parasitism, laminitis, and so forth) processes linked to a negative energy balance. No primary causes of dyslipidemia (as seen e.g., in cats) have been reported in donkeys. Liver disease (19.4%) followed by colic (13.8%) were the most common primary conditions in a study of 449 dyslipemic donkeys [9].",

Unlike ruminants and cats, the liver of equids does not produce ketone bodies. If lipolysis persists, plasma triglycerides levels increase (hyperlipemia), resulting in macroscopic lipemia (from turbid to creamy plasma) and ultimately fatty infiltration of multiple organs (most commonly the liver, but also kidneys, intestine, pancreas, heart, and skeletal muscle). Severe liver infiltration, in addition to causing dysfunction may lead to hepatic rupture. Cortisol, which increases in stressed animals, may contribute to the development of hyperlipemia by activating hormone-sensitive lipase, fat mobilization [18], [19], impairing triglyceride clearance by lipoprotein lipase [10], and reducing insulin sensitivity, emphasizing the relevance of stress as a risk factor for this condition in donkeys [20]. Transport can be stressful for donkeys, and some animals may develop hyperlipemia after transportation [21]. Hormone-sensitive lipase can also be activated by catecholamines, some interleukins, glucocorticoids, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and glucagon and is inhibited by insulin [22].",

Enteral feeding via a small-bore nasogastric tube could be considered if the primary condition allows it. If there is intolerance to enteral feeding and hyperlipemia persists, partial parenteral nutrition is indicated [23]. Considering that basal energy requirements are lower in donkeys than horses and even lower in sick donkeys, it is advised to start parenteral nutrition with a low percentage of the estimated needs. There are several reports on the use and efficacy of parenteral nutrition in hyperlipemic donkeys [22], [24]. If hypertriglyceridemia persists after 24 hours of treatment or hyperglycemia develops, 0.1 IU/Kg/hr insulin should be administered, joined by a close glycemic control to avoid hypoglycemia and/or regulate insulin dosage. High levels of insulin could have deleterious effects, such as laminitis secondary to hyperinsulinism [25]. Animals with insulin dysregulation (ID) are prone to hyperlipemia, and there is a correlation between triglycerides and insulin levels [26]. Insulin could be administered to inhibit the hormone-sensitive lipase activity. Protamine zinc insulin (40\u201360 IU IM) administration has been described in a hyperlipemic jenny [22]. Human recombinant insulin can also be administered intravenously to regulate the glycemia when parenteral nutrition is started.",

Insulin dysregulation has not been thoughtfully studied in donkeys, although previous reports in donkeys [33] and horses [37] have correlated insulin levels over 20 \u03bcIU/mL with the presence of laminitis. However, the new guidelines for horses indicate a cutoff value of 50 \u03bcIU/mL for ID [38]. In view of this recent change, it is important to emphasize that donkeys with ID frequently show higher insulin plasma concentrations than horses with ID (personal communication). While lacking more deliberate and species-specific studies, this cutoff insulin level could also be used for the diagnosis of ID in donkeys, taking into consideration both interassay and interlaboratory variability.",

Commercially available diets to promote weight loss in horses with metabolic disorders and laminitis may not be appropriate for donkeys because they provide an excess of calories and protein to donkeys. Whenever possible, and in the absence of laminitis, donkeys should be kept in a paddock, allowing them to do some exercise. Nonetheless, when these animals pass a long time in the paddock, they tend to focus on grazing and, due to their ability to ingest high quantities of dry matter in short times, the final objective could not be reached. Due to the intrinsic gregarious behavior of donkeys, the presence of other animals (either donkeys or horses) in the paddock is recommended. Moreover, the presence of other equids could avoid stress and even favor exercise. Grazing should be avoided during the morning (even more in spring) or after rainfall. A muzzle could also be useful in certain conditions. A weight-loss program in donkeys is a slow and patience-demanding process, where losing a 2% bodyweight per month (similar to horses) could be a reasonable goal, although a specific weight-loss program has not been developed for this species.",

Intense training, riding, and competition are not common practices in this species, therefore performance loss is not a typical clinical sign of gastric ulcers in this species. Similarly, donkeys are usually fed a forage-based diet and only rarely high quantities of grain or mixed feeding. The aforementioned factors could make us think that gastric ulcers are an uncommon finding in donkeys [73]. Nothing is further from reality. Donkeys are animals that are highly prone to stress although the triggering situation is commonly different to the typical examples in horses (competition and training). For a donkey, as a markedly gregarious animal, transport, estrangement from their paddock-mates, allocation in an isolated paddock, mixing with unknown individuals, or separation of the jenny from her foal could be the most illustrative examples of stressful events compared with training or competition in horses. In modern countries, overfeeding and grain overloading are also predisposing factors for the development of gastric ulcers both in donkeys and horses. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration and other comorbidities such as hyperlipemia and renal disease have also been described as predisposing factors. Recurrent colics (that are even unnoticed for the owner due to donkeys' stoicism), weight loss, or general poor condition are the most common clinical sings observed in donkeys suffering of gastric ulcers. However, no evident clinical signs are also frequent in affected donkeys.",

Lesions, as stated for other authors [74], [75], [76], are commonly located on the squamous area along the margo plicatus. Al-Mokaddem et al., (2015) also studied the effect of several parasites on gastric ulcers [76]. They found that Habronema spp., Draschia megastoma, Gasterophilus spp., and Trichostrongylus axei have only a residual role in the appearance of gastric ulcers in donkeys (Supplementary Material 1). Anecdotally, we have observed in dapple-gray donkeys an intense black mucosal pigmentation during gastroscopies (Supplementary Material 2). This finding was commonly located in the proximal part of the esophagus (near the proximal sphincter) and can be likely a melanin-pigmented area. Motility was normal in every animal with this lesion. Donkey-specific information on drugs that influence gastrointestinal function, gastric acid secretion, or gastric mucous healing is scarce. Omeprazole (4 mg/Kg/PO q 24 hours for a month), the most common gastric ulcers treatment, is often used following dosing protocols for horses, but this drug has not been studied in donkeys at this time.",

Causes are similar to those described in horses: bacteria (mainly Salmonella and Clostridium spp.), virus (coronavirus), parasites (small and large strongyles), sand (Fig. 5\nA and Supplementary Material 3) and drug-induced (antibiotics and NSAIDs). Therapeutic management of colitis relies on the same principles applied to horses [87] because species-specific studies are not available for donkeys at this time. Treatment is focused on restoring adequate hydroelectrolytic and acid\u2013base status, recovering oncotic pressure with colloids and/or plasma administration, dispensing toxin-neutralizing drugs (smectite, mineral oil, activate charcoal, or psyllium), removing antibiotics or NSAIDs if they are a suspected cause, promoting mucosal healing (misoprostol and omeprazole), and using antiendotoxic-acting drug (polymyxin B), NSAIDs such as pentoxifylline, and suitable antibiotic and local anti-inflammatory agents such as metronidazole. Acute laminitis secondary to colitis-induced endotoxemia should be also prevented with cryotherapy and LMWH, which also would help precluding disseminated intravascular coagulation. A positive energy balance is essential to prevent dyslipidemias.",

A pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been reported in a 15-year donkey via laparoscopy [88]. Contrary to other equids with this kind of tumor [89], neither hepatic failure nor metastases were seen in that donkey. An adrenal cortical carcinoma has also been reported in a donkey with anorexia and depression, which died 24 hours after admission. Local invasion of the left kidney as well as metastases in liver, lungs, and heart were found at necropsy [90]. Lymphomas, metastatic gastric squamous cell carcinomas, and mesotheliomas have also been observed. Other neoplasia types have also been vaguely and sporadically described in this species [91].",
