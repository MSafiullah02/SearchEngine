In the USA and other higher-income countries, many surveillance activities will be mandated by local or federal authorities and other licensing and regulatory bodies. Other surveillance activities will vary, based on an understanding of the epidemiology and risk at a particular institution. For instance, surveillance for invasive aspergillosis in an institution undergoing new construction and with a large compromised host population might be rated a higher priority than the long-term monitoring of Legionella in an institution where Legionella has not been identified for years. Each hospital must tailor its surveillance activities based on risk assessment of the population as well as the available resources within the infection control team and healthcare entity.

In the USA, standardized definitions and method\u00adologies developed by Centers for Disease Control (CDC)/National Health and Safety Network (NHSN) have been widely adopted so that comparisons can be made both within the health system and across institutions.10, 11\n2.Surveillance should be an active process that includes review of microbiologic data, clinical and nursing records, pharmacologic and pathologic data, readmission and reoperation data following surgery for selected procedures, etc. Automated surveillance systems utilizing computer-based patient records or other electronic data may provide a sensitive, specific, time-efficient and cost-effective mechanism in many institutions.12, 13 The surveillance methodology should rely on metrics that are objective, standardized and incorporate meaningful risk adjustment.3.Case adjudication by the practitioners of the procedural area under evaluation should be avoided; in this setting the process may be prone to bias and lose objectivity, especially if financial incentives are involved. On the other hand, periodic review of the case definitions and feedback on the surveillance by members of the practice team may provide insights that can result in corrective quality improvement actions adapted to that specific practice.4.Whatever the system of surveillance is, both numerator and denominator data must be available for review. For instance, central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) are expressed as number of CLABSI/number of central line days \u00d7 1000. Thus, trends can be tracked and compared within and between institutions.5.Appropriate benchmarking should be sought. Increasingly, healthcare systems are being compared and inferences on quality of care are being made, sometimes with suboptimal risk adjustment.6.Appropriate risk stratification is essential to identify and prioritize which areas should be targeted for performance improvement within a given institution. However, differences in hospital size, patient mix and risk adjustment introduce complexity when comparing rates between smaller community hospitals and tertiary care/specialty hospitals. In 2009, NHSN transitioned from reporting rates of HAIs to the standardized infection ratio (SIR).14 The SIR is the ratio of expected over observed events for a particular HAI. Expected events are based on NHSN national data collected in the previous years and risk adjusted using multivariate regression analysis. Both SIR and rates are currently being used to compare similar healthcare facilities at the state and national level.15\n7.Reports describing the surveillance activities and findings should be prepared (using appropriate statistical analysis) and distributed to the appropriate groups.8.After feedback to the particular service is provided, that service (generally in conjunction with the IPCP) should develop an action plan for process improvement with measurable outcome metrics.\n",

Hospital X's surveillance for hip prosthesis involves review of all microbiology data for all hip replacements done at the institution plus readmission data after hip replacement, as well as antibiotic utilization data for patients with hip replacement. Charts are then reviewed to evaluate if a hip infection occurred and at what level (superficial, deep or organ/space, by NHSN criteria).It is noted that in the third quarter, compared with the previous quarter, there was an increase in the number of hip infections with a standardized infection ratio (SIR) of 4.0. Charts are reviewed to confirm, and an epidemic curve is generated, suggesting that the increase in infection started in mid July. This information is reported back to Orthopedics as well as the Administrative hospital leadership. Patient data review indicates that the infections are with multiple different organisms, with procedures performed with multiple different surgeries in different operating rooms (ORs).It is noted by one of the healthcare workers interviewed that a new surgical scrub was put into place in late June in the orthopedic ORs, and the concern is raised that this may be associated with the increase in infections. A review reveals that the new scrub is not being used per recommendations. A plan to develop and implement an educational module regarding surgical scrub is enacted, and by September the SIR for hip infections has decreased to 1.8.\n",

The former requires the hospital to establish a list of restricted antimicrobials and a method by which authorization for use is obtained from an infectious disease physician or clinical pharmacists. The latter requires the ASP team to review antimicrobial utilization and provide appropriate feedback to prescribing physicians. Other methods that may be utilized include antimicrobial order forms, guidelines or order sets for the treatment of specific infections, computer-based alerts, and educational programs for hospital staff.
