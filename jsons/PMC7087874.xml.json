Microorganisms such as Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, airborne viruses exemplified with SARS and influenza are of concern for the public health and associated with an airborne route of exposure (Stetzenbach et al. 2004). Disease causing bacteria or viruses can also be deliberately dispersed as bioaerosols (Atlas 2002; Levin and de Amorim 2003), and in the absence of reliable biological detector and surveillance systems, exposed individuals will not be aware of a biological incident until clinical symptoms appear and when they seek medical care. Knowledge about the microbial diversity in air is important for detector performance and for development of specific, selective and sensitive methods for detection and identification of specific airborne pathogenic bacteria.",

Bacteria belonging to different genera were identified, and the dominant cultivable bacteria collected on agar in slit array was gram-positive Actinobacteria and Bacillus, whereas the dominating sequences identified in DNA samples extracted directly from collected aerosol samples was gram-negative Proteobacteria. Characterization of viable airborne bacteria at an underground subway in Oslo (Norway) showed that the major bacteria identified belonged to the genera Bacillus, Micrococcus and Staphylococcus (Dybwad et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has successfully been used for microbial identification. Comparatively, the gold standard method 16S rDNA sequencing for identification of bacterial isolates is more time-consuming and less cost effective (Woo et al. 2003; Cherkaoui et al. 2010). For bacteria, the mass spectrum of unknown isolates is compared to a spectral library of reference strains and the species or genus is assigned based on the highest percent similarity to the reference spectral profiles (Sauer et al. 2008). Several publications have described the use of MALDI-TOF MS in routine clinical analysis (Eigner et al. 2009; Patel 2013). The MIDI MIS technique is based on fatty acid methyl ester analysis by gas chromatography (GC-FAME) and has been used to identify microbes in environmental and clinical samples (Slabbinck et al. 2009). The fatty acid profile (dependending on the growth medium used for culture) of a microbe is complex and unique to each bacterial strain, and hence, it can be used for identification purposes. In addition to identification, FAME analysis has been used for strain or subspecies level comparisons (Van den Velde et al. 2006). Previously, the MIDI MIS system has been successfully utilized for the differentiation of various strains of Bacillus thuringiensis (Adams et al. 2005). The cellular fatty acid profiles of 67 strains belonging to three different species of the genus Mycobacterium have been determined from clinical samples (Ozbek and Aktas 2003). However, to our knowledge, there are few articles describing the use of the MIDI MIS system and MALDI-TOF MS for identification of airborne bacteria (Chan et al. 2009; Dybwad et al. 2012, 2014).",

The number on each agar plate differed between no colonies and several hundred. A representative selection of morphologically distinct bacterial colonies were isolated and re-streaked two times on TSA agar to produce individual colonies and incubated as described before identification. A total of 140 colonies were isolated. The origin of the 140 isolates was the following: 71 isolates from Norway, 43 from Sweden and 26 from Finland. Of these isolates, 122 (87 %) were identified and confirmed by similar results for two of the three methods and 103 (74 %) were analyzed using all three methods for comparison of the three identification methods. When colonies were shipped to Finland and Norway for analysis, a single colony was transferred from the TSA agar onto an agar slant of TSA (1 mL) in cryo tubes (2 mL) and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 24 h before transportation by mail. Upon arrival, the colonies were streaked out on TSA agar and incubated as described. However, some colonies were not able to grow after shipping or storage and therefore unable to be identified. Therefore, the number of analyzed isolates varies from the total number (140 as stated above) of colonies picked. The number of isolates analyzed by the three different methods is stated below. Isolates were kept for long-time storage at \u221280 \u00b0C in brain heart infusion broth (Oxoid) supplemented with 18 % glycerol (Merck). The number of colonies, CFU/m3 of air, reflects the ratio of airborne particles carrying viable organisms.",

The spectra are compared to a reference database (Bruker Taxonomy) by the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 system, and putative genera or species is identified from the fingerprint of the bacteria. From sampling campaign I, II and III, a total of 127 (91 %) of the 140 isolates were analyzed. Some isolates failed to grow after storage and shipping and was therefore not identified. The analysis was performed as described (Dybwad et al. 2012). Briefly, a single colony from a TSA agar plate (kept at room temperature) was deposited on the 96 ground steel target plate as triplicate and air-dried. In the direct method, the target plate with the colonies was overlain with 1 \u00b5L matrix solution [4-hydroxy-a-cyanocinnamic acid (HCCA)]. The sample was air-dried and loaded into the MicroFlex instrument for data acquisition. The Biotyper 2.0 system was run in automatic classification mode, and the reference database used was the Bruker Taxonomy database (v3.1.1.0, containing the 3,740 library entries). Analysis of each sample takes 5\u201315 s. Some difficult-to-process isolates were extracted with ethanol/formic acid (Drevinek et al. 2012) to obtain better quality mass spectra. Score values proposed by the manufacturer were used to classify the isolates: >2.3 high probable species identification; > 2.0 < 2.3 probable species identification; > 1.7 < 2.0 probable genus identification; <1.7, not reliable identification.",

            "text": "In Norway and Finland, the gram-positive Firmicutes represented by Bacillus and Staphylococcus were dominating. However, in Sweden, the gram-negative Gammaproteobacteria Acinetobacter was dominating. Cultivation-dependent techniques typically display a high proportion of gram-positive bacterial phyla (Atlas and Bartha 1997), and genera such as Micrococcus, Bacillus and Staphylococcus are commonly found in air samples from different sources (Mancinelli and Shulls 1978; Fang et al. 2007; Dybwad et al. 2012, 2014; Fykse et al. 2008). The results obtained in this work emphasize and supports these findings. However, it is challenging to predict how representative the microbial population identified in the present study are based on cultivation, when compared to the real airborne microbial community. It is difficult to find an optimal growth medium for a wide set of viable bacteria in air samples. In this study, TSA agar was chosen based on the requirements for the MIDI MIS analysis. Using different growth media, other bacterial species might have been recovered; however, gram-positive bacteria mainly identified in Norway and Finland are commonly identified in air samples. The results described in this study only represent a set of bacteria found during the three sampling periods in the three countries and are not representing the total bacterial diversity per se at the different sampling sites. Culture methods may also suffer from methodological constrains since bacterial groups can be overestimated, exemplified by Aeromonas and Acinetobacter showing high plating efficiency on nutrient-rich agar (Amann et al. 1995). Culture-independent methods have become important for analysis of bacterial diversity in the environment since <1 % of the bacteria in such communities is cultivable by standard laboratory methods (Amann et al. 1995). Since the year 2000, several culture-independent studies have been published and these studies show that the dominant-bacterial phyla differ in different locations and bacterial sequences affiliated to the gram-negative Proteobacteria are commonly found (Radosevich et al. 2002; Maron et al. 2005; Despres et al. 2007; Fierer et al. 2008), which support the findings of Acinetobacter in Sweden during the first sampling period. A recent study where culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were compared showed that the majority of the cloned sequences (60 %) from an aerosol sample were closely related to the cultured bacteria identified and sequences related to the Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, and Firmicutes frequently appeared (Fahlgren et al. 2010). The Acinetobacter bacteria are widely found in nature, mostly in water and soil. However, they have also been isolated from the skin, throat, and various other sites in healthy people. Acinetobacter baumanni is often associated with hospital-acquired infections but does not typically colonize healthy people outside hospital settings (Peleg et al. 2008). It is difficult to explain the high level of Acinetobacter isolated in Sweden compared to Norway and Finland. However, during the first experiment in Sweden, the temporal increase in the level of total bacteria showed correlation with sudden wind direction changes (results not shown). This implies that materials may have been stirred up from the ground, e.g., soil or dust particles and that the origin possibly is from a rather localized source. The area around the sampling site in Sweden can be described as a suburban area close to coniferous forest. In general, the weather conditions during the sampling periods were also similar and can hardly explain the observed differences. However, it may also be due to cultivation biases that Acinetobacter would have been overestimated (Amann et al. 1995).",

In general, all three technologies turned out to be useful methods for identification of bacterial isolates collected from air. The 16S rDNA sequencing method is time-consuming and more laborious compared to MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI analyses. MALDI-TOF MS and MIDI MIS reduce the time required for identification of bacterial isolates since sample preparation and analysis time are shorter (minutes\u2013hours) compared to 16S rDNA sequencing, which includes PCR, sequencing of the PCR amplicons, sequence evaluation and trimming and taxonomic analysis (days). When comparing the ability of the 16S rDNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS to identify and assign the bacterial isolates to a taxonomic level, no significant difference between the two technologies appeared, and 87 % of the isolates were assigned to similar genus. This result is in agreement with the conclusion in the study of Dybwad et al. 2012. A significant difference between the 16S rDNA sequencing and MIDI analysis was identified, and a higher percentage of the isolates were not assigned to a taxonomic level (compared to 16S rDNA sequencing and MALDI-TOF) when using the MIDI identification system. One explanation for this difference might be differences in the databases used in the various identification methods. In general, the Biotyper 2.0 used for MALDI-TOF MS have been used extensively for analysis of clinical isolates (Eigner et al. 2009; Patel 2013), and MALDI-TOF MS is well established in clinical laboratories and is used as a high throughput rapid identification method of clinical isolates (Benagli et al. 2011). The database used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis needs to be expanded by several environmental bacteria, which will greatly benefit the use of this method for identification of environmental isolates (Dybwad et al. 2014). The database used for MIDI MIS analysis is for environmental aerobic bacteria. However, an advantage of MALDI-TOF MS compared to MIDI analysis is that the culture media have no effect on the identification. The MIDI analyzes is based on fatty acid methyl ester analysis by gas chromatography, and the database used is based on the use of TSA agar (Slabbinck et al. 2009). The present results are in agreement with other studies showing that the MALDI-TOF MS method is comparable to the 16S rDNA sequencing method for identification of bacterial isolates (Seng et al. 2013). In the case of identification and classification of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in sea food, the MALDI-TOF MS analysis demonstrated to be a competent bacterial typing tool, and in some cases, MALDI-TOF MS had more discriminating potential than 16S rDNA sequencing (B\u00f6hme et al. 2013).",

These results highlight the use of MALDI-TOF as an alternative to the more costly and time-consuming gold standard method 16S rDNA sequencing for identification of cultural environmental bacteria. The MIDI method was also useful; however, the percentages of the isolates identified and classified to genus level were lower, and this method is dependent on the growth media used. In conclusion, this study, where bacterial isolates collected from air was identified, showed that the 16S rDNA sequencing and the MALDI-TOF MS analysis had similar discriminating power, whereas the MIDI method turned out to have less discriminating power in this comparison using the databases specified under the present conditions. The present studies are also important for developing realistic testing and evaluation schemes for biological detection systems by providing microbial background information that can be used to mimic operational environment in aerosol test chambers (Berchebru et al. 2014).",
