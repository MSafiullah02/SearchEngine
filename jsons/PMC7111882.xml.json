At present, TGE continues to be considered internationally as a highly contagious disease in swine, which results in a mortality rate close to 100% in newborn piglets (Cavanagh, 1996, Sola et al., 1998). A common vaccine likely cannot induce a local immune response in the small intestine and provide solid protection to piglets (Tuboly et al., 2000). Therefore, the development of effective anti-TGEV agents for controlling TGEV infection remains an important goal.",

            "text": "Green tea is derived from the dried leaves of Camellia sinensis and is one of the most commonly consumed beverages around the world (Ning et al., 2011, Pengbo et al., 2010). Approximately 70% of green tea extracts is catechins (monomeric flavonoids) (Sang et al., 2011). (+)-Catechin is one of the catechins in green tea. Many studies have shown that the catechins of green tea possess multiple pharmacological activities (Chang et al., 2003, Friedman, 2007, Song et al., 2005). Previous antiviral studies have indicated that catechins exert inhibitory effects on different types of viruses in different ways (Friedman, 2007). Typically, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a subclass of catechins, can efficiently inhibit the entry of hepatitis B virus (HBV) into immortalized human primary hepatocytes by inducing clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Huang et al., 2014). The antiviral effect of EGCG on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been shown for several steps in the HIV-1 life cycle, including a destructive effect on viral particles, post-adsorption entry and reverse transcription in acutely infected monocytoid cells (Yamaguchi et al., 2002). The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of (+)-catechin have been previously observed in several studies (Bragan\u00e7a de Moraes et al., 2014). However, the impact of (+)-catechin on viral infections has not been previously investigated in detail.",

TGEV induces a CPE in ST cells, and this effect is associated with TGEV-induced apoptosis (Eleouet et al., 1998). Furthermore, the ROS response is up regulated in TGEV-infected cells, and ROS accumulation causes oxidative stress, which plays an important role in the TGEV-induced apoptosis pathway (Ding et al., 2013). Antiviral studies have shown that EGCG decreases the ROS levels in MDCK cells infected by influenza A virus and inhibits influenza A replication (Ling et al., 2012). In addition, the replication of enterovirus 71 is inhibited by EGCG, which is consistent with the down regulation of ROS generation in infected Vero cells (Ho et al., 2009). As a natural antioxidant, (+)-catechin can protect human hepatoma cells (HepG2) from oxidative DNA damage induced by heterocyclic amines (Haza and Morales, 2011). Additionally, the apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in dermal fibroblasts can be protected by (+)-catechin (Tanigawa et al., 2014). As shown by our results, (+)-catechin can protect ST cells from TGEV-induced CPE and greatly alleviated the ROS induced by TGEV. In conjunction with the improved intracellular ROS conditions, TGEV RNA replication and the viral titre in the supernatant were clearly down regulated. Hence, the antioxidative activity of (+)-catechin is a key factor in cytoprotection and antiviral activity.",
