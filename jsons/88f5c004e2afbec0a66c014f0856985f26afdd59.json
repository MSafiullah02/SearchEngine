We need less contact with each other to decrease the chance of infection, but this means loss of economic activity, as well. This tradeoff is inevitable in our society, because we still need direct communication and commuting, so far. The focus of our paper is the structure of society, on which we have direct contacts. We study on spreading process with artificial sosiety model, where each agent has daily cycle and go office and back home, every day. At the same time, infection spreads along SIR model. We show both slow infection and short commuting can be realized with some structures and vice versa. The most effective factor for such features is modularity of society. In highly modular society, agents live around the destined office, but agents commute long way to their office and can be infected fast, in not modular society. The first infection point is one more factor for the features. If the first infection takes place around the office, infection spreads slower. On the contrary, if the first one takes place far away from the office, infection can be fast. We show a design principle, high modularity and sparsely distributed offices, for good society and discuss on possible solutions in real society, where we live in. arXiv:2005.06658v1 [physics.soc-ph] 13 May 2020",

In our human society, infectious diseases are conveyed through human body, since many of them can not survive for long time out of human bodies. When humans are neighboring, they can easily infect from each host into others, through the air, droplet or direct contacts. This means the spreading process of the infectious diseases can heavily depend not only on our immune system, but also on human social activity and structure. Actually, many governments recommend less human migration or social gathering to decrease the potential chances of infection. On the other hand, the risk of massive infection is emphasized in the modern human society, because of change in our lifestyle, e.g. much higher mobility and wider radius of action. As a result of such wider range of our activity, we have more chances to hit unknown infectious pathogens or other hosts.",

We should work and iterate daily life cycles for our survival in economical meanings, while we want to decrease the chances to hit some other hosts and meetings, as a potential risk for infection, therefore. To solve this seemingly incompatible desires at once, we study on the possibile structures of human society using an artificial society model here. In the artificial society, we should commute to the office everyday. Here, as the commuting, we assume railways and its network. In overpopulated cities, we mainly rely on railways and such an overpopulation itself can be a major risk for infection.",

If the spreading proceeds at once, hospitals can not afford satisfactory medical treatment and this can result in more victims. In this meaning, we call a city with slow spreading as safe one and fast spreading as dangerous. In daily lives of agents in our artificial society, they can meet other host agents in commutation, office and their home. Since the many chances of meeting hosts means fast spreading, intuitively, agents will iterate daily life cycles without unnecessary hittings to other hosts, in safer cities. Here we show results of variety of configurations and some design principles for safe or dangerous cities. How can we model spreading dynamics itself? The spreading process of infectious diseases have been studied intensely in the field of complex networks [2, 3, 6, 10, 13, 15] . Many of them adopt a kind of SIR model, which have sucseptible, infected and recovered state of agents, because of its easiness for understanding and implementation. Along this line, we adopt SIR model as spreading dynamics in our artificial society, as well.",

Then what types of societies have such favorable and unfavorable features? Here we show some of the top favorable and the worst favorable ones, in FIG.2. We selected them from 1000 tests with the same parameter settings, along the infection time. We colored nodes along the ratio of destinations of agents living there. Office nodes have outer blue disk as well and the first infected node, the source of infection, is colored with outer red disk. If many of agents of a node go to the office with red color, the node have similar color. If agents, living in a same node, go variety of office nodes, the node have mixed color. At a first glance, we can notice higher contrast in top societies and lower contrast in worst ones. Once a node is infected, infection ratio can grow within the same colored cluster, because many agents living there share long time at the office node. Then infection spreads into the other cluster through some agents with other offices. Since mixing of infected and susceptible agents can easily occur in the nodes with variety of destination offices, mixed colored nodes can have shorter infected time.

However, we can confirm strong deviations in the trend. In the spreading process, infection can proceed within the same node easily, but not between different nodes. We can evaluate the chance of infection between different nodes with overlapping of schedules. Here we compare all combinations of scheduled paths and count such overlappings between different nodes, i and j. We show one more result on the count of overlappings, C ij . In FIG.5 , mean of the count, ij C ij /N 2 , is plotted along the rank of infection time. We can confirm weak declining tendency along the rank. This means degree of overlappings in schedules can be a weak sign for fast infection. However, we have strong deviation again. In reality, further infection requires not only chances to infect nearest neighbors in the count matrix, C ij , but also second or higher order neighbors in the matrix. In such a later stage in spreading process, more detailed structure should be considered into estimation of infection time. 6 Here we used the same parameters in the previous test. As we can see, we can easily confirm the same tendency in the previous test, except for the vertical scale. In this result, deviation of infection time is smaller than the previous one. Since we show the mean infection time averaged over all possible start infection nodes for every configurations, deviation can be decreased in the result. How the place of first infection can bring about such difference in mean infection time? We can guess the distance, between office and the first infection, may be the main factor of that. We show the result of correlation between them in the FIG.8. In the cases of shorter distance between office and the first infection, we can large deviation of infection time. On the contrary, we can not see such large deviation in the cases of longer distance. This result may be conter-intuitive, but we can consider the destination entropy to understand this. Slow infection can be observed in low destination entropy cases. In such a low destination entropy case, we can easily confirm clusters defined with the destinations. If the first infection takes place near an office, spreading would consist of multi steps with some clusters and take long time. On the contrary, it would not take so long time to spread, ",

One more different feature is shown in FIG.11 . A society with only one office node and some shortcuts has many configurations for safety rather than others.

In the case of only one office node, almost all agents share similar working time at the same office. In this case, small commuting loss means slow infection in straightforward. design principles for good/bad societies Let's go back to the original interest of us. Here we investigate on design principles for good/bad societies. In our definition, good society means slow infection and short commuting. Bad society means fast infection and long commuting. We studied on some factors, which can result in good or bad societies in the previous sections. One is the destination entropy. We confirmed the destination entropy may be one of the main factors, in  FIG.5, FIG.9 and FIG.3 . At the same time, we notice one more feature in FIG.5 and FIG.9 . In those societies, we see densely placed office nodes in bad ones and sparsely placed ones in good ones. To confirm this tendency, we show mean distance between office nodes along the infection time ranking. In FIG.14, we can confirm short distance means fast infection and long distance means slow infection. This result leads us the possibility of one more main factor for good/bad societies.",

However, the pathogen is conveyed mainly by human and we can manage the FIG. 14. Office sparsity. As an index for office sparsity, the distance between offices in each society is plotted along the rank of infection time. As the distance, we calculated weighted average over all possible simple paths between offices in each society. The weight is determined in the same way as selection of paths in scheduling. Here we used results of all possible first infection nodes test. spreading process in some ways, therefore. Ideally we should prevent contact with other persons to decrease the chance of infection in principle. However we should keep our daily cycles to maintain our economic condition, at the same time, and can not escape from contacts with other persons. In this meaning, we have tradeoff between economic and survival activity. That is why we focus on the social structure, where humans iterate own daily economic activity and contact with each other.

In ideal societies, agents show clear segragation in the meaning of destined offices in their daily cicles, FIG.3 One more stliking feature of such a society is sparsely distributed offices, FIG.14. Since agents share long time mainly within the same destined ones, such clear segragation means fast infection in the same group. However, if we see the other groups, with other destined offices, they have only limited chances for infection from the first infected group. At the same time, this type of social structure means short commuting time because of the modular structure [7, 8] . Actually, we can say both of features are satisfied with in many cases, FIG.15 .",

If we can assume the setting, without the effect of population density, we can depict the spreading process as the iterative mixing of sucseptible and infected ones at the office and home, in short. In this situation, the solution for ideal society is modular separated structure in the meaning of destined offices. However, if we can assume overpopulation at railways, like Tokyo, we can not ignore the significance of infection on the railways. If agents with variety of destined offices share the same railways, the mixing, at the railways, will have more significant impact on spreading process.

Since we are living in the era with enhanced infrastructure for remote communication, it is not hard task, we believe. In addition, we have one more possibility with internet of things, which will decrease the necessity of physical operations on site. With the aid of connected world, we can decrease the necessity of daily commuting itself. On the other hand, even if we have enhanced infrastructure for remote communication, we still do not have enough technologies for natural communication, e.g. virtual reality for non-verval information facilitating [12] .
