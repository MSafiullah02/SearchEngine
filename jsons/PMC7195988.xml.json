In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The clinical presentation of 2019-nCoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to very severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure, which may result in death [1]. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and, in March 2020, began to characterize it as a pandemic in order to emphasize the gravity of the situation and urge all countries to take action in detecting infection and preventing spread.",

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Other routes have also been implicated in the transmission of coronaviruses, such as contact with contaminated fomites and inhalation of aerosols, produced during aerosol generating procedures. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic individuals (or individuals within the incubation period) has also been described. However, the extent to which this occurs remains unknown [2].",

The interim guidance published by the WHO on 7 March 2020, \u201cResponding to community spread of COVID-19,\u201d states that preventing COVID-19 from spreading is through the development of coordination mechanisms not just in health but in areas such as transportation, travel, commerce, finance, security and other sectors which encompasses the entirety of society [3].

To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, individuals should be advised to wash hands diligently, practice respiratory hygiene (i.e., cover their cough), and avoid crowds and close contact with ill individuals, if possible. There are posters and brochures prepared by many organizations on all issues related to protection from COVID-19 and are widely used all over the world (Figure 1).The WHO and other similar health organizations have published visual tools such as videos and posters to demonstrate the correct application of hand hygiene throughout the entire society (Figure 2).These posters, distributed throughout different parts of society in order to draw maximum attention to the importance of hand hygiene, created awareness among all of them. With the increase in the number of people carrying hand sanitizer with them for the application of instant hand hygiene and the spread of mask usage among people in countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, the pandemic was brought under control much more quickly. In those countries where such measures were not made mandatory, the exponential rise in the number of cases continues. ",

Examples for social distancing include closure of schools or office buildings and suspension of public markets, and cancellation of gatherings.

The quarantine of persons is the restriction of activities of or the separation of persons who are not ill but who may been exposed to an infectious agent or disease, with the objective of monitoring their symptoms and ensuring the early detection of cases.
