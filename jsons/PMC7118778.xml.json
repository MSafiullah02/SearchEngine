            "text": "The field of virology was barely half a century old in 1948 when Dr Thomas Francis wrote 2 articles, \u201cViruses as Agents of Disease\u201d and \u201cThe Prevention of Virus Disease,\u201d that were published in this journal. Early leadership by Mayer, Ivanovsky, Loeffler, Frosch, Walter Reed and others, allowed progress from \u201ccontagium vivum fluidum\u201d1 and a simple understanding of the existence and predatory nature of viruses to the characterization of viruses with regard to size, resistance to chemical and physical agents, host and tissue selectivity, and pathogenic and immunologic effects. These investigations made it clear that viruses were a very diverse group of pathogens. However, our knowledge of viral-cell interactions and the effect of viruses on the immune system was rudimentary. We held the understanding that a recovered individual is not susceptible to reinfection with the same virus, and that serum contained components that when mixed with virus and injected into a susceptible animal that animal was protected. These basic concepts served as the basis for classic studies of active and passive immunization. But several important advances that occurred between 1948 and 1957 jump-started the field of modern virology. These included the development of cultures of single animal cells,2, 3 Watson and Crick's identification of DNA and the genetic code,4 the development of optimal medium for growing cells, and the development of the viral plaque assay.5 By the early 1950s, Max Theiler and Jonas Salk (killed virus) had developed vaccines for yellow fever and polio, respectively, and through the benefits of growing the viruses in cell culture, shortly thereafter Sabin developed the oral (live attenuated virus) vaccine. Introduction of these vaccines into the human masses remains to this day one of the greatest accomplishments of preventive medicine.",

Viruses and components of viral infections were analyzed using gel electrophoresis, protein-antibody interactions, and biochemical assays to answer basic biologic questions. As a result, greater knowledge of virus replication, viral and cellular receptors, and immunologic interactions was achieved. Specifically, research during this time led to an understanding of the regulation of gene expression including transcription factors, enhancer elements, promoters, aspects of RNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase, as well as the discovery of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins. Scientists tagged viruses to identify intracellular locations of viral proteins, understand nuclear and cytoplasmic shuttling, and map neural circuitry. Complete genomic sequences of viruses have been recorded and entered into public databases. The benefits of databases such as FASTA and BLAST have led to searches in homology between motifs characteristic for specific gene products and the identification of novel viral genes and their functions.",

Positive selection being the method whereby genomic fragments or single candidate genes are expressed in a suitable cell system and tested for functionality (ie, infection phenotype). In contrast, negative selection is based on the construction of viral mutants that lack specific genes and the implementation of studies that identify a change in phenotype when the viral mutant infects a particular cell or animal. Use of these techniques has led to the identification of virulence factors, novel mechanisms of regulation of cell surface receptors, and signal transduction pathways. Within the last decade, the emerging fields of genomics and proteomics have allowed for the functional analysis of a large number of transcripts and protein sequences that are expressed during viral infection that provide new clues as to the regulation of acute, chronic, and persistent viral infections, as well as reactivation and malignant transformation. Excitingly, the last decade has demonstrated that scientists have the knowledge and skill to harness unique features of viruses (eg, adenoviruses, retroviruses, herpesviruses) in implementing gene therapy and targeting processes important in chronic disease and cancer. However, mastery of this field remains to be seen.",

Moreover, the outcomes are often severe when humans serve as novel hosts to emerging virus infection (eg, avian flu virus, Ebola virus, equine hemorrhagic fever viruses, Hanta virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hendra virus, Nipah virus, sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and West Nile virus).6 Of great importance is the fact that the oral cavity continues to be the source of transmission of many viruses, the site of replication and asymptomatic shedding of viruses, and a site where persistent viral infections exist, the latter being a prerequisite for virally induced malignant transformation. Clearly, the field of virology has grown to the extent that a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d paper would be exhaustive in length. Accordingly, this review focuses on specific viral cell interactions that allow the virus to survive the cellular attack and evade the immune system, establish persistent infections, and cause chronic disease.

The first innate defense encountered is cellular selectivity during the entry process. Viral attachment proteins bind to specific cell receptors (proteins, carbohydrates, or glycolipids) and coreceptors. The absence of a specific receptor shields the cell from attack. If this level of defense is foiled, upon binding receptors can sense microbial infection and trigger a multitude of antimicrobial and inflammatory responses. The toll-like receptor (TLR) family which consists of 10 to 15 members are well characterized in their ability to detect bacterial components (ie, lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acids, flagellin) as well as unmethylated CpG motif DNA of bacteria and viruses (detected by TLR9), double-stranded RNA (detected by TLR3) and single-stranded viral RNA (detected by TLR7).7 In particular, TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 specialize in viral detection and recognition of nucleic acids within the intracellular compartments which results in defensive signaling.",

In contrast, a nonpermissive cell downregulates virus replication and lytic gene expression resulting in little to no viral progeny.

The process is regulated (\nFig 1) by a family of aspartate-specific cysteinyl proteases, or caspases, that converge at a number of downstream points resulting in proteolytic cleavage and enzyme activation.9 Caspases are segregated into 2 distinct subfamilies. The \u201capoptotic\u201d caspases (2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) are involved in the cascade that results in protease production, chromatin condensation, and cellular degradation. The \u201cinflammatory\u201d caspases (1, 4, and 5) provide a second round of defense against viral infection.10 The inflammatory caspases are involved in the proteolytic maturation of key cytokines (ie, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18). Cytokine IL-18, also known as interferon (IFN)-inducing factor, directs the production of IFN-\u03b3.11 In turn, IFN-\u03b3 induces expression of proteolytic active subunits that lead to proteolysis and antigenic processing by TAP proteins. TAP proteins are critical for displaying viral antigens on the cell surface (see Cellular Immunity, below).12\n",

IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 are produced rapidly when viral factors interact with cellular pattern-recognition receptors such as TLRs and cytosolic receptors. Historically, synthesis of IFN-\u03b1 has been attributed to macrophages and B cells, and IFN-\u03b2 has been considered to be produced by fibroblasts. More recently, plasmacytoid dendritic cells have been shown to produce IFN-\u03b1 preferentially to IFN-\u03b2. Both IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 prevent the replication of viruses by inducing formation of secondary messengers which include IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, IRF-5, IRF-7, c-Jun/ATF-2, and NF-\u03baB.37 IFN-\u03b3 is synthesized by activated T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells following receptor-mediated stimulation or in response to cytokines produced by macrophages or antigen-presenting cells (ie, primarily IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) or by stimulation through T cell receptors (TCRs) or NK cell receptors. It is a powerful activator of mononuclear phagocytes, thus enhancing their ability to destroy intracellular microorganisms and tumor cells. IFNs mediate their antiviral action through IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which number in hundreds. IFNs also regulate the cell cycle and have antiproliferative effects.",

HSV-1 and HSV-2 encode infected cell polypeptide (ICP)-47, an immediate early gene product, that interacts with the TAP protein in the cytosol to prevent peptide binding to TAP.54 Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes US6, a 183\u2013amino acid glycoprotein, that blocks peptide transport by binding to TAP in the endoplasmic reticulum.55 Although efficient at both retaining MHC-I molecules and preventing CTL recognition, HCMV also uses additional viral proteins (US2, US3, US6, and US11) to evade the immune system.56 A different approach is taken by EBV. This human \u03b3-herpesvirus encodes a glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) domain on EBV-encoded nuclear antigen (EBNA) 1 that inhibits ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis of EBV antigens.57 Thus, processing (ie, degradation) of viral proteins into antigenic peptides is restricted.58 KSHV, a lymphotropic \u03b3-herpesvirus, interferes with MHC-I antigen presentation by ubiquitinating the cytosolic domain of the MHC-I.59 Herpesviruses also produce proteins that target MHC class I molecules for degradation in lysosomal compartments60 and downregulate expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules by shutting off host cell protein synthesis by the gene known as virion host shutoff (VHS, UL41).61\n",

Even when antiviral therapy achieves a sustained virologic response (ie, absence of viremia 6 months after the end of treatment), highly sensitive assays (ie, polymerase chain reaction) detect residual viral genomes in most patients, indicating the ability of viruses to persist and autoregulate based on their environment.70, 71\n",

These proteins afford protection by limiting changes in conformation of, or enzymatic action on, the restricted gene. Histones are the most notable guardians of the effectors. Histones permit access of DNA to specific activators or repressors, general transcription factors, and RNA polymerase by posttranslational modification (acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) of their amino terminal tails.83, 84 For example, hyperacetylation of histones is associated with an \u201copen chromatin\u201d conformation and transcriptional activation, whereas hypoacetylation of the histone complex is associated with condensed (hetero-) chromatin and gene silencing.

Emphasis was placed on mechanisms that permit survival of host defenses, evasion of the immune system, and establishment of chronic infections. Detailed knowledge of these processes has led to many therapeutic successes. However, additional knowledge is required for us to make strides in eliminating human suffering caused by these intracellular pathogens. It is hoped that 50 years from now when another review may appear in this journal on this topic, we will have a better understanding of how to eliminate persistent viral infections and identify patients at risk for virally induced complications of acute and chronic infections and will have harnessed the power of viruses to undergo selective lytic replication in tumor cells and modulate chronic disease.",
