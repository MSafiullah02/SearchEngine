            "text": "Antibiotics deserve much of the credit for the dramatic increase in life expectancy around the world in the 20th century. A famous physician expert once noted that the discovery of penicillin in the early 1940s showed more curative power to a lone provider than the collective talent of all the physicians in New York at that time [1]. Unfortunately, it is inevitable that, after sometime, bacteria develop resistance to existing antibiotics, making infectious disease more difficult to treat [2]. The resistance profile has probably been smouldering issue for years, but nowadays it\u2019s almost like a switch got triggered. Infectious disease experts are alarmed by the prospect that effective antibiotics may not be available to control the re-emergence of previously deadly infections and the emergence of new infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria in near future. Recent outbreaks of pneumonia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), for example, both of which have re-emerged within the region itself, have also focused regional, national and international attention on the threat developed by re-emerging infectious diseases and in particular on southeast Asia as the epicentre of these types of diseases. Indeed, tuberculosis and pneumonia are re-emerging in a drug-resistant form [3,4].",

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus and the most recent pandemic influenza A H1N1 are only a few of many examples of emerging infectious diseases in the southeast Asia; each of these diseases has caused global societal impact related to unexpected illnesses [5]. Other emerging infectious diseases caused by bacteria are less terrible than these examples; however, they nonetheless may take a significant increase in morbidity as well as cost related to prolong treatments. In recent years, the infection caused by bacteria in man to have probably emerged in china was brain abscess during infection with Bacillus megaterium [6]. To the best of our knowledge, infections caused by these bacteria are rare and have not been reported as the cause of any important clinical diseases [7,8]. While it is not known which new infectious diseases will emerge tomorrow, populations have to be protected by staying one step ahead of the microbes by searching a new antimicrobial drugs. Moreover, researchers also discovered some bacterial species that are resistant to different classes of antibiotics, including new synthetic drugs, even though these bacteria have never exposed to antibiotics [9,10]. These studies support a hypothesis that antibiotic resistance is genetically rich natural phenomenon, deeply embedded in the bacterial pan-genome in which bacteria evolve; it can be slowed but not stopped. If these types of non-pathogenic bacteria create any health problems, then it\u2019s very difficult to control them by conventional antibiotics. Hence, we need new antibiotics to control resistant bacteria, which must act at several cellular and molecular levels. The mode of action of nano-silver is not known for specific at single sight but to influence bacterial membrane permeability and many metabolic pathways at same time.",

Additions of plant extract into the silver nitrate solution resulted in the gradual change of the colour of silver nitrate solution from light yellow to dark brown, indicating the formation of nano-silver (Fig. 1\na). Similar colour changes were reported in previous studies and hence confirmed the completion of reaction between silver nitrate and stem extract [20]. The synthesis of nano-silver was further confirmed by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer. A strong specific peak for the synthesized nano-silver was obtained at 420 nm (Fig. 1a). Dynamic light scattering data showed that the synthesized nano-silver were in the range of 82.60 nm + 0.8 (Fig. 1b), which is well in agreement with SEM result (Fig. 1c). The surface zeta potential value of nano-silver was measured to be slightly positive and was found to be 16.2 mV (data not shown in Fig. 1). The positive charge of nano-silver prevents them from aggregation and increases their stability, as well as help to enhance their antibacterial activity by interacting with negatively charged biomolecules of bacterial membrane [21]. The SEM image of the sample showed the formation of spherical nano-silver in aggregated form with average 84.84 nm size, which was confirmed to be silver by EDX analysis (Fig. 1 c and 1d). The EDX analysis showed a strong peak at 3 keV, which is typical for the absorption of metallic nano-crystallites silver due to unique surface plasmon resonance (SPR), thereby confirming the formation of nano-silver [22]. The presence of additional peak for oxygen indicates that some nano-silver got oxidized by forming silver oxide [23].",

            "text": "Our findings showed that B. megaterium MTCC 7192 developed resistance to all tested antibiotics, except linezolid (Fig. 2a and 2b). Linezolid is a new class of antibiotics called the oxazolidinones that are useful to control the emergence of drug resistance Gram-positive organisms [25]. Unfortunately, B. megaterium MTCC 7192 developed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol, which has been valuable combinatorial therapy for treating a variety of infections. This emerging resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol is disturbing because it is a combination of two broad spectrum antibiotics that act synergistically against a wide variety of urinary and respiratory tract infections [26]. There are limited data available to the infections caused by B. megaterium, there have been no previous data on resistant to antibiotics, except cloxacillin and streptomycin and thus, careful investigation is required [27,28]. The increasing bacterial resistance among Gram-positive species is concerning because they are responsible for 1/3 of nosocomial infectious diseases [29]. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa MTCC 741 developed resistance to all tested broad spectrum antibiotics (Fig. 2c and 2d). Our findings of bactericidal activity of nano-silver against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa are exactly in accordance with findings shown by Lara et al. [30]. In recent years, P. aeruginosa bacteria that are resistant to different classes of antibacterial agents is one of the most feared bacteria that causes pneumonia [31,32]. The high antibiotic prescribing rate is one of the leading causes for the development of antibiotic resistant microbes in case of re-emergence of infectious diseases. However, the speed of the resistance development varies depending on the antibiotics and microbes. Overall, our findings suggests that there was significant difference between the bactericidal efficacy of nano-silver and antibiotics on emerging B. megaterium MTCC 7192 and re-emerging P. aeruginosa MTCC 741, demonstrating that the bactericidal mechanism of nano-silver was not affected by those known resistance mechanisms that differentiate these strains from susceptible strains. The data presented in the study are novel as nano-silver exhibit excellent bactericidal effect towards emerging and re-emerging bacterial infections regardless of their drug resistant mechanisms.",
