They then sequenced a 384-well plate of clones using a universal primer. This yielded multiple reads, 6 of which were of sequences of a single virus. Further evaluation of these sequences demonstrated homology (albeit limited) to known polyomaviruses, with the closest relationship being to KI, a polyomavirus that had recently been recovered from respiratory tract samples from individuals with respiratory symptoms [1]. The newly discovered virus was designated WU, in keeping with the practice of naming polyomaviruses with 2-letter designations (e.g., KI, JC, and BK). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that WU and KI are divergent from other known polyomaviruses and define a novel branch within this family.",

The very high frequency of detection of additional viruses, which were detected in almost three-fourths of the patients, complicates the analysis. Nonetheless, the frequency of its detection in individuals (especially young children with respiratory symptoms) in 2 geographically distinct areas highly suggests that it is a cause of human disease. In the meantime, we can expect the continued identification of additional novel viruses as candidate human respiratory pathogens and can add WU, along with the recently identified rhinovirus HRV-QPM [2], to the list of viruses identified in respiratory tract specimens since 2001: human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, human bocavirus, KI polyomavirus, and now HRV-QPM (rhinovirus) and WU polyomavirus.",

In a small, prospective, open-label trial, outpatients with SSTI were randomized to receive treatment with either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) or doxycycline (100 mg), each given twice daily for 7 days [2]. Although there was not a statistically significant difference in outcome, all 3 treatment failures occurred among the 14 patients who received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, for a treatment failure rate of 21%. The optimal antibiotic choice thus awaits results of future clinical trials with sample sizes sufficient to allow for definitive answers. One problem, however, is that community-acquired MRSA is a moving target, and that, in some geographical areas, it has acquired additional antibiotic-resistance determinants. An additional factor that must be considered in future trials is the potential benefit of effective antibiotic therapy on the prevention or delay of recurrences of infection.",
