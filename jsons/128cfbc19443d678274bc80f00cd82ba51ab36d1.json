For example where personal ART pick-up is not possible it could be organized by home delivery or distributed through existing peer to peer contacts. For that reason NGOs' funders need to show flexibility in re-writing already sponsored programs. The shortage of resources is evident and the impact on HIV care inevitable.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic hit disproportionately European region, with over half of a million people being infected with the virus within four weeks, of whom more than 40 000 died [1] . So far this represents half of all confirmed cases worldwide and two thirds of deaths. There is increasing worry that low and middle income countries are not testing for SARS-CoV-2, therefore the number remains strongly underreported for some Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. This is the middle ground where uncontrolled coronavirus pandemic meets fragile or basic healthcare systems.",

On 19 th March we decided to review the status of HIV care sustainability in the face of emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. For this purpose, we constructed an on-line survey consisting of 23 questions, Most were open-ended with a predefined multiple choice answers plus an 'other' option providing space for the respondent's free-text reply (Appendix). Respondents were recruited from the ECEE members in 22 countries (one per country), based on their involvement in HIV care, and contacted through e-mails. No country reported HIV clinic closure. HIV clinics were operating normally in six countries (31.6%). In three countries there were either shorter hours or reduced staff and in ten (52.6%) normal activity (regular visits and blood tests) was suspended and only ART distribution was continued. In 11 (57.9%) countries physicians were sharing HIV care and COVID-19 care duties (Figure) .",
