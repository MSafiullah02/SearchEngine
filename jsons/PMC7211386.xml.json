            "text": "Today, the occurrence of unexpected incidents around the globe affects governments and nations causing a great number of fatalities and significant economic losses. Despite many recent advances, incidents and disasters remain one of the most important concerns of a man's life [1]. Therefore, it is important to pay more attention to the development of plans, principles on natural disaster reduction and their effects, as well as the proper management of disaster risk reduction [2]. Among the many components involved in crisis management, relief and rescue in emergencies, healthcare centers, especially hospitals, play a major role [3]. Due to the lack of predetermined structures for proper management and focus on activities and training programs, these healthcare centers may expose to multiple risks and performance dysfunction [4]. Therefore, hospital preparedness is the main element of disaster management programs, which should be based on a standard protocol [5]. One of the invaluable management instruments which has an effective role in empowering services of healthcare centers according to global experiences is the Hospital Incident Command system (HICS) [6]. Hospital Incident Command system is a management system used to help manage incidents in unexpected situations and makes an attempt to build a coordination between hospitals and other institutions involved through using a rational and integrated management structure, responsibilities and duty description, creation of transparent reporting channels, and building a simplified and commonplace terminology system [4,7]. Regardless of their size or ability to provide care for the patient, health centers, especially hospitals, can use the system for planning and responding at all-hazard emergency situations [8]. According to the reports published by the organizations in the United States, the system has been able to improve the quality of delivered hospital services in crisis situations very effectively and offered many effective crisis management plan and strategies for the hospital [4]. HICS was designed in 1991 as one of the strategies of hospitals for contrast with disasters with the mission of prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery in hazards [6]. The Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) is widely used by hospitals, yet there is a paucity of research and a lack of developed models to examine HICS implementation [6 ,9]. In addition, our review shows that there has been no comprehensive study analyzing the positive or negative aspects of the system [9]. Perhaps the importance to develop HICS for emergencies has led scholars to ignore its qualitative aspects [6]. Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of Hospital Incident Command System, the current study aimed to assess the effectiveness of system with a focus on its features, strengths, weaknesses, factors contributing to the increasing and decreasing of system effectiveness, as well as important factors involved in system assessment. The aim of the current study was investigating and categorize factors affecting HICS effectiveness with a focus on its features, strengths, weaknesses, factors contributing to the increasing and decreasing of system effectiveness, as well as important factors involved in system assessment to improve the effectiveness of HICS. Therefore, the findings of this study can increase the knowledge of decision makers about the HICS in order to improve hospital readiness and respond appropriately during accidents and disasters.",

This system is designed to achieve the common goal of incident prevention, reduction of mortality, financial losses and severe damage. The system has several features that contribute to achieving these goals and affect its success. The present study indicated that there are several significant features affecting the effectiveness of hospital incident command system including the organized command structure [10] based on the same principles and compliance with the key structure of the incident command [9,11,12] use of a bureaucratic framework based on military principles [13]. This system is characterized by an organizational form of the structure [6], hierarchical structure [13-15], and a specific command chain [16]. In addition, this system provides an appropriate and reliable structure for leadership regardless of the incident type [17]. A clear spoken language \u2014based on the common [4,6,9-12, 16, 18], simple and commonplace [4,18] terminology is another feature of the system.the hospital incident command system can define specific  organizational functions and roles through job descriptions [11, 19,20], rational tenets for the allocation and organization of occupational activities [14] clarify the precise managerial tasks and responsibilities [21], access to a list of personal job descriptions [22], positions [4, 18], responsibilities [4, 18, 20, 23, 24], individuals duties [4, 7, 16, 18, 23, 25- 28], external organizations [28], responsibilities of hospital incident command system team [29],Specifying specific roles in an organizational table [22,23], and consequently prioritize tasks based on the job description worksheets [6] and recruit the personnel when it becomes necessary [30]. Additionally, numerous studies have focused on other structural features of Hospital Incident Command System including modularity [12], flexibility [13-16, 19, 23,31], both flexibility and modularity [4, 6-8, 11, 14, 18, 32], analogy and comparison [9], compatibility [17], adaptability in crisis situations at a variety of scales [17,18, 23], and category [26,31] and concordance with planned and unplanned events [33] and effective for management in potentially changing environments [10]. The hospital incident command system is based on the principles and characteristics mentioned.

The hospital incidnet command system brings significant benefits to hospitals and plays an important role in improving the quality and delivery of services during emergencies and disasters in hospitals. Hospital incident command system provides a powerful framework [10] standard template [8], structured and organized incident response [16] and facilitates emergency incident response [19]. various advantages for hospital incident command system including provision of the most reliable management protocols [18], and comprehensive crisis management strategy [8] can apply to improve the management capabilities of the emergency [31]. HICS develops strategies for effective and efficient dealing with crisis situations [4], accelerates effective and quick response [8,11], increases effectiveness [18, 23], enhances efficiency and effectiveness of the response plan [31, 34], facilitates communication between different units of the system in emergency incidents [35], fosters problem solving process among the organizations involved [22,25] and ultimately, reduces the chance of errors and parallel work [25].",

Hospital incident command system with some its features can lead to the cost minimization [4, 18, 22, 23]: provision of accurate and timely documentation on spending and resource utilization, [11] reduced financial losses and severe injuries, [6] effective use of resources, [22] provision of adequate and efficient medical facilities and personnel [39], effective use of all resources for problem solving [17], provision of resources and equipment [30,44], provision of health care facilities for emergency management [33], use of manpower on a regular basis [45], providing health facilities needed for emergency management [33], regular staffing [45] and sharing resources in organizations and health care centers [6, 11]. So considering the strengths of this system, HICS has been identified as one of the factors necessary to boost resilience [42], hospital empowerment [6], incident management and reduced fatalities [6], response to daily operations and emergency and non-emergency situations [22].",

Buck DA and colleagues also stated in their study that although the system was successful in firefighting organizations, it has not been successful in some organizations, such as public health [45]. Similarly, SA Andrew et al. questioned the usefulness capabilities of system in reducing organizational disputes, especially at large-scale incidents and events [46] and FM Burkle et al. found that the system is unable to manage the complexities of a large-scale health-related disaster, especially epidemic situations [47]. the main disadvantage is that the structure cannot be changed or be reliable in terms of training, coordination and administrative capability [48].Furthermore, Timm NL et al. reported that hospital staff were completely unfamiliar with the language system and were unable to use terms such as logistics, operations, financial to explain leadership roles [48].The vastness of the range of job descriptions in the system is another weakness of the system [48] Likewise, NL Timm et al. noted the inefficiency of the system in real time response and exposure to stress [48]. Some studies have also referred to high cost as one of the other problems in the system [23].

YarMohammadinia et al. found that the lack of legal requirements with continuous regulatory change, and the absence of unity of command [23], can weaken and decrease the system's efficiency and effectiveness [23]. Furthermore, the lack of a general method for assessing HICS and hospital-based exercise programs [25], lack of cultural management for crisis command, lack of the need to create this system by managers, lack of support and commitment from authorities and managers, shortage of qualified managers at all levels, paying attention to daily activities by managers, lack of a common management language [23] and lack of senior management commitment to system implementation of the [9] can attenuate system performance.",
