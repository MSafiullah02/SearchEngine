Moreover, a debate has arisen regarding the ethical basis of the clinical and public health research being conducted during these emergencies. Research opportunities in bioemergencies are ample, and a number of considerations must be taken into account to ensure patient, public, and care worker safety.

Reciprocity refers to the obligations of healthcare workers during a pandemic and the obligations of society to them in return; that is, the acceptance of a healthcare provider\u2019s risk taking care of a patient with a highly communicable disease engenders reciprocal duties on the part of the community to them. Social usefulness refers to the idea that healthcare workers preferential access to prophylaxis and treatment would be directly associated with the continued ability of the healthcare system to provide interventions to everybody else [4].",

Typically, the IRB receives a written application describing the research, as well as the investigators description of how the investigator will assure that risks are minimized, the risk benefit relationship is acceptable, subject selection is equitable, and so on. The IRB reviews this information (along with the full sponsor protocol, the informed consent documents, the investigator\u2019s brochure, and any additional materials) at a full convened meeting. After due deliberation, the board may approve the research conditional upon minor modifications or return the application to the investigator for clarification or modifications needed to satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
