It is well established that health and environment are closely and intimately interlinked (Haque and Singh 2017). Environment as an input for good health and wellbeing should be protected and preserved. Reflecting on the growing urban spaces associated with increasing number of city inhabitants, it becomes imperative to plan for particularly urban health. Keeping in mind the future needs and demands, the government plans to build 100 new smart cities in India. This is in cognizance with the Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements goal to build planned resilient sustainable cities that are prepared for disasters and promote health and wellbeing. It is essential to focus on low carbon-emitting energy resources for transportation, industry and agriculture for the development of sustainable cities. The present chapter encapsulates landmark policies, acts and programmes undertaken by the government of India to promote good health and wellbeing and pave way for bringing sustainable urban development.",

This is approximately combined population of the six countries, namely the USA, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Japan (Patel 2015). However, with large human resource base comes many inherent challenges. India is bearing the dual burden of diseases where on the lower end, malnutrition, hygiene, immunization, sanitation and infectious diseases are major concerns; and on the higher end, environmental health and lifestyle diseases and other non-communicable diseases have raised alarm. Cardiovascular diseases, tuberculosis, cancer, diabetics, malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya, respiratory infections, vector and water-borne diseases continue to be major challenges among the latter group (Central Bureau of Health Intelligence 2016). Added to this is the threat of emerging infectious disease like Ebola, SARS and H1N1 influenza virus-related diseases. As per the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (2016), India is facing the \u2018Triple burden of diseases\u2019, i.e., unfinished agenda of communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and emerging infectious diseases. Among the communicable diseases, in 2015, morbidity reported from acute respiratory infections was the highest (67%) followed by acute diarrhoeal diseases (23%), whereas mortality reported was highest from influenza A H1N1 (23%), acute respiratory infections (20%) and pneumonia (18%) (Central Bureau of Health Intelligence 2016). Hence, the concern of the future decade is not only population increase and composition but also quality of human resource.\n",

Break-up of public and private spending reveals that 26.20% and 73.80%, respectively, were the contribution. This is highly skewed and the public sector spending is lowest in comparison with USA (45.5%), UK (81.70%), Brazil (41.60) and China (44.70%). On the other hand, the private sector contribution is highest in India while the global average is 40.40% (2010). The per capita spending on health care is also among lowest in India (40 USD). However, it is notable to see that the healthcare industry is growing in India owing to population increase, expected increase in geriatric population, lifestyle-related diseases, rising literacy and disposable income that makes health care more affordable.",

Herein, detailed plan for National Health Service with universal coverage was envisaged. The Bhore Committee presented a detailed analysis of the present situation with suggestions. Further, the Sokhey Committee (established in 1938) report was released in 1948. This was a sketchy report as compared the Bhore Committee report. Nevertheless, the recommendations of both concurred. Unfortunately, the health disparity and coverage of health services still remain grave. In post-independence, it was not until 1983 when the first health policy was formulated and adopted. But before 1983, schemes made under the Five Year Plans were fulfilled. These had specific targets like, in the 1950s and the 1960s, the focus was on managing the epidemics. Widespread national-level campaigns were started to overcome the loss by malaria, smallpox, tuberculosis, leprosy, filaria, cholera and others. The approach was techno-centric wherein the health workers were trained to prevent and control disease spread. International experts and ideologies influenced the mission. The necessary chemicals, medicines and vaccines were dependent on international agencies. The role of social and economic conditions, environment, diet, nutrition, housing and clothing was ignored. Moreover, the structure of public healthcare delivery system remained unchanged in first two Five Year Plans and urban areas continued to receive major share of resources. By the end of second plan, there was one Primary Health Unit per 140,000 rural populations (14 times less as per Bhore Committee recommendation) and one hospital for 320,000 rural populations. On the contrary, in urban areas, the ratio for hospital and dwellers was 1:36,000 and 1:440 for hospital bed per population. Clearly, the health disparities were quite high and needed urgent attention. Murlidhar Committee was set up in 1959 to evaluate the progress made in the first two plans and provide recommendations. Though there were success stories with regard to the control of disease-specific deaths, improvements in life expectancy and reduction in death rate; the committee bought forward the issues of availability and accessibility to healthcare services. The primary health centres (PHC) were understaffed and ill-equipped, the health practitioners were less in number and urgent need to improve healthcare facilities was asserted (Sharma 2017).\n",

Later, when the holistic definition of health was released by WHO, the perspectives on health widened. It can be undoubtedly said that India has aligned itself with the global needs and concerns. Some important landmarks in health sector at the international level are as follows:Alma Ata Declaration, 1978: The Declaration of Alma Ata was adopted at the International Conference on Primary Health Care at Kazakhstan in 1978. It is the first international declaration and hence an important landmark. The goal of this declaration was to achieve \u2018Health for all\u2019 particularly through primary health care.International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Cairo, 1994: The International Conference on Population and Development was organized by the United Nations to discuss various issues related to population such as immigration, infant mortality, birth control, family planning, education of women and protection for women from unsafe abortion services. The conference called for universal education, reduction in IMR, MMR and child mortality and access to safe methods for family planning.Millennium Development Goals, 2000: The United Nations declared Millennium Development Goals, 2000 to be achieved by 2015. The eight international goals under it were adopted by all 191 member states. These goals are:\nTo eradicate extreme poverty and hungerTo achieve universal primary educationTo promote gender equality and empower womenTo reduce child mortalityTo improve maternal healthTo combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseasesTo ensure environmental sustainabilityTo develop a global partnership for development\nWHO Framework for Tobacco Control\u2014WHO Geneva, Convention 2003: The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) treaty was adopted in the 56th World Health Assembly held at Geneva, Switzerland. It was signed by 168 countries. The treaty called for the protection of present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke.Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), 2016: The SDGs are a set of 17 goals to be accomplished by 2030. They cover issues including poverty, hunger, health, education, global warming, gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, urbanization, environment and social justice. Good health and wellbeing for people is the third goal states \u2018Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages\u2019 (Fig. 8.1) while clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, climate action and zero hunger are other important goals related to health.\n\n",
