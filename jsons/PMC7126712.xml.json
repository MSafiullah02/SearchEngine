A substantial amount of research has been dedicated to identifying factors that contribute to patient LOS in Emergency Departments (EDs) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Apart from the patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, race, mode of arrival, insurance status) and clinical factors (e.g., chief complaint, triage category), LOS is highly dependent on factors that are either at the ED or hospital level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The former includes disposition status, patient census, and bed occupancy rate, whereas the latter includes hospital census and inpatient bed occupancy rate 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Similarly, waiting times are another key indicator of ED performance, and prolonged waiting times can increase the risk of health deterioration 1, 6, 11, 12. Although there have been a few studies regarding the effect of non-urgent patients on crowding in the ED, little is known about how emergent patients affect crowding and the consequent service delay to the majority of non-emergent patients in the ED (12).",

Second, we calculated the median waiting time and LOS, and performed basic descriptive analysis of patient characteristics. Third, we used multiple linear regression to estimate the average waiting time and LOS of individual non-emergency patients to reflect levels of crowding with patient volume upon arrivals. Finally, we assessed the specific associations between the violation of the 120-min waiting time target of semi-urgent patients and the explanatory variables using logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) were used to represent the strength of the associations. We adopted the same explanatory variables as in the first analysis. Based on the model, we determined the discriminatory power of forecasting violation cases from the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC [AUC]), where a value of 1.0 represents perfect discrimination and a value of 0.5 represents no discrimination. We evaluated the goodness-of-fit using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. All the analyses were conducted in R, version 2.11.0 (available at http://www.r-project.org/).",

Specifically, in those studies done with ESI, there was a higher proportion of Category II cases (over 28%) and a lower proportion of Category IV cases (below 30%), whereas the corresponding figures are 4.0% and 49.3%, respectively, in this study. The very few Category II cases reflects the fundamental difference in triage systems, that is, that Hong Kong\u2019s system has rigorously defined Category II patients, many of whom would be placed in Category I in many other systems. On the other hand, we suspect the disproportionately large number of Category IV patients was partly due to our A&E staff\u2019s reluctance to triage patients to Category III, in which the recommended waiting time is much shorter. This disparity between the numbers of emergency and non-emergency patients has also been identified in other local studies 16, 24, 31.

            "text": "This study substantiates and quantifies the hypothesis that emergent patients in the A&E prolong waiting times and LOS for non-emergent patients, and that the emergent patients are associated with increased risk of violating waiting time targets for semi-urgent patients. Quality metrics that measure waiting times and LOS may need to include consideration of the relative burden of emergent patients and excessive non-emergent patients with limited resources for medical care who visit A&E Departments and EDs.Article Summary\n1. Why is this topic important?This study shows that an Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) has frequently failed to meet the waiting time target for non-emergent patients. It is imperative to determine the key factors contributing to the long waiting time and length of stay so that the service quality of the A&E can be maintained.\n2. What does the study attempt to show?Apart from the A&E misuse by a large number of non-emergent patients, this study attempts to investigate the impact of another important factor in the long waiting time and length of stay of non-emergent patients: the arrival of emergent patients.\n3. What are the key findings?This study finds that the emergent patients extend the waiting time and length of stay of the non-emergent patients, who make up the majority of A&E patients. This impact has been demonstrated to be statistically significant for both the individual and the entire group of non-emergent patients. Particularly important is that the emergent patients increase the probability of violating the 120-min waiting time target for Category 4 (non-emergent) patients.\n4. How is patient care impacted?This study provides insights on adjusting nurse staffing levels in response to a variety of A&E crowding situations, especially during a surge of non-emergent patients and sudden arrival of emergent patients. The real-time adjustment of nurse staffing level could improve patient satisfaction and enhance nurse morale.\n\n",
