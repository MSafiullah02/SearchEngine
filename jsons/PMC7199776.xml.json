            "text": "Trauma patients need to be effectively evaluated and treated in a limited timeframe. It is important to accomplish COVID-19 triage and preoperative evaluation as quickly as possible. During the epidemic, for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS) classificationI andII patients, it is recommended to conduct preoperative anesthesia evaluation through the electronic medical record. For American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) III andIV patients, face-to-face preoperative anesthesia evaluation is still recommended. In well-controlled regions (with intensive infection source control, strict community containment, and intensified active surveillance) with sporadic new cases, patients with epidemiological history or clinical symptoms related to COVID-19 are recommended to receive chest computed tomography (CT) scan, complete blood count, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test6; in the regions where the epidemic situation is not effectively controlled (with a large number of new cases), it is recommended that all emergency patients should receive chest CT scan, complete blood count, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Critical patients whose condition does not allow chest CT scan should be treated as suspected COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise. Special attention needs to be focused on the differential diagnosis of CT manifestation between pulmonary contusion (when consistent with the mechanism of injury) and COVID-19 infection. In case of difficulties in differentiation, enhanced levels of protection should be used. In the epidemic outburst area (with a large number of confirmed cases and a booming number of new cases), level3 protection should be implemented in all emergency surgeries due to increased risk of encountering asymptomatic patients,infected patients in the incubation period, or patients with false-negative screening results. Becausethe SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swab specimens has a low sensitivity, a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen (with a positive rate of 93%) might be considered after intubation. The result may better guide postoperative treatment.7 Treatment of critical trauma patients with COVID-19 infection is challenging. Patients with minor symptom may progress into severe cases during hospitalization. Early identification of high-risk patients can reduce the risk of adverse outcome.8 The treatment of patients with severe trauma must not be delayed due to COVID-19. The workflow of COVID-19 triage for emergency surgery during the epidemic is illustrated in Figure 1.",

All COVID-19\u2013related emergency surgeries should be performed under strict infection precautions. Anesthesia should be performed by a senior anesthesia clinician with another one on standby in the anteroom (yellow area) to provide further assistance. For patients with ASA III andIV classification or predicted difficult airway, an experienced expert should be available to assist. Detailed infection precautions for health care workers (HCWs) during anesthesia should be consistent with Perioperative Management of Patients Infected\nWith the Novel Coronavirus issued by the Joint Task Force of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology and the Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists.5 Anesthesiologists should implement level3 protection for surgical patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (Figures 2 and 3). Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned and doffed in a strict order according to one\u2019s specific institutional guidelines and under careful supervision of an infection control officer. Recommended PPEs for different levels of protection is shown in Table. It should be pointed out that use of PPE will inevitably hinder the visual, hearing ability, and hand dexterity of anesthesiologists, which will impair monitoring accuracy and the success rate of anesthesia procedures.9",

Operation can be performed when the negative pressure reaches \u22125Pka or lower.10 Warning signs of COVID-19 should be placed outside the OR. During the operation, it is necessary to keep the OR closed and restrict the number of HCWs who pass through the door. All unnecessary devices should be removed from the OR before surgery. Necessary devices, such as computers, anesthesia machines, and telephones, should be covered with disposable plastic wrap. The central suction system should not be used, and a substitute electric suction device is recommended. Adequate medications and fluids should be prepared before the surgery and placed in the OR away from the operating area.",

Regional anesthesia is preferred if it can meet the needs of surgery. Patients receiving regional anesthesia can use oxygen through a nasal cannula, with a surgical mask on top and a suction tube placed next to the mask. But for patients who are already on high-flow nasal oxygenation or mechanical ventilation or who have other indications for endotracheal intubation due to COVID-19,3 general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation should be applied. It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system. According to recent studies, SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in patients\u2019 cerebral spinal fluid and corpses\u2019 brain tissues.11,12 Some patients also demonstrated symptoms of intracranial infection, such as headache, epilepsy, and consciousness disorder.12 Therefore, for patients with viremia, neuraxial procedures that breach the dura may carry a theoretical risk of viral translocation, although early experience from the hospitals in Wuhan didnot show meningoencephalitis related to neuraxial anesthesia in COVID-19 patients.9 Becauseno guidelines have been established regarding the safety of neuraxial procedures, the decision should be made after discussion among anesthesia, surgery, and infectious disease colleagues and following a thoughtful discussion with the patient. Furthermore, nearly 20% of patients with COVID-19 have coagulopathy, and almost all the severe and critical patients have coagulation dysfunction.13 These conditions may represent a contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia.",

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have received intense attention because of positive results from small studies.14 But chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have many side effects, including toxic myopathy, retinal impairment, and even heart injury in rare cases. Some animal studies showed that administration of chloroquine could increase the severity of sevoflurane anesthesia\u2013induced neuronal apoptosis and memory impairment.15 There is also evidence showing that treatment with lopinavir\u2013ritonavir may significantly increase the placental transfer of bupivacaine enantiomers during epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery.16 Therefore, we suggest that thorough preoperative medication history should be collected, and special attention should be paid to the side effects of the COVID-19 treatment and its potential interactions with anesthetics. Furthermore, there has been speculation that consumption of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might worsen the consequences of infection.17 But strict avoidance of these drugs is ill advised, because there is no clinical evidence supporting these hypotheses yet.",

Modified rapid sequence induction is recommended for emergency trauma patients. We recommend cricoid force be applied by an experienced assistant to patients with high risk of gastroesophageal reflux. For suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, cricoid force should be used with caution because it may cause pharyngeal reflex, while its utility in preventing aspiration remains controversial. Propofol and rocuronium are reasonable drug choices for rapid sequence induction. Etomidate might be used in hemorrhagic shock patients, but its immunosuppressive effects are a relative contraindication to use in COVID-19 patients. Bag mask ventilation should be avoided after induction, while ventilation with low tidal volume and high frequency is recommended in case of severe hypoxemia. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, proper positioning of the endotracheal tube should be confirmed by chest movement and a waveform of end-tidal carbon dioxide (Etco2), rather than by auscultation. For patients with difficult airway, guidelines for difficult airway management should be followed. For patients with difficult intubation, but without difficult oxygenation, the most familiar airway devices (bronchoscope, video laryngoscope, or light wand) to facilitate endotracheal intubation after anesthesia induction were chosen. For patients with high risk of \u201ccannot intubate and cannot oxygenate,\u201d cricothyroidotomy or tracheotomy directly was proceeded. For patients complicated with hemodynamic instability, proper vasopressors should be prepared before induction.",

Level3 protection should be provided to HCWs extubating COVID-19\u2013related patients, and level 1 or 2 protection to HCWs extubating non-COVID-19 patients. Before extubation, suction of the lower airway and oropharyngeal sections should be performed with the patient in an adequately deep plane of anesthesia. Administration of propofol, dexmedetomidine, or remifentanil can be used to minimize the cough reflex during extubation.24\u201326 For COVID-19 patients, laryngeal mask exchange (Bailey maneuver) technique, which involves the replacement of an endotracheal tube with a laryngeal mask, is another way to create a smooth extubation. The Bailey maneuver can maintain a patent and unstimulated airway and allow for stable physiological observations and protection of the airway from soiling secondary to blood and secretions in the mouth.27 This technique is superior to either awake or deep extubation for patients with irritable airways.

These changes can further activate the coagulation cascade and inhibit fibrinolysis, thus promoting thrombosis.13 Therefore, perioperative thromboprophylaxis is of vital importance for trauma patients with COVID-19. Lin et al21 recommended that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulant therapy, together with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin, could be given to COVID-19 patients as early as possible when T cells, B cells, inflammatory cytokines, and d-dimer show the following trends: T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood are significantly lower than before; inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are increased significantly; coagulation parameters such as d-dimer are increased abnormally; and chest CT indicates the expansion of lung lesions.21 They recommended that anticoagulation therapy should be initiated in COVID-19 patients when the d-dimer value was 4 times higher than the normal upper limit, unless obvious anticoagulant contraindications were present. The recommended dose of LMWH is 100U/kg weight per 12 hours by subcutaneous injection for 3\u20135 days. However, for patients with high risk of postoperative hemorrhage or renal insufficiency, LMWH should be used with caution. Previous evidence has shown that early administration of tranexamic acid safely reduced death from severe bleeding in trauma.29 Therefore, early administration of tranexamic acid may be reasonable in traumatically bleeding patients with COVID-19. But when bleeding is not life-threatening, the thrombotic risk of tranexamic acid is too poorly documented to justify exposing COVID-19 patients to a plausible and inadequately evaluated risk.",
