            "text": "Allergic diseases are caused by an inappropriate initiation of Type 2 (TH2) immune responses to innocuous environmental antigens that affect the upper airway mucosa (rhinitis), lung (asthma), the gut (food allergy), and the skin (dermatitis) (Julia et al. 2015). Over the last two to three decades, the prevalence of allergic diseases has significantly increased and this has often been explained by a decline in infections during early life. It is thought that those who have had bacterial and viral infections during childhood are able to direct their maturing immune system (Table 11.1) toward a TH1 type and counterbalance any pro-allergic responses of TH2 cells (Yazdanbakhsh et al. 2002). The induction of a robust anti-inflammatory regulatory network by early life exposure to allergens offers a solution to the inverse association of allergen exposure with allergic disorders (Du Toit et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2014).\n",

Two features, antigenicity and immunogenicity, are generally used to describe each antigen. Immunogenicity is the ability to induce a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response. Antigenicity is the ability to specifically combine with the final products of the immune response (i.e., secreted antibodies and/or surface receptors on T cells) (Owen et al. 2013). Although all molecules that are immunogenic are also antigenic, the reverse is not true.",

Antibodies are produced as the result of immune induction, not from thin air. And antigens cannot trigger an immune response unless they bind with their corresponding antibodies or receptors. The above two concepts simply and repeatedly describe a single generality of all antigens, yet this alone does not allow us to completely characterize various antigens and cannot help us to understand antigens in various guises. However, different antigens produce different immune responses as they encounter their antibodies or receptors. Using this feature, antigens can be more accurately defined by the difference in the type of immune responses they induce.",

The immune system has its own mechanisms for maintaining a general physiological balance in life by co-operating with other systems of the body. Here, we attempt to redefine and differentiate antigenicity into immunogenicity and allergenicity. We refer to antigenicity as the ability of an antigen to induce an immunological response when it is encountered by the human body. Antigenicity involves two types of immune characteristics, immunogenicity, and allergenicity. Immunogenicity refers to the ability of an antigen to trigger normal and protective immune responses after being encountered by the human body. We describe the immunogenicity of an antigen using the following three aspects: (1) the ability to defend the immune system (immunological defense), which is the ability to repel an exogenous antigen and to fight against infection; (2) the ability to keep the immune system stable (immunological homeostasis), which is the ability of the body to recognize and eliminate damaged tissue, inflammation and/or senescent cells, and (3) the ability to kill and to remove abnormally mutated cells so as to monitor and inhibit the growth of malignancies in the body (immunological surveillance). Thus, immunogenicity reflects the strength of these three functions.",

            "text": "Allergies are a major cause of chronic disease in all countries of the world with the incidence of reported cases significantly increasing over the past two to three decades. This increase has often been explained by some experts as the Hygiene Hypothesis (Cramer et al. 2012; Liu and Murphy 2003; Maizels et al. 2014; Sherriff and Golding 2002), that is, a decline in infections during early life could predispose children to be susceptible to allergy and that exposure to microbial products such as endotoxin can reduce the risk for allergic sensitization during early childhood. However, on the contrary, allergic sensitization among adults and in the elderly increased with increasing endotoxin levels (Min and Min 2015). The same observation has been made for the development of food allergy. Early consumption of peanuts in infancy is associated with a low prevalence of peanut allergy (Du Toit et al. 2008, 2015). Higher maternal intake of peanut, milk, and wheat during early pregnancy was associated with a decreased incidence of mid-childhood allergy and asthma (Bunyavanich et al. 2014). The role of diet, therefore, has been highlighted as a key factor that influences immune homeostasis and the development of allergic diseases (Julia et al. 2015). There is no benefit to delaying the introduction of any potentially allergenic food, such as milk, eggs, peanuts, or fish food beyond 6 months of age to prevent food allergy (Chin et al. 2014). Regarding the development of inhalant allergy, a similar conclusion has been drawn but with an exception for mites. It was demonstrated that early exposure to high levels (\u226510 \u00b5g/g dust) of dust mite allergen was associated with an increased risk of asthma and late-onset wheeze at age 7 years compared with exposure to low levels (< 0.05 \u00b5g/g dust) of dust mite allergen (Celedon et al. 2007). Also, pet exposure during the first year of life and an increasing number of siblings were both associated with a lower prevalence of allergic rhinitis and asthma in school children (Hesselmar et al. 2008).",

However, if allergen avoidance really benefited the immune system, there would not be a need for the immune system to establish immune memory. On the other hand, different allergens belong to different groups (see Chap. 10.1007/978-94-017-7444-4_5 in this book). Single-allergen avoidance means avoiding an entire group of allergens, making complete avoidance impossible. Moreover, complete avoidance can cause malnutrition, mental retardation and lost enjoyment of life (Wang 2010). Even worse, avoiding the consumption of certain substances may trigger defects in the immune system. In fact, our meta-analysis concluded that allergen avoidance may not always be successful in preventing allergic symptoms (Wu et al. 2014), especially for newborns.",

            "text": "A study of the prevalence of allergy in adults demonstrated that infection with pulmonary TB contributes significantly to atopy, particularly allergic rhinitis symptoms (Lin et al. 2013). A pilot experiment showed the cross-reactivity between antigens from roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides (AL) and house dust mite (HDM) allergens (Acevedo et al. 2009). Another experiment with larger samples further demonstrated that AL-antigens can inhibit up to 92 % of HDM-specific IgE-reactivity among allergic subjects, while only up to 54 % of AL-specific IgE-reactivity among ascariasis subjects was inhibited by HDM allergens (Valmonte et al. 2012), suggesting that AL antigens have broader and higher allergenicity than HDM allergens and noting that the latter would sensitize up to 70 % of the allergic population (He et al. 2014). A further study from Hagel I et al. indicates that it only took a mild infection with A. lumbricoides (0\u20135000 eggs/g feces) to significantly elevate the levels of IL-13, IL-6, IL-10 as well as the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and no mention of IgE or IgG in this group, while in the moderately infected group (> 5001\u201350,000 eggs/g feces), IL-13 and IL-10 are very significantly increased but no increase of IgE, IgG, IFN-\u03b3, or IL-6 was observed in comparison with those in the urban nonparasitized control group. This result indicated that the protective response against allergy development by A. lumbricoides relies on IL-10 but is independent of the production of IFN-\u03b3, IgE, or IgG. These observations are complicated by concurrent infections with Giardia duodenalis and A. lumbricoides. A study evaluated the effect of A. lumbricoides on G. duodenalis infection and TH1/TH2 type immune mechanisms toward this parasite in 251 rural parasitized and 70 urban nonparasitized school children (Hagel et al. 2011). In the group of children mildly infected with A. lumbricoides, the levels of IgG, IgE, IL-13, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-6 are all very significantly increased, while in the group of children moderately infected with A. lumbricoides, only IL-13 and IL-10 are highly elevated and IFN-\u03b3 is significantly increased but with no significant effects on the levels of IgG, IgE, or IL-6. These results suggest that A. lumbricoides can modulate the immune responses by affecting both TH1 and TH2 type immunity (Hagel et al. 2011). Therefore, the conditions regarding the severity of the A. lumbricoides infection and whether or not co-infection with other species of parasites has occurred are very important in reaching the real conclusion. This information would have been helpful in a study (Palmer et al. 2002) that demonstrated in a cross-sectional sample of 2164 children that A. lumbricoides infection is associated with increased risk of childhood asthma and atopy in rural China but it did not contain detailed data on the above-mentioned two parameters. This could explain why previous studies of birth cohorts with participants in (sub)-urban environments that examined similar associations have yielded inconsistent results. In conclusion, the protective immune response induced by parasites in humans is dependent on the particular parasite (Ek et al. 2012) and, therefore, discussion of the protective effects without the antibody and cytokine measurements (IgG, IgE, IL-13, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6) or investigation into the presence of co-infection is limited and insufficient. It is tempting to conclude that A. lumbricoides has high immunogenicity and low allergenicity and that this type of circumstance could significantly contribute to the maturation of our immune systems.",

A study of gut commensals demonstrates that different rates of microbial colonization and infections with different bacterial types (Clostridia vs. Lactobacilli) would predispose children to allergy or no allergy (Sepp et al. 1997). This is similar to the situation seen with parasitic infections in children. The protective effect of infections strictly depends on the specific species and the microbial/parasitic burden. Thus, it is tempting to think that for immune system development and homeostasis, there are microbial and parasitic friends and foes that are very distinct and explicit. Therefore, to better characterize the antigen, it is crucial to know how harmful (allergenic) and how beneficial (immunogenic) the antigen is to the immune system.",

Exposure to a non-hygienic environment did not induce significant airway neutrophilia, yet it altered the number of immunologically active cells in the lung and reduced subsequent allergic inflammation (George et al. 2006). Further studies suggested that early exposure to unhygienic conditions and infections is associated with different expression of Toll-like receptors (Majak et al. 2009) and early exposure to a farm environment seems to influence methylation patterns in distinct genes (Michel et al. 2013), therefore, epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to the development of asthma and other allergies.",

            "text": "Based on what has been stated for early exposure factors in the previous sections, allergen number reduction results (see Chap. 10.1007/978-94-017-7444-4_5 in this book), and the Hygiene Hypothesis, we hypothesized that Balanced Stimulation by Whole Antigens is necessary for healthy immune system development. This hypothesis contains three essential parts: (1) Administration of all types of allergens in very early life contributes to the healthy maturation of the immune system and protects children from allergy development; those infants who miss exposure to one or some types of allergens during the key period of immune system expansion may develop atopy to these substances when they grow up. After a diagnosis of allergy, the affected cases would be treated by immunotherapy with these allergens. (2) Regarding mechanisms, the maternal immune status is a key factor in whether the fetus is primed for a TH1 or TH2 response. A balanced level of TH1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-10) provided by maternal T cells drives the direction of the homeostatic development of the initial TH0 cells of the fetus that are then further educated for tolerance during infancy and improved by a balanced stimulation with all types of allergens, even if the developing immune status is TH2-biased. Conversely, an unbalanced stimulation that lacks of one or more types of allergens in the first year of life would negatively influence the evolving balance and/or enhance any existing TH2-biased immune status, thus allowing the development of allergic disease. Furthermore, maternal milk, a tight link between mothers and their children, contains free dietary and environmental allergens, IgM/IgG/IgA, tolerogenic factors (such as interleukin 10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), lactoferrin, antioxidants, etc.), gut growth factors (such as cortisol, thyroxine, epidermal growth factor, TGF-\u03b2, etc.) and microbiota-influencing factors (such as prebiotics, oligosaccharides, casein, etc.). These factors can be transferred to the infant during breastfeeding. During childhood and adolescence (Fig. 11.1), tolerance develops to dietary and inhalant allergens and reinforces the immune system memory to these antigens (Julia et al. 2015). (3) There is a necessity for lasting memory T cells to be restimulated in order to sustain their immortality and immunotolerance capability. It is the exposure of antigens in a certain space-time continuum that stimulate and reinforce the development of the immune system. During the na\u00efve stage, early exposure to superantigens with attenuated allergenicity could potentially strengthen and confer immune system tolerance to their allergenicity-untouched natural counterparts\u2014this is similar to the process of allergen-specific immunotherapy. A good example comes from the progression of smallpox vaccination (Fig. 11.2). Smallpox vaccines were originally made with whole smallpox virus that then evolved over generations to being made with the cowpox virus, which was actually a type of allergenicity attenuation that resulted in a vaccine that could therefore be safely administered to humans for protection against the smallpox virus (Fig. 11.2). It is tempting to speculate that other infectious diseases (SARS, AIDS, Ebola, etc.) could be eradicated by vaccination with their allergenicity-attenuated counterparts.\n\n",
