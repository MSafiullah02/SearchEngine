IIP includes the entities of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia [1]. IPF is the most common form of IIP and is diagnosed on the basis of clinical characteristics such as high-resolution chest computed tomography findings, pulmonary function tests, and physiological findings [2]. If patients with IIP do not fulfill these criteria, surgical lung biopsies are necessary to classify the IIP as a particular type. The histopathological finding termed usual interstitial pneumonia of IPF involves a heterogeneous appearance at low magnification with alternating areas of normal lung tissue, interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and honeycomb changes [2].",

It has been reported that increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, and IL-7 and interferon \u03b3 are present during an acute IPF exacerbation [14]. IL-1\u03b2 upregulates IL-8, which is critical for neutrophil recruitment, and the BALF of patients with an acute IPF exacerbation is characterized by neutrophilia [14]. On the other hand, in vitro studies using human bronchiolar epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells described a complex network of RSV-induced stimulation, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, or both. RSV infection in human bronchiolar epithelial cells leads to the production of immune cell-specific chemokines such as IL-8. Early interaction of RSV with several Toll-like receptors on dendritic cells and monocytes releases proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 [15]. From these results, it appears that RSV infection-induced proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 recruit neutrophils and induce an acute IPF exacerbation.",
