This clade was formed mainly by trypanosomes of bats, and some other mammalian hosts in the Americas, Africa and Australia. Accordingly, it was proposed the bat-seeding hypothesis, in which a common ancestor bat trypanosome gave origin (speciation) to several trypanosomes that evolved linked to bats or have switched, by several independent events at different times, into a range of terrestrial mammals in the New and Old Worlds, then originating several lineages (monophyletic assemblages) of bat trypanosomes [1\u20135].",

One lineage represents the subgenus Schizotrypanum that harbours T. cruzi, which is a species found in bats and mammals of virtually all terrestrial orders from the southern United States to southern South America. The other species within the subgenus Schizotrypanum are all restricted to bats: T. dionisii found in bats from the New and Old Worlds, T. cruzi marinkellei of Central and South America, and T. erneyi of African bats [3, 5\u20139]. The second lineage (T. rangeli/T. conorhini) comprises two sister clades. One clade is exclusive of T. rangeli from humans, monkeys, rodents, xenarthrans, bats and other mammals. The other clade includes T. conorhini (tropicopolitan of rats), T. vespertilionis (European bats), and African trypanosomes from bats, monkeys and civets. The lineage of Australian trypanosomes from marsupials and rodents were basal to these lineages [1, 3, 4, 10].",

However, the relationships of the new trypanosomes with T. livingstonei and the Australian trypanosomes were unresolved [11]. In a likely evolutionary scenario, all trypanosome species within the T. cruzi clade evolved from an Old World bat trypanosome, possibly in Africa where the most basal species was found so far, and from where bats irradiated in the Eocene [1\u20134, 10]. Therefore, further surveys of the trypanosomes in bats of the New and Old Worlds are required to shed more light on the evolution of these intriguing parasites, and on the emergence of the human infective bat trypanosomes T. cruzi and T. rangeli.",

The species of Pteronotus live in warm regions near water sources and form large colonies in caves and under bridges often together with phyllostomid bats [21]. This genus is currently Neotropical and, in Brazil, Pteronotus spp. are quite common in Amazonia and Cerrado biomes, and were recently found in the Atlantic Forest of northeastern Brazil [22]. The Mormoopidae is sister to Phyllostomidae and closely allied with Noctilionidae, Furipteridae and Natalidae, which together form the Noctilionoidea superfamily widespread in the Neotropics and comprising one extant species of Myzopodidae in Australia, and a single species of Mystacinidae in New Zealand [23\u201327].",

The bats captured in Brazil were identified with morphological keys and representative specimens of each species (deposited in the Zoological Museum of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo) were confirmed using DNA from liver/blood samples preserved in ethanol for PCR amplification and sequencing of the Cytochrome b (Cytb) and the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes [28]. The barcode sequences were analysed by BLAST search in GenBank, and the bats were identified as P. parnellii, P. personatus and P. gymnonotus.

This trypanosome species was not detected in a large sampling of bats from other genera and families investigated so far by our and other research groups in this and in previous studies [9, 11, 15\u201319]. Phyllostomid bats captured in shelters shared with Pteronotus in Rond\u00f4nia, western Amazonia, were identified as T. c. marinkellei and T. dionisii [9]. Previous studies suggested some degree of specificity of trypanosome species to certain bat taxa. For instance, T. c. marinkellei appear to be composed of divergent trypanosomes and genotypes related to different genera of the Phyllostomidae family [9]. Also suggesting some host-specificity, T. livingstonei was identified in African bats of the closely related genera Rhinolophus and Hipposideros, whereas sympatric bats of Molossidae harboured T. erneyi [3, 4]. However, host-specificity of bat trypanosomes were still limited to data from a few surveys in general focused in the more abundant and easier to capture bat species, then precluding any strong associations of trypanosome species with bat hosts and geography.",

            "text": "T. wauwau was not infective to triatomines (Rhodnius robustus, Rhodnius neglectus and Triatoma infestans), which destroyed the parasites in their gut and haemolymph. Similar results were obtained for T. dionisii, T. erneyi and T. livingstonei [3, 4, 9]. The high prevalence of bats infected with T. wauwau suggested that this species should be transmitted by common vectors and routes. The Pteronotus bats captured were in general heavily infested with ectoparasites such as hippoboscid flies and ticks, but cimicids were not found in these bats. Cave-dwelling sand flies can be the vectors of bat trypanosomes as previously indicated for T. leonidasdeanei in Central America [41], and suggested by prevalent trypanosome infection in sand flies usually associated with bats [42]. Studies of ectoparasites and sand flies associated with bats are required, as done to demonstrate that cimicids cyclically transmit T. dionisii and T. vespertilionis in Africa and Europe [43]. However, mechanical transmission through the bites of ectoparasites, and oral infection through the ingestion of ectoparasites, are very probable among bats that live in colonies, and share grooming and feeding on the ectoparasites.",

The small kinetoplast occupied a lateral position adjacent to the rounded and nearly to the central nucleus (Fig. 6a). The trypomastigotes in the Pteronotus blood smears resembled those of T. leonidasdeanei and T. pessoai in Central and South American bats [41, 44], and the trypomastigotes found in blood smears of African bats infected with T. heybergi and T. livingstonei [4, 45]. Interestingly, blood trypomastigotes of T. wauwau were also quite similar to those of T. sp. from the Australian marsupial Trichosurus vulpecula, which clustered together with T. sp. H25 in the clade T. cruzi; so far the blood forms of T. sp. H25 remain undescribed [29, 46].",

There is also evidence that bats and a few rodents were the only placental mammals that successfully colonized Australia after its complete isolation, and before the animals brought by humans [48, 49]. The Australian trypanosomes within the T. cruzi clade were from kangaroo, woylie and possum, marsupials of the order Diprodontia of the superorder Australidelphia [1, 2, 29, 50\u201353]. The order Microbiotheria, which contains a single extant species, is the only Neotropical representative of Australidelphia. New World marsupials (Ameridelphia) are common hosts of T. cruzi, T. rangeli and other trypanosome species [45]. Noteworthy, intra erythrocytic parasites of Sarcocystidae molecularly identified from the South American and Australian marsupials shared a common ancestor [54]. However, phylogenetic studies revealed that trypanosomes from Australian marsupials are unrelated to one another, some species showed to be more related to trypanosomes of other hosts outside Australia, and so far no species could be linked to South American marsupials [50, 52, 53].",

Accordingly, trypanosomes from indigenous Australian mammals within the clade T. cruzi likely evolved from a bat trypanosome. Strongly supporting this hypothesis, a new trypanosome species found in an Australian bat (Pteropus scapulatus) showed to be related to T. rangeli [56, 57]. Therefore, besides the ancient great radiation of bats throughout the Word and more recent movements of bats across the land bridge of the Bering Strait and quite large oceanic barriers [1, 2, 4], a route in the southern supercontinent may also have played an important role in the dispersion of bats carrying T. cruzi clade trypanosomes. Our findings contribute to the discussion on the two competing biogeographical hypotheses: whether the ancestor trypanosomes of the clade T. cruzi originated in the New World or Old Word bats. The results gathered to date are more consistent with an Old World origin of the bat trypanosome ancestor of the T. cruzi clade. The present study provides relevant insights into the origin, dispersion, host-colonization and speciation of trypanosomes that shaped the T. cruzi clade. However, improved knowledge about Australian, African, and Neotropical trypanosome bats, as well as comprehensive molecular studies of bat trypanosomes from the Nearctic and Palearctic can be valuable to understand the origin and global distribution of T. cruzi clade trypanosomes, and to shed more light on the evolution of these intriguing parasites and the emergence of human pathogens.",
