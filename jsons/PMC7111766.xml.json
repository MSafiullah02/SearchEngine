            "text": "One topic of great interest in the last few years has been the evaluation of intestinal microbiota, which is the consortium of all living microorganisms that inhabit the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This new insight into the complexity of the intestinal microbiota, by the use of next generation sequencing techniques, and its intimate relationship with the host has spurred researchers to better understand the importance of a balanced microbial ecosystem for the regulation of host health and immunity (Suchodolski, 2016). In the last few years molecular methods, mostly targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA), have been used for identification of bacterial microbiota. This gene is ubiquitously present in all bacteria and archaea and contains both conserved and variable sequence regions, enabling researchers to distinguish organisms at different phylogenetic levels. Such approach has demonstrated that the gastrointestinal tract of both human and animals harbors a highly complex microbial ecosystem, consisting of several hundreds of different bacterial phylotypes (Handl et al., 2011). The importance of microbiota for the host is highlighted by murine studies that clearly indicate a reciprocal regulation between microbiota and T cell development (Williams et al., 2006; Round and Mazmanian, 2009; Lopes et al., 2016). In human medicine, variations of the gut microbiota have been correlated not only with gastrointestinal diseases (Frank et al., 2007), but also with obesity (Ley et al., 2005), allergies, autoimmune (Vieira et al., 2014; Block et al., 2016) and infectious diseases (Goedert, 2016; Tincati et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a systemic fatal disease affecting mostly young cats (Pedersen, 2014a) sustained by the feline coronavirus (FCoV), which commonly occurs in multicat environments. The FCoVs usually inhabit the intestinal tract (feline enteric coronavirus, FECV). During viral replication within the enterocyte, a mutated variant, also called FIP virus (FIPV) may be generated (Pedersen, 2014a). Whichever is the exact mutation, FIPV loses tropism for enterocytes and gains the capability to replicate inside macrophages (Kipar et al., 2010). Moreover, FCoV induces macrophage-monocyte proliferation in haemo-lymphatic tissues and thus allow a progressive viral adaptation to the replication within these cells (Kipar and Meli, 2014). Although both viral biotypes (FECV and FIPV) can spread systemically, only the FIPV may induce FIP, due to the higher rate of interactions between the virus and monocytes. Moreover, the host immune response has a pivotal role in the development of the disease. Indeed, the cell-mediated immunity seems to be protective. On the other hand, it is known that the humoral response induces development of antibodies that enhance the in vitro virus uptake in macrophages and this, in turn, contributes in vivo to the development of the clinical signs seen during the effusive (wet) form of the disease. The non-effusive (dry) form is considered as an intermediate status involving a partially effective cellular response (Pedersen, 2014a).",

In vivo, the suspicion of FIP is based on signalment and clinical history, as well as on laboratory data (Pedersen, 2014b; Stranieri et al., 2017a; Tasker, 2018).

Based on the total protein concentration, measured with the biuret method, and on the percentages of the electrophoretic fractions, the concentration (g/L) of each electrophoretic fraction was calculated. Moreover, feline \u03b1-1-acid-glycoprotein (AGP) was measured in serum using a radial immunodiffusion (SRID) kit (Tridelta Development Ltd), following the manufacturer's instructions (Duthie et al., 1997; Paltrinieri et al., 2007; Hazuchova et al., 2017). When present, effusion was analyzed by measuring total protein concentration with a refractometer, and cell counts using the Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology laser analyzer mentioned above. A cytologic evaluation was also performed. Particular attention was given to \u0394TNCC (the ratio between DIFF and BASO counts of the Sysmex XT-2000iV) due to its high diagnostic accuracy for FIP-related effusion (Giordano et al., 2015; Stranieri et al., 2017b). In two cases, due to the severe health conditions, it was not possible to perform an adequate blood sample for the screening analyses. However, a complete necropsy followed by tissue biopsies was performed in order to confirm the suspicion for FIP.",

The beta diversity graphically represents the distance between microbiological communities from each sample. No differences in the fecal microbiota were observed among the three groups. However, despite the low number of animals, in several cases, P values were close to statistical significance. The analysis of a higher number of animals is needed to confirm the impact of systemic infection on the intestinal microbiota, as previously reported in people (Goedert, 2016).",
