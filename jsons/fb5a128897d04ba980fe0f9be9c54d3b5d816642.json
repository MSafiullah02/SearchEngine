            "text": "from aqueous extract of four medicinal plants including Notopterygiumincisum Ting ex H. T. Chang, Isatisindigotica Fort. (IsatidisFolium ), Commelinacommunis L. and Isatisindigotica Fort. (Isatidis Radix), was developed by Dr. Yan De-xin, a famous Chinese medicine (CM) expert. The prescription has been employed in clinical use since 1960s for the treatment of exogenous fever and is well-received by patients in China and other Asian countries. Based on the rich practical experience in the treatment of epidemic diseases, the prescription had exerted signifi cant adjunctive effect for pneumonia induced by causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2004. These results provided indirect evidence for QZD's application to anti-influenza infection. However, treatment and prevention of H1N1 infection with QZD has not been investigated. The major components of QZD have been studied for their biological effects as following. N. incisumis reported to exert inhibitory effects on coronavirus, herpetic and hepatitis B virus; (7) (8) (9) Isatidis Folium has been shown to have activity against herpes simplex virus type \u2160 (HSV-\u2160); (10) and Commelinacommunis L. and Isatidis Radix have activity against influenza-virus in vitro. (11, 12) However, these four Chinese herbs in combination has not been studied for anti-H1N1 virus activity. The innate immune system within the airway and lungs can respond with rapid identification and elimination of invading virus by local and systemic inflammation. (13) Therefore, modulation of the host immune response has a potential advantage of exerting less-selective pressure on viral populations. In order to understand the protective mechanism of QZD, we hypothesized that QZD would induce distinct innate immune responses, and modulate the balance between suppression and activation of inflammatory cytokines to alleviate the lung injury. Therefore, we investigated antiviral effect of QDZ in lethal infl uenza A infection model and its immunodulatory potential in vivo and in vitro.",

While QZD had no antiviral activity in MDCK cells, it reduced mouse macrophage apoptosis, and suppressed the release of TNF-\u03b1 and RANTES from macrophage and endothelial cells after infl uenza virus infection. Combined with the data in vitro, our In the early lethal influenza virus infection, the prognosis of viral pneumonia depends on the innate immune response, in which cytokines and other inflammatory mediators are released from immune cells. Mice infected with influenza virus produce cytokine and chemokine responses, including IL-1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, RANTES, and ICAM-1 at days 3-5 post-infection. (9, 18, 19) The interplay of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, IL-18, IFN-\u03b3, and chemokines forms a complex positive feedback network leading to inflammatory response and the development of influenza-specific Th1 response. (20) TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 possess multifunctional activities, and are associated with morbidity during influenza virus infection. Chemokines, such as RANTES, induce the recruitment of innate immune cells into the lung, which can release more cytokines exacerbating cytokine storm and further damage the lung. (21) This study showed that the influenza virus transiently altered endothelial function expressed as ICAM-1. Endothelial dysfunction may be explained by the expression on the endothelial surface of adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, and promote the adherence of leukocytes with the consequent initiation of vascular damage. (19) RANTES, a member of the C-C chemokine family, is a chemoattractant for monocytes, T lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils, and expressed by endothelial cells and T lymphocytes. It has been found in nasal secretions of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract infection with infl uenza virus, parainfl uenza virus and adenovirus. (22) RANTES may contribute to the accumulation of these inflammatory cells into the epithelium during viral infection.",

The signifi cant antiviral effi ciency in vivo may due to suppression of cytokine/ chemokine/ICAM. Immune response is a doubleedged sword. The immune response presents a powerful barrier against virus and can target virusinfected cells. However, the uncontrolled immune response may cause more damage to host cells than could be attributed to the replication of the virus alone. (23, 24) Excessive infl ammatory cytokine released from immune cells leads to lung injury and dysfunction of respiratory system. Administration of QZD signifi cantly dampened interferon, cytokine, chemokine and ICAM-1 release into the bronchoalveolar lavage, and resulted in a signifi cant decrease in infi ltration of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils in the lung. In addition, we found that QZD had the ability to inhibit RANTES release by H3N2 infected A549 cells. As a result of no obvious cytopathic change in A549 cells 48 h after virus inoculation, the suppression of RANTES by QZD might not contribute to inhibition of virus replication. Influenza virus-infected monocytes and macrophages responded with a cell-specific response involving cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2). (25) We found that with the higher virus titer, QZD at the concentration of 30 \u03bcg/mL inhibited cell apoptosis, whereas with the lower virus titer, QZD reduced TNF-\u03b1 in Ana-1 cells.",
