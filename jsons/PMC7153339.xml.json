Chitosan-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated iron oxide NPs have been reported to make better intracellular delivery of a DNA repair inhibitor (O6-benzylguanine) to glioblastoma multiform cells and enable treatment monitoring by MRI. Dextran enables improved water solubility and stability of iron oxide MNPs while sulfated dextran can electrostatically interact with positively charged polycations.

The ongoing research is their application in biomedicine, imaging, and sensor applications is thought to have a major impact on the human lives. With the advancement of the applications of nanotechnology in sialic acid biology, a new term perhaps needs to be coined now as Sialonanotechnology encompassing the applications of nanotechnology is study of sialic acid biology in health and disease.",
