            "text": "There are two key needs in COVID-19 management: (i) to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection rate; and (ii) to reduce 20 death rate of those infected -the subject of this commentary. The current WHO estimated global mortality rate is 21 3.4% (March 2020) and the global death toll has now past 200,000 (April 2020). Without therapy the COVID-19 pan-22 demic is escalating exponentially: from the first reported death in Wuhan China 10th January 2020, it took 91 days for 23 the global death toll to pass 100,000 -then a further 16 days to reach 200,000. A vaccination program will take 1-24 2 years to roll out, once safety and efficacy is proven. Anti-virals are being sought mainly amongst repurposed drug 25 candidates but also with combinatorial screening of libraries, for example to block virus binding angiotensin 26 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -ACE2 providing the receptor on cells that allows viral entry. Cell-based approaches in-27 clude stem cells and exosomes but these will never meet scale of need whilst also carrying risk of viral transmission if 28 contaminated. Countries have introduced Population control with social distancing and lockdown to isolate individ-29 uals: this has reduced infectivity rate -\"R\" -where R denotes the average number of people an infected person will 30 spread the illness to. But, after lockdown, the virus remains: the probability of R increasing again is high. 31 The new danger is exit from lockdown. Here, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) represents an untapped resource to 32 boost the lung's own resistance to developing COVID-19 -reducing risk of severe disease as nations cautiously leave 33 lockdown to return to normality.

Bottom centre (adapted from Reference [16] ): Schematic of a healthy alveolus. The alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium are intact. The characteristics of the pulmonary circulation and intact epithelial endothelial barrier allow for formation of the alveolar wall liquid (AWL) while maintaining the air-filled, fluid-free, status of the alveoli. The AWL facilitates gas exchange and is a medium for dispersal of surfactant and alveolar macrophages, which is essential for maintaining alveolar stability and host defenses. The intact sodium-dependent vectorial transport across type II alveolar epithelial cells regulates the removal of excess alveolar fluid. Bottom right (adapted from Reference [16] ): Schematic of pathophysiology in ARDS. There is a loss of epithelial and endothelial barrier integrity and loss of function leading to increased permeability pulmonary edema. Solutes and large molecules such as albumin enter the alveolar space. In the presence of proinflammatory mediators and activated endothelium, leukocytes traffic into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. There is activation of coagulation and deposition of fibrin in capillaries and alveoli with increased concentrations of fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products in the edema fluid. Surfactant depletion and degradation result in large increases in surface tension and loss of alveolar shape and integrity. Recovery is preceded by fibroblast proliferation.

These Type II cells are the source 86 of LIF -not only reflecting the \"stemness\" property of Type II cells, but also 87 providing rapid release of tissue-protective LIF in response to infection. During Pneumonic Infection, alveolar macrophages are triggered to release 89 inflammatory cytokines: analysis of LIF in response to infection revealed 90 that all inflammatory cytokines induce LIF expression -with the one excep-91 tion -that being IL-6. IL-6 directly suppresses LIF [9,10] explaining the po-92 tency of IL-6 in driving cytokine storm once IL-6 becomes dominant. Note 93 also that IL-6 up-regulates vascular angiotensin type 1 receptor with propa-94 gation of oxidative stress and vascular endothelial dysfunction [11].

Crucially, LIF is able to directly oppose IL-6 activity -controlling 121 against cytokine storm. But over time, background levels of circulating IL-122 6 gradually increase, tipping the balance between LIF and IL-6 towards in-123 flammation, with reciprocal loss of LIF since IL-6 directly inhibits transcrip-124 tion of the LIF-receptor -in effect making cells blind to LIF [13].
