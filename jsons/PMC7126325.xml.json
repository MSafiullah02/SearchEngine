            "text": "The notion that viruses may be able to eradicate cancer has existed since the early 20th century [1], [2], [3]. Several viruses were tested both in experimental settings and in humans during the 1950s and 1960s. Among the first viruses to be used in a controlled fashion in clinical studies was a vaccine strain of rabies virus to treat 30 patients with melanomatosis, eight of whom showed tumor regression [4]. A few years later the oncolytic efficacy of adenovirus serotype type 4, which at that time was referred to as RI (respiratory infectious) virus, was tested in humans [5], as well as the flavivirus West Nile virus (strain Egypt 101) [3] and the paramyxoviruses mumps and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [6], [7]. Also, many viruses were tested in animal models. For instance, bovine enterovirus showed efficient lysis of syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent mice [8]. Moreover, many case reports describe the use of several different viruses, including ones with previously undescribed pathogenesis. In one larger study, 10 human and one simian adenovirus serotypes were administered to 30 patients with cervical cancer resulting in necrosis and transient tumor regression in some patients [9]. In another report, six different viruses were administered in succession to a patient suffering from acute leukemia [10], and a third report summarizes the use of 13 different viruses or strains in a total of 57 patients with various types of advanced cancer, with no oncolytic effects observed using any of the viruses [11]. While these studies were groundbreaking and provided the first glimpse of therapeutic potential in humans, the efficacy of the virotherapy was unimpressive and many viruses elicited side-effects which ultimately ended the trials. As a result, the initial interest in viruses as anti-cancer agents declined during the following decades, as deduced from the number of publications from that time, and studies were mainly conducted using experimental models. As an example, a report from 1982 describes the testing of the oncolytic potential of 16 different viruses in 180-sarcoma and Erlich ascites tumors in mice [12]. Later in the 1990s, with the advent of modern biotechnology and the concept of gene therapy, interest in viruses as a treatment for cancer was rekindled, and today virotherapy is asserting itself as a formidable treatment option alongside surgery, chemo- and radiation therapy. Many new virotherapeutic candidates are emerging in what could be called the second coming of viruses.",

            "text": "In addition to direct tumor targeting several alternative strategies for cancer gene therapy have been developed, which are addressed only briefly in this review. Foremost among these is tumor vaccination or cancer immunotherapy, which aims at evoking tumor-specific immunity capable of eradicating established tumors as well as maintaining immunologic memory [13], [14], [15]. Tumor-specific immunity may be stimulated e.g. by the production of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) either within the tumor cells themselves or in other cells, or via opsonization of tumor cells by antibodies produced by viral vectors. Another approach involves the enhancement of tumor cell recognition by T cells or dendritic cells which have been transduced with viruses encoding immunostimulatory cytokines. Many viruses evoke a strong immune response and may thus function as adjuvants, and hence oncolysis can be considered a two-pronged strategy where cancer cells are destroyed on one hand by direct action of viral replication and on the other, they become targets for recognition by the immune system. During the 1950s this idea spurred the development of so called oncolysates which were used in several human trials to vaccinate against cancer [14], [15]. One of the most promising studies was led by Dr. William Cassel who treated patients with stage III malignant melanoma with NDV-oncolysates [16], [17]. The oncolysates were prepared ex vivo using either existing or isolated melanoma cell lines from the patients to be treated, and then injected subcutaneously into the thigh and forearm of the patients. The treatment regimen was gradually increased from weekly injections to 3 month intervals after 10 years of continued therapy. Of the 81 treated patients, 63% were tumor-free after 10 years [18] and 71% of these remained tumor-free for the following 10 years, totaling a 20-year survival of 44% (see Chapter 9 in Ref. [19]). Nine of the 15 patients who died between the 10 and 20 year follow-ups were tumor-free and died of other causes. While this trial was limited and included only historical controls, it is encouraging and warrants further study on a larger scale. In comparison, although survival is highly dependent on the substage of the disease (primarily determined by the number of regional lymph nodes involved), the overall 20-year survival in 2002 of stage III melanoma was reported to be 23% [20]. In fact, despite aggressive chemo- and radiation therapy, the overall survival rates of the most common forms of metastasizing cancer have not improved in the past decades, casting doubt on the true usefulness of the conventional forms of treatment and emphasizing the need for alternative therapies [21].",

            "text": "Oncolysates have also been used later in clinical trials with some degree of success [15], [22], [23], but results have been ambiguous even using the same virus (Chapter 5, Ref. [19]). Still, when measuring overall survival, viral oncolysates have proven better than conventional therapies, possibly because of the detrimental effects chemo- and radiation therapy have on the immune system (discussed in Chapter 4, Ref. [19]). The relationship between viruses, cancer and the immune system is complex and may reveal surprising aspects. For example, a growing amount of evidence shows that vaccination against common human pathogens, such as influenza, vaccinia and tuberculosis, reduces the risk of developing melanoma later in life [24], [25], [26]. While the molecular basis for this phenomenon is still unknown, cross-protection between viral epitopes and cancer has been proposed to play a role. For other types of cancer where a particular virus is the etiologic agent, e.g. papillomavirus in cervical cancer and hepatitis B virus in hepatocellular carcinoma, vaccines against these viruses have proven highly prophylactic, but only rarely therapeutic for established cancers [27], [28]. Moreover, the controlled clinical or laboratory experiments aside, hundreds of cases of spontaneous remission have been documented since the beginning of the 20th century [29]. Although the underlying mechanisms of these remissions remain unclear, in many of these cases remission phase has been preceded by fever, which has spurred the notion of fever therapy for cancer [30]. It is likely that the immune system has played a significant role in clearing the tumor mass, possibly augmented by common infections. Elevated body temperature may also be beneficial for virotherapy. For instance, normal cells become more refractory to adenoviruses when cultured at high temperatures, whereas cancer cells may display even enhanced permissiveness [31], [32]. As far as oncolytic bacteria are concerned, at least attenuated Salmonella typhimurium and Clostridium novyi are being used in clinical trials to target various types of cancer (see www.wiley.co.uk/genmed/clinical/ and www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct).",

            "text": "Why are cancer cells such generous hosts for viruses, being preferred over other types of cells? Many genetic and physiological features specific for malignant cells relating to particular gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations explain this phenomenon. Cancer cells have undergone a mini-evolution, involving extensive point-mutations as well as larger chromosomal shifts and alterations, termed chromosomal instability, which provides them with selective growth advantages over normal cells [34]. However, while cancer cells may gain many growth-enhancing attributes, they may simultaneously lose critical components of the intracellular defense mechanisms and thus become fertile ground for the replication of many viruses. For instance, although many cancer cell types are resistant to apoptosis due to activation of Ras (gain-of-function), reovirus replicates better in these cells as the function of the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) is inhibited [35], [36]. Activation of Ras and the subsequent inhibition of PKR has also been thought to underlie the permissiveness of tumor cells to oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSV) which are deleted in the main neurovirulence gene \u03b334.5. Normally, the \u03b334.5 protein overcomes the restriction in replication posed by functional PKR, but in a recent report it was shown that even vectors deleted for \u03b334.5 can replicate in cancer cells in which PKR is functional [37]. In this case, defects in the PI 3-kinase pathway allow the \u03b334.5-deleted HSV genome to be translated.",

For instance, many types of cancer cells overexpress ICAM-1 and DAF, the receptors for coxsackievirus A21 [38], [39]. Another enterovirus, echovirus type 1, gains preferential entry to ovarian cancer cells due to overexpression of the I domain of integrin \u03b12\u03b21\n[40], and poliovirus infects cells expressing the CD155 receptor, abundant on many human cancer cell types [41], [42]. The alphavirus Sindbis virus gains preferential access to tumor cells as a result of overexpression of the 67 kDa laminin receptor [43]. However, for viruses which utilize receptors that are abundant also on normal cells the mechanisms that govern preferential replication in cancer cells are probably intracellular. For instance, despite that NDV or mumps virus use sialic acid as their receptor and alphaviruses use heparan sulphate or ICAM-1, all abundantly expressed also on many normal cells, these viruses show high cancer cell selectivity [44], [45], [46]. In these cases preference to cancer cell stems from the fact that many, if not most, tumor cells display an impaired anti-viral response due to failure of critical components of the interferon (IFN) response system (loss-of-function) [47], [48], [49], [50], [51]. In fact, one strategy to enhance the tumor cell specificity of oncolytic viruses is to mutate them to induce a more potent IFN response [52]. While this reduces the replication of such viruses in normal cells, cancer cells remain permissive to the viruses because they are unable to respond to IFN signaling.",

For instance, squamous carcinoma cells overexpress survivin which makes it possible to use therapies specifically targeting this gene [53]. On the other hand, for many viruses the molecular basis for preferential infection of cancer cells is less clear, and some viruses may even display anti-cancer effects that do not involve the direct killing of the cells. As an example, while the parvoviral NS1 protein interferes with many cellular processes and can induce apoptosis particularly in transformed cells, parvoviruses may exhibit oncosuppressive activity (in addition to oncolysis) which prevents cellular transformation and tumorigenesis [54], [55]. Even more perplexing, pre-infection of Balb/c mice with mouse parvovirus led to enhanced graft rejection of syngeneic sarcoma cells despite that these cells were refractory to infection by the virus [56]. In another study, replication-defective human cytomegalovirus vectors were able to halt tumor growth in distant metastases in mice without direct infection of the tumor cells [57]. Both these mechanisms remain largely unresolved but may still be used in cancer therapy in the future.",

Whereas the E1B protein of wildtype (WT) adenovirus prevents p53 from inducing apoptosis in response to infection, E1B-deleted vectors can replicate productively only in cells lacking functional p53. This requirement is not absolute, however, and seems to be influenced by other factors, including cell type [58], [59]. As another example, herpes viruses lose the ability to infect non-dividing cells by deletion of the thymidine kinase gene, thereby forcing these viruses to prefer tumor cells over normal cells [60]. Viruses which have been mutated to be dependent on certain molecular defects in cancer cells are called conditionally replicating (i.e. restricted to replicate only in permissive cells).

These terms, attributed to the vectors in a manner habitual to the particular sub-field of research they originate in, imply that the constructs are unable to spread from cell to cell by means of autonomous replication. In other words, although replication of the viral genome may occur, such vectors cannot produce progeny virions. Hence the more descriptive terms replication-deficient or replication-defective. A distinction can be made between replication-deficient vectors that contain the genes necessary for replication (but not the viral particle), e.g. replicons or capsid-replacement vectors, and constructs that do not express any viral genes at all, e.g. amplicons, virus based nanoparticles, VLPs, gutless vectors and pseudovirions. However, there is some discrepancy in the use of these terms, as, for example, some use the term VLP to describe replicons [61], while others use the it for particles completely devoid of viral genomes [62].",

The mutations abrogate the production of the viral capsid and/or envelope proteins, and thus eliminate both the possibility and the risk of a spreading infection. Exceptions to this rule exist, however, as some replication-deficient vectors expressing fusogenic membrane glycoproteins (FMGs) may allow the vector to spread into neighboring cells in the absence of an extracellular step involving a virus particle. In such systems, the truncated viral genome is passively transferred into new cells via the formation of multinucleated syncytia as cells fuse together, seen for example in cell cultures infected with members of the paramyxoviridae family [63]. In addition to facilitating virus spread, syncytiosome formation may be directly toxic to the cells and syncytia are also more readily recognized by the immune system, increasing the tumor-killing capacity of oncolytic viruses even further or conferring killing capacity to otherwise apathogenic constructs [64]. Viral genomes may also piggyback on exocytosed vesicles or jump from cell to cell through tight junctions, as has been documented for a variety of different viruses and viral vectors [65], [66], [67]. Moreover, some vectors may not be based on any specific virus yet still be packaged into VLPs. For example, the so called plasmoviruses are plasmids in which the sole viral elements are the encapsidation signal and the genes for the virion itself (capsid/envelope). Plasmoviruses have been shown to drive the production of foreign inserts under the control of a heterologous promoter and to propagate the \u201cinfection\u201d by production and budding of VLPs [68]. Whether deleted in the viral replicase or the structural genes, the cloning capacity of replication-deficient constructs is often impressive. However, due to the inability to produce progeny it is becoming clear that replication-deficient constructs lack in efficacy when compared to replication-competent counterparts [69].",

This means that viruses which are used to target cancer cells, i.e. oncotropic viruses, but do not kill them are not considered oncolytic. True oncolytic viruses, whether replication-deficient or replication-competent, meet the criteria above. Oncotropic viruses are taken up by human cells, but their genes are not expressed or the infection is abortive. Such viruses include canine parvovirus [62], baculovirus [70], [71] and canarypoxvirus [72], all of which are being developed into vectors for cancer targeting but none of which display intrinsic oncolytic capacity. Moreover, as many of the non-lytic viruses are highly immunogenic they may serve as adjuvants to boost anti-tumoral immune responses. For example, immunogenic viruses from the plant kingdom [73] and bacterial phages carrying TAAs [74] are being developed for tumor vaccination in humans.",

Although the molecular basis for this phenomenon is unknown, the number of viral particles taken up and uncoated seems to play a crucial role. This in turn, puts constraints on drawing conclusions about viral oncolytic efficacy when very high MOIs are used \u2013 cell death in such cases could also result from high viral load. Also, many viral gene products are in themselves potent oncotoxic agents and may be used in conjunction with other viral vectors or as single therapeutics. For example, the 15 kDa protein apoptin encoded by the VP3 gene of the chicken anemia virus and the gene product of adenovirus E4 open reading frame 4 are both cytotoxic to cancer cells but not to normal cells [76]. Expression of apoptin by adenoviral or parvoviral vectors enhanced their oncolytic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo without increasing cytotoxicity towards non-transformed cells [77], [78].",

As many human viruses have been implicated in carcinogenesis [79], the sudden \u201cconversion\u201d of an oncogenic virus into an oncolytic agent may seem implausible. Nevertheless, despite the continuous risk of insertional mutagenesis, leading to the unfortunate setbacks in a recent X-linked SCID gene therapy trial [80], retroviruses have not been excluded from being developed for virotherapy. In fact, significant effort is put into making these viruses safer, and recent breakthroughs with retroviral gene therapy indicate, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, that under certain conditions genomic integration can be beneficial [81], [82]. A recent study has shown that while altering the expression of some genes in human T cells, retroviral integration did not affect T cell function or cell growth [83]. Another vehicle extensively used in cancer gene therapy, the vaccinia virus (VV), expresses the E3L protein which has been shown in some circumstances to be oncogenic [84]. Even more surprising, the polyomavirus SV40, which has been extensively used to transform different types of cells, has also recently proven efficient as a cancer targeting vector [85]. In this vector the Tag protein responsible for cellular transformation has been deleted, and although the recombinant SV40 vectors still integrate, tumorigenesis has not been observed [86]. Moreover, despite that the Epstein\u2013Barr virus is associated with a number of different types of cancers and is therefore classified as a type 1 carcinogen, it has recently been developed into an expression vector for non-lytic tumor vaccination against B cell lymphomas [87]. The vector has been rendered safe (non-oncogenic and replication-deficient) by deleting two oncogenic genes and one gene critical for the lytic cycle of the virus. Another herpes virus with oncogenic properties, the human herpes simplex virus type 2, has recently been engineered for oncolytic cancer targeting by deleting the ribonucleotide reductase gene [88].",

Two genes of this group in particular have been the targets of modification in order to create tumor-specific viruses: E1A and E1B (E1B55K). Normally the products of these genes act in concert to force the host cell to enter S phase, a prerequisite for the rest of the viral replication process. Deletion of E1A will render the virus susceptible to the anti-viral mechanisms of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, specifically by blocking the G1 to S transition. Deletion of E1B, on the other hand, allows p53 to induce apoptosis in infected cells, aborting replication and spread of the virus. Therefore, productive replication of adenoviral E1-deletion mutants can only take place in cells deficient in Rb and p53. Most gliomas fulfill these requirements and thus become ample targets for selective oncolysis by adenoviral E1-deletion mutants [91].",

However, the specificity of E1B-deletion mutants to p53-negative cells is not absolute, as the these viruses still express the E1A protein which can override the block imposed by p53 in infected cells, eventually causing apoptosis even in normal cells. Also, the p53 status of the cell is not a reliable marker for permissiveness to E1B-deleted adenoviruses. In fact, the ability of such adenoviruses to replicate rather seems to be dependent on the nuclear RNA export machinery of the cell which is different in cancer cells compared to normal cells [32]. The lack of E1B can be compensated by drugs or hyperthermia, enhancing the replication of E1B-deleted adenoviruses.

            "text": "E1A-deletion mutants, such as \u039424 (dl922\u2013947), have shown superior oncolytic efficacy compared to E1B mutants both in vitro and in vivo [96], [97]. To further enhance the oncolytic efficacy of E1A mutants they can be engineered to express functional p53, such as the commercial vector ADVEXIN\u2122 (Introgen Therapeutics Inc.), which enhances late stage replication in p53-deficient tumor cells by inducing apoptosis and facilitating the release of new virions [98], [99]. This strategy is being implemented in several clinical trials [100]. However, since primary tumors often express low levels of the primary adenovirus receptor-the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-and since the oncolytic efficacy of adenoviruses directly correlates with the expression level of this receptor, adenoviruses may be limited in their tumor targeting potential [101], [102]. Therefore, several retargeting strategies have been developed. For example, the incorporation of tumor-targeting peptides into the fiber protein of adenoviruses has been shown to increases both the specificity and oncolytic efficacy in glioma cells [103], [104]. Similarly, placement of an RGD-motif into the fiber knob of a replication competent adenoviral vector dramatically enhanced its oncolytic efficacy in A549 human lung carcinoma xenografts in nude mice [105]. Moreover, a tremendous potential to retarget adenoviruses is provided by the possibility to replace the native fibers with the fibers from the more than 50 human adenovirus serotypes and several non-human adenoviruses identified so far. Human adenoviral vectors with fiber proteins from their canine or ovine counterparts show an expanded tropism in vivo, alleviating the strict dependence on the CAR receptor [106], [107], [108]. Exchanging the fiber protein from the human adenovirus type 5 to that from type 35 converts the tropism of adenoviral vectors to using CD46, often abundant on tumor cells compared to normal cells [109]. For an extensive review of adenoviruses, particularly their retargeting strategies, see [110].",

Further, vectors based on both porcine and bovine adenoviruses are available, showing efficient transduction of many human cell lines [112], [113]. The ovine adenovirus type 7 vectors OAdV623 and OAdV220 have been tested in animal models of cancer with good results [114], [115]. Finally, a recombinant vector based on the avian adenovirus chicken embryo lethal orphan (CELO) virus and expressing TK displayed (in combination with relevant prodrugs) modest oncolytic capacity in several human cancer cell lines in vitro and prolongation of animal survival in an immunocompetent mouse model for melanoma [116]. As with most non-human adenoviruses, CELO does not replicate productively in human cells and is therefore replication-deficient. It is possible to utilize these non-human adenoviruses in translational research and in the future they may be applied in clinical settings in humans.",

            "text": "Vectors based on herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 are, together with the adenoviruses, furthest along in their development and testing for virotherapy. To date, a plethora of HSV vectors is available and the number of both preclinical studies and clinical trials is rapidly increasing [117], [118], [119]. The first replication-competent vector, dlsptk, for cancer therapy (malignant glioma) based on HSV-1 F strain was described in 1991 [60]. This vector was deleted in the thymidine kinase (TK) gene but was shown to be oncolytic to human glioma xenografts in nude mice. However, although TK-negative HSV vectors are attenuated in normal cells, the absence of this gene eliminates the possibility to use commercial anti-herpetic drugs to control the infection. Therefore, most HSV vectors in therapy use today are instead deleted for the main neurovirulence gene \u03b334.5, which severely restricts their ability to replicate in the adult central nervous system (CNS) and to form latency. Indeed, \u03b334.5 deletion-mutants have been the first HSV vehicles to enter clinical trials [120]. However, in order to avoid the generation of wildtype (WT) HSV, the so called second-generation vectors have been deleted in several genes. Moreover, as it has become clear that deletion of the \u03b334.5 gene also reduces replication efficiency, modifications restoring the efficiency have been introduced. For example, the third-generation vector G47\u0394 has been deleted for the ICP47 gene, and shows increased replication efficacy and oncolysis in animal models compared to the parental G207 vector [121]. Deletion of the ICP47 gene also reduces viral downregulation of MCH class I molecules and thus enhances vector immunogenicity. To date, five replication-competent HSV-1 vectors have entered clinical trials: (i) the first-generation vector 1716, a recombinant based on HSV-1 strain 17 and deleted for the \u03b334.5 gene, (ii) NV1020 (formerly R7020), a chimeric second-generation recombinant of HSV-1 and HSV-2 with deletions in the UL24 and UL56 genes and in one copy of the \u03b334.5 gene, (iii) the second-generation vector G207 deleted in the ICP6 gene (ribonucleotide reductase) and both copies of the \u03b334.5 gene, (iv) OncoVEX\u2122 (GM-CSF) (BioVex, www.biovex.com), a recombinant vector deleted in the \u03b334.5 gene but engineered to express higher levels of US11 which compensates for the reduced replication efficiency, and (v) the HF10 vector, a multiple mutation recombinant HF strain of HSV-1 [117], [122]. Most of these vectors have proven safe, and phase II studies are ongoing.",

Also, as most recombinant HSV vectors are derived from the laboratory strains F or 17, they are less cytotoxic than clinical isolates due to culture adaptation. In this respect, a recombinant vector based on a clinical isolate of HSV-1 (strain JS1) recently showed enhanced oncolytic capacity compared to conventional HSV vectors, and due to ICP47 gene deletion it also elicited protective anti-tumoral immune responses [124]. Furthermore, the oncolytic capacity of many HSV vectors has been augmented by various inserts. An extensively explored strategy has been to produce cytokines and chemokines (e.g. IL-12 or GM-CSF) from the vectors to stimulate immune recognition and to establish tumor immunity [118]. Another strategy has been to express FMGs by HSV vectors, but it has even been possible to screen for recombinant HSV viruses with intrinsic membrane fusogenic properties by randomly mutating the (G207) viral backbone. Combining this built-in ability with the expression of foreign FMGs, a strategy used in the novel Synco-2D vector, has enhanced the oncolytic capacity even further [125].",

This construct, named FusOn-H2, was created by deletion of the ICP10 ribonucleotide reductase gene, corresponding to the ICP6 gene in HSV-1, which abrogates the tumorigenic potential of the vector and confers syncytia-forming properties. Indeed, when compared to the above mentioned Synco-2D vector and to Baco-1, another oncolytic vector based on HSV-1, FusOn-H2 demonstrated superior efficacy even after intravenous (i.v.) administration in a nude mouse model of human breast cancer. Making use of the natural tropism of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), a recombinant non-oncolytic vector based on the prototype strain B95.8 was recently created for targeting of B-cells which are otherwise notoriously difficult to transduce [87]. This vector, expressing GM-CSF, was able to induce maturation of DCs in vitro and to induce specific T-cell activation, and is thus being considered for vaccination against B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, it was recently shown that replication-competent bovine herpesvirus 4 was oncolytic for several cancer cell lines in culture and destroyed human A549 lung carcinoma xenografts in nude mice [126]. The observed apoptosis was shown to be dependent on the expression of viral genes. In addition to conventional HSV vectors, vehicles based on saimiri virus, the prototype of the \u03b3-2 subfamily of herpes viruses, have shown promise of becoming new virotherapeutic agents. These viruses can persist non-lytically in T-cells, and when engineered to express TK, they have shown significant anti-tumoral efficacy in animal models of leukemia [127]. Saimiri virus, and also pseudorabies virus (genus varicellovirus) which is currently being developed to a cancer targeting tool, is oncolytic in some cancer cell lines but strictly non-lytic in others [128], [129].",

Cancer cell death in response to VV occurs both by apoptosis and other mechanisms, and a clear advantage of the vectors based on this virus is their well-established safety profile in humans.

For instance, the yaba-like disease virus (YDV) has shown oncolytic potential both in vitro and in vivo [138]. Similarly, recombinant vectors based on myxomavirus, previously thought to infect only rabbits, were recently shown to efficiently kill several human glioma cell lines and primary glioma explants in vitro and to markedly prolong the survival of mice in two human glioma models [139].

For example, parvoviruses can inhibit the transforming capacity of other oncogenic viruses [140], and have been shown to suppress the proliferation of some cancer cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and terminal differentiation [141]. The non-structural proteins of parvoviruses can cause epigenetic modifications in cancer cells and revert them to a benign phenotype [55].

In another study, replication-deficient vectors based on AAV type 8 expressing anti-angiogenic soluble VEGF receptor were able to significantly halt tumor progression in several rodent models of glioblastoma and were more efficient than vectors based on serotype 2 [144]. Dupressoir et al. [145] demonstrated the oncolytic effect of the autonomous rodent parvovirus H-1 in a mouse model of mammary cancer, both when given i.v. or when mixed with the tumor cells. The virus used did not cause tissue damage and its replication in non-transformed cells was considerably attenuated, providing an important safety aspect. Similar results were reported by Dupont et al. [146] who used recombinant minute virus of mice. The virus infected a panel of cancer cells much more efficiently than normal cells. Recently, Wollmann et al. [131] demonstrated variable permissiveness of human glioma cell lines to two strains of the minute virus of mice. Finally, parvovirus types unable to infect human cells can be used to target human cancer cells by capsid retargeting. For example, a modified feline panleukopenia virus is currently being tested for feasibility as a cancer targeting tool [147].",

For example, marked inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival of immunocompetent mice was observed upon multiple i.v. injections in a model of lung-metastasizing mammary cancer [148]. In this study, the oncolytic efficacy was reduced in pre-immunized animals, indicating that pre-existing immunity poses an obstacle with this virus, but combining treatment with immunosuppression overcame the restriction. In another study, reovirus administered intracranially (i.c.) was able to eradicate breast cancer metastases in the CNS of nude mice and to prolong survival of immunocompetent rats with leptomeningeal breast cancer metastases when administered intrathecally [149]. The replication of these double stranded RNA viruses is inhibited in normal cells by the cellular anti-viral defense machinery, which is activated by recognition of the viral genome by the enzyme PKR. In many cancer cell types, however, reoviruses are able to replicate unhindered due to inactivation of PKR by the oncoprotein Ras. The main advantage of live reovirus is its well-established safety profile in man, and reovirus type 3 (Dearing strain) is currently being used in clinical trials (Reolysin\u2122, Reosyn\u2122, www.oncolyticsbiotech.com).

Although still being investigated, the specificity of these viruses to tumor cells likely stems from the inability of tumor cells to respond to type I interferons and to mount an anti-viral defense [49]. The history of NDV as an anti-tumor agent in humans began in 1965 with a clinical trial led by Dr\u2019s Cassel and Garrett who used the live attenuated 73-T strain to treat a patient with cervical carcinoma [156]. Subsequently, NDV has been used both as oncolysate and live virus in several clinical trials. As an example of the latter, in one study a purified poultry vaccine dubbed MTH-68/H based on live attenuated NDV was administered i.v. to a total of 14 patients with grade IV glioblastoma multiforme since 1996 [157]. Of these patients, five died of the cancer, two died of other causes and the remaining seven were alive at the time of the publishing of the paper in 2004. Four of these patients who had been alive for 5\u20139 years had received i.v. virus as their sole form of treatment. While these anecdotal results await confirmation by other independent laboratories using proper controls, they strengthen the supposition that multiresistant brain tumors may be treated by peripheral administration of a tumor-homing, replication-competent oncolytic virus.",

Despite that none of the 11 assessable patients in the NDV-HUJ trial or the altogether 113 patients in the three PV701 trials had durable responses, the viruses were well tolerated (less adverse events, including fever, in the NDV-HUJ trial than the PV701 trial), reaffirming the safety of NDV in humans. Moreover, in some cases tumor responses could with likelihood be ascribed to the virus treatment, which has warranted the continued development of these viruses for virotherapy. The NDV-HUJ virus is classified as being lentogenic, i.e. avirulent in poultry and not capable of producing infectious progeny in most tissues, whereas the PV701 strain and the other oncolytic NDV strains MTH-68/H and 73-T are considered mesogenic (moderately virulent in chickens). Over the years, the 73-T strain has also been used in humans in the form of oncolysates to target melanoma [16], [17], [18]. In a 20-year follow-up, the overall survival rate of 81 patients who had received the immunotherapy in addition to lymph node resection was 63% (see Chapter 9, Ref. [19]). The 73-T strain is perhaps the most potently oncolytic of the NDV strains studied to date [2], and has also re-emerged in experimental cancer treatment studies [69]. Additionally, a number of other strains, including Italien and the non-oncolytic lentogenic Ulster strain, have been used to target cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo with high specificity [160]. It has been reported that tumor vaccination using mixtures of non-oncolytic NDV and tumor cells may be more efficacious than using oncolysates [161]. Based on results from the numerous animal experiments and clinical trials conducted it seems NDV is an extremely safe oncolytic agent. For an excellent review of the oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus, see [2].",

Inspired by this, measles virus has been used to target lymphoidic cancer cells by exploiting its natural tropism for CD150 or SLAM. Both the parental virus and a recombinant vector based on the Edmonston B strain (a vaccine strain that was originally converted less pathogenic to humans by passage in tissue culture) were able to inhibit the growth of human lymphoma xenografts in SCID mice by either i.t. or i.v. injection [166]. Later, Peng et al. [167] demonstrated the feasibility of using a recombinant measles vector to preferentially infect and destroy human epithelial ovarian cancer cells in vivo via CD46, the main receptor for the attenuated vaccine strains of measles virus. In this study the virus was able to significantly prolong the survival of the treated mice. Moreover, a recombinant vector based on the Edmonston virus and engineered to express carcinoembryonic antigen caused marked regression of i.c. U87 glioma xenografts in nude mice [168]. This vector has entered a phase I clinical trial to treat glioblastoma multiforme. Recently, the oncolytic efficacy of the culture-adapted Moraten vaccine strain and the live attenuated Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps virus were compared to the Edmonston vaccine strain both in vitro and in vivo [46]. Results revealed that while the replication kinetics of the viruses differed in cultured cells, all three showed similar oncolytic efficacy upon i.p. administration in nude mice harboring human ovarian cancer xenografts. These strains are included in approved commercial vaccines and therefore have undergone comprehensive testing in humans certifying their safety. Other measles vectors are being used in clinical studies to target ovarian cancer, myeloma and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (www.wiley.co.uk/genmed/clinical; [169]).",

Altogether, many paramyxoviruses display remarkable potential as anti-cancer agents. In all cases mentioned above, oncolysis has required viral replication as UV-inactivated viruses have not mediated cell death.",

In a recent study it was shown that i.v. administration of replication-competent VSV to immunocompetent rats with hepatocellular carcinoma significantly prolonged survival [171]. Ectopic expression of a fusogenic mutant F glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus enhanced the oncolytic potency and extended animal survival compared to treatment with WT VSV [172].

However, recombinant VSV is still able to infect and kill normal fibroblasts and cause neurotoxicity at high doses, which may pose a problem in human use, and therefore prophylactic treatment with interferon to restrict the spread of VSV in normal cells has been considered [131], [174]. Another strategy has been to mutate the matrix (M) protein, which causes VSV to elicit a stronger IFN response and restricts its replication exclusively to cells with impaired IFN-signaling [52]. A recombinant VSV vector, VSV\u0394M51, with a single amino acid mutation in the M protein has recently been used to target experimental human glioma xenografts in nude mice and syngeneic breast cancer metastases in adult Balb/c mice [175], [176]. In these studies, the mutant virus was well tolerated when given i.v. and was able to cause marked prolongation of animal survival in both models. However, despite that the maximum tolerated dose of the mutant virus in the Balb/c mice was 100-fold higher compared to WT VSV, VSV\u0394M51 was lethal to nude mice when given i.c., showing that other mechanisms than susceptibility to type I interferons govern the neurotoxicity of recombinant VSV. Similarly to inactivated paramyxoviruses, dead rhabdovirus particles do not induce cell death. An excellent review of VSV as an oncolytic agent is provided in Ref. [170].",

In another study, this virus was able to cause complete tumor regression in a small number of athymic rats harboring i.c. human glioma xenografts upon intrathecal administration. In addition to the recombinant vectors, a live attenuated strain of poliovirus 1 has shown promise as an oncolytic agent [180].

An SFV replicon was more efficient than a first generation adenoviral replicon in eradicating subcutaneous MC38 colon carcinoma tumors in immunocompetent mice [189]. Additionally, expression of IL-12 from an enhanced version of the replicon significantly improved the oncolytic capacity of the vector and it was possible to achieve oncolysis in pre-immunized animals, albeit at 20% lower efficacy compared to na\u00efve mice. In contrast, in a study by Smyth et al. the oncolytic efficacy of SFV was clearly enhanced in pre-immunized mice compared to na\u00efve animals, demonstrating that alphaviruses may also serve as an adjuvants in treatment of established tumors in vivo [61]. Similar to studies with Sindbis virus, repeated administrations of SFV did not reduce the efficacy of the treatment nor bring adverse effects. Although replication-competent SFV proved more efficacious than the corresponding replicon particles, tumors regrew once the treatment was stopped. Moreover, the replication-competent virus in this study was based on a moderately virulent strain of SFV and is thus less likely to be used in humans than an avirulent strain. Our own experiments showed that a replication-competent vector based on the avirulent A7(74) strain of SFV was able to destroy several cancer cell lines in vitro as well as human melanoma xenografts in SCID mice upon systemic administration [45]. Despite prominent homing to the tumors, the vectors retained their inherent neurotropism and established a persistent infection in the brains of the mice. Neurotropism may serve as an asset in targeting CNS tumors which are notoriously difficult to reach by surgery.",

Perhaps the most frequently used retrovirus to target cancer is the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). Due to the lack of active nuclear transport of the viral genome, all gammaretroviruses, including MoMLV, are unable to transduce non-dividing cells, which can be considered an important safety aspect. Complete transduction of human U87 glioma xenografts in nude mice was reported following a single i.c. administration of a replication-competent MoMLV vector [190]. Gliomas appearing at sites remote from the primary inoculation spot also stained positive for the viral envelope, suggesting that replication-competent retrovirus can be used to transduce tumors of the CNS with high efficiency. Furthermore, virus was not detected in any non-tumor tissue which demonstrates its specificity. In another study, replication-competent MoMLV vectors expressing HSV thymidine kinase (TK) were able to sensitize syngeneic glioblastoma cells in Lewis rats to ganciclovir and achieve up to 20% long-term (40 days) survivors [191]. Notably, this effect was not seen using replication-deficient vectors. Retroviruses have been used in clinical trials to treat cancer, but data from these studies suggest that the dissemination of the vectors in solid tumors needs to be improved in order to reach clinical efficacy [192], [193], [194].",

For example, using equal amounts of infectious virus, VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were shown to transduce a wide variety of tumor cells almost 10 times as efficiently as vectors based on adenovirus serotype 5 [195]. Like their retroviral counterparts, lentiviruses are not oncolytic. However, they do have the capacity to transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells, which may be advantageous under certain circumstances. In contrast to both gammaretroviruses and lentiviruses, the spumavirus foamy virus shows intrinsic oncolytic capacity. In a recent study, replication-competent vectors based on the prototype strain of this virus were able to control subcutaneous U87 tumors in nude mice for up to 25 weeks [196]. Although the vectors were observed to integrate in normal cells throughout the body of the infected mice, foamy virus vectors have in another study been shown to integrate in a pattern different from other retroviruses, with no apparent preference for active gene areas, and may thus be safer than these viruses in gene therapy applications [197].",

            "text": "A natural explanation for the discrepancy between results from animal studies and the clinics is the difference in host physiology, which may severely confound the assessment of the safety and efficacy of viruses in humans. For example, the pathways of complement activation are different in humans and in mice [199]. Another reason is that many human viruses do not replicate well in murine cells, and differences may even exist between rodent species. For example, experimental data suggests that VV, VSV and avirulent SFV replicate better in human than in mouse cells [8], [8], [45], [134], [175]. Andreansky et al. [200] reported that while glioma cells of both mouse and human origin were permissive for vectors based on HSV-1, glioma and other types of cancer cells from rats were not. Likewise, parvoviral strains show strict host-dependence, exemplified by the rat H-1 parvovirus which does not replicate in mouse cells, making analysis of tropism difficult in mouse models of human cancer. Unpublished observations by Cornelis et al. [54] reveal that the H-1 virus shows greater oncolytic efficacy against human cancer cells than does the prototypic minute virus of mouse (MVM) against the murine counterparts, supporting the development of the H-1 for human cancer therapy but making direct comparisons between these viral strains difficult based on studies in mouse models. Further, a common misconception is that SCID mice lack all capability to respond to viruses. In fact, despite being severely immunocompromised, SCID mice can mount an innate immune response including cytokines, complement, macrophages, NK cells and granulocytes. It was shown that neutrophils contribute significantly to the oncolytic efficacy of a recombinant attenuated measles virus vector expressing GM-CSF in SCID mice harboring human lymphoma (Raji cell) xenografts [201]. Also, the use of nude mice as a model for human cancer, although informative, has not correlated well with the therapeutic efficacy obtained in man [202]. The role of the subcutaneous xenograft model in immunodeficient mice (nude or SCID) should not be emphasized beyond its indicative value.",

The vesicular stomatitis virus, a well known human pathogen which does not cause extrovert symptoms in man, gives rise to progressing neuropathology in adult mice with fatal outcome [203], [204]. Reovirus type 3 constitutes a similar contradiction, causing a fatal infection in immune-deficient mice called the black foot syndrome, but no disease in man. In addition, strain-dependent differences within virus families may muddle the assessment of pathogenicity in humans based on study of a single member of the family. For example, whereas the Indiana strain of VSV is lethal to many rodents, the New Jersey strain is considerably attenuated at least in adult hamsters [205]. The VSV strains currently used in virotherapy of cancer are more attenuated still, carrying several point mutations that enhance the interferon response towards these viruses and render them safe in humans [52].",

The same is true for adenoviruses, which display strict host-dependence and rarely infect cells of another species, although expression of the early genes and cytotoxicity does occur.

            "text": "Highly variable tumor transduction was observed in several tumor model systems using replication-deficient adenovirus vector [216]. While increasing virus load augmented delivery, transduction remained incomplete and plateaued off at a dose around 2.5 \u00d7 109 virus particles. The transduction efficacy was inversely proportional to tumor size; small tumors were transduced more efficiently than large ones [217]. In a study by Grote et al. [166], the oncolytic efficacy of live measles virus was better in small (<0.4 cm3) tumors than in large ones and also better with local delivery compared to systemic. Upon histological examination of extracted tumor nodules, heterogenous virus dissemination was observed, indicating physical barriers to virus spread. Similarly, Bilbao et al. [209] demonstrated limited access of adenoviral vectors to experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following both intra-arterial and intraportal delivery. In this study, the thickness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding tumor nodules was of critical importance, restricting access of the virus as the capsules grew in thickness (and the nodules in size). Also, a progressive increase in components of the basement membrane substantially reduced tumor permissiveness. Some of these barriers could be alleviated using vasoactive compounds, such as histamine or nitroglycerin, which revealed the tumor microvasculature to be largely responsive for accessibility into the tumors. However, despite increasing access from the blood, the vasoactive compounds did not bring complete transduction, and the permissiveness was highly dependent on tumor morphology, indicating that internal barriers still remained. In yet another study, despite optimized tumor targeting capacity of a modified adenoviral vector to CAR-independent tropism (CD46), very limited transduction of tumor metastases in the liver was observed following i.v. infusion and mainly into metastases and tumor nests with a visibly thinner extracellular matrix between endothelial cells and tumor cells compared to untransduced tumor foci [215]. This study was extended by Li et al. [214] who demonstrated using adenoviral vectors in immunodeficient mice carrying liver metastatic xenografts from a number of different human cancers, a relationship between the transducability of tumor cells and the availability of blood vessels adjacent to them. The authors showed that only those tumor cells that were in close proximity to the blood-vessels were transduced and that the ECM indeed posed a significant barrier to virus dissemination.",

            "text": "From these studies (and many others not listed here) several important conclusions can be drawn: first, viruses delivered via the vasculature must cross the blood vessel endothelium and any layer of matrix that may separate the endothelial cells from the tumor. Research has shown that viruses delivered i.v. are much less efficient in transducing tumor nodules that exceed a critical size, correlating with both the thickness and the stage of maturation of the capsule surrounding the nodules. This threshold may be different depending on the type and location of the tumor, both of which affect the degree of ECM deposition, but in general the tumor size will be a restricting factor for any macromolecular drug delivered via the circulation. Second, dissemination of virus within the tumor mass will be incomplete if only a single injection is given either intratumorally or at a remote location (whereby infection occurs via the blood). The degree of transduction will be dependent on virus dose and can be increased by multiple dosing or vaso-dilating compounds, but internal barriers within the tumor mass may still cause the infection to proceed unevenly. Third, host-derived connective tissue, including components of the basement membrane and the ECM, acts as a passive barrier to viral spread. K\u00f6pf\u2013Maier and Kestenbach elegantly describe the kinetics of xenograft growth of 13 different human tumors in nude mice, showing that after an initial phase of cell death, mouse fibroblasts rapidly form strands of connective tissue into and around the tumors, providing substrate for the formation of blood-vessels, which in turn sustain the regrowing tumor tissue [218]. Normal host cells, including fibroblasts, are almost without exception refractory to the oncolytic viruses employed today, and the ECM itself may function as a decoy for virus binding, adsorbing the viral particles and thus preventing the infection of the tumor cells. It has also been shown that the ECM functions as a molecular sieve; whereas the movement of large particles (\u223c150 nm diameter) such as herpes viruses is hindered, smaller nanoparticles (\u223c20 nm) diffuse more easily through the matrix [219].",

            "text": "In addition to the physical barriers mentioned above, solid tumors contain physiologically different sub-compartments which may influence virus entry, diffusion and half-life. For example, in areas of necrosis or calcification, common to growing tumor masses in vivo, the prevailing microenvironment is characterized by hypoxia, acidosis and enhanced proteolytic activity, which may affect the virus particle itself or modify the cell surface of nearby live tumor cells in an unfavorable manner [220]. Moreover, the elevated interstitial pressure of solid tumors and pressure gradients within the tumors may repel viruses, preventing them from entering and spreading in the tumors. Internal pressure in solid tumors and nodules is demonstrably increased, constituting a clear obstacle for delivery and dissemination of other types of macromolecules [221], [222], [223], [224]. Finally, not only the size of the tumor mass, but also its bodily location influences the homing capacity of oncolytic viruses. Myers et al. [46] recently demonstrated residual tumor mass in most mice bearing human ovarian cancer xenografts treated i.p. with three different oncolytic viruses (two strains of measles virus and one mumps virus). Despite direct contact with the intraperitoneal cavity, the surviving tumors were located in the greater omentum which seemingly was not accessible by the injected viruses. In another study, although replication-competent poliovirus was able to find and eradicate subcutaneous tumors following a single i.v. injection, xenografts of the same cancer cells implanted in the brain were not cleared by peripheral administration and required i.c. virus injection to be affected [179].",

            "text": "Many solid tumors contain a necrotic core which is palisaded by live tumor cells. Whereas the actively proliferating tumor cells are found outermost, virus antigen is frequently detected dispersedly at the interface between necrotic and viable tumor cells (see references in the previous chapter). This typical pattern of transduction as well as the fact that in many of the studies above both live virus and live tumor cells have been found, have spurred the notion of a dynamic equilibrium between infected dying cells and live tumor cells [166], [167]. According to this model, the respective growth kinetics of the virus and the tumor cells determine the outcome of the treatment. In the simplest scenario, tumors that grow as fast as or faster than the virus are not destroyed and therefore have a chance to regrow once the virus has been cleared. In immunodeficient mice, such a dynamic equilibrium could be maintained indefinitely [225], whereas in normal animals the immune system will probably eliminate the virus and tilt the equilibrium in favor of the tumors (unless also tumor-immunity is achieved).",

Moreover, physiologically distinct subpopulations of cancer cells emerge within the tumor mass, termed microheterogeneity, which provides an additional impediment to any form of monotherapy [226]. For example, many oncolytic viruses show reduced replication in growth-arrested cells, common in hypoxic tumor regions. Finally, as viruses themselves are prone to adapt and mutate, the model of dynamic equilibrium is inadequate to describe the entire process of tumor oncolysis. Therefore, more elaborate mathematical models have been developed which take into account some of the confounding aspects that prevail during the interaction between viruses and cancers [227], [228]. Although still oversimplified, such models may prove valuable in studying and optimizing oncolytic virotherapies. They also show that in addition to growth kinetics, the degree of tumor permissiveness influences the outcome of the virotherapy.",

Due to severe defects in the DNA repair machinery the genome of a cancer cell is highly malleable and undergoes several mutations during clonal expansion in vivo or passage in vitro [229]. The loss of other cellular functions, such as death-inducing pathways, also can make cancer cells particularly difficult to eradicate. Indeed, a common feature of the most severe malignancies is the development of resistance to both chemo- and radiation therapy, termed multiresistance. As cancer cells have the ability to adapt to almost any challenge, why would the concept of developing resistance to viruses be any different?",

The virus-resistant cells probably formed due to the selective pressure exerted by the virus or due to adaptive mutations in the tumor cells, which may have eliminated virus receptors or otherwise put the cells in a non-permissive state. Consistent with the concept of microheterogeneity, we could clearly show that the virus-resistant cells constituted only a portion of all cancer cells isolated from the residual tumors. They were likely to have contributed to tumor regrowth and ultimate failure of the therapy. Several other researchers have raised the possibility of virus-resistant cancer cells [69], [209], [212], [225], [230], [231], but despite promising tumor responses, e.g. to repeated dosing, none of these studies have analysed the emergence of such cells over the course of virotherapy by detailed scrutiny using both histochemistry and explant culturing. As an exception, in one study live tumor cells isolated from human lung carcinoma xenografts 21 days after treatment with oncolytic bovine herpesvirus 4 were still susceptible to the virus, which is in contrast to our findings [126]. However, it is likely that virus-resistant cells do not form equally fast with all viruses and that the isolation technique plays a role in finding these cells.

            "text": "Resistance of cancer cells to many different viruses may be promoted in vitro by multiple rounds of infection at low MOI, followed by passaging and re-infection of the surviving cells. This technique has been employed to generate tumor cells resistant to e.g. rat H-1 parvovirus [232], [233], coxsackie B virus [234], minute virus of mice [235], encephalomyocarditis virus [236] and adenovirus [231]. However, in many cases the so-called resistant cells have been persistently infected and resistant only to virally mediated cell death, in contrast to the cells obtained in our study which were resistant also to virus entry or replication. The distinction is important, as persistently infected cells may still be susceptible to cell death via cytotoxic gene products encoded by viral vectors. Recently Alain et al. [230] demonstrated using reovirus type 3 that persistently infected Raji cells (derived from Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma) could be rendered virus-free by treatment with neutralizing antibody. Remarkably, despite remaining resistant to virus in vitro, these \u201ccured\u201d cells were efficiently killed by the virus in xenografts in SCID mice. This phenomenon was ascribed to the in vivo proteolytic tumor microenvironment which processed the virion into a form capable of infecting the resistant cells. The study by Alain et al. shows that virus-resistant cancer cells generated in vitro may be still be killed by oncolytic viruses in vivo. In contrast, however, the virus-resistant melanoma cells that emerged in vivo in our study remained resistant throughout the study (also in vitro), suggesting that such cells are distinct from virus-resistant cancer cells generated in vitro. Therefore, assessing the presence of virus-resistant cells in tumors that survive oncolysis in vivo may be more informative than to screen for virus-resistance in vitro.",

These findings may have wider implications for combination therapy with oncolytic viruses and cytotoxic drugs. Interestingly, upon gaining resistance to virus, parvovirus-resistant cells lose their tumorigenic capacity, i.e. become revertants\n[55]. The tumorigenicity of the virus-resistant cell lines acquired in our own study [45] has not been established. It is possible that these cells have also become revertants but it is currently unknown whether the same is true for other viruses and whether tumor reversion occurs in vivo. Nevertheless, even if virus-resistant cells lose their tumorigenicity, they may still limit the success of virotherapy by posing a passive barrier to virus spread, tilting the dynamic equilibrium in favor of tumor growth. In this respect, it has been observed that infection of cancer cells with oncolytic herpes viruses induces apoptosis of neighboring cells, which may adsorb budding virions and prevent the infection from spreading [238]. Indeed, inhibiting apoptosis in cultures by chemical drugs considerably enhanced the oncolytic efficacy of the vectors. Thus, by inhibiting cell death, viral oncolysis could in fact be enhanced \u2013 a highly provocative idea which all the same may provide means to increase the success of virotherapy.",

The resistant mass was shown by histological examination post mortem to have arisen from the same original tumor. Thus, despite that the therapy virus may show efficient replication in a particular tumor mass in a patient, it may fail to do so in another of the same type in the same patient. The possible reasons for this striking phenomenon were discussed, but the spontaneous conversion of the tumor cells into a virus-resistant phenotype was not studied further. A similar case was reported in a study to treat glioblastoma multiforme using the lentogenic NDV-HUJ strain (given i.v.), where the tumor regrew in one patient after an initial complete response despite ongoing virotherapy [158]. The emergence of phenotypically indistinguishable but genetically different subclones of glioblastoma is not uncommon and may underlie the observed increased resistance to virus. The ongoing virotherapy may additionally have exerted selective pressure that provided growth advantage. In any case, it seems that tumor regrowth cannot be dismissed as mere incomplete transduction or poor toxicity \u2013 the underlying reasons may be related to intrinsic resistance to therapy (Chapter 5, Ref. [19]).",

Other types of tumor cells have also been observed to escape recognition by the immune system during ongoing immune surveillance [241], [242], [243].

For simplicity, such a cell could be labeled omniresistant. In order to avoid this, successful treatment should include a combination of synergistic therapies. This puts even more pressure on the precise and scientifically backed planning of treatment regimens and to elucidate common molecular targets that enable facilitation between different forms of treatment. Ideally, the molecular mechanisms of cell death in virally infected tumor cells should be put into context with the mechanisms that prevail during chemotherapy, cytokine therapy or radiation therapy in order to reveal the optimal molecular and genetic targets for intervention and ultimately, to provide a tailored therapy to which the cancer cell is defenseless. Not surprisingly, combination therapy is nowadays considered the only veritable option using adenoviruses, and monotherapy employing other viruses may be just as limited.",

            "text": "Several clinical trials have been conducted using common human pathogens that are considered innocuous, e.g. influenza virus, coxsackievirus, measles, mumps and adenovirus. However, as cancer patients run an increased risk of opportunistic infections by such cold-producing viruses, sometimes with severe consequences, complications may arise also during virotherapy [152], [153], [154]. As all viruses are potentially immunogenic they may, particularly at high doses, elicit unwanted side-effects. For example, at the therapeutically efficacious doses of 1012 particles, adenoviruses administered i.v. elicit transient liver inflammation and low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation which despite the good biosafety data accumulated to date is a problem [95], [246]. The unfortunate death in 1999 of a patient suffering from ornithine decarbamylase deficiency treated with high-dose adenovirus serves as a grim reminder of the perils involved in using viruses in humans. Although harmless during endemic infections, given directly into the blood these viruses bypass the body\u2019s inherent defenses and may elicit a potentially fatal systemic response. Another setback for viral therapy of human diseases occurred in France where three children with severe X-linked immunodeficiency treated with retrovirally transduced T cells developed leukemia related to viral integration and activation of the LMO2 oncogene [80]. Other patients treated similarly before this trial have recently begun to show clonal dominance in their immune cell repertoire, owing to the integration of retroviral vectors [247]. This underpins the fact that despite their capacity to correct immune-related monogenetic disorders, integrating vectors come with serious risks that need to be controlled.",

            "text": "Pre-existing immunity may pose a problem for the efficacy of virotherapy (discussed in the next chapter), but in some cases it may also result in exacerbated toxicity. For example, intratumoral treatment of Balb/c mice harboring subcutaneous syngeneic breast cancer xenografts with an adenoviral vector led to significantly increased toxicity in pre-immunized mice (60% mortality) compared to na\u00efve mice (15% mortality) at doses from 2 to 6 \u00d7 1011 particles, corresponding to the highest doses used in humans [248]. Pre-existing immunity prevented the transduction of peripheral organs but at the same time increased liver toxicity. In addition, therapy with high-dose virus may cause depletion of cytotoxic T cells or anti-viral interferons by a process known as immune exhaustion, compromising natural tumor immunity and reducing the efficacy of tumor vaccination, and rendering the host susceptible to further viral infection [249], [250]. This may have implications for virotherapy involving repeated dosing. Moreover, undesired side-effects may emerge during combination therapy where two (or more) treatment modalities may act synergistically to potentiate toxicity. For example, a portion of SCID mice harboring i.p. human ovarian cancer xenografts died when treated with gemcitabine and a retargeted \u039424 adenovirus, presumably due to liver or bone marrow toxicity [251]. The sensitization of normal cells to either the drug or the virus was offered as a plausible explanation for the occurrence. Finally, all oncolytic viruses may not be equally suitable for targeting tumors in sensitive locations, such as the brain, and the route of administration may also impact biosafety. For example, adenoviral vectors expressing HSV TK have been shown to cause CNS demyelination in mice upon i.c. inoculation [252]. In a study to target leptomeningeal metastases in rats and non-human primates, administration of adenovirus expressing TK into the cerebrospinal fluid followed by i.v. ganciclovir lead to viral meningitis, and a clinical trial was recently aborted as intrathecal retrovirus-TK therapy evoked severe toxicity in one patient [253].",

However, while virotherapy with some viruses seems to benefit from pre-existing immunity [61], the replication of at least HSV and adenovirus in immune hosts may be limited. Delman et al. [254] found that in contrast to high-dose treatment (107 PFU), i.v. low-dose (106 PFU) administration of either G207 or NV1020 failed to reduce the number of tumor nodules in pre-immunized mice with liver-metastasizing colorectal carcinoma. However, the oncolytic efficacy at the lower dose was not diminished if the viruses were given in close proximity to the tumor mass via intraportal injection. Similarly, in a mouse model of advanced peritoneal gastric cancer these vectors were unable to halt tumor growth when given i.v. instead of i.p. [255]. Thus, even replication-competent HSV vectors lose oncolytic efficacy when administered at sites remote from the tumor, and high doses of virus may be required to achieve efficacy in systemic virotherapy. Moreover, vectors based on HSV-1 and murine leukemia virus are prone to inactivation by complement [213], [256].",

Pre-existing immunity may also reduce the oncolytic capacity of reoviruses administered i.v., exemplified by a study to treat metastatic tumors [148]. In this study, immunosuppressive drugs and/or T-cell depletion significantly augmented virus spread in the tumors, prolonging survival and providing increased long-term cure.

            "text": "Recently, a number of strategies to enhance the delivery of drugs into solid tumors have been proposed [219], [220], [224]. For example, given the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses (presented in Chapter 8.1), pre-treatment with proteolytic enzymes, e.g. hyalorunidase or collagenase, could alter the ECM and thus facilitate virus penetration. Also, increasing the oxygenation of tumors to relieve hypoxia and to lower the interstitial pressure has been proposed to resensitize the tumors to radiation and facilitate drug delivery by normalizing the vasculature. This could be achieved by a number of strategies, including inhalation of hyperoxic gas, induction of local hyperthermia or blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. Vaso-active or vaso-normalizing compounds such as bevacizumab, bradikynin, low-dose paclitaxel or leukotrienes have also been used to increase the blood-tumor permeability. However, in one study even vaso-active drugs were not able to enhance adenoviral transduction of solid tumors exceeding a critical size [209]. This phenomenon has been corroborated later by a number of other observations and it has been proposed that the contribution of blood-vessel permeability to macromolecular penetration becomes dispensable in well-established fenestrated tumors where internal barriers are more likely to play the major role [224]. Also, while efficacious in increasing tumor permissiveness to viral vectors, vaso-active compounds may simultaneously increase the risk of tumor escape and metastasis (discussed in [209]). Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that pre-treatment of tumors with compounds that alter the microenvironment has a beneficial effect by resensitizing resistant tumors and by relieving some of the physical barriers to macromolecular delivery. Since tumor transduction by viruses in most cases is incomplete, particularly when the tumors have exceeded a certain size, pre-treatment to enhance virus delivery is likely to become a critical step in virotherapy.",

Five consecutive injections of an oncolytic herpes virus provided dramatically enhanced transduction in large (490\u2013695 mm3) tumor xenografts compared to single injection of the same total dose, leading to complete responses in all the treated animals [260]. As many oncolytic viruses are based on common human pathogens, pre-existing immunity will rapidly clear the viruses and thus multiple dosing will probably be required for successful virotherapy. However, despite providing enhanced efficacy in many experimental settings, even this strategy may be limited due to internal barriers that remain in the tumors [95], [219]. Also, in the case of intracranial tumors, repeated i.t. injections may not be feasible. Therefore, other strategies, such as continuous delivery via catheter and convection-enhanced delivery have been applied to increase tumor transduction within the CNS. The latter strategy is being used in a prospective phase I/II study to treat glioblastoma multiforme using liposomally encapsulated SFV replicons [261].",

Despite that many membrane-fusogenic viruses have long been used to target cancer, the notion of using their fusogenic properties as separate anti-tumorigenic entities or in conjunction with other viruses has only recently been implemented in practice [263], [264]. While FMGs are already by themselves capable of killing cancer cells, they augment virotherapy even further by facilitating virus spread within the tumor. For example, expression of a fusogenic mutant F glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus from a VSV vector enhanced its oncolytic potency and extended animal survival compared to WT virus [172]. Likewise, expression of the hyperfusogenic envelope glycoprotein of the gibbon ape leukemia virus from a replicon vector based on Sindbis virus brought significant enhancement of therapy efficacy in the U87 i.c. glioma model in nude mice [265].

In this respect, adenoviruses have undergone the most intensive research and a multitude of adenoviral vectors with altered tropism is available (reviewed in [110]). Retroviruses can be efficiently retargeted to specific cells by pseudotyping them with suitable surface glycoproteins (not just VSV-G) [269] and autonomous parvoviruses can be retargeted by modifying the capsid protein [147] Also, incorporation of tumor-specific peptides into several different gene delivery systems, including viruses, has been shown to significantly augment the targeting of many cancers [270]. For example, the tropism of measles virus has been made strictly cancer cell specific by expression of receptor-binding regions of single-chain antibodies on their surface, which also minimizes infection of non-tumor cells expressing the natural measles receptors CD64 or SLAM (CD150) [271]. However, peptide sequences incorporated into the surface glycoproteins of viruses may also function as tethers for tumor-specific antibodies. For example, lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with a modified E2 glycoprotein of Sindbis virus capable of accepting the Fc portion of IgG molecules displayed increased specificity to human melanoma cells in SCID mice when the viruses were incubated with specific antibodies prior to i.v. inoculation [272].",

For example, elimination of the SP-1 and SP-2 genes of vaccinia virus (strain WR) significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of the virus for two human and one mouse primary cell line while simultaneously increasing its toxicity for transformed or p53-negative counterparts [132]. Treatment with either IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 or both at the same time failed to abolish replication of the virus in the transformed cells. Upon i.p. administration in mice, the modified vaccinia vector localized to subcutaneous tumors with greater specificity than its WT counterpart, while vector titers in peripheral organs were reduced compared to WT virus. Similarly, deletion of the TK gene from VV strain Wyeth significantly diminished the capacity of the virus to replicate in non-transformed non-proliferating cells, thus enhancing its tumor-specificity [134]. Introduction of mutations restoring replication efficiency to the conventional \u03b334.5 deleted HSV vectors has been shown to significantly enhance oncotoxicity without compromising virus attenuation [123].",

Targeting hypoxic cells has the additional benefit of being a generic strategy which may apply to all solid cancers and thus is less likely to be dependent on specific molecular defects in the cancer cells, which may vary with cell type and be prone to mitigation by compensating mechanisms and overlapping pathways. An analogous strategy is to make use of the enhanced proteolytic microenvironment in tumors. This strategy has been implemented on measles virus which was rendered apathogenic in mice by engineering the activation of the fusogenic membrane glycoprotein F, necessary for infection, to be dependent on matrix metalloproteases (upregulated in tumors) rather than on furin [273].

Also, the Vpr nuclear protein of HIV-1 causes cell cycle arrest in susceptible cancer cell types and has successfully been used in experimental immunocompetent settings to eradicate cancer [276]. Interestingly, no anti-tumor effect was observed in nude or SCID mice. Finally, oncotoxic inserts do not have to be proteins. Using short hairpin RNA expressed by a lentiviral vector to inhibit survivin mRNA gave good results in a nude mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma [53].

Even so, for many viruses, including adeno-, herpes- and reovirus, transient immunosuppression has proven highly advantageous. For example, pre-immune IgM, which is present in the plasma of both rats and humans, has been shown to restrict the transduction capacity and spread of replication-competent HSV vectors administered intra-arterially [213]. Treatment with the B-cell immunosuppressive agent cyclophosphamide abolished this inhibition and allowed more efficient transduction of CNS tumors, increasing the survival time of the animals. In another study, treatment efficacy with reovirus of mice bearing multiple metastases of colorectal cancer was dramatically enhanced by pre-treating the animals with cyclosporine A [279].",

            "text": "In order to increase the safety of immunogenic viral vectors in humans, particularly as objective tumor responses often require large virus doses, strategies to desensitize the immune system have been developed. For example, priming the innate immune system with recombinant IFN-\u03b1 prior to VSV administration reduced replication but significantly increased the threshold of virus toxicity in immunocompetent rats [174]. This strategy could potentially allow the use higher virus doses in humans than currently possible. A related strategy, the administration of low-dose virus before the actual therapeutic dose is currently being implemented in a number of clinical trials to minimize virally elicited immune-dependent toxicity [182]. However, adverse events may occur despite apparent tolerance to repeated virus dosing, as evidenced by a severe systemic inflammatory reaction that developed in a patient after the fourth dose of the dl1520 adenovirus via the hepatic artery in a clinical trial to treat liver-metastasizing gastrointestinal carcinoma [92]. Moreover, in addition to suppressing or desensitizing the immune system, viruses can be made less immunogenic. One strategy has been to mask viruses by polymer-coating. For adenoviruses, this method has enabled the simultaneous enhancement of targeting specificity and evasion of neutralizing antibody [257]. Another strategy involves the encapsulation of viruses in non-immunogenic liposomes, a technique currently employed in phase I/II studies to target glioblastoma multiforme with SFV replicons [261]. Also, simply by choosing an appropriate producer cell line, the half-life in the blood of certain viruses can be dramatically improved. For MLV, complement-mediated inactivation in human serum was reduced severalfold depending on the cell type used [256].",

As viral oncolysis and tumor vaccination are overlapping concepts, the integration of immune-stimulating modalities into oncolytic therapy, most often cytokines and chemokines, is gaining support. For example, expression of IFN-\u03b3 from a conditionally replicating adenoviral vector enhanced the oncolytic efficacy compared to the backbone virus, both in a human xenograft and a syngeneic mouse model for liver cancer [277]. Importantly, expression of IFN-\u03b3 led to the eradication of also large (>1 cm3) xenografts not achieved with the parental virus, which is encouraging when considering that large tumors are often refractory to oncolytic viruses (Chapter 8.1). In another study, expression of human GM-CSF from a targeted VV vector JX-594 in rabbits with metastasizing liver cancer proved highly efficacious (hGM-CSF is biologically active in rabbits, in contrast to mice) [134]. Further, expression of IL-12 from SFV replicons has increased their efficacy in vivo [189].

For instance, in one report the beneficial effects of virotherapy were enhanced in combination with radiation therapy, and the authors speculated that possible resistance to virus may be overcome by introducing multiple treatment modalities [59]. In another study, adenoviral vectors engineered to silence the cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 gene through antisense RNA were shown to sensitize otherwise resistant cancer cells to cisplatin in an animal model of liver cancer [280]. Moreover, one of the most prominently upregulated genes in multiresistant cancer cells compared to non-resistant counterparts is the gene for Y-box protein (YB)-1 [281]. Several strategies are therefore being developed to target YB-1 in order to resensitize these cells to conventional forms of therapy (i.e. chemo- and radiation therapy). In one study, treatment of prostate cancer cells with a modified conditionally replicating adenovirus, Xvir03, led to enhanced nuclear localization of YB-1, which resulted both in enhanced virus replication and increased sensitivity of the cells to chemotherapy [282]. The authors of this study termed the notion of using one form of therapy to sensitize cancer cells to another through a common molecular target mutually synergistic therapy. As another example, adenoviral vectors engineered to express a dominant-negative NF-\u03baB inhibitor, I\u03baBM, rendered HeLa cells susceptible to TNF-\u03b1 mediated apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, facilitating the release of virions and spread of the virus [283]. Finally, in clinical trials of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, the conditionally replicating Onyx-015 vector was able to achieve only a \u223c15% tumor response on its own, whereas combining virotherapy with chemotherapy increased the efficacy to a level where 19 of 30 patients had an at least 50% reduction in tumor size and 8 patients were cleared of the cancer [93], [94], [95].",

For instance, when used together, recombinant HSV was found to enhance the release of AAV in pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [284]. Also, since it is known that echovirus infection leads to the upregulation of ICAM-1-the cellular receptor for coxsackievirus A21-in infected ovarian cancer cells, it has been proposed that the combined administration of these viruses could lead to enhanced oncolysis [40]. Several clinical trials using combinations of two or more different vaccinia vectors in conjunction with chemotherapy have been started [136]. Moreover, one virus can be used to drive the production of another. Particularly the large dsDNA viruses, such as the herpes-, adeno- and poxviruses, are capable of accommodating very large inserts, including other viruses. For instance, hybrid HSV vectors have been used to drive the production of retroviral amplicons in target cells, enabling significantly enhanced tumor targeting as the transduced tumor cells become producer cells for the amplicons [285]. Parvoviral replicons have been integrated into adenoviruses, and despite that the parvoviral NS1 protein initially prevented vector production, hybrid vectors were obtained in producer cells that expressed anti-sense RNA against NS1 [286]. Furthermore, adenoviral vectors were recently engineered to produce SFV replicons via a tissue-specific promoter [287]. Here the natural tropism of adenoviruses was used to target the vector to liver tumors in rats, while tumor-cell specificity was ensured using the \u03b1-fetoprotein promoter and robust gene expression and cytotoxicity by SFV. This is an example of combining three strategies in one system to enhance both specificity and toxicity, while at the same time preserving safety.

One reason for this is the inadequacy of animal models to mimic cancer in humans, a problem which could be addressed by using more sophisticated models and by taking maximum advantage of the ones already available. The mechanisms of tumor survival should be elucidated in order to avoid the generation of cancer cells resistant to both conventional treatment and virotherapy. As results from both preclinical and clinical virotherapy studies accumulate, it is becoming increasingly clear which forms of therapy offer the best chances of success. In addition to oncolytic virus(es), the optimal treatment regimen in most cases probably includes a combination of radiation, chemo- or immunotherapy. However, while apparently effective, the combination of two or more treatment modalities in one host may introduce additional variables into an already complex equation, possibly with dire consequences. One prominent concern is the use of replication-competent viruses in patients with compromised immunity, e.g. after radiation therapy. Another is the difficulty to estimate the extent of the immune response to rapid oncolysis, particularly at high virus doses. Therefore, detailed knowledge on immunological mechanisms and greater understanding of the molecular interactions between viruses and other forms of treatment is needed.",
