Total serum T4 concentration was 15 nmol/L (reference range, 19-65 nmol/L) and was considered consistent with a sick euthyroid state. On abdominal ultrasound examination, both kidneys were slightly small at 32 mm in length (reference range, 38-46 mm) 1 and had bright corticomedullary bands of unknown clinical relevance. An ECG confirmed bradycardia and 3rd-degree AV block. An echocardiogram identified dilatation of all 4 chambers consistent with chronic bradycardia-induced neurohormonal activation leading to sodium and water retention. The cat was treated with 0.3 mg terbutaline PO q8h. A transient decrease in systolic blood pressure to 80 mmHg was identified by Doppler sphygmomanometry but blood pressure stabilized between 120 and 140 mmHg after 2 days. Three months after discharge, the cat was reported to have more energy and had no additional collapsing episodes.",

            "text": "Partial seizures are described as simple when consciousness is not impaired or complex when consciousness is impaired. Partial seizures of both types can develop into generalized seizures. 2 Partial seizures are variable in presentation but may include orofacial automatisms, repetitive movements of an extremity, repetitive vocalization, circling, and salivation. 3 Patients suffering from partial seizures may have identifiable pre-and postictal periods that can assist in the differentiation between seizures and syncope. There are exceptions however and the lack of identifiable pre-and postictal periods does not preclude the diagnosis of a seizure disorder. 4 Partial seizures occur commonly in cats secondary to a variety of pathologies including both intracranial disease such as inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, traumatic, parasitic (cuterebral myiasis), vascular lesions and extracranial causes such as hyperthyroidism and hepatic encephalopathy. 3 Intracranial causes of seizures, especially neoplasia rather than primary epilepsy, are more common in cats 47 years of age. 3,5,6 During a generalized tonic clonic seizure, cats may exhibit opisthotonus, claw extension as well as running movements and loss of consciousness. 3 All 3 of the cats in this series had episodes that resembled clusters of complex partial seizures. There was no epileptiform activity seen on the EEG in 1 cat, which suggests the episodes were not because of seizure activity, but humans with frontal seizures may have no EEG abnormalities. 7 The EEG activity in the cat was obscured by movement artifact during actual collapse, and consequently epileptiform spikes may have been missed. 8 In humans, EEG recordings during syncope differ from those recorded during epileptiform activity in the following ways: the EEG tracing in syncope shows high amplitude generalized slow waves initially, the trace then becomes flat during the period of anoxia or hypoxia followed by the resumption of slow waves before the trace returns to normal. In humans there is no epileptiform activity during or between episodes of syncope. 8, 9 Complex partial seizures as well as generalized seizures can be associated with preictal ECG changes, these most commonly are sinus tachycardia but sinus bradycardia is also reported. 10 Patients with increased intracranial pressure may also have bradycardia with systemic hypertension (Cushing's Reflex). 11 Therefore, the presence of ECG abnormalities should not preclude investigation of intracranial disease.",

            "text": "Syncope is defined as temporary loss of consciousness and postural control with spontaneous recovery. 17 In a study of humans, syncope was induced by hyperventilation, orthostasis, and Valsalva maneuver in 56/59 volunteers. 9 Interestingly, 90% experienced either focal, multifocal or generalized myoclonic jerks, or a combination; 79% experienced oral automatisms consisting of lip licking, chewing, and fumbling, which classically would be attributed to partial seizure activity. Forty percent experienced visual and auditory hallucinations and 1 patient experienced vertical nystagmus. In humans with syncope, myoclonic jerks and convulsions occur because of transient hypoxia and are the rule rather than the exception. The episode duration usually is shorter than what is observed during an epileptic event. 8 Oral automatisms during syncope tend to be of shorter duration than those observed during a seizure but there is substantial overlap, making clinical differentiation impossible. 8 Cardiac arrythmias cause cerebral hypoxia that can either induce true seizure activity or can have characteristics of seizure activity. This situation is referred to as anoxic-epileptic seizures or anoxic seizures, respectively. [18] [19] [20] [21] Anoxic seizures first were described in 1983 18 and are defined as nonepileptic events because of abrupt interruption of the energy supply to metabolically active cerebral neurons. 19 They occur in both children and adults and often are misdiagnosed as seizures. A review of 74 adults with apparent seizures, 36 of whom were receiving anticonvulsant therapy were reinvestigated. Almost 42% were found to be experiencing syncope secondary to prolonged bradycardia or severe hypotension. 22 If the period of anoxia is long enough, however, a generalized tonic clonic seizure can occur. A case report of a 3-year-old girl describes a generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting approximately 2 hours after she lost consciousness as a result of a prolonged breath holding incident. 23 A study of eye witness accounts of humans experiencing collapsing episodes found that humans were 5 times more likely to have had a seizure if they were seen to experience postictal signs such as disorientation after the collapse. Postictal signs were reported to be the most useful discriminating factor between seizures and syncope. 24 Another study of humans assigned a point system based on historical criteria to assist in the differentiation of syncope and seizures. The system had 94% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Patients experiencing a seizure were more likely to have had mood changes, hallucinations, or trembling characteristic of preictal signs before loss of consciousness. During loss of consciousness, seizure patients were unresponsive, had convulsive movements, urinated, injured their tongue, and were cyanotic. These patients experienced postictal confusion, muscle pain, and headaches. Patients collapsing because of syncope experienced presyncope (dizziness), diaphoresis (excessive sweating), dyspnea, chest pain and palpitations and feelings of warmth, nausea, or vertigo. Patients with syncope lost consciousness after prolonged sitting or standing, in response to needles, when in hot or cold environments or during exercise. 25 In humans suffering from prolonged syncopal episodes, the period of disorientation typically does not exceed 30 seconds. 8 The 2nd cat in this report appeared to have a period of disorientation after collapse that lasted several minutes. This finding normally would be indicative of a postictal period and hence indicate that a seizure had occurred, but in cats the period of disorientation after syncope can last 10 minutes. 26 Cerebral hypoxia secondary to cardiac arrest in humans has been reported to cause a variety of neurologic deficits including mild cognitive dysfunction, seizures, myoclonus, and persistent vegetative states. 27 The 2nd cat had different neurologic deficits on both routine examinations. This finding could indicate that cerebral dysfunction developed secondary to episodes of cerebral hypoxia. Thus, not only can hypoxia during a cardiac arrest lead to development of seizures 27 but it is also possible that the repeated periods of cerebral hypoxia could predispose cats to epilepsy.",

Terbutaline is transiently effective when used in pregnant women to treat fetuses with complete AV block. 28 This report highlights the difficulties in correctly differentiating complex partial seizures from syncope in cats with high-grade AV block.
