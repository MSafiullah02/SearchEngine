Since the adoption of the \u201cOpening Up and Reform\u201d policy of 1978, three special economic zones, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou, have been established in Guangdong. Shenzhen was the first such zone to be created in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and also the most well-known. It underwent an incredible amount of economic development due to special economic policies (such as tax benefits), its proximity to Hong Kong, a significant amount of foreign direct investment (FDI), and the almost unlimited availability of temporary and cheap labor (Liang 1999). Guangdong was the province with the highest aggregated gross domestic product (GDP) in China, accounting for 10.9% of China\u2019s total GDP in 2017.

From 1997 to 2007, the HIV epidemic in Guangdong province was in a rapid growth phase, which was characterized by an explosion in HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID). Although infection via heterosexual contact continued to occur during this period as well, it was not until 2008, when it regained its position as the most common HIV transmission route in Guangdong. Also in 1998, the first cases of infection via homosexual contact emerged, and thereafter, HIV prevalence began to increase among men who have sex with men (MSM). For the first time, in 2012, the male-male sexual contact route had surpassed the injecting drug use route in terms of transmission event frequency. By the end of 2017, a cumulative 81,641 cases of HIV infection had been reported in Guangdong, among whom 33,993 had progressed to AIDS, and 21,006 had died.",

One possible explanation for the higher prevalence estimates in 2007 and prior may be the differences between samples drawn from detention centers versus communities. In general, low-fee FSW in China face a higher risk of incarceration due to their relatively greater exposure\u2014they are not conducting business from inside a venue and do not have the protection of a venue owner and other FSW. Furthermore, evidence indicates that low-fee FSW tend to have higher HIV prevalence due in large part to their reduced ability to negotiate condom use because of economic pressures and vulnerability to client violence. The higher HIV prevalence in earlier years when samples were taken from detention centers is therefore not surprising.\n",

For example, in a study using respondent-driven sampling to recruit FSW in the community in Zhaoqing prefecture in 2006, zero of the 320 participants recruited were found to have HIV infection. However, the same study found the prevalence of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia to be high (8.0%, 9.5%, and 3.9%, respectively), indicating a high frequency of risky sexual behavior in the sample (Li et al. 2010). Another study conducted in Jiangmen showed that the HIV prevalence among FSW in high-, middle- and low-fee settings was 0.14%, 0.23%, and 1.53%, respectively (Zhang and Huang 2012). A study conducted among low- and mid-tier FSW found an HIV prevalence of 0.3%, a syphilis prevalence of 5%, and a herpes simplex 2 virus (HSV-2) prevalence of 31% (Fu et al. 2014). In another study conducted in Guangzhou, no HIV infection was found among high- and mid-tier FSW sampled but found a 2.63% HIV prevalence among low-tier FSW participants (Li et al. 2016). This study also reported that street-based FSW tended to have lower levels of education, to be supporting their families, to charge less for their services, and to remain in the commercial sex industry for a longer time, compared to establishment-based FSW. Also, the proportion of low-fee FSW consistently using condoms with clients and with regular, non-commercial partners was lower than for the mid- and high-fee FSW. The prevalence of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia was also higher among street-based FSW (Li et al. 2012). Finally, a cross-sectional study conducted in three cities in Guangdong found an HIV prevalence of 0.6% among FSW (Shen et al. 2016) (see Chaps. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_3 and 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_7 for more information).",

A survey of STI outpatients in Jiangmen found that HIV prevalence increased from 0% to 1.3% over the period from 2003 to 2007 (Tan et al. 2008). A survey of STI outpatients in Dongguan found that HIV prevalence increased from 0.5% to 3% over the period from 2010 to 2016 (Deng and Liu 2018). For the male subpopulation HIV prevalence increased gradually from 0.5% in 2008 to 2% in 2012 in the same area (Zhang et al. 2013). A study conducted in Shantou in eastern Guangdong found that HIV prevalence among STI outpatients had also increased from 0.04% in 2004 to 0.26% in 2011 (Fang et al. 2012). A cross-sectional study conducted in three cities in Guangdong reported HIV prevalence among male STI patients to be 3.3% (Zhao et al. 2016). Finally, in a recent study in two Guangdong cities, prevalence of HIV among FSW STI clinic attendees was found to be over 4% (Zhao et al. 2018) (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-13-8518-6_3 for more information).",
