In many cases, however, the full potential of vaccination cannot be realized because it is difficult or impossible to vaccinate a substantial proportion of the host population. Particularly challenging scenarios for efficient vaccine delivery include human diseases in regions with poorly developed public health infrastructure and diseases of wild animal populations. An important consequence of the challenges associated with vaccinating large proportions of wild animal populations is that we may be missing opportunities to eliminate or reduce reservoir populations of diseases that occasionally spill over into human populations (e.g., Ebola, Rabies; [1\u20135]), or that provide the raw material for full scale host shifts into the human population (e.g., SARS; [6]). This problem is particularly pressing in light of evidence suggesting that the incidence of such host-shifts is increasing due to the greater prevalence of humans in regions with high levels of wildlife diversity [7]. One promising new technology for dealing with the challenges associated with these difficult-to-immunize animal populations is the development of transmissible vaccines.",

One way in which a transmissible vaccine can be developed is through the process of attenuation [8]. Although attenuation can be accomplished in many ways, the goal in all cases is the transformation of the original viral disease into a benign yet transmissible vaccine. This approach has been used to develop transmissible vaccines both unintentionally, as with the oral polio vaccine [8,9], and intentionally, as with myxoma virus in rabbits [10\u201312]. However, there are limitations and risks associated with transmissible vaccines produced through attenuation. For instance, because attenuated vaccines are built from the pathogen itself, the ability of the vaccine to spread between hosts is bounded by the transmissibility of the pathogen. More worrisome is the possibility of reversion to wild type virulence, as has been observed in the oral polio vaccine [9,13,14]. For this reason, and the constraints imposed by the process of attenuation itself, transmissible vaccines developed through attenuation will generally be only weakly transmissible. Despite these limitations, recent theoretical work has demonstrated that weakly transmissible attenuated vaccines could be highly effective tools, particularly against infectious diseases with relatively low transmission rates [15].",

Specifically, rather than weakening the pathogen itself through a process of attenuation, recombinant transmissible vaccines (RTVs), also called transmissible recombinant vectored vaccines [16], are developed by inserting one or more pathogen genes with antigenic activity into the genome of a benign but transmissible vector organism. Infection with the modified vector, now termed the vaccine, exposes the host immune system to pathogen antigens and prompts a pathogen-specific immune response (Fig. 1). This approach has been used to develop a transmissible vaccine against Sin Nombre Virus within deer mice [17], and is now being used to develop a transmissible vaccine against Ebola within mice and nonhuman primate models [18,19].",

For instance, evolutionary reversion in a RTV is likely to produce the benign vector organism rather than the virulent pathogen itself. Also, because the transmission rate of the vaccine is related to the transmission rate of the vector rather than the pathogen, there are fewer limitations on the vaccine transmission rate. However, because a RTV necessarily integrates components of both disease and vector, it may struggle to spread through a host population where substantial cross-immunity to either the disease or vector already exists [20,21]. This reduction in effectiveness is important in cases where the vector organism is already present in the population, or where vaccine-reversion produces free vector. For these reasons, it is currently unclear whether RTVs that generate cross-immunity can serve as effective tools in the battle against infectious disease.",

RTV\u2019s that use CMV as a backbone are seemingly capable of reinfecting hosts that have had previous exposure to the vaccine, and superinfecting hosts with previous exposure to the CMV vector from which the vaccine was built [17,24].

Our goal is to establish bounds on the role of cross-immunity in hindering the effectiveness of a RTV. We begin by evaluating the ability of a RTV to facilitate pathogen control when the vector is absent from the host population. This first scenario also applies to the extreme case for which cross-immunity with the vector is absent. We compare this baseline case to the other extreme case where cross-immunity is perfect and the vector is circulating in the population or likely to be introduced through sporadic reversion. We direct part of our analysis towards current RTV designs which envision a vaccine that, when administered to a small number of \u2018founder\u2019 animals in a population, will spread autonomously and sufficiently to vaccinate the remaining population. We use a mathematical model to address the following specific questions: (1) can a RTV autonomously eradicate and/or protect a population that has previously experienced vector infection? and (2) if autonomous vaccination by a RTV is impossible, can augmenting the vaccine with direct, manual vaccinations make a RTV an effective tool for the control of infectious disease? Our results indicate that supplementation of a RTV through direct vaccination is critical for disease control if reversion to the vector form is likely and vector-vaccine cross-immunity is present. Our results identify key criteria that must be satisfied for a RTV to be an effective tool in infectious disease management, and outline quantities that must be estimated during the process of vaccine development to evaluate these criteria.",

Specifically, if vaccine-infected individuals transmit the vaccine to more than one additional unvaccinated individual (R0,v > 1), and the vaccine\u2019s R0 is larger than the pathogen\u2019s (R0,v > R0,w), then a host population is cleared of an endemic pathogen and/or protected from future infection (SI, Section 2).",

In the extreme case where the vector and vaccine share perfect cross-immunity, model analyses show that the vector will always outcompete the vaccine and drive the vaccine to extinction (SI Section 2). This occurs regardless of the initial number of vaccinated individuals, and is a direct consequence of the cross-immunity between the vector and vaccine, and the vaccine\u2019s reduced rate of transmission relative to the vector (R0,v < R0,c, Fig. 1). The reduction in transmission of the vaccine relative to its vector renders the vaccine unable to repel the spread of its associated vector should reversion occur, while perfect cross-immunity ensures that the vector will drive the vaccine to extinction by imparting vaccine-immunity to a substantial portion of the population. These results suggest that the viability of autonomous vaccination depends critically on the degree of cross-immunity between the vector and vaccine. In light of this result, we next investigate the extent to which vaccine transmission, when coupled with a steady program of direct vaccination, can facilitate pathogen control even when the vaccine and vector share perfect cross-immunity.",

For instance, if infection with the vector does not confer vaccine immunity to hosts, or if the vector is absent from the population altogether, our results show that a RTV can autonomously sweep through a host population and eradicate an endemic infectious pathogen or provide prophylaxis against a future epidemic. Alternatively, if the vector organism is already circulating within the host population and vector infection imparts perfect vaccine cross-immunity, the benefits of a RTV are more modest, and require that autonomous vaccination be supplemented with continuous direct vaccination. The level of direct vaccination that is required, and the benefits that a RTV provides relative to a non-transmissible vaccine, depend critically on levels of cross-immunity between vector and vaccine, the likelihood of evolutionary reversion to free vector, and the relative transmission rates of vector, vaccine, and pathogen.

Available evidence suggests that reinfection and superinfection by CMV is possible, such that cross-immunity between vector and vaccine may be weak or absent [17,24]. In addition, at least within the lab, it is possible to engineer a genetically modified herpesvirus similar to CMV that does not revert, suggesting it may be evolutionarily stable, at least over relatively short time periods [26]. Finally, at least under some circumstances, CMV is highly transmissible [27], suggesting that it could be a useful vector against even infectious pathogens with relatively high R0. In short, the biology of the RTV\u2019s currently being developed provides reason for optimism, but without accurate estimates for the strength of cross-immunity, and rates of reversion and transmission, their likely efficacy remains uncertain.",

However, the predictions of such multi-strain models are highly sensitive to assumptions made regarding the presence of strain competition within a co-infected host, the rate of strain re-infection, as well as the level of cross-immunity between strains [28]. Once estimates of these specific parameters are found, our theory allows the potential advantage provided by vaccine transmission to be quantified.

We use the subsystem consisting of equations 5a, 5c, 5d, 5h, 5k to describe cases in which the vector does not impart vaccine immunity to hosts, and the full model to describe cases in which vector/vaccine cross-immunity is perfect. By exploring these two extreme descriptions of cross-immunity, our model captures the limits of a broad range of RTVs.",
