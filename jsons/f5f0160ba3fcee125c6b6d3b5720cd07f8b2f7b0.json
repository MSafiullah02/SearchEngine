In the first stage, the stronger quarantine measures at the border were implemented. Once patients who had no connection to Wuhan appeared inside the border, The government started to track these patients as far as possible and tried to find people contacted to these patients. Once these \"track and quarantine clusters\" tactics were overwhelmed by the number of patients, the government started to ask behavior changes to people, culminating \"declaration of the emergency\" on April 6. Public facilities like libraries were closed. Large shopping malls and entertainment businesses, such as movie theatres, were asked to be closed. Restaurants are asked to shorten their operating hours and stop providing alcoholic beverages at night. Working from home was encouraged, and the citizens were advised to avoid crowded areas and generally avoid going outside unnecessarily. However, the Japanese legal system does not have enough mechanisms to enforce these policies. Thus the effectiveness of these policies can be questioned. Many people are still commuting to their office because many companies lack the necessary ability to allow their employees to work from home. Many small restaurants and cafes are still running their business because of the lack of financial compensation.",

Further, fitting the SIRD model in the early stage of infection is difficult, as pointed out in stat-exchange 1 . Using a Bayesian method, we avoid these problems to some degree, because a Bayesian method estimates parameter distribution instead of a point estimate. Thus, we can assess the degree of confidence of each parameter. Further, by well-established statistical methods, we can compare the explanatory power of different models.",

Therefore, our method cannot estimate the absolute level of the detection rate. However, the estimate of \u03b2 is still accurate so our method can be used to estimate \u03b2. In fact, Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 shows that our model is robust against changing q. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the estimated \u03b2 and q for synthesized data using constant \u03b2 = 0.07 but changing q which goes 1 to 0.8 in Apr. 1. Fig 3 shows \u03b2 estimated by const-q model drops at April 1. Although the estimate by our model also drops around the same date, the drop is less significant. This indicates that allowing q vary makes an estimated \u03b2 robust against a sudden change of q. Fig. 5 and Fig 6 show the estimated \u03b2 and q for synthesized data using linearly decreasing \u03b2 and noisy q. Fig. 5 shows that our method is smooth while the estimate of const-q is noisy. Again, this shows that our model is more robust against changing q. 1, the short-term change coincides the ground truth. Therefore, the estimated q is still useful to find a short-term shock to the detection rate. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the estimate of \u03b2 and q for data generated with constant \u03b2 and q. Unlike Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 , \u03b2 and time horizon are chosen so that most of population are infected in the end. The result shows that the estimate of \u03b2 becomes unreliable when the infection starts saturated. Therefore, our model is only useful for the case of a low infection rate. The estimated \u03b2 by const-q swings widely, therefore is omitted. In summary, the estimate of \u03b2, which is a key parameter for estimate R, by our model is robust against sudden changes and noise in q, even though the estimate of q itself is unreliable. When the infection begins to saturate among population, the estimate of \u03b2 as well as q becomes unreliable.",

However, we need to be careful because the difference between const-q is not large. Further, there is a data point in which the Pareto-k for the importance weight distribution is larger than 0.7.
