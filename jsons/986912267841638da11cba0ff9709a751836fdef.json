            "text": "Myxomatous valve degeneration (MVD) is the leading cause of cardiac-related death in small breed dogs, but the pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-B1) induces myofibroblastic activation in mitral valve interstitial cells (MVIC) . TGF-B1 is also regulated by mechanical strain, which is prevalent in the valve leaflet. The interactions between mechanical strain and TGF-B1 in canine MVD is unknown. We hypothesized that TGF-B1 induces a myxomatous phenotype in MVIC that is potentiated by cyclic mechanical strain. To test this, we developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) in vitro culture assay.",

            "text": "Collectively, these results suggest that MVIC differentiate towards myxomatous phenotypes via TGF-B1 in vitro regardless of MVD state. Increased collagen compaction from diseased MVIC may be due to elevated endogenous TGF-B1 signaling. Cyclic equibiaxial strain applied here protected against a myxomatous phenotype, but alternate strain profiles such as may be observed in hearts with MVD may differently regulate the MVIC phenotype, both in concert and independent of TGF-B1 signaling. Studies are underway to assess different strain patterns, rates, and signaling molecules on MVIC phenotype in canine MVD. Atrial pacing of dogs with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and adequate atrioventricular (AV) node conduction permits physiological depolarization and contraction of the ventricles; thereby decreasing the possibility of pacemaker syndrome. This complication is more likely in dogs with AV valve regurgitation, which is common in the small breeds affected with SSS. This retrospective study examined atrial pacing (AAI) in dogs with SSS with the hypothesis that it is feasible and not different in complication frequency to ventricular pacing.",

Follow up time ranged from 45-1,227 days (mean 436 \u00b1 344). One dog developed complete AV block 27 days postoperatively requiring ventricular pacing. The remainder of the dogs had occasional 2nd degree AV block detected on either ECG or Holter evaluation, either immediately post-operatively or only during times of sleep and rest on recheck evaluations. Lead dislodgment occurred in 3/16 dogs 1, 19 and 27 days post-operatively. All lead dislodgements occurred with actively fixed, bipolar leads. Lead perforation into the pericardial space occurred in 2/16 dogs 79 and 120 days post-operatively, both with passively fixed, bipolar leads. Lead migration occurred in 3/16 dogs 57, 192, and 1,016 days after implantation. None of these dogs had complete loss of capture but all required higher thresholds for pacing. Two of these dogs likely had microdislodgement of the lead tip and 1 dog had a stable lead tip with a loop of lead located in the right ventricle on follow up. Two of these were active fixation leads and 1 was a passive fixation lead. All 3 were bipolar leads. Oversensing, consisting of refractory sensed events and noise reversion pacing was seen in 5/5 unipolar leads and 4/ 11 bipolar leads.",

Lead perforation, dislodgement and migration appear to be risks, which are greater when compared to early published experiences with ventricular pacing in veterinary cardiology and atrial pacing in people. Leads with reduced torque at the lead tip, higher flexibility during atrial contraction and increased lead-tip surface of contact with the endocardium may reduce these complications. Because of the potential long-term benefits of AAI pacing in dogs with SSS, veterinary cardiologists should continue to optimize AAI pacing and compare this method to ventricular pacing for dogs with SSS. Cardiac pacemaking is the result of the electrical activity of pacemaker cells, determined by the interplay of several ionic currents, pumps, and exchangers. Of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, the funny current (If) plays an important role. The molecular correlates of native funny channels are the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, of which four isoforms are known (HCN1 to 4). Of these isoforms, HCN4 is the most abundant and predominantly expressed in the sinoatrial node. It has been previously shown in humans and rodents that the density of HCN channels in the heart does change during cardiac development and may be altered with myocardial disease and in response to hormonal stimuli.",

Statistical analyses were performed to determine significant differences in procedure time and outcome for dogs divided into groups based on pacing mode (single vs. dual chamber) and lead number (one, two, or three).

This study supports previous studies which challenge the validity of avoiding dual chamber pacemakers due to an increased complication rate. Loop diuretics are a crucial therapeutic component in the management of left-sided congestive heart failure (L-CHF), yet published data about their safety and efficacy in acute L-CHF in veterinary patients are sparse. We sought to investigate whether an addition of constant rate infusion (CRI) to intermittent bolus (IB) administration of intravenous (IV) furosemide has an added benefit to short-term outcome in client-owned pets with acute L-CHF. A retrospective analytic cross-sectional study investigated pets hospitalized between 2003 and 2010. Patients were divided between an IB and an IB+CRI group. Recorded data included serum biochemistry parameters, hospitalization length, mortality, L-CHF recurrence and respiration-related parameters. The IB group consisted of 43 dogs and 16 cats, while the CRI group included 33 dogs and 8 cats. The median cumulative furosemide dose of the CRI group was 0.99 mg/kg/h (range 0.02-3.73, n=39), significantly lower than that of the IB group at 1.19 mg/ kg/h (range 0.17-7.14, n=51) (P=0.008). Both treatment groups induced a statistically significantly lower respiratory rate relative to baseline values (from 111.3\u00b144.8 and 104.7\u00b143.6 to 34.9\u00b119.82 and 30.87\u00b112.87 for IB and CRI, respectively; p<0.0001 within each group). The maximal respiratory rates in CRI-dogs were lower compared to IB-dogs (p=0.054). The minimal respiratory rate were lower in CRI-cats compared to IB-cats (p=0.016). However, no statistically significant difference in respiratory rate parameters was recorded between the two groups, when compared on an hourly basis. Both CRI and IB methods induced minor hypokalemia with no significant difference between groups (p=0.564). While serum creatinine increased following both administration methods there was only a borderline significant difference between the two groups in dogs. Serum creatinine following treatment was 1.22\u00b10.4 and 1.5\u00b10.7 mg/dl in the IB and CRI groups, respectively (p=0.074). The median length of hospitalization was 2.00 days, and did not differ significantly between dogs and cats or between treatment groups. There was no significant difference in mortality rates between the CRI (14.6%) and the IB (15.3%) groups (p=0.93). A significantly higher mortality rate was found for cats (29%) relative to dogs (10.5%, p=0.045). Study results could not support the hypothesis that adding CRI to routine IB improves the shortterm outcome for pets with L-CHF. Nevertheless, the fact that both treatments reached a similar outcome despite a significantly lower cumulative dose in the CRI group is encouraging. A larger scale, prospective, double-blind random study should be designed with similar cumulative doses in both treatment groups. The aim of the study was to assess left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF) in dogs with and without myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) and to correlate LAEF with clinical variables. All dogs underwent clinical examination and 2-dimensional (2D) and real-time 3-dimensional (RT3D) echocardiography. The latter was used to assess left atrial (LA) volumes at atrial end-diastole (LAd) and end-systole (LAs), and the resulting LAEF. A total of 153 dogs, of which 101 dogs had MMVD and 52 were healthy control dogs, were included into the study. Included dogs were of 58 different breeds. Eighty-six dogs (56%) were males. According to the CHIEF classification of congestive heart failure (CHF); 73 dogs were classified without CHF (68 in class BI and 5 in BII) and 28 dogs with CHF (22 in CII and 6 in CIII). Age ranged from 2 months to 18 years in all dogs, with a median of 10 years for MMVD dogs and 4 years for control dogs (P<0.0001). Body weight ranged from 3 to 55 kg in all dogs, with a median of 11 kg for MMVD dogs and 17 kg for control dogs (P=0.009).

We predict a heightened benefit of 3DE in presence of left ventricular distortion. Further studies are warranted in canine heart disease to confirm this hypothesis. Adiponectin is an abundant endocrine hormone secreted from adipocytes and paradoxically, inversely correlated to adiposity. By increasing angiogenesis and vasodilation, and by decreasing the cardiac remodeling processes such as hypertrophy, apoptosis, fibrosis and inflammation, adiponectin elicits protective effects in the vasculature and myocardium. In humans, hypoadiponectinemia is associated with coronary artery disease, while hyperadiponectinemia predicts morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. This paradoxical relationship could be explained by the fact that in overt congestive heart failure, wasting is associated with an increased risk of death.",

Forty nine adult (range 1-13 years), 19 growing (range 1-11 months) healthy dogs, and 36 dogs in heart failure, classified either according to the etiology or to the ISACHC class (mitral valve disease n=16, dilated cardiomyopathy n=11, other causes n=9; IS-ACHC1 n = 15, ISACHC2 n = 9, ISACHC3 n = 12) were included. Adiponectin was measured by a canine specific sandwich ELISA kit. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were respectively 4.4% and 4.1%. Mean adiponectin level in healthy adults was 11.1\u00b11.2 mg/L. Adiponectin plasma concentration decreased linearly with age (-0.6 mg/L per year, r=0.37, p=0.011). No significant effect of body weight, gender, body score or circadian rhythm was observed. Adiponectin levels were increased in dilated cardiomyopathy (20\u00b14 mg/L p<0.01) and tended to decrease in mitral valve disease (6.6\u00b11.4 mg/L, p=0.06) compared to healthy adults. Adiponectin was higher in overt heart failure (ISACHC3 17.3\u00b14.1 mg/L p<0.05) compared to ISACHC1 and 2 together (10.6\u00b11.8 mg/L). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that, in dogs, adiponectin is age dependent. Moreover, in heart failure dogs, adiponectin levels are disease and stage dependent. Pathophysiological, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic implications of these observations should be investigated. Pulmonary transit time (PTT) is a parameter of cardiac performance which has been previously established in dogs and humans. This index is usually normalized to the heart rate (nPTT) according the formula nPTT=PTT/mRR, where mRR is the mean RR interval duration. Previous studies in dogs showed that PTT can be measured either by first pass radionuclide technique or echocardiographically by use of the contrast agent SonoVue\u00ae.",

Measurements of cardiac chambers and walls are often normalized for bodyweight by comparing them to aortic valve measurements, allowing clinicians to develop weight-independent estimates of chamber enlargement. Two-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of the left atrium (LA) and aorta (AO) have been proposed as more accurately reflecting LA size than M-mode measurements. Reference intervals for LA:AO in healthy dogs have been proposed independently by 2 groups of investigators, however, these two groups used slightly different methods to measure the AO and obtained different reference intervals of LA:AO in healthy dogs. To determine if these reference intervals differed because of the different methods used to measure the AO, we compared these 2D methods of measuring the AO.",

The aim of the study was to assess left ventricular (LV) global and regional longitudinal (L), circumferential (C) and radial (R) peak systolic strain (St) and strain rate (Sr) STE variables, including their feasibility, and variability, and LV synchronicity in healthy Labrador retriever dogs. Nineteen clinically healthy Labradors: 15 females and 4 males with (mean \u00b1 SD) age 6.6 \u00b1 3.7 years, bodyweight 28.6 \u00b1 4.2 kg, and heart rate 107 \u00b1 15 beats per minute were included. Cineloops were acquired from left apical 4 chamber view and right parasternal short axis view at basal and apical levels with a 5-2 MHz probe for MyLab30TM Gold system (Esaote, Florence) and analyzed with regards to St and Sr using the XStrainTM software. In addition, synchronicity time index (STI) and strain-derived dyssynchrony index (SDI) were assessed. For all variables, a mean of 3 beats was used for the statistical analysis. 86% of the 912 segments was analyzed: 14% were excluded, all longitudinal, due to echo-drop out or artifacts. A general epicardial to endocardial St gradient was found (all P<0,01). The CSt variables were significantly higher at apex compared to base (P<0,05). Radial and C regional homogeneity was found, except for CSt epicardial segments at base and apex. A LSt base to apex gradient was found. Apical RSt and RSr were positively correlated with heart rate. Including dogs in which all the segments were obtainable (n=12), the coefficient of variation was lower for the LSt and LSr variables compared to corresponding C variables. Synchronicity results for STI and SDI were 35.72 \u00b1 21.64 ms and 16.17\u00b110.5 ms, respectively. This study shows that STE assessment of global and regional systolic St and Sr was possible in all dogs for C and R variables, and in a majority of L variables. Longitudinal variables had lower feasibility, but also lower variability. These and other results of this study could be of value for future STE studies. Newer echocardiographic methods such as speckle tracking (2DStrain) provide quantitative assessment of regional systolic and diastolic myocardial deformation. In myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), conventional echocardiographic indices of myocardial function are preserved until late stages. However, dogs often develop congestive heart failure (CHF) and experimental studies have indicated contractile dysfunction. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the segmental peak radial (R) and longitudinal (L) strain (S), strain rate in systole (SRs), in early (SRe) and late (SRa) diastole in dogs with different severities of MMVD using 2DStrain. The study included 102 dogs: 20 Beagles with no/minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 61 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with increasing severity of MR, 14 CKCS (CHF-CKCS) and 7 dogs of different breeds (CHF-MIX) with clinical signs of CHF due to MMVD. Using a Vivid-i ultrasound system, all dogs underwent echocardiography including 2D grayscale images for offline analysis of 2DStrain by use of commercially available software (EchoPAC). By use of Mann-Whitney U test, Beagles and CKCS with no/minimal MR were compared, as were CKCS-CHF compared to CHF-MIX, without finding differences in 2DStrain variables between groups. Including all dogs, Spearman\u00b4s rank correlations with a Bonferroni corrected P-value (P<0.008) were computed between 2DStrain variables and age, heart rate (HR), left atrial-to-aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) and MR. Radial S increased with MR in 5/6 myocardial segments (P<0.002) and with LA/Ao in 4/6 segments (P<0.003). Radial SRs significantly increased with MR in 5/6 segments (P<0.006), however significant increase with HR was also found for these segments (P<0.002). Radial SRe increased with LA/Ao in 6/6 segments (P<0.002) and with MR in 4/6 segments (P<0.001). In one segment, RSRe also increased with HR (P=0.007). Likewise, LS significantly increased with LA/Ao in 3/6 segments, with MR in 2/6 segments (all P<0.0003) and with age in one segment (P=0.006). Longitudinal SRs increased with HR in all segments (P<0.0003) and LA/Ao and MR in one segment (P<0.003). Longitudinal SRe and LSRa increased with MR and LA/Ao in 2/6 myocardial segments (all P<0.0008) but also with HR and age (P<0.003) in one of these segments. In conclusion, 35/48 2DStrain variables increased with indices of MMVD.",

Vitamin D plays a pivotal role in cardiac function and there is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency contributes to the etiology and pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF) in people. We examined the association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the hallmark of vitamin D status, and CHF in dogs. A further objective was to determine the impact of 25(OH)D status on clinical outcome in dogs with CHF. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were examined in 82 client-owned dogs, including 31 with CHF and 51 unaffected controls. The relationship between CHF-cases and controls and 25(OH)D level, age, and body condition score were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Potential differences in vitamin D oral intake, calculated on the basis of a dietary questionnaire, were also evaluated between groups. The effect of 25(OH)D level on time to another cardiovascular event was evaluated by use of Cox Regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. Values of P 0.05 were considered significant. Mean 25(OH)D concentration (100 \u00b1 44 nmol/L) in dogs with CHF was significantly lower than that of unaffected dogs (123 \u00b1 42 nmol/L). The mean calculated vitamin D intake (nutrition) per kg body weight in dogs with CHF was actually significantly higher than that of unaffected dogs (0.67 \u00b1 0.49 \u03bcg/kg body weight versus 0.42 \u00b1 0.27 \u03bcg/kg body weight, respectively). There was a significant effect of 25(OH)D level on time to another episode of CHF. These findings suggest low levels of 25(OH)D might be a risk factor for CHF in dogs.

Lack of a correlation between serum calgranulin concentrations and clinical disease activity agrees with the results for other serum markers, and the lack of a correlation with the concentration of CRP in serum could possibly be explained by spatial and/ or temporal differences in their expression and/or release into the extracellular space. Further studies are under way to evaluate mucosal and fecal concentrations of calprotectin and S100A12 in canine patients with IBD. Calprotectin (CP) is a heterodimeric protein complex of neutrophils and macrophages. To screen patients prior to more invasive procedures, several noninvasive markers of gastro-intestinal inflammation have been suggested in humans with inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The concentration of fecal CP in feces has been shown to be a useful marker for inflammatory bowel disease in humans with higher concentrations in affected humans than in healthy controls. A radioimmunoassay for the quantification of canine calprotectin (cCP) in fecal samples has recently been developed and analytically validated [1].

            "text": "In the present study, the majority of dogs with pancreatitis (>70%) had normal serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, while some dogs had mild increases in those parameters. The majority of dogs with pancreatitis had distinctly different lipoprotein profiles from healthy dogs, even in cases in which serum concentrations of triglyceride and cholesterol were normal. Further studies are needed to determine the pathophysiology and clinical importance of those changes in lipoprotein profiles. Tylosin has been shown to be effective in treating diarrheal disorders in dogs and thus the term tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD) has been established. In dogs with TRD, the stool remains normal as long as treatment continues, but diarrhea reappears in many dogs within weeks after discontinuation. Tylosin has been reported to increase the proportions of Enterococcus-like organisms in the canine jejunal microbiota of healthy dogs. It was then speculated, that this could be one possible factor contributing to tylosin\u00b4s positive effect in ceasing diarrhea in dogs, as some enterococci strains are known to have probiotic characters. The aim of this clinical study was to assess the effects of tylosin administration on the levels of Enterococcus spp. and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as well as levels of tylosin resistant Enterococcus spp. and LAB in the feces of dogs with TRD. Eleven client-owned dogs with TRD were enrolled in this prospective clinical trial. At the beginning (time point A) all the dogs were on tylosin treatment and had normal fecal consistency. After the tylosin treatment was discontinued a follow-up period of a maximum of two months commenced to determine the reappearence of diarrhea. After onset of diarrhea (time point B), all dogs received tylosin orally 25 mg/kg q 24h for seven days. On day seven (time point C) the stool was ferm again in all dogs. Fecal samples were collected on all three time points. Feces were serially diluted ten-fold in peptone water and plated for enumeration. LAB and enterococci were enumerated on MRS and Slanez-Bartley media, respectively. Tylosin-resistant LAB and enterococci were enumerated on corresponding media supplemented with 100 lg/ml tylosin. The results showed that the total counts of Enterococcus spp. and LAB decreased after tylosin discontinuation while the dogs had diarrhea and increased during tylosin administration when the dogs had normal fecal consistency. The changes in the total counts of Enterococcus spp. were significant (p<0.05). Almost all LAB and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to tylosin when the dogs were on tylosin treatment (timepoint A and C), but resistance against tylosin decreased significantly when the treatment was discontinued. Our findings indicate that tylosin administration results in a significant increase in the levels of Enterococcus spp. in the feces of dogs suffering from TRD. These bacteria could have probiotic properties and thus attenuate inflammation on the gut mucosa and normalize the fecal consistency in dogs with diarrhea. Hypercortisolism is a common endocrinological disorder of middle-aged and older dogs. In about 15% of cases the excessive secretion of glucocorticoids is a result of an ACTH-independent benign or malignant adrenocortical tumor (AT). The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway has been reported to be important in adrenocortical growth and steroidogenesis. Moreover, in about 90% of human cortisol-secreting adrenocortical carcinomas overexpression of IGF-II is described. In case of overexpression of IGF, IGF-receptor blockers may be used to treat this disorder. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether altered expression of the GH-IGF pathway plays a role in tumorigenesis of cortisol-secreting ATs in dogs.",

Forty-six % of dogs with pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism (PDH) have proteinuria and 50 to 80 % have hypertension, which do not always resolve after treatment.

The first group consisted of 60 lean diabetic cats (30 male, 30 female), mean age 12.7 years (range 5-18y), mean weight 4.15 Kg (range: 2.59-6Kg). The second group consisted of 60 obese non-diabetic cats (30 male, 30 female), mean age 15.2 years (range: 9.1-20y), mean weight 5.7 Kg (range: 3.4-8.3Kg). Primers had been designed that flanked the mutation to allow PCR amplification of this region of MC4R from genomic DNA obtained from EDTA blood. The PCR products were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. BstOI digestion products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi squared test. Bonferroni correction was applied when doing multiple group comparisons. Of the 60 lean diabetic cats, 20 (33%) were homozygous for the mutation (CC), compared to 15 (25%) of 60 obese control cats. This compares with 21 of 60 homozygous mutants in the lean non-diabetic population and 33 of 60 homozygous mutants in the obese diabetic population seen previously. The difference between lean diabetic cats and lean non-diabetic cats was not statistically significant, whereas the difference between the group of obese diabetics and obese non-diabetic was statistically significant (p<0.05). This study further confirms that a missense mutation identified in the coding sequence of MC4R in DSH cats is associated with DM in obese DSH cats. Conversely to the information available in human studies, this mutation does not seem to be primarily associated with obesity and secondary type 2 diabetes. In contrast, these results suggest that the mutation might be involved in progression to overt DM in obese cats. Pancreatitis is observed in up to 50% of cats with diabetes mellitus at necropsy. Whether pancreatitis develops before diabetes, and may be causally involved, or during the disease is unknown. Currently, diagnosis of pancreatitis in vivo in cats relies on a combination of clinical signs, measurement of pancreatic enzymes activity, such as feline pancreatic lipase and trypsinlike immunoreactivity (fPLI and fTLI, respectively), and abdominal ultrasonography. The aim of the study was to use these parameters to investigate the occurrence of pancreatitis in diabetic cats on admission and during follow-up.",

            "text": "We conclude that hyperkalemia, concurrent diseases, and ketoacidosis at diagnosis or during follow-up predict a poorer outcome in diabetic cats. The causal link between decreased life expectancy and hyperkalemia remains unknown, in particular considering its mild degree. Concurrent diseases may complicate diabetes management or decrease owners' willingness to treat. Of note, ketoacidosis decreased survival during follow-up but not at diagnosis, suggesting that in the latter this complication should not be regarded as unfavourable. Glucocorticoids are potent regulators of fibrinogen and haptoglobin biosynthesis in both humans and dogs and increase their secretion. Both proteins are synthesised by the liver and increase in humans and dogs with naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism or following glucocorticoid administration. In addition, fibrinogen and haptoglobin are positive moderate acute phase proteins and their plasma/serum levels increase in inflammatory conditions due to increased hepatic synthesis stimulated by cytokines. There have been no studies into the effect on inflammation-mediated fibrinogen and haptoglobin synthesis in the absence of endogenous glucocorticoid. Naturally occurring Addison's disease in dogs is generally an immune-mediated disease causing impaired glucocorticoid production. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess whether dogs with Addison's disease have appropriate fibrinogen and haptoglobin concentrations for their level of inflammation [assessed by their serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration]. To evaluate this hypothesis, only dogs with newly diagnosed, naturally-occurring Addison's disease (diagnosed by an ACTH stimulation test), that had not received any treatment were included. Only dogs with FDPs and D-dimers within the reference range were included, to exclude fibrinolysis and fibrinogenolysis as the cause of reduced fibrinogen concentrations. Serum samples with macroscopic haemolysis were also excluded as haemolysis may decrease haptoglobin concentrations. Two sick control animals with normal FDPs and D-dimers were included for each Addisonian dog included. The control dogs were matched for age, sex, and breed (or size if the breed was not found) and had serum CRP concentrations within \u00b1 0.5 mg/ dl of those of the Addisonian dog. As CRP concentrations could not be matched exactly, the fibrinogen/CRP and haptoglobin/ CRP ratios were calculated to minimize the effects of inequalities in the degree of inflammation between each Addisonian dog and the two control dogs. Normality of data was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. CRP, haptoglobin and fibrinogen concentrations were compared among the two groups using Student's ttests and the ratios were compared using Mann-Whitney tests. Nineteen Addisonian dogs and 38 control dogs were included. All Addisonian dogs had CRP concentrations above the reference range. No difference in CRP concentration was found among the two groups (P=0.722) but the fibrinogen and haptoglobin concentrations and the fibrinogen/CRP and haptoglobin/ CRP ratios were significantly lower in the Addisonian dogs than the control population (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.01 and P=0.002, respectively). These results suggest that fibrinogen and haptoglobin plasma/serum concentration is suboptimal when an inflammatory process occurs in dogs with no endogenous glucocorticoids. The treatment of choice for adrenal dependent hyperadrenocorticism (ADH) is adrenalectomy. When surgery is not possible, medical treatment with mitotane is the recommended alternative. Some studies have indicated that trilostane is a good option for canine ADH. The aim of this study was to compare the longterm survival of dogs diagnosed with ADH treated with mitotane versus trilostane.",

Diagnosis of ADH was based on clinical and laboratorial data and abdominal ultrasonography, and confirmed by adrenocortical function tests. All dogs had a maximal dorso-ventral thickness of the tumour contra-lateral gland 5 mm. Mitotane (NSAP) was administered at 75-100 mg/kg/day for 25 days, and after the third day, hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone was provided lifelong. The animals on SAP protocol received 50-75 mg/kg/day of mitotane during the induction period; after successful induction, a maintenance dose of mitotane (75-100 mg/kg/week) was given.

One non-invasive quantitative medical device (Fibroscan\u00ae, Paris, France), based on ultrasound transient elastography (TE) technique, has emerged into clinical practice for diagnosing hepatic fibrosis in humans by means of liver stiffness as a marker for disease state. Motivated by the usefulness of this technique, the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using the Fibroscan\u00ae device in dogs, certain pedigree are prone to chronic liver hepatitis and clinical tests are rarely evident until an advanced stage. 44 dogs (Scottish Terrier, Labrador, etc) were enrolled in the study after the owner consent.

However, TE may provide veterinary doctors with new important options for improving dog care regarding liver chronic diseases in terms of diagnosis and monitoring fibrosis progression. It could be of great interest and needs to be adapted to dog morphology and evaluated further. Introduction : The best studied example of copper toxicosis in dogs is the Bedlington terrier. In this dog breed, a mutation in the COMMD1 gene causes severe liver copper accumulation.1 In several other breeds, among which the Labrador, familial copper associated hepatitis has been recognized.2 In the Labrador, pedigree analyses show a complex, rather than a monogenetic background. Labradors affected with hepatitis tend to have lower liver copper levels than affected Bedlington terriers. Conventional treatment in Bedlington terriers consists of lifelong chelation therapy with penicillamine, whereas in affected Labradors, lifelong treatment may be unnecessary.",

Body temperature decreased in both groups; commencement of eating was not linked to the reduction in body temperature but treated cats with an initial hyperthermia appeared to respond more frequently.",

The degree of impairment correlated weakly with fat mass, but oxygenation improved after weight loss. Supplemental oxygen administration is recommended when obese dogs are sedated for clinical procedures. It has been hypothesized that diets promoting fecal volume and moisture may decrease diuresis by diverting part of ingested water into feces. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of increasing fecal moisture by the addition of soluble fiber on urine and fecal water excretion. Healthy adult colony cats were sequentially fed 2 identical dry expanded diets except for the sources of dietary fiber. The levels of total dietary fiber (TDF) were similar between the 2 diets (7.3% on a dry matter basis), but the main sources of fibers included cellulose, fructoligosaccharides and chicorei pulp for diet A (high in soluble fiber) and cellulose for diet B (high in insoluble fiber). Each diet was fed for a period of 14 days; 9 days of adaptation followed by 5 days of collection, during which cats were individually housed with daily recording of food and water intakes and collection of all feces and urine. Food amounts were adjusted to maintain the cats' weights. Water was offered as libitum. Water content of the feces was determined by weight difference after desiccation in a drying oven. Water content of the urine was derived from the total urine weight. Data are presented as median [range] . Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare the amount of water intake and water production in urine and feces between the two diets. Overall, including diet moisture, water intake and excretion were greater for diet A than diet B (P<0.05). This study shows that in cats, the addition of soluble fibers to a dry expanded diet results in higher water content in the feces; but also in the urine contrary to the initial hypothesis. Cats appear to be able to adjust their water intake to compensate for increased fecal water losses. The prevalence of overweight or obesity in cats is between 12.5% and 52% in Western countries. Overweight is associated with many health problems and dietary energy restriction remains its treatment of choice. Weight rebound after weight loss is a well-known phenomenon in humans and companions animals. Little is known about the post-weight loss maintenance energy requirement in cats, however. The aims of this study were to induce weight loss in obese colony cats and to estimate their post weight loss maintenance energy requirement to avoid weight rebound.",

CT diagnosis of laryngeal collapse and laryngeal paralysis required three-dimensional internal rendering. CT findings indicative of laryngeal paralysis included failure to abduct the arytenoid cartilages, narrowed rima glottis and air filled laryngeal ventricles. Laryngeal collapse findings depended on the grade of collapse and included everted laryngeal saccules, collapse of the cuneiform processes and corniculate processes, and narrowed rima glottis. Trachea abnormalities included hypoplasia, stenosis or collapse syndrome. The CT findings in tracheal hypoplasia consisted of a severely narrowed lumen throughout the entire length. Tracheal stenosis was represented by a circumferential decrease in tracheal lumen size limited to one region. Tracheal collapse syndrome was diagnosed by severe asymmetric narrowing. Lobar bronchi collapse appeared in CT images as a narrowed asymmetric lumen diameter. CT imaging of unanesthetized dogs with upper airway obstruction compares favorably with traditional non-imaging diagnostic methods. Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial fibrotic pulmonary disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis, mainly described in middle-aged to old West Highland white terriers (WHWT). In human IPF, pathways involving transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), a cytokine with profibrotic properties, seem to be central in the pathogenesis and are considered as potential therapeutic targets. In veterinary medicine, serum TGFB1 concentration is elevated in both healthy WHWT and WHWT with IPF, as compared to healthy dogs of various breeds. This suggests the occurrence of a breed specificity that might be linked to the breed predisposition observed in WHWT for IPF. The aim of the present study was to determine serum TGFB1 concentration in middle-aged to old healthy dogs from terrier breeds other than WHWT and from non-terrier breeds, and to compare these results with those obtained in healthy WHWT.",

Hence, warning notices concerning the use of NAC in veterinary literature are numerous, although only few specific studies for small animals have been conducted so far. Moreover, the role of histamine in feline bronchoconstriction is discussed controversially.",

Airway reactivity was assessed by monitoring increases in enhanced pause (PENH), a unitless variable that measures bronchoconstriction as derived from dose-response curves, and by visual evaluation of these curves. Data of cats with respiratory disease were compared to data of healthy cats via student's t-test. A student's t-test for paired samples was used to compare basal PENH to PENH post NAC nebulisation among all cats. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.",

In cats with respiratory disease, basal PENH was 0.47\u00b1 0.22 and did not differ significantly from healthy cats (p=0.67) or to values post NAC nebulisation (p=0.15; PENH: 0.67\u00b10.22). However, values of post-NAC-application-PENH differed significantly (p=0.012) between healthy cats and cats with respiratory disease.Furthermore, 1 cat with feline asthma showed signs of bronchoconstriction when nebulised with NAC. We conclude that short-term nebulisation of therapeutic doses of NAC does not cause airflow limitation in healthy cats, but should be used with caution in cats with respiratory disease. The pathogenesis of chronic feline bronchial disease (FBD) remains unclear. Persistent infections with Mycoplasma spp. are considered to be a contributing factor to chronic airway diseases in humans. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Mycoplasma spp. in the upper and lower respiratory tract of cats suffering from chronic bronchial disease compared to cats without respiratory disease. Seventeen cats with clinical signs of FBD and 14 cats without respiratory disease were included in the study. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and nasal lavage were performed under sterile conditions on all cats. Cytological and routine bacteriological analysis was done on all samples. Furthermore, all samples were cultured for growth of Mycoplasma spp. and DNA was extracted from the lavage fluids and analyzed by PCR to detect feline-specific mycoplasmas. Statistical analysis was done using Fisher's exact test. Mycoplasma spp. could only be cultivated from two BAL samples from FBD cats and from two BAL and two nasal lavage samples from cats without respiratory disease. Six cats out of 17 with FBD and seven out of 14 cats without respiratory disease were positive for mycoplasmas by PCR in BAL. In nasal lavage samples, mycoplasmas could not be detected by PCR in cats with FBD, but in five cats without respiratory disease, which were also all positive in the BAL fluid. Sequencing of PCR products confirmed the detected species to be Mycoplasma felis in all PCR-positive samples. The prevalence of mycoplasmas was not significantly different between the two groups. Limitations of the study are the small group size and that the group without respiratory disease consisted of cats that were euthanized due to other diseases. Mycoplasma felis can be detected in cats with and without respiratory signs in the upper and lower airways and does not appear to be linked to FBD. Domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, has recently been included in the list of available anti-Leishmania drugs in the current consensus guidelines for treatment of canine Leishmaniosis1. Its mechanism of action is based on the activation of the cell-mediated immune response. The Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test (NBT) has been proposed as a valuable tool for the monitoring of cellular immunity in canine leishmaniosis2. The aims of this study were to evaluate the shortterm efficacy of Domperidone in mild and moderate canine leishmaniosis by clinical and immunological follow-up, and to assess the eventual effects of treatment on the phagocytic function of polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes using the NBT.",

Dogs with severe immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) are at risk of spontaneous hemorrhage when the platelet count drops below 30,000/\u03bcL. While corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for ITP, adjunctive treatment may decrease the duration of thrombocytopenia. In separate prospective studies, adjunctive treatment with both vincristine and human intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIg) has been shown to decrease platelet recovery time compared to corticosteroid treatment alone.

Despite recent studies investigating new therapy modalities, corticosteroids are still the mainstay therapy in feline chronic non infectious bronchial disease (feline asthma and chronic bronchitis). Inhaled glucocorticoids (iGC) allow for maximized local efficacy, while minimizing systemic effects. However, systemic absorption of iGC is not completely eliminated and is possible through the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to evaluate owner adherence to therapeutic recommendations, acceptance by patients, efficacy, side effects and impact on the hypothalamus-pituitary gland-adrenocortical axis (HPAA) of long-term iGC therapy in naturally occurring feline asthma and chronic bronchitis. The study was performed with the approval of the ethics committee of the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna as well as the Federal Ministry of Research and Science (bmwf: GZ 68205/118-II/10b/2010). Owners of 40 cats (34 with feline asthma, 6 with chronic bronchitis) treated with 400\u03bcg of inhalant budesonide twice daily were contacted, and information was retrieved by a questionnaire. Patients still on iGC were reevaluated clinically and underwent barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP) and ACTH-stimulation testing. Data of BWBP, namely baseline enhanced pause (Penh) and the carbachol concentration provoking a 300% increase of baseline Penh (PC-Penh300) before treatment were compared to data under treatment using a paired student\u00b4s T-test. In one half of the cats therapy had been withdrawn because of poor owner compliance (n=6), poor acceptance by patients (n=4), resolution of clinical signs with no relapse after drug discontinuation (n=4), lack of efficacy (n=4) or death due to unrelated reasons (n=2). Therapy duration in the 20 patients still on iGC ranged from 2 to 76 months (median 10 months). In the owners' opinion cats had improved (n=9) or clinical signs had resolved (n=11). Cats on iGC had significantly lower basal Penh (p=0.048) and higher PC-Penh300 (p=0.049) values than before treatment. In none of the cats corticosteroid-induced side effects were observed. HPAA suppression was detected in 3 of 14 patients (stimulated cortisol levels: 226,25 +/-107.2 nmol/l). Treatment with iGC improved clinical signs and BWBP-results in cats with naturally occurring chronic non infectious bronchial disease. Although iGC have the potential to suppress the HPAA, treated cats had no clinical signs or biochemical alterations attributable to systemic corticosteroid effects.

Traditionally in veterinary medicine, pleural effusions (PE) are classified as transudates, modified transudates and exudates based on the total protein (TPp) and total nucleated cell count of the fluid (TNCCp). The large and variable number of disorders associated with modified transudates and the fact that this category has overlapping TPp and TNCCp with transudates and exudates, limit this classification scheme. In human medicine, only two categories are used: transudates and exudates. The biochemical parameters used in human medicine to discriminate transudates from exudates have been shown to be reliable in cats for classifying PE and superior to those traditionally used. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the ability of 9 biochemical parameters, used in human medicine, to distinguish transudates from exudates in dogs.",

The most common ureteral dilemma in feline patients is ureterolith-induced obstruction. Traditional therapy is associated with excessive morbidity/mortality. Our objective is to evaluate the technical and clinical outcomes in feline patients after double-pigtail ureteral stent placement. 66 cats (74 ureters) had stent placement attempted for ureteral stone(s) (72%) or stricture (28%). 94% were successful surgically and 15.7% endoscopically.

The breed predispositions, the older age at evaluation than females and the diagnostic accuracy of diureticenhanced ultrasonography are confirmed. The anatomic features of ectopic ureters are similar to those of females. This condition remains unfrequent in the male; the true prevalence is certainly underestimated because of the longer urethra providing a stronger muscular sphincter caudal to the ectopic orifice, so preventing urinary incontinence. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing urethral sphincter incompetence in male dogs with ureteral ectopia by urodynamic data. This condition hampers a complete post-surgical resolution of incontinence and urethral pressure profiles could be used prognostic indicators. Extracorporeal blood purification techniques such as hemodialysis (HD) require anticoagulation of the circulating blood. The most common protocol uses systemic heparinisation that can however hinder urgent surgical procedures or worsen existing hemostatic disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or leptospirosis-associated pulmonary hemorrhages. Regional anticoagulation techniques have thus been developed in humans for critical patients treated with continuous renal replacement therapy. One technique aims at reducing the ionized calcium concentration in the extracorporeal circuit (< 0.4 mmol/l) by infusing trisodium citrate in the arterial line and restoring calcemia (> 0.8 mmol/l) with calcium chloride administration in the venous line prior to returning the blood to the patient. The aim of this retrospective study was therefore to evaluate the adequacy of a canine protocol of regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in intermittent HD for acute kidney injury (AKI).",

Further studies are needed to assess the reversibility of renal dysfunction after treatment and the ability of these more sensitive and specific urinary markers to predict the risk for renal azotemia. Canine visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a multisystemic disease that can affect the kidneys. We evaluated changes in indices of renal function in dogs with VL. We measured serum creatinine (Cr), urea (Ur), urinary creatinine protein ratio (Up/c), systemic blood pressure (BP), fractional excretion of calcium (FECa), phosphorus (FEP), sodium (FENa) and magnesium (FEMg) in 41 dogs of various breeds with VL. We used the IRIS 2006 classification scheme to classify dogs into 2 groups (G1=IRIS 1-2; G2=IRIS 3-4), and compared them to dogs without renal impairment (control). Groups were compared by a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunnett's test for post-hoc comparsions; significance was set at P <0.05. Selected variables were compared by linear correlation.

A multiresistant CTX-M-15-producing clone of E. coli isolates ST131-O25b, has recently disseminated in three continents, including Portugal. The isolates belonging to this clone present significant virulence, and despite being described as multidrugresistant worldwide, susceptible non-ESBL-producing isolates have been also detected. Studies to assess the real prevalence of this lineage remain scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131) serotype O25-variant b worldwide pandemic clone among companion animal urinary tract infection (UTI) strains in Portugal and its association with fluoroquinolone-resistance and ESBL and AmpC cephalosporinases production. E. coli isolates (n=119, 87 from dogs and 32 from cats) were collected from 2004 until 2009 at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and at veterinary private practices mainly in the Lisbon area. The clone was screened by PCR with specific primers for the O25 serogroup and allele 3 of the pabB gene. Susceptibility testing and interpretation was performed using the disc diffusion method according to CLSI guidelines. ESBL and AmpC production was screened by double-disk synergy and antagonism test, respectively, and characterized by PCR using specific primers and full-gene PCR products sequencing. From a total of 119 animal E. coli isolates, 44 were O25b-pabB3 positive (37%). Five (11%) CTX-M producer E. coli O25b-pabB3 positive strains were isolated from 3 dogs (2 CTX-M-15 and 1 CTX-M-32) and 2 cats respectively (1 CTX-M-15 and 1 CTX-M-32). One E. coli O25b-pabB3 positive strain (2%) isolated from a dog produced the CMY-2 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase. The prevalence of ESBL and AmpC plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases among all E. coli isolates was 10% (n=12, one strain produced simultaneously a SHV-11 b-lactamase and a CMY-2 enzyme). All animal ESBL-and plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase producer strains were also ciprofloxacin-resistant. This study demonstrates that ST131-O25b is a prevalent clone in our area among companion animals with urinary tract infection and the majority of these isolates lack ESBL or plasmidic AmpC genes. Our findings are of critical relevance, as they show companion animals as ST131-O25b pandemic Escherichia coli clone reservoirs for human infections. Furthermore, transfer of resistance markers and resistance strains between animals and owners/caretakers is a strong possibility either by infection or direct contact. Our results also demonstrated that multidrug-resistant E. coli cephalosporinases and ESBL producing strains prevalence is increasing in uropathogenic E. coli and this fact may compromise effective therapeutic options.

Ataxia was reported in a retrospective review and in a few case reports, however precise clinical description, localisation and evolution of neurological signs are missing in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical, clinicopathological, and pathological data of dogs diagnosed with grape or raisin toxicity with particular emphasis on renal and neurological manifestations.Fifteen dogs were diagnosed with grape or raisin toxicity between November 2009 and March 2011. All dogs were presented with severe AKI with a mean creatinine at presentation of 1069 \u03bcmol/l (range 599-1743), urea 56.4 mmol/l (35.7-77.8), total calcium 3.2 mmol/l (2.25-3.97), ionized calcium 1.1 mmol/l (0.88-1.29), and phosphorus 4.5 mmol/l (2.51-7.93). Twelve dogs were treated with hemodialysis as part of their therapy (range 2-9 treatments).Eleven dogs (73 %) showed marked neurological signs, including moderately to severely reduced consciousness (n=9), seizures (n=2), generalized ataxia (n=11), hypermetric gait (n=2), and tremor (n=2). Based on these findings, the lesions were considered multifocal intracranial (cerebrum, cerebellum) in all dogs. These signs were observed at initial presentation in 10 dogs. Systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 160 mmHg) was present in 4/15 (26%) dogs with a range of 163-174 mmHg, but neurological signs in all 4 dogs persisted despite successful medical control of blood pressure. Similarly, neurological manifestation did not improve immediately with correction of azotemia. Laboratory parameters were not statistically different between dogs with or without neurological signs.Overall 8/15 (53%) dogs survived. All had at least partial renal recovery (creatinine below 270 \u03bcmol/l). Of these, 4 had neurological signs during their acute phase of illness and showed complete neurological recovery. Non-survivors died or were euthanized for renal related reasons (n=4) or other non-neurological causes (n=3). Necropsy of 4 dogs with neurological signs revealed toxic nephrosis consistent with grape toxicity. Histopathology of the brains were unremarkable.Severe neurological signs seem to be an important feature of intoxication with grapes or raisins and may even predominate the early clinical picture, mimicking ethylene glycol intoxication. These signs are reversible and likely unrelated to the degree of uremia. The pathophysiology of the neurological dysfunction could include direct neurotoxicity, electrolyte or mineral disturbances or increased intracranial pressure. Renal function may be altered by excitement during examination at a clinic, which may affect the outcome of diagnostic tests. The aim of the study was to investigate if glomerular filtration and renal concentration mechanisms are affected during clinical examinations in healthy dogs. Privately-owned male dogs aged 2-5 years; Labrador retrievers (32), Cavalier King Charles spaniels (21), Dachshunds (14) and Boxers (13) underwent physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, routine urine analysis and blood sampling by venipuncture for haematology and biochemistry for verification of health status, as part of the EU-funded Lupa-project.",

Voided morning urine samples were collected by owners at home. The examination began at 10 am and lasted 2 hours. A second voided urine sample was thereafter collected by owners.Urine density was measured by a digital refractometer. Urine samples were then frozen and kept at -70\u00b0C. Creatinine and cystatin-C were analysed by commercially validated ELISA kits, whereas ELISA kits for analysis of cortisol, aquaporin-2 and vasopressin were validated for dog urine in our laboratory.Cortisol, aquaporin-2 and vasopressin were assessed as ratios to creatinine concentrations (cort/crea, AQP-2/crea and VP/crea, respectively). For statistical analysis, all variables were logarithmically transformed, and a mixed model for repeated measurements with level of significance set at p<0.05 and Bonferroni adjustment was used.After the clinical examination, significant increases in urine concentrations of creatinine, cystatin-C, and in cort/crea were detected. AQP-2/crea and VP/crea did not change between samples. Urine density showed that dogs had concentrated urine within normal reference ranges both before and after examination, but density was significantly lower after the examination. This indicated a higher urine flow although dogs had not had access to drinking water since at least 7 am.In conclusion, the increase in creatinine and cystatin-C, concomitant with lowered density indicates higher glomerular filtration rate, probably due to excitement during examination as shown by the elevated cort/crea. AQP-2/crea and VP/crea did not change, which was expected with regard to the high density. Hence, a stress-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate is the most likely cause of the decrease in urinary density. These findings should be taken into consideration when evaluating results of urinary tests in a clinical environment. Renal damage is a common, yet not well documented, complication in canine babesiosis. Serum urea and creatinine concentrations are insensitive and aspecific markers for early detection of renal dysfunction. Furthermore, measurement of both serum urea and urine specific gravity are influenced by the haemolysis caused by babesiosis. Urinary markers may allow a more sensitive assessment of renal dysfunction and additionally may enhance the specificity as they are able to localize renal dysfunction.",
