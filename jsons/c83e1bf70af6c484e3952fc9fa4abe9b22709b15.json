            "text": "many guidelines and recommendations have been established to reduce the occupational risk while educating surgeons to make them better prepared to operate on HIV-positive patients. 2 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) (Coronavirus disease 2019 ), which seems to be highly contagious and has easily spread worldwide, is a much different virus causing a much different disease. Orthopaedic surgeons should be fully aware of the current situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare to take proper precautions against the occupational risk of exposure, especially in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic surgical patients. By April 7, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 was responsible for 1,383,436 confirmed cases of COVID-19, involving 209 countries around the world; 378,881 cases have been confirmed in the United States. As an example, Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports an estimated 2.8 million trauma patients hospitalized in the United States. In addition, 791,000 older patients are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries each year. 3 Gleaning from the trauma literature, these data suggest an increased likelihood of engaging in COVID-19 orthopaedic patients in our hospitals. Thousands of healthcare providers (HCP) have been infected with COVID-19, despite their adherence to infection control measures. 4 Approximately 14% of Spain's confirmed cases are in medical professionals, per the Spanish minister of health. Despite the current definitions for diagnosing symptomatic COVID-19 patients, the transmission from an asymptomatic carrier has been documented between 25% and 50%. 5 It is necessary for the orthopaedic community to be prepared for this global pandemic emergency. This is an occupational hazard not only to orthopaedic surgeons and other health-care providers but also to the families and neighbors of exposed healthcare providers. There is still no definitive consensus of the pandemics' behavior, COVID-19 mode of transmission, diagnostic criteria, and management protocols. Preparation for a pandemic involves considering the increasing levels of protection and infection control and how they should be implemented during different phases of the pandemic. In the OR setting, these measures include the following: modification of healthcare infrastructure and processes, educating staff and patients, implementing infection control strategies, and administrative and clinical measures. The surgical management of traumatic injuries requires a complex environment with multiple stakeholders including surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, OR attendants, and medical staff; it can be a real challenge to align the perspectives and concerns of all parties The primary aim of this article is to help define the COVID-19 crisis and discuss effective management strategies. This article provides a brief summary of the current situation and understanding of the pandemic, diagnostic criteria, and attempts to forecast the extent and prognosis. Finally, recommending precautions and preventive actions to reduce the occupational risk in treating clinically suspected/confirmed COVID-19 surgical patients. ",

COVID-19 is presumed to spread directly via infectious respiratory droplets and close contact (because SARS-CoV-2 cannot survive without a carrier). 12 However, these transmission modes do not explain all cases. Recent data have shown that COVID-19 might survive and be transmitted indirectly from virus contamination of common surfaces and objects after virus aerosolization in a confined space with by infected individuals. 12 The incubation period for COVID-19 is approximately 4 days, and studies suggest that it may range anywhere from 2 to 14 days. [13] [14] [15] A recent study investigating SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens found that RNA virus detected in blood samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients (3 of 307; 1%). 16 Huang et al 17 reported that 15% of patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 had viral RNA in their plasma. The implications of these findings are still unclear, and there are no reported cases of transfusiontransmitted coronaviruses through April 5, 2020. However, continued vigilance is essential. Despite studies detecting viral RNA in the serum or plasma of confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients, blood transmission and infectivity are still not fully understood. Because there is little evidence and vague guidelines for blood transfusion in the current setting, it is recommended to recuse anyone with symptoms or signs of respiratory illness from blood donation. 18 The US FDA has suggested to retrieve and quarantine any blood products collected in the 28 days before, or after, either COVID-19 disease onset or possible exposure to individuals who are COVID-19 positive. 18 Theoretically, viremia in patients with asymptomatic or confirmed COVID-19 patients could pose a risk of transmissibility to the orthopaedic team during aerosolized blood-generating procedures. 19 The use of high-speed drills, bone saws, reamers, electrocautery, and ultrasonic scalpels generate significant amounts of aerosols, increasing the risk of viral contamination of the environment. 20 A recent Canadian study described lowfidelity simulation training to evolve the modified PPE used for aerosolgenerating procedures of suspected/ confirmed COVID-19 patients and assess the sites of contamination 21 The spread of the aerosolized respiratory secretions and contamination sites were visualized with a commercial powder product and ultraviolet light. They demonstrated a significant amount of contamination on the provider's neck, base of the wrist, and their lower pants and shoes. These sites, however, are probably not associated with a direct method of transmission for SARS-CoV-2. However, there are definite sources of self-contamination during PPE doffing. In addition, the disposable AAMI Level-III fluid-resistant, surgical gowns or coveralls are recommended because they detected no contamination of scrubs beneath the surgical gown compared with reusable surgical gowns (AAMI, Level-II). The AAMI, level-II gowns were permeable to aerosolized secretions. The recommended PPE for performing respiratory aerosol or aerosolized blood-generating procedures for suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients (Table 1) :",

Reuse practice is permitted for a single person use (no-sharing). Reuse and reprocessing of the N-95 mask guidelines have been released by the CDC and include the use of ultraviolet light processing, hydrogen peroxide in either liquid or vaporized state, and moist heating decontamination. 24 These guidelines should be reviewed at length before attempting reprocessing of equipment to prevent potentially catastrophic error. Extended use refers to the practice of using the same respirators for repeated close contact encounters with multiple patients, without doffing it between the encounters. This practice might be preferred over reuse, assuming this would reduce the risk of self-contamination through frequent donning and doffing of the same equipment. These practices vary between institutions especially for using N-95 masks. Theoretically, the HCP could extend this and tolerate wearing N-95 masks for up to 8 to 12 hours. 25, 26 However, most providers usually take breaks during shifts for lunch/toilets. Therefore, extended use beyond 4 hours might be impractical in most settings, 27 although limited reuse practice could be adopted with negative or low-risk patients. 28 ",

Ideally, two types of hospital segregation should be done. Locationbased segregation of orthopaedic staff reduces the potential risk of cross-infection. Orthopaedic surgeons, for example, should not be performing screening examinations on the general public because of the risk of exposure. Geographic segregation within the OR complex limits the OR traffic, decreases the exposure, and minimizes the contamination zone. 30 With the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, orthopaedic staff should be segregated into those who are treating suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients and those who are treating noninfective patients when possible is not. This however may not be possible in smaller hospital systems and practices. Besides screening and isolation of high-risk, confirmed COVID-19 patients, strict and frequent screening of the segregated OR staff is mandatory. Members of the segregated or exposed staff should immediately report any signs of illness and must be taken off duty immediately. In addition, all contact events between patients and staff must be recorded so that contact lation, open airway suction as much as possible.

A recent study at the University of Illinois Chicago 56 assessed the PPE doffing practices of healthcare workers. The study demonstrated that 90% of observed PPE doffing was incorrect regarding the doffing sequence, doffing technique, or use of appropriate PPE. 56 Another survey showed that 14.9% of healthcare personnel did not receive previous training for appropriate PPE doffing practices. 57 Training and education might flatten the curve of crossinfection and self-contamination. Training and education of the surgical staff should be continually emphasized. It is imperative that all staff be taught the proper sequential methods of donning and doffing of PPE and mask-fitting techniques to minimize the risk of self-contamination. Frequent audits of infection control must be conducted. A trained observer should be assigned for each emergent operation to identify the weaknesses and implement the necessary steps.",
