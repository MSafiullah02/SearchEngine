The study received investigational review board waiver approval. Patients were included if they had both a positive virus on PCR and a PCT value <0.25 ng/mL within 48 hours of each other, and at least 1 active systemic antibiotic. An automated, EMR best practice alert (BPA) for these patients was implemented in December 2017 (Figure 1) in Epic (Verona, Wisconsin; www.epic.com). The alert fired upon any provider opening an EMR when criteria were met. It contained the message \u201cantimicrobial stewardship alert: your patient has a positive viral PCR + negative procalcitonin + one or more antibiotics ordered. These results suggest viral infection\u2014please reassess necessity of antibiotics as indicated.\u201d It contained the PCR and PCT results and listed active antibiotics. Three options to proceed were available: \u201cacknowledge\u201d; \u201cdoes not meet criteria\u201d; and \u201cnot making antimicrobial decisions.\u201d The first 2 suppressed the alert permanently, and the last allowed it to continue firing each time the EMR was opened, until 1 of the other 2 options were selected. Electronic time stamps allowed assessment of provider responses and alert firing time(s). The prospective BPA group included all patients on which the alert fired from 15 December 2017 to 28 February 2018. The retrospective comparator group included patients who met the alert firing criteria from 1 December 2015 to 30 March 2016. Patients were excluded if they were <18 years old or if antibiotics were also being used for concomitant, nonrespiratory indications. These were identified based on indications included with antibiotic orders (which are required for all antimicrobial orders at our institution), as well as manual records review.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown inpatient viral respiratory infection management to have vast potential for targeted intervention, as providers often continue antibiotic therapy even when there is a low likelihood of bacterial involvement. A study by Timbrook and colleagues found low rates of antibiotic discontinuation in patients with positive viral respiratory PCR, negative PCT, or both, which were suggestive of viral etiology. Because this study did not include a direct intervention, the authors concluded that clinician intervention was likely needed to affect antibiotic prescribing in this subset of patients [17]. Branche and colleagues implemented a 1:1 randomized feasibility study in similar patients using respiratory PCR and PCT testing. In contrast to the previous study, they employed an intervention to inform providers of likely viral infections, though no difference was found in antibiotic use. However, they did detect a reduction in antibiotic discharge prescriptions by 25%, which is in line with our findings of nearly 28% [20]. They note that they may have encountered a spillover effect, in which their intervention with the study group indirectly influenced the practices of providers in the control group. Our study was able to avoid this as it was carried out in 2 distinct time periods with no overlap. Importantly, the Branche study emphasized the need for provider intervention to leverage diagnostic testing output [20]. A study by File and colleagues evaluated respiratory PCR results coupled with PCR and/or active antimicrobial stewardship intervention. Stewardship input, as compared to availability of PCR plus PCT alone, yielded the most significant reduction in antibiotic use, though this required contact with providers [21]. Our findings suggest that similar efforts can be achieved without direct stewardship input, which allows shifting of efforts to other high-risk patients.",

By coupling temporally related PCT values (within 48 hours) to viral PCR results, we were able to suggest to providers a subset of patients who were unlikely to have bacterial coinfection.

While providers may not be willing to immediately discontinue antibiotics in some cases, they may still do so earlier than if they had not been prompted with the initial EMR alert. A question of what factors caused providers to continue antibiotics is raised. In their follow-up analysis of their randomized trial, Branche and colleagues found that while several factors were mentioned by providers as reasons for deviation from their PCT de-escalation protocol including illness severity, fever, abnormal complete blood count, and others, only diagnosis of pneumonia was significantly associated with nonadherence [25].

            "text": "Our study did have limitations. First, our evaluation of data from a single health system may not be representative of prescribing of other institutions. Second, the retrospective design did not allow for the most minimally biased comparison between the groups. While our study did attempt to minimize confounding variables, there are always potential unidentified effects. One such effect may have been differences in influenza seasons. The 2017\u20132018 influenza season was more severe than the 2015\u20132016 season, as evidenced by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza data [29]. Our regression analysis still supported a significant reduction in days of therapy with the BPA. We began collecting the prospective data immediately after the alert was launched in December 2017, not allowing for an adaptation period to lapse, which may have skewed the true effect of the BPA. Another limitation was nonconsistent timing of the BPA regarding days of therapy. It is possible that earlier firing of BPA led toward earlier discontinuation of antibiotics. However, a temporal relationship cannot be established based on our data alone. A future study might examine how the timing relates to the outcome to further determine BPA effect on antibiotic prescribing. Other limitations to the study included lack of stratification by provider and lack of follow-up on influence of bacterial culture result with therapy duration. It is possible certain providers were inherently more open or resistant to the alert intent, which may lend itself to more targeted feedback in the future when providers decline a suggestion. Other factors beyond PCR and PCT results may have influenced treatment decisions. For example, imaging changes can affect prescriber habits, though imaging alone cannot differentiate bacterial vs viral illness. Another consideration is that our alert does not fire when only respiratory PCR or PCT is suggestive of viral infection, nor does the alert include standalone PCR tests such as influenza or influenza/RSV combination tests. Finally, an issue with the BPA is that it fires for all providers. If one inadvertently selects \u201cacknowledge\u201d or \u201cdoes not meet criteria,\u201d the alert stops firing. We did not track unintentional alert suppression but realize that it could have affected success rate of the alert.",

It also proves that well-constructed EMR provider alerts that integrate PCR, PCT, and antibiotic data can target patients in whom antibiotic therapy can be rapidly narrowed, without need for direct antimicrobial stewardship oversight. This minimally invasive stewardship practice can easily be replicated by other institutions and represents a step forward in the fight against antibiotic misuse.",
