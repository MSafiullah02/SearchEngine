The international spread of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ease of global travel, and societal dynamics, immunologic naivet\u00e9 of the host population, and muted innate immune responses. Based on these factors and the expanding geographic scale of the disease, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic-the first caused by a coronavirus. In this review, we summarize the current epidemiological status of COVID-19 and consider the virological and immunological lessons, animal models, and tools developed in response to prior SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks that can serve as resources for development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics",

The entry of the virus is through receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by fusion of viral and host cell membranes [31] . A fusion event also occurs between viral particles and the plasma membrane on the cell surface [32] . Exposure to low pH in the endosome activates host proteases, such as cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 that cleave the S protein [31] .

Under this conformation, SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 domains are separated by a flexible loop containing a cleavage site that is exposed and accessible to host proteases ( Figure 4A ). Cleavage triggers irreversible conformational changes that are required for membrane fusion to occur [32, 42, 43] .",

The earlier SARS-CoV encodes a single arginine [44] while SARS-CoV-2 encodes PRRAR [45] . Both viral S proteins are primed by the serine protease TMPRSS2 in human cells [30] , while SARS-CoV-2 can additionally be cleaved by furin at its unique RRAR site. It has been hypothesized that furinmediated precleavage at the S1/S2 site is important for subsequent S activation by TMPRSS2 as demonstrated previously for other CoVs [30, 46] . The proline inserted before the RRAR cleavage site could promote addition of O-linked glycans [47] . However, the importance of this proline and any associated glycans are not yet understood. The S2' cleavage site for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Arg 797 and Arg 815 respectively) is further required to mediate membrane fusion and entry [42] . Replication-defective VSV particles displaying either SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV S proteins can infect the same range of cell lines, suggesting that the addition of a new cleavage site and proline do not change virus tropism [30] .",

Dysregulation of cytokine production resulting in a cytokine storm is believed to be associated with disease severity. Elevated secretion of cytokines, particularly IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10, GCSF, MCP-1, MIP1\u03b1 and TNF\u03b1 were found in severe COVID-19 patient (Figure 3) [7, 56, 57] . Similarly, increased level of serum cytokines was found in SARS [58, 59] and MERS patients [60] . Meanwhile, both signal transduction and production of type I IFN, the cytokine that limits viral spread by elevating neighboring cells to antiviral status, were delayed in SARS [59] and MERS patients [60] . Delayed IFN responses permit robust viral replication, accumulation of cytokine/chemokine producing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f monocytes/macrophages, and increase in disease severity in SARS-CoV [61] and MERS-CoV [62] infected mice. Similarly, MERS-CoV M, ORF 4a, ORF 4b and ORF 5 antagonized IFN pathways and in turn diminished type I IFN production [63] . Impaired type I IFN response and uncontrolled inflammatory response subsequently contribute to adverse disease outcomes. In fact, different type I IFNs have been shown to have antiviral effects against both SARS-CoV [64] and MERS-CoV [65] in vitro. However, there is no clear evidence that type I IFN therapies had direct benefit for SARS and MERS patients [64, 66] .",

The mean time for seroconversion in SARS patients was around 2 weeks after disease onset [78] . Whether neutralizing antibodies can offer protection from or limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently unclear. In rhesus macaques re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 28 days after prior challenge, no viral replication was observed and the animals exhibited no clinical signs, but the animals showed increasing titers of neutralizing antibodies after re-challenge [79] .

SARS infections in these mice are lethal [87] . Several other mouse strains including J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 C57BL/6, 129S Sv/Ev and STAT1 -/mice have been reported to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection [88] . Additionally, the use of a virus adapted to mice (SARS-MA15, SARS-CoV passaged 15 in BALB/c mice) produces clinical disease in young (6-8 week-old) BALB/c mice [89] that is similar to ARDS observed in humans [90] . For MERS, transgenic mice encoding human DPP4 showed viral replication with interstitial pneumonia [91] . Thus, older BALB/c mice, hACE2 transgenic mice, mice lacking one or more components of the IFN system, and mouse-adapted viruses will likely be important tools for developing mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease. In fact, a recent study has already shown that hACE2 transgenic mice with SARS-CoV-2 infection reproduce the clinical symptoms of disease, support virus replication in lung tissue [92] .

The coronavirus (CoV) life cycle initiates with the binding of spike proteins on the virion surface to their specific receptor (e.g., ACE2 for SAR-CoV-2) on target cells. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, S protein undergoes a conformational change and viral genomic RNA are released into the cytoplasm. Viral genomic RNA functions as mRNA which is translated into polyproteins (pp) pp1a and pp1ab, which are then proteolytically cleaved into mature non-structural proteins (nsps). Many nsps synergize to modify the ER membrane to form double membrane vesicles (DMVs) where transcription of genomic and subgenomic RNA occurs. The 5'-ends' truncated subgenomic RNA are used as templates to translate structural (S, E, M and N) and accessory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 proteins. S, E and M assemble together with nucleocapsid (one copy of viral genome encapsulated by N protein) at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and viral progeny are released by exocytosis. Host immune responses are triggered by danger signals from infected cells or free virions which are recognized by innate immune cells. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines can be seen in asymptomatic to mild cases. Exuberated cytokine production resulting in cytokine storm exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Lymphopenia (T and B cells) and neutrophil infiltration into infected sites contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Several CoV proteins have been reported to be capable of inhibiting the type I IFN signaling pathway. Figure created with BioRender (biorender.com).",
