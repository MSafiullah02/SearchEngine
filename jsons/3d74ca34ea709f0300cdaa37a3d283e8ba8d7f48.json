These include electronic devices (such as field effect transistors); microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices such as micro and nanocantilevers; simple metallic and semiconductor electrodes for electrochemical (amperometric, voltammetric, and impedimetric) detection; optical devices including fibers and fiber bundles (for absorption, fluorescence, luminescence, and chemiluminescence); quartz-crystal oscillating devices; and mass spectrometry. Amongst these methods are those described as direct and others that are indirect. Direct methods derive their signals from the hybridization reaction directly, for example, quartz crystal oscillators, impedimetric biochips, micro-and nanocantilevers, or interferometers. These detection methods exemplify responses that require no label and are therefore also referred to as label-free methods. Although label-free, their signals may be enhanced, limits of detection lowered, sensitivity increased, and dynamic ranges attenuated by the use of nanoparticle or chemically responsive labels. Indirect methods derive their signals from the measurement of a label, for example, a radioactive isotope or a fluorescence label. Each of these methods is briefly described in the succeeding paragraphs. Ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) have allowed for greater specificities to be achieved, especially for single-use applications. In the 1970s, improvements in semiconductor technology led to the development of the field-effect transistor (FET) that usurped the ISE platform. The FET is a very high impedance transistor and most sensitive measurements of small potentials requiring very low currents are made using this technology. However, the FET proved expensive to produce and as such has yet to achieve its full commercial potential; in no small part because of difficulties with regard to its reliability in operation. Development and commercialization of pH-FETs and the emergence of organic thin film field effect transistors (TFTs) suggests that DNA FETs may become a technological and commercial possibility.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biochip Transduction Methods"}, {"text": "MEMS devices are proving popular as a modern method for the detection of biomolecules.

The microelectrode restricts the current to a few nanoamperes with the result that the concentration of the test substance in solution remains essentially unchanged after the experiment (7) . Amperometry is the application of voltammetric measurements at a fixed potential to detect changes in the current as a function of the chemical potential of an electroactive species.

When the evanescent wave is used to excite fluorescent molecules bound to the surface of the waveguide, the phenomenon is termed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF).

In fiber optic devices, it is possible to use small polymer microspheres coated with an absorbing or fluorescent dye.

The most attractive features of microarrays are throughput and consequently, speed of analysis. The potential for miniaturization with its attendant reduction in sample volume does exist, but is still to be fully realized.

This creates pressures from two opposing sides: the need to have licensed access to a sufficiently large number of genes to achieve the diagnostic purpose and the competing need to limit the total number of genes to make the diagnostic commercially viable. To eliminate this downward pressure, patent licensing strategies may evolve to facilitate the exchange of rights between the competing entities who \"own\" the rights in the legion of genes utilized on the biochip platforms. \"An equitable and streamlined mechanism for licensing genes and alleles would help to promote continued research, development and commercialization\" (50) .

The potential for economies of scale in the screening of patients must be balanced by the patient's right to privacy protection. The potential for a full genomic scan to reveal not just what is currently known about an individual, but also, once entered into a database, that which may be known in the future, not just about an individual but also about their progeny, siblings, and lineage, must dampen enthusiasm for such a genomic screen. The solution is the development of specific gene chips, diagnostic and prognostic biochips that target specific disease states or genetic conditions. It is evident that the current genomic gene chips will be replaced by more dedicated Oncochips \u00ae , arthritis chips, and so on, which assure individual protection and meet the rigors required for IRB approval. A fourth issue related to diagnostic biochip testing arises with the accumulation of detailed health information in databanks. \"Such databanks are powerful and valuable tools to help understand and counteract disease processes\" but raise questions of equity of access and parity of use in structuring inquiry for societal benefits (52) . Of course, such issues must be balanced by the intellectual property rights of those who invest in the development of such databases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1361, "end": 1365, "text": "(52)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Issues Related to Diagnostic Biochips"}, {"text": "The diagnostic biochip will emerge as a highly quantitative, clinically focused molecular diagnostic tool for the modern diagnostics laboratory. However, the road to this destination is filled with regulatory requirements and societal concerns, to which the technological and practitioner communities must be cognizant and responsive. Furthermore, the technology, in its current format, is labor-intensive and quite expensive. There is need for alternative formats that focus on specific diagnostic or prognostic applications within targeted disease states. Better methods of manufacture and detection are being developed, including direct detection of hybridization by electric current, based on the fact that single-stranded DNA conducts electrons at a different rate than double-stranded DNA. In the near future, nucleic acid nanotechnology may prove very useful in DNA diagnostics. Research has led to advanced nucleic acid nanostructures and devices, semisynthetic DNA-protein conjugates, and efficient assembly of individual oligonucleotidefunctionalized nanoparticles in two-and three-dimensional networks (53) . Some of these assemblies have already proven useful for diagnostic purposes (54, 55) and the construction of nanometer-sized DNA-based nanowires has been achieved (56).
