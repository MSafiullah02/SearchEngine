It has been clearly established that intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired limb muscle weakness is a frequent condition, associated with poor prognosis [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Although the consequences of respiratory muscle weakness have been less extensively investigated, some evidences suggest that it may be a risk factor for prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation [7] , associated with a higher risk of readmission [8] and higher mortality [9] . Diaphragm dysfunction is frequent in the intensive care unit (more than 60% of mechanically ventilated patients [10] ) and is associated with difficult and prolonged weaning and poor Open Access *Correspondence: martin.dres@aphp.fr 1 Service de Pneumologie, M\u00e9decine intensive -R\u00e9animation (D\u00e9partement \"R3S\"), AP-HP, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Charles Foix, 75013 Paris, France Full list of author information is available at the end of the article prognosis [11] [12] [13] [14] . Causes of diaphragm dysfunction are multifactorial and no specific treatment is currently available [10] . Diaphragm dysfunction is responsible for prolonged mechanical ventilation and may contribute to the development of \"chronic critical illness\", a devastating condition for patients and their families [15] . While the diaphragm undoubtedly plays a crucial role to ensure prompt and safe weaning from mechanical ventilation, recent data suggest that a substantial proportion of patients (up to 44%) can be successfully weaned from the ventilator despite the presence of diaphragm dysfunction [13, 14, 16] . Nevertheless, in contrast with the reported negative impact of ICU-acquired weakness on long-term survival and disabilities [3, 4, 17] , it remains unclear whether diaphragm dysfunction per se is responsible for poor medium-term and long-term prognosis. The present study therefore used a previous cohort study conducted in our institution [13] to follow up mechanically ventilated patients in whom diaphragm and limb muscle functions were investigated at the time of liberation from mechanical ventilation. We tested the hypothesis that diaphragm dysfunction is associated with negative longterm outcomes and that the coexistence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-AW has a particular association on long-term prognosis, in line with the known negative synergistic effects of the two conditions on short-term prognosis.",

The dates of ICU admission, intubation, first spontaneous breathing trial, extubation, ICU discharge, hospital discharge and ICU and hospital death were obtained from the hospital medical charts. Survival and health-related quality of life assessment was performed as described below. Hospital medical charts were analysed to identify the patient's status (dead or alive) and dates over a 2-year period following inclusion in the study. Patients alive 2 years after inclusion were contacted by phone by the first author. The patient was asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life [24, 25] . The SF-36 questionnaire is a general quality of life questionnaire that evaluates physical and emotional quality of life. The SF-36 questionnaire includes eight multiple-item scales that assess physical functioning, social functioning, physical role, emotional role, mental health, pain, vitality, and general health [26] . Interviews were conducted by a single investigator blinded to the patient's status in relation to the presence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICUacquired weakness in the ICU.",

The main findings can be summarized as follows: (1) 2-year survival was much better in patients without diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness at the time of liberation from mechanical ventilation than in patients presenting both of these conditions (79% versus 36%, respectively); (2) survival was not significantly different between patients with diaphragm dysfunction without ICU-acquired weakness and patients not presenting either of the two conditions (77% versus 79%, respectively); (3) survival appeared to be much more markedly influenced by the presence of ICU-acquired weakness than by the presence of diaphragm dysfunction and (4) the study failed [3] . In a study with prolonged follow-up (up to 1 year), Hermans et al. reported a 68% survival rate in patients with ICUacquired weakness [4] . In our study, patients with ICUacquired weakness had a 2-year survival of 46%. This lower survival rate in our cohort could be explained by the timing of the assessment of ICU-acquired weakness (earlier in our study than in other studies) and the prolonged duration of follow-up. It remains unclear whether diaphragm dysfunction is one of several features of ICUacquired weakness or whether the two conditions are distinct [7, 13, 27] . Two studies conducted at the time of weaning demonstrated a weak but significant correlation between diaphragm function and limb muscle strength [13, 14] . One of these studies also suggested a difference in prognosis between the two conditions, as ICU-acquired weakness was more strongly associated with prolonged hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, while diaphragm dysfunction was mostly associated with difficult/prolonged weaning and ICU and hospital mortality [13] . The present study reports novel findings in this context, suggesting that ICU-acquired weakness may be associated with a more severe impact on long-term outcome than diaphragm dysfunction. The association of diaphragm dysfunction with longterm prognosis has never been previously investigated. One study investigated the impact of global respiratory weakness (as assessed by the maximal inspiratory pressure) and reported a higher 1-year mortality (31%) in the group of patients with low maximal inspiratory pressure compared to patients with high maximal inspiratory pressure, in whom the 1-year mortality was 7% [9] . However, limb muscle strength was not analysed in this study. Our findings suggest that the long-term prognosis of these patients is mainly driven by the presence of ICUacquired weakness rather than diaphragm dysfunction. Nevertheless, as expected, the co-existence of these two conditions was associated with a poor survival. The presence of diaphragm dysfunction in critically ill patients has been associated with poor short-term prognosis in some studies [11, 13, 14, 28] , but not in others [29, 30] .",

These findings are in contrast with previous data reporting substantial impairments in physical function and health-related quality of life in acute lung injury survivors [31] . This discrepancy may be explained by the timing of ICU-acquired weakness evaluation (after a few days of mechanical ventilation in our study as compared to 3 months after the acute lung injury in the study by Fan et al.) and the different period of time for both investigations (2014-2015 in our study versus 2004-2007 in the study by Fan et al.) [31] . Although not statistically significant, the SF-36 questionnaire score indicated better health-related quality of life in patients not presenting either of these two conditions. Importantly, this difference may be underestimated by the competitive risk of death. The findings of this study could possibly be explained by a lack of power, but they could also be the consequence of self-adaptive quality of life perception [32] . Eventually, the findings on SF-36 questionnaire should be considered as an exploratory analysis according to the sample size and warrant further studies.",

In addition, our study provides insight into the association of diaphragm dysfunction and ICUacquired weakness with survival and quality of life over a long period of time after the ICU stay. However, some limitations must be acknowledged. The first and main limitation concerns the small sample size finally analysed. Indeed, this is a cohort study with a significant risk of confounding and relatively small event rates. As such the statistical analyses do not adjust for potential confounding and explore simple associations. Our findings must therefore be interpreted cautiously and larger studies are warranted. Secondly, diaphragm function and limb muscle strength were not repeatedly assessed in our study. Consequently, the findings in terms of survival and quality of life could not be correlated with possible recovery of either diaphragm function or limb muscle strength. Thirdly, ICU-acquired weakness was assessed with MRC score that relies on the cooperation of the patients. Therefore, even if patients were confirmed awake, it is a volitional measurement that may be associated with a ceiling effect and poor responsiveness. Fourthly, due to small size of the cohort, competing risk of death could not be take into account which may have created a bias in the assessment of health care quality of life.",

Eventually, the co-existence of both diseases was associated with the worse outcome.",
