A considerable amount of research demonstrates that alcohol has a degenerative effect on the brain with chronic consumption ultimately leading to alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive function including decreased working memory and problem solving ability (Brust, 2010). Early pathological studies of alcoholics found that brain volume reduction was largely due to loss of white matter (WM) (Sutherland et al., 2014; Harper and Kril, 1985; De la Monte, 1988). Neurodegenerative effects are also seen but, in alcoholics without concomitant thiamine deficiency, these tend to be restricted to the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997). These findings have been confirmed by neuroimaging studies with the changes being, at least partially, reversible with abstinence (Buhler and Mann, 2011; Pfefferbaum et al., 2014).",

However, unlike ARBD, there is no consensus on the effects on brain atrophy with previous studies reporting increased temporal (Gazdzinski et al., 2005) and cingulate WM volumes (Yu et al., 2011), or no significant change in WM volume (Durazzo et al., 2007; Gallinat et al., 2006; Paul, 2008 #7360). However, decreased WM integrity has been consistently reported (Paul et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011). Furthermore, it is unclear what component(s) of tobacco smoke might be responsible. There are more than 4000 toxic compounds in tobacco smoke including carbon monoxide, aldehydes and dihydroxybenzenes. There are also several kinds of tobacco specific nitrosamines, of which 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (also known as nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK)) is the most studied. Most studies have focused on NNK's carcinogenic effects but sub-mutagenic doses (2 mg/kg), that are known to be hepatotoxic (Zabala et al., 2015), may also have neurodegenerative effects, as seen with other nitrosamines such as streptozotocin (Lester-Coll et al., 2006).",

Notwithstanding there was less sampling of unmyelinated fibres in the study, it does appear that ethanol, but not NNK, is directly neurotoxic. These results are consistent with the widespread WM loss seen in ARBD (de la Monte, 1988; Kril et al., 1997; Sutherland et al., 2014). In the absence of TEM studies on ARBD the effect of ethanol on unmyelinated fibres appears consistent with the moderate but localized GM atrophy and neuronal loss seen in areas such as the prefrontal cortex (Harper and Kril, 1989; Kril et al., 1997).",

A MRI study by Gazdzinski et al. (2005) found significant GM losses in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes in alcoholics (Gazdzinski et al., 2005). When this group re-analysed their results they found that these reductions were largely found in smoking alcoholics compared rather than non-smoking alcoholics (Durazzo et al., 2007). These findings, along with greater WM loss also in smoking alcoholics, have since been replicated (Luhar et al., 2013; Durazzo et al., 2014). In terms of a sparing effect of smoking on neuronal damage, our own work using autopsy tissue suggested trends towards increased volume in smokers in two GM regions (the supramarginal and sensory cortex) but there was no correlation to smoking pack-years (McCorkindale et al., 2016).",

They also showed that the combined exposures decreased the expression proteins such as myelin-associated glycoprotein, proteolipid protein 1 and myelin basic protein in mature oligodendrocytes. Whereas there was increased expression of immature oligodendroglial genes such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide. Interestingly, ethanol blocked these inhibitory effects.

(2007) looked at the interaction between alcohol and thiamine deficiency on myelin fibres in the corpus callosum of 18-months male Wistar alcohol-preferring rats. They found that the alcohol/thiamine deficient (pyrithamine) group had smaller fibres, lower myelinated fibre diameter, thinner myelin sheaths but greater myelinated fibre density. There were interactions between alcohol and thiamine deficiency but the latter was largely responsible for WM damage seen. He et al. suggested that a selective loss or shrinkage of large fibres was responsible for the increase in myelinated fibre density. The more subtle alcohol effects reported by He et al. may reflect the chronic, intermittent exposure over 12 months, the strain and the age of the rats. Interestingly, a previous TEM study in human postmortem tissue of chronic alcoholics also failed to show a difference in WM volume or myelinated fibre diameter (Tang et al., 2004). However, Tang et al. did note a non-significant reduction (9%) subcortical WM in alcoholics, similar to the 11% reduction in total WM seen in a previous volumetric study by their group (Jensen and Pakkenberg, 1993) and the 12% reduction in total WM reported recently by our group (McCorkindale et al., 2016).",

The integrity of fibres in the frontal lobe WM of Long Evans rats were collectively measured using four indices: (A) A high-resolution electron micrograph shows the features measured to derive the four indices. Myelinated and unmyelinated (black arrows) fibres were enumerated in 3000\u00d7 and 15,000\u00d7 magnified digital images, respectively. The diameter of those myelinated fibres (long dashed lines) in, or approximately in, cross section were measured using the image analysis software, Image J. Myelin sheath thickness was calculated by subtracting the axon diameter (short dashed lines) from the fibre diameter and dividing the difference by two. Myelinated fibres that were not in cross section (asterisks) were excluded from the analysis. Scale bar 0.5 \u03bcm. Box plots demonstrate the effect of ethanol (ET), NNK and NNK + ethanol on (B) mean myelinated fibre density and (C) mean myelinated fibre diameter. Each plot represents the mean data from 10 rats (or 9 in the combined treatment group) while the box itself shows the median and 75% and 25% quartiles. The whiskers define data that fall within the following range: third quartile + 1.5*(interquartile range) and first quartile \u2013 1.5*(interquartile range). (D) A mosaic histogram shows the distribution of small (\u2264 0.42 \u03bcm, white), medium (> 0.42 \u2264 0.6 \u03bcm, grey) and large (> 0.6 \u03bcm, black) myelinated fibres in the ethanol (ET)-, NNK-, co-treated and control groups.
