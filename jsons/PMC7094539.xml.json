China has had a growing nursing profession with baccalaureate and master\u2019s education begun in the 1900s, and doctoral education initiated in 2004. However, in China, higher educated (those with baccalaureate degrees and beyond) nurses are more likely than less well-educated nurses to leave nursing. This greater turnover of more highly educated nurses is noteworthy because they represent future leadership of the profession in China.7, 8\n",

The concepts of Northern and Southern China originate from differences in climate, geography, culture, and physical traits, as well as several periods of actual political division in history.11 There are also major differences in language, cuisine, and popular entertainment forms. During the China Economic Reforms of the 1980s, Southern China developed much faster than Northern China, which led to the unbalanced regional economic development. To date, most nurses\u2019 job satisfaction and relevant studies in China have focused on a certain region, and no documented studies have explored the regional difference impact on nurses\u2019 job satisfaction. Considering that the huge discrepancy of culture, economy, and perspectives from Southern and Northern China may play a role on nurses\u2019 job satisfaction, this study addressed the comparison between the southern and northern hospitals in mainland China.",

Job satisfaction is a frequently studied variable in organizational behavior research and also a central variable in both research and theory of organizational phenomena ranging from job design to supervision.13 High job satisfaction improves the ability of the health organization to recruit and retain nurses.14, 15 Tourangeau and Cranley16 reported a relationship between nurses\u2019 job retention and their satisfaction with pay and benefits, scheduling, control (autonomy), responsibility, and professional opportunities. In a study that included 5 countries, Aiken and colleagues found that job dissatisfaction among nurses was highest in the United States (41%) followed by Scotland (38%), England (36%), Canada (33%), and Germany (17%).17 A Chinese study found that more than half of respondents (53.7%) who were Chinese nurses were satisfied with their jobs.10 Worldwide evidence indicates that job satisfaction is a major predictor of nursing absenteeism, burnout, turnover, and intention to quit9, 18, 19, 20 and has the largest effect on nurses\u2019 intent to stay and is important in predicting nurses\u2019 retention.21, 22, 23 Therefore, it is incumbent upon health care administrators and nursing managers to assess nurses\u2019 job satisfaction to develop strategies to improve nurses\u2019 retention.",

Thus, a larger sample from broader scopes of hospitals has to be included in further research using a randomized sampling technique. Third, because the data were collected in 2006, this study may serve as providing an essential base for comparison with the current situation because the role of nursing and the economy in China have evolved since that time.",

The findings of this study may help Chinese health care administrators develop strategies in improving nurses\u2019 job satisfaction that take regional characteristics into consideration, such as educational, income and consumption level, and philosophical and cultural differences. In addition, nurse managers can enable nurses to experience professional satisfaction, personal balance, and opportunities for choices by offering flexible scheduling options. The results of this study are considered a baseline for future research with a larger and more homogenous sample to enhance generalization of the results. Furthermore, the noteworthy differences between regions in cultural values, political status, economic levels, and standard of living\u2014all of which may potentially relate to nurses\u2019 job satisfaction\u2014should be investigated in future studies in China and in other countries of the world.",
