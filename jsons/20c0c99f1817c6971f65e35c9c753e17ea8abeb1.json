            "text": "TITIS MEDIA is a frequent diagnostic problem in daily 0 veterinary practice.' The diagnosis of middle ear disease may be difficult because clinical signs may be masked by otitis externa or confused with otitis interns.* However it is important to establish the diagnosis of otitis media since it should be managed surgically to avoid chronicity and irreversible hearing deficits. The value of physical examination is limited by anatomy but otoscopy may reveal discharge, foreign bodies, polyps or neopla~ia.~ Otitis media most commonly occurs across the tympanic membrane as a result of primary otitis externa. Other routes of involvement of the middle ear are either by hematogenous infection or the auditory tube.' The otoscopic observation of the tympanic membrane was long considered to be crucial for the diagnosis of middle ear disease4 and the presence of a ruptured tympanic membrane is a strong indicator for middle ear involvement. However otoscopy may be misleading since an intact tympanic membrane does not eliminate middle ear disease5. Radiography is useful in chronic infection but may be normal in early or mild infections. Therefore it is not regarded as a highly sensitive tool in the diagnosis of middle ear",

Cranial MR imaging was performed in three cats without clinical evidence of middle ear disease (cats 1-3) and in five with clinical or radiographic signs of otitis media (cats [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Images were obtained with a 2.3 T magnet* using a standard small animal coil. A proton density weighted turbo spin-echo pulse sequence with a repetition time (TR) of 1000 ms, an echo time (TE) of 13.6 ms, turbo factor (TF) of 8 and a single signal average was used as a localizer. The animals were sedated with ketamin and acepromacine and positioned in dorsal recumbency. T2-weighted images were acquired using a turbo spin-echo sequence at a TR of 4000 ms, TE of 30 ms, TF of 4 and 2 averages. T1-weighted spin echo (SE) images were acquired at a TR of 400 ms, TE of 15 ms, TF 1 and also 2 averages before and after administration of 0.2 mmolkg gadolinium-DPTA.? The slice thickness was 3 mm. The MR images were acquired in dorsal, saggital and transversal planes. The five diseased cats subsequently underwent ventral bulla osteotomy. In each cat tissue and fluid within the bulla tympanica was obtained and submitted for cytologic and histologic examination, as well as for culturing. The MR images of these five cats were analyzed qualitatively, compared to the three supposedly normal cats and to the MR imaging appearance of the middle ear in humans with otitis media.",

Otoscopically there was a small red mass covered with tenacious discharge in the horizontal portion of the left ear canal. There was hyperglobinemia (total protein: 9.27 g/dl, albumin: 3.9 g/dl). Serologic testing was negative for FeLV and positive for FIV. Coronavirus titers were within normal limits (<1:400). On radiographs the bony wall of the left tympanic bulla was thickened. MR imaging was performed to characterize the mass in the left ear canal and evaluate its extent.

In skull radiographs the bullae appeared normal. MR imaging was performed to evaluate the extent of the nasopharyngeal polyp. A mass with a size of 3.5 x 1.5 cm was identified in the nasopharynx. On T2 weighted images the mass was inhomogenous. It was capsulated, isointense to muscle (Tl) and had an inhomogenous and hypointense center.

Therefore comparison between the affected and unaffected side was possible with the normal side serving as a reference. Filling of the bulla tympanica with fluid or a mass was the most reliable MR finding. The obstructed compartment could be clearly identified with all sequences. In humans, mucosal swelling of the paranasal sinuses is a frequent finding. It is characterized by a thickening and visualization mucosal lining of the paranasal cavities. The signal intensity of the thickened mucosa is high on T2-weighted and intermediate on T 1 -weighted images with marked enhancement following administration of intravenous contrast medium.13 In our study, however, we could not differentiate mucosal swelling from fluid retention on the basis of T2-weighted images. We speculate that the small size of the external auditory canal may have resulted in our inability to differentiate between mucosa and fluid retention on TZweighted images owing to partial volume effects. Contrast enhancement was observed in an inflammatory polyp and in thickened mucosa (cat 7). Contrast enhancement allowed these entities to be differentiated from mucus. In the two cats with inflammatory polyps, the uptake of contrast medium was especially strong. The only malignant tumor in our series, the melanoma, did not have accumulation of contrast medium.
