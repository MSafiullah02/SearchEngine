Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged in 2002 and 2003, while Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged 10 years later [1] . In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China [2] , subsequently called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3] . SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease Coronaviruses predominantly cause respiratory tract infections in humans [1] . Specifically, the main symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported as fever, cough and shortness of breath [5] , with a less abrupt onset of symptoms compared to SARS [6, 7] . Data are still emerging regarding the epidemiology of COVID-19, though initial reports estimate a transmission rate (basic reproduction number, R0) of 2.2 [8] and a case fatality rate that increases among older adults [9] . Given the current pandemic, there is an urgent need to identify effective, safe treatments for COVID-19. Two such proposed treatments are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are well-established medications predominantly used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In vitro studies have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are effective at inhibiting SARS-Cov-2 infection, with the latter appearing to have more potent antiviral activity [10, 11] . Thus, repositioning of these drugs as antiviral therapies for COVID-19 is of global interest, however clinical data are limited and inconclusive.",

Cardiac toxicity is of particular importance for COVID-19 patients. Both potentially the disease itself and anticipated treatment strategies with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine pose significant risk of cardiac arrhythmias [21] . Short term use, as expected for the treatment of COVID-19, is likely to pose a lower risk of cardiac toxicity, nevertheless the risk cannot be overlooked as patients are expected to be on higher doses, possibly concomitantly taking other QT prolonging agents, in addition to having a potentially elevated risk due to the disease itself.",

Both duration of use and weight-based dosing (dose per kg) are important parameters for the risk of developing retinopathy [26] . The risk of retinal damage over a short time period may be negligible even with high doses [25] . However, given the seriousness of the outcome we have identified this as a key risk in the benefit-risk framework.

No significant difference in viral clearance was observed between the hydroxychloroquine group (0.87) and the comparator group (0.93; RD=-0.07, 95% CI: -0.75, 0.61). Median time to clearance was comparable between the two groups (Hydroxychloroquine: 4 days (range 1-9 days), Comparator: 2 days (range 1-4 days); p>0.05).Huang M and colleagues[20] examined virological clearance (by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR) on day 14 post randomisation. Ten patients were treated with chloroquine and 12 patients were treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (comparator group), which is a recommended treatment for COVID-19 in China. No significant difference in viral clearance was observed between the chloroquine group (1.00) and the comparator group (0.92; RD=0.08, 95% CI: -0.74, 0.91).",
