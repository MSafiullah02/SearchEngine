A rouleaugenic agent (e.g. polymerized blood albumin) is equally active in aggregating red blood cells from animal species A or from animal species B. The aggregates appear asrouleaux, or \"piles of coins.\" When the two cell populations are mixed and then treated with the rouleaugenic agent, each of the resulting rouleaux should either contain both A and B red cells (indicating non-specific aggregation), or all A and all B red cells (indicating specific aggregation). The latter alternative is found experimentally Thus, the entropy-driven aggregation shows specificity -\"like\" aggregating with \"like.\" In mixtures, red cells form homoaggregates (like with like) , not heteroaggregates (like with unlike). This reflects a general tendency for shared regularities in structure, and shared molecular vibrations (resonances), to promote self-self interactions between particulate entities, be they whole cells, or discrete macromolecules (see Chapter 2) .",

This would tend to counteract any tendency to maximize specific activity because the number of molecules present would suffice for the necessary level of activity, and there would be no selection pressure for them to improve on a per-molecule basis. The steady-state concentration of a protein is determined by evolutionary forces acting on parts of the corresponding gene (i.e . base mutations) to affect factors such as mRNA transcription rate, and mRNA and protein stabilities . For example, a mutation that decreases the transcription rate of a gene decreases the concentration of the corresponding mRNA, and hence the concentration of the protein that is made by translating that mRNA. A protein within the cell ends up with a certain specific activity, which can be less than the maximum possible. Over evolutionary time, the concentration of the protein is fine-tuned to the concentrations of its fellow travellers -the other diffusible proteins with which, from generation to generation, it has shared a common cytosol.

Like other exiled cells, discarded male gametes usually die. Whereas self-discharge of gametes (like menstruation) may have been rare in primitive communities, in modern communities (like other forms of contraception) it is the norm. Yet, over evolutionary time, the shaping of our sexual biology has been mainly influenced by the norms of primitive communities.

For example, flower color can depend on the rate of conversion of a colorless substrate to a colored pigment product. This rate would be progressively increased by increasing the concentration of an enzyme (gene product) that catalyzes the conversion. If the concentration of gene product is directly related to the number of active gene copies (as often occurs), then the X-axis can be seen as providing an index of gene dosage (i.e. gene copy number). The phenotypic parameter (measured color) increases with gene product concentration until point A when some other factor (e.g. substrate availability) becomes rate-limiting. The curve then plateaus. Increasing the amount of gene product (enzyme) now makes no difference to the colour of the flower (i.e. there is no change in the value of Y).",

Immunologists also tend not to recognize the implications of the crowded cytosol for molecular interactions.

Intracellular pathogens must fine-tune the concentrations of their own proteins to the solubility limits so imposed. Aggregates between viral proteins and normal host , antibody-like, \"immune receptor\" proteins, provide a possible basis for intracellular self/not-self discrimination at the protein level. Molecular chaperones, including heat-shock proteins, modulate this process. In such terms, we can explain Goldschmidt's phenocopy phenomenon, and paraneoplastic diseases. During their development there is positive selection of host lymphocytes reactive with \"near-self' antigens (positive repertoire selection)",
