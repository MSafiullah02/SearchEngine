Other emerging infectious diseases with local outbreaks include measles (since 2010), pandemic influenza caused by H1N1 (Swine flu) in 2009 and by H1N1 or H3N2 in 1996, cholera (2008-2010), and Chikyngunya (since 2013).7, 8 According to WHO (http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/), 1 billion people across 149 countries are affected by neglected tropical diseases.

Statin use has been associated with a reduced incidence of uveitis15; statins reportedly possessed anti-inflammatory effect16 and reduced the use of oral steroids in inflammatory bowel disease patients study.17 Most recently, patients prescribed with artesunate-amodiaquine for malaria reportedly had a lower mortality rate by EVD than those not prescribed with this regimen, suggesting that artesunate and amodiaquine warrant further investigation for their therapeutic benefit for treating EVD.18 A mining of EHRs identified terbutaline (approved for treating asthma) as a candidate for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,19 which was supported by in vivo effects in zebrafish.

We computationally showed that the pharmacological targets of more than 200 drugs associated with treatment-related neuropathy were linked, via protein-protein interactions, to a very small list of statistically significant transcription factors,23 which laid the foundation for our latter work on computing signaling pathways of drugs from drug targets to differentially perturbed genes. We were able to link drug-induced, differentially expressed genes to drug targets by using integer linear programming across prior knowledge of protein interaction networks and transcription factors.24 Drug targets are proteins; there is a critical need for using transcription factors as linkers to establish computational connectivity between mRNAs and intracellular, biological protein networks in the context of understanding the effects of drugs.",

            "text": "Another worthwhile pharmacodynamics database is a community-consensus database specifically for tackling infectious diseases including neglected tropic diseases. Infectious diseases share a common feature that virus use to gain entry into a host cell via a specific protein; host cell proteins or function are then used by virus for replication and subsequent infection. Therefore, there are 2 paths to tackle viral diseases, one is targeting viral enzymes and the other is targeting human functions required for viral entry and replication.30 These host cells' proteins are the primary targets for control and treatment of infection. To illustrate the usefulness of such a database, Zika virus disease is discussed herein. Zika virus disease is an emerging public health issue because it has been associated with microcephaly of newborns, premature births, blindness of newborns, neurological disorders in the elderly or vulnerable populations, and it can be transmitted via mosquitoes bite or sexually. Entry of Zika virus into human cells is mainly mediated by dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, Tyro3 protein tyrosine kinase.31 These proteins are also the receptors of other flavivirus for entry into human cells.32 TYRO3, protein tyrosine kinase, is also a human protein for entry of Ebola and Marburg viruses; (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene). TYRO3 is abundant in the brain. In rat brains, TYRO3 is widely expressed throughout the development stages after birth compared to AXL; and these receptor tyrosine kinases play a key role in the maturation and development of the central nervous system,33 thereby constituting potential targets to battle Zika virus. A database and knowledge base of pharmacodynamics across all approved drugs with individual antiviral potency will be the foundation for conducting systems pharmacology analysis, as well as for constructing systems pharmacology framework and models to battle infectious diseases such as Zika virus disease.",

As illustrated in Figure 3\n, systems pharmacology modeling is a translational tool that is constructed by design to capture information transmission across select levels of human body hierarchy; in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamics data are critically needed to enable translational information transmission via systems pharmacology modeling for drug repurposing. Clinical markers measured during treatment either from published clinical trials or from EHRs can be incorporated into the pharmacodynamics database so that systems pharmacology approaches can meaningfully infer drug and disease interactions and model reversal of disease biology.",

Emerging infectious diseases and neglected tropic diseases are no longer local health issues and should be preemptively controlled before they spread globally. The availability of big data ranging from omics to readouts of imaging and biochemical phenotypes, clinical laboratory and phenotypic profiles of individual natural diseases, and medical records of population responses to prescribed treatment regimens across ethic groups presents a new opportunity at the frontier of drug repurposing. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells, specific organ cell types derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, and cancer stem cells are being actively investigated and used in life science research. High-throughput screening technologies are being applied to facilitate the use of these cells for screening of new chemical entities and for fingerprinting individual marketed drugs to decipher the pharmacological network of a drug in the context of human biology. Our ability to discover the mode of action of an approved drug from the systems pharmacology perspective is increasing at a fast pace with advances in informatics and omics technologies (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics). So is our ability to use big data with informatics technologies. What is needed is a database that translates the action of drugs at the molecular level to the response phenotypes observed either in 2-D or 3-D cell culture constructs or animals or humans. A database of pharmacodynamics in connection to clinical markers and end points in the context of human biology will aid the use of systems pharmacology methods to facilitate drug repurposing in the wake of global health burden and to improve global well-being. A pharmacodynamics database dedicated to neglected tropic diseases will benefit as well as improve global economy and well-being.",

In vitro/preclinical pharmacodynamic/phenotypic measures transmit the information of molecular-level and cell community-level interactions and reveal interactions between a drug and a human body at the subject level. In the target disease population, pharmacodynamics reflects the repurposed therapeutic effects of a drug and associated population variability.
