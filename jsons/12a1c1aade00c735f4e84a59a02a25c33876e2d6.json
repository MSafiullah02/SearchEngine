MERS-CoV leads to death in one-third of cases and SARS-CoV in one-tenth; for SARS-CoV-2, reports indicate rates between 2% and 11% in confirmed cases. 1,3 Notably, testing has been restricted to hospitalised patients in many territories. The basic reproduction number or new cases caused by one infected person characterises the virus spread (R 0 = R nought). 5 If R 0 <1, the transmission is likely to stop. If R 0 >1, there is a high risk of epidemic spread if there is not timely and effective containment. Although MERS-CoV has not been contained, it is currently controlled, due to R 0 ~1. In contrast, SARS-CoV had an R 0 ~4, and reached 29 countries and a total of 8,096 cases, with the last cases reported in May 2004. 6 The reported R 0 for SARS-CoV-2 is ~3; however, its current spread may indicate this to be higher. 7,8 Importantly, the fact that infected individuals could become contagious before developing symptoms may augment R 0 . Despite diverse societal measures to avoid the spread of SARS-CoV-2, such as social distancing, self-isolation, quarantines, curfews and total lockdowns, which limit spread significantly, its control seems yet remote. With the number of COVID-19 patients increasing exponentially, and a significant minority requiring hospitalisation and intensive care support, 4 hospitals have massively reallocated resources to the pandemic, reduced elective care activities and limited the availability of investigators and research personnel to continue activities for ongoing clinical trials. Moreover, coordinating centres and sponsors in affected countries have shifted to home-based organisations, requiring adaption of operations to the current crisis. In addition, participants in clinical Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and by 24 April 2020, it had affected >2.73 million people in 185 countries and caused >192,000 deaths. Despite diverse societal measures to reduce transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, such as implementing social distancing, quarantine, curfews and total lockdowns, its control remains challenging. Healthcare practitioners are at the frontline of defence against the virus, with increasing institutional and governmental supports. Nevertheless, new or ongoing clinical trials, not related to the disease itself, remain important for the development of new therapies, and require interactions among patients, clinicians and research personnel, which is challenging, given isolation measures.

Complete, consistent and accurate data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneously recorded, original or a true copy and accurate (ALCOA).\" 16 Data are to be recorded exactly as intended, and when retrieved at a later time, should be the same as originally recorded.

Follow-up visits should be performed via telehealth when possible. Extension of follow-up periods may be required to facilitate complete data collection.

When adjusting visits or study procedures, the patient perspective must be captured. More specifically, participants may need to re-consent after being informed of the changes with the explicit possibility of stopping participation. Notwithstanding, participants should not visit investigational sites for the purpose of re-consenting. An alternative approach is a video call supplemented with a confirmatory email.11 Drug trials add the complexity of drug supply and the need to maintain blinding. Consideration should be given to shipping drugs directly to homes from the investigational sites, ensuring that transportation and storage conditions are appropriate. Drug accountability and compliance should be monitored.9,11,13,14 General medical practices, emergency departments and intensive care or pulmonary units are most exposed to direct contact with known COVID-19 patients. An excessive workload is also evident in imaging, laboratory and pharmacy departments, as well as other departments supporting the care of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, generally elderly people with accompanying comorbidities. Healthcare professionals from every discipline have been called upon to fight the pandemic, including retired professionals and those who have just completed formal education.
