The pandemic blurs the micro, cross-domain boundaries that shape day-to-day work behaviors. As COVID-19 has spurred the adoption of remote work (Duffy, 2020), many individuals work from home while attending to various non-work demands (e.g., assisting children's home-based learning, running errands for the elderly family members who are advised to stay home at all times). These changes are likely to affect individuals' work and career outcomes in different ways.",

The COVID-19 has led to national border closures and travel restrictions across the globe (Salcedo, Yar, & Cherelus, 2020). Several lines of research emphasize that the tightened national borders should be an important consideration for work and vocational behavior research. First, data suggest that a large number of individuals search for work and career opportunities outside their home country (International Labour Organization, 2015). The tighter national borders thwart individuals' plans for transnational and global career. Indeed, many companies have canceled or postponed international talent recruitment amid the global virus outbreak (Gaskell, 2020). Similarly, many universities have suspended international exchange programs while recalling students who were studying abroad (Redden, 2020). These changes may have subsequent ripple effects because there is a sizeable workforce in the global talent management and international education industries (e.g., international talent recruiting services, marketing and accommodation services for international education).",

Given the chaotic and uncertain nature of the pandemic, many negative consequences, ranging from short-term (e.g., reduced work productivity) to long-term (e.g., a downward career trajectory), are expected. Further, whether and why such harmful impact on work and careers differs depending on individuals' non-work circumstances merits attention. For instance, blurred role boundaries are likely to be disruptive for workers with family demands more so than those without. Research should also explore positive outcomes; while the negative outcomes are logical given the situation, some people may reap benefits from the adversity. The extreme blend of work and family, for instance, may push more people to learn how to create and negotiate role boundaries or how to maintain daily productivity despite frequent interruptions.",

While it is undeniable that the pandemic situation is beyond one's control, it is still important to recognize and identify what one can do for optimal work and career outcomes. Individual initiatives to amend the micro boundaries is one such example. Encouraged (or forced) by the situation, people may revisit their assumptions and preferences about role boundaries and change their boundary management styles and tactics. Given that support from other members of role domains is pivotal, another interesting question is how dual-earner couples create rules and negotiate their work and family involvement. When members of a dual-earner couple are working from home while taking care of dependents, what are some factors that explain their relative resource allocation (e.g., income, workplace flexibility, gender ideology, etc.)? A related question concerns work-, relationship-, and health-related consequences of the (un)satisfactory boundary amendment. Concerning the macro boundary, an interesting question is what individuals do to minimize the disruptive impact of closed borders on their work, career, and family. Would they change their career plans, and if so, what factors shape such changes? Answers to these questions can help individuals to adapt adequately to the macro boundary changes.",

Alternatively, research may identify a novel type of support that is effective in such unusual circumstances.
