Such narratives tend to exert mostly negative impacts on how individuals deal with the pandemic. Hence, it is crucial to be able to deal effectively with the adverse effects of such narratives on public health preparedness. For instance, there are rumors that this is a \u201cnormal\u201d flu, as Turkmenistan and Tajikistan asked their citizens to continue working after calling the virus and its treatment \u201cbogus\u201d (I. Ali, unpublished data, 2020).9 These rumors would exert adverse impacts in the form of people\u2019s negligence and easiness about the virus. Their lack of attention to the virus would hinder the processes of containment. The virus may remain asymptomatic in many cases without developing any severe consequences, but these asymptomatic people can transfer the virus to other people, who may be among the \u201cat-risk\u201d groups, such as older people.11 This way, the virus would continue spreading, causing more burden on the health-care systems, and influencing the preparedness, not at a country level, but at the global level, because the world is highly interconnected.",

Disinformation, rumors, and conspiracy theories must be countered with easy access to correct and helpful information. Simultaneously, it is indispensable that these stakeholders, chiefly health-care providers, epidemiologists, and medical anthropologists, should be greatly prepared in advance for any potential second wave to diagnose cases and offer the required treatment; otherwise, we will have to end up acknowledging that \u201chistory repeats itself.\u201d",
