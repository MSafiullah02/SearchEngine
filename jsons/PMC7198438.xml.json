This case provides ideal samples with little interference to study coronavirus epidemiology, considering that the infected origin is known, the number of susceptible individuals is constant and the prevention and control work are timely deployed after the first case is confirmed. A modeling analysis of the spread on the \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d identifies a more reasonable spread of the disease and further provides implications for global, national and regional control and prevention measures.",

Typical methods include regression [2] and compartmental models such as SIR (susceptible, infected and recovered) [3] and its variants are frequently used to model disease spread, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [4], [5], [6] and COVID-19 [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. However, these models assume that epidemics transmit in a homogeneous population, i.e., new infectees are from the group of susceptible individuals who can be infected with the same transmission probability. This assumption is far from the social contact patterns, especially when population structure is a spatial-temporal variant with quarantine, and socioeconomic activities [13]. Therefore, a more reasonable epidemic model considers social contact patterns.",

To more efficiently estimate the transmission rate, it is urgent to define new statistics, such as a data-driven rate that is easy to obtain [20] and a time-dependent rate [21]. The average transmissibility, however, denotes the mean probability of disease transmission among individuals and is free of the population; therefore, it is theoretically robust to benefit the public health strategy decision making.",

An investigation from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan reported that 65 crews and 466 passengers were infected on 18 February [24]. The corresponding infection rates for crews and passengers were \u03b11=12.24% and \u03b12=87.76%, respectively. Assuming these rates are constant, the infected passengers and crew were 619 (sum of P1 and P2b) and 86 (sum of C1 and C2a) until 19 February, respectively.",

(1) implies that the average transmissibility t, the infected period ip, and the average degree K have notable impacts on R0. By providing personal protective equipment and cutting down the close contact among individuals, both t and K are reduced and so is R0. We further model the unprotected contact scenario for one month, and R0 ranges from 6.94 to 11.20 when the infected period is from 15 to 31, while t remains at 0.026. This proves that the average transmissibility is more stable, and reasonable judgement can be derived by turning to t.",

Compared with protected contact, the airborne spread test is implemented in a larger population. However, its epidemic curves with or without quarantine are closer (data deviations of protected contact and airborne spread tests are 14.46% and 0.36%, respectively). We believe this difference is mainly attributed to incorrect control work, i.e., isolation works well in managing transmission in social contact scenarios; however, when a virus is transmitted via air, isolation may not be sufficient. Inspired by the NCSI Eq. (2), a better approach is to disperse the crowds and/or ventilate the closed spaces, which can dilute the virus concentration in air. It further provides the correct information that air exchanges are vital for the prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks in the closed special settings, such as hospitals, malls, and mass gathering activities.",

Considering the unprotected and protected contact tests, both R0 and t decrease when quarantine is implemented, which proves that personal protective materials such as coveralls, masks, and eye covers are useful for infection prevention. We further notice that R0 in the unprotected contact test is much larger than 2.5, which was provided by the WHO report. This implies that if the intensive unprotected contact pattern is maintained for a couple of days, the epidemic curve may climb dramatically. As shown in the protected contact test, R0 falls far below 2.5. However, this tiny R0 does not represent the true basic reproductive number when using protective materials; we are inclined to assume that protective measures are not fully implemented and some crews were exposed. This highlights that high-risk populations such as medical staff or healthcare workers, should rigorously practice prevention measures during epidemics.",

The corresponding epidemic models are mainly based on contact networks, in which parameter estimation is performed with Bayesian inference and MH sampling. Considering that the daily confirmed case reports lag far behind the situation of disease spread, reconstruction is useful for understanding the true transmission dynamics. The results reveal that during early intensive social contacts, R0 is 6.94, triple that reported by the WHO for China. If no quarantine is implemented, the population will be infected in one month. The decreasing R0 indicates that following control and prevention measures manage the outbreak. Considering the ongoing outbreaks in many other cruise ships all over the world, this study provides a scientific reference and the practical prevention measures for the similar closed settings.",
