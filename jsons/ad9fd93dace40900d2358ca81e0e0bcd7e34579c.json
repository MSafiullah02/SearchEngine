This pandemic poses unprecedented stress on the health care system including programs performing allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapy such as with CAR T cells. Risk factors for severe disease include age and predisposing conditions such as cancer. The true impact on stem cell transplant and CAR T-cell recipients in unknown. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) has therefore developed recommendations for transplant programs and physicians caring for these patients. These guidelines were developed by experts from the Infectious Diseases Working Party and have been endorsed by EBMT's scientific council and board. This work intends to provide guidelines for transplant centers, management of transplant candidates and recipients, and donor issues until the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.",

The outbreak started in Wuhan in China and was initially mainly concentrated in Asia with a few import cases to other parts of the world. Next, a large number of cases started to appear in northern Italy. Thereafter, the outbreak has spread to Iran, all European countries, to North America, and the rest of the world. The WHO classified COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11. The pressure on health care systems is very high in all countries affected and increasing numbers of infected health care staff are being reported. Many European countries have imposed major restrictions on meetings, travel, and everyday life. This is likely to impact greatly on the HCT and CAR T activity in Europe as in many other parts of the world throughout 2020, and potentially beyond.",

In addition, the IDWP started collecting patient reports through the mechanism of the EBMT registry to rapidly collect information about outcome of autologous and allogeneic HCT patients developing COVID- 19 . The EBMT has also started educational activities directed to physicians, patients, and care givers through webinars. Five weekly updates of the recommendations have now been distributed and the current status is summarized in this paper.",

Symptoms vary from no or very mild symptoms of an upper respiratory infection to very severe resulting in the need for intensive care and death from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). It is becoming increasingly clear that asymptomatic or very mildly symptomatic individuals are important for the rapid spread of the infection in the population. The risks both for infections and for severe disease seem to be lower in children. Increasing age and the presence of comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and pulmonary disease, are reported risk factors for severe disease and mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Patients, who develop more severe symptoms including respiratory failure, often progress during the 2nd week after the start of symptoms and it is believed that this is to a great extent due to an immune reaction in the lower airways. Whether patients, who are immunosuppressed develop a different form of disease is currently unclear although some preliminary information from early cases indicate that such can be the case. Health care workers are also at risk for contracting COVID-19 [7] .",

The decision has to be made based on individual considerations taking into account the risk of the patient associated with on one hand the delay of the procedure and on the other proceeding with conditioning. In general, however, if a transplant candidate is diagnosed with COVID-19 a deferral of at least 3 months is advisable, in accordance with ECDC recommendations. However, this is not always possible due to the risk for progression of the underlying disease. This might be particularly pertinent for patients waiting for CAR T-cell therapy since this is frequently performed on patients refractory for other therapies and therefore being at a very high risk for progress of the underlying disease Therefore, in patients with high risk disease, stem cell transplantation should be deferred until the patient is asymptomatic and has two negative virus PCR swabs taken at least 24 h apart. Deferral of 14 days is a minimum but should preferably be 21 days and a new PCR is recommended before the start of conditioning.

Therapy should be given in close collaboration with specialists in infectious diseases. Despite FDA approval of remdesivir, it is still unclear if and when it optimally should be used. Later in the course of the infection antiinflammatory therapy with corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab has been shown to be of value in non-transplant patients. Supportive care is crucial including non-invasive ventilation and anti-coagulants to prevent thromboembolic complications, which can be frequent and severe in patients with COVID. Treatment of viral, bacterial and fungal copathogens should be optimized. It is currently recommended that immunosuppressive prophylaxis/treatment is continued since there is no data supporting reducing immunosuppression and it might instead cause harm.",

Although WHO and other international and national authorities have warned for the possibility of a new pandemic caused most likely by a viral pathogen such as SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, a new influenza strain, or possibly a hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola or Lassa, the health care systems were caught unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, enormous activity has started from the beginning of the outbreak in China to learn more about the virus and the disease and to disseminate this knowledge across the world, Since the virus is new to the human population, it is likely that before long-term virus control is achieved a large proportion of the population will have to either have experienced the viral infection or have been vaccinated. Therefore, continued international collaboration is necessary to increase our knowledge and thereby decrease the risk for harm to the very vulnerable group of patients either waiting for or having undergone the potentially life-saving procedure of HCT or cellular therapy. Scientific organizations such as the EBMT has a responsibility to the community to help gather and disseminate information including collecting cases of COVID-19 through its well established registry and also to actively participate in educational activities directed to all stakeholders in the transplant and cellular therapy activities.",
