The decision to perform virological screening was at the discretion of the attending physician. The institutional review board of the Clermont Ferrand teaching hospital approved this retrospective observational study and waived the need for informed consent. Acute respiratory failure was defined as a respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute or respiratory distress symptoms or PaO 2 on room air lower than 60 mmHg or a need for ventilatory support. Patients underwent noninvasive tests to look for infections, including non-induced sputum examination for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi; blood cultures; and urine tests for bacterial antigens. Whenever possible, patients did not received antibiotics before sampling for bacterial culture. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed when deemed appropriate by the attending physician. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected as described previously [Azoulay et al., 2008] and was used for bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal cultures; detection of RVs antigen by immunofluorescence (IF); and cytological examination. Echocardiography, chest computed tomography, and thoracocentesis were also performed when deemed appropriate by the attending physician. IF (Argene, Verniolle, France) was performed routinely to test nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, and 3; and adenoviruses. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was sought starting in October 2007. All specimens were then stored frozen at minus 80\u02daC until processing for multiplex molecular assay at the end of inclusion period. Total nucleic acids were purified from 200 ml of respiratory specimens by using the EasyMag System (Biom\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) and eluted in a final volume of 100 ml. Molecular investigation for RVs was carried out using the multiplex molecular assay, Respi-Finder19 (Pathofinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands), that detects and differentiates 14 RVs including influenza viruses A and B; PIV-1 to PIV-4; RSV A and B; rhinovirus; human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, and NL63; hMPV; and adenovirus. Additionally, this multiplex molecular assay detected influenza A H5N1 and four bacteria (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis).",

The multiplex molecular assay had a higher sensitivity than IF staining, accordingly to previous studies [Liolios et al., 2001; van Elden et al., 2002; Legoff et al., 2005; Reijans et al., 2008] . The seemingly higher prevalence of RVs compared to previous reports [Carrat et al., 2006; Daubin et al., 2006 ] may be due in part to the high sensitivity of multiplex molecular assay, but also to specific characteristics of our study population. In this cohort, patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were more prone to viral infection compared to the other patients. Respiratory viruses were the only microbial documentation in most cases. We believe this clearly emphasizes the major role of RVs as a trigger of exacerbations in patients with chronic underlying respiratory conditions [Couch et al., 1997; Lieberman et al., 2002; Sethi, 2011] . However, the present results do not allow any firm conclusion regarding the exact significance of RVs detection by molecular screening during acute respiratory failure. The detection of RVs by molecular assay alone has been associated with lower virus titers and with fewer reported respiratory symptoms compared to Results are from the univariate analysis. Respiratory viruses isolated in patients with chronic obstructive respiratory diseases were: influenza A in 9 and B in 2; RSV in 3; hMPV in 4; adenovirus in 1; rhinovirus in 4; coronavirus NL63 in 1; coronavirus OC43 in 1; and coronavirus 229E in 1. One patient had a viral dual infection with influenza B and rhinovirus. Respiratory viruses isolated in patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: influenza A in 1; RSV in 1; PIV 3 in 1; rhinovirus in 1; and coronavirus NL63 in 1. One patient had a dual viral infection with PIV3 and rhinovirus. Respiratory viruses isolated in patients with non-infectious lung diseases were: influenza A in 1; adenovirus in 2; rhinovirus in 1; coronavirus NL63 in 1. concomitant detection by both molecular assay and conventional methods [Jansen et al., 2011] . It suggests that molecular methods may allow the detection of mildly symptomatic stages of RVs infections or even asymptomatic viral shedding. Thus, we cannot exclude that some of our patients exhibited asymptomatic viral shedding concomitant with respiratory failure of any other etiology. Finally, more than one third of the study patients were infected by influenza viruses most of which were missed by IF assay. First, this underlines the role of influenza in severe exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma and thus the critical importance to promote vaccination in these population. Second, these results support the need for a rapid influenza diagnosis to ensure proper infection control measures. This study reports lower mortality rates in patients with positive multiplex molecular assay compared to those with negative assays. This apparent better prognosis of virus-associated respiratory disorders, as described in the study by Daubin et al. [2006] , likely reflects the better prognosis of acute exacerbations of chronic respiratory conditions compared to the other etiologies of acute respiratory failure.",

In these patients, a positive molecular assay may give a plausible etiology for the acute respiratory failure event thus allowing to stop antibiotics in patients with negative bacterial investigation or even to withhold antibiotics in those with no clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia. The short delay about a few hours to render results of multiplex molecular assay could help clinicians to move toward this objective. However, intensivists may be reluctant to stop antibiotics in the settings of acute respiratory failure and the impact of molecular testing for RVs on antibiotics consumption deserves further investigation.",

In particular, the selection process of our study patients may have introduced a major bias. On one hand, attending physician may have been more prone to perform virological assays in patients at higher probability of RVs infection (i.e., contact with infected people or flu-like syndrome). On the other hand, they may have excluded patients with well-defined etiology for acute respiratory failure thus missing potential concomitant RVs infections. The net effect of this on the observed RVs infection frequency will remain difficult to determine and hampers the interpretation of the present results. This study demonstrates the high diagnostic yield for virus detection using a single multiplex molecular assay in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with acute respiratory failure, and especially those with acute exacerbation of obstructive respiratory diseases. This diagnostic tool providing results in a few hours allows to reconsider RVs detection as part of the etiologic investigations in patients with acute respiratory failure, especially for those with acute exacerbations of asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether a rapid diagnosis translates into clinical benefit with reduced antibiotics and more appropriate and cost-effectiveness care deserves further investigation.",
