The PCB concept was developed during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) crisis in 2003, when many healthcare providers were exposed to SARS-CoV, resulting in several deaths. The PCB shifts the mentality away from patient outcome and puts healthcare provider safety front and centre.1 The decision to initiate a PCB is based on suspected or confirmed presence of a novel respiratory illness. If a reliable history of this cannot be obtained, PCB should be initiated. In the setting of significant community burden of disease, the decision to treat all cardiac arrests as protected should be considered.",

Only one study found an increased odds of infection (Liu et al. 2009), but chest compressions were performed in conjunction with intubation; thus, it is unclear whether the increased risk of infection is attributable to performing chest compressions, airway management, or a combination of the two.4 Defibrillation alone was not associated with increased risk of healthcare provider infection.4",

A high flow non-rebreather O2 mask with a HEPA filter can be considered to enable passive oxygenation; however, care should be taken to turn off the O2 flow prior to intubation. Bag-valve-mask ventilation is problematic in a PCB, as it is an aerosolizing procedure, and it can be difficult to maintain an adequate seal during a cardiac arrest. Intubation should be performed by the most experienced operator optimized for first-pass success. Video laryngoscopy is suggested as the preferred modality, as it allows the operator to increase distance from the patient's head. Chest compressions should be held while intubation is performed until the endotracheal tube placement is confirmed and closed circuit is established. Insertion of a supraglottic airway with an attached filter is preferred to bag valve mask ventilation as a rescue manoeuvre in the event of a difficult intubation.",
