An opinion piece in Annals of Internal Medicine justifies the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approach, which is considerably less stringent than the UK guidelines in terms of PPE.3 It is certainly true that you can be wearing all the PPE in the world but if you put in on incorrectly, don't take care of it during use, or remove it carelessly you will put yourself at risk, as outlined in another Annals of Internal Medicine article.4 There's also some discussion on experimental Ebola drugs, principally the monoclonal antibody-based ZMapp.5, 6 How do we investigate efficacy, benefit, and harm in a turbulent outbreak setting? Animal models are one route, and a Nature study of ZMapp shows a lot of promise.7 Also regarding pandemic viruses, a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine evaluates domestic transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).8 Probable transmission of MERS-CoV occurred to only 4% of 280 household contacts. However, looking at this another way, probable transmission to household contacts occurred on 12 occasions from just 26 cases!",

            "text": "Several useful environmental science updates are published this month. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology publishes a model comparing the relative contribution of contaminated hands versus surfaces to the transmission of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms.9 The model simulating transmission in a 20-bed intensive care unit (ICU) found that improvements in hand hygiene compliance are about twice as effective in preventing the transmission of MDR A. baumannii, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or vancomycin-resistant enterococci compared with improvements in environmental hygiene, i.e. a 20% improvement in terminal cleaning is required to \u2018match\u2019 a 10% improvement in hand hygiene compliance. However, this is only applicable for rooms or, by extension, bed spaces, where the prior room occupant was infected or colonized by these pathogens. Meanwhile, a study in the American Journal of Infection Control found that many of the sites sampled, particularly around the bedspace, failed proposed microbiological standards (<2.5 cfu/cm2).10 The authors recommend reverting to previous, less stringent standards of <5 cfu/cm2. Or perhaps their cleaners should scrub harder? Finally, a number of technological solutions have emerged in recent years to augment conventional cleaning and disinfection methods. One option, reviewed in the Journal of Hospital Infection, is 405 nm light, which has the advantage of operability in occupied rooms and wards (unlike most \u201cno-touch\u201d systems).11 However, the \u2018pay-off\u2019 for this is a lower level of efficacy; will it be sufficient to reduce transmission?",

Lack of effective therapy for MDR Gram-negatives and the threat of pan-drug resistance is of great concern. A useful leader in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy concludes that colistin combination therapy is better than monotherapy for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negatives.13 Finally, chlorhexidine has shown promise in reducing the transmission of Gram-positive bacteria in the ICU, but a concerning study in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology identifies more reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine in bacteria isolated from units performing daily chlorhexidine gluconate bathing.14 The study also illustrates that Gram-negative bacteria tend to have less susceptibility to chlorhexidine than Gram-positive bacteria.",
