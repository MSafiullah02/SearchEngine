            "text": "This prospective clinical and virological study of 2,060 otherwise healthy children aged <15 years of age (1,112 males; mean age AE SD, 3.46 AE 3.30 years) who attended the Emergency Department of Milan University's Institute of Pediatrics because of an acute disease excluding trauma during the winter season 2003-2004 was designed to compare the prevalence and clinical importance of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) in children. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed HCoV infection in 79 cases (3.8%): 33 HCoV-229E (1.6%), 13 HCoV-NL63 (0.6%), 11 HCoV-OC43 (0.5%), none HCoV-HKU1 genotype A, and 22 (1.1%) co-detections of a HCoV and another respiratory virus. The HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper respiratory tract infection; there was no significant difference in clinical presentation between single HCoV infections and HCoV co-infections. Diagnostic methods were used in a limited number of patients, and the therapy prescribed and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of the viral strain. There were a few cases of other members of the households of HCoV-positive children falling ill during the 5-7 days following enrollment. These findings suggest that HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have a limited clinical and socioeconomic impact on otherwise healthy children and their household contacts, and the HCoV-NL63 identified recently does not seem to be any different. The quantitative and qualitative role of HCoV-HKU1 genotype A is apparently very marginal.",

            "text": "Although they have been recognized since the mid-1960s, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have received relatively little attention as human pathogens because the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 strains were considered mainly as the etiological agents of common cold and only occasionally as the cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in infants and immunocompromized hosts [Baker, 2004; Kahn and McIntosh, 2005; McIntosh, 2005] . However, their clinical importance has been re-evaluated following the identification of two apparently more virulent strains: one associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the NL63 strain (HCoV-NL63) [Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2004; van der Hoek et al., 2004; Esper et al., 2005] , which have been found in children with croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, particularly in the first months of life [Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Boivin et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Kaiser et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005; van der Hoek et al., 2005] . A novel HCoV (HCoV-HKU1) has also been detected in adults with pneumonia and children with lower respiratory tract infection [Woo et al., 2005; Sloots et al., 2006; Vabret et al., 2006] . However, there are few data comparing the prevalence and clinical importance of the different HCoVs, and the real pediatric impact of each needs to be established better.",

HCoV infection was significantly more frequent than infection due to hMPV (48 cases, 2.3%) and parainfluenza viruses (29 cases, 1.4%). Fifty seven (72.2%) of the 79 HCoV-positive cases were single HCoV infections: 33 (1.6%) due to HCoV-229E, 13 due to HCoV-NL63 (0.6%), and 11 due to HCoV-OC43 (0.5%); none of the study children was positive for HCoV-HKU1 genotype A. The remaining 22 children (1.1%) showed co-infection of a HCoV and another respiratory virus (Table II) , the most frequent association being HCoV and RSV infection. The frequency of the involvement of the three HCoV strains detected was similar: 40.9% HCoV-229E, 31.8% HCoV-NL63, and 27.3% HCoV-OC43. Two was the maximum number of detections per specimen. Table III shows the enrollment characteristics of the study children diagnosed as having HCoV infection. There was no significant difference in gender distribution, but the mean age of the children in the HCoV-229E and HCoV\u00feother respiratory viruses groups was significantly higher. The majority of the children (55.7%) had fever at enrollment but only few of them were diagnosed as patients with fever without source. HCoVs were mainly identified in children with respiratory tract infections (with upper respiratory tract infections being more common than lower respiratory tract infections), but a significant number of children in all of the groups were affected by gastrointestinal infections (defined as infectious diarrhea with or without vomit). There were no significant differences in clinical presentation between the individual HCoV strains, or between single HCoV infection and HCoV co-detections. Table IV summarizes the data concerning diagnostic methods at enrollment, therapeutic approaches, and clinical outcomes among the study children with demonstrated HCoV infection. Further diagnostic methods were used in a limited number of cases regardless of the HCoV strain or the presence of HCoV co-detections, and prescribed therapy and clinical outcome were similar in all four groups, with marginal rates of hospital admissions. Table V shows the socioeconomic impact of HCoV infections on the household contacts of the study children. In the 5-7 days following enrollment, household members suffered a limited number of diseases similar to those of the infected children, with a significantly higher frequency of illnesses among the households of HCoV-229E-and HCoV-OC43-positive children. In line with these findings, additional medical visits and antipyretic prescriptions were significantly more common among the households of the HCoV-229Eand HCoV-OC43-positive children than among those who were HCoV-NL63 positive or infected by HCoV and other respiratory viruses. There were no between-group differences in terms of antibiotic prescriptions or lost working days by mothers or fathers. The impact of the HCoV infection of the study children on household hospitalization rates seemed to be marginal: only one sibling of a child with HCoV and other respiratory viruses required hospital admission.",

Only 3.8% of the study population was infected by one of these viruses, and the importance of HCoVs in attendance to the Emergency Department was significantly less than that of other common respiratory viruses including influenza viruses, RSV, adenovirus, and rhinoviruses. As HCoVs are one of the main causes of the common cold and circulate widely during the winter [Baker, 2004; Kahn and McIntosh, 2005; McIntosh, 2005] , their low prevalence in this study population can be explained by their limited pathogenicity and the consequent fact that most infected children are treated by general practitioners rather than in hospitals.

Moreover, considering the peak age of HCoVs infection according to the HCoV literature [Bastien et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005] , also the low mean age of the children enrolled in this study may explain the low prevalence of HCoV infection. Furthermore, taking into account that classical HCoV infections are known to occur in 2-to 3-year epidemic cycles and scattered outbreaks [Kahn and McIntosh, 2005] , the study population could be from a season of low HCoV activity. Finally, despite their high sensitivity and specificity van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005] , the assays used in this study may not have detected all HCoV strains. HCoV-229E was detected more frequently than HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-NL63. In fact, the most striking difference between these and other recently published data [Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Kaiser et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005] is the marginal epidemiological and clinical importance of HCoV-NL63 in this study, despite the fact that it has been associated with croup [van der Hoek et al., 2005] , asthma exacerbation [Arden et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Ebihara et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2005] , febrile seizures, and high fever [Bastien et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005] leading to hospital admission as well as upper respiratory tract infection [Bastien et al., 2005; Boivin et al., 2005; Chiu et al., 2005; Esper et al., 2005] . In this prospective study of a large group of otherwise healthy children evaluated for acute diseases in the Emergency Department, HCoV-NL63 was mainly found in patients with mild diseases and its clinical impact was no different from that of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Only one child infected by HCoV-NL63 was admitted to hospital, and a similar number of children infected by the different HCoVs strains required laboratory, microbiological, and radiological diagnostic investigations.",

HCoV, coronavirus. (0) 3/32 ( Department. The demonstration of a marginal socioeconomic impact of the infected patients on their households confirm further the limited role of HCoVs. The recently identified HCoV-NL63 does not seem to be any different in terms of clinical or socioeconomic importance, and HCoV-HKU1 genotype A seems to play a marginal quantitative and qualitative role. Further community-based studies involving different countries and children with chronic underlying conditions should make it possible to determine the role of HCoVs more precisely, and identify the children in whom these viruses can lead to severe clinical problems.",
