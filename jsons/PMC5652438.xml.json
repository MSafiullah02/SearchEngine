An international scientific committee developed the program and invited 21 experts to discuss the full range of the conference themes. Eighty-five abstracts were submitted; 25 were presented orally, and 60 were displayed as posters. The conference presentations discussed transmission of a range of respiratory viruses, including transmission of influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, MERS coronavirus, and morbilliviruses. As an example of a respiratory pathogen about which modes of transmission and control are well understood, available data on transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were reviewed.",

Such cohort studies may allow defining of a \u201ccontagious phenotype.\u201d One theme of interest was the potential for deep sequencing data to permit estimation of the number of viral particles transmitted from one person to another (the transmission bottleneck) and how this bottleneck might vary for different reasons. Other discussions included the potential use of deep sequencing approaches to study virus evolution, viral fitness, and antiviral resistant mutations, as well as the role of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and environmental pollutants (e.g., PM2.5) on viral transmission. Social and ecologic factors examined included crowdedness (in human households, in dog shelters) and school holidays.",

There was particular interest in the use of experimental animal models for research on virus transmission, and data were provided on the advantages and disadvantages of different experimental animal models for influenza, RSV, morbilliviruses, and parainfluenza viruses. As an extension of previous work that identified the importance of influenza transmission through respiratory droplets in the ferret model (9), a new approach to analyze the particle sizes involved in transmission of influenza in this model was presented. Also discussed were novel imaging technologies and experimental models that allow simultaneous measurements of different viral and host parameters for pathogenesis and immunological studies in vivo.",

The International Society for Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Diseases (ISIRV) provided some logistical support for this conference; a potential development is the creation of a special interest group within ISIRV for conference participants and other researchers to discuss these shared interests.",
