The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is continuously posing a worldwide public health threat. Although the immunological susceptibility and response for the disease have not been determined yet, more insight is being gained regarding its prothrombotic state. Abnormal coagulation parameters have been observed, especially d-dimer levels, and has correlated with poorer prognosis among COVID 19 infected patients [2].",

Nevertheless, ARDS secondary to COVID 19 infection appears to represent a more complex scenario. Recently, there has been evidence for a possible role of empiric anticoagulation among infected individuals with marked elevation in the d-dimer level [3]. This observation has been related to hypercoagulability and possible pulmonary vasculature micro-thrombosis [3]. Klok et al. reported an increased incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID 19 infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) [4]. It has also been recently documented that a high number of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) have been diagnosed within 24 h of admissions [5]. This suggests that such events occur early on in the disease course and are not a complication of acute illness or prolonged hospitalization solely. Herein, we present six patients who were not in critical illness yet presented with pulmonary embolism on admission in association with COVID 19 infection. (Table 1\n, Fig. 1\n) This emphasizes a potential thrombotic state in those patients regardless of their pneumonia severity.",

A 12\u2011lead electrocardiogram (EKG) was remarkable for T wave inversions in the right precordial leads (V1 to V4). Complete blood count (CBC) performed was remarkable for leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia. Other laboratory analyses were remarkable for elevated d-dimer at 17 \u03bcg/mL (reference: \u22640.5 \u03bcg/mL), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 160 mg/L (reference: <10 mg/L), elevated troponin I at 0.5 ng/mL (reference: <0.030 ng/mL), and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 378 pg/mL (reference: \u2264100 pg/mL). The initial chest X-ray performed was unremarkable for any pulmonary infiltrates. As the patient remained hypoxemic on room air, a decision was made to proceed with Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) scan of the chest which was remarkable for multiple, extensive and occlusive pulmonary emboli bilaterally along with right heart strain. In addition, there were multi-lobar consolidations confirmed to be secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection later on the day of presentation. A 2D echocardiogram revealed a dilated right ventricle with interventricular septal flattening. She was treated with systemic thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) followed by therapeutic enoxaparin (1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily). In addition, she received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and was subsequently discharged on Apixaban after a marked improvement in her symptoms.",

He was hospitalized 10 days prior to presentation after being diagnosed with COVID 19 pneumonia. During that admission, he had a normal BNP and troponin I level; however, d-dimer level was not performed. He remained in the hospital for 3 days requiring intermittent oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and discharged subsequently. He didn't receive any thromboprophylaxis during that admission as he was ambulatory and wasn't deemed high risk for VTE. Three days after discharge, he started having shortness of breath again which he attributed to his infection. Nevertheless, as his condition continued worsening, he presented back to the hospital 10 days post-discharge. On initial evaluation, he was hemodynamically stable, tachypneic but adequately saturating at room air. A 12\u2011lead EKG was remarkable for new T wave inversions in the right precordial leads. Laboratory analyses revealed a slightly elevated BNP at 132 pg/mL (reference: \u2264100 pg/mL), and an unremarkable troponin I level. A bedside 2D echocardiogram performed revealed the presence of McConnell's sign along with enlarged right ventricle and interventricular septal flattening at diastole and end-systole. A CTA scan of the chest was performed and revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the distal right and left main branches and extending to the segmental branches. The decision was made to proceed with systemic t-PA and was followed by therapeutic heparin infusion. He improved markedly without any complications and was discharged on Apixaban.",

            "text": "VTEs and hypercoagulability have been reported previously in severe respiratory tract infections such as influenza [6,7]. It is believed that respiratory viruses might play a major role in the coagulation cascade. Visseren et al. showed that in vitro infection of cultured human endothelial cells with respiratory viruses induce a procoagulant state [8]. This was characterized by decreased assay clotting time along with a 4 to 5-fold increase in tissue factor expression [8]. As the COVID 19 pandemic continues to progress, we are learning more and more about the dysregulated hemostatic pathways and coagulation defects observed in the disease. Inflammation of lung parenchymal cells and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells may cause an increased release of procoagulant factors. Thereby, inducing the coagulation cascade and causing de novo thrombosis and fibrin deposition within the pulmonary vasculature. Tang et al. showed in a recent study an association with decreased mortality among patients with severe COVID 19 infection who were treated initially with anticoagulation. This augments the possibility of thrombi or microthrombi formation within the pulmonary vasculature [3]. In addition, it is possible that this excessive cytokine release in the plasma of infected individuals has a crosstalk role with the coagulation cascade and its activation [9,10].",
