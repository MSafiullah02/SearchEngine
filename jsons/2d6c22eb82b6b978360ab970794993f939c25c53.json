The solutions to UIL problem facilitate cross-platform research on OSN users and enable many useful applications such as user profiling and recommendation. As the UIL labeled data are often lacking and costly to obtain, learning user embeddings for matching user identities using an unsupervised approach is therefore highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised UIL framework for enhancing existing user embedding-based UIL methods. Our proposed framework incorporates two key ideas, user-discriminative features and retrofitting embedding. The user-discriminative features enable us to differentiate a specific user identity from other users in its OSN. From the userdiscriminative features, we derive pairs of similar user identities across OSNs for retrofitting the base user embeddings of existing UIL methods. Through extensive experiments on three real-world OSN datasets, we show that our framework can leverage user-discriminative features to improve the accuracy of different user embedding-based UIL methods significantly. The quantum of improvement can also be surprisingly good even for existing UIL methods with very poor matching accuracy.",

It, however, has another set of challenges: 1) Unsupervised UIL method has to cope with multiple attributes with heterogeneity domains, preferably in a unified manner; 2) Discriminative cross-platform attribute similarities are needed to compare the attribute values; 3) The attribute importance need to be incorporated without pre-labeling.",

The choice of two platforms is to keep the description simple, as the framework can be easily generalized to handle more OSN platforms. The framework takes an existing user embedding as input, which we call the base embeddings.

The former typically extract features from user attributes (e.g., user name, profile description, content, and network) to train a classifier for predicting pairs of user identities to belong to the same users or not.

Factoid Embedding [21] is the state-of-art unsupervised approach which utilizes multiple user attributes to learn a user embeddings for UIL. The method first constructs factoids from user attributes and learns user identity latent representation by embedding the factoids. However, the user embedding is learned based on only local information of OSNs. Cross platforms features have been ignored. The UIL results, therefore, could be poor if the local user attribute information is noisy. Our proposed framework addresses this limitation by introducing user-discriminative features. In this paper, we will demonstrate how Factoid Embeddings can be used as input base embeddings so as to achieve improved UIL results.",

Our framework applies the user-discriminative features to derive pairs of cross-platform similar user identities for retrofitting the base user embeddings. Through extensive experiments on three real-world OSN datasets, we show that our proposed framework can leverage user-discriminative features to effectively improve the accuracy of different base user embeddings. For future work, we will conduct a more in-depth study on the parameters used in our framework, and will design methods to optimize them automatically.",

When the user-discriminative network features are applied, RE NE nb achieves even more improvement over RE NE n and NE. Both RE NE nb and FE utilize name and network attributes. RE NE nb significantly outperforms FE, demonstrating that retrofitting embedding can effectively use cross-platform similar user identities based on different user-discriminative features. The user-discriminative network features can improve the results more significantly because they are underexplored in the base user embedding. More results are in Supplementary D.4.
