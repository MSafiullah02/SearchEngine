This ultra-protective lung strategy ideally may improve outcomes by further minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [4, 6, 11\u201316]. Although ECMO support limited stress and strain with ultra-protective ventilation, the specific extent of lung rest strategy and the optimal mechanical ventilation settings targets during ECMO for severe ARDS patients remained uncertain [11\u201316]. There was no large multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial to address the optimal mechanical ventilation settings during ECMO in severe ARDS patients. In most clinical practice, the mechanical ventilation settings during the ECMO depended on the clinicians\u2019 experience [6]. A recent study from 3562 patients with ARDS enrolled in 9 previous reported randomized controlled trials concluded that decreases in driving pressure were strongly associated with increased survival for patients with ARDS [17]. However, it is uncertain whether a similar association between driving pressure and survival exists for severe ARDS patients receiving ECMO.",

There was no study compared different modes of ventilation during ECMO, and pressure-controlled mode appears to be advocated [12]. With pressure-controlled ventilation, pressure is maintained constant throughout inspiration, and flow decreases during inspiration and is often followed by a period of zero flow at end inspiration. Peak inspiratory pressure and peak alveolar pressure (plateau pressure) may be equal during no flow status [22]. Therefore, we used the difference between peak inspiratory pressure and PEEP as calculation of \u201cdynamic\u201d driving pressure. In fact, the most correct form can be obtained using transpulmonary driving pressure by esophageal manometry, but it is not easy to use in clinical practice. Reduction in dynamic driving pressure were found after ECMO initiation, and the values of survivors continued decreasing and exhibited significantly lower than nonsurvivors until day 7 (Fig. 2). Better lungs compliance and larger proportion of recovered functional lung size could have benefitted the survivors. Manipulation of driving pressure could be applied for ventilator management beside by adjusting the tidal volume and PEEP [18]. Although standardized ventilation protocol for ARDS patients before and after ECMO was followed, it remains unclear from our observational study to definitely conclude that driving pressure was causally related to outcome or simply another marker for ARDS severity and it needed further randomized controlled trials to confirm our findings.",

            "text": "Although ECMO facilitates the use of lung-protective ventilation, the optimal mechanical ventilation management is unknown [4, 6, 11\u201314]. The lowering levels of plateau pressure and tidal volume have been related to decreased mortality [16]. Therefore, an ultra-protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volume reduction (<4 ml/kg, PBW), airway pressure reduction and adequate PEEP was suggested to mitigate further VILI [4, 11\u201314]. Mechanical ventilation during ECMO may have an important impact on mortality. A cohort study of influenza A (H1N1)-induced ARDS patients receiving ECMO revealed that higher plateau pressure on the first day under ECMO was significantly associated with increased ICU mortality [23]. Another retrospective study demonstrated that higher PEEP levels during the first 3 days on ECMO were independently associated with lower ICU mortality [24]. A systemic review summarized ventilation practices in ARDS patients with ECMO, and mortality was lower among patients who had lower ventilation intensity following ECMO initiation [14]. Our present study found that pre-ECMO ventilator settings exhibited no significant difference. After ECMO initiation, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure and dynamic driving pressure were all decreased, while PEEP levels were relative maintained. Dynamic driving pressure during first 3 days of ECMO support was independently related to ICU mortality. Whether these mechanical settings affected the outcome was not well known, and more information will be obtained from an ongoing study in the future (SOLVE ARDS: Strategies for Optimal Lung Ventilation in ECMO for ARDS; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01990456).",

First, this study is a retrospective analysis in one referral medical center, which may limit the generalization to other ICUs or hospitals. Besides, there might be residual and unmeasured confounding variables not included in our study and other biases during long period of study from 2006 to 2015 that could influence outcome. Second, APACHE II score was assessed only on the day of ICU admission and may not really reflect the dynamics of critical illness and treatment response. Serial evaluation of organ dysfunction during study period may be a better predictor of prognosis. Third, early application of prolonged prone position for severe ARDS patients as rescue therapy had survival benefit, but only a small number of our patients (n = 2) underwent prone position before ECMO. Finally, although ultra-protective ventilation strategy with ECMO based on a tidal volume reduction (<4 ml/kg, PBW), our study showed relatively higher tidal volume (around 6 ml/kg, PBW) after ECMO support.",

Further large multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm the hypothesis that dynamic driving pressure could be a better predictor for survival in severe ARDS patients with ECMO support.",
