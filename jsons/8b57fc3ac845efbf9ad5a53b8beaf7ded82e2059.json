Here, we used multiplexed, sequencing-based assays to measure the effects 23 of 2,695 VKOR missense variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity in cultured human 24 cells. The large-scale functional data, along with an evolutionary coupling analysis, supports a 25 four transmembrane domain topology, with variants in transmembrane domains exhibiting 26 strongly deleterious effects on abundance and activity. Functionally constrained regions of the 27 protein define the active site, and we find that, of four conserved cysteines putatively critical for 28 function, only three are absolutely required. Finally, 25% of human VKOR missense variants show 29 reduced abundance or activity, possibly conferring warfarin sensitivity or causing disease. 30",

In this assay, if VKOR is active, a Factor IX domain reporter is carboxylated, secreted and 148 retained on the cell surface where it is detected with a carboxylation-specific, fluorophore-labeled 149 antibody. However, if VKOR is inactive, the reporter is not carboxylated and the antibody cannot 150 bind (Fig. 2a) . We modified the HEK293 activity reporter cell line to eliminate endogenous VKOR 151 activity by knocking out both VKORC1 and its paralog, VKORC1-like 1 (VKORC1L1) ( Recombination of WT VKORC1 into the landing pad of the HEK293 VKOR activity reporter cell 155 line yielded robust reporter activation, demonstrating that the reporter line could be used to assess 156 the activity of a library of VKOR variants (Fig. 2b) . 157",

Final activity scores and confidence intervals were computed from six replicates for a total 161 of 697 missense variants, 21.5% of those possible ( 2010). We found four clearly demarcated regions where charged substitutions profoundly reduced 187 VKOR abundance, relative to aliphatic substitutions (Fig. 3b) . To exclude the possibility that the 188 eGFP tag used in our VAMP-seq assay somehow affected topology, we also analyzed the activity 189 score data. The activity data, derived using native, untagged VKOR, revealed the same four 190 minima as the abundance data (Fig. 3c ). In addition to these four minima, we also observed an 191 activity score minimum at position 57, corresponding to a conserved serine at this position. This 192 serine occurs at the end of the lumenal half-helix hypothesized to shield the active site from non-193 specific oxidation, so it is likely this signal is the result of disruption of that half helix. Together, 194 these results strongly support the hypothesis that, like its distant bacterial homolog, human VKOR 195 has four transmembrane domains. 196",

Thus, we curated a total 381 of 215 variants that had either been previously reported in the literature as affecting warfarin 382 response (Supplementary Table 3 Table 4 ). All synonymous variants with the exception of two were WT-like or 393 possibly WT-like, while the three nonsense variants scored had as having low abundance (Fig.  394 6a). Missense variants spanned all abundance categories, with 129 (60%) having WT-like or 395 possibly WT-like abundance. 30 missense variants were low abundance, and 12 were high 396 abundance. The single known pathogenic variant R98W was low abundance (Fig. 6b) . We also 397 classified 54 variants according to their activity (Supplementary Table 4 , but it is unclear whether these variants have appreciable effects 405 on abundance or activity. We found that warfarin resistance variants span a range of abundances 406 and that the distribution of warfarin resistant variant abundance was not different from missense 407 variants generally (Fig. 6c , two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p= 0.438). Five warfarin-408 resistance variants had low abundance, suggesting that these variants must block drug binding 409 or increase activity to confer resistance. One variant, A26T, had high abundance, a possible 410 mechanism of warfarin resistance. The five warfarin resistance variants, R58G, W59L, V66M, 411 G71A, and N77S, whose activity we scored, were all WT-like. Thus, our abundance and activity 412 data are consistent with warfarin resistance arising largely from variants that block warfarin We conducted multiplexed assays to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR variants on 425 abundance and 697 variants on activity. Both abundance and activity data provided evidence for 426 a four transmembrane topology, which was further supported by evolutionary couplings analysis. 427",

For example, neither assay captures 451 variant effects on mRNA splicing. Both assays have limited dynamic ranges, meaning that subtle 452 effects on abundance or activity cannot be discerned. In addition, both assays have inherent 453 noise, largely arising from the limited number of cells we can sample due to the bottleneck of cell 454 sorting.

VKOR is inhibited by the anticoagulant drug warfarin 37 (Czogalla et al., 2016; Zimmermann and Matschiner, 1974), and VKORC1 polymorphisms 38 contribute to an estimated ~25% of warfarin dosing variability (Owen et al., 2010). For example, 39 variation in VKORC1 noncoding and coding sequence can cause warfarin resistance (weekly 40 warfarin dose > 105 mg) or warfarin sensitivity (weekly warfarin dose < ~10 mg) (Osinbowale et 41 al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2005). 42 Though 15 million prescriptions are written for warfarin each year 43 (https://www.clincalc.com), fundamental questions remain regarding its target, VKOR. For 44 example, the structure of human VKOR is unsolved, though a bacterial homolog has been 45 crystallized (Li et al., 2010). A homology model based on bacterial VKOR has four transmembrane 46 domains, but the quality of the homology model is unclear, as human VKOR has only 12% 47 sequence identity to bacterial VKOR. Moreover, experimental validation of VKOR topology 48 yielded mixed results: similar biochemical assays suggested either three-or four-49 transmembrane-domain topologies (Schulman et al., 2010; Tie et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2018). 50",

The 213 apparent change in free energy (\u0394\u0394Gapp) of insertion relative to wild type for every amino acid has 214 been determined experimentally using deep mutational scanning of bacterial membrane proteins 215 (A. A. Elazar et al., 2016). Median abundance score and \u0394\u0394Gapp for each amino acid are 216 correlated (Fig. 3h). In particular, the large energetic cost of insertion of transmembrane domains 217 with charged amino acids is apparent, including within the second transmembrane domain TMD2. 218 Beyond insertion energies of individual amino acids, the overall hydrophobicity of transmembrane 219 helices contributes to membrane protein insertion (A. A. Elazar et al., 2016), as well as topology 220 (A. Elazar et al., 2016) and degradation (Guerriero et al., 2017). To determine whether overall 221 helix hydrophobicity was a large factor contributing to abundance scores, we calculated the free 222 energy for insertion (\u0394Ghelix) of each helix in the four transmembrane domain model using the \u0394G 223 prediction server v1.0 (Hessa et al., 2007). The four helices of VKOR have different \u0394Ghelix, with 224 only transmembrane domain 3 having favorable \u0394Ghelix for insertion (TMD1: 0.435, TMD2: 1.551, 225 TMD3: -1.749, and TMD4: 1.734).

Amino acids with 253 calculated insertion energy. 254Detailed structural context of VKOR variant abundance effects 255Having confirmed that human VKOR has four transmembrane domains, we next explored 256 the detailed pattern of mutational effects we observed in the context of a four transmembrane 257 domain homology model. We generated a homology model of human VKOR with I-TASSER using 258 the bacterial VKOR structure(Shen et al., 2017;Yang et al., 2015). We performed hierarchical 259 clustering of positions based on abundance scores, which yielded four groups of positions with 260 characteristic mutational patterns(Fig. 4a). In Group 1, most substitutions were neutral or 261 increased abundance; in Group 2, charged amino acid and proline substitutions decreased 262 abundance; in Group 3, all substitutions decreased abundance; and in Group 4, all substitutions 263 decreased abundance profoundly. Each group corresponded to a spatially distinct region of the 264 homology model structure(Fig. 4b).265 Group 1 positions were located in or adjacent to cytoplasmic and ER lumenal loops, which 266 were more tolerant of substitutions than the transmembrane domains. At four Group 1 positions, 267 K30, R33, R35, and R37, almost every substitution increased abundance. These positively 268 charged positions are positioned either at the edge of TMD1 (K30) or in the ER lumen directly 269 abutting the top of TMD1 (R33, R35, and R37). The \"positive inside rule\" (von Heijne, 1989), 270 suggests that positive charges in membrane proteins generally reside in the cytoplasm, and this 271 phenomenon is important for driving topology and membrane insertion (A. Elazar et al., 2016; 272 Nilsson and von Heijne, 1990; von Heijne, 1989). K30, R33, R35, and R37 violate the positive 273 inside rule, and substitutions at these positions may increase abundance by reducing charge 274 inside the ER, reducing topological frustration or increasing membrane insertion efficiency. 275 Compared to the other 12 arginine and lysine positions in WT VKOR, K30, R33, R35, and R37 276 are the only ones where substitutions generally increased abundance (Figure 4-figure 277 supplement 1). Our observations are consistent with a screen of rat VKOR variants intended to 278 improve protein expression in E. coli where deletion of positions 31 to 33 increased protein levels 279 (Hatahet et al., 2015). 280 In Group 2, charged amino acids or proline substitutions generally decreased abundance. 281 Group 2 consisted mostly of transmembrane positions that had side chains projecting into the 282 lipid bilayer. Such transmembrane positions usually have hydrophobic, nonpolar side chains 283 (Ulmschneider and Sansom, 2001). Proline has poor helix forming propensity, explaining why 284 proline substitutions decreased abundance at these positions. Group 3 consisted of a mixture of 285 cytoplasmic, ER lumenal and transmembrane positions where most substitutions decreased 286 abundance. The cytoplasmic positions in this group included the putative dilysine ER localization 287 motif at positions 159 and 161. Also in this group were R98, part of another putative ER retention 288 motif at positions 98 and 100, and a glycine adjacent to TMD1 at position nine. The 289 transmembrane positions had side chains projecting towards neighboring transmembrane 290 helices, suggesting that, as for other membrane proteins (Fleming and Engelman, 2001; Mravic 291 et al., 2019), intramolecular sidechain packing is important for abundance. 292 Finally, substitutions in Group 4, consisting of positions G19, Y88, I141, and L145, resulted 293 in catastrophic loss of abundance. These positions are all in transmembrane domains with side 294 chains projecting into the interior of the protein. On the basis of strict mutational intolerance of 295 these positions, we hypothesized that their coordinated side chain packing comprises the core of 296 the VKOR four helix bundle. Indeed, Group 4 residues had dramatically lower relative solvent 297 accessibility than Groups 1-3 (Fig. 4c). 298 The four transmembrane domain homology models also allowed us to explain VKOR's 299 unusual trimodal distribution of variant abundance scores. Previous VAMP-seq derived 300 abundance score distributions for the cytosolic proteins TPMT and PTEN were bimodal (Figure 301 4-figure supplement 2) (Matreyek et al., 2018), and 15 of 16 deep mutational scans of other 302 soluble proteins using a variety of other assays also exhibited bimodal functional score 303 distributions (Gray et al., 2017). Because VKOR is an ER resident, transmembrane protein, we 304 hypothesized that its unusual trimodal abundance score distribution resulted from transmembrane 305 domain substitutions. Indeed, the lowest mode of the distribution was composed almost Hierarchical clustering of abundance scores and distributions of abundance and 312 activity scores by domain. a, A heatmap showing hierarchical clustering of positions based on 313 abundance score vectors, with the dendrogram above.

Thus, we calculated the 329 specific activity for each variant by taking the ratio of its rescaled activity score and abundance 330 scores (see Methods) ratio. We computed the median specific activity for each position; 331 substitutions at positions with low median specific activity generally have low activity relative to 332 their abundance. We set a specific activity threshold based on two absolutely conserved cysteines 333 that form VKOR's redox center, C132 and C135. Using this threshold, positions with the lowest 334 12.5% of specific activity scores and with at least four variants scored for activity were deemed 335 functionally constrained and mapped on the homology model of VKOR(Fig. 5a, Figure 5-figure 336supplement 1). These 11 functionally constrained positions are organized around C132 and C135 337 and define, at least in part, the VKOR active site(Fig. 5b,c, Figure 5-figure supplements 1).338 Among the functionally constrained positions are six positions previously identified in vitamin K 339 docking simulations (Czogalla et al., 2016) (Figure 5-figure supplement 1), including F55, which 340 is hypothesized to bind vitamin K. Three functionally constrained positions, G60, R61, and A121, 341 did not match any position in the active site predicted by docking, but were immediate neighbors 342 of W59 and L120, positions that were. 343 Besides C132 and C135, VKOR has two additional absolutely conserved cysteines, C43 344 and C51. In the four transmembrane domain model, C43 and C51 are postulated to be loop 345 cysteines that relay electrons to the C132/C135 redox center (Liu et al., 2014). We classified C43 346 as having low specific activity, but we only observed one variant at this position, so it was not 347 included in our set of functionally constrained positions (Figure 5-figure supplement 2). In 348 contrast, substitutions at C51 resulted in only modest activity loss, a phenomenon that has been 349 observed previously (Shen et al., 2017). Interestingly, every substitution at C51 and 15 of 19 at 350 C132 decreased VKOR abundance (Figure 5-figure supplement 2). Inside cells, the majority of 351 22 VKOR molecules have a C51-C132 disulfide bond, and warfarin binds to this redox state of VKOR 352 (Shen et al., 2017). Since disruption of this disulfide bond apparently impacts abundance as well 353 as activity, this bond may be important for VKOR folding and stability. 354 VKOR is thought to contain two sequences important for ER localization. The first is a 355 diarginine motif (RxR) at positions 98-100, and the second is a dilysine motif (KXKXX) at positions 356 159-163. While we did not directly measure localization, we found that only six of 19 R98 variants 357 and seven of 14 R100 variants resulted in low abundance (Figure 5-figure supplement 3). In 358 contrast, nearly all variants at K159 (14 of 18) and K161 (17 of 19) resulted in low abundance 359 (Figure 5-figure supplement 3). A histidine substitution was tolerated at position 161, which 360 mimics the KXHXX motif commonly found in coronaviruses and a small number of human proteins 361 (Ma and Goldberg, 2013). Because protein localization and degradation are coupled (Hessa et 362 al., 2011), we suggest that the reductions in abundance we observe are the result of degradation 363 caused by mislocalization, and that the dilysine motif at positions 159-163 is essential for VKOR 364 ER localization. Overall, comparison of VKOR variant activity and abundance revealed 365 functionally important regions, refining our understanding of the active site, redoxFunctionally constrained positions reveal VKOR active site and critical cysteines. 369 a, Positions with the lowest 12.5% of median specific activity scores and at least four variants 370 scored for activity are shown as magenta spheres on the VKOR homology model.

These frequencies were then each 791 57 weighted by multiplying by 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 in a bin-wise fashion.

We then averaged those scores for a final, experiment-wide 795 variant score. Standard deviation and standard error were also calculated for each variant, and 796 95% confidence intervals were estimated using standard error, assuming a normal distribution. 797Abundance and activity classifications were assigned by assessing variant score and confidence 798 intervals in relation to synonymous variant distribution. To do this, we established a cut-off that 799 separated the 5% of synonymous variants with the lowest abundance (or activity) scores from the 800 95% of synonymous variants with higher abundance (or activity) scores. Variants with both scores 801 and upper confidence intervals below this threshold were classified as \"low,\" while those with 802 scores below but upper confidence above were classified as \"possibly low.\" Variants with scores 803 and lower confidence intervals above the threshold were classified as \"WT-like\", while those with 804 scores above lower confidence intervals below the threshold were classified as \"possibly WT-805 like.\" Finally, another threshold was set that separated the 5% of synonymous variants with the 806 highest scores from the rest of the synonymous distribution.

We collected an alignment of 2770 sequences using 819 jackhammer (http://hmmer.org/) to query the human VKOR sequence against UniRef100 820 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniref/), with a bitscore per residue cutoffs of 0.4 and 7 search iterations. 821We predicted secondary structures where the summed strength of couplings at would-be alpha 822 helix and beta strand contacts scored above 1.5 for alpha helices and 0.75 respectively, for two 823 or more consecutive residues. We extended the called helices and strands by one residue on 824 each side for a minimum structure size of four residues. All methods used for building alignments, Activity and abundance scores were rescaled so that the lowest score present in the 840 dataset was set at 0, and the highest score at 1. A ratio of rescaled activity to rescaled abundance 841 (specific activity) was then calculated for every variant. Using variant specific activity scores, 842 median specific activity was calculated for each position. Threshold for classification as an active 843 59 site position was drawn based on scores of known redox cysteines at positions 132 and 135, 844 resulting in lowest 12.5% of median specific activity scores being classified as active site residues. 845We additionally required that any position within this group had been scored for at least four 846 variants to eliminate noise from poor sampling.
