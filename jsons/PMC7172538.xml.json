            "text": "Determining the microbial cause of infectious diseases usually requires detection of multiple possible viruses in clinical specimens. Isolation and electron microscopic examination are labor-intensive, time-consuming and associated with long turn-around-time. Although direct antigen detection is cost-effective with high clinical impact in respiratory infections, no comprehensive set of monoclonal antibodies against each possible virus is available for different types of clinical specimens.1 Nucleic acid detection can potentially overcome the above problems, as designing primers for individual viruses is not difficult given the publicly available gene databases and the whole detection process can be performed within a few hours. Strategies such as multiplex PCR have been devised to detect nucleic acids of multiple viruses simultaneously. One technology that had emerged in recent years to achieve this purpose is high-density resequencing microarray platform. In this technology, total nucleic acid extracted from samples is subject to reverse transcription and multiplex PCR. The PCR products are pooled, purified, fragmented, end-labeled with biotin, hybridized to complementary sequences of potential targets on a microarray, and detected with fluorescent dye. The array is scanned and analyzed. It has been shown that such high-density resequencing microarray is useful for detection and tracking the evolution of viruses associated with respiratory infections.2, 3, 4, 5\n",

This is in line with other epidemiological studies, which have shown that HAdVs species B and D are causes of pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.8 The only culture-positive virus was of type 3, concurring with the results of hexon gene sequencing. Although the panel of RPM-Flu-3.1 included HAdVs type 2 (species C), 4 (species E), 7 (species B) and 17 (species D), it was not able to accurately determine the HAdV in the clinical samples to the species level.

Resequencing microarray has the advantage of simultaneous detection of multiple possible microbiological causes of specific infectious disease syndromes. For example, for respiratory infections, molecular detection of viruses requires setting up PCR/RT-PCR for influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, HAdVs, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and rhinoviruses, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Although antigen detection by immunofluorescence has allowed detection of multiple viruses, monoclonal antibodies against all possible viruses are not available.1 On the other hand, resequencing microarray allows detection of all these viruses simultaneously. In the present study, we have also shown that samples can be pooled for the resequencing microarray without sacrificing sensitivity, and subsequent PCR/RT-PCR using specific primers targeting the positive virus was performed for delineating the positive sample(s) in the pooled sample, as well as determining the species of the corresponding HAdV. The cost of using pooled samples as performed in this study was just about one quarter of that if each individual sample was studied by RPM-Flu-3.1. This has the additional advantage of saving cost, as the cost for a microarray is still high at the moment.",
