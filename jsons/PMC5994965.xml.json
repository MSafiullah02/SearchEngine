Semi-nested PCR (using initial PCR product as template for second reaction) was used to get adequate concentrations of the product from degraded DNA samples (feces). The initial external primer pair (F3A, SAA1R; Table 1) amplified a 716bp segment of the SAA1A promoter specifically; the seminested reaction with an alternative forward primer (SAA1F; Table 1) produced a smaller PCR product (186bp) containing the putative NF-\u03baB binding site. The first PCR product was either purified using the QIAquick\u00ae Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN\u00ae) or was treated with ExoSAP-IT\u00ae (Affymetrix) before being used as template for the second reaction. Both polymerase chain reactions were carried out using GoTaq\u00ae Green Master Mix (Promega). The touchdown PCR protocol entailed an initial denaturing step of 94 \u00b0C for 10min, followed by 10 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15s (denaturation), 60\u201350 \u00b0C for 30s (annealing; temperature was dropped by 1 \u00b0C per cycle) and 72 \u00b0C for 45s (extension), then 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15s (denaturation), 50 \u00b0C for 30s (annealing) and 72 \u00b0C for 45s (extension), followed by a final extension step of 72 \u00b0C for 30min. A subset of the PCR products (n = 86) were genotyped by standard Sanger sequencing via GENEWIZ\u00ae Inc. To prepare samples for shipment, the PCR products were purified using the QIAquick\u00ae Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN\u00ae) and premixed with the SAA1F primer. Chromatograms were interpreted for determination of genotype. SAA1A+/+ and SAA1A\u221297delG/\u221297delG genotypes contained clear distinguishable peaks on the chromatogram and were distinguished from each other by the number of guanine residues at position \u221297.

For this, the SAA1 promoter region was amplified for 6 cheetahs (2 with each genotype) and results compared to those of the nested PCR. The SAA1B gene lacks the SAA1A\u221297delG SNP (Chen et al. 2012), thus amplification of both SAA1A and SAA1B promoters simultaneously produced 4 amplified products: 2 (corresponding to the SAA1B gene) always appearing as SAA1A+ and the other 2 being dictated by the SAA1A genotype.

In some cases, susceptibility appears to be genetic (familial amyloidosis), as observed in Shar-Pei dogs (Rivas et al. 1993), Abyssinian (Boyce et al. 1984) and Siamese (van der Linde-Sipman et al. 1997) breeds of domestic cats, and black-footed cats (Terio et al. 2008). Among other species, AA amyloidosis is considered \u201creactive\u201d and does not have a genetic basis, but rather appears secondary to other inflammatory conditions, as observed in bighorn sheep (Hadlow and Jellison 1962), bat (Gruber and Linke 1996), Dorcas gazelle (Rideout et al. 1989) and humans (De Beer et al. 1982). Domestic cats are an interesting species to examine because the traditional domestic short hair (DSH) cat is not often affected by amyloidosis, while the Siamese and Abyssinian breeds have inherited forms of the disease, though the genetic variants implicated in the heritable disease are different between these 2 breeds (Niewold et al. 1999). The cheetah AA protein amino acid sequence is more similar to that of Abyssinian cats than DSH cats, having concordance at 5 of 8 positions of variability with Abyssinian cats but only 2 with DSH cats (Johnson et al. 1997), which suggests the possibility that cheetah AA protein may be structured in a way that makes it more amyloidogenic compared to the domestic cat AA protein. However, AA amyloidosis is uncommon among wild cheetahs (Munson et al. 2005), suggesting that the amyloidosis observed in cheetahs is not of a true \u201cfamilial\u201d type and rather secondary to chronic inflammation.",

This study shows that the SAA1A\u221297delG allele is similarly associated with a decrease in the SAA concentration in serum of captive cheetahs. However, genetic variation only accounted for 2.7% of the total phenotypic variation in SAA concentration. Much greater significant differences in SAA concentrations were observed between sick and healthy cheetahs. Sick cheetahs had significantly higher SAA concentrations compared to healthy cheetahs. This result is unsurprising given that SAA is an APP which is upregulated in response to inflammation. Among the deceased cheetahs with known AA amyloidosis diagnoses, 88.5% of cheetahs confirmed positive for AA amyloidosis also had moderate to chronic inflammation of any kind, compared to only 28.6% of cheetahs confirmed AA amyloidosis negative at necropsy.",

Interestingly, cheetahs have a T at the \u221213 position in the SAA1 promoter (Zhang et al. 2008) and this nucleotide position is not polymorphic (Chen et al. 2012), therefore all cheetahs may be predisposed to developing secondary AA amyloidosis in the presence of chronic inflammation.",
