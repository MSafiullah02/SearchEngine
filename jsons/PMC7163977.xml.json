            "text": "Infectious diseases pose a particular threat to high\u2010density populations and group\u2010living species with high contact rates (Hawley & Altizer, 2011). There may be substantial variation among members of a group in their degree of exposure to a given pathogen and in the outcome of infection (Beldomenico & Begon, 2010; VanderWaal & Ezenwa, 2016). Body condition and the ability to allocate resources to immune processes can profoundly affect the outcome of infection as can sex, age and social status (East et al., 2015; Schmid\u2010Hempel, 2003). Quantifying individual differences in the outcome of infection and determining the impact of infection on Darwinian fitness in wildlife populations may be a challenge because diagnosing the infection status for large numbers of individuals is difficult in practice, particularly if only non\u2010invasive methods are available (Gimenez, Lebreton, Gaillard, Choquet, & Pradel, 2012; McClintock et al., 2010). This probably explains why little is known about these processes in natural environments. Obtaining such information is, however, crucial to improve knowledge of host\u2013pathogen dynamics and predict the likely impact of diseases, particularly during epidemics, on the most vulnerable classes of individuals and on population long\u2010term viability (Gervasi, Civitello, Kilvitis, & Martin, 2015; Hawley & Altizer, 2011; Kappeler, Cremer, & Nunn, 2015; Oli, Venkataraman, Klein, Wendland, & Brown, 2006).",

            "text": "In social mammals with stable dominance hierarchies, an individual's social status regulates its access to (food) resources and is thus often positively correlated with both body condition and fitness (Clutton\u2010Brock & Huchard, 2013). Even so, the relationship between an individual's social status and the outcome of infection with a given pathogen is less straightforward. Several studies suggest that socially dominant animals are more frequently exposed to pathogens because they are \u201cvaluable\u201d social partners which experience higher contact rates with conspecifics than subordinates, for instance when forming and maintaining social bonds (Seyfarth, 1977). Such a positive relationship between social status and exposure has been shown in several mammals (e.g. MacIntosh et al., 2012). On the other hand, subordinate individuals may be less exposed but more likely to contract diseases than dominants and experience a more severe outcome when infected. This is because subordinates, whose access to resources is limited, have a higher allostatic load, i.e. a higher cumulative energetic cost of maintaining homeostasis (Cavigelli & Chaudhry, 2012; Goymann & Wingfield, 2004; Kappeler et al., 2015; Sapolsky, 2005), and thus their allocation of resources to immune processes is more often curtailed. Despite considerable research into the influence of social processes on disease risk and spread, often with the use of social network analyses (e.g. Cauchemez et al., 2011; Duboscq, Romano V., & MacIntosh, 2016; Kappeler et al., 2015; MacIntosh et al., 2012; Nunn, Jord\u00e1n, McCabe, Verdolin, & Fewell, 2015), to our knowledge few studies on wildlife populations have investigated the effect of social status on fitness by explicitly accounting for the effect of both these processes: (1) variation in exposure to a pathogen (\u201cexposure\u201d hypothesis) and (2) variation in the outcome of infection determined by the opportunity to allocate resources to immune processes (\u201callocation\u201d hypothesis).",

Here, we used this approach to assess the effect of social status in a highly social carnivore, the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta (hereafter \u201chyena\u201d) on canine distemper virus (CDV) infection during an epidemic when a strain pathogenic to this species circulated (Nikolin et al., 2017). CDV is a highly contagious virus of a taxonomically broad range of carnivores (Beineke, Baumg\u00e4rtner, & Wohlsein, 2015; Deem, Spelman, Yates, & Montali, 2000). The outcome of CDV infection ranges from subclinical to fatal, and as with other morbilliviruses, individuals surviving the infection acquire lifelong immunity (Appel & Summers, 1995). After transmission to a susceptible host, CDV targets lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphatic tissue and induces immunosuppression, which enhances the spread of CDV through the bloodstream (asymptomatic and non\u2010contagious stage, Tatsuo, Ono, & Yanagi, 2001). In the next stage, CDV enters epithelial cells, which results in the manifestation of clinical disease and virus shedding (Sawatsky, Wong, Hinkelmann, Cattaneo, & von Messling, 2012) and finally, CDV attacks the central nervous system, causing neurological signs (symptomatic and contagious stages). During all stages, CDV profoundly suppresses host immune responses, predisposing infected animals to secondary infections (Sawatsky et al., 2012).",

In hyenas, noticeable \u201chotspots of infection\u201d (i.e. clinical disease and increased mortality) were primarily observed in cubs stationed at communal dens (Haas et al., 1996). CDV strains that infected lions and hyenas during this epidemic were genetically distinct from those infecting canids and encoded unique mutations that most likely increased the virulence of the 1993/1994 epidemic for non\u2010canids (Nikolin et al., 2017).",

High\u2010ranking females (Hofer & East, 2003) and males (East & Hofer, 1991) are thus present more often in the clan territory than low\u2010ranking ones and have high intimate contact with clan members, including cubs at the communal den (East, Hofer, & Wickler, 1993). Furthermore, the mean rate at which cubs, subadults, adult females and immigrant adult males received friendly oral contacts as well as bites increases with their social status (East et al., 2001). Similarly, in another population, high\u2010ranking females are also more gregarious than low\u2010ranking ones, forming more bonds and receiving more frequent social support (Engh, Siebert, Greenberg, & Holekamp, 2005; Ilany, Booms, & Holekamp, 2015; Smith, Memenis, & Holekamp, 2007). The importance of elevated contact rates among high\u2010ranking clan members for the transmission of infectious pathogens is illustrated by significantly higher seroprevalence to virus infections among high\u2010ranking than low\u2010ranking hyenas in our study population (East et al., 2001) as well as in another one (Harrison et al., 2004). High\u2010ranking hyenas within the separate linear dominance hierarchies among adult females (plus their offspring) (Hofer & East, 2003) and among adult reproductively active males (East & Hofer, 2001) have high rates of contact with clan members, thereby facilitating \u201chyena\u2010to\u2010hyena\u201d CDV transmission through contact with virus shedding individuals. The exposure hypothesis therefore predicts that high\u2010ranking hyenas, females in particular, are more likely to get infected with CDV than low\u2010ranking ones (Figure 1).",

Data were collected from all clan members and individuals were identified by their unique spot patterns, scars and other characteristics such as ear notches. Clans contained philopatric females, which breed throughout the year (Hofer & East, 1995), and their offspring, plus breeding males that are mostly immigrants (East & Hofer, 2001). Females and their offspring were socially dominant over immigrant males (Hofer & East, 2003). Females and natal males were first detected and aged within their first few weeks of life as previously detailed (e.g. Hofer & East, 1993a, 2003). Sex was assessed at c. 3 months of age using the dimorphic glans morphology of the erect phallus following Frank, Glickman, and Licht (1991).

Female cubs were younger than 1 year. Subadult females were aged between 1 and 2 years. Female breeders gave birth to a litter during a given year, as documented by a freshly ruptured clitoris caused by parturitions (Hofer & East, 1993b) and/or subsequent lactation, whereas non\u2010breeders did not. The vast majority of female breeders were lactating females; hence, this state represented the elevated energetic cost of lactation (Hofer et al., 2016). Males (N = 816) were classified as cubs (C), pre\u2010breeders (PB) or breeders (B). Male cubs were younger than 1 year. Male pre\u2010breeders were older than 1 year, still members of their natal clan and had not yet started reproducing. Both pre\u2010breeder males and subadult females spent most of their time away from communal dens. Male breeders showed reproductive behaviour (East & Hofer, 2001) towards female clan members or were verified by DNA microsatellite profiling to have fathered at least one cub (H\u00f6ner et al., 2012). Breeders were predominately immigrant males, a minority of cases (12%) were reproductively active natal males. As males do not participate in parental care, we did not distinguish between male breeder and non\u2010breeder states.",

We recorded submissive behaviours during dyadic adult female\u2013female and adult male\u2013male interactions (e.g. East et al., 2003; Hofer & East, 2003) and constructed strictly linear dominance hierarchies for each clan. Interactions were recorded ad libitum during frequent observation periods of c. 3 hr duration at both dawn and dusk, mostly at clan dens and during all\u2010night observations. Dominance hierarchies were adjusted after each loss or recruitment of adults and when dyadic interaction data revealed than an individual had increased or fallen in rank. To permit the comparison of the ranks held by individuals within hierarchies containing different numbers of animals within and across clans and years, we computed for each rank held by an individual during its lifetime a standardized rank. This measure places the ranks within a given hierarchy evenly between the highest (standardized rank: +1) and the lowest (standardized rank: \u22121) rank (East et al., 2003; Goymann et al., 2001). For breeder and non\u2010breeder females, and breeder and pre\u2010breeders males older than 2 years, the social states were high\u2010ranking (H: average standardized rank ranging from 0.01 to +1) and low\u2010ranking (L: average standardized rank ranging from \u22121 to 0). If different social states were observed for an individual within a year, we assigned the most frequently observed state (i.e. H or L) during that year for that individual. The yearly proportions of H and L states among females and among males were not exactly 50%\u201350% in each clan because (1) we calculated standardized ranks for each stable period (i.e. when no losses or recruitment of adults to the hierarchy occurred and the ranks held by individuals did not change) and each year was constituted by a variable number of such periods and because (2) we assigned the social state of the genetic mother to female and male cubs, female subadults and male pre\u2010breeders younger than 2 years for non\u2010adopted offspring, and that of the surrogate mother for adopted offspring (as offspring typically acquire a rank immediately below that of the female that reared them, Hofer & East, 2003; East et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The impact of the 1993/1994 CDV epidemic on hyenas in the Serengeti NP was substantial, particularly among young animals. Maternal social status had a substantial impact on the probability of cub infection and its outcome. High\u2010born cubs were less likely to be infected and incurred a smaller reduction in their survival once infected (female cubs 16%, male cubs 20%) than low\u2010born cubs (female cubs 31%, male cubs 36%, Table 2, Figure 3b,d). These findings are consistent with the idea that high\u2010born cubs allocate substantially more resources to immune processes than low\u2010born ones because their milk intake is significantly higher (Hofer & East, 1993b, 2003; Hofer et al., 2016). This suggests that the rank\u2010related ability to allocate resources to immune processes is more important in determining the outcome of infection in dependent hyena cubs than differences in CDV exposure. Our results are consistent with other studies on hyenas that provide evidence that social status affects the allocation of resources to immune processes and the outcome of infection. During lactation, low\u2010ranking female hyenas have significantly higher helminth egg burdens and are more likely to have concurrent protozoan parasite infections than high\u2010ranking females (East et al., 2015). Similarly, nutritionally disadvantaged hyenas suffered higher mortality during an outbreak of a pathogenic bacterium (H\u00f6ner et al., 2012). Higher serum concentrations of the immunoglobulin IgM in high\u2010ranking females may reflect a greater allocation of resources to immune processes (Flies et al., 2016). Rank\u2010related differences in the expression of immune genes have been reported in a non\u2010human primate (Tung et al., 2012).",

Even so, we cannot exclude the possibility that high\u2010 and low\u2010ranking cubs differ in their immune responses because of differences in their allelic composition of immune genes. The cost of mate\u2010choice is higher for low\u2010ranking than high\u2010ranking females (East et al., 2003) and hence a genetic component may in part explain the more severe outcome of CDV infection low\u2010ranking cubs.",

Interestingly, the reduction in survival was similar between social states (high\u2010born 30%, low\u2010born 28%; Table 2). As weaning usually takes place during the second year of life, the demographic class of subadults comprised both unweaned and weaned life stages. Variation in the contribution of milk and solid food to the diet of subadults may explain why differences in the survival of high\u2010ranking and low\u2010ranking infected and recovered female subadults were less clear\u2010cut than for cubs, whose survival completely depends on maternal milk (Hofer & East, 1993b). Among pre\u2010breeder males, there was no effect of social status and no difference in the survival of infected high\u2010ranking and low\u2010ranking individuals. The reduction in survival for pre\u2010breeder males was substantial and of a similar magnitude to that in subadult females (high\u2010born 27%, low\u2010born 33%, Table 2, Figure 3d).",

CDV substantially depletes lymphoid organs and lymphocytes, reduces responses of immunomodulatory cytokines and upregulates inflammatory cytokines. Direct virus\u2010mediated damage and pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine\u2010induced damage to the central nervous system can also occur (Beineke et al., 2009). The CDV strain that infected hyenas in the 1993/1994 epidemic encoded one novel amino acid in the V\u2010protein (Nikolin et al., 2017). The V\u2010protein is known to disrupt host interferon signalling (von Messling, Svitek, & Cattaneo, 2006; R\u00f6thlisberger et al., 2010), hence rendering the outcome of infection particularly severe. As repairing CDV\u2010damaged tissues and mounting immune responses to infection are costly in terms of body resources, hosts that do not meet these costs are prone to secondary infections that then fuel this \u201cvicious circle\u201d (Beineke et al., 2009; Beldomenico & Begon, 2010). The hitherto unsuspected, delayed and detrimental effect of CDV infection in female subadult and male pre\u2010breeder hyenas most likely resulted from the severe pathologies caused by a non\u2010canid adapted CDV strain.",

Although adults exposed to CDV before the 1993/1994 epidemic presumably had protective antibody titres, the lack of clinical canine distemper in adult hyenas during this epidemic was probably due to other components of the immune system. Hyenas, like the domestic cat Felis catus (Beineke et al., 2015), can have CDV replicating in leucocytes without developing clinical disease (Nikolin et al., 2017). Since in long\u2010lived species, adult survival is a critical fitness component, natural selection may also favour the development of stronger adult immune defences to minimize the impact of infections (Boots, Best, Miller, & White, 2009).",

These suggest that immune responses may be more efficacious in female than in male hyenas, as found in many mammals, birds and reptiles (reviewed in Klein & Flanagan, 2016). Rank\u2010related differences in social contact among females probably explain why high\u2010ranking females are more likely to become infected than low\u2010ranking ones (Table 2). This result is consistent with the findings of a previous study in the same hyena population where the higher contact rates of high\u2010ranking adult females significantly increased their probability of exposure to rabies (East et al., 2001). Interestingly, more frequent (asymptomatic) exposure to CDV among high\u2010ranking adult females would induce protective CDV titres and may have benefitted their cubs through the transfer of these antibodies during lactation, an idea consistent with our finding that high\u2010ranking cubs had a lower infection probability than low\u2010ranking ones. The effect of social status among males was not identifiable. Interestingly, males had a higher infection probability than females despite the lower probability of assigning an infected state to males (see Supporting Information, section 3.b). Because our MECMR model allowed us to account for such uncertainty, we consider this a robust result.",

Hence, communal dens would have promoted a high level of exposure among clan members during the epidemic. Similarly, the transmission of airborne viruses in clusters of susceptible individuals with intense social contacts, such as in schools and kindergartens, is known to drive epidemics of measles (Garenne et al., 1991; Paunio et al., 1998) and the H1N1 strain of avian influenza (Cauchemez et al., 2011). The impact of these viruses on the fitness of susceptible (non\u2010vaccinated) juveniles was not quantified. Our study does quantify the lethal impact of an infectious juvenile viral disease in a fission\u2013fusion society, similar to that in humans, and with transmission hotspots (communal dens) similar to schools and kindergartens.

This research demonstrates that social contact rates (e.g. grooming) could influence disease transmission or burden and vice\u2010versa (e.g. Bansal, Read, Pourbohloul, & Meyers, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Duboscq et al., 2016). Social networks are increasingly integrating disease dynamics in their analyses (e.g. Springer, Kappeler, & Nunn, 2017; Vazquez\u2010Prokopec et al., 2013; Volz & Meyers, 2007) but to our knowledge no network\u2010based study has ever considered dynamic processes in both the pathogen and the host. The main challenge of social network analyses most likely lies in the difficulty of describing feedback dynamics between host social networks and disease\u2010related fitness costs in the host (Van Segbroeck, Santos, & Pacheco, 2010; Volz & Meyers, 2007). As an alternative to social network analysis, other studies, including ours, use surrogate variables for contact rates. We used classes of social status, others used the number of animals encountered simultaneously in the same area (Cross et al., 2004), breeding status (Genton et al., 2015) or indirect measures of socio\u2010economic status in many human societies (Sapolsky, 2005).",

Therefore, such studies do not disentangle the effect of variation in exposure in terms of contact rates with infected individuals from immunocompetence (Kappeler et al., 2015). Nevertheless, some empirical studies have used statistical inference to disentangle the effects of exposure from those of immune responses to exposure in the propagation of infectious disease (Civitello & Rohr, 2014) or describe potential methodological approaches to achieve this (Rhodes, Halloran, & Longini, 1996). These methodological approaches may be applicable to experimental studies but not to non\u2010invasive studies on free\u2010ranging species that include uncertainty in the infection status of the host. Models that account for unavoidable uncertainty in the infection state of individuals either lump these two processes (i.e. exposure and allocation) or consider only one of these two processes (e.g. Chambert et al., 2012; Choquet, Carri\u00e9, Chambert, & Boulinier, 2013).",

Jennelle, Cooch, Conroy, & Senar, 2007). However, one potential limitation of our study, and possibly of other studies based on non\u2010invasive or opportunistic sample collections, is the risk of misclassification of infection states due to diagnostic inaccuracy and imperfect state observation. Buzdugan, Vergne, Grosbois, Delahay, and Drewe (2017) proposed the first approach to estimate probabilities associated with an individual's infection state at any given point, depending on prior and current knowledge about that individual's health status. Although this approach is promising, it is not applicable to studies such as ours that do not routinely run multiple diagnostic tests in series or parallel. We chose to model uncertainty on the assignment of infection states; others chose to model the risk of not correctly assigning those states (Buzdugan et al., 2017). To our knowledge, no study has ever modelled both types of uncertainty simultaneously; probably because this would require extensive data on health status.",

Furthermore, we were able to test for an interaction effect between social and infection states on survival. We therefore could quantify the outcome of CDV infection in different demographic and social classes and demonstrate that demographic and social states mediated the positive relationship between CDV infection and mortality. Finally, the parameters estimated by this approach can easily be combined with matrix models to provide a highly powerful tool to examine the long\u2010term consequences of epidemics at the population level (Oli et al., 2006).",
