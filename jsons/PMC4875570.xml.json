In these cases, specificity is dictated by direct readout of a particular isopeptide-linkage via binding the primed (S1\u2032) Ub and unprimed, or proximal, (S1) Ub across the DUB active site. In one case, Lys11-specificity of the OTUD2 catalytic core is achieved by recognizing S1\u2032 Ub and S1 Ub across the DUB active site, an activity that is aided by another domain that contacts a third Ub in a distal S2 site (Mevissen et al., 2013). Lys48-linked Ub chains are highly abundant in cells (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006), and their conjugation to other proteins targets them for proteasomal degradation (Chau et al., 1989), but the molecular basis for DUB recognition of Lys48-linked Ub chains remains unclear.",

The structure of SARS PLpro bound to monoUb revealed surfaces required for S1 recognition and plausible explanations for Ub chain specificity and potential surfaces important for S2 recognition (Ratia et al., 2014), but the molecular basis for SARS PLpro Lys48-Ub chain specificity remains unknown. We report the crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUbLys48-ABP. The structure reveals SARS PLpro DUB recognition of an extended Lys48-linked diUb chain via distinct S1Ub and S2Ub binding sites, and biochemical studies show that S2Ub binding is most important for polyUb processing. The molecular basis for diUbLys48 recognition by a Lys48-specific DUB has remained unclear, and in this case, SARS PLpro Ub chain specificity is dominated by indirect readout of a unique diUb chain conformation at a site distal from the active site.",

This unique activity is striking when compared to the related MERS PLpro, since they are structurally similar and share 52% amino acid sequence homology (B\u00e1ez-Santos et al., 2014). While SARS PLpro efficiently cleaves higher-molecular-weight (HMW) polyUbLys48 conjugates, it exhibits poor activity in cleavage assays using free diUb chains or mono- or di-ubiquitinated substrates, such as I\u03baB\u03b1 (Figure 1A). These data supported a model whereby SARS PLpro uses distal Ub binding site (S2) to recognize diUbLys48 across S2-S1 (Figure 1B), rather than across S1-S1\u2032, as is typical for most DUBs.",

The distal diUb-ABP bears an isosteric non-hydrolyzable triazole linker in lieu of the native isopeptide linkage (Figure S2B). In labeling assays with SARS PLpro (Figure 1E), the distal diUbLys48-ABP (green) reacted well, monoUb-ABP (orange) reacted slowly, and the in-between diUbLys48-ABP (red) reacted poorly, and quantification shows distal diUbLys48-ABP adduct forms most efficiently in comparison to other probes (Figures 1F and S2C). The observation that SARS PLpro formed adducts least efficiently with the in-between diUbLys48-ABP probe (compare to monoUb-ABP), suggests that it might bind the in-between diUbLys48-ABP via S2-S1, preventing it from binding and reacting via S1-S1\u2032 interactions (Figure S2D). Importantly, the in-between diUbLys48-ABP efficiently labels other DUBs that do not exhibit diUb preferences (Figures S2E and S2F). With the ideal reagent in hand, we set out to determine the structural basis for diUbLys48 recognition by SARS PLpro.",

To query if displacement could be due to the triazole linkage, our diUb structure was compared to Lys48-linked diUb (PDB 1AAR) revealing that amino acids 51\u201357 adopt a similar conformation to that observed in Lys48-linked diUb (Figure S3F), despite dissimilar S2Ub conformations (Figures 2B and S3G).",

Non-conservative substitutions of a cluster of residues in SARS PLpro that are in proximity to the S2Ub-Ile44 hydrophobic patch (e.g., SARS PLpro F70S/E71K/H74G) or individual substitutions F70S and H74G greatly reduce Ub chain cleaving activity by SARS PLpro, as assayed on pentaUbLys48 (Figure 3\nA, top, green; Figure S4B) and tetraUbLys48 (Figure S4C). In contrast, SARS PLpro N178A/E180K and E180K substitutions, residues that contact S2Ub-Lys11, have a less pronounced effect on pentaUbLys48 (Figure 3A, top, green; Figure S4B) or tetraUbLys48 (Figure S4C). These data suggest the importance of distal S2Ub contacts, as the S1Ub binding surface remains intact in these mutants. Further supporting a dominant role for S2Ub interactions is the observation that mutation of residues surrounding the S1Ub-Ile44 patch have a modest effect compared to S2Ub-Ile44-disrupting mutations for pentaUbLys48 (Figure 3A, bottom, blue; Figure S4B) and tetraUbLys48 (Figure S4C) especially the M209S, R167S, R167S/E168R mutants. The E168R mutant, and a helix-swap mutant that replaces SARS residues with those in MERS PLpro (R167S/E168R+helix), have somewhat diminished activities. And while the N178A/E180K (S2Ub-contacting via Lys11) and R167S/E168R+helix mutants (S1Ub-contacting via Gln49/Arg42) display diminished polyUb cleaving ability, their defects are less than that observed for the F70S/E71K/H74G (S2Ub-contacting via Ile44) mutant.

As expected, the SARS PLpro S2Ub mutant (F70S/E71K/H74G) exhibits diminished activity against tetraUbLys48 (Figure 3C, top) yet retains WT-level activity on diUbLys48 (Figure 3C, bottom). Thus, S2Ub recognition is dispensable for diUbLys48 cleavage, consistent with an S1-S1\u2032 binding mode being relevant for diUbLys48 cleavage. In contrast, the S1Ub mutant (R167S/E168R+helix) has diminished diUbLys48 cleavage activity yet retains the ability to cleave tetraUbLys48 chains with characteristic accumulation of diUb intermediates (Figure 3C). Single point mutants of the composite mutants (F70S for S2Ub, E168R for S1Ub) exhibit similar cleavage profiles (Figure S4C). These results suggest that mutations predicted to disrupt S1Ub recognition do not prevent cleavage of tetraUbLys48 when an intact S2Ub binding surface is present. As earlier, mutations within SARS PLpro predicted to disrupt contacts to S2Ub near Lys11 have a modest effect on tetraUbLys48 cleavage, and combining mutations designed to disrupt both S2Ub-Ile44 and -Lys11 patches are not additive (data not shown). Additionally, mutations designed to disrupt contacts to S2Ub, alone or in combination, do not display gain-of-function activity toward diUbLys48, suggesting that disrupting S2Ub interaction does not convert SARS PLpro into a DUB with stronger preference for S1-S1\u2032 binding.",

            "text": "To quantify the contribution of S2Ub and S1Ub contacts with respect to diUbLys48 recognition by SARS PLpro, we turned to recently developed fluorogenic model diUbLys48-AMC substrates (containing a triazole-linker between Ub moieties), where the AMC fluorophore is conjugated to the proximal end of diUbLys48 (Flierman et al., 2016), enabling kinetic characterization of SARS PLpro by monitoring fluorescence during hydrolysis of the -AMC amide bond. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of monoUb- and diUbLys48-AMC cleavage by SARS PLpro and its selected S2Ub and S1Ub mutants reveals that SARS PLpro cleaves the diUbLys48-AMC about \u223c37-fold more efficiently than it cleaves monoUb-AMC (Figure 3E, black and red, respectively; Table 2\n, compare apparent kcat/KM values of 3.3E+04 M\u22121s\u22121 for monoUb-AMC to 1.26E+06 M\u22121s\u22121 for diUbLys48-AMC). Moreover, kinetic comparison of SARS PLpro mutants reveals that loss of S2 interactions (F70S/E71K/H74G; Figure 3E, green; Table 2) results in an \u223c33-fold loss of catalytic efficiency (kcat and KM could not be measured independently, and the S2 mutant could not be saturated by the diUbLys48-AMC substrate, indicative of a binding defect). Thus, the S2 mutant converts SARS PLpro into an S1-dependent, monoUb-based DUB. In contrast, mutation of either the hydrophobic interaction in the S1Ub site (M209S, Figure 3E, light blue; Table 2) or polar contacts to S1Ub (R167S/E168R, Figure 3E, dark blue; Table 2) results in a modest decrease in catalytic efficiency, an effect mainly driven by a 2- to 3-fold increase in KM without a corresponding loss in kcat (Table 2). Assaying additional point mutants at a single monoUb- or diUbLys48-AMC substrate concentration mirrors these trends (Figure S4D, top). Importantly, S2 mutants do not exhibit diminished monoUb-AMC cleavage rates (Figure S4D, bottom), consistent with gel-based experiments, as they maintained activity when processing diUbLys48 into monoUb.",

To test if the triazole linkage is a good functional mimic of the native isopeptide-bond, we generated a native isopeptide-linked diUbLys48-AMC reagent (Figure S4F) and assayed initial cleavage rates for triazole-linked and native diUbLys48-AMC substrates (Figure S4G).

Although dynamic, diUb conformations can be stabilized by interactions between Ub molecules, sometimes templated by their interacting partners (Ye et al., 2012). Linkage specificity for most DUBs characterized thus far is determined by contacts across the protease active site with diUb occupying S1-S1\u2019 sites (Keusekotten et al., 2013, Mevissen et al., 2013, Sato et al., 2008, Sato et al., 2015). As shown previously, SARS PLpro is poor at cleaving diUb and does not strictly require a specific linkage across S1-S1\u2032 (B\u00e9k\u00e9s et al., 2015). Given the extended conformation of diUbLys48 observed in complex with SARS PLpro and the paucity of contacts to the diUbLys48 linkage (Figure 2C), we hypothesized that SARS PLpro might indirectly sense linkage specificity by requiring that diUb occupies both S2Ub and S1Ub sites, a requirement that would place limits on the type of chain that could be accommodated because of differences in chain topology and distance between individual Ub molecules relative to the two Ub binding sites.",

Although not as efficient as diUbLys48-ABP, diUbLys27-ABP exhibited better labeling efficiency compared other linkage-specific diUb-ABPs, which reacted at levels similar to monoUb-ABP (Figure 4\nA and S5A). Since covalent activity-based probes are very reactive, we also tested linkage-specific diUb-AMC substrates by analyzing initial cleavage rates by SARS PLpro. These results suggest that SARS PLpro activity is highly restricted to diUbLys48-AMC cleavage (Figures 4B and S5B) as diUbLys48-AMC is cleaved \u223c100-fold faster compared to other linkages. Each chain-forming residue in S1Ub is available for conjugation in our diUbLys48-SARS PLpro complex (Figure 4C), but the distance between S1Ub-Lys48 and the SARS-Phe70 S2Ub binding site is closest (26 \u00c5) with each of the other sites requiring an additional 10 to 15 \u00c5 to span between the conjugated lysine and S2Ub binding site (Figure S5C). This raised the possibility that linkage-specificity across S2-S1 is enforced by restricting access to other topologies by requiring that SARS PLpro read the distance between diUb Ile44 hydrophobic patches via S2-S1 (Figure 2B), a requirement that is only satisfied by chains carrying Lys48 linkages. Accordingly, assaying homotypic linkage-specific tetra-ubiquitin (tetraUb) chains in endpoint cleavage assays also confirmed SARS PLpro to be Lys48-specific (Figure 4D).",

            "text": "To determine if a Lys48-linkage was also preferred across S1-S1\u2032 (Figure 4E), we assayed SARS PLpro and its S2Ub-Ile44 mutant (F70S/E71K/H74G) for cleavage of homotypic Lys48- and Lys63-linked tetraUb chains and a mixed linkage tetraUb chain consisting of two Lys48-linked dimers linked by Lys63 (see schematics in Figure 4F). This latter mixed chain could be recognized by SARS PLpro in S2-S1, but its cleavage would require accommodation of a Lys63-linkage across S1-S1\u2032. A time course reveals that SARS PLpro readily cleaves homotypic Lys48 tetraUb chains but is inactive on homotypic Lys63 tetraUb chains. Interestingly, the mixed chain is cleaved when the Lys63 linkage is presented across S1-S1\u2032, but only when an intact S2 site is present (Figure 4G). Initial cleavage rates (Figure 4H) show that SARS PLpro is \u223c5-fold slower in cleaving the mixed chain compared to the homotypic Lys48-linked chain, suggesting some specificity for a Lys48 linkage across S1-S1\u2032. More importantly, the S2Ub-Ile44 mutant exhibits faster cleavage rates on homotypic Lys48 chains than on mixed or on homotypic Lys63-linked chains (Figures 4G and 4H). Taken together, these data suggest a measurable specificity for Lys48 across S1-S1\u2032, even when diUbLys48 recognition via S2-S1 is compromised. Thus, Lys48-specificity of SARS PLpro is enforced by S2-S1 recognition but complemented by a preference for Lys48 linkages across S1-S1\u2032, suggesting that SARS PLpro would be most active on polyUbLys48 chains. Consistent with the hypothesis of S2-S1-S1\u2032 recognition of polyUbLys48 chains, di- and monoUb-conjugated I\u03baB\u03b1 accumulates during cleavage by SARS PLpro (Figure 1D, I\u03baB\u03b1), while unmodified I\u03baB\u03b1 remains static (Figure 1D, lighter exposure I\u03baB\u03b1). These data suggest that SARS PLpro acts efficiently on polyUbLys48 chains in a diUb-dependent manner yet generates mono- and diUb-conjugated substrate remnants that may no longer represent its preferred substrate.",

We identified two residues, W107 and A108, adjacent to the exit tunnel of the SARS PLpro active site and mutated them to residues observed in MERS PLpro (Figure S5D). Cleavage assays with this putative S1\u2032 mutant reveals that W107L/A108S has diminished activity on triUbLys48, which requires interactions with S2-S1-S1\u2032 (Figures S5E and S5F), but exhibits no significant loss of activity when cleaving diUbLys48-AMC, a substrate that is solely dependent on S2-S1 (Figure S5F). This mutant, however, loses activity on Ub-AMC and ISG15-AMC (whose recognition is primarily S1 dependent). Combined with the observation that a Lys48-linked isopeptide is preferred as a substrate, these data suggest that S1\u2032-dependent recognition of Lys48-linkages by SARS PLpro is possible, although additional work will be required to explore this hypothesis.",

            "text": "The activity of SARS PLpro on ISG15 has been shown to be dependent on the distal Ubl within ISG15 (Lindner et al., 2007). Because the S2 binding site is important for diUbLys48 cleavage as described here and as proposed previously (Ratia et al., 2014), we sought to directly compare mutations in S2 and S1 of SARS PLpro and their impact on ISG15 cleavage activity. SARS PLpro S1Ub and S2Ub mutants were used to cleave ISG15-AMC using Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Figure 5\nA). Mutations have contrasting effects for ISG15-AMC cleavage (Figure 5A; Table 2). The S1 polar mutant (Figure 5A, dark blue) exhibits greater defects for ISG15-AMC cleavage with minimal effects diUbLys48-AMC cleavage. In contrast, the S2 mutant exhibits major defects for diUbLys48-AMC cleavage with less severe defects in ISG15-AMC cleavage. To confirm these differential effects, we utilized lysates prepared from IFN\u03b2/MG132-treated cells that contained polyUbLys48 chains and ISG15-conjugated substrates and added recombinant SARS PLpro mutants (Figure 5B). Analyzing loss of HMW polyUbLys48-conjugates and the appearance of free ISG15, indicative of cleavage of ISGylated substrates, reveals contrasting effects for S2 and S1 mutants (Figure 5C). While the S2 mutant compromises polyUbLys48 chain, but not ISG15 cleavage, the S1 mutant has the opposite effect. Finally, we compared other SARS PLpro mutants for cleavage of diUbLys48-AMC and ISG15-AMC (Figure S6B). Overall, S2Ub site mutants (green) show minimal loss of ISG15-AMC cleavage activity, while S1Ub mutants (blue), particularly those containing the E168R mutation, have a pronounced loss-of-function effect. Thus, ISG15 recognition appears more dependent on interactions within S1 and perhaps an alternative S2, while diUbLys48 recognition is more dependent on contacts within S2. It is difficult to rationalize these effects in the absence of a structure of ISG15 bound to SARS PLpro, but it appears clear that ISG15 recognition differs in details when compared to diUbLys48 recognition (Figure S6C).",

Coupled with mutational, biochemical and kinetic data, our structure helps to explain the strict Lys48-linkage specificity exhibited by this viral DUB, which is primarily enforced by engaging the diUb module within S2-S1, and enhanced by a slight preference for Lys48-linked Ub across S1-S1\u2032 (Figure 5D).

This mode of Ub chain recognition has only been reported for the catalytic core of OTUD2, where an additional binding site mediates interaction with a Lys11-linked diUb (Mevissen et al., 2013). Through modeling, mutational analysis, and the crystal structure of a monoUb-bound SARS PLpro, the Mesecar group suggested that SARS PLpro is an S2-S1 mode DUB (Ratia et al., 2014) and that the distal Ub would be recognized by a hydrophobic surface in SARS PLpro, involving Phe70. Our current study illuminates the structural basis for this interaction. We provide biochemical evidence that the S2Ub interface has a dominant role in diUbLys48 recognition and polyUb chain cleaving activity, since mutating the distal S2Ub recognition surface is more detrimental than disrupting the proximal S1Ub recognition surface. We also provide evidence that SARS PLpro Lys48-specificity is complemented by a preference for Lys48-linked chains across S1-S1\u2032.",

Indeed, cleavage of Lys48-linked polyUb chains from I\u03baB\u03b1 by SARS PLpro led to an increase in di- and monoUb-conjugated forms of I\u03baB\u03b1. Whether SARS PLpro cleaves other polyUbLys48-conjugated substrates to di- or monoUb-conjugated forms remains to be determined. Mono-ubiquitination at membranes and at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been shown to regulate endocytosis and vesicle trafficking (Clague et al., 2012), which are also involved in coronavirus propagation.

With mutations described herein, which bias activities in deubiquitination versus deISGylation, it may be possible to discern if both activities are important during SARS infection. With that said, it is worth noting that SARS viral titer levels peak at 16\u201320 hr in cell culture and in mouse model infection studies (Channappanavar et al., 2016, Totura and Baric, 2012), while interferon (IFN)-responsive genes, such as ISG15, are only induced later during infection (Channappanavar et al., 2016). As such, it is likely that the virus has already achieved its full replicative potential before SARS PLpro would encounter ISG15. Additionally, the function of substrate-conjugated ISG15 in anti-viral immunity in humans is now in question (Bogunovic et al., 2012), as a non-conjugatable form of ISG15 was shown to have similar activities as WT ISG15, likely via stabilization of USP18 (Zhang et al., 2015). Given the preference for polyUbLys48 and diUbLys48 over ISG15, it appears likely that polyUbLys48-conjugated substrates are the primary cellular targets of SARS PLpro. These observations suggest that SARS PLpro activities against ISG15 targets may not be as relevant for coronavirus infection as previously thought.",
