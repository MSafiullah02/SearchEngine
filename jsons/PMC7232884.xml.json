            "text": "The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), occurring from a severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like coronavirus started in Wuhan, China, is spreading\nrapidly in humans, which is now considered as a global pandemic (Lu et al., 2020). WHO, on 30 January 2020, declared this\noutbreak as Public Health Emergency of International Concern and later on 11 February 2020\nnamed it as COVID-19 (\u201cCoronavirus (COVID-19) events as they happen,\u201d 2020). According to the data of WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports),\ncurrently (as on 24th April 2020), more than 2.6 million COVID-19 cases have been\nconfirmed globally, and the number of death toll rose to 1,81,938 which are increasing\nexponentially. To date no specific medications have been developed, and therefore\nconsidering the risk factors associated with this disease, there is an urgent need for a\ntreatment method to treat this disease in order to limit the transmission (Enayatkhani\net al., 2020). Among all the treatment\nstrategies, the uses of already known viral medications have great advantages as the\npharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety profiles of these drugs have already been\nestablished. This drug repurposing strategy has gained significance as they are expected to\nbe faster with less investment (Fitchett et al., 2014; Law et al., 2013; Pant et al.,\n2020; Park, 2019). Preliminary studies revealed Lopinavir/ritonavir combined therapy as a\npotential inhibitor of the virus. Along with these two drugs, many other antiviral drugs\nhave also been screened (Lu, 2020; Y. Wang\net al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Recently, anti-malarial drug chloroquine (M. Wang et al.,\n2020) and hydroxychloroquine (Gautret et al.,\n2020) have been reported to have certain curative effect on COVID-19. Due to diverse\nbioactivity and less toxicity, naturally occurring bioactive flavonoid molecules have also\nbeen screened for their potential therapeutic effects (Khaerunnisa et al., 2020; Thuy et al., 2020). Numerous reports to identify the potential inhibitors of novel\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) have recently been published using computational methods (Aanouz\net al., 2020; Elmezayen et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020). The\ntranscription of the genomic RNA inside the cell generates a polypeptide which is\nproteolytically cleaved by the main protease (MPro which is also known as\n3CLPro or chymotrypsin-like protease) at 11 different sites to produce proteins\nnecessary for the replication of the virus. Inhibition of the activity of the main protease\nis expected to block the viral replication as no human proteases are known having similar\ncleavage specificity (Boopathi et al., 2020;\nZhang et al., 2020). Therefore MPro is\none of the most explored drug target among the corona viruses that plays a major role in the\ntranslation and replication of new generation viruses from the viral genomic RNA (Morse\net al., 2020; Wu et al., 2006). Many crystal structures of MPro of SARS-CoV-2 have\nalready been submitted to protein data bank (PDB) which are in both liganded and unbounded\nform (Jin et al., 2020; Owen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The 3 D structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID.\n6Y84), is made up of three domains, where domain I, II and III spans across 8-101, 102-184\nand 201-306 amino acid residues, repectively. Domain I and II mainly consists of \u03b2-barrels\nwhile domain III mainly consists of \u03b1-helices (S. A. Khan et al., 2020). The substrate/active site of binding is located at the cleft\nof domain I and II, which consists of two catalytic residues, namely, HIS41 and CYS145\n(Figure 1).",

Ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, penciclovir\nand lopinavir are known drugs that have been screened for the treatment of COVID-19. The\nreason for them being used as control drugs in the study is that, as mentioned earlier,\nlopinavir/ritonavir combination, and anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine has recently been\nfound to be a potential inhibitor of the virus, while penciclovir could also inhibit the\nvirus to some extent (M. Wang et al., 2020).\nConsidering the diverse pharmaceutical properties of the natural products including\nanti-viral properties (Jo et al., 2020; Thayil\n& Thyagarajan, 2016; Zakaryan et al., 2017), a total of 17 compounds: curcumin,\ndemethoxycurcumin, (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin, (EGC),\nhesperidin, myricitrin, puerarin, scutellarin, rutin, quercitrin, capsaicin, ursolic acid,\nglabridin, apiin, rhoifolin, glycyrrhizin, and vitexin were screened for their inhibitory\npotential against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Azidothymidine, indinavir, tipranavir, and\nsaquinavir are the well-known anti-viral drugs (De Clercq & Li, 2016), while diethylcarbamazine, primaquine, mepacrine, artemisinin\nand niclosamide are the anti-nematodes (Panic et al., 2014) and emetine, an anti-protozoal drug (Akinboye & Bakare, 2011), which have also been screened for their\ninhibitory potentials. Further, two anti-fungals, namely, fluconazole and itraconazole\n(Vardakas et al., 2005) were also docked to the\nmain protease of COVID-19. This study is focused on the repurposing/identification of\ncompounds with a sole aim to expedite the identification of specific drugs for the treatment\nof COVID-19.",

The docked poses clearly demonstrate that the drugs molecules bind\nwithin the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro macromolecular structure. Figure 2a shows that penciclovir binds firmly through\nthree conventional hydrogen bonds with residues HIS41, CYS44 and GLU166 besides other\ninteractions such as carbon-hydrogen bonds (ASN142 and MET165) and van der Waals\ninteractions. Ritonavir binds to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 with different types of\nnon-covalent interactions, as depicted in Figure\n2b. Ritonavir stabilizes in the active site through hydrogen bonding with THR25\nand SER46, \u03c0-sigma with THR26, alkyl hydrophobic with MET165, \u03c0-alkyl hydrophobic with\nLEU27, CYS145 and PRO168, and van der Waals interactions with other residues as depicted\nin the 2 D plot. Hydroxychloroquine, a promising candidate for the treatment of the\ncurrent pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 (Gautret et al., 2020), has been found to bind within\nthe active site of the protease through \u03c0-sulphur interaction with MET165, \u03c0-sigma with\nGLN189, alkyl hydrophobic with LEU167 and PRO168, and van der Waals interactions with\nother residues as shown in Figure 2c. Similarly,\nlopinavir interacts with the residues in the active site through hydrogen bonding with\nTHR26, \u03c0-sulphur interaction with CYS145 and alkyl hydrophobic with PRO168, besides van\nder Waals interaction with other residues as depicted in the 2 D plot (Figure 2d). The fullfitness score along with the\nestimated free energy (\u0394G) of binding of the above mentioned drugs are\nlisted in Table 1. If we compare in terms of the\n\u0394G value, we can see that ritonavir has the most negative\n\u0394G value with - 9.52 kcal/mol followed by lopinavir, then\nhydroxychloroquine and finally penciclovir. This can be directly correlated with the\nnumber of non-covalent interactions that these drugs undergo with the surrounding residues\nwithin the active site of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the stability of a particular drug within\nthe active site is also associated with the number of \u03c0-interactions that it undergoes\nwith the surrounding residues (Arthur & Uzairu, 2019). The electrostatic surface potential of the binding site along with the\nsimultaneous presence of the four drugs are shown in Figure S2.",

Inhibition of this enzyme/protease is essential for blocking the viral\nreplication (Zhang et al., 2020). This\ninhibitor binding site within the protease of SARS-CoV-2 consists of residues HIS41,\nMET49, GLY143, CYS145, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189 as evident from the\nrecent study on the \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Zhang et al.,\n2020). We observe from the blind docking\nstudy of all the 33 molecules with the SARS-CoV-2 protease that the molecules are\ngenerally surrounded by the above mentioned residues, which clearly suggests that this\nmolecule can prevent the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. The distance of the ligands\nalong with the change in accessible area of the two important catalytic residues (HIS41\nand CYS145) within the active site of the protease is shown in Table 2. Although the blind docking studies indicates that all the\nmolecules can act as potential agents for COVID treatments, but from the estimated free\nenergy of binding (\u0394G) values (Table\n1), we can infer that rutin with the highest negative minimum \u0394G\nvalue (\u22129.55 kcal/mol) among all the studied compounds can be the best possible SARS-CoV-2\ninhibitor, followed by ritonavir (\u22129.52 kcal/mol), emetine (\u22129.07 kcal/mol), hesperidin\n(\u22129.02 kcal/mol), and indinavir (\u22128.84 kcal/mol).",

            "text": "The emergence of novel viruses requires efficient therapeutic strategies to develop or\nidentify drugs that can treat the disease or control the further spread of the virus. In\nrecent years, molecules that influence the life cycle of viruses have been identified, and\na broad range of anti-viral agents have been proposed, which includes inhibiting the entry\nand stopping of viral replication or targeting intracellular signal transduction pathways\n(Elfiky & Azzam, 2020; Hasan et al., 2020). In this context, repurposing of already\nknown drugs and molecules is an essential concept (R. J. Khan et al., 2020), especially in the pandemic that has resulted\ndue to the novel coronavirus, as it is cost-effective in terms of research and development\nof new novel drug molecules. Sir James Black, the recipient of the 1988 Nobel Prize in\nPhysiology and Medicine, had famously stated that \u201cThe most fruitful basis for the\ndiscovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug\u201d. In addition to the FDA approved\ndrugs, here we observed that rutin and hesperidin, two dietary polyphenols have\nsignificant potential to function as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Dietary\npolyphenols have low systemic toxicity and are highly beneficial for human health (Cory\net al., 2018). Rutin, also known as vitamin P,\nhas several pharmacological properties including anti-viral activity (Ganeshpurkar &\nSaluja, 2017). Similarly, hesperidin has also\nbeen observed to act as an anti-viral compound (Parvez et al., 2019). Therefore, this finding also indicates a promising potential\nfor the use of dietary polyphenols for the treatment of COVID-19.",

We observe that\nthe studied bind within the active site of the 6Y84, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which\nis essential for preventing the protein mutarotation of the virus by inhibiting the viral\nreplication, and further spread of the infection. The estimated free energy of binding\nvaried in the range of -6.57 to -9.55 kcal/mol, suggesting the molecules can spontaneously\ninteract within the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Among all the molecules, the\ninhibition activity of rutin was found to be the highest as its \u0394G value\n(\u22129.55 kcal/mol) is the minimum, followed by ritonavir (\u22129.52 kcal/mol), emetine\n(\u22129.07 kcal/mol), hesperidin (\u22129.02 kcal/mol), and indinavir (\u22128.84 kcal/mol).
