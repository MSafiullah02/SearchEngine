No respiratory symptoms or abnormal chest radiograph findings were present. The patient was successfully treated with intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 h for 21 days). After completion of acyclovir treatment, the patient developed a febrile nonproductive cough without dyspnea. A chest radiograph showed bilateral interstitial syndrome, and this was confirmed by a CT scan, which showed disseminated micronodular opacities. Arterial blood gas values while breathing in room air were normal. Other laboratory findings were as follows: WBC count, 2100 cells/mm3, with 1600 polymorphonuclear cells and 500 lymphocytes; platelet count, 20,000 platelets/mm3. Liver enzyme levels were normal. Sputum samples were negative for Legionella species when subjected to direct immunofluorescence, and bacterial culture of the sputum samples showed no growth. Results of tests of serum samples for Aspergillus galactomannan antigen were also negative. Following failure of empirical antibiotic treatment (piperacillin and ciprofloxacin), fiber-optic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in the middle lobe. Cytological analysis of specimens of the BAL fluid showed 290 nucleated cells/mm3, with 18% polymorphonuclear cells, 40% macrophages, and 42% lymphocytes (identified as T-cell lymphocytes by flow cytometry analysis [37% CD4+ cells and 50% CD8+ cells]). The findings of extensive microbiological direct examinations and cultures remained negative for bacteria; mycobacteria; fungi; and parasites, such as Pneumocystis carinii. The results of immunofluorescent assays for multiple respiratory viruses (respiratory syncitial virus [RSV]; parainfluenza viruses I, II, and III; adenovirus; and influenzae viruses A and B) and herpes viruses (herpes simplex virus [HSV], VZV), and immunoperoxydase staining for cytomegalovirus (CMV) were negative in specimens of BAL fluid.

The results of blood tests for Aspergillus galactomannan and CMV pp65 antigens remained negative. Specimens obtained by BAL performed in the lingular region were hemorrhagic, and the findings of a quantitative cytological examination were noncontributive, because of numerous lysed cells. The findings of extensive research to detect the presence of microorganisms (bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, parasites, CMV, and RSV) were negative. Despite aggressive supportive care with mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and high-dose norepinephrine infusion, refractory hypoxia rapidly led to fatal multiorgan failure. No autopsy was performed. Cultures of BAL fluid specimens remained negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. The same procedures for viral culture and RT-PCR were applied as in case study 1, described above.

In the case of the first patient, the main differential diagnosis was VZV-associated pneumonia, which is the most frequent complication of varicella in adults and is usually concomitant to cutaneous vesicles.

Bacterial etiology is largely predominant in ventilator-associated pneumonia, but CMV has been identified as a possible cause in adult patients, and outbreaks of coronavirus- and adenovirus-related pneumonia in pediatric ICUs have been described [10\u201312]. In the case we describe, though negative results of bacteriological cultures cannot exclude a bacterial origin, a secondary identification of coronavirus in BAL fluid specimens provided a high probability that a diagnosis of viral origin was accurate.",

These methods include identification of corona-like particles, immunofluorescent assays with monoclonal antibodies, and RNA hybridization in fluid specimens from nasal washing or BAL [13\u201315]. Detection of seroconversion, based on ELISA findings, may be useful, but it does not allow rapid virus-identification and only provides a retrospective diagnosis [16]. We identified coronavirus in both patients because the BAL specimens were cultured in the human hepatoma HUH7 cell line, which expresses a specific receptor for coronaviruses [17]. Recent advances in virological detection methods, such as molecular amplification techniques, offer promising perspectives for detection of coronaviruses [18]. Indeed, improved sensitivity and specificity have been obtained with molecular detection methods combining RT-PCR with strain-specific primers derived from the M protein gene, followed by molecular hybridization with specific probes recognizing either coronavirus 229E or OC43 [9]. Inversely, the high sensitivity of amplification methods may lead to false-positive results caused by contamination of BAL fluid specimens with pharyngeal viruses. Therefore, the combination of viral culture and RT-PCR of BAL fluid samples appears to be an efficient and reliable diagnostic strategy.",

            "text": "Two coronavirus strains, 229E and OC43, have previously been related to human diseases with various clinical syndromes, ranging from self-resolving common cold to pneumonia [2\u20135]. Recently, the worldwide outbreak of SARS was linked to a novel coronavirus that had not been previously identified in human beings or animals [6]. The clinical features of SARS combine flu-like symptoms, dry cough, and shortness of breath, associated with pulmonary infiltrates visible by chest radiography. In contrast to the common benign symptoms of coronavirus infections in healthy individuals, a large proportion of patients with SARS have severe respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support in the ICU. The impact of a respiratory virus on individuals is largely determined by their underlying conditions, and particularly by whether they are experiencing immunosuppression [19, 20]. The prevalence of coronavirus pulmonary infections among immunocompromised patients is unknown, and it is probably largely underestimated in the absence of the routine performance of sensitive cell culture, RT-PCR, or electron microscopy on BAL fluid specimens. However, RT-PCR results were negative for coronaviruses in the BAL samples of 46 HSCT recipients with acute pulmonary infiltrates [21]. Thus, only 1 case of coronavirus-associated pneumonia was previously described in an immunocompromised patient following autologous bone marrow transplantation, with the diagnosis based on the presence of viral particles in BAL fluid specimens [22]. The identification of coronavirus in high-risk immunocompromised patients may lead to early adoption of a specific therapeutic strategy, but, in the absence of proof of the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the treatment remains only symptomatic. In these circumstances, different types of IFNs that display antiviral properties against coronaviruses may be evaluated [23, 24].",
