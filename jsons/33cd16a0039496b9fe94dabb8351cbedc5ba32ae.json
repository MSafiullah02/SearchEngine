The permeability of parts of a FFP2 mask was measured before and after six cleanings with ethanol. As for any porous medium, the filtering properties of a mask are related to the size and tortuosity of the pores of the filter, and are quantified by its permeability. Any damage to the filter will change its permeability. We show here that after six cleaning cycles, the permeability remains very close to the permeability before cleaning. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of protective masks, this study suggests that ethanol could be used to sanitize a FFP2 mask without significantly altering its filtering properties. Additional measurements on FFP2 and N95 masks from different manufacturers need to be performed to validate this study.",

            "text": "Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of protective masks, many essential workers have had to rely on a limited number of protective masks. As the pandemic progresses, portions of the population have been asked to wear masks while in public spaces (1) , thereby increasing the demand for protective masks. These masks are made of polyester and other synthetic fibers, acting as a filter to capture droplets while inhaling and exhaling. Importantly they are designed for single use. In this study, we asked the following question: does the sanitization of a FFP2 mask with 99% ethyl alcohol alter its filtering properties? We hypothesize that the sanitization of a mask with ethyl alcohol between uses would reduce transmission of pathogens such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Like any porous media, the filtering property of a mask is related to the size and tortuosity of the pores of the filter, a property that can be quantified by a permeability measurement. The permeability of a porous media is a measure of the ability of a fluid to pass through it (2) . A highly permeable material provides low resistance to the fluid passing through it, whereas a material with low permeability provides more resistance to flow. If the porous media, such as the filter, is altered by the sanitization process, then the permeability of the mask would change. FFP2 masks, and their US equivalent N95, are required to meet certain standards of filtering. These standards are not directly defined by the permeability of the filter, but on the ability of the filter to stop aerosol when subjected to a certain airflow. The study described herein did not assess aerosol filtering, and therefore does not guarantee that the FFP2 mask will perform as expected regarding aerosol filtering ability. However, aerosol filtering is the consequence of two effects, the permeability of the filter, which we show here remains unchanged, and the wettability of the fibers, which we argue below should not be altered by ethanol. Furthermore we have tested masks from only one manufacturer; and the sanitization protocol employed in this study (1 hour soaking in 99% grade ethanol) has not been optimized to eradicate microbes and viruses. For comparison, we also measured the permeability of a \"homemade\" fabric mask meeting the French standard AFNOR (3) and found the mask 4 to 8 times more permeable (offering less resistance to flow, therefore less filtering) than a FFP2 mask.",

To meet the FFP2 standard, a mask needs to be able to separate at least 94% of airborne aerosols that pass through the filter at 95 L/min air flow. Other requirements in the EN 149-2001 standard, relative to the pressure drop under certain airflow, are directly related to the permeability of the filter. The European FFP2 masks have very similar filtering capabilities to the American N95 masks. The N95 mask corresponds to the US NIOSH-42C FR84 standard, and must be able to filter at least 95% of aerosols at a flow rate of 85 L/min.

Experimental setup Permeability measurements were performed using a custom-designed flow permeameter (Figure 2) . A 2 cm 2 section of a FFP2 mask was compressed between a flat rubber seal (5 mm height) and a ceramic plate using a press. The pressure applied by the press was adjusted to limit side leaks. The thickness of the mask was approximately 1 mm. Airflow was regulated by an air pump, and the fluid used was air. Outlet pressure was atmospheric pressure. Pressures in the inlet and the flow rates were recorded using a 16-bit acquisition board and the software CYDAR (6) . The experimental set-up was similar to the one described in Lenormand et al.

The compressibility of air was taken into account in the analysis. Due to the high permeability of the mask, the pressure drop across the mask was on the same order as the pressure drop in the tubing and end-pieces of the permeameter. Therefore, we initially performed a pressure vs. flow rate measurement of the apparatus, without the mask in place. A second measurement was then performed with the mask in place. The pressure drop due to the mask was calculated as the difference between both curves (Figure 3) . The pressure curve without mask (and consequently also the raw data) follows a quadratic equation, due to inertial effects. However the corrected curve is a linear function and therefore follows Darcy's law (Equation 1 ). At maximum flow rate, the Reynolds number was estimated to be Re = 0.016. The Reynolds number in the filter was small compared to 1, and the flow is laminar with no inertial effects. .

After six cleaning cycles, the permeability remained very close to the permeability before cleaning; the standard deviations between all measurements were 0.66 Darcy for disk 1 and 0.80 Darcy for disk 2. Differences between measurements could arise from the difficulty of repositioning the rubber seal at the exact location from one measurement to the next. Also, measurements on disk 1 and disk 2 were performed on the same mask, showing the spatial heterogeneities of the filtering media. The variability in permeability resulting from one measurement to the next was less than the variability arising from different area of the mask. Measurements performed on the barrier mask showed a permeability of 48 Darcy, or 1.6 L / (min mbar cm 2 ).

Measurements were performed on masks from only one manufacturer, therefore it is not established whether or not the results presented here can be extrapolated to masks from different manufacturers. Furthermore, this study did not assess the aerosol filtration directly, as defined in the EN 149:2001 performance standard. However it is highly probable that the aerosol filtration properties remain unchanged after ethanol cleaning for two reasons. First, the permeability measurements demonstrated that the pore structure of the filter was unchanged by the sanitization protocol. Secondly, ethanol cleaning is not expected to change the wettability of the filter. The filter should remain hydrophilic; water wettability is necessary to retain the aerosol droplets. However, this assumption should be confirmed by a laboratory that is capable of performing the appropriate aerosol tests. Finally, the sanitization protocol used here, a 1 hour soak in 99% ethanol, was not optimized to eradicate microbes and viruses. We assumed that ethanol would be a likely candidate for such usage, as it is mostly safe and widely available. The Centers For Disease Control proposes several sanitization protocols using ethanol (8) .
