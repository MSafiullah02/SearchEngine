Higher expression of TLR2 and/or TLR4 and up\u2010regulation of inflammatory factors have been observed in macrophages in vitro infected by some viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),6, 7, 8 influenza virus,9 hepatitis C virus (HCV),4 hepatitis B virus (HBV),10 severe acute respiratory syndrome virus11 and several herpes viruses.12, 13, 14 TLR2 and/or TLR4 have also been involved in the induction of high inflammatory responses during acute viral infections.

For reasons that are not well understood, few cases of acute infections progress into fulminant hepatic failure, characterized by extensive necrosis and hepatocellular dysfunction, exacerbated inflammation and high mortality rate.19 Hepatic lesions occurring during viral infections are primarily related to virally triggered host inflammatory responses (reviewed in ref. 20) and depend on a poorly elucidated balance between innate immune cell\u2013virus interactions and the control of viral replication that is critical in the outcome of hepatitis. The contribution of TLR2 in antiviral defences and inflammatory responses during acute hepatic viral infections is unknown and needs investigation.",

In addition, the intrahepatic tolerance sustained by IL\u20104, IL\u201010, TGF\u2010\u03b2 and prostaglandin E2 is also disturbed.32 In contrast, it has been suggested that macrophages would rather contribute to the lower gravity of hepatitis and viral clearance during MHV\u2010A59 infection, presumably through a rapid type 1 IFN\u2010dependent suppression of viral replication.33 It was demonstrated that the induction of IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in peritoneal macrophages infected by MHV3 depended on the fixation of the viral surface (S) protein to TLR2.34 Previous in vivo studies also revealed higher levels of IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 in livers from MHV3\u2010infected C57BL/6 mice than TLR2 knockout (KO) mice, suggesting an inflammatory role for TLR2 in MHV3 infection.34 Hence, the ability of MHVs to ligate and activate TLR2\u2010dependent inflammatory pathways in the liver may represent one determining and differential factor involved in their virulence.",

We explored the hypothesis that MHV3 infection may induce higher expression of TLRs or helicase genes in the liver than MHV\u2010A59. Hence, kinetics of transcription levels of surface TLR2 and TLR4, endosomal TLR3 and TLR7, and helicase RIG\u20101 and MDA\u20105 genes have been assessed by quantitative RT\u2010PCR in the liver of infected mice from 24 to 72 hr p.i. and expressed as mRNA fold changes relative to levels in mock\u2010infected mice. As shown in Fig. 2(a), TLR2 gene expression steadily increased over the course of infection with MHV3 reaching over 120\u2010fold the expression in mock\u2010infected mice at 72 hr p.i. whereas it remained barely increased and drastically lower in MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected mice (P \u2264 0\u00b705 to P \u2264 0\u00b7001).

To verify whether TLR2 is involved in aggravated hepatic damages and viral replication during acute MHV3 infection, groups of WT C57BL/6 and TLR2 KO mice were i.p. infected with MHV3 or MHV\u2010A59 and survival rates, liver injury and viral load in the liver were monitored from 24 to 72 hr p.i. As shown in Fig. 6(a), mortality rate of MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO mice was delayed when compared with infected WT mice as it occurred from only 96 to 120 hr p.i. in contrast to WT mice, for which mortality reached more than 70% of mice at 72 hr p.i. (P \u2264 0\u00b7001). Considering the fulminance of hepatitis, such a statistically significant delay can support a role for TLR2 in the pathogenic processes of hepatitis. As expected, no mortality was observed in WT and TLR2 KO mice infected with MHV\u2010A59 (see Supplementary material, Fig. S2A). Histopathological analysis of livers from MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO revealed inflammatory foci only by 48 hr p.i. and fewer necrotic foci at 72 hr p.i. when compared with liver from MHV3\u2010infected WT mice (Fig. 6b compared with Fig. 1a). In livers from MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected TLR2 KO mice, however, few large inflammatory foci, similar to those observed in MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice, were noted (see Supplementary material, Fig. S2B). Accordingly, serum AST and ALT levels were lower in MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO than in infected WT mice (Fig. 6c,d) (P \u2264 0\u00b705 and P \u2264 0\u00b7001).

Many PRRs are activated after exposure to hepatotrophic viruses, such as endosomal TLR3 or TLR7 and intracytoplasmic helicases RIG\u20101 or MDA\u20105, to activate IFN type 1 and inflammatory factors. In the livers from MHV3\u2010 but not MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice, we have observed greater expression of TLR2 over other PRRs such as TLR3, RIG\u20101, MDA\u20105 or TLR4 and TR7, suggesting that MHV3 preferentially activates TLR2 transcription. Higher expression of TLR2 has been recently associated with disease progression of hepatitis C.44 Levels of hepatic inflammation in HCV\u2010 and HCV/HIV\u2010infected patients, also correlated with higher transcription of TLR2 and TLR4 genes in the liver17 suggesting a pro\u2010inflammatory role for TLR2 in hepatitis. Accordingly, blocking of TLR2 was recently shown to attenuate Concanavalin A\u2010induced experimental hepatitis in mice.45 We have observed fewer hepatic lesions, less viral replication and lower inflammatory responses in MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO mice, indicating that TLR2 may act as an aggravating factor in fulminant hepatitis. However, TLR2 KO mice were not protected from MHV3\u2010induced lethal hepatitis, but survival was significantly improved due to delayed occurrence of hepatic necrosis (observations not shown), supporting that other TLR2\u2010independent mechanisms are also involved in the outcome of MHV3 infection.

It was previously reported that TNF\u2010\u03b1 activity significantly increases as soon as 24 hr p.i. during MHV3 infection, even before the virus is detectable in the liver,47 supporting an early activation through an unidentified signalling pathway. Following i.p. infection, MHV3 primarily replicates in peritoneal macrophages and then within liver Kupffer cells and LSECs.48, 49 A role for macrophages in MHV3\u2010induced TLR2\u2010dependent inflammatory responses is supported by in vitro infections. Our results indicate that both CEACAM1a and TLR2 are involved in viral replication and early IL\u20106 expression (as soon as 5 hr p.i.) in macrophages. Jacques et al.34 have previously demonstrated that TLR2 and heparan sulphate were involved in the induction of inflammatory cytokines in MHV3\u2010infected macrophages. Our results suggest that higher and earlier TLR2\u2010dependent IL\u20106 induction by MHV3 may be related to higher and earlier activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by the virus. In addition, since a very early role for the p38 MAPK pathway (within 30 min) was reported in viral replication of MHV3 in J774.1 macrophages,50 higher and earlier replication of MHV3 than MHV\u2010A59 may also result from differential activation of this pathway by the viruses. No role for TLR2, however, was reported in viral replication and induction of IL\u20106 by MHV\u2010A59.43, 51 Such a difference may explain the lower viral load and inflammatory responses in the liver of MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected mice. In addition, preliminary data have shown that UV\u2010inactivated MHV3 viral particles bound more rapidly to macrophage surface (<10 min) than UV\u2010inactivated MHV\u2010A59, suggesting that S protein from MHV3 may express higher affinity for TLR2 than MHV\u2010A59.",

Vascular and tolerant properties of LSECs, however, were disturbed when in vitro infected with MHV3 (Bleau et al. manuscript in revision). Hence, we can hypothesize that TLR2 fixation of viral infectious particles or free viral S proteins on MHV3 permissive cells, such as Kupffer cells and LSECs, may favour both viral replication and exacerbated inflammatory responses that may contribute to higher liver injury in MHV3\u2010infected mice. Indeed, high levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1 in the liver are generally associated with extensive necrosis,54 and absence of TNF\u2010\u03b1, but not IL\u20106, was recently shown to significantly reduce hepatic lesions (AST/ALT) and increase the survival of MHV3\u2010infected mice.55\n",

Type I IFN production by infected cells is the most important antiviral mechanism acting in the first days of infection. Higher IFN\u2010\u03b2 production, however, was found in the liver of MHV3\u2010infected WT mice than TLR2 KO mice or MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice. The positive correlation between IFN\u2010\u03b2 production and viral replication levels may reflect the spreading of viral replication in the liver rather than the efficiency of antiviral effects. Indeed, it was already reported that higher levels of type I IFN were produced simultaneously with higher MHV3 titres by peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice,56 supporting a negligible role of type I IFN in the control of MHV3 replication. Such explanation is also supported by a positive correlation between low levels of IFN\u2010\u03b2 and low viral replication in MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO mice or MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice, indicating that lower viral replication does not result from higher production of antiviral IFN\u2010\u03b2. In addition, no significant IFN\u2010\u03b1 expression was induced in the liver of all infected groups of mice (results not shown), indicating no major role for type I IFN in the control of MHV replication and hepatitis. In addition, type I IFN response in mouse coronavirus infections depends mainly on TLR3 and helicases RIG\u20101 or MDA\u20105 engagement by viral RNAs.57, 58, 59 Transcription levels of TLR3, RIG\u20101 and MDA\u20105 were comparable in livers from both MHV3\u2010infected WT and TLR2 KO mice and less transcribed in MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice, suggesting that higher induction of IFN\u2010\u03b2 by MHV3 infection did not depend on these PRRs. We can therefore postulate that higher levels of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in the livers of MHV3\u2010infected WT mice may result from extensive hepatic infection and/or TLR2 engagement by MHV3. Indeed, Dietrich et al.42 have demonstrated that translocation of TLR2 in endolysosomal compartments following ligand engagement can trigger IFN\u2010\u03b2 production via the MyD88/interferon regulatory factor (IRF)\u20101/IRF\u20107\u2010dependent pathway in macrophages. Preliminary data revealed increased expression of IRF\u20107 in livers from MHV3\u2010infected WT mice, suggesting activation of this signalling pathway in some hepatic cells. Future work should address this hypothesis. Nevertheless, such an interesting potential new role for TLR2 in IFN\u2010\u03b2 regulation may not be of major importance in MHV3 infection as no protection against hepatitis seems to be provided by high IFN\u2010\u03b2 levels.",

Earlier and higher production of CXCL1, CCL2 and CXCL10, as seen in the liver of MHV3\u2010infected WT mice, may involve rapid recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and NK or T\u2010cell subsets, respectively (reviewed in ref. 40). As expected, CXCL1 production and concomitant neutrophil recruitment occurred sooner in the liver of MHV3\u2010infected WT mice, suggesting that increase in neutrophils may result from early CXCL1 release, as demonstrated by Moles et al.39 The subsequent loss of neutrophils at 48 hr p.i., however, did not depend on a decrease of CXCL1 production because levels increased up to 72 hr p.i. We can hypothesize that recruited neutrophils may serve as a new cell target for viral infection leading to cell apoptosis, such as previously demonstrated for NK cells.60 Work is in progress to clarify the loss of these cells during MHV3 infection. Our data regarding neutrophils slightly differ from those of Xu et al.61 who reported percentage increases of neutrophils up to 48 hr p.i in the liver of MHV3\u2010infected mice. Such apparent discrepancy results from the dramatic decrease in total intrahepatic MNCs, including NK, B and CD4 cells, leading to an apparent increase in neutrophil percentages in spite of a reduction in their absolute number, such as is demonstrated in the present work. These authors also linked neutrophil infiltration to a TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010dependent Fgl\u20102 production. Our results do not support this hypothesis as chemokine production and neutrophil infiltration in the liver occurred earlier than Fgl\u20102 induction in MHV3\u2010infected WT mice. Total counts of MNCs in the livers of both MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO mice and MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice were not highly altered over infection time and neutrophil numbers steadily increased up to 48 hr p.i. supporting a recruitment of these cells despite lower levels of CXCL1. The delayed and preserved neutrophil pool may therefore favour viral clearance and contribute to controlling acute hepatitis, as suggested by lower viral titres, inflammation and damages in these mice. Recent work regarding the respiratory rat coronavirus infection showed that neutrophils were required for an effective antiviral response but could also contribute to lung pathology.62 On the other hand, we cannot exclude that higher levels of chemokines in the liver of MHV3\u2010infected WT mice may also contribute to hepatotoxicity without respect to neutrophil infiltration.63\n",

However, resident and recruited macrophages are permissive to MHV3 infection48, 49 and we have shown that viral replication in macrophages is increased by TLR2, suggesting that low number of macrophages in the livers of MHV3\u2010infected WT mice result from higher viral replication and subsequent cell lysis. Accordingly, the low presence of inflammatory cells in necrosis foci observed in livers from MHV3\u2010infected WT mice may result from virus\u2010induced cell lysis of recruited MNCs. Lower levels of CXCL\u20101 and CCL2 in the livers of MHV3\u2010infected TLR2 KO and MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice involved lower but sustained recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting that these cells might be protective rather than deleterious in acute hepatitis process.

            "text": "Some other inflammatory factors induced by MHV3 infection were less dependent, or not dependent, on TLR2. Indeed, we have observed that IL\u201033 release was less influenced by TLR2 and rather reflected the severity of liver damage, as was previously reported.69, 70 We have recently shown that IL\u201033 expression was up\u2010regulated in the liver of MHV3\u2010infected C57BL/6 mice, mainly in LSECs, vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes in the first 24\u201332 hr p.i.36 This study also demonstrated that TLR3 was involved in the up\u2010regulation of IL\u201033 in poly(I:C)\u2010treated mice. However, IL\u201033 expression was more strongly induced in the livers of MHV3\u2010infected WT mice than in poly(I:C)\u2010treated mice, suggesting that other PRRs might be involved in IL\u201033 release during MHV3 infection. Our observations suggest that TLR2 might be another candidate involved in early IL\u201033 induction. The mechanism(s) by which MHV3 favour(s) IL\u201033 secretion is pending and need(s) further investigation. The induction of the vascular factor Fgl\u20102, a pro\u2010thrombinase promoting microvascular thrombosis and hepatocyte necrosis during MHV3 infection,37, 38 was comparable in WT and TLR2 KO mice and remained low or delayed in MHV\u2010A59\u2010infected WT mice, indicating that this factor is not regulated by TLR2 and not involved in TLR2\u2010exacerbated hepatic damage, in spite of its worsening role in hepatitis outcome.",

            "text": "The present work with animal models of viral hepatitis induced by two closely related serotypes of MHVs, highlights the complex interactions between surface TLR2 and intracellular PRRs in the recognition of viral infections and the induction of protective or worsening inflammatory responses during acute infections. The use of the MHV3 model provided new insights into the aggravating role of surface TLR2 in acute viral diseases. Activation of surface TLR signalling pathways has been recently associated with pathogenic processes in several viral infections. Indeed, TLR2 and/or TLR4 are involved in the induction of inflammatory response in severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, several herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus 1, varicella virus, cytomegalovirus), influenza, HIV, HBV and HCV infections.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 In most cases, TLR2\u2010promoted inflammatory TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106 or chemokine IL\u20108 responses are mediated by macrophages.6, 7, 12, 13, 17 The viral mechanisms involved in the activation of TLR2 inflammatory pathways are not clearly elucidated. The ability of MHV3 viral proteins to bind and activate TLR2 signalling is not unique to coronaviruses. Indeed, HBV and HCV core proteins were reported to induce TLR2\u2010dependent activation of nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB and p38 MAPK and subsequent production of TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106 and IL\u201012 in macrophages.3, 71 Hence, one could presume that activation of TLR2 by HCV/HBV core proteins could aggravate hepatic inflammation and damage. In agreement with this hypothesis, an up\u2010regulation of TLR2 in the liver and on monocytes, correlating with higher TNF\u2010\u03b1 levels and necroinflammatory activity in the liver, was reported in patients with hepatitis C.16, 17 Our data demonstrate for the first time that up\u2010regulating the inflammatory activity of TLR2 in the acute phase of viral hepatitis favours fulminant hepatitis. In humans, fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is an uncommon clinical condition characterized by extensive hepatic necrosis, severe impairment of liver function and a high mortality rate.19 The most recognized causal agents of FHF are hepatitis viruses (especially HBV) but several non\u2010hepatic herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and varicella virus) and drugs were also associated with FHF.19 The pathophysiology of FHF is unclear but increasing evidence suggests that regardless of the aetiological cause of FHF, the host's inflammatory response contributes to liver microcirculatory disorders and injury. Accordingly, macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokines were shown to play a key role in FHF.72, 73 Moreover, the core protein from HBV was suggested as a potential initiating factor in patients with fulminant hepatitis B but mechanisms are still elusive.74, 75 Hence, we can propose that strong TLR2\u2010dependent activation of macrophages in the liver by viral proteins from hepatitis or non\u2010hepatitis viruses during acute infection may predispose to FHF induction.",
