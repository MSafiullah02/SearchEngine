To look for potential risk factors or predictors of the disease, we identified an additional 82 patients who met the case definition for suspected MERS-CoV but who ultimately tested negative for the disease. The 2 groups were similar in age and sex. The median age was 62 years for cases; the previously reported median age for cases was 50 years [14]. Male predominance of patients (65% in the cases vs 36% in the control group) did not reach statistical significance. Earlier studies showed male predominance, as in the current study. Most recent analysis showed a larger proportion of younger female cases with a reduction of the male-to-female ratio [15, 16].

Subsequently, patients with mild or no symptoms were reported [16]. The initial presentation of the disease is not different than other causes of CAP [2, 7, 11, 12]. Some patients may have sore throat, chills, arthralgia, or myalgia [7, 11, 12, 17, 18]. In the current study, these symptoms were present in MERS-CoV\u2013positive and MERS-CoV\u2013negative patients at equal rates. Thus, these symptoms have poor discriminating power for MERS-CoV infection. At the time of admission, tachypnea and respiratory distress were less frequently seen among cases than controls (27% vs 60% and 15% vs 51%, respectively; Table 1). The exact reason for this difference is not known. Should this finding be confirmed in subsequent studies, it would be an important distinguishing characteristic.",

In another analysis, 53 of the 114 (46.5%) hospitalized patients died [14]. This difference is related to the identification of mild cases and asymptomatic cases. The mortality rate in MERS-CoV infections is also related to the number of underlying risk factors [12], 54% in those with 2 underlying conditions compared with 80% in those with 3\u20134 underlying conditions [12].

Second, the retrospective nature of the study may also limit the power of the study to identify clinical predictors. Third, the inclusion of patients from the Al-Hasa outbreak may have contributed to the absence of significance of predictors of MERS-CoV and may explain why there were high proportions of ESRD and diabetic patients among our cases. One of the strengths of our study is ascertainment of cases and controls through the master list that included all cases admitted to rule out MERS-CoV infection during the study period. In conclusion, the results suggest that few clinical predictors could enhance the ability to predict which patients with CAP would have MERS-CoV. However, further prospective analysis and matched case-control studies may shed light on the possible predictors of infection.",
