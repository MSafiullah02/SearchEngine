Methods Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). Results A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p < 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001).",

This infection is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is so far responsible for more than 15,000 deaths worldwide [2] . Human-to-human transmission is characterized by a troubling exponential rate, which has led to steep curves of onset in many areas [3] . According to the clinical studies from Asia, the most prevalent symptoms consist of fever, cough, dyspnea, sputum production, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, and sore throat [4, 5] . The spread of the COVID-19 infection in Europe has highlighted a new atypical presentation of the disease: patients with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. The occurrence of smell dysfunction in viral infections is not new in otolaryngology. Many viruses may lead to olfactory dysfunction (OD) through an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa and the development of rhinorrhea; the most familiar agents being rhinovirus, parainfluenza Epstein-Barr virus, and some coronavirus [6, 7] . However, olfactory dysfunction linked to COVID-19 infection seems particular as it is not associated with rhinorrhea.",

Each item is rated on a scale of 0-3, with higher scores reflecting better olfactory-specific QOL. The total score ranges from 0 (severe impact on QoL) to 21 (no impact on QoL) [9] . The item and total scores of sQOD-NS significantly differ between patients with anosmia at the time of the assessment, and those with hyposmia or without olfactory dysfunction (*p = 0.001) having anosmia. Interestingly, many profiles of patients have been identified. First, our data showed that 79.7% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea reported hyposmia or anosmia, supporting the role of otolaryngologists as the first-line physicians for some COVID-19 patients. Second, the olfactory dysfunction may appear before, during, or after the general symptoms, with the occurrence of fever being associated with the olfactory dysfunction. There have been few studies on the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in Asia, since only one study reported hyposmia as a symptom of the COVID-19 infection [12] . In the study of Mao et al., patients with peripheral nervous system symptoms attributed to COVID-19 infection, the most common the most common complaints were hypogeusia (5.6%) and hyposmia (5.1%) [12] . According to the data of the present study, the prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is substantially higher in European COVID-19 patients.",

One of the most important questions from the otolaryngologists concerned the recovery of olfactory and gustatory functions. Although our results are still preliminary, it seems that, at least, 25.5% of patients recovered both olfactory and gustatory functions throughout the 2 weeks after the resolution of general symptoms. Considering the time to get a significant reduction of the viral load [10] , we have estimated that 56% of patients have persistent olfactory dysfunction over the days following the resolution of the COVID-19 general clinical manifestations. In the same vein, some patients seemed to recover olfaction, but not taste, and vice versa. Naturally, there are short-term observations and it is reasonable to think that a large number of these patients will recover the olfactory or gustatory functions over the weeks following the disease resolution. To summarize, the present study clearly supports the recent declarations of many physicians from South Korea, Iran, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, UK, and US that olfactory and gustatory functions may be impaired in COVID-19 patients.",

From a biomolecular standpoint, viruses could infect peripheral neurons, using the cell machinery of active transport to access the central nervous system [13] . Thus, for the SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), it has been demonstrated on transgenic mice that SARS-CoV may enter the brain through the olfactory bulb, leading to rapid transneuronal spread [14] . Interestingly, authors demonstrated that the virus antigen was first detected 60-66 h post-infection and was most abundant in the olfactory bulb. Regions of the cortex (piriform and infralimbic cortices), basal ganglia (ventral pallidum and lateral preoptic regions), and midbrain (dorsal raphe) were also strongly infected after the virus had spread [14] ; these regions are connected with the olfactory bulb. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV in the brain was also associated with significant neuronal death. In humans, autopsy samples from eight patients with SARS revealed the presence of SARS-CoV in brain samples by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and real-time RT-PCR [15] . It is currently suspected that the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV2 plays a key role in the respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients [16] . Medical imaging and neuropathology will certainly play an important rule to detect abnormalities in olfactory bulb, cranial nerves, and brain of COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "The otolaryngological symptoms in our European cohort were particularly prevalent compared with the Asian cohorts. In their clinical series of 99 patients, Chen et al. reported four patients with rhinorrhea (4%) [17] . Then, Guan et al. reported a prevalence of nasal obstruction in 5% of patients in a cohort of 1099 patients [18] . The lack of otolaryngological complaints in Asian papers, e.g., nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, raises many questions. Either they did not assess the ENT complaints, or the Chinese patients had a few ENT complaints. The second hypothesis may be likely regarding previous studies. Benvenuto et al. have recently compared the complete genomes of 15 virus sequences from patients treated in different regions of China with other coronaviruses [19] . Interestingly, they observed mutations of surface proteins (spike-S-protein and nucleocapsid-Nprotein), conferring stability to the viral particle. Such mutations could be clinically relevant, because the viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell, whereas the N-protein plays a pivotal role in the virus transcription and assembly efficiency. Previously, Chan et al. determined five virus sequences from patients traveling in Wuhan at the end of December 2019. This study reported identities, but less than 68%, with the SARS-related coronaviruses in specific domains. Particularly, the external subdomain region of receptor-binding domain of the S-protein only presents 39% identity, and Chan et al. propose that it might affect the choice of human receptor and, therefore, the biological behaviour of this virus [20] . The affinity of some viruses for some tissues and individuals constitutes another area to investigate and explain the potential clinical differences between patients from different world regions. Recent studies suggested that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, could be specific to certain populations. Li et al. demonstrated that some ACE2 variants could reduce the association between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S-protein [21] . In other words, the expression level of ACE2 in different tissues might be critical for the susceptibility, symptoms, and outcomes of COVID-19 infection [21] . Moreover, the comparison of the 15 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) variants of the ACE2 gene suggested that there will be a lot of ACE2 polymorphisms and ACE2 expression levels between Asian and European populations [22] . According to these studies, it is conceivable that the diversity of ACE2 expression pattern in Asian and European populations could be an important track that needs further investigation.",

First, our patients did not benefit from specific examinations for olfactory and gustatory functions, including psychophysical tests or electrophysiological methods [24, 25] . The use of objective approaches makes sense for investigating both gustatory and olfactory functions in COVID-19 patients, and to avoid the confusion related to the retro-olfaction. These approaches would provide many responses for patients who may recover olfaction, but not taste, and vice versa. Second, our patient sample consisted of young and mildto-moderate COVID-19 patients with little comorbidities. They may be not representative of the infected population. However, it seems ethically difficult to investigate olfaction and gustatory function in patients in life-threatening condition, such as patients in intensive-care units. Note that in this study, the majority of included patients were identified from hospital laboratory results. However, many infected physicians completed the study, and, therefore, it remains possible that many infected physicians participated to the study, because they suffered from olfactory dysfunction, although the authors have been particularly vigilant to this potential bias. Third, the lack of consistent follow-up of our patients limits us from inquiring into the recovery time of olfactory and gustatory functions, and, therefore, the rate of permanent anosmia or ageusia. Fourth, it seems difficult to identify the potential negative impact of nasal and oral corticosteroids on the clinical course of the disease; these treatments are usually used for anosmia or in common nasal complaints. In the absence of such data, the precautionary principle may prevail and, according to the guidelines of the French Society of Otolaryngology, patients must avoid corticosteroids for the treatment of the COVID-19 infection. All of these weaknesses should be considered in future studies to investigate and characterize the olfactory and gustatory functions in COVID-19 patients.",
