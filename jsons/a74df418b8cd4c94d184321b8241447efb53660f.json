            "text": "This manuscript describes a cryo-electron tomographic analysis of the interactions of influenza virus particles with artificial liposomes made of di-oleoyl-phosphatidyl choline (DOPC), a type of lipid that is frequently found in natural membranes. The authors demonstrate a striking deformation of the liposomes induced by the contact with the virus particles, after lowering the pH to 5.5. This effect is consistent with the pH sensitivity of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), which undergoes a major conformational change when exposed to low pH. The conformational transition causes the transient exposure of the \"fusion peptides\", which insert in the target membrane, before acquire the well known \"hairpin conformation\" that has both fusion loops and viral transmembrane segments juxtaposed at the same side of the molecule. Importantly, the images show that there is an apparent disruption of the liposome membrane at the point of contact, which is likely to be surrounded by a number of HA molecules, perhaps in the pre-hairpin intermediate conformation, with the fusion loops inserted in the liposome. These are striking images, which have not been observed previously, and are therefore extremely valuable to get a better picture of the membrane fusion process. This work also highlights the role of the matrix protein layer that underlies the viral membrane, in preserving the particle shape and concentrating the deformation on the target membrane. This matrix protein layer appears to make an ultimate barrier to complete fusion, which apparently requires dissociation of the matrix layer to proceed, which the authors propose is an important feature and requires lowering the pH to about 5.",

            "text": "1. The liposomes. As the author states, DOPC is a curvature-neutral lipid, and liposomes composed exclusively of DOPC usually are quite large, having a tendency to make planar lipid bilayers. However, the liposomes imaged in contact with the virus particles are all very small, often smaller than the virions. Such small liposomes have a strong curvature, certainly imposing a lot of stress on the liposomes to begin with. There is no explanation in the Materials and Methods about the way in which the liposomes were prepared. 2. The effect on the liposome is likely to be the result of insertion of the fusion loops from a number of HA protomers into the target membrane. Because the insertion is only in the outer leaflet of the bilayer, this can result in a more pronounced curvature at the site of contact, which would make a sort of dimple, as observed. My question is, concerning the breks (or holes): has the author taken into account the possibility that there is still continuity in the inner leaflet of the liposome in those regions? Can the density become diffuse enough when many fusion loops accumulate in that region of the liposome, such that the contrast is affected, resulting in the impression of a break? This is just a point for the discussion, the images are quite clear, but it would be important to state that there is no other interpretation possible. 3. DOPC liposomes are known for not yielding complete fusion. Has the author monitor fusion by some other means, to see if this system yields full fusion if brought to pH 5, for instance? I understand that it is a very nice way to trap an intermediate state of the process to be able to visualize it, but the questions that comes next is: is this an intermediate in the pathway to full fusion, or is it a dead end. 4. The colored representation given in Figure 3C is confusing. The liposome is expected to have a continuous density. I this Figure, it is difficult to tell what are the proteins, what are membranes. 5. In Fig 5, the author claims that there are HA molecules invading the liposome up to the level of the \"neck\". Since there are virus particles also underneath, cand those spots belong to this other particles? It is not clear to me from the picture.",

            "text": "The presented tomograms are impressive and reveal a number of states in the fusion process. Such detail in resolution and intermediates has not been achieved before. However, I cannot agree with some of the interpretations of the data and conclusion drawn. In particular, one should be very cautious in electron tomography when interpreting density continuity. The absence of continuity might be caused by the imaging conditions. The effect of the contrast transfer function (CTF) might cause bright fringes around objects and can such impair neighboring densities. Given the defocus values used (3-5 micrometers at 120KeV accelerating voltage) this will have an effect. The effect is visible e.g. as white fringe inside and around the liposome membranes and around the HA-spikes in the lower part of the slices in Fig. 2A . Subsequently, it cannot be excluded that the appearance of the liposome membrane as an open funnel that is not connected to the viral membrane in Fig. 2A , slice 1 and 2B might as well be caused by the fringe of the HA-spikes and the viral membrane respectively. This has major consequences in terms of the interpretation of the data in the suggested model. The steps up to and including the dimpling are well justified and the unilateral dimpling of the liposome membrane caused by the higher rigidity of the viral membrane being reinforced by the underlying matrix layer are well supported by the data and discussion. The following 'scission' step is an interpretation and the CTF effects might have caused this appearance as outlined above. Even though a similar model is discussed in the literature before, I do not see sufficient evidence for this step presented here. Optimizing the imaging conditions (working closer to focus, using a smaller pixel size to resolve the two bilayers of the liposome membrane unequivocally) might improve the situation and will allow analyzing this aspect of the process in the future. Furthermore, CTF correction as recently introduced (e.g. Briggs et al., 2009, PNAS; Zanetti, et al., 2009, JSB) would allow getting a clearer picture of the events and membrane continuities. The events described as scission and apposition might in fact all present hemifusion states. The final steps involving pore expansion enabled by disassembly of the matrix layer triggered by the further shift in pH to pH 5 seems likely. If the author encountered direct evidence for post fusion states at pH 5 when setting up the experimental system and optimizing the pH conditions for finding intermediates, this might support that latter step and should be mentioned.",

Similarly the black arrow in Figure 5 should show us that the HA particles have migrated up the neck, and suggest to us that HA is still bound to the matrix layer.

The authors demonstrate a striking deformation of the liposomes induced by the contact with the virus particles, after lowering the pH to 5.5. This effect is consistent with the pH sensitivity of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), which undergoes a major conformational change when exposed to low pH. The conformational transition causes the transient exposure of the \"fusion peptides\", which insert in the target membrane, before acquire the well known \"hairpin conformation\" that has both fusion loops and viral transmembrane segments juxtaposed at the same side of the molecule. Importantly, the images show that there is an apparent disruption of the liposome membrane at the point of contact, which is likely to be surrounded by a number of HA molecules, perhaps in the pre-hairpin intermediate conformation, with the fusion loops inserted in the liposome. These are striking images, which have not been observed previously, and are therefore extremely valuable to get a better picture of the membrane fusion process. This work also highlights the role of the matrix protein layer that underlies the viral membrane, in preserving the particle shape and concentrating the deformation on the target membrane. This matrix protein layer appears to make an ultimate barrier to complete fusion, which apparently requires dissociation of the matrix layer to proceed, which the authors propose is an important feature and requires lowering the pH to about 5.",

One concern in using the larger liposomes is that they would be squashed in the thin ice layer and subject to significant stresses due to that. The text describing liposome preparation that has been added to the Materials and Methods section reads as follows: \"3-5 mg/ml 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC, Avanti Polar Lipids) liposomes containing 25 mM sulforhodamine-B (SRB) fluorophore (Invitrogen Corp.) were produced by drying a 25 mg/ml DOPC chloroform solution under nitrogen gas. The dried lipid was resuspended in 225 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5 buffer containing 25 mM SRB dye; the lower salt concentration was used in order to equalize the osmotic balance on the two sides of the membrane with 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5 storage buffer. The resuspended lipid was subjected to 5 sequential freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, followed by 21 extrusions through polycarbonate filters with 100 nm pore size (Avanti Polar Lipids). 100 nm liposomes were selected for the study because larger sizes (e.g. 200 or 400 nm diameter) would likely be as thick as or thicker than typical ice thicknesses in the cryo-EM samples. One concern in using the larger liposomes is that they would be squashed in the thin ice layer and subject to stresses due to the compression. The dyeencapsulating liposomes eluted as a single band from PD-10 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare) and were stored in the same pH 7.5 HEPES buffer used for virus storage. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Brookhaven 90+ Nanoparticle Size Analyzer was used to characterize the polydispersity and average dimension of the liposomes at room temperature. Liposome diameters from individual preparations ranged from 125-145 nm by DLS, and polydispersity was typically very low, 0.002-0.020. DLS also confirmed that no significant change in liposome dimensions resulted from incubating the liposomes at pH 5.0-5.5 for up to an hour (longest duration tested). Likewise, when liposomes were acidified to pH 5.0 and 5.5, leakage of sulforhodamine-B was not detected by fluorescence monitoring. It was concluded that the liposomes are stable under the acidic pH conditions used in the fluorescence and ECT studies. Liposomes were used within 24 h of their production.\"",

My question is, concerning the breks (or holes): has the author taken into account the possibility that there is still continuity in the inner leaflet of the liposome in those regions? Can the density become diffuse enough when many fusion loops accumulate in that region of the liposome, such that the contrast is affected, resulting in the impression of a break?

The absence of continuity might be caused by the imaging conditions. The effect of the contrast transfer function (CTF) might cause bright fringes around objects and can such impair neighboring densities. Given the defocus values used (3-5 micrometers at 120KeV accelerating voltage) this will have an effect. The effect is visible e.g. as white fringe inside and around the liposome membranes and around the HA-spikes in the lower part of the slices in Fig. 2A . Subsequently, it cannot be excluded that the appearance of the liposome membrane as an open funnel that is not connected to the viral membrane in Fig. 2A , slice 1 and 2B might as well be caused by the fringe of the HA-spikes and the viral membrane respectively.

The complex shown in Fig. 7A may correspond to a state slightly further along the fusion pathway than the putative funnel complexes, in which a funnel-like structure appears to be nestled into the viral envelope. While strong Fresnel fringes are observed around the liposomal density, at the base of the remodeled liposome\u00eds neck, fringes do not obscure the intersection of the neck and virus envelope and density appears continuous without prominent gaps. If CTF artifacts due to the strong liposomal bilayer were always responsible for observed gaps between liposome and virus density, one would expect a similar gap to show up in this case. The defocus in Fig 7A was 5 \u00b5m, as it was in the case shown in Fig 5B. Prefusion target membrane permeability has been documented previously in the literature. Those results as well as their own experimental study led Bonnafous and Stegmann to propose their prefusion target membrane disruption model. Thus the precedent for the putative open-mouthed funnel extends well beyond a single hypothetical model on paper. The fluorescence data that is now included in the manuscript provides insight into the question of whether prefusion target membrane scission takes place under conditions similar to those used in the ECT preparations, and whether an open-mouthed funnel is a reasonable, data-supported interpretation of observed density (Fig. 2 , revised version).

The observation of a break in density at its nexus with a virus particle, is consistent with prefusion leakage. In most cases where liposomal funnels are observed, the virus envelope nearby is seen to be unperturbed, implying that the viral membrane leaflets are not participating in the locus. In fact scission appears to take place at stages before apposition: Figure 5A , slice 1 shows a case where liposome membrane has been disrupted at the site of coordination with a cluster of HA spikes. While this breach is somewhat larger (~10 nm wide) than the funnel-shaped structures that are closely apposed to the membrane, they demonstrate that prefusion membrane scission is observed.",
