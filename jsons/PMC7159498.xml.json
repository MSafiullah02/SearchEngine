The percentage of cats with FIP and AGP\u2010positive neutrophils was not significantly higher than in the control group, but among FCoV\u2010positive cats the proportion of cats expressing AGP on neutrophils was higher among sick compared with healthy cats. However, some clinically healthy cats did have AGP\u2010positive leucocytes in their blood, which may have been related to stress or fear.

This was presumed to be secondary to neurogenic dysphagia, which is a common presenting sign of Chiari malformations in humans, but has been rarely described in veterinary literature. Decompressive surgery of the foramen magnum in this case was deemed essential, given the unique life\u2010threatening clinical signs, and the dog responded rapidly.

The developing brain shows an age\u2010dependent response to TBI and the immature nervous system often responds differently to that of an adult. The outcome in young animals after TBI is complex, in part because recovery is superimposed upon developmental events.

A reduction in dietary vitamin D3 at one facility led to a significant decline in serum 25(OH)\u2010D concentrations to levels comparable with wild echidnas.
