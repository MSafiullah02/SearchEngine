Influenza is a contagious virus affecting both one's health and economic productivity. This study evaluates uses a sur-19 vey of 2168 individuals across the U.S. Ordered logit regressions are used to model risk perception and generalized 20 ordered logit regressions are used to model risk mitigation travel-related decisions. Models are estimated for three in-21 fluenza outbreak scenarios, specifically an individual's travel-related: 1) risk perceptions, 2) risk mitigation decisions 22 when infected and the individual wants to prevent spreading it, and may want treatment, and 3) risk mitigation deci-23 sions when not infected and the individual wants to reduce exposure. Risk perception results show that a recent per-24 sonal experience with influenza-like symptoms and being female significantly increased risk perception at mandatory 25 and medical trip locations. Risk mitigation model results show that males are less likely to alter their travel patterns in 26 response to the possible spreading of the virus or increasing exposure. Knowing the difference between influenza and 27 the stomach flu is more influential in reducing travel than a recent influenza experience in one's household. Individuals 28 proactive with their health (i.e., receive the vaccine, have health insurance) are also proactive in seeking medical at-29 tention and reducing influenza spread. Lastly, aligned with the Protection Motivation Theory, individuals reduce travel 30 to locations in which they perceived medium or high risk. However, increased risk perceived at one's work location did 31 not significantly reduce travel. The findings provide insight into the risk perception and mitigation behavior of the 32 American public during the COVID-19 pandemic and after restrictions are lifted. (Schoenbaum, 1987 ",

Three scenarios are 125 tested with respect to an influenza outbreak, specifically an individual's 126 travel-related: 1) risk perceptions, 2) risk mitigation decisions when in-127 fected, the individual wants to prevent spreading it, and may want treat-128 ment, and 3) risk mitigation decisions when not infected and the 129 individual wants to reduce exposure. This study adds to the existing litera-130 ture through these scenarios and the specific locations considered 131 (i.e., rather than social-distancing in general). Scenario 1 includes the loca-132 tions for work, school, restaurants, libraries, doctor's offices, and hospitals. 133 Understanding the risk perceptions of contracting influenza at these loca-134 tions may provide insights for how the public will view the risk of 135 contracting other viruses (e.g., COVID-19) when travel restrictions are 136 lifted but before vaccines are available. Scenario 2's risk mitigation models 137 pertain to visiting doctors' offices, avoiding public places, avoiding public 138 transit, and staying home. The factors identified in these models may be 139 helpful for researchers analyzing disease spread. Scenario 3's risk mitiga-140 tion models pertain to the last three locations in Scenario 2 and the factors 141 associated with these models may indicate which individuals are more 142 likely to voluntarily social-distance even when not requested by governing 143 entities.",

The ordered logit methodology was used as all models passed the 244 parallel regression assumption.Table 2presents the six models, where the 245 work model was estimated only on responses from employed participants 246 and the school model on responses from households that had children 247 12 years old and younger. The McFadden pseudo-R 2 was used to indicate 248 the model goodness-of-fit, which typically has low values and should not 249 be interpreted as a linear regression R-squared value. Previous researchers 250 (Noru\u0161is, 2012; Grilli and Rampichini, 2014) using the ordered logistic re-251 gression have reported values from 0.012 to 0.075. 252 As indicated inTable 2, males significantly perceived lower risk at 253 work, school and the doctor's office. This finding is consistent with litera-254 ture where, in a review of studies related to gender and risk perception,255    Gustafsod found that while men and women are concerned about the 256 same things, women frequently worry more(Gustafsod, 1998). Davidson257 and Freudenburg suggested that the traditional gender role of women 258 being nurturers and care providers within a family could lead to higher 259 health risk perceptions (Davidson and Freudenburg, 1996).260 If the participant or someone in their household had been infected with 261 influenza in the past 6 months, that person had a heightened risk percep-262 tion at all of the locations with work having the greatest increase. This is 263 similar to the findings in Leung et al. (2003), where in the context of severe 264 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), those with relevant symptoms were 265 more likely to take precautionary measures. 266 Employees of jobs that involve close contact with the public viewed 267 their workplaces as having higher risk. This type of employment allows 268 greater opportunities for exposure to viruses through the exhalation of in-269 fected individuals (Fabian et al., 2008) as well as coughing and sneezing. 270 Renters perceived their workplaces to have lower risk on average. Single 271 parent households on average saw the workplace as having a higher risk 272 of contracting influenza compared to non-single parent households. How-273 ever, on average, they viewed the school environment to have lower risk 274 than their counterparts. 275 Household income was indirectly related to perceived risk for discre-276 tionary trips. This indirect relationship is consistent with other literature 277 that found that higher income individuals/households were more capable 278 of making purchases to reduce their risk (Dosman et al., 2001). Those living 279 in a metropolitan area perceived higher risk at the library compared to 280 those not living in a metropolitan area. Those with children 12 years old 281 and younger did not have significantly different risk perceptions for work 282 and discretionary trip locations, but did view medical locations as having 283 higher risk. This may be due to children having immature immune systems 284 compared to adults, where immunity memory is established during the first 285 18 years of a person's life (Dietert et al., 2000). Also, having knowledge of 286 the difference between influenza and the stomach flu increased risk percep-287 tion at hospitals.",

Similar to the 372 findings in Scenario 2, males were less likely to avoid public places and to 373 stay at home to reduce exposure to influenza. However, males were much 374 less likely to take action when already infected compared to women (Sce-375 nario 2) than when not infected (Scenario 3). Across all models in both sce-376 narios, having a child younger than 12 years old in the household was only377 statistically significant in avoiding public places in Scenario 3. Having chil-378 dren in the household reduces one's ability to avoid public places when they 379 are not sick. This could be due to obligations that the caregiver or other chil-380 dren in the household cannot get out of easily as well as the necessary er-381 rands a caretaker needs to make. Neither knowledge nor experience 382 statistically significantly impacted a person's travel-related risk mitigation. 383 Risk perception was significant in all three models. Respondents were more 384 likely to avoid public places and stay at home if there was increased per-385 ceived risk in stores and more likely to avoid transit when there is increased 386 risk perceived of contracting influenza in the transit system. However, re-387 spondents perceiving medium or high risk of contracting influenza at 388 work were less likely to stay at home. This may be reasonable since em-389 ployees may only be able to miss work when they are actually sick 390 themselves. 391 In Scenario 2, household income per capita, self-identifying as Cauca-392 sian, non-Hispanic, and employment are indirectly related to taking action 393 to prevent the spread when infected and the respondent's age was directly 394 related to taking action. These indirect and direct relationships are also 395 seen in Scenario 3's results with trying to reduce exposure to influenza. 396 This suggests that people who take travel-related actions when infected 397 with influenza to prevent the spread are more likely to take travel-related 398 actions to prevent getting infected during an influenza outbreak.399Also, the significant variables in Scenario 3's models show that respon-400 dents with a higher education (i.e., at least a bachelor's degree) were less 401 likely to stay at home to reduce exposure during an influenza outbreak. Sin-402 gle individuals (i.e., divorced, never married, or widowed) were more403 likely to avoid transit compared to their married counterparts, while 404 those living in a metropolitan area were less likely to stay home. In general, 405 findings from both Scenarios 2 and 3 support that wealthier and educated 406 respondents (i.e., high household income per capita, are employed, and 407 have at least a bachelor's degree) were less likely to reduce travel in re-408 sponse to influenza. This is evident from the statistical significance of the 409 Income/HHSize, BS Degree, and Working variables. Specifically, in Sce-410 nario 2 high household income per capita was statistically significantly 411 linked to less likely staying at home and those employed were less likely 412 to avoid public places and stay at home.

Individuals who were proactive about taking care of their health 488 (i.e., received annual vaccines and had health insurance coverage) were 489 also proactive in reducing their exposure and spread of influenza. Lastly, 490 in alignment with the Protection Motivation Theory, in general, individuals 491 tended to reduce travel to locations in which they perceived medium or 492 high risk of contracting influenza, such as stores. However, perception of in-493 creased risk at work locations did not show an increased likelihood to stay 494 home. 495 Future research in this area could combine the findings from this study 496 with agent-based models that track individual's travel participation and re-497 sponses to virus outbreaks. This could lead to more refined estimates of 498 transmission and levels of exposure.

            "text": "). Three types of influenza affect human health: seasonal, Zoonotic or variant, and pandemic influenza (WHO, 2014). Seasonal influenza can affect individuals multiple times in their lifetimes and is predominant during winter months, in regions with a temperate climate. Zoonotic or variant forms of influenza are spread by the interaction between humans and animals and have been recorded several times in the past century (WHO, 2014). Whereas, a virus is pandemic when it has not previously circulated amongst humans and creates signifi-Chappell, 2020). Pandemics can lead to much higher death tolls worldwide if not contained quickly through social distancing measures and vaccines. Influenza spreads from person to person through sneezing, coughing 62 (Stelzer-Braid et al., 2009 Q6 ), or touching contaminated surfaces (Jones, 2011). COVID-19 can live on surfaces for several days (Gray, 2020) and be airborne for up to three hours (Harvard Medical School, 2020). Individuals can be exposed to the virus at a variety of locations based on their daily activities, such as work, school, restaurants, libraries, hospitals, and doctor's offices. Seasonal influenza vaccinations are developed based on predictions of which virus strains will be prevalent in a given year, but the effectiveness varies, meaning those who are vaccinated can become ill after exposure to a strain that is not well matched by the vaccine or if the individuals are unable to develop a protective immune response. Chances of contracting or spreading the infection can be reduced if a person alters their behavior effectively when they perceive high influenza risk during their daily activities. For the purposes of this paper, risk is a combination of consequences and likelihood. The consequences are contracting influenza and the severity of the symptoms, which are a function of individual health and mitigation measures. The likelihood can be considered a function of exposure and susceptibility. The influenza virus is a threat to an individual's health if he/she is not immune. Previous studies have linked the preventative health measures an individual takes with the risk perceived (Marathe et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2010; Chai et al., 2010).
