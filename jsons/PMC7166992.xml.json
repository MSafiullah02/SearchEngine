A dominant tendency is just to ignore such improper outbreaks, and to concentrate on the \u2018normal\u2019 game plans. Yet, some bold thinkers \u2013 philosophers, doctors, strategists, lawyers, mathematicians and economist \u2013 have always been captivated by such strange quirks of \u2018nature\u2019 and history. Ever since the ancient Greeks, \u2018crisis\u2019 has received special attention: how to envision and deal with such difficult trials sent by the gods or nature? The quest has always been seen as foolish: how to study the exception to the rule, the \u2018irrational'? And dubious too: those studying such disturbances were incapable of providing a clear definition of their elusive \u2018object\u2019. And probably blasphemous into the bargain: you do not question the gods nor the laws of nature and science. In a sense, the very idea of a \u2018theory\u2019 of crisis appeared and still appears as a contradiction in terms, both inconsistent and suspect (B\u00e9jin & Morin, 1976).",

The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the remarkable development of sociological studies devoted to communities confronted with natural disasters (Quarantelli & Dynes, 1977) and studies of international crises were prolific (Hermann, 1972; Allison, 1971). In the late 1970s, and increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s, the field was opened up to take stock of the new kinds of shocks that impact complex technological societies, beyond natural disasters alone. A profusion of severe turbulences were examined \u2013 international shocks, factory explosions, product tampering, prison protests, urban riots, football stadium tragedies, train or plane hijackings, specific financial crises, etc. Case studies multiplied and sustained efforts were made to consolidate theoretical perspectives and models (Rosenthal, Charles, \u2018t Hart, 1989; Lagadec, 1993). In parallel, much was done to clarify number of \u2018best practices\u2019 to deal with these events and their ripple effects (Fink, 1986; Ten Berge, 1990). Many disciplines were mobilized to open up new lines of thought and to lend their support to the development of knowledge. Yet a lingering plea was made to consolidate, beyond mere case studies, some better \u2018theory\u2019 of crisis.",

            "text": "Beyond immediate \u2018facts\u2019 \u2013 from Katrina to Fukushima, from the global financial and economic meltdown to global outbursts of civil unrest \u2013 we need to clarify structural factors that change the whole territory of crises, and call for a decisive upgrade of crisis theory.\nFrom large\u2010scale to off\u2010scale: \nmajor events are not new, but they have got denser, and appear to affect greater numbers, even entire continents and the entire planet, threatening millions, hundred of millions \u2013 because of blackouts, pandemics, economic upheavals and social implosions. Multiplication and concomitance of such mega shocks lead to situations where the means are overwhelmed, where everyone or almost, is under the threat.\nFrom complexity to the unreadable: \neverything can be qualified as complex, but such events as Hurricane Katrina (2005) have shown how today mega shocks can trigger tremors that are impossible to categorize and map. The case of Hurricane Irene (2011) striking the east side of the American continent is a warning sign: it is impossible to know in advance the potential multiple\u2010head strikes and disruption dynamics \u2013 airports, stock exchange, vital networks, military capacities, etc. \u2013 of such mega shocks. The field of the complex event gives way to the totally elusive global situation.\nFrom tightly\u2010coupled to total interdependence: \nmuch has been said, in the 20th century, on critical infrastructures and coupled interdependent systems (Perrow, 1984, 2007). We are now switching to another picture: there is no longer a mere chain of interactions, but \u2018piles\u2019 of activities, \u2018biologically\u2019 entangled and intertwined. Hence, shocks trigger swells that swallow up \u2018totalities\u2019, beyond the idea of incremental transmission. Reverberation dynamics are unfolding, not only on the ground and from one place to another, but from one network to another, one hub to another, one underlying fabric to another \u2013 locally, nationally and globally. This was a characteristic of Fukushima (2011): the plant, the adjacent territory, the province, the nation and the world (with the partial loss of key electronic components, becoming more severe after the additional flooding in Thailand). We have clearly switched from complex problems to something else.\nFrom high speed to instantaneity: \ncase studies in the 20th century had always underlined the speed factor, especially when it dealt with media coverage. We are now switching to something else and with a qualitative leap: in 2003, the SARS virus travelled from Hong Kong to Toronto within a few hours, and the capital city of Ontario was deep in crisis before the World Health Organization sounded the worldwide alert; in 2010, Wall Street witnessed the \u2018disappearance\u2019 of 700 billion US $ in just 7 milliseconds. More radical still: electronic media coverage is now totally in real time, globally. During the top secret operation against Bin Laden, the news of the attack was already on Twitter as the core strategic group was following the assault from the West Wing war room; during the shootings in Liege (Belgium, 14 December 2011), one tweet said that the gunman was in police uniform: and one sees the crowd fleeing from the police, the police not being aware of that item of news.\nFrom local events to in\u2010depth dislocation: \nthis is the most decisive watershed. Until now, we were focused on the specific event striking its target and the direct or indirect \u2018vicinity\u2019 of that target. In addition, such a strike occurred within a closed field, naturally robust and stable. Studies tried to explain how the event could affect a large territory, step by step, and how the environment could finally absorb the shocks coming from the initial \u2018Ground Zero\u2019. Now, due to global interdependences, shockwaves are finding a milieu favourable to instant chain effects without \u2018watertight compartments\u2019. As Arjen Boins underlines: \u2018The modern crisis does not confine itself to a particular policy area (say health or energy); it jumps from one field to the other, unearthing issues and recombining them into unforeseen mega\u2010threats\u2019 (Boin, 2004, p. 166).\n",

            "text": "Moreover, fundamental fabrics (environment, economy, culture, etc.) are often in a state of pre\u2010liquefaction, already very fragile. The slightest quiver can develop into extreme tremors. The event itself does not unfold in an absorbent milieu, but in a resonance chamber. This milieu is prone to triggering rogue waves through the combination\u2010recombination of single shocks. Hence, it becomes quasi impossible to trace an event on a graph, along predefined lines. The paradigm has shifted. We are just now witnessing the conflagration triggered in the Arab world by a film posted on Internet: a low cost weapon of mass dislocation.\nFrom uncertainty to ignorance: \nthere is no such thing as a risk or a crisis without uncertainty, but we are now driven into \u2018voids\u2019 of understanding and action that epitomize a loss of fundamental reference points. Instantaneity, absorption of large parts of realities until then isolated, abundance of reverberations, rogue wave multiplication, loss of fundamental anchors and bedrocks \u2026 all this casts us adrift far beyond our familiar theatres of operations, be they intellectual or managerial. The challenge is no longer to grasp uncertainty at the margins of a strong core of knowledge. One is instantly confronted with the unknown, with territories where cardinal hypotheses no longer have purchase.\n",

When proposed, it applied to a few difficult issues; it now appears useful and even necessary to grasping the vast majority of our challenges in the crisis field. The basic idea is that the bulk of our conceptual and operational toolbox is designed to deal with tame problems: those that can be precisely defined, whose causes can be specified, that can be resolved by gathering additional data, by breaking them down into smaller problems, and by applying specific remedial techniques (Camillus, 2008). The basic vision is of the engineering type: the challenge is to find the best technical responses.

The search for solutions never stops, there is no ultimate test of a solution since any response generates unexpected consequences, and each implemented solution has consequences that cannot be undone. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem. Rittel and Webber put it bluntly: \u2018the classic paradigm of science and engineering \u2013 the paradigm that has underlain modern professionalism \u2013 is not applicable to the problems of open societal systems\u2019 (Rittel & Webber, 1973, p. 160) Uncertainty is global on every single component of the issue, with regard to all the outcomes of any action. Judgment becomes crucial. Fundamental values also become part of the problem, and elusive when called upon to ground a given analysis, decision or implementation. The probabilistic approach becomes ineffective. Every single move triggers possible global mutations within the system and within its global context, trial and error strategies are no longer appropriate: every move is a one off move.",

Such a preliminary confession appears to be essential to acquiring a kind of scientific royal warrant. Take, for example, James A. Robinson, who scathingly opens his article \u2018Crisis\u2019 in the International Encyclopedia for Social Sciences with: \u2018 \u201cCrisis\u201d is a lay term in search of a scholarly meaning\u2019 (Robinson, 1968, p. 510). The bill of indictment is well known: a term \u2018gutted from within\u2019 (Morin, 1976, p. 149), an \u2018empty shell, a ready\u2010to\u2010use catch\u2010phrase\u2019 (B\u00e9jin & Morin, 1976, p. 1), \u2018a convenient clich\u00e9\u2019 (Starn, 1976, p. 13), \u2018a vulgar and hollow little word\u2019 (Morin, 1976, p. 163); \u2018a very useful word in the age of mass media\u2019 since \u2018it creates emotion without requiring reflection\u2019. (Starn, 1976, p. 13). Nothing here is all that new. Historian Randolf Starn points out that as early as 1860, an Italian lexicographer decried the abuse of the medical term \u2018crisis\u2019 (Starn, 1976, p. 7). However, such accusations and regrets are not false, especially with the growing importance of the mass media, so fond of the little word. As Mike Granatt (2011) put it recently: \u2018The word \u201cCrisis\u201d has replaced \u201cEmergency\u201d just because it is shorter, hence a much better fit for the media format\u2019.

Demanding that crisis should fit into univocal, non\u2010hybrid, clear\u2010cut definitions, accepted by all and quietly settle into fixed nomenclatures, is just one more sign showing how we refuse to accept and enter crisis territory. Mitroff, Murat, and Green (2004, p. 176). are right when they underline: \u2018It is our contention that crisis management deals with problems that are inherently ill\u2010structured. \u2026 To insist, therefore, on agreement as a precondition for studying ill\u2010structured problems, is to ignore and to deny their basic nature. It is to misinterpret them ontologically. When crisis management experts call for agreement on the definition of basic terms, in effect, they are committing the same kind of error that we accuse practitioners of making when they ignore the complexity of crises\u2019 Inherently, the crisis field is the world of the ill\u2010structured, the intractable and the \u2018wicked\u2019. Even if it is useful to explore, find and use formulations that help to shape and consolidate approaches of the crisis phenomenon, it is necessary to state a preliminary and basic condition: \u2018crisis\u2019 will resist any attempt to be \u2018defined\u2019. Moreover, the underlying principle to be laid down should be that any request for a definitive, clear and univocal definition of the concept should be understood as a cognitive and psychic refusal to genuinely accept and explore crisis territory.\nClassification. \n\nCrisis literature is marked by constant efforts to deliver typologies (natural, technological, social), segmentations (internal, external, technical, organizational), time scaling (before, during, after), categories (from product defects to international crises, etc.) and myriads of crisis components, in a kind pointillist picture helping to fix at least some part of this elusive reality. All these attempts to characterize the crisis phenomenon are interesting and useful, if only they do not strive to reach an erroneous objective. In crisis territory, more than in any other, a typology can help to clarify \u2013 a little \u2013 the theatre of operations, but must not dream of locking it down. Mutating, elusive realities do not let themselves be taken prisoner.\n",

Obviously, this is extremely tiring for us, as if we were still the disciples of the naturalists of the 18th century: \u2018Causes which result in effects which are rare, violent and sudden must not affect us, they are not part of the ordinary process of Nature. Our causes and reasons are the effects that occur each day, movements that follow one another, effects that are continually renewed and endlessly repeated\u2019 (Buffon, 1749).\nMeasure. \n\nCrisis studies and theory of crisis management have developed in the wake of risk analysis. The conventional view is that crisis develops when risk control has failed, when \u2018residual risks\u2019 have taken their toll. The good news is that the whole is clearly measured, with probabilities. And crisis lies in a residual territory, limited in essence. The new theatre of operations in the risk domain compels us to step outside of this vision of \u2018residual accidents\u2019. The ingredients of a new vision are pointed up, but with caution, in Bernstein's (1996) \u2018Remarkable story of risks\u2019. The conquest of the crepuscular territory of risks has been extraordinary throughout the centuries but many \u2018details\u2019 that could have been ignored in the past now rush back to centre stage as we enter a much more complex, turbulent, volatile world. Dice throwing follows regularities \u2026 \u2018if the dice is honest\u2019 (Cardano, p. 45). Nature follows regularities, but \u2026 \u2018only for most of the part\u2019 (Leibnitz, p. 4). \u2018Players can anticipate processes, as long as \u2026 they stick to the rules upon which they agreed at the outset.\u2019 (Pascal, p. 67). The issue is that such difficulties, marginal in a stable, controlled and compartmentalized world, are capable of overwhelming the whole landscape in a globalized, volatile and turbulent world. This is exactly Bernstein's ultimate point: the cosmology of risks, and hence of crises, could mutate since \u2018Discontinuities, irregularities and volatilities seem to be proliferating rather than diminishing\u2019 (p. 329) \u2013which justifies the title of the conclusion: \u2018Awaiting wildness\u2019 (p. 329).\n",

We can multiply the fields considered, each with their relevance, specificity and dynamics. We work at the outset, where the vision is plural and where one must be able to operate multiple levers of action at the same time.\nFrom a temporal point of view, it becomes possible to work on speed and evolutions, even mutations, in new ways. For example, instantaneous dynamics (type social networks) and fast dynamics (radio and television), can all be linked to the same building blocks. One is not limited to a single timeline approach, but is allowed to immediately think of many overlapping timelines that have different dynamics and fundamental building blocks such as contradictions, oppositions, factors of evolution and mutations, that blur the view of actors who have different perspectives.\nFrom an actor's point of view, the individual, family, organization, country, etc., find their place, taking into account that everyone has different information, different perceptions of the same information or different information.\nFrom the point of view of \u2018making sense\u2019, one can also escape reductive simplistic visions and make room for multiple subjective \u2018sense making processes\u2019.\n",
