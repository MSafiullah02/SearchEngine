            "text": "A time-series analysis using a generalized additive model (GAM) was used to calculate adjusted relative risks (ARRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), because most epidemiological air pollution studies (cited in the second paragraph of the article) used this approach. The model was controlled for daily mean temperature, relative humidity, and mean air pressure, which were treated as continuous variables, as well as for the day of the week. The basic model is as follows: Log [E(Y)] = \u03b20 + S1(X1) + S2(X2) + \u22ef + Sp(Xp) + \u03b2(PM2.5), where Y is the daily number of emergency department visits for psychiatric diseases, X1, \u2026, Xp are covariates, S\ni() is a nonparametric smoother, and PM2.5 is the mean value for the corresponding day. A total of 4 degrees of freedom were selected to smooth the time trends. We examined the concentrations of the individual lag days 1 through 3 (lag 1 represents the PM2.5 level one day prior to the emergency room visit, lag 2 is the previous day, and so on). We tested the association between PM2.5 and all emergency psychiatric diseases and subgroups of emergency psychiatric diseases (F20 to F50) to calculate the ARRs (95% CIs) using the GAM model described above. All statistical analyses for the GAM data processing were performed using the SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",
