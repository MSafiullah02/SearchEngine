In California, the yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitalis), for example, dominates more than 4 million ha of northern grassland in the state, resulting in the total loss of this once productive forage system (Campbell 1994) . In addition, the European cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) is dramatically altering the vegetation and fauna of many natural ecosystems in the western US. Cheat grass is an annual that has invaded and spread throughout the shrub-steppe habitat of the Great Basin in Idaho and Utah, predisposing the altered habitat to fires (Kurdila 1995) . Before the invasion of cheat grass, fire burned once every 60 to 110 years, and shrubs in the region had a chance to become reestablished. Currently, fires occur once every 3 to 5 years, and this has led to a decrease in shrubs and other vegetation, and the occurrence of monocultures of cheat grass on more than 5 million ha in Idaho and Utah. The reason that the alteration of original vegetation is so significant is that all the animals and microbes that were dependent on the original vegetation have been reduced or totally eliminated.",

Some countries with a rapidly increasing population, growing population movement, and increasing global trade, such as the United States, are suffering a greater problem from invaders than is the case for other nations. Approximately 500,000 species of plants, animals, and microbes have invaded the nations of the world, with about 50,000 in the US alone. It must be pointed out that, for all nations combined, about 5 % of all these species were intentionally introduced as crops and livestock. Unfortunately, an estimated 10-20 % of the introduced species are, or have become, pests and are causing major environmental problems. Although relatively few of these species become really serious pests, some species do inflict significant damage to natural and managed ecosystems, and cause serious public health problems. Various ecological factors help exotic species become abundant and emerge as serious ecological threats in their new habitat. These factors include exotic plant and animal species being introduced without their natural enemies (e.g., purple loosestrife); the existence of favorable predator-prey conditions in the new habitat (e.g., for house cats); the development of new associations between alien parasites and hosts (e.g., HIV/AIDS and humans); the occurrence of disturbed habitats that promote invasion by some species (e.g., crop weeds); the occurrence of favorable, newly created artificial habitats for invasives (e.g., cheat grass); and the occurrence of species-specific traits promoting invasion by highly adaptable alien species (e.g., the water hyacinth and zebra mussel).",

This amounts to about 5 % of the world GNP (USCB 2004 (USCB -2005 . Unfortunately, precise economic costs associated with some of the most ecologically damaging species of invasives are not available. For example, cats and pigs have been responsible for the extinction of various animals, and perhaps some plants. For these invasive animals, however, only minimal cost impact data are available. In addition, it is impossible to assess the value attached to various species that have been forced to extinction. If economic values could be assigned to species forced to extinction, then in terms of losses in biodiversity, ecosystem services, and esthetics, the costs of destructive invasive species would be extremely high. The value of $ 1.4 trillion cited above already suggests that exotic species are extracting major environmental and economic tolls worldwide.",

These alien crops (e.g., corn and rice) and livestock (e.g., cattle and poultry) are vital to maintaining world agriculture and the food system. The food system has an estimated value of $ 30 trillion worldwide. However, these benefits do not compensate for the enormous negative impacts of exotic pest species. A real challenge lies in preventing further damage from invading exotic species to natural and managed ecosystems of the world. This is especially true in view of rapid population growth and increasing global trade. The United States has taken a few steps to protect and prevent the invasion of exotic species into the nation. Many governments of other nations have taken, and are taking, additional steps to combat non-indigenous species. Evidently, it is being increasingly recognized that investing a few million dollars to prevent future introduced species from invading a country, where they might cause billions of dollars worth of damage and control costs, is worthwhile.",

In the past, where vertebrate species such as mammals, amphibians, birds, and fishes were introduced for biological control, several became pests themselves (Chaps. 2 and 23). For instance, the Indian mongoose, introduced for rat control in the West Indian Islands and Hawaiian Islands, and the English sparrow, introduced into the US for caterpillar control, have both turned out to be disasters. However, introductions of insect species, such as the vedalia beetle Rodolia cardinalis into the US, and of a virus species for the control of the European rabbit in Australia, have been notable successes. Controls of cacti in Australia, knapweed in the US, and the cassava mealy bug in Africa, all employing biocontrol insects, have also been successful.",

This is sometimes successful, but not always. There have been almost as many successful biological controls employing new associated biocontrol agents. In new associated biocontrol, the biological control agents are sought from a related species of the pest invasive in another country. The new association biocontrol agent offers an ecological advantage because the biocontrol agent has never interacted with the invasive pest species, and often this advantage makes the new biocontrol agent highly pathogenic to the invasive pest species. The advantage of biological controls is that they reduce the invasive pest species without the need for using pesticides in the new ecosystem, and with minimal or no damage to the new ecosystem (Hokkanen and Pimentel 1989) . Details on the pros and cons of biological control are given in Chap. 23.",
