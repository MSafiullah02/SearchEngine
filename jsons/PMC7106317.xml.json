Those with bacterial co-infection required ventilation for longer than those with RSV infection only (p\n < 0.01).",

Wheeze rarely occurs in isolation in children and cough \u00b1 shortness of breath are also commonly found. A Danish study24 investigated approximately 3000 children aged 5 years using a parental questionnaire addressing respiratory symptoms in the previous 12 months. It reported that during this time 19.4% had one episode of wheeze, 14.4% had more than one episode of wheeze and, of those with recurrent wheeze, 25.7% also had recurrent cough.

            "text": "The COAST (Childhood Origin of Asthma) study27 prospectively evaluated the contribution of viral respiratory infections to the development of recurrent wheezing during infancy in a high-risk cohort. It enrolled 289 newborns with at least one parent with respiratory allergies and/or a history of asthma from November 1998 to May 2000 and followed them for 1\u20133 years. All infants had nasopharyngeal mucus samples collected during clinic visits at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months and during times of acute respiratory illness. These were analysed for RSV, rhinovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1\u20134, adenovirus and picornavirus. In the third year of life, there were 180 wheezy illness episodes among 76 infants, with a virus identified in 62%. The rates of detection of the individual viruses were comparable to other studies, with most illness episodes due to rhinovirus (76 of 180; 42%) and each of the other viruses contributing significantly fewer (RSV 8.5%, parainfluenza 8%, adenovirus 1%, influenza 1%, rhinovirus 1%, picornavirus 0.5%). Wheezing due to rhinovirus during the first year was the strongest single predictor of subsequent third-year wheezing, with 63% of infants with wheezing due to rhinovirus infection in the first year continuing to wheeze in years 1\u20133 compared to 20% with wheezing in the first year due to other viruses (OR 6.6).27 For all viral aetiologies there was a direct association between severity of respiratory illness in the first year (especially if associated with wheezing) and subsequent year 3 wheezing. However, frequency of respiratory illnesses in the first year did not predict wheezing at 3 years. This suggests that the strongest predictor of PSRW is a severe wheezing illness with rhinovirus in the first year of life. Other risk factors for recurrent wheezing in infants include prematurity, birthweight <2nd or >99th centile, family history of atopy, male gender, overcrowding, older siblings, attending day care, maternal smoking (especially during pregnancy) and reduced lung function at 2 weeks of age.",

            "text": "Three reviews including a total of 22 studies (Table 2\n) have looked at the association between RSV bronchiolitis in infancy and subsequent recurrent wheezing.28, 29, 30 The first review in 2000 by Bont et al.\n28 included 13 prospective follow-up studies with a total of 1161 infants followed for up to 14 years after initial infection in the first 2 years of life. In 11 of the 13 studies where cases were hospitalized, i.e. moderate to severe bronchiolitis, they found a strong association between bronchiolitis in infancy and subsequent development of wheezing. Semple and Smyth29 reviewed the literature in 2006 and found five additional studies published since the Bont review, again showing the same association. In 2007, a systematic review by Perez-Yarza et al.\n30 investigated whether RSV respiratory infections in the first 36 months of life were associated with the development of episodes of recurrent wheezing/asthma. This review included 12 studies, five of which were not included in the review by Semple and Smyth. There were four main outcomes:1.Parental reporting of recurrent wheezing was reported in eight of 12 studies and five of these showed no association between RSV bronchiolitis and parental reporting of wheezing. For the remaining three, there was an association between RSV bronchiolitis in early life and the subsequent development of recurrent wheezing but the quality of some of these studies was questioned. The study by Stein et al.\n31 from the Tucson group was a well-designed prospective population-based study and showed that children with bronchiolitis had an increased risk of wheezing until 10 years of age, with most resolving by the age of 13 years, and there was no association with atopy.2.Physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing was reported in three of 12 studies. All three showed an association between RSV bronchiolitis and physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing which decreased with increasing age and was not associated with atopy.3.Physician-diagnosed asthma was reported in eight of 12 studies with six of these showing an association. The longest study was by Korppi et al.\n32 who followed up infants for 18\u201320 years and found an increased risk of asthma or allergen sensitization in those children who had been hospitalized with RSV-positive bronchiolitis but were not atopic. These young adults had reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).4.Allergen sensitization, defined as a positive skin prick test and/or food-specific IgE levels, was reported in eight of 12 studies. In five of these the data were not conclusive. The study by Sigurs et al.\n33 found an association between RSV bronchiolitis and the development of allergic asthma in later life with the presence of raised serum IgE antibodies or positive skin prick tests post RSV bronchiolitis in children aged 13 years. All children in this study had been hospitalized with bronchiolitis.\n",

Data from the Tucson Birth Cohort38 have shown that lung function in early adulthood, measured at a mean of 10.9 years, 16.8 years and 21.7 years, could be predicted by maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC) in infancy (mean 2.3 months). Infants in the lowest percentile quarter for VmaxFRC had lower FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF25\u201375 and FEV1 up to the age of 22 years, even after adjustment for height, weight, age and sex, than those in the upper three quartiles. Over the following years the rate of decline in FEV1 to early adulthood was greater for those infants who had had viral-induced wheeze than for those with wheeze suggestive of asthma or those without any respiratory symptoms.39 These observations may be accounted for in a number of ways. It may be that both early and later symptom complexes (including asthma) are manifestations of the same airways abnormality or disease. Early onset may either be a result of environmental factors or predisposition due to inherent susceptibility. This is slightly different from the hypothesis that, although the airways disorder/disease is the same at all ages, viral infections at this age in high-risk individuals present as wheezing disorders, i.e. RSV infection in a predisposed infant will cause bronchiolitis but in a lower risk infant will cause an upper respiratory tract infection alone. A very different explanation for these findings is that the events associated with early-onset illness cause either airway damage and remodelling of the lung and/or modulate the immune response to viruses and that these changes lead to later airway disease. Unravelling these mechanisms is currently the focus of a number of research groups worldwide.",

Infection of epithelium cells by RSV during bronchiolitis has been shown to activate their NF-\u03ba\u03b2 pathway. This leads to the induction of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, e.g. CCL-5, CCL-2, CCL-3, CXCL-8,40 CXCL-6,41 tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b142 and CXCL-10,43 with the subsequent recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocyte subsets into the airways.

Although not yet shown in vivo, in vitro infection of DCs leads to the expression of viral proteins, upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and increased apoptosis.54 Human cord blood DCs infected in vitro with RSV showed an increased production of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-11 and prostaglandin (PG)E2 and a lower production of IL-12 compared to those infected with influenza. This shows that, although DCs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both bronchiolitis and PSRW, their response is virus specific.55\n",

When RSV-infected mice were depleted of NK cells, they had prolonged shedding of the virus, showing that NK cells are important in viral clearance.60 The response to RSV was evaluated in older mice who showed diminished NK cell activity and cytotoxic T-cell response, demonstrating that age-related or acquired immune dysfunction in the NK pathway leads to a more severe response to infection.58 Clinical studies of NK cells are difficult due to the problems in isolating them. In infants with severe RSV disease, NK cells have an increased expression of granzyme B, suggesting they are activated and modulating cell death pathways.61\n",

In a mouse study73 comparing wild-type and IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice, IFN-\u03b3 production in the former during initial infection prevented re-infection with RSV and subsequent development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, unlike in the IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice.73 The COAST study74 looked at the innate immune system at birth and followed the infant cohort through to 3 years of age to see if any abnormalities were predictive of subsequent respiratory disease. There was an inverse relationship between neonatal cord blood phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced IFN-\u03b3 responses and the number of moderate and severe viral infections per year. Vigorous secretion of IFN-\u03b3 in the cord blood was associated with fewer viral infections in the first three years of life. There was no association with other PHA-induced responses, including CXCL-5, CXCL-10 and CXCL-13. Differences in IFN-\u03b3 secretion were found to be gender specific with boys having greater responses than girls.75 This suggests that antenatal factors are important in determining susceptibility to PSRW and later development of asthma by reducing production of IFN-\u03b3.",
