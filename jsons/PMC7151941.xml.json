Illness among rescue teams or volunteers to natural disaster areas is reported only anecdotally. The only study known that has focused solely on the morbidity of the staff deployed in a field hospital was done during the deployment of the Israeli Defense Force field hospital to Nepal following the 2015 earthquake. Gastrointestinal (GI) complaints were by far the most common, with 53% of the entire staff affected. The group concluded that despite practicing in a stand-alone and well-equipped facility, prevention of GI problems was very difficult.13 Thus, critical to all aid missions is careful briefing with regard to the challenges of food and water hygiene. A structured guideline may simplify the short preparation phase, as summarized in the experience of the Israeli Defense Force field hospital to the Philippines following the 2013 tsunami.12\n",

Although NGO travelers had better knowledge about the transmission route of malaria, no difference was observed in their knowledge regarding means of prevention or symptoms requiring prompt medical consultation.10 Furthermore, even medical doctors and nurses working for prolonged periods in malaria-risk areas are reluctant to take long-term malaria prophylaxis. In a study in a health care setting in Equatorial Guinea, including 108 Western medical staff and their families, almost half (n = 49) chose not to take any malaria chemoprophylaxis.18 This report of poor adherence to malaria prophylaxis should prompt research efforts toward more realistic and safe chemoprophylactic regimens. Preliminary reports examining the efficacy of twice-per-week prophylaxis with atovaquone-proguanil in long-term travelers to West Africa offer a potentially easy solution using a medication that is currently available.18 Studies substantiating such user-friendly regimens are needed.",
