As intrabodies are derived from the virtually unlimited repertoire of antibodies, there are basically no limitations on the choice of target molecule. Other strategies for the inactivation of specific intracellular proteins are being developed. Among these, RNA interference (RNAi) is generating growing interest. The RNAi approach, however, is limited by incomplete RNA cleavage, inaccessible RNA sequences and proteins with a long half-life. In addition, RNAi cannot be used to target specifically individual protein\u2013protein interactions or post-translational modifications of proteins. With intracellular antibodies, it is possible to develop a reagent that prevents particular associations but spares others. Last but not least, once an intrabody has been developed, able to inhibit a cellular function, it provides a direct biochemical handle on the recognized protein and its binding partners. Intrabodies have therefore a great added value for functional proteomics and the study of protein\u2013protein interactions.",

Moreover, it became clear that being a \u201cgood intracellular antibody\u201d requires the concomitant optimization of a complex list of properties, including stability, in vivo half-life, solubility, propensity to aggregate, affinity and specificity (Cattaneo and Biocca, 1999). A \u201cgood intracellular antibody\u201d is defined as an antibody that is able to fold tolerating the conditions found in the cell cytoplasm and to have an affinity high enough to interact effectively with its target antigen. Rather than attempting to rationally engineer antibodies with these properties, we showed recently that in vivo selection processes can be applied to rapidly and effectively select intrabodies against several targets Visintin et al., 1999, Visintin et al., 2002, Tse et al., 2002. This yeast two-hybrid-based technology named Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology (IACT) (Visintin et al., 2002) proved to be a valuable method for the selection of intracellular antibodies on the basis of their ability to bind antigen intracellularly. Most importantly, we and others showed that the selection of an antibody by IACT is a good and reliable predictor for being a reliable intrabody in mammalian cells Visintin et al., 1999, Visintin et al., 2002, Tse et al., 2002.",

            "text": "The development of IACT may therefore overcome the severe bottleneck that limited the exploitation of intracellular antibodies as the technology of choice for large-scale protein knockout studies in cells, and therefore for functional proteomics. It is therefore very important to further optimize the selection procedure to isolate validated intracellular antibodies and to remove residual limitations to the present selection technologies. In its present implementation, IACT uses sources of antibody variable regions genes that have been independently generated (Fig. 1)\n. In these repertoires, \u201cgood intracellular antibodies\u201d are a subset of the total antibody repertoire. The large size of these libraries, together with the limited efficiency of DNA transformation in yeast cells (required for the intracellular selection step), requires necessarily some preselection or enrichment step, in order to reduce the size of the input library to a complexity compatible with its downstream expression in yeast cells. Indeed when making intracellular antibody libraries for IACT selection, V genes might be derived from lymphocytes which may have undergone antigen stimulation (Vascotto et al., submitted for publication) or from the results of a phage antibody library selection (Visintin et al., 2002). In the former case, antigen immunization represent the enrichment step (Vascotto et al., submitted for publication) while in the latter case one cycle of in vitro panning on antigen columns is required (Visintin et al., 2002). High-throughput \u201cfrom gene to intrabody\u201d approaches would require immunization or preselection to be bypassed.",

In general, the larger than the library, the higher the chance is to isolate specific antibodies with good binding characteristics (in terms of affinity) Perelson and Oster, 1979, Griffiths et al., 1994. It has been shown that libraries containing about 107 independent clones yielded antibodies to proteins with affinities in the low micromolar range, similar to those obtained in a primary immune response in vivo, while larger antibody libraries of 109\u20131010 clones yielded specific antibodies with affinities in the nanomolar range, similar to those obtained after a secondary immune response Griffiths et al., 1994, Vaughan et al., 1996, Sheets et al., 1998. It is also obvious that the real diversity of a library must take into account the number of correctly assembled scFv, the number of frame shift, deletions or stop codons present in the V gene sequences and other quality related factors (Knappik et al., 2000). Therefore the important parameter is the diversity of functional antibodies in the library, rather than the nominal diversity of the library. This parameter must be evaluated for all the libraries constructed. Indeed non-functional antibody fragments drastically lower the true size of the library, normally evaluated by counting the number of colonies after DNA transformation.",

For example, the affinity of Pro-rich peptide sequences for the SH3 domain is relatively weak (5\u2013100 \u03bcM) Dalgarno et al., 1997, Zucconi et al., 2001, suggesting that an intracellular inhibitor would not need a very high affinity to compete with the ligand\u2013SH3 interaction motifs. We demonstrated that intracellular antibodies with affinities in the range of 100 nM could effectively divert their target antigens from their natural intracellular environments thereby inhibiting it (Visintin et al., 2002). In general, intracellular antibodies with affinity in the micromolar/nanomolar range have been shown to be effective intracellular inhibitors (Cattaneo and Biocca, 1997). In fact, choosing an antibody based on a higher affinity in vitro alone is a poor predictor of its function as an intrabody in vivo and half-life and stability of intracellular antibodies have been shown to be more relevant for good intracellular inhibition than affinity per se (Zhu et al., 1999), Rajpal and Turi, 2001, Arafat et al., 2000. In addition, the precise subcellular targeting of antibodies increases the local concentration of the two interactors, compensating for lower affinity.",

In some situations, it may be useful to push the selection conditions further, to fish out very strong binders and to improve the stringency of selections. To this aim, we engineered a modified LexA bait: the bacterial LexA protein of pMIC-BD1 vector was modified (mLexA) to abolish its intrinsic NLS, as previously described (Rhee et al., 2000)\n(Fig. 3). In this modified format, the NLS is provided only by the antibody \u201cprey\u201d vector. To verify whether it would be possible to screen SPLINT also with antigen expressed only in the yeast cytoplasm (as in the case with the pMIC-BD2 vector), we chose the protein K-RAS as target antigen. The choice of RAS was also due to the apparent difficulty of isolating intracellular antibodies in the standard selection procedure (Table 2). In this modified selection procedure, the interaction between the antigen and the scFv must occur in the cytoplasm, because the antigen is expressed in yeast cells without the intrinsic nuclear localization signal of lexA. ScFv and antigen interact in the cell cytoplasm before the complex is translocated into the nucleus and activates transcription (Fig. 7)\n. We tried in parallel the selection of anti K-RAS antibodies as lexA-bait fusion protein with or without nuclear localization signal. In both cases, we obtained the same number of functional anti K-RAS intracellular antibodies.",

This might indicate that the antigen has difficulty entering into the nucleus, and this difficulty interferes with the normal selection procedure. Alternatively, interference with the endogenous RAS protein, by the selected antibodies, possibly due to the expected anti proliferative effect of the anti RAS antibodies, might explain this low number of colonies obtained from this selection.

This certainly contrasts with the well-established observation Visintin et al., 2002, Tse et al., 2002 that a very high proportion of ELISA-positive antigen-specific scFv fragments isolated from phage display libraries fail to pass the in vivo IACT selection against the same antigen. How can we interpret these results? First of all, it is possible (although unlikely) that phage display selects antibodies that are particularly unsuitable for intracellular expression, as opposed to antibodies that are directly derived from natural repertoires, with no intermediate selection. Second, unfolded or aggregating antibodies certainly provide a growth disadvantage to cells, and this is likely to contribute a background of antigen-independent selection that provides an enrichment for functional intrabodies in the SPLINT library, which are then selected in an antigen-dependent way. Third, the relatively lower affinity requirement for intrabodies reduce the size of the library necessary to isolate intracellular binders. Fourth, it is well established that half the antibodies expressed in human early B cell compartments are polyreactive, and a high proportion of the polyreactive antibodies are counterselected during B cell differentiation (Wardemann et al., 2003). A high frequency of polyreactive clones in the na\u00efve antibody population used to construct the present SPLINT could in part explain the success in isolating antibodies against all antigens, although our secondary screening results (see Fig. 5) show that specific antibodies can indeed be readily found from SPLINT. Last but not least, it is possible that the effective diversity of the library is actually higher than the initial number of yeast transformants, if more than one scFv is expressed in any given cell, and this may or may not result in further recombination events and in segregation of different scFvs in daughter cells. The latter point, presently being carefully evaluated, could easily contribute to an increase of the effective diversity by a factor 10 or more, and under the selective pressure of IACT this may then lead to the selective isolation of one antigen-specific scFv fragment.",
