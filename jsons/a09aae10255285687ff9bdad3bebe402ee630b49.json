By now, FCVB meetings are considered to be one of the most relevant exchange platforms for basic and translational cardiovascular biomedicine in Europe and beyond. The change of the name of the congress from Frontiers in Cardiovascular Biology to Frontiers in Cardiovascular Biomedicine was intended to reflect and emphasize the focus of these meetings being the facilitation of laboratory findings into clinical medicine.",

However, after a year and a half of planning and careful selection of a comprehensive scientific programme that attracted >600 registrations from all over the world, the conference had to be postponed due to the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2-virus-induced disease, COVID-19. In responding to this, ESC leaders and the FCVB core committee, including the local organizers, carefully followed and evaluated the pandemic situation that led to several restrictions in travel even within the 'borderless' Schengen zone countries of the European Union, including Hungary. With each passing day, we saw the rapid spread of COVID-19 that led to the cancellation of most flights, introduction of travel bans by government authorities, and closure of universities Europe wide. The Semmelweis University premises (including the venue of the meeting, Basic Medical Science Center of Semmelweis University) have also closed for students and non-university employees as of March 2020. Moreover, a ban on holding indoor meetings of >50 people has recently been introduced in Hungary (follow the daily up-to-date coronavirus situation in Hungary at http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/ coronavirus-heres-the-latest/).",

The programme of FCVB in 2021 will remain essentially the same as that planned for 2020; however, faculty and poster presenters will have a chance to modify abstracts and there will be a new call for Late Breaking Science to be announced in late 2020. Moreover, the programme committee will free up a slot for a session focusing on the cardiovascular effects of COVID-19. In the inaugural session, we will pay special tribute to Ign\u00e1c Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, who discovered the cause of puerperal (childbed) fever and introduced antisepsis into medical practice, the father of hygiene, widely attributed as the first person to discover the medical benefits of handwashing to prevent spread of diseases in the late 19th century-unfortunately more tangibly relevant now in the era of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, Semmelweis University, currently celebrating its 250-year anniversary, was named after Ign\u00e1c Semmelweis.",

The scientific programme has been devised in collaboration with the 13 ESC Working Groups and sister societies involved to cover the most exciting new findings and to facilitate the exploration of novel areas. There are six symposia on cutting-edge topics and also 20 'featured symposia' that combine selected abstracts with content related to pre-arranged sessions. Four of the featured symposia are joint sessions. Novel strategies related to the genetics of cardiovascular disease will be discussed in a session with the new ESC Council on Cardiovascular Genomics. There will be a joint featured symposium with the collaborative pan-European multidisciplinary network, EU-CardioRNA COST Action CA17129, on non-coding RNAs in cardiovascular diseases. We also welcome the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand and the Japanese Circulation Society, and look forward to their participation in two joint featured symposia. We have a broad range of Keynote Lectures and symposia from molecular networks of the cardiovascular diseaseome, to mechanisms linking atrial fibrillation and stroke, extracellular vesicles, novel RNA therapies, network medi-cine and big data, and the mechanisms of drug cardiotoxicity, including hidden cardiotoxicity.",

The CBCS is proud to support our young talent, and we will have two Young Investigator Award (YIA) sessions to showcase their research, with the final presentation of the winners given at the Awards and Closing Ceremony on the last day.

Then, he began to work on coronary and brain microcirculation with Professor A.G.B. Kovach. He moved from Hungary to the USA in 1982, where he was doing research at the Cerebrovascular Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania, with Martin Reivich and Britton Chance on pial microcirculation, regarding the role of adenosine, NADH level/metabolism, and spreading depression. He then moved to Tucson, Arizona where he learned from Paul C. Johnson all topics of classical in vivo microcirculation and engaged in microcirculatory network studies to understand the important complexity of the microcirculation. Then in 1987, he moved to Valhalla, New York and, with the help Gabor Kaley, he became an independent scientist. He has received several NIH and AHA grants which supported his studies on the function of microvessels of various tissues, the newly discovered vasomotor role of endothelium in vivo, and the effect of haemodynamic forces in acute and chronic conditions on the remodelling of microvascular function in vitro. He was one of the first (if not the first) who discovered in 1989 the role of wall shear stress in eliciting substantial dilation of arterioles and venules, and affecting the vasomotion of lymphatic microvessels. Later he investigated the modulation of the function of endothelium by age, gender, exercise, and various disease conditions. In 2011 he discovered that increases in flow elicit constrictions in cerebral arteries contributing thereby to the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow, and clarified the underlying molecular signalling. He has published his papers in highly esteemed journals, such as the American Journal of Physiology, Circulation Research, Circulation, Cardiovascular Research, Journal of Pathology, Hypertension, Microvascular Research, Microcirculation, and Journal of Vascular Research.",
