The steps of segmentation were briefly undertaken as follows: (1) segmentation of the whole lung: a well-established thresholding operation was used to extract the lung volume. The threshold is determined based on intensity histogram analysis of the CT images; (2) segmentation of abnormal opacity: it was conducted by means of a 3D region-growing algorithm and a histogram-based thresholding technique; (3) bronchus and pulmonary vessels were segmented: a differential geometric approach was applied to automatically segment the vascular tree and airway tree. A \u201cpuzzle game\u201d procedure acting as a \u201ccorrection\u201d operation for filtering false identifications was utilized; (4) quantitative evaluation of lesion\u2019s volume was conducted after segmentation. The quantitative parameters included the lung volume (LV), total lesion volume (TLV), and percentage of abnormal opacity volume (lesion%). The pixels in abnormal opacity were processed with histogram analysis including an illustration of pixel attenuation (CT numbers). Histogram analysis also allowed measurements of mean density (MD) and the proportion of pixels related to ground-glass opacity (GGO). The details of the algorithm used in the software have been reported in previous studies ([12\u201315]; see Fig. 1).",

In the current research, the mean density increased with the time course of infection, which was consistent with results of a previous study [9]. GGO with homogeneous density was found in early-stage group, with increased crazy-paving pattern in intermediate-stage group, and gradual consolidation in late-stage group. The evaluation of the extent of lesion is highly essential for judgment of disease progress. Additionally, in the present research, QCT was used to segment and extract the features of lesions, making the judgment of the extent of lesions more objectively and accurately.",
