There are also noninfectious causes of pharyngitis that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of \"sore throat\" syndromes. Pharyngitis may be part of the common cold and this is considered one of the most common reasons for outpatient medical consultation. Acute pharyngitis in adults is associated with Streptococcus pyogenes in 5-9% of cases with a similar number of cases in adolescents and young adults caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum. Acute pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes is always important to suspect when an individual reports with tonsillopharyngeal exudate, tender anterior cervical lymphadenitis, and fever greater than 100.4; absence of cough and coryza (ie, Centor criteria) make the possibility of group A streptococci infection likely; particularly if this occurs during winter and early spring and when it involves school-age children. Confirmation of streptococci through antigen testing and culture is recommended. Treating group A streptococci pharyngeal infection improves symptoms, prevent further transmission, prevents rheumatic fever, and probably prevent local and systemic spread of disease. Among adolescents and young adults (usually 15-18 years of age) presenting with acute pharyngitis, fever, tender cervical lymphadenopathy and a scarlatiniform rash and whose evaluation is negative for S. pyogenes or infectious mononucleosis, infection due to Archanobacterium haemolyticum should be suspected. Rapid progression to high fever, toxic appearance, drooling, and respiratory distress with no coughing May occur in children 2-5 years of age but cases are also seen in adolescents and young adults. \"Thumb sign\" which corresponds to the large swollen epiglottis is present on lateral neck radiograph Management priority is establishing an airway and antibiotic coverage including vancomycin and usually a third generation cephalosporin to cover H. influenzae or other respiratory pathogens ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 162, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 172, "text": "(Table 5.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Acute Pharyngitis"}, {"text": "The syndrome of chronic cough (>12 weeks) is also an important reason for infectious disease consultation and it can be caused by chronic smoking, post nasal drip due to chronic bacterial sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, anatomic abnormalities of the respiratory tract, drug-induced angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), pertussis, 4 asthma, and chronic interstitial lung disease.

Bronchorrhea can also be associated with lung metastases form adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, or other glands. Nonmalignant conditions include endobronchial tuberculosis, and asthma.

After the introduction of antibiotics in the 1950s, Lemierre's syndrome vanished for several decades. Interestingly, in the past two decades, there have been at least 400 cases reported in the literature through case studies and many cases are caused invasive community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus MRSA. 6 The differential diagnosis of selected odontogenic infectious syndromes and necrotizing infectious processes of the nose are discussed in Table 5.4 and  Table 5 .5, respectively.
