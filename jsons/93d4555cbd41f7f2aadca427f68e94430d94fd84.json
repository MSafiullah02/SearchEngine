The vigilance and precautions needed for COVID suspected patients in no way should be relaxed, but the fear should not preclude us from delivering appropriate care. For example, in the case of the patient that we presented, before the COVID era, most likely, he would have been referred for a further evaluation immediately. The patient has significant risk factors for coronary artery disease, with a history suggestive of chronic angina; therefore, further investigations were warranted. In the COVID era, the hesitation of the patients to go to the hospital to avoid exposure, the reservation of the providers to send their patients to the health care facilities, and the limitation of the resources, have created a significant barrier for evaluation. Even in the case of the patients who are already admitted to the hospital, when the suspicious for COVID is raised, it can affect the care either by distracting from other diagnoses or delaying the procedures to avoid the exposure. For example, in this case, while the patient was being considered for ECMO, with proper protection, an angiogram should have been performed.",

The patient was then transferred to our institution for higher level of care. The COVID-19 PCR result was negative twice by this time. After arrival at our institution, he was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab. Coronary angiogram showed severe 99% stenosis of the mid-LAD artery with TIMI2 flow, 60% long segment stenosis in the proximal LCXand the moderately diffusely diseasedRCA (Figures 52019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, China (1). The virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-s), which leads to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (2). Even though the primary manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory symptoms, some patients have severe cardiovascular damage (3). Patients with cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of death. Cardiovascular manifestations of the patients with COVID-19 include heart failure, myocarditis, arrhythmia, and elevated troponin, which can mimic STEMI or NSTEMI. In Wuhan out of 72,312 patients, 81%",
