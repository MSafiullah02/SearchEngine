The principal etiologies detected in ARIs patients were HRV (8.6%), Flu (7.3%), RSV (6.1%), hCoV (4.3%), and PIV (4.0%). Distribution of virus identification was similar not only in different type of patients but also in each of diagnosis groups. Highest detection rate (45.3%) in patients aged 1\u20105 years indicated that ARIs still was a risk factor for younger children's health, although the mortality due to respiratory tract infections decreased more than 35% in this age population.17\n",

Published reports state that RSV was a well\u2010known cause of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years and elderly,19 but less common cause in adults, although few study examined RSV as an important etiology due to Community\u2010Acquired Pneumonia in this age group.20 In contrast with previous study that hCoV primarily infect upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract,21 the result of our study that hCoV could be detected in 9.0% of all bronchitis may in part reflect it was also an important etiology for lower respiratory tract infections.",

HRV, the etiology with highest detection rate in adults, was supported by previous studies that revealed common cold were mainly caused by HRV infections for adults people.27, 28 In addition, Flu was an important virus identified in older children and elderly, which suggested influenza virus was the significant cause of ARIs for those population in relatively undeveloped region of china like Gansu province. Influenza vaccine was commercially available, such as inactivated vaccine, which was administered intramuscularly or intranasally.29, 30, 31 However, it had an extremely low coverage rate in China.32 We considered Influenza vaccine should be used in widespread areas to reduce the incidence of influenza disease in Gansu. It should be noted that PIV was a another major virus for children aged 1\u20105 years besides RSV, which was in agreement with studies conducted before.33, 34, 35 This finding indicated that local pediatricians not only took priority over RSV infections but also paid more attention to PIV, when younger children were infected with respiratory viruses.",

Minor changes about influenza seasonality resulted in annual epidemic with winter peak in temperate regions.37 This was similar to our finding that the peak of Flu infections occurred in December\u2010January. hCoV showed an epidemic season annually in summer (July\u2010August), whereas previous studies demonstrated no clearly temporal trends for hCoV infections or hCoV more prevalent in winter\u2010spring.38, 39 The difference may be resulted from geographic location and alternating pattern of viral seasonality.",
