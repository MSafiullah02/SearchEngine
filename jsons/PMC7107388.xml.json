Serum samples collected from 21 patients (for 2 patients, acute phase serum samples were not available for virologic analysis) were subjected to virus isolation and RT-PCR for amplification of the SFTSV genome. Serum samples collected from all 23 patients were tested for IgG and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SFTSV in the indirect IFA. Of the 23 patients, 8 men and 2 women received a diagnosis of SFTS: 7 had positive results of virus isolation and genome amplification tests; 1 had positive results of virus genome amplification testing and IgM antibody to SFTSV but had negative results of virus isolation analysis; and 2 were positive for IgG antibody to SFTSV. In the present study, the 2 patients who tested positive for SFTSV on the basis of detection of IgG to SFVSV were regarded as SFTS positive because their symptoms were reminiscent of SFTS and because reports of asymptomatic cases in China are quite rare [23, 24]. For the purposes of the present study, the first patient was included with the 10 retrospective cases, for a total of 11 diagnosed cases.\n",

However, no viral antigens were detected in hepatocytes or in the parenchymal cells of the adrenal glands. Viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, which includes the Rift valley fever virus, Hantaan virus, and Heartland virus [10], infect monocytes/macrophages [25, 26]. These cells may control the spread (or containment) of viruses to cells within other organs.
