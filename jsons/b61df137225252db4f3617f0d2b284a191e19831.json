We consider the case in which the nodes in the network change their links due to social mixing dynamics as well as in response to the disease. The model shows the behavior that, as we increase social mixing, disease spread is inhibited in certain cases, while in other cases it is enhanced. We also extend this dynamic network model to take into account the case of hidden infection. Here we find that, as expected, the disease spreads more readily if there is a time period after contracting the disease during which an individual is infective but is not known to have the disease.",

With the growth of the field of complex networks, there have been a number of studies on infection spreading on networks with nontrivial properties [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Typically, the underlying network in epidemic-spreading models is considered to be static. One can then study the effect of network structure on disease propagation. While the assumption of a static network may work well for cases in which the topology of the network does not change significantly during the course of the spreading process, in general we cannot neglect the fact that human contacts evolve over time. Depending on the disease and the type of contacts in which we are interested, the time scales for the change of human contacts and the spread of an epidemic may vary. To take into account the changing contacts of individuals, many researchers have considered disease spread on networks in which links change over time [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

The proposed model tries to capture some of the important features of the dynamics of real human networks. In this model, social mixing dynamics and disease evasion causes change in network topology. Social mixing results in the constant evolution of contacts, which is independent of the disease status of the nodes, while disease evasion causes suppression of susceptible-infected links in the network due to the avoidance of infected nodes by the susceptible nodes. We study SIR disease on such dynamic networks where, at any given time, the nodes could be in one of the three possible states, namely susceptible (S), infective (I ), and removed (R). Here, R represents the state in which the node is removed from the network and no longer takes part in any kind of dynamics. The model considers the case of imperfect evasion where susceptible nodes cannot avoid infected nodes completely when new connections are formed in the network. This is in contrast to other models where, after the susceptible-infected links are broken, either the broken links are removed or susceptible nodes reconnect the broken links to noninfected nodes in the network [12] [13] [14] . In our study, we focus on how the above-mentioned network dynamics influences the value of disease transmission probability above which the disease infects a finite fraction of the population in the limit of infinite system size.",

Due to social dynamics, we assume that the nodes delete their links randomly, independent of their disease status. To account for this, each existing link in the network is deleted with a constant probability \u03c6.

Thus the number of partners that a node seeks is equal to the number of its deleted links. While searching for new partners, we assume that the nodes mix randomly. In the mixing population, a node could appear more than once and the multiplicity of a node in equal to the number of its deleted links. While mixing, a node has an equal chance of meeting any other node, independent of their disease status. However, we differentiate between nodes meeting each other and actually forming a new link. When nodes with the same disease status meet (i.e., a potential S-S or I -I link), they form a new link with probability 1. When nodes with a different disease status meet (i.e., a potential S-I link), due to disease evasion, the link is formed with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b7 2 , where \u03b7 2 is a second evasion parameter. This is the case of imperfect evasion where the susceptible nodes avoid getting infected by deleting their links with the infected neighbors, but while searching for new partners there is again a chance of the formation of new susceptible-infected links. When a pair of susceptible and infected nodes is rejected (with probability \u03b7 2 ), the rejected pair move to the next time step to search for partners.

Thus, for a given value of transmission probability, we expect the disease to infect a higher number of nodes compared to the case when we do not have hidden infection. Figure 7 shows the results from simulations for different hidden periods of infectivity \u03c4 1 but fixed total period of infectivity \u03c4 , which was set to five time steps. We fixed the other parameters of the dynamic network model as \u03c6 = 0.1, \u03b7 1 = 0.4, and \u03b7 2 = 0.4. As expected, with increasing \u03c4 1 , the transition point shifts toward lower values of \u03bb. For the chosen parameters, when \u03c4 1 = 0, the transition point is larger than that for the static network, but for \u03c4 1 = 5 the transition point for the dynamic network is smaller than that for the static network.

Incorporating the effects of changing network topology due to disease-independent mixing (social mixing dynamics) as well as disease evasion makes the model more meaningful. In our dynamic network model with both social dynamics and disease evasion (Sec. II), we find that, in certain cases, the value of the transmission probability at which the epidemic first occurs increases with increased mixing (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) . In other words, as social mixing increases, disease spread is inhibited [ Fig. 6(a) ]. This occurs due to the suppression of susceptible-infected links when new connections are formed. When the period of infectivity is greater than 1, in certain parameter ranges we get the behavior that increased social mixing can lead to an increase in the spread of diseases. This can be seen for \u03c4 = 2 in Fig. 4 for curves with \u03b7 2 = 0.0 and 0.2.",
