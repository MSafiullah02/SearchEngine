As countries reach the infection peak, it is planned to return a new normal under different coexistence conditions in order to reduce the economic effects produced by the total or partial closure of companies, universities, shops, etc. Under such circumstances, the use of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in various facilities represents an important tool in assisting authorities to make informed decisions. On the other hand, agent-based modeling is a relatively new approach to model complex systems composed of agents whose behavior is described using simple rules. Different from classical mathematical models (which consider a homogenous population), agent-based approaches model individuals with distinct characteristics and provide more realistic results. In this paper, an agent-based model to evaluate the COVID-19 transmission risks in facilities is presented. The proposed scheme has been designed to simulate the spatiotemporal transmission process. In the model, simulated agents make decisions depending on the programmed rules. Such rules correspond to spatial patterns and infection conditions under which agents interact to characterize the transmission process. The model also includes an individual profile for each agent, which defines its main social characteristics and health conditions used during its interactions. In general, this profile partially determines the behavior of the agent during its interactions with other individuals. Several hypothetical scenarios have been considered to show the performance of the proposed model. Experimental results have demonstrated that the simulations provide useful information to produce strategies for reducing the transmission risks of COVID-19 within the facilities.",

Mathematical models have been widely used for evaluating the e ectiveness of control strategies and for reducing their associated risks [5] . Through mathematical modeling, it is possible to obtain critical information about the mechanisms of transmission and spread. It helps to highlight important factors in the disease transmission process. From its results, it is also possible to suggest preventive measures or e ective control strategies. Another important function of mathematical models is hypothesis testing [6] . Under this role, it is possible to test different scenarios considering distinct hypothetical conditions that are impossible to analyze in the real circumstances. Compared to experimental methods, the modeling schemes have the convenience of saving time and economic resources. In the last decades, the design of mathematical models for disease transmission has attracted the attention of the scientific community. Some examples include the classical Susceptible-Infect-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model established by Kermack and McKendrick [7] , the Susceptible-Infect-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model proposed by Bailey [8] , the Susceptible-Infect-Vaccination-Susceptible (SIVS) epidemic system introduced by Arion et al. [9] and the stochastic Susceptible-Infect-Quarantine-Susceptible (SIQS) epidemic model studied by Zhang et al. [10] . All these models are proper for explaining the global behavior of an epidemic on larger scales considering general variables. They are not able to provide accurate predictions at a finer resolution. There exist many scenarios in which it is important to analyze the transmission dynamics in a more microscopic way, especially in small populations or in facilities where the infection process can be identified by the interactions among their members [11] .",

            "text": "Agent-based modeling [14] represents a new paradigm to model complex systems using agents or elements. Agents maintain behaviors that are described by simple rules and influenced by the collective interaction with other agents. Under this paradigm, global behavioral patterns that have not been directly programmed emerge through the collective interaction among agents. Agent-based models attempt to relate how global regularities may emerge through processes of collective cooperation. Under this scheme, a population of agents maintains a behavior characterized by a set of simple rules. The objective of such rules is to emulate the individual movements of real actors when they interact with their local environment. Although the system is modeled from the individual point of view, its main properties are visualized from a global perspective. The powerful modeling characteristics of the Agent-based models have motivated their use in several applications which include the behavior in supply chains [15] and the stock market [16] , the characterization of the immune system [17] , the understanding about the fall of ancient civilizations [18] , the consumer purchasing behavior [19] , to name a few. Agent-based models have also been used as an alternative to classical mathematical tools to describe the behavior of diseases. These approaches produce better results in conditions where it is required to determine the dynamics of a disease in a more fine-context way, particularly when it is necessary to characterize the transmission process person-to-person [20] . As a result, several agent-based schemes have been proposed to model how the uncertainties in disease transmission change according to di erent characteristics of the population and a ects the overall behavior of epidemics [20, 21] . Some examples include studies such as [22] where it is used historical information to produce contact patterns in agent-based approaches with the objective to characterize the behavior of previous critical epidemics. In contrast, in [23] , historical data are considered to evaluate the possibilities of future disease outbreaks. In [24] , it is integrated empirical mobility data models to emulate the diffusion dynamics of global disease without considering the transmission at the level of individuals. More recently, in [25] and [26] , it is proposed two agent-based schemes which model individual contact to capture the nationwide spread of influenza in Australia and Switzerland, respectively. Both models generate an artificial population considering census data. Then, agents are influenced by some operators that simulate the transmission of influenza through the interaction of agent groups.",

Within these spaces, it is maintained a high contact rate between people sharing the same common surfaces of interaction. However, rarely there are no specific countermeasures related to these facilities nor conducted studies that analyze possible coexistent strategies. The public health consequences of acquiring COVID-19 have led many governments to impose a set of control measures. As the countries reach the infection peak, it is planned to return to the normality under new coexistence conditions in order to reduce the economic effects produced by the total or partial closure of companies, universities, shops, etc. Under such circumstances, the use of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in this type of facility represents an important tool in assisting authorities to make informed decisions. In this paper, an agentbased model to evaluate the COVID-19 transmission risks in facilities is presented. In the model, the behavior of each individual is characterized by a set of simple rules that considers its basic interactions inside the facility. In its iterations, each agent maintains different mobility requirements and contagion susceptibility. From these models, several possible scenarios can be tested to obtain the coexistence conditions that need to be imposed among the members or the habits that have to be avoided for reducing the transmission risks. Different from classical mathematical models, agent-based approaches model individuals with distinct characteristics such as mobility needs, grouping requirements, or a variety of health conditions providing more realistic results. This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the basic concepts of agent-based modeling are introduced. In Section 3, the proposed model is explained. In Section 4, the experimental results are exposed. In Section 5, the results and characteristics of the proposed method are discussed. Finally, in Section 6, conclusions are drawn.",

Each agent represents a tree or an empty space. One random agent of the lattice is considered the location in which starts the fire. Considering this agent , the next rule is applied.

In the test, it is considered a facility with the following dimensions 300 300 (> 3 0, ? 3 300, > 4 0, ? 4 300). For the simulations, it is considered the same configuration of experiment 1. In each simulation, a different value of within [10, 1000] is considered. Since agent-based models are stochastic schemes, each simulation is executed repeatedly 30 times. Figure 9 shows the average results of this experiment. After analyzing Fig. 9 , it can be seen that less than 100 individuals produce a high number of iterations, which means low transmission rates. Under such conditions, the facility is able to maintain less than 100 individuals with very low risk. On the other hand, when the number of individuals is higher than 300, the rates of transmission are practically the same. ",

The good practices considered to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 involve simple habits such as washing one's hands continuously, sneezing into one's hand or elbow and using a face mask. The observance of such simple rules reduces significatively infection probability. In the test, it is evaluated the consequences that a percentage of the agent population follows the rules and thus reduces its infection probabilities. In the experiment, at each simulation, a percentage of agents (from 0 to 100%) with low infection probability is induced in the population. Under such conditions, each agent from belongs to one of two classes: I and II. The infection probability ( ) of agents from class I is generated with random numbers between the lower (F G 0.1) and upper (H G 0.3) infection probability limits. Agents from type II have been configurated considering a low probability (0.05) and deliberately induced inside the population. The rest of the model parameters maintain the same values as experiment 1. Figure 10 shows the averaged results of this experiment (30 different independent executions). After analyzing Fig. 10 , it can be seen that more than 60% of the individuals produce a high number of iterations, which means low transmission rates.

Different from such schemes, in our approach, simulated agents make decisions depending on the programmed rules. Such rules correspond to spatial patterns and infection conditions under which agents interact to characterize the transmission process. Our model also includes a personal profile for each agent (modeled in the parameters F G , H G , F IJ , H IJ and V ), which defines its main social (spatial) and physical (health) characteristics. Agents act during the transmission process by modifying their decisions as the conditions around them change. Heterogeneity is also an essential part of our model since different agents in the same circumstances can make different decisions and the same agent in different situations can make different decisions. Even our proposed model with simple interactions (rules) and individual profiles can produce behaviors that cannot be captured and analyzed from the perspective of approaches that consider independent or passive individuals such as the SIS, SIR, SIVS and SIQS models.",

Under such conditions, details in the emulation of the transmission process are not modeled reliably by these approaches. Different from these models, our scheme defines each agent individually with its own personal profiles of infection and mobility. Therefore, our approach is able to produce detailed spatiotemporal simulations agent by agent. As a consequence, our scheme allows potentially a high representation of the transmission process being modeled. Thus, conclusions of the model behavior can be extrapolated to real-world, which allows insights from the model to be used to understand the system and compare different hypothetical scenarios. From the simulation of these scenarios, it can be obtained coexistence conditions that need to be imposed among the members or the habits that have to be avoided for reducing the transmission risks.",

In Section 4.3, the model has been tested considering different population sizes of susceptible agents ( ). In the test, a certain population size was simulated while the outbreak endpoint is registered. The main idea has been to determine the maximal capacity of individuals that the facility can maintain without presenting a high risk considering its low transmission rates. In Section 4.4, in the experiment, at each simulation, a percentage of agents (from 0 to 100%) with low infection probability is induced in the population. This condition can represent a determined number of individuals who do not follow good practices to avoid the transmission of COVID-19 (the use of a face mask). From the simulations, it can be evaluated the risk if a determined number of agents do not use the mask due to their work restrictions (the need the face free such as welders) or because they simply forget it. Therefore, it can be established penalties or strategies that avoid this bad observance. In Section 4.5, In the experiment, the model is used to evaluate the influence of restricting mobility among the individuals inside the facility. From this scenario, it can be evaluated the transmission effects produced for two different conditions. First, individuals stay in their workspace only (with local movements around this position). Second, the agents can move to other relatively far positions through the facility (such as other departments, library, dining hall, etc.). From the simulation results, it can be evaluated the risk of each mobility type in order to generate strategies that promote those mobilities that produce lower risks (eliminate the contact between certain departments, to choose only one person to deliver the product from one station to another, etc.).",

Complex rules (too much detail) are counter-productive since they obscure the connection between the agent interaction and the model behavior. One of the main characteristics of our model is simplicity. As a consequence of this simplicity, the model maintains some limitations. Since our proposed scheme is a model to evaluate the risk of infection, it does not implement the behavior of the complete disease, such as the inclusion of recovered individuals. Under such conditions, it is not possible to asses the way in which the risk decreases when recovered individuals are not able to transmit the disease. The rules implemented in our model are very simple in order to highlight the relationship between agent interaction and model behavior. As a result, several complex interactions among agents are not modeled. One case can be the influence of some individuals (skeptics) to others to act contrary to the good habits for avoiding disease transmission. Another can be the dynamic modification of the infection probability. This fact models the different risks produced for distinct health conditions (more susceptibility provoked by bad feeding or sleep disorders).",
