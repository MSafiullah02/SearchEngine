Dear Editor, We read with interest the article by Marzano and colleagues addressing the specificity of varicella-like exanthem to diagnose coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 1 . Although this type of COVID-19 associated rash is rare, the authors claim that it is more specific than others without having performed a diagnostic accuracy study 2 . This type of study would calculate the association of COVID-19 status (yes/no) with the type of exanthem (varicella-like/non varicella-like) in a predetermined number of patients (to ensure sufficient statistical power) and in a defined population with a known prevalence of COVID-19 disease.",

The positive predictive value, that is, the probability that a person with a varicella-like rash has COVID-19, is much more relevant, as a high value would justify SARS-CoV-2 testing. The positive predictive value is affected by the prevalence of the disease. Consequently, as we are going through the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is evident by applying Bayes' theorem that the conditional probability of COVID-19 given a varicella-like rash is enormous.",

In addition, at the current stage of the pandemic, COVID-19 is more frequent in adults, where varicella is not. This gives varicella-like rash additional COVID-19 positive predictive value compared to the rest of the rashes. The main factor that at this moment reduces the positive predictive value of rashes for COVID-19 is adverse drug reactions. Unfortunately, this topic is being less discussed in the literature.",
