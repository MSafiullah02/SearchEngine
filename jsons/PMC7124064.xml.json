The mold, Penicillium notatum, produced an active agent, which was named penicillin. Fleming\u2019s discovery began the microbial drug era. By using the same method, other naturally occurring substances, like chloramphenicol and streptomycin, were later isolated from bacterial fermentations. Naturally occurring antibiotics are produced by fermentation, an old technique that can be traced back almost 8,000 years, initially for beer and wine production, and recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. During the last 4,000 years, Penicillium roqueforti has been utilized for cheese production and for the past 3,000 years, soy sauce in Asia and bread in Egypt represented examples of traditional fermentations [1].",

Such a level is probably enough to allow the organism to compete with other organisms and/or coexist with other living species in nature. The industrial microbiologist, however, desires a strain that will overproduce the molecule of interest. Development of higher-producing strains involves mutagenesis and, more recently, recombinant DNA technologies [9]. Although some metabolites of interest can be made by plants or animals, or by chemical synthesis, the recombinant microbe is usually the \u201ccreature of choice.\u201d Thousandfold increases in production of small molecules have been obtained by mutagenesis and/or genetic engineering. Other important parts of industrial production include creating a proper nutritional environment for the organism to grow and produce its product, and the avoidance of negative effects such as inhibition and/or repression by carbon sources, nitrogen sources, phosphorus sources, metals, and the final product itself. Avoidance of enzyme decay is also desired [4, 10].",

They constitute a major part of the antibiotic market. Included are the penicillins, cephalosporins, clavulanic acid, and the carbapenems. Of these, fungi are responsible for production of penicillins and cephalosporins. The natural penicillin G and the biosynthetic penicillin V had a market of $4.4 billion by the late 1990s. Major markets also included semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins with a market of $11 billion. In 2006, the market for cephalosporins amounted to $9.4 billion and that for penicillins was $6.7 billion. By 2003, production of all beta-lactams had reached over 60,000 t. The titer of penicillin is over 100 g L\u22121 and that for cephalosporin C is about 35 g L\u22121 [16, 17]. Recovery yields are more than 90 %. There have been more than 15,000 molecules based on penicillin that have been made by semisynthesis or by total synthesis. By the mid 1990s, 160 antibiotics and their derivatives were already on the market [15, 18]. The market in 2000 was $35 billion. Despite these impressive figures, more antibiotics are needed to combat evolving pathogens, naturally resistant microbes, and bacteria and fungi that have developed resistance to current antibiotics. A new and approved cephalosporin is ceftobiprole, which is active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and is not hydrolyzed by a number of beta-lactamases from Gram-positive bacteria [19]. Another antibiotic of note is cerulenin, an antifungal agent produced by Acremonium caerelens. It was the first inhibitor of fatty acid biosynthesis discovered [20]. It alkylates and inactivates the active-site nucleophylic cysteine of the ketosynthase enzyme of fatty acid synthetase by epoxide ring opening. Other properties that are desired in new antibiotics are improved pharmacological properties, ability to combat viruses and parasites, and improved potency and safety.",

Many people cannot control their level of cholesterol at a healthy level by diet alone and require hypocholesterolemic agents. High blood cholesterol leads to atherosclerosis, which is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by continuous accumulation of atheromatous plaque within the arterial wall, causing stenosis and ischemia. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of human death. The last two decades have witnessed the introduction of a variety of anti-atherosclerotic therapies. The statins form a class of hypolipidemic drugs, formed as secondary metabolites by fungi, and used to lower cholesterol by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis; i.e., 3-hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Inhibition of this enzyme in the liver stimulates low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL from the bloodstream and a decrease in blood cholesterol levels. They can reduce total plasma cholesterol by 20\u201340 %. Through their cholesterol-lowering effect, they reduce risk of cardiovascular disease, prevent stroke, and reduce development of peripheral vascular disease [21].",

This first member of the group was isolated as an antibiotic product of Penicillium brevicompactum [23]. At about the same time, it was found by Endo and coworkers as a cholesterolemic product of Penicillium citrinum [24]. Although compactin was not of commercial importance, its derivatives achieved strong medical and commercial success. Lovastatin (monacolin K; mevinolin; MevacorTM), was isolated in broths of Monascus rubra and Aspergillus terreus [25, 26]. Lovastatin, developed by Merck & Co. and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987, was the first commercially marketed statin. In its chemical structure, lovastatin has a hexahydronaphthalene skeleton substituted with a p-hydroxy-lactone moiety (Fig. 1.1).\n\n",

Simvastatin is active against RNA viruses and acts as monotherapy against chronic hepatitis C virus in humans. It has been shown to act in vitro against hepatitis B virus (HBV). This virus infects 400 million people and is the most common infectious disease agent in the world. The virus causes hepatocellular cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer death. Nucleotide analogs (lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, entecavir, telbuvidine) were approved for HBV infections but they only work on 11\u201317 % of patients. Simvastatin is synergistic with these nucleotide analogs.",

The benzoyl group of the molecule is particularly crucial for maintaining the strong bioactivity of taxol. The drug also inhibits several fungi (species of Pythium, Phytophthora, Aphanomyces) by the same mechanism.

By the end of 2007, 23 anti-angiogenesis drugs were in Phase III clinical trials and more than 30 were in Phase II. Fumagillin, a secondary metabolite of Aspergillus fumigatus, was one of the first agents found to act as an anti-angiogenesis compound. Next to come along were its oxidation product ovalacin and the fumagillin analog TNP-470 (=AGM-1470). TNP-470 binds to and inhibits type 2 methionine aminopeptidase. This interferes with amino-terminal processing of methionine, which may lead to inactivation of enzymes essential for growth of endothelial cells. In animal models, TNP-470 effectively treated many types of tumors and metastases.",

Cyclosporin A was originally discovered in the 1970s as a narrow-spectrum antifungal peptide produced by the mold, Tolypocladium nivenum (previously Tolupocladium inflatum) in an aerobic fermentation [61]. Cyclosporins are a family of neutral, highly lipophilic, cyclic undecapeptides containing some unusual amino acids, synthesized by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. Discovery of the immunosuppressive activity of this secondary metabolite led to use in heart, liver, and kidney transplants and to the overwhelming success of the organ transplant field [62]. Cyclosporin was approved for use in 1983. It is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T-lymphocytes. This complex of cyclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin, which under normal circumstances is responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin-2. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and therefore leads to a reduced function of effector T-cells. Annual world sales of cyclosporin A are approximately $2 billion. Cyclosporin A also has activity against corona viruses [63].",

Bartolomeo Gosio (1863\u20131944), an Italian physician, discovered the compound in 1893 [64]. Gosio isolated a fungus from spoiled corn, which he named Penicillium glaucum, which was later reclassified as P. brevicompactum. He isolated crystals of the compound from culture filtrates in 1896 and found it to inhibit growth of Bacillus anthracis. This was the first time an antibiotic had been crystallized and the first time that a pure compound had ever been shown to have antibiotic activity. The work was forgotten but fortunately the compound was rediscovered by Alsberg and Black [65] and given the name mycophenolic acid. They used a strain originally isolated from spoiled corn in Italy called Penicillium stoloniferum, a synonym of P. brevicompactum. The chemical structure was elucidated many years later (1952) by Birkinshaw and coworkers [66] in England. Mycophenolic acid has antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, antipsoriasis, and immunosuppressive activities. Its antiviral activity is exerted against yellow fever, dengue virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus [67]. It was never commercialized as an antibiotic because of its toxicity, but its 2-morpholinoethylester was approved as a new immunosuppressant for kidney transplantation in 1995 and for heart transplants in 1998 [68]. The ester is called mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to mycophenolic acid in the body. It is sometimes used along with cyclosporin in kidney, liver, and heart transplants. Mycophenolic acid also appears to have anti-angiogenic activity [69].",

This oxygenated carotenoid pigment is used in the feed, food, and cosmetic industries. It is responsible for the orange to pink color of salmonid flesh and the reddish color of boiled crustacean shells. Feeding of pen-reared salmonids with a diet containing this yeast induces pigmentation of the white muscle [87]. It is a very good antioxidant, 10 times more active than beta-carotene and 100 times more than alpha-tocopherol. It is the second most important carotenoid. Astaxanthin enhances the immune system, and protects skin from radiation injury and cancer. It can be produced synthetically as hydroxyl-astaxanthin from petrochemicals with a selling price of $2,500 per kg. However, the natural product is favored because the synthetic product is a mixture of stereoisomers. Natural astaxanthin is more stable than the synthetic version and more bioavailable. The natural product is present in algae and fish as mono- and di-esters of fatty acids. However, it is difficult to hydrolyze the esters from algae, which limits its usage to trout and salmon. The yeast product is better since it is the 97 % free, non-esterified (3R, 3\u2019R) stereoisomer. The natural product is more expensive ($7,000 per kg) than synthetic astaxanthin ($2,500 per kg). The astaxanthin market was $219 million in 2007 with 97 % being synthetic. Most of the production processes with the yeast yield levels of astaxanthin lower than 100 mg L\u22121. However, white light improved production to 420 mg L\u22121 [88] and mutant strain UBv-AX2 can make 580 mg L\u22121 [89].",

Thaumatin is intensely sweet (i.e., 3,000 times sweeter than sucrose) and is approved as a food-grade ingredient. Production by A. niger var awamori was improved from 2 mg L\u22121 up to 14 mg L\u22121 by increasing gene dosage and use of a strong promoter [91]. The sweetener xylitol, normally produced by Pichia stipitis, can be produced by recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae in higher concentrations by transforming the XYL1 gene of P. stipitis into S. cerevisiae. The gene encodes a xylose reductase [92].",

            "text": "Microorganisms have greatly contributed for about 85 years to the development of medicine and agriculture. However, due to different situations, pathogenic microbes have become resistant to many antibiotics creating a dangerous situation and therefore the need for new antibiotics is imperative. Unfortunately, most of the large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antimicrobial compounds. Due to economics, they have concluded that drugs directed against chronic diseases offer a better revenue stream than do antimicrobial agents, for which the length of treatment is short and government restriction is likely. Some small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are still developing antibiotics but most depend on venture capital rather than sales income, and with the present regulations, face huge barriers to enter into the market. These barriers were raised with the best intentions of ensuring public safety but they are having the opposite effect; i.e., termination of antibiotic development while resistance continues to increase [93]. However, there are some new bright possibilities. One of the more promising is the utilization of uncultivated microorganisms. Considering that 99 % of bacteria and 95 % of fungi have not yet been cultivated in the laboratory, efforts to find means to grow such uncultured microorganisms is proceeding and succeeding [5]. Furthermore, researchers are now extracting bacterial DNA from soil samples, cloning large fragments into, for example, bacterial artificial chromosomes, expressing them in a host bacterium and screening the library for new antibiotics. This metagenomic effort could open up the exciting possibility of a large untapped pool from which new natural products could be discovered [94]. Another exciting possibility is that of genome mining [95]. In addition to these relatively new techniques, chemical and biological modification of old antibiotics could still supply new and powerful drugs. These comments also apply to non-antibiotics such as antitumor agents and other microbial products. In addition, natural products must continue to be tested for desirable therapeutic activities. I believe that significant progress in identifying new antibiotics, oncology therapeutics, and other useful medicines will be made, probably not by the big pharmaceutical companies, but by biotechnology companies and small research groups from institutes and universities.",
