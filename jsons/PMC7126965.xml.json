Post-infectious cough (PIC) belongs to a type of sub-acute cough, and the percentage of it is 40% \u2212 50%. Among the causes that can induce cough, the most common is represented by the infection of upper respiratory track, generally of viral origin. The most frequently implicated are picornavirus (rhinovirus and enterovirus) and coronavirus, followed by adenovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and bocavirus (Dicpinigaitis et al., 2009, Footitt and Johnston, 2009, Jones and Stewart, 2002, Pappas et al., 2008, Regamey et al., 2008). Cough is the most common and troublesome symptom during airway infections, which is a major cause of significant morbidity an indeed mortality, and may last for several weeks or even months in some patients (Jones and Stewart, 2002), that bring the patient to the doctor (Footitt and Johnston, 2009).",

Furthermore these cells release cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and oxygen free radicals that aggravate the injury of the airway structures caused by the virus (Biagioli et al., 1998, Jackson and Johnston, 2010, Rossi and Colin, 2015).",

Many patients use over-the-counter drugs, for instance, cough suppressants and expectorants/ mucolytics, which often lack a clinically proven efficacy or have some activity, but at the expense of unpleasant or intolerable side effects. Two classes of cough suppressants are available: those with central action (codeine, dextromethorphan, and cloperastine) and those acting peripherally (levodropropizine). The only expectorant capable of inhibiting the cough reflex is guaifenesin. Meanwhile common side effects from these drugs are nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, dizziness, constipation, anorexia, fatigue, sleepiness and so on. A large part of income was spent on the treatment of cough globally (Morice, 2008). However, satisfactory results of all the medicine were not achieved due to the symptomatic treatment, side effects, and relapse after treatment. Additionally, montelukast, medicaments of a gleam for treating respiratory tract infection, was unresponsive to treatment for post-infectious cough (Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, an unmet need exists for the development of an effective therapeutic approach to prevent PIC.",

Its leaves have long been used in \u201cdai\u201d ethno-pharmacy for the treatment of whooping cough (post infectious cough), chronic bronchitis, asthma, and other respiratory tract infections in Yunnan Province, PR China (Compiling Group of Yunnan Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1977). Phytochemical constituents of different parts of the plant were investigated intensively by our group (Cai et al., 2010, Cai et al., 2008a, Cai et al., 2008b, Cai et al., 2007, Chen et al., 2016, Du et al., 2007a, Du et al., 2007b, Feng et al., 2009, Feng et al., 2008, Liu et al., 2015, Pan et al., 2016, Qin et al., 2015a, Qin et al., 2015b, Xu et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2015a, Yang et al., 2015b, Yang et al., 2014a, Yang et al., 2014b, Zhang et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2005). Meanwhile, the chemical profiling and metabolites of alkaloidal extract of A. scholaris were reported (Cao et al., 2015), in which scholaricine, 19-epischolaricine, vallesamine, and picrinine were the major indole alkaloids of its leaf (\nFig. 1.), and their pharmacokinetic behavior in rats was also investigated (Zhao et al., 2017). Moreover, A. scholaris extracts and alkaloids have shown antitussive, anti-asthmatic, expectorant (Shang et al., 2010a), analgesic, anti-inflammatory (Shang et al., 2010b), anti-airway inflammation (Zhao et al., 2016), and airways anti-allergic effect (Zhao et al., 2017) in vivo. The alkaloids also triggered \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) activation (Hou et al., 2012a) and inhibited the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) (Hou et al., 2012b) bioactivities in vitro. Based on the pre-clinical studies, the total indole alkaloids from A. scholaris (TA) has been registered as investigational new botanical drug (No. 2011L01436) and was approved for phase I/II clinical trials by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). A phase-I Single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial has been completed, and the results support further phase-II clinical trials. The traditional use and our pharmacological evaluation assumed that the alkaloids from the leaf of A. scholaris might be used in treatment of respiratory diseases related to airway sub-acute inflammation. In this paper, we present the effect of alkaloids on the model of post-infectious cough.",

SOD is an enzyme that exists in cells for removing oxyradicals, whose activity variation may represent the degree of tissue injury. Extracellular SOD might modulate neutrophil inflammation by reducing cytokine, released from macrophages, suggesting that extracellular SOD is an anti-inflammatory enzyme as well as a major anti-oxidant (Mates, 2000).

However, the inhibition effect of TA was not appeared in a dosage dependent manner and superior to single alkaloids, simultaneously, four major alkaloids had different effects on different indicators, which assumed that the synergic effect between each component may compensate the drawback of single compound on PIC. And more importantly, this effect might be associated with the reduction of inflammatory infiltration and the improvement between oxidation and anti-oxidation.",
