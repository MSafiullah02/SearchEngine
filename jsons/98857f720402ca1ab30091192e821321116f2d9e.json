The average sequence homology of evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs is only 20% between human and mouse and drops to 5% between human and fish 7 . Thus, primary structure does not provide relevant information on lncRNA conservation and secondary structure should be used for better characterization. In addition to lncRNAs, the transcriptomes of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses retain their fold even if sequences mutate rapidly 9 , which indicates that secondary structure investigation can reveal important properties.",

The open begin and end (OBE-DTW) algorithm was employed to compare profiles of different lengths. Indeed, the DTW method imposes the same begins and ends to the two profiles that are compared, while OBE-DTW searches the profile of shorter length within the other one.",
