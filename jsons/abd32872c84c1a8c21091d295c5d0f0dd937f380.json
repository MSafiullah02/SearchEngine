The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, perhaps the most devastating infectious disease pandemic in recorded history, resulted in an estimated 40 million deaths worldwide, including 700,000 deaths in the US. 4 The global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2003, although considerably smaller in scale, resulted in 8098 cases and 774 deaths S and is a dramatic contemporary example of the ability of viral pneumonias to rapidly disseminate and cause severe disease in human populations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 740, "end": 741, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although viruses are commonly identified causes of pneumonia of infants and young children, they are relatively infrequently recognized as agents of communityacquired pneumonia in adults. 6 In several large series that investigated a microbiologic cause of community-acquired pneumonia, viral etiologies were identified in only 9% to 18% of cases (Table 11 .1).7-12 However, it is likely that viral pneumonias are underrecognized and underdiagnosed for various reasons. Although some agents may cause distinct cytopathology or inclusions (e.g., adenoviruses, herpesviruses, and paramyxoviruses), many important pathogens (e.g., influenza viruses) do not, and none of these agents are resolved specifically in tissue by routine histologic stains. Viruses require live cells for cultivation, and are generally more difficult than bacteria to isolate from clinical samples.

Certain viruses cause the death of ciliated respiratory epithelium and thereby disrupt normal ciliary activity. Viruses may also inhibit the phagocytic or bactericidal activities of neutrophils, T lymphocytes, and alveolar macrophages, and predispose the host to secondary infections. Certain gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria adhere to and colonize virus-infected epithelium more readily than to noninfected cells by various hypothetical mechanisms, including alteration and induction of receptors at the host-cell surface and changes in the extracellular environmentY-19 Finally, viral infections of the lung may exacerbate noninfectious pulmonary conditions (e.g., asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and indirectly contribute to aggregate morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions. 20 Although influenza viruses remain the most frequently identified cause of viral pneumonia in adults (Table 11 .1), the diversity of agents identified as causes of viral pneumonias has expanded considerably. Several newly recognized viral pneumonias have been identified since 1992 that are among the most feared and lethal of all emerging infections, including those caused by hantaviruses, Nipah virus, and SARS corona virus (Co V). !3,21-23 Certain causes \"Rubella (2), rhinovirus (1) , mixed viral infections (3) .

For other agents, such as measles, Nipah virus, and herpesviruses, typically the lungs are involved as part of a multisystem syndrome. The diagnosis of viral pneumonia, suspected by patient history and clinical manifestations, also can be supported histopathologically, and the general pattern of histopathologic lesions may suggest a specific diagnosis. Many viruses can be identified in lung by examining the tissue response and cytopathic changes. Some of these viruses cause recognizable tissue reaction patterns including necrotizing tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and interstitial pneumonia.

Adenoviruses are protein-shelled icosahedral-shaped nonenveloped viruses that measure approximately 70 to 90nm in diameter. Two of the viruses are stain penetrated revealing the DNA-containing nucleoprotein. B. Sin Nombre virus. Sin Nombre virus, the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, belongs to the genus hantavirus in the family Bunyaviridae. The envelopes of hantaviruses are checkerboard in appearance, and particles measure 90 to 150nm in diameter. C. Herpes simplex virus. The stain has penetrated the envelope of several of these herpesvirus particles, delineating the icosahedral-shaped nucleocapsids, which measure 90 to 100nm in diameter. D. Cytomegalovirus. Another herpesvirus; one virus particle (left) is intact while two nearby particles are stainpenetrated and show the viral nucleocapsids. The nucleocapsid of the upper right particle shows a central core that harbors the DNA of the virus. E. Influenza virus.

Cell culture techniques, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and electron microscopy (EM) all play vital roles in the diagnosis of these infections. While histologic techniques can be an excellent means of demonstrating organisms, tissue culture isolation remains essential for definitive identification of the virus. When a viral pneumonia is suspected, samples of lung tissues should be evaluated by cell culture, which has the advantage of being a nonbiased method for screening purposes that does not rely on the availability of specific antibodies or probes. Electron microscopy offers the same utility as a broad scope diagnostic tool and has been especially critical in outbreaks of unknown etiology. It played a critical role during the Hendra and Nipah virus outbreaks in 1994 and 1999, respectively, and more recently, in the early recognition of a novel coronavirus associated with SARS in 2003 and in the diagnosis of emerging transplant-associated infections. 13.22.29-33 The advantage of this approach is that viral particles may be demonstrated by negative stain or thin section EM, either directly in clinical material or after amplification in cell culture. Like culture, EM is not limited by narrow specificity of reagents or by prior clinical bias ( Fig. 11 .1). and can be filamentous or spherical in shape. The evenly spaced spikes cover the entire virus surface and contain both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface glycoproteins. F. Human metapneumovirus. These paramyxoviruses are heterogeneous in size and shape, and range in size from 150nm to 1 J.lm in diameter. G. Parainfluenza virus. Another paramyxovirus, the viral nucleocapsid, with its typical herringbone appearance, can be seen both within the stain-penetrated particle as well as partially extruded from the virion. An important feature that can help distinguish between Paramyxovirinae (parainfluenza and measles viruses) and Pneumovirinae (human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus) is the diameter of the nucleocapsids, which measure 18nm and 14nm, respectively.

The initial adenovirus isolate was made serendipitously from adenoid tissues obtained from children during efforts to establish a primary human adenoid cell line. 34 A related virus was identified the following year by investigators studying respiratory disease in military recruits?5 These agents were subsequently named adenoviruses after the original source of tissue from which the prototype strain was identified. 36 Adenoviruses are non enveloped viruses with a single, linear, double-stranded DNA genome that is contained within an icosahedral capsid that measures 70 to 90nm in diameter (Fig. ILIA) . The capsid is comprised of seven known polypeptides, including the hexon capsomere, which contains group-specific antigenic determinants. 37 Adenoviruses are a ubiquitous and diverse group of viruses found naturally in the upper respiratory tracts and gastrointestinal systems of humans, other mammals, and birds. Most adenoviruses infect mucosal epithelium, although some pathogens of animals are trophic for endothelial cells, and endothelial infection has been identified in some immunocompromised humans. 38 Adenoviruses are represented by at least 51 serotypes on the basis of resistance to neutralization by antisera to other known adenovirus serotypes, and comprise six subgroups or subgenera (A through F) that are distinguished by differential hemagglutination with erythrocytes from various animal species. 37 ,39Ao More than 50% of the known adenovirus serotypes are associated with human diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract, conjunctiva, urinary tract, intestine, and occasionally heart, liver, and central nervous system. The others are rarely encountered and mayor may not act as pathogens in recognizable disease. 37 It is estimated that approximately 5% to 10% of all pneumonias in infants and young children are caused by adenoviruses. 41 ,42 Most pediatric cases of adenovirus pneumonia occur between 6 months and 5 years of age, and serotypes 3, 7, and 21 (all members of the B subgenus), are the most common causes of pneumonia in this patient cohort. 43 -45 Serotypes 3 and 7 are particularly pathogenic adenoviruses that can cause disseminated and often fatal disease in previously healthy children. 46 In adults, pneumonia is generally associated with serotypes 3,4, and 7.47 Periodic epidemics of adenovirus pneumonia in young adults have been identified, particularly among military recruits. 48 ,49 In a manner similar to other pathogens, adenoviruses take advantage of impaired or destroyed immune systems to establish persistent and disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts. In this patient cohort, the S.R. Zaki and CD. Paddock case fatality rate of adenoviral pneumonia approaches 60%, compared with an approximately 15% mortality in immunocompetent patients. 37 Immunocompromised patients are also susceptible to a broader range of different adenovirus serotypes. By example, the commonly recognized serotypes in normal children account for only about 50% of the adenovirus serotypes reported for children with congenital immune deficiencies. 37 .4 6 Because some adenoviruses establish latency in lymphoid tissues and the kidneys of their host, it is believed that many, possibly most, cases of clinical disease caused by adenoviruses in immunocompromised patients are reactivated infections. 37 The lungs of patients with adenovirus pneumonia are typically heavy and edematous, and the bronchi are generally filled with mucoid, fibrinous, or purulent exudates. The histopathologic findings ( Fig. 11 .2) include necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis with extensive denudation ofthe surface epithelium,particularly in medium-sized (1 to 2mm in diameter) intrapulmonary bronchi ( Fig.  11 .2A). Affected airways may be occluded by homogeneous eosinophilic material, mixed inflammatory cells, detached epithelium, and cellular debris. The lamina propria of bronchi and bronchioles is typically congested and infiltrated by predominantly mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates. Bronchial serous and mucous glands are also often involved and show necrosis and mixed infiltrates. 5o As the infection progresses, there is involvement of the pulmonary parenchyma, forming bronchocentric necrosis with hemorrhage, neutrophilic and mononuclear cell infiltrates, and karyorrhexis. These findings generally occur against a background of exudative diffuse alveolar damage, with filling of the air space by macrophages, fibrin, and detached pneumocytes, and hyaline membrane formation. 51 Patients with fatal pneumonia may develop disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and demonstrate fibrin thrombi in vessels of the lungs, kidney, heart, adrenals, and central nervous system (see Fig. 4 .20 in Chapter 4). 48 Adenoviruses form intranuclear inclusions in respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, in the acinar cells of bronchial glands, and in alveolar pneumocytes, and are generally most abundant at the viable edges of necrotic foci. By using the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain, early inclusions appear as small, dense, amphophilic structures surrounded by a cleared zone and peripherally marginated chromatin, similar to herpetic inclusions. As the cellular infection progresses, the inclusion becomes larger (as large as 14/-lm in some cells) and more basophilic, and the margins of the nuclear membrane become blurred to form the characteristic \"smudge cell\" (Fig. 11 .2B,C).5o,51 Tracheal aspirates of patients with adenovirus pneumonia may show distinctive features on cytologic preparations that include cells with fine strands of chromatin that radiate from a central inclusion to the marginated chromatin at the nuclear membrane (\"rosette cells\"), and cells with foamy, \"honeycomb\" nuclei, as well as typical smudge cells (see Fig.  7 .45 in Chapter 7). 52 Various methods can be used to diagnose adenovirus infections that include antigen detection, cell culture, electron microscopy, molecular assays, and serology. Direct detection techniques that identify the common group-reactive hexon antigen in tissues or body fluids include fluorescence antibody assays and enzyme immunoassays.53 Immunohistochemistry staining methods have been used successfully to detect adenovirus-infected cells in formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissues using various commercially available, adenovirus group-specific antibodies ( Fig.11 .2E,F).38,51 Electron microscopy of adenovirus-infected tissues reveals a paracrystalline array of virions ( Fig. 11 .2D ). 54, 55 Most adenoviruses can be isolated in cell culture from bronchial washings, tracheal aspirates, or lung biopsy specimens during the early stage of the illness and grow well in various cell lines, including human embryonic kidney, HeLa, and HEp-2 cells. 47 Cell cultures infected with adenoviruses exhibit a relatively characteristic cytopathologic effect, described as a \"cluster of grapes,\" within 3 to 5 days after inoculation. Serotyping of the isolate is accomplished by using hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization tests with hyperimmune type-specific animal antisera. 56 Molecular assays, particularly gene amplification using PCR, and ISH methods, have been developed to detect adenovirus nucleic acid in respiratory secretions and in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. 51 ,57,58 Broad-range, sensitive assays that can detect any adenovirus amplify common genomic sequences (e.g., the hexon gene region). Other more specific assays detect specific adenovirus types with unique genomic sequences. 59 Serologic assays include tests for groupspecific antibodies (e,g., complement fixation and enzyme immunoassays), or type-specific antibodies (e.g., neutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition assays). Pitfalls associated with serologic testing for adenoviruses include occasional rises in heterotypic antibodies when typespecific assays are used, and relatively low sensitivity demonstrated by complement fixation assays. 59", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 573, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 899, "end": 901, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1906, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2593, "end": 2599, "text": "48 ,49", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3265, "end": 3266, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3510, "end": 3512, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4920, "end": 4922, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 6010, "end": 6012, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 6700, "end": 6703, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 6704, "end": 6706, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 747, "end": 758, "text": "(Fig. ILIA)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3710, "end": 3717, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 3899, "end": 3907, "text": "Fig.  11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 4894, "end": 4900, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5610, "end": 5618, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 5983, "end": 5990, "text": "Fig.  7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6569, "end": 6575, "text": "Fig.11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 6685, "end": 6692, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Adenoviruses"}, {"text": "Human hantaviral diseases are caused by a group of closely related, trisegmented, negative-sense RNA viruses of the genus Hantavirus, of the family Bunyaviridae. 60 -62 Members of the genus Hantavirus have similar morphologic features. 63 ,64 Virus particles are 70 to 130nm in diameter and generally appear spherical to ovoid, although pleomorphic forms may be seen.

The presence of characteristic inclusion bodies in thin section electron microscopy and a unique grid-like pattern on negative-stain electron microscopy differentiate these viruses from other members of the family Bunyaviridae ( Fig. 11.1B) . 65, 66 The severity and disease type largely depends on the viral serotype. Two categories of hantavirus-associated illnesses are described: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) for disease in which the kidneys are primarily involved, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) for disease in which the lungs are primarily involved. 67 -69 The isolation of the first recognized hantavirus (Hantaan virus, named for the river in South Korea), and its subsequent identification as the causative agent of HFRS was reported in 1978. 70 In 1993, the deaths of several previously healthy individuals due to a rapidly progressive respiratory disease in the southwestern United States were etiologically linked to a previously unrecognized hantavirus. Clinically, the disease differs from HFRS in its pronounced pulmonary involvement and higher mortality rates and is known as HPS. 23.69,71.72 Hantavirus-associated diseases primarily affect blood vessels and result in different degrees of generalized capillary dilatation and edema. 73 In contrast to severe HFRS where abundant protein-rich, gelatinous retroperitoneal edema fluid is found, all HPS patients have large bilateral pleural effusions and heavy edematous lungs. 7 In fatal Far Eastern HFRS, a distinctive triad of hemorrhagic necrosis can be seen in the renal medullary junctional zone, cardiac right atrium, and anterior pituitary. 75, 78 However, in patients with HPS, hemorrhages are rare, and ischemic necrotic lesions, except those attributed to shock, are not seen. 72, 74 Histologically, morphologic changes of the endothelium are uncommon but, when seen, consist of prominent and swollen endothelial cells. Vascular thrombi and endothelial cell necrosis are rare. In HFRS, the most severe and characteristic microscopic lesions involve the kidney; however, an interstitial pneumonitis can also be seen in some fatal cases. In contrast, the microscopic changes of North and South American HPS are principally seen in the lung and spleen. 72 ,74 The lungs show a mild to moderate interstitial pneumonitis characterized by variable degrees of edema and an interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate comprised of a mixture of small and enlarged mononuclear cells with the appearance of immunoblasts ( Fig.11 .3A). Focal hyaline membranes composed of condensed proteinaceous intraalveolar edema fluid, fibrin, and variable numbers of inflammatory cells are observed ( Fig. 11 .3B). Typically, neutrophils are scanty and the alveolar pneumocytes are intact with no evidence of cellular debris, nuclear fragmentation, or hyperplasia. In fatal cases, with a prolonged survival interval, tissues show features more characteristic of the exudative and proliferative stages of diffuse alveolar damage. Lung biopsies taken from patients who survive their illness appear similar with proliferated reparative type II pneumocytes, severe edematous and fibroblastic thickening of the alveolar septa, and severe air-space disorganization with distorted lung architecture (see Chapter 4) . Other characteristic microscopic findings in HPS cases include variable numbers of immunoblasts within the splenic red pulp and periarteriolar white pulp, lymph nodal paracortical zones, hepatic portal triads, and peripheral blood ( Fig. 11.3D,E) . Similarly, in severe HFRS cases, large mononuclear cells can be present in the spleen, lymph nodes, blood, and hepatic portal triads. 75 . 76 Electron microscopic studies of HPS lung tissue demonstrate infection of endothelial cells and macrophages. 69 . 72 The virus or virus-like particles observed are infrequent and extremely difficult to identify in autopsy tissues because of the considerable degree of viral pleomorphism and the postmortem deterioration of tissues. However, typical hantaviral inclusions are seen more frequently and their identity can be confirmed by immunolabeling ( Fig. 11 .3F,G). Similar inclusions are observed in epithelial cells in HFRS and are considered to be ultrastructural markers of hantavirus-infected cells. 63 .79.8o Using immunohistochemistry, viral antigens are found primarily within capillary endothelium throughout various tissues in both HPS and HFRS. In HPS, marked accumulations of hantaviral antigens are in the pulmonary microvasculature and in splenic and lymph nodal follicular dendritic cells (Fig. 11 .3C).72 Despite the extensive endothelial cell accumulations of hantaviral antigens, there is little ultrastructural evidence of cytopathic effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 845, "end": 848, "text": "65,", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 849, "end": 851, "text": "66", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1381, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1724, "end": 1735, "text": "23.69,71.72", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1879, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2242, "text": "75,", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2245, "text": "78", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2381, "text": "72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2382, "end": 2384, "text": "74", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 3871, "end": 3881, "text": "Chapter 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4267, "end": 4269, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 4272, "end": 4274, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 4881, "end": 4890, "text": "63 .79.8o", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 831, "end": 842, "text": "Fig. 11.1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 3109, "end": 3115, "text": "Fig.11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 3275, "end": 3282, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 4117, "end": 4130, "text": "Fig. 11.3D,E)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 4726, "end": 4733, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 5180, "end": 5188, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Ranta viruses"}, {"text": "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome should be suspected in cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) without a known precipitating cause among previously healthy individuals.

These cytopathic changes, identified by early pathologists in the salivary glands of children dying from various unrelated diseases,111-113 led to the early designation of cytomegalic inclusion disease many years before the causative agent was isolated in the mid-1950s. The name cytomegalovirus was proposed in 1960 to reflect the cytopathic changes caused by these viruses. 114 Cytomegaloviruses are highly host-specific, and various mammalian hosts, including nonhuman primates, rodents, and domesticated animals, are infected with their own distinct CMY. In this context, human CMV is stringently species-specific and, with rare exception, only infects cells of human origin. ll5 Several cell types are permissive for CMV replication, including alveolar pneumocytes, vascular endothelium, fibroblasts, monocytes, dendritic cells, and exocrine and endocrine glandular epithelial cells.ll6 Cytomegalovirus is a ~-herpesvirus with the largest genome (230 kilobase pair [kbp]) of all the herpesviruses known to infect humans. The double-stranded linear DNA genome is contained within a 90 to 100nm icosahedral capsid and is surrounded by an amorphous material known as the tegument. These components are enclosed in a lipid bilayer envelope that is derived from the host cell nuclear or Golgi membranes and contains several vir ally encoded glycoproteins necessary for infection of other cells. Mature enveloped virions range from 150 to 200nm, making CMV one of the largest viruses that infect humans (Fig. I1.1D ).ll7 The structure of CMV is typical of other human herpesviruses, but demonstrates some subtle ultrastructural differences from other viruses in this group including greater pleomorphism of the lipid envelope and dense body inclusions in the cytoplasm of infected cells.ll8 437 Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous human pathogen, and in North America infects approximately 50% to 90% of the population.ll7 Most of these infections are inapparent, although some cases of primary infection in otherwise healthy individuals result in a self-limited mononucleosis syndrome similar to that caused by Epstein-Barr virus; it is estimated that 20% to 50% of cases of heterophile-negative mononucleosis, and 8% of all cases of mononucleosis, are caused by CMy' 119 Pulmonary involvement in CMV mononucleosis is infrequent and occurs in approximately 6% of these casesYo Congenitally acquired CMV infection has various deleterious effects on the fetus, including mental retardation, neurologic abnormalities, sensorineural hearing loss, and retinitis, and in one series pulmonary involvement occurred in 64 % of symptomatic infants. 121 Like all herpesviruses, CMV remains with its host for life after primary infection and establishes latency in various cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, monocytes and macrophages, neutrophils, and renal and pulmonary epithelial cells. 122 Activation of viral replication occurs in persons with severely compromised immunity. Patients with advanced HIV disease and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell or lung transplants are particularly at risk of developing CMV pneumonia. Before the use of CMV screening and effective antiviral prophylaxis regimens, 10% to 30% of all patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for leukemia, and 15% to 55% of solid organ transplants, developed CMV pneumonia with case fatality rates of greater than 80% in some series. 26 ,123,124 The relatively high frequency of CMV pneumonia in lung transplant recipients may be a correlate of animal model data that indicate the lungs are a major site of latent CMV infection. 125 Before the use of ganciclovir as therapy for CMV disease in AIDS patients, the case fatality rate for CMV pneumonia in this patient cohort was 75% when CMV was the only pathogen identified. Mixed infections with CMV and another pathogen had an even worse prognosis, and the case fatality rate for patients with pulmonary disease caused by CMV and Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly carinii) was 92%. 126 Cytomegalovirus pneumonia can show various histopathologic patterns (Fig. 11 .5). Extensive intra alveolar hemorrhage with scattered cytomegalic cells and relatively few inflammatory cell infiltrates may occur ( Fig.  11 .5A).127 In a similar manner, extensive involvement of the alveolar epithelium with minimal inflammation or overt evidence of parenchymal injury has also been described. 128 Other patterns include multifocal lesions with mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates, hemorrhage, necrosis, and cytomegalic cells, or a diffuse, predominantly mononuclear cell infiltrate, interstitial pneumonitis with intraalveolar edema and fibrin deposition, and diffusely distributed cytomegalic cells (Fig. 11 .5E).129-131 The cytomegalic changes of CMV-infected cells are evident by standard H&E staining and are virtually pathognomonic of active CMV infection. The cells are enlarged (25 to 40!J,m) and contain amphophilic to deeply basophilic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions ( Fig. 11 .5B,E). The single intranuclear inclusion is composed of viral nucleoprotein and assembled caps ids, and is a large (up to 20 !J,m), round to ovoid body with a smoothly contoured border that is generally surrounded by a clear halo that gives the inclusion a distinctive owl'seye appearance. The host cell nucleolus is often retained in the inclusion. 131 Cytoplasmic inclusions are small (1 to 3!J,m), granular bodies that appear after the intranuclear inclusion is well developed and are not uniformly present in all CMV-infected cells (Fig. 11 .5B). These inclusions represent a mixture of virions and various cellular organelles, and increase in size and number as the infection progresses. 132 Unlike the intranuclear inclusion, the cytoplasmic inclusions stain with periodic acid-Schiff stain and are deeply argyrophilic with Gomori's methenamine silver stain.!33", "cite_spans": [{"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "114", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2047, "text": "437", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2892, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 3681, "end": 3692, "text": "26 ,123,124", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3879, "text": "125", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 4277, "end": 4280, "text": "126", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 4672, "end": 4675, "text": "128", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1756, "end": 1767, "text": "(Fig. I1.1D", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4349, "end": 4357, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 4493, "end": 4501, "text": "Fig.  11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 4979, "end": 4987, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 5271, "end": 5278, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 5816, "end": 5824, "text": "(Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Cytomegalovirus"}, {"text": "Cytomegalovirus pneumonia is defined by the presence of signs or symptoms of pulmonary disease combined with the detection of CMV in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung tissue samples.

By the end of the 19th century, investigators surmised that the herpetic lesions of the lips and genitalia were manifestations of a single infectious agent, and recognized that it was a disease distinct from herpes zoster. 136.137 As with all human herpesviruses, HSV is a large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA-containing virion with an icoshedral nucleocapsid approximately 100 to 1l0nm in diameter, composed of 162 cap somers. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by an amorphous, sometimes asymmetric material (the tegument) that is surrounded by a thin, trilaminar envelope that contains numerous glycoprotein spikes (Fig. 11.1C ). The assembly of HSV begins in the nucleus of its host cell and the virus acquires its envelope as the capsid buds through the inner lamella of the nuclear membrane.120.l38 Two serologic types are recognized and each is most frequently associated with particular disease syndromes; however, either serotype may cause any of the aggregate clinical syndromes. Herpes simplex virus-1 causes gingivostomatitis, pharyngitis, esophagitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and encephalitis, and is the serotype most commonly associated with adult HSV pneumonia. Herpes simplex virus-2 typically infects genital sites such as the penis, urethra, vulva, vagina, and cervix, and is the serotype associated with approximately 80% of disseminated disease and pulmonary infections in newborn infants. 136 All herpesviruses have the ability to persist in an inactive state for varying periods of time and then recur spontaneously following undefined stimuli associated with physical or emotional stress, trauma to nerve roots or ganglia, fever, immunosuppression, or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. 138 During the primary infection, HSV replicates at the portal of entry (typically oral or genital mucosae), and infects sensory nerve endings. The virus is transported centripetally along peripheral sensory nerves to central axons and finally to nerve cell bodies in the trigeminal, sacral, and vagal ganglia, where it replicates briefly before becoming latent.139-141 Antiviral drugs have no effect on latent infection with HSV. Following cues that initiate viral reactivation, HSV replicates in sensory ganglia and is transported centrifugally along sensory nerves to epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces. 138 Reactivation of HSV from the trigeminal ganglion is associated with asymptomatic excretion of virus in saliva, and with the development of herpetic ulcers on the vermillion border of the lip, oral mucosa, or external facial skin. 142 Newborn infants, severely immunosuppressed or burned patients, and patients with severe trauma are at greatest risk of developing HSV pneumonia.143-146 Lower respiratory tract disease in neonates is most commonly associated with disseminated herpetic infections. Disseminated HSV infection in the newborn was first described in 1935 as \"hepatoadrenal necrosis\"147 because of the prominent and frequent necroses that occur in the livers and adrenal glands of affected neonates. 148 Most cases of neonatal disease represent primary HSV infections and are acquired during parturition from HSVinfected mothers. The incidence of neonatal HSV infection is approximately 1 in 3200 deliveries, and disseminated disease develops in approximately 25% of infected neonates. 149 In disseminated infections, signs and symptoms appear a mean of 5 days after birth (range, 0 to 12 days), and approximately 40% to 50% of these patients develop pneumonia. In the pre antiviral era, 85 % of neonates with disseminated disease died from the infection. With early diagnosis and high-dose acyclovir therapy, mortality has been reduced to approximately 30%?6,138,149 The disease can be exceedingly difficult to diagnose in a timely manner as only 10% of mothers of affected infants have clinically apparent HSV infection at the time of delivery.15o Neonates that survive severe disseminated disease may develop hepatic and adrenal calcifications evident on abdominal radiographs. 151 In adults, infection of the respiratory tract with HSV may be associated with disseminated herpetic infection, but is more commonly identified as an isolated disease manifestation resulting from reactivation of latent herpetic infections in the oropharynx. Herpetic tracheobronchitis is an ulcerative process characterized by large areas of denuded mucosal epithelium and fibrinopurulent exudate containing necrotic cells with densely eosinophilic cytoplasm. Despite extensive tissue damage, cells with intranuclear inclusions may be sparse, and, when identified, are found most often at the margins of the ulcerated epithelium or occasionally in the mucous glands subjacent to ulcerated surfaces. ls2 Aspiration of viruscontaining secretions into the lower respiratory tract is believed to be the most frequent cause of pulmonary infection with HSV; however, oral lesions may be absent in patients with herpetic laryngotracheobronchitis and bronchopneumonia. 153 Disease can be also associated with airway trauma caused by tracheal intubation or from hematogenous dissemination of HSV. 144 ,1S2,1S4 Chest radiographs of HSV pneumonia generally show ill-defined nodular or reticular densities of various sizes scattered in both lung fields. During the early stages of disease, these nodules measure 2 to 5 mm and are best seen in the periphery of the lungs. As the disease progresses, these lesions coalesce and enlarge to form more extensive infiltrates. 137 Herpetic infections of the airways and lung are characteristically difficult to diagnose clinically and HSV pneumonia was not described as a distinct clinical entity until 1949.155 Several studies attest to the relative infrequency with which this diagnosis is considered in patients with respiratory disease. For example, none of the 15 cases of HSV disease of the middle and lower respiratory tract identified in a review of autopsies at Brooke Army Medical Center during 1965 to 1968 were suspected prior to autopsy. 143 In a 1982 review of 20 culture-confirmed cases of HSV pneumonia, none of the patients had been diagnosed prior to death and all 16 had oral herpetic lesions at the time of death.144 Recent investigations also suggest that lower respiratory tract disease caused by HSV may be more common than currently appreciated. In a study from Sweden, HSV was cultured from pro- A diagnosis of tracheobronchitis and pneumonia is best established histologically (Fig. 11.6 ). Because lower respiratory tract HSV infections are often focused in the tracheobronchial tree, open lung biopsy may be less sensitive than bronchoscopy.154 Herpetic lesions show extensive necrosis and karyorrhectic debris and are associated with hemorrhage and a sparse-to-moderate neutrophilic infiltrate (Fig. 11.6A,B) . Intranuclear inclusions are best appreciated in cells at the leading edge of necrotic foci ( Fig. 11 .6B,C). Inclusions appear either as homogeneous, amphophilic, and glassy (Cowdry type B inclusions), or as eosinophilic with a halo separating the inclusion from the nuclear membrane (i.e., Cow dry type A inclusions). 158 Cowdry type B inclusions contain actively replicating virus. Type A inclusions, considered noninfectious and devoid of viral nucleic acid or protein, represent the nuclear \"scar\" of HSV infection. 136 ,141 Other changes associated with HSV, including multi nucleation and nuclear molding, and ballooning degeneration of the cytoplasm, are more frequently associated with squamous epithelium and are seldom encountered in the lung. Because of the high frequency of hepatic and adrenal involvement with disseminated HSV infection in young children ( Fig. 11 .6F,G), liver biopsy has been suggested as a diagnostic technique in this patient cohort. 148 Commercially available antibodies exist for IHC detection of HSV in tissues (Fig. 11.6D ).ls9", "cite_spans": [{"start": 362, "end": 369, "text": "136.137", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1548, "text": "136", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 2688, "end": 2691, "text": "142", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 3455, "end": 3458, "text": "149", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 4150, "end": 4153, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 5610, "end": 5613, "text": "137", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 6134, "end": 6137, "text": "143", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 7242, "end": 7245, "text": "158", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 754, "end": 765, "text": "(Fig. 11.1C", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 6586, "end": 6596, "text": "(Fig. 11.6", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 6906, "end": 6920, "text": "(Fig. 11.6A,B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 7016, "end": 7023, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 7794, "end": 7801, "text": "Fig. 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 7972, "end": 7983, "text": "(Fig. 11.6D", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Herpes Simplex Viruses"}, {"text": "Virus isolation remains an important diagnostic method; however, because HSV can be isolated from oropharyngeal secretions and occasionally from the lower respiratory tract of patients who lack overt pulmonary disease, virologic cultures must be interpreted in the context of complementary clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings as much as possible.

It has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome with approximately 125 kbp that encodes more than 70 proteins. The icosahedral nucleocapsid is indistinguishable in appearance from other herpes viruses. The nucleocapsid and the tegument are surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope derived from the host cytoplasmic membranes. The enveloped viral particle is pleomorphic to spherical in shape and 180 to 200nm in diameter. 16o The primary infection is initiated by inoculation of respiratory mucosa by the virus through infectious aerosols or by direct contact of skin lesions of patients with varicella or herpes zoster. After a primary viremia in the reticuloendothelial system, and secondary viremia in circulating mononuclear cells, the virus is disseminated to the skin, where it initiates a vesicular rash, and back to mucosal sites in the lungs. The release of infectious virus into respiratory droplets is a pathogenic characteristic that distinguishes VZV from other human herpesviruses. The attack rate for previously uninfected household contacts exposed to varicella is approximately 90%. For less sustained exposure, it is estimated to be approximately 10% to 30%. 160 During primary infection with VZV, viral replication in keratinocytes (Fig. 11.7 A) and vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells of the superficial dermis produces the generalized, pruritic, vesicular rash of varicella commonly known as chickenpox. Varicella-zoster virus also establishes latent infection within satellite cells and neurons of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate under various conditions to cause herpes zoster, a painful vesicular rash commonly referred to as shingles. 161 The origin of the term chickenpox is speCUlative, but believed to derive from gican, an Old English term for itching. The term shingles originates from the medieval Latin cinguls, or girdle, and alludes to the partial encircling of the trunk by the rash of herpes zoster. 137 ,160 Varicella-zoster virus is ubiquitous in human populations around the world, and humans are the only known host.

Chickenpox is considered a relatively benign infection in children, but adult patients are approximately 25 times more likely than children to develop pneumonia. The greatest risk of severe disease and pneumonia occurs in those patients with chronic lung disease, immunesuppressing conditions, neonates, and pregnant women. 163 Varicella-zoster virus-related deaths have declined sharply in the U.S. since universal childhood vaccination was implemented in 1995. 24 ,25 S.R.

Inflammatory cell infiltrates and necrotic areas are usually mild and, when present, consist of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. Commonly observed histopathologic changes in the lung include various degrees of hemorrhage, intra alveolar edema, interstitial pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage (Figs. 11.17 A, 11.18A, 11.19A, 11.20A, and 11.21A). Several references containing detailed pathologic descriptions in human cases are recommended. 29.72.333-35o .' A. Pulmonary hemorrhage and diffuse alveolar damage in a patient who was infected through organ transplantation. Note that, unlike this case, which occurred due to immunosuppression, LCMV infections are rarely fatal and usually resolve with no specific treatment. B. Abundant LCMV antigens in areas of The diagnosis of VHF should be suspected in patients with appropriate clinical manifestations returning from an endemic area, particularly if there is travel to rural areas during seasonal or epidemic disease activity. The diagnosis suspected by history and clinical manifestations can also be supported histopathologically, and the overall pattern of histopathologic lesions may suggest a specific diagnosis. However, because of similar pathologic features seen in VHF and a variety of other viral, rickettsial, and bacterial infections, unequivocal diagnosis can only be made by S.R. Zaki and CD. Paddock lung showing diffuse alveolar damage. C. Using immunohistochemistry, abundant LCMV antigens are seen within cytoplasm of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells in association with areas of hepatocellular necrosis.
