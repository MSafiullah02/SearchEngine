Release of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), results in fever. Chemokines, such as IL-8 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, stimulate bone marrow release of neutrophils and homing to the lung, producing both peripheral leukocytosis and increased purulent secretions. Erythrocytes crossing the alveolar\u2013capillary membrane in the stage of red hepatization result in hemoptysis. Inflammatory mediators released by macrophages and the newly recruited neutrophils cause an alveolar capillary leak equivalent to that demonstrated for ARDS, although initially localized in pneumonia. Radiographic infiltrates and rales detectable on auscultation are a direct result of the alveolar\u2013capillary leak syndrome. Hypoxemia results from alveolar filling but may be exacerbated by paralysis of the hypoxemic vasoconstriction that would normally occur with fluid-filled alveoli by some bacterial pathogens. Increased respiratory drive as part of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome leads to respiratory alkalosis. Decreased compliance due to capillary leak, hypoxemia, increased respiratory drive, increased secretions and occasionally infection-related bronchospasm all lead to dyspnea and, if severe enough, respiratory failure.",

However, PCT may be low in atypical pathogen CAP as well and is clearly elevated in severe viral CAP, such as seen in the 2009\u20132010 influenza A pandemic, with or without evidence of superimposed bacterial pneumonia. C-reactive protein (CRP) is more nonspecific than PCT in CAP but may be a better predictor of treatment failure.14\n",

Both scores are valid for analysis of groups of CAP admissions, but admission of low score patients is legitimate, for both objective reasons (e.g. low arterial saturations) and subjective (e.g. unreliable home support, concern regarding compliance).",
