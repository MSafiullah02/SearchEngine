Additionally, the spreading of pollutants around and inside such buildings is more complex as a result of strong wind\u2013structure interactions and diverse spreading scenarios. Pollutants may be emitted from an HRR building (e.g. from a kitchen exhaust) and spread to the same building at different positions [13,14], like the possible SARS spreading in typical HRR buildings in Hong Kong [15], [16], [17]. Pollutants may also be released from sources located around a HRR building at lower levels [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], such as the evaporative facilities (e.g. cooling tower or air scrubber) of public facilities, which have been responsible for reported disease outbreaks [23], [24], [25]. Accordingly, the position of the potential pollutant source is an important factor in evaluating the risk of the spreading of pollutants near an HRR building, but it has not been fully evaluated in terms of the distance and the position angle between the source and the building.",

Wind tunnel is a valuable tool in studying such pollutant dispersion under controllable wind flow and weather conditions [14,[26], [27], [28]. However, detailed information, such as the flow field, is difficult to obtain from wind tunnel experiments, even with the most advanced techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) [29]. Therefore, numerical models based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been increasingly used to assist physical experimental studies. Such CFD models need to be carefully calibrated for specific problems, especially when considering the turbulence model and boundary conditions [30]. With the increasing of CFD studies in recent years, several efforts have been made to establish standard procedures for the accurate CFD simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in wind tunnels [31], [32], [33]. The choice of turbulence model in a CFD model normally needs to consider the balance between prediction accuracy and computational effort, which could be different for different problems investigated. It has been shown that Reynolds-Averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) models are capable of predicting accurate pollutant dispersions in 2D and 3D urban models [34], [35], [36].",

However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have been conducted on the effect of the pollutant source location on the spreading of pollutants to a nearby high-rise building. This paper contributes to filling this gap using a numerical model. The model was validated by good agreement with the measured data in a wind tunnel experiment on the pollutant dispersion around a high-rise building [28]. Then the model was used to investigate the spreading of pollutants from a wide range of emission locations around a building. From the numerical simulations, the pollutant concentrations on different faces and levels of the building were quantified and analyzed in connection with the wind flow field. The correlation between the pollutant concentration and the pollutant source location was studied. Based on that, a mathematical model was established, which can help assess the risk of pollutant dispersion from different regions around a building in an overall picture.

Re-entry is a cul-de-sac design in order to accommodate a window/opening for all rooms to comply with the Hong Kong building code. Pollutant emission from an exhaust on the building was studied in a series of wind tunnel experiments [28]. The Reynolds number based on the building's height (ReUHH/\u03bd) exceeds the suggested value of 15,000 to ensure that the measurements were independent of Re and the reduced-scale model can be reliably used [42]. The dimensions of the building model and wind properties were extracted from the boundary layer wind tunnel test and used for the validation of the numerical model. Additionally, a generic rectangular-shaped building was also modelled, which has the same outer profile as the cruciform-shaped building with the ratio between the height H, breadth B and depth D given by H:B:D = 1:0.98:1.04, as shown in Fig. 1\n. Note the cruciform-shaped building model was used mainly for the validation of the numerical model as it was used in the wind tunnel experiment. The flow domain considered in the numerical model is illustrated in Fig. 2\n. Although some guidelines recommend the maximum blockage ratio for wind tunnel modelling can be as high as 10% [32], a blockage ratio smaller than 3% is normally recommended for modelling the hypothetic open terrain [43] to prevent an artificial acceleration of the flow around the building, and there are recommendations for the blockage ratios at different faces [32,33]. Based on these acknowledged guidelines a cross-section with height of 6H and width of 11H was chosen for the computational domain as a hypothetical open terrain. Distances of 5H and 15H were assumed for the inlet and outlet from the building, respectively.",

The smallest cell dimension was 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm \u00d7 4 mm in the three directions in the vicinity of the pollutant sources. The expansion ratio of 1.05 to 1.2 was used according to the need of each region, as recommended by guidelines that the expansion ratio should not be greater than 1.2 [32]. The fluid domain was divided into three regions as shown in Fig. 2. The first region, a cylindrical core around the building, aims to provide better resolution in the region near to the building. The second region, created in a doughnut shape, aims to cover the allocated locations for the pollutant source. This region was designed to avoid regenerating a new grid for any different position angles between the source and building. The third region was the rest of the domain. With the division into the different domains, the second part rotated every 15\u00b0 from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 counterclockwise to simulate the new pollutant source location.",

Traditionally, this is fulfilled by using the vertical wind profile measured in the empty wind tunnel as the inlet boundary condition and comparing it to the simulated incident profile at the target location in the empty numerical domain, and the two profiles should be in good agreement with each other. However, it could be more complicated with the presence of building(s). Therefore, a remedy is recommended to improve the turbulence model utilizing specified source terms in the transport equations of k or \u03b5\n[56,57] and implement Non-Linear Eddy Viscosity models (NLEV) for the disturbed flow within the Building Influence Area (BIA) [58].

Wind tunnel parameters and details of conducted experiments can be found in the reference [28]. The numerical model, with the mentioned boundary conditions in the previous section, generated a turbulent boundary layer flow. Using the wind velocity (3.27 m/s) at the building height (1 m), the friction velocity, u\n* \u2248 0.188 m/s, was obtained from Eq. (1) and applied to give the turbulent dissipation rate at the inlet boundary condition. The measured wind profiles (wind velocity and turbulent intensity) at the position of the building in the empty wind tunnel experiments were used as the inlet boundary condition in the numerical model. The atmospheric boundary layer should be horizontally homogenous both upstream and downstream of the domain [31], which means that the flow characteristics in different sections along the wind stream should agree with each other. This is a critical part of establishing a valid computational model and it was achieved through calibrating the wall functions and the boundary layer mesh together. The standard k\u2212\u03b5 model was improved by using User Defined Functions (UDF) in FLUENT to adjust the wall function parameters (kS and z\n0) simultaneously and employing the improved turbulence model within and outside of the BIA, a set of parameters was finally determined to satisfy the agreement between the simulated wind profile and experimental data, in terms of both velocity and turbulent intensity. In Fig. 3 the experimental wind profiles utilized at the domain's inlet (x = \u22125H) as boundary condition are compared with the simulated ones in the downstream part of the domain (x = 14H) near the outlet of the numerical domain for both cubic and cruciform shaped buildings. It can be seen that the improved k\u2013\u03b5 model predicted much better results than the standard k\u2013\u03b5 in order to replicate homogenous ABL flow along the wind stream.",

In particular, the features of the migrating pollutants resulting from the wind flow were captured. For example, in Fig. 5\n(a), the simulated flow shows a stagnation point on the 6th floor of the building's windward face in the re-entry. Thus, Fig. 4(a-1) shows that KC was higher in the first three floors when the emission point was located below the stagnation point on the 3rd level in the re-entry, and the pollutant pathway was mainly downward. However, when the source was on the 6th floor, KC decreased with the vertical distance from the source and increased in both the upward and downward directions, as shown in Fig. 4(a-2). This was due to the downwash and upwash effects happening near the releasing point pushing the pollutant vertically in both directions. If the pollutant was emitted from the 9th floor, following the flow streamlines it would mainly travel upwards, affecting the higher levels and passing over the top of the building. As a result, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a-3), the concentrations on the 9th and 10th floors were high, while those on the lower levels were almost negligible.",

With the increase of r, the maximum KC at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 decreased. For the side face, as shown in Fig 6(b), KC had two peaks at a \u03b8 \u2248 0\u00b0 and \u03b8 \u2248 180\u00b0, whereas the location of the first peak moved to a higher value and that of the second to a lower value with the decrease of r. On the other hand, KC was very small between two critical angles [\u03b81, \u03b82], while the values of \u03b81 and \u03b82 were dependent on r. As depicted in Fig 6(c), KC on the leeward face also had two peaks near \u03b8 \u2248 0\u00b0 and \u03b8 \u2248 180\u00b0, respectively. However, the first peak was rather low while the second peak very high. Also, similar to the side face, there was a range of angle between two critical values [\u03b81, \u03b82], in which KC was very small. The critical angles were different from those for the side face, and they were also dependent on r. Generally, Kc on the leeward face was much higher than on other faces when \u03b8 was close to 180\u00b0.",

In other words, if the pollutant outbreaks in such a region, KC on all faces of the building will always be very small; whereas if the outbreak occurs out of this region, the building will be significantly attacked on at least one of its faces.

If the pollutant spreads out from the first region (\u03b8\u2208 [0\u00b0, \u03b81]), it will mainly affect the windward face of the building as the air mainly flows to the windward face. However, since the air will flow over the side face with the separation reattachment, a certain amount of the pollutant may be carried to and deposit on the side face. The remainder of the pollutant not depositing on either the windward or the side face is carried to the lee of the building and may be dragged to the leeward face due to the recirculation flow there. The amount of the pollutant to be carried to the side and leeward faces is dependent on how close the pollutant source is to the building. If the pollutant enters the side region through a closer location to the building, it will more likely pollute the side face. Also, if the pollutant carried by the wind flow exits closer to the side of the building and enter the lee, it is more likely to be trapped in the wake at the lee of the building.

Here some typical position angles were used, according to the regions identified in Fig. 7. Generally, it can be seen that KC decreased with r at any angle and for any face of the building and approaches almost zero at certain large r. When the pollutant was released from the first region (\u03b8\u2208 [0\u00b0, \u03b81]), the pollutant concentration decreased smoothly with an increase of r on all the faces, as shown in Fig. 8(a), (b-1) and (c-1).

Such complicated combined effects of r and \u03b8 are due to the recirculating bubbles formed on the vertical and horizontal planes in this region, as shown in Fig. 9\n. When the pollutant source is situated closer to the center of the bubble and closer to the building, there is more possibility for the pollutant to spread to the building before returning to downstream part of the flow field. Two additional cases at the emission distance of 2.5H and position angles of 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 were further considered and included in the figure. It is shown that for a larger r, if the pollutant was emitted from \u03b8 = 0\u00b0, KC still decreased smoothly with the increase of r; but if the pollutant was emitted from outside of the recirculation bubble (\u03b8 =180\u00b0), Kc on the side face (Fig. 8(b-2)) and leeward face (Fig. 8(b-c)) approached almost zero as the pollutant cannot be returned back to building by the recirculation flow. This highlights the importance of the pollutant source location on the pollutant spreading, in particular not only the distance but also the position angle, as the wind flow field will be very different near different building faces.",

Then the effect of the pollutant source location on the pollutant dispersion to a rectangular building was numerically studied. The normalized pollutant concentration KC as functions of the emission distance r and the emission position angle \u03b8 were quantified and analyzed. The following major conclusions can be drawn based on the results:(1)Generally, KC on the building decreases with an increase in r. However, its behaviour is more complicated with the combination of r and \u03b8. In particular, KC was the highest on the windward face when \u03b8 was near to 0\u00b0 and decreased sharply with the increase of \u03b8. On the side and leeward faces, Kc peaked at both \u03b8 \u2248 0\u00b0 and \u03b8 \u2248 180\u00b0. These features are closely related to the wind flow field near the building. The highest Kc was found on the leeward face when the emission location was at the lee of the building, resulting from the significant recirculation flow there.(2)Two critical values of \u03b8 define three regions around the building ([0\u00b0, \u03b8\n1], [\u03b8\n1\n, \u03b8\n2] and [\u03b8\n1\n,180\u00b0]). KC on the building is significant only when the pollutant source is located in the first and third regions. These regions are dependent on r and different for different faces. In the studied cases, a sector-shaped region around the building can be identified, in which the pollutant emission does not have a significant effect on the building.(3)In general, pollutant emitted from ground level accumulates on the lower levels of a high-rise building and decreases with increase of height. But at different faces, the vertical distributions of Kc will be affected by different vertical flows near the faces.(4)Based on the simulated data, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the overall pollutant concentration on a building face with the pollutant emitted from different locations. The mathematical model shows Kc can be modelled as the superposition of one or two terms in the form of a(Hr)2\u00d7exp(b\u03b8) .Similar mathematical models can also be applicable to the cruciform-shaped building. The mathematical model can give a quantitative overview of the effect of the emission location.\n",
