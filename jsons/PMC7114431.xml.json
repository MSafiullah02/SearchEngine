Bioassay guided purification of MA led to the isolation of the limonoid 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM) that reduces both vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and HSV-1 multiplication in Vero cells (Alch\u00e9 et al., 2003). We have found that a late step in VSV and HSV-1 multiplication cycles is hindered by CDM since glycoproteins (g) B, gC and gD of HSV-1, as well as gG of VSV, are confined to the Golgi apparatus when CDM is added after infection (Barquero et al., 2004, Barquero et al., 2006).",

Supernatants were removed and substituted with the samples to be assayed for TNF-\u03b1 content in successive twofold dilutions and incubated at 38.5 \u00b0C with 5 \u03bcg/ml of Actinomycin D (AcD) (Sidus, Argentina), for 22 h. Cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet 0.05%. To assess TNF-\u03b1 activity, light absorbance at 580 nm of the eluted crystal violet from the samples was measured and compared to a mouse recombinant TNF-\u03b1 standard dilution series (Sigma). The bioassay was specific for TNF-\u03b1 since the activity was neutralized by an antibody against TNF-\u03b1.",

The direct anti-HSV-1 activity of CDM achieved when the compound is supplied after infection has already been demonstrated: CDM affects gB, gC and gD glycoprotein exocytic pathway from NHC and Vero cells, confining them to the Golgi complex (Barquero et al., 2006). Now, we demonstrate that CDM also affects the trafficking of, at least, gD glycoprotein of HSV-1 by exerting an analogous antiviral effect in HCLE cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the hindrance of HSV-1 multiplication by CDM is responsible for the inhibition of NF- \u03baB translocation in corneal cells (Fig. 2A).

            "text": "IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are some of the numerous cytokines known to be upregulated following HSV-1 ocular infection (Biswas and Rouse, 2005). The significant reduction in IL-6 secretion detected in supernatants from CDM treated-infected epithelial cells and macrophages would be related to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB translocation by CDM, as a result of its antiviral activity (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). On the contrary, the strong increase of TNF-\u03b1 secretion in J774A.1 CDM-treated infected cells observed in the absence of NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 3C) would be exerted through an alternative NF-\u03baB cell signaling pathway, such as the activation of distinct mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades (Diao et al., 2005, Zachos et al., 1999). This possibility might be supported by the fact that CDM enhanced levels of TNF-\u03b1 production, decreased IL-6 secretion and did not impede NF-\u03baB translocation when J774A.1 cells were induced with LPS rather than infected with HSV-1 (Fig. 4).",

If this is the case, we would argue that the strong increase of TNF-\u03b1 secretion together with IL-6 reduction due to CDM could be responsible for the inhibition of neovascularization registered when mice were infected in the cornea with HSV-1 and treated with MA.",
