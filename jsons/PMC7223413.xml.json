            "text": "In tropical and subtropical regions, wherever there is poor hygiene and sanitation, helminthic infection is very common [1]. Strongyloidiasis is caused by a soil dwelling nematode helminth, Strongyloides stercoralis. As a parasite, it resides in the small intestine of a human being. Strongyloides stercoralis infection was first reported in the year 1876 in French soldiers working in Vietnam [2]. In most of the cases, the intestinal strongyloidiasis does not produce any symptoms. A rare and characteristic feature of autoinfection occurs in its life cycle. As a result, whenever there is an immune imbalance between the host and the parasite, life-threatening complications like hyper infection syndrome and disseminated tissue infestation can occur [3\u20135]. First report of hyper infection syndrome and disseminated infection appeared in patients with immune suppression in the year 1966 [6]. In hyper infection syndrome, the extensive larval proliferation leads to systemic sepsis and multi-organ failure. Normally, the larvae are present in the traditional life cycle sites such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract or lungs. Sometimes, the larvae may be found in heart, brain, muscle, etc., and then it is known as disseminated disease. Most of the patients with hyper infection syndrome often have catastrophic clinical manifestations such as shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, meningitis, renal failure and respiratory failure. Sometimes, the patient may present with acute abdomen as in our case. An elderly diabetic patient presented with the features of acute abdomen found to have gangrenous small bowel on exploratory laparotomy. The cause for his catastrophic presentation was found to be strongyloidiasis hyper infection syndrome, revealed on histopathological examination of the resected specimen.",

On examination, he was febrile, ill-looking patient with tachycardia and tachypnoea. Local examination of abdomen revealed distended, tender abdomen with rigidity. There was clinical evidence of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity, and bowel sounds were absent. Clinical diagnosis of peritonitis as a result of hollow viscous perforation was made. Plain radiograph of the chest and upper abdomen in erect position revealed the presence of free air under both domes of the diaphragm. Total leukocyte count was raised with eosinophilia. The blood sugar levels were raised and controlled with insulin prior to surgery. The serum creatinine was raised to 2.2 mg%. The patient was taken up for emergency exploratory laparotomy. On midline laparotomy, there was evidence of bile-stained free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Approximately 30 cm of jejunal loop, 40 cm from the duodeno-jejunal junction was found to have multiple patches of dusky hue colour on the jejunal serosal surface. There were multiple small perforations in the same jejunal loop (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "About 1.5% to 2.5% of patients harbouring the parasite, Strongyloides stercoralis may present with two different clinical entities known as hyper infection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis [8]. In hyper infection syndrome, the classic life cycle is exaggerated, resulting in an increase in the parasitic burden as a result of autoinfection [5]. Although hyper infection can occur in any host, the incidence is more common in immunocompromised individuals. Disseminated disease is defined by the presence of parasite outside of the traditional life cycle sites, i.e. in organs other than the skin, lungs and gastrointestinal tract [9]. The parasite can be seen in organs such as liver, muscle, heart and central nervous system. When compared with hyper infection syndrome, disseminated disease occurs mainly in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant patients, patients receiving steroids or immunosuppressants or patients infected with human T cell lymphotropic virus type [10]. The clinical presentation of hyper infection syndrome is similar to that of classic strongyloidiasis, involving gastrointestinal tract and lungs, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, weight loss, abdominal pain, GI haemorrhage, subacute intestinal obstruction or eosinophilic granulomas producing enterocolitis, cough, fever and dyspnoea [11, 12]. However, due to increased parasitic burden, some of these patients often have catastrophic clinical manifestations as in our case.",

Most of these patients present with non-specific clinical features, and the laboratory, imaging and endoscopic findings are often non-contributory also as in our case. Moreover, most of the patients present decades later, after primary infection. However, in some cases due to the large parasitic burden, the yield in lung, bronchial and small bowel biopsies is very high, and the diagnosis is possible [11]. It can cause life-threatening infection in an immunocompromised host with 60%\u201385% mortality rate [15]. Steroid therapy, human T cell leukaemia, HIV infection, malignancy, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, collagen vascular disease and chronic alcoholic consumption can cause life-threatening complications in strongyloidiasis. Life-threatening gastrointestinal complications include gastrointestinal bleeding from micro aneurysms in the mesenteric vessels or infarction and perforation of the intestine from local intestinal wall venous thrombosis as in our case [16]. Sometimes, strongyloidiasis is associated with gut translocation of bacteria leading to polymicrobial bacteraemia and septicaemia [17]. Commonly associated bacteria include Gram-negative rods such as Escherichia coli and Gram-positive cocci such as Streptococcus bovis. In fact, the positive blood culture of Streptococcus bovis in a patient may suggest the presence of strongyloidiasis or gastrointestinal malignancy [18]. However, in our patient, blood culture did not reveal any bacterial growth though we subjected only one specimen for culture. Most probably, in our patient as a result of hyper infection syndrome, the infective filariform larvae must have penetrated into the jejunal wall layers as denoted by the presence of larvae in the resected specimen. These infective larvae must have produced eosinophilic granulomas and thrombosis of local jejunal wall veins. Once the jejunal vasculature was pathologically involved, it must have produced patches of ischaemia and multiple small perforations. At the time of laparotomy in our case, the mesenteric vasculature, both arteries and veins were found to be normal. Moreover, in our case, very limited length of small bowel was found to be affected; only 30 cm long jejunum was affected, unlike a typical mesenteric ischaemia. In addition, there must have been translocation of enteral bacteria resulting in polymicrobial septicaemia as our patient died of multi-organ failure secondary to septicaemia. This type of scenario is very common in diabetics and in people with chronic alcohol consumption as in our patient.",

Multiple case reports exist of patients with fatal outcome after treatment with steroids for an unrelated condition and the pathologist later demonstrated disseminated strongyloidiasis [20]. By and large, the clinical features of strongyloidiasis vary depending on the acuity of infection and the underlying host response [21]. So, it is very important to consider the possibility of strongyloidiasis in any immunocompromised patient who suddenly deteriorates. And more over, delay or inability to diagnose strongyloidiasis frequently results in death despite treatment.",

Anthelminthic agents like benzimidazoles (thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole) disrupt energy production in the parasite as a result of disruption of cytoplasmic microtubule formation, thus killing both adult parasites and sterilize the larvae and eggs [22]. Oral administration of Tab. Ivermectin 200 micrograms per Kg body weight gives a very good response. It inhibits the neurotransmission in the parasite and soon eradicates the parasite from the host [23].",
