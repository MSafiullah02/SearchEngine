            "text": "The Flaviviridae family contains several important human and animal pathogens, including dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, hepatitis C, Zika, and bovine viral diarrhea viruses. The family is currently divided into four genera, Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, Pestivirus, and Pegivirus [1]. Members of the Flavivirus genus are capable of replicating in both insect and vertebrate hosts [2,3]. Hepaciviruses, pestiviruses, and pegiviruses were each considered until recently to be exclusively viruses of mammals [4,5]. Despite extensive genetic divergence, all current members of the Flaviviridae have an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of less than 13 kb. The genome is translated into a single polyprotein that is cleaved by host and viral proteases into structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. The genes for the structural proteins, including a capsid protein C and two glycoproteins, are encoded at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, whereas the genes for the NS proteins are 3\u2032. The genes for NS2B-NS3 (protease/helicase) and NS5 (methyltransferase /RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) are the most conserved amongst the family [4].",

In a remarkable metatranscriptomic study Shi, Lin, Vasilakis, Tian et al. retrieved complete genomes of 12 distant Flaviviridae virus relatives (\u201cflavi-like\u201d viruses) from a range of invertebrate species, including flies, crickets, centipedes, spiders, and barnacles [4]. Although these viruses diverge from known flaviruses and have genomes that are larger (16\u201326 kb), they have a similar overall genome organization, polyprotein expression strategy and significance sequence similarities in the NS2B-NS3 and NS5 genes. The wide diversity of flavi-like viruses in invertebrates, coupled with their deep phylogenetic positions, lead the authors to hypothesize that insect flavi-like viruses may represent the ancestral forms from which vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses evolved.",

They have long genomes, a flavi-like genome organization, and sequence similarities to flavivirus NS3 and NS5 genes. In addition, a virus from Proscyllium habereri, the graceful catshark, has significant sequence and genome structure similarities to hepaciviruses [4].

Qin, Shi, Tian, Lin et al. [7] detected Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) in Rhipicephalus microplus ticks in Hubei Province, China. Common 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) nucleotide sequences, including the termini, were present in all four segments, confirming that the JMTV genome is segmented. Segment 1 encodes a protein that has canonical motifs for methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase found in NS5 of unsegmented flaviviruses. Segment 3 encodes a protein with similarities to the flaviviral serine protease domain and helicase domains of NS3 are well as NS2B. Segments 2 and 4 appear to encode the glycoproteins and capsid of JMTV, respectively, but sequence homology searches (BLASTx and BLASTp) found no similarities to any flavivirus proteins [7]. However, homology searches found matches of JMTV segments to the transcripts of a larval cDNA library of Toxocara canis, a helminth parasite of dogs and other canids. The four RNAs identified belong to a virus related to JMTV, which was named T. canis larva agent (TCLA).",

Because they are genetically related to each other, we refer to these viruses as Wuhan flavi-like viruses after the type species, Wuhan cricket virus (WHCV). The genome of Wuhan flavi-like viruses consists of four segments, with a gene organization like that of Jingmen flavi-like viruses. Wuhan flavi-like viruses lack the poly(A) tail present at the end of each Jingmen flavi-like virus segment. Like Jingmen flavi-like viruses, segments 1 and 3 of Wuhan flavi-like viruses share sequence similarities with the NS2B-NS3 and NS5 genes of flaviviruses. Despite genetic relatedness and other similarities, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has not included flavi-like viruses in the Flaviviridae [1]. The non-segmented divergent flavi-like viruses of arthropods, and the segmented Jingmen and Wuhan group viruses are not formally classified. Jingmen and Wuhan flavi-like viruses could potentially be assigned to a Jingmenivirus genus within the Flaviviridae, or they could be given a separate classification.",

Secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane helices, globular regions, coiled-coil regions, and other protein features were analyzed using PredictProtein [33]. Domains with a significant propensity to form transmembrane helices were identified with TMpred [34]. TMpred is based on a statistical analysis of TMbase, a database of naturally occurring transmembrane glycoproteins [35]. Topology and other features of membrane proteins were explored by means of hydropathy plots with Membrane Protein eXplorer (MPeX) from the Stephen White laboratory [36]. MPeX is based on the experimentally determined Wimley\u2013White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) [37,38]. The presence of signal peptides and the location of their cleavage sites was analyzed using Signalp (v5.0), which is based on deep convolutional and recurrent neural network architecture, including a conditional random field [39]. O-linked glycosylation sites were predicted by Net-O-Glyc v. 4.0 [40]. The NetOglyc server produces neural network predictions of mucin type GalNAc O-glycosylation sites.",

Another group of novel genetically-related segmented flavi-like viruses has been discovered in insects (Wuhan flavi-like viruses) [4]. The gene order of nonsegmented flaviviruses of the Flavivirus genus is 5\u2032 capsid-PrM-envelope-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3\u2032 (Figure 1). Segment 4 of Jingmen and Wuhan flavi-like viruses encode a capsid protein and a membrane protein. No sequence similarity can be detected between the capsid proteins of segmented or nonsegmented flaviviruses. The capsid proteins of Jingmen flavi-like viruses ALSV and JMTV share substantial amino acid similarities (75% identical and 93% similar amino acids over a 252 amino acid segment). There is limited similarity of the capsid proteins of ALSV and JMTV to the capsid of WHCV (16% identical and 57% similar amino acids over an 88 amino acid segment), but not the membrane protein. There is no apparent close homolog of the membrane protein of the flavi-like viruses in nonsegmented flaviviruses. However, M proteins of flavi-like viruses have several TM domains (10 for ALSV). The membrane proteins of ALSV and JMTV are similar to each other, but not closely related WHCV M.",

For example, ALSV VP1a shares 23% identical amino acids and 50% chemically similar amino acids with yellow fever virus (YFV) envelope (E) protein over a 190 amino acid length segment (Figure 1). The glycoproteins of the two subgroups of Jingmen flavi-like viruses also share similarities.

The two Segment 2 glycoproteins, VP1a and VP1b, of ALSV are 481 and 266 amino acids, respectively. VP1a and VP1b of YGTV are 440 and 267 amino acids, respectively. The VP1, VP1a, and VP1b proteins of Jingmen flavi-like viruses have predicted N-terminal signal peptides of 26 to 42 amino acids. JMTV and MGTV VP1 have three predicted TM domains. Prior to the first transmembrae (TM) domain in JMTV and MGTV are two \u03b1-helices predicted by PredictProtein, an advanced secondary structure prediction algorithm. We refer to this region as the stem domain by analogy to the extended \u03b1-helices that are present prior to the TM anchoring domains in the E proteins of members of the Flavivirus genus [41,42,43] and glycoproteins of other viruses [44]. The VP1a of ALSV has a C-terminal TM domain, but VP1a of YGTV does not. Distinct isolates of ALSV and YGTV have the same predicted structures, so this difference in the presence of C-terminal anchors does not appear to be due to sequencing errors. The C-termini of Jingmen flavi-like virus VP1 and VP1b are similar with two TM domains (for a total of three in VP1). VP1 and VP1b contain a segment enriched in negatively charged amino acids followed by a segment enriched in positively charged amino acids.",

Each of the Jingmen flavi-like viruses have an extended patch of predicted O-glycans at the N terminus of the protein following the predicted signal peptide, which we refer to as a mucin-like domain. Jingmen flavi-like viruses also have one to three additional predicted O-glucan between amino acids 230 and 360. The VP1a of ALSV and YGTV and other flavi-like viruses that encode two glycoproteins are distinguished from JMTV and MGTV and other Jingmen flavi-like viruses that encode one glycoprotein in the presence of the C-terminal domain, which we refer to as the leash by analogy to the pre-anchor domains of certain other VFP [28,47].

Fusion peptides or loops are typically among the most highly conserved sequences. Several sequences in Jingmen flavi-like virus VP1 or VP1a proteins fit the canonical profile of a fusion peptide of a class II VFP and produce a positive WWIHS score.

This suggests that the glycoproteins of Jingmen flavi-like virus do not encode class I or III VFPs. Protein Predict indicates that the ectodomains of Jingmen flavi-virus like glycoproteins have a propensity to form a mixture of \u03b2-sheets and short \u03b1-helices. This pattern is reminiscent of class II VFPs [27,54,55], which led us to perform pairwise alignments and visual inspection that can detect the limited similarities with flavivirus E not found in large-scale similarity searches (Figure 1). The ectodomains of flavivirus E have three domains. Domain I is in the center of the molecular and can contain a hinge. Domain II contains the fusion peptide and domain III the receptor binding domain. ALSV VP1a has an extended similarity to YFV E domain III (Figure 2). The region contains a pair of conserved cysteines.

The folding of the glycoprotein must accommodate the location of structure features of the protein and cysteine bonding. Cysteines are usually the most conserved amino acids within a protein family because disulfide linkages are a critical determinant of secondary structure. With the exception of the last cysteine in each of the Jingmen flavi-like virus glycoproteins the cysteines are conserved (Figure 2). Overall, the length and co-linearity of putative fusion loops, class III domains, stem domains (when present) and TM anchors are consistent with the suggestion that Jingmen flavi-like viruses encode modified class II fusion proteins. There are many possible alternatives to the cysteine linkages and secondary structures shown. However, plausible models that conform to the scaffold of the known structure class II VFP can be constructed based on the Jingmen flavi-like virus sequences (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). After scaffolding on YFV E structure (Figure 3), the models for ALSV VP1a (Figure 4) and JMTV VP1 (Figure 5) place predicted structures such as the fusion peptides in appropriate domains. The models also place cysteine residues in close proximity with possible linkages occurring within the three domains, while conforming to the structural predictions of PredictProtein.",

Current models of fusion class II viral fusion proteins suggest that exposure to the low pH of the endosome triggers trimerization and a bending of class II fusion proteins at a flexible \u201chinge\u201d region between domains I and II, elevating the fusion peptide so that it can insert into the host membrane [56,57]. A rearrangement of the stem (pre-anchor region), so that there are more extensive interactions with domains I-III, results in a deformation of the viral and target membranes. Subsequently, the membranes are brought closer together by continued interactions of the stem with domains I-III, which results in bilayer hemifusion [58,59]. The formation of the final post-fusion trimer accompanies complete fusion of the viral and cellular membrane allowing entry of the ribonucleoproteins containing the viral genomic RNA. To examine whether the class II structure of the Jingmen flavi-like viruses could accommodate similar rearrangements, we constructed space-filling models of Jingmen flavi-like virus glycoproteins in dimer and trimer configurations (Figure 6). Mucin-like domains would be exposed on the surface of the proteins. The N-terminal mucin-like domain of both ALSV and JMTV potentially sits on top of the dimer. The mucin-like domain found on the leash of ALSV would be able to occupy the space between the dimers on the virion. The rearrangement of ALSV from a dimer to a trimer could occur with the leash occupying the same groove formed between monomers of the trimer as occupied in the post-fusion form of class II flavivirus E. Likewise, the stem of JMTV VP1 could occupy the same grove occupied by the stem of YFV E in the post-fusion configuration.",

The prM is cleaved by furin or by a furin-like protease during virus release to produce the mature M protein localized on the surface of flavivirus virions. Flavivirus prM/M contains two potential membrane spanning domains, and their functions may include shielding of internal cellular membranes from the fusion peptide of E [61]. E and M are likely present in equal molar amounts in the virion. Each dimer of E/M is associated with eight TM domains (Figure 4, one M is not shown). The E/M trimer would then have twelve TM domains. By comparison, the dimers of Jingmen flavi-like viruses would be associated with six TM in the dimers and nine in the trimer or fewer in the case of YGTV.",

VP1, VP1a, and VP1b each have an amino terminal signal peptide. VP1 and VP1b have one or more TM domains. The VP1a of ALSV also has a TM domain, but the VP1a of YGTV lacks this feature. These observations suggest that segment 2 ALSV and YGTV was derived from segment 2 of a JMTV-like progenitor by mutational events that resulted in termination of the VP1a reading frame, followed by a shift in the reading frame and the insertion of a signal peptide for the VP1b portion of the gene.",

Common structural motifs, including extended \u03b1-helices and an N-terminal fusion peptide, were subsequently observed in the glycoproteins of filoviruses [24], arenaviruses [26], coronaviruses [63], and paramyxoviruses, now referred to collectively as class I VFPs. The envelope glycoproteins of flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and viruses formerly classified as members of the Bunyavirdae, which are now classified in separate families under the order Bunyavirales, form the structurally distinct class II VFPs [55,56]. Class II VFPs are characterized by a \u03b2-sheet structure interspersed with short \u03b1-helices. Rhabdoviruses, herpesviruses, certain baculoviruses, and members of the Thogatovirus genus of the Myxoviridae have class III VFPs [64,65,66]. While no similarity of any Jingmen group virus glycoprotein to other viral glycoprotein has been detected by common homology search programs, application of the methods of Gallaher predicted that Jingmen group virus glycoproteins have structure features of class II viral fusion proteins. These predicted features include an ectodomain consisting of \u03b2-sheets and short \u03b1-helices, a fusion peptide with interfacial hydrophobicity and a three-domain architecture. Confirmation of these predictions will require structural analyses using X-ray crystallography or cryoelectron microscopy.",

Flavi-like viruses possess large unsegmented RNA genomes and occupy deep phylogenetic positions [4]. The Flaviviridae appear to have evolved from an ancestral flavi-like virus of invertebrates (Figure 7). The NS2B-NS3 and NS5 proteins of pestiviruses, one of four genera in the Flaviviridae, are most closely related among flaviviruses to the cognate proteins of unsegmented flavi-like viruses [4]. The structure of the pestivirus glycoprotein differs from the glycoproteins of other flaviviruses [79], which is consistent with a near-basal position of pestiviruses on Flaviviridae phylogenetic trees. Hepacivirus and pegivirus glycoproteins also differ from those of other flaviviruses [80]. The glycoprotein complex consists of two subunits, E1 and E2. However, E2 has an immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold, which it shares with domain III of flavivirus E [81,82]. As suggested previously [80], an ancestral glycoprotein possessing an Ig-like fold could have been the progenitor of hepacivirus, pegivirus and subsequently other flavivirus glycoproteins.",

The NS2B-NS3 and NS5 proteins of Jingmen flavi-like viruses are more closely related to the cognate proteins of members of the Flavivirus genus than to those of the other genera (pestiviruses, hepaciviruses, or pegiviruses) suggesting that Jingmen viruses diverged from a common ancestral virus by the process of genome segmentation (Figure 7). The current studies suggest that flavivirus E and Jingmen flavi-like virus glycoproteins diverged from a common class II precursor glycoprotein. The divergence involved or was followed by the addition of mucin-like domains. A subgroup of Jingmen viruses, including ALSV and YGTV, diverged further by incorporating a frameshift in their segment 2 gene (Figure 7). The mutational events that resulted in the separation of the single ORF into two overlapping ORFs in segment 2 of ALSV and YGTV were also involved or were followed by events that generated a sequence encoding an additional mucin-like domain. Wuhan flavi-like viruses do not encode class II envelope proteins (Figure 7). There are several possibilities that could account for this difference, including divergent evolution or recombination/reassortment to acquire the gene for a distinct class of glycoprotein.",
