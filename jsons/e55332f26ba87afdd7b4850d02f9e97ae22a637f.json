Lactobacillus plantarum -Biocenol TM LP96 (CCM 7512), Lactobacillus fermentum -Biocenol TM LF99 (CCM 7514) and flaxseed (rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) were administered to 36 conventional piglets from a problematic breed with confirmed presence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Coronavirus. The experimental piglets were supplied with probiotic cheeses and crushed flax-seed in the period starting 10 days before weaning and lasting up to 14 days post-weaning. Piglets in the control group were supplied only control cheese. The impact of such additives on the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; spectroscopic and electrophoretic assay), alteration of immunity (index of metabolic activity), jejunum histology (light microscopy), and health of conventional piglets from a problematic breed (monitoring of hematology, consistency and moisture of feces and body temperature) were examined. We found significant decrease in LDH leakage in the blood serum and tissue extracts, indicating better cell membrane integrity in the individual organs of animals. Probiotics and flaxseed applied together seem to be a good source of nutrients to improve the immune status and the integrity of jejunum mucosa during infection.",

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the major reason for diarrhea in sucklings and weanlings, leading to excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes, resulting in profuse diarrhea, usually without histological lesions (Wilson & Francis 1986; Francis 2002) . Infections caused by Coronavirus (Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, PEDV; Mole 2013) are among the other diseases causing diarrhea and vomiting in this breed of piglets. Inflammation caused by ETEC may be effectively inhibited by the application of suitable immunomodulatory agents demonstrated in numerous experimental studies of piglets (Shirkey et al. 2006; Tohno et al. 2006; Walsh et al. 2008; Mizumachi et al. 2009; Chytilov\u00e1 et al. 2013) . Diet supplementation with probiotics has been shown to: (i) reduce the frequency of post-weaning diarrhea (Manner & Spieler 1997) ; (ii) play an important role in the intestinal barrier against inflammatory bowel disease (Laukoetter et al. 2008) ; and (iii) improve growth performance (Scheuermann 1993) in piglets.",

Health data were recorded twice daily (at 08.00 and 15.00 hours), specifically, body temperature (BT), consistency of feces (F) and moisture of feces (MF). Samples of feces were assessed visually using a scale from 1 to 5, where the number 1 meant solid feces, 2 paste, 3 sparse, 4 hydrous and 5 feces with an admixture of blood or mucus. The moisture of feces was determined by drying a sample of feces at 80\u00b0C to constant weight. Blood samples from piglets were taken from the plexus venosus suborbitalis on Day 0 (day of weaning; n = 6), Day 7 (n = 6) and Day 14 (n = 6) after weaning. Blood serum was separated from blood samples by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C and 1095 \u00d7 g for 10 min for determination of total LDH (TLDH) and its isoenzymes (LDH 1 -LDH 5) expressed in \u03bckat/L and for measurement of leukocytes. On sampling days, the piglets were humanely sacrificed (euthanased) using T61 a.u.v. (Intervet International BV, Boxmeer, Netherlands) intracardiac administration of 1 mL/kg/head. Heart, liver and skeletal muscle were collected from each pig and processed (tissue homogenates or extracts) until other analyses were done. The samples were cut into small pieces, and washed in buffered saline to remove excess blood and connective tissue. Two grams of tissue were then homogenized in 20 volumes of cold buffer (0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3) in line with Heinov\u00e1 et al. (1999) . Protein concentration was measured in accordance with Bradford (1976) and TLDH and its isoenzymes (LDH 1 -LDH 5) were expressed in international units per gram of protein (IU/g).",

Intracellular LDH (EC. 1.1.1.27), L-(+)-lactate: NAD + oxidoreductase leakage is a possible indicator of cell membrane integrity and cell viability (Legrand et al. 1992) . LDH catalyses the intraconversion of pyruvate and lactate and is involved in both the catabolism and anabolism of carbohydrates. In addition to metabolic roles in the cells, it includes a number of other biological processes (Powers et al. 1991) . The function of specific indicators is performed by LDH isoenzymes, which allow us to identify the damage to cells and tissues by different agents. LDH leakage from various cells (e.g. hepatocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes) into the environment is used as one of the markers of cytotoxicity for monitoring tissue and cell damage in in vitro conditions (Kopperschl\u00e4ger and Kirchberrger 1996; \u0160utiakov\u00e1 et al. 2004) . Moreover, mean values between columns with the same superscript letters are statistically significant at levels a = P < 0.05; b = P < 0.01. lactic acid level reflects the quantitative transformation of glycogen, and indicates typical or atypical processes of meat ripening (Kor\u00e9nekov\u00e1 et al. 2009 ).",
