The Sylvatic genotype circulates in a sylvatic cycle, while the American, American/Asian, Asian 1, Asian 2 and Cosmopolitan genotypes circulate in urban cycle (Wang et al., 2000). Inferred evolutionary relationships of DENV suggest that the urban genotypes evolved from sylvatic lineages due to several cross-species transmission events into humans, followed by the recent (i.e., early 20th century) evolution of urban forms (Messina et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2000; Wei and Li, 2017). Notably, environmental and social factors such as the introduction of the anthropophilic vector, urbanization, deforestation and the increased human travel and trade have facilitated the emergence, spread and evolution of DENV into human populations (Mayer et al., 2017; Parvez and Parveen, 2017). Elements such as genetic composition and pathogen-host interaction are believed to be involved in different patterns of transmissibility (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003; Lara-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2014; Lequime et al., 2016; Lobo et al., 2009).",

            "text": "The degeneracy of the genetic code refers to the fact that a single amino acid can be coded by different codons. The redundancy in the genetic code has an important role in controlling metabolic processes, but not all species use its built-in codon redundancy in the same way. The unequal preference of specific codons over other synonymous codons during the translation process creates a bias in codon usage. Codon usage biases are common throughout the Tree of Life, and for viruses, the balance between mutation and natural selection allows for changes in codon usage biases (Morton, 2003). Genetic plasticity and the capacity to adapt to new hosts facilitate the emergence of RNA viruses in novel, unexplored environments. This process entails both, (i) adapting to different types of cellular machinery involved in viral replication and (ii) the evasion from different types of cellular antiviral responses. However, the mechanisms used for virus for trafficking among hosts remain poorly understood (Bahir et al., 2009; Longdon et al., 2014; Pal et al., 2014). Because DENV must infect successfully and alternate between mosquito and human hosts, nucleotide analyses support the notion that arboviruses use a restricted and balanced nucleotide composition as a compromise to be able to infect both hosts, thus successfully ensuring several processes such as translational efficiency and replication (Shen et al., 2015). In this context, the Codon adaptation index (CAI) correlates with gene expression levels and adaptation of viral genes to their hosts (Gustafsson et al., 2012; Neame, 2009; Pal et al., 2014). In the present study, we performed comprehensive analyses of codon adaptation of DENV-2 from different habitat settings and host systems.",

We applied the CAI using a frequency table for housekeeping of human genes (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013) (available at https://github.com/CaioFreire/CUB) and for Ae. aegypti using the table available in the Codon Usage Database (Nakamura, 2000). The CAI values were calculated to measure the synonymous codon usage bias using the CAIcal program (Puigb\u00f2 et al., 2008a). To evaluate the statistical support of the CAI values, we define a threshold value or expected CAI (e-CAI) (Puigb\u00f2 et al., 2008b) by generating random sequences with GC content, amino acid composition and sequence length similar to the DENV-2 query sequences. CAI values above the e-CAI are interpreted as statistically significant, meaning that codon similarity arises from codon preferences rather than from internal biases (Puigb\u00f2 et al., 2008b).",

This was also reported for other flavivirus (Butt et al., 2016; Freire et al., 2015; Moratorio et al., 2013; Pal et al., 2014). In addition, similar CAI values recovered for urban and sylvatic genotypes suggests their ability to possibly make similar use of human cellular machinery. This notion is consistent with kinetic experiments comparing the replication of sylvatic and urban DENV-2 strains, which could explain that the emergence of urban DENV-2 from sylvatic progenitors may not have required adaptation to replicate more efficiently in humans (Vasilakis et al., 2007b). Notwithstanding, when using the CAI tables from Ae. aegypti, we observed a conspicuous difference between urban and sylvatic genotypes with lower CAI values for the sylvatic genotype (Fig. 2). This finding suggested that the emergence of urban genotypes into the urban cycle may have required viral adaptation towards increased competence in Ae. aegypti, which should then entail higher efficiency in viral replication. This is in good agreement with susceptibility experiments reported by Moncayo et al. (2004). Furthermore, competence studies with Ae. aegypti from regions where sylvatic genotype circulation occurs indicate its low vector capacity for Dengue virus (Amarasinghe et al., 2011; Diallo et al., 2008). Despite this, there was no previous attempt to establish an association with codon usage biases.",

            "text": "Fluctuations in CAI distribution across genotypes (Fig. 1B) indicated possible differences in codon adaptation for both hosts (Table 1). Differential selection pressures exerted by the complex interplay of distinct virus factors, such as infection efficiency, population density and herd immunity (Plowright et al., 2017; Salazar et al., 2010). For example, a recent study reported by Salje et al. (2017) demonstrated the association between population density and the establishment of transmission chains. The increase in mosquito populations has also been identified as a potential determinant of the emergence and increased transmission of arbovirus, particularly in immunologically na\u00efve human populations (Dudas et al., 2018; Pettersson et al., 2016). Our findings bring into question whether sylvatic strains could reach similar levels of transmission as the urban genotypes in Asian and American populations if the vector competence of Ae.aegypti is increased. In fact, recent outbreaks caused by other emerging viruses [e.g. Ebola virus, Influenza A virus (H1N1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)], have occurred due to the zoonotic spillover and adaptation of the virus to replication in human cells (Dudas et al., 2018; M\u00e4nz et al., 2016; Plowright et al., 2017; Urbanowicz et al., 2016). In this context, as previous analyses have suggested (Moncayo et al., 2004), our findings support the notion that for the sylvatic strains to effectively colonize the urban environment, the virus needs a number of silent, adaptive nucleotide substitutions to optimize the codon usage to invertebrate host cells, while maintaining a compositional base balance suitable for efficient alternate spread among both human and insect hosts. Apparently, even when humans are susceptible to infection by DENV vectored by Ae. aegypti, its reduced vectorial competence ultimately constitutes a hurdle rather than an enabler of virus transmission.",

In this context, although the virus replicates in both human and mosquitoes, our analysis suggested that DENV-2 codon usage is better adapted to humans than to the main cosmopolitan vector (Ae. aegypti). This would imply that there is still room for adaptation and improved transmission among new DENV-2 strains for causing future pandemics.",
