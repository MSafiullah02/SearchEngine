Unlike other bacteria, they lack rigid cell wall structures and are therefore not susceptible to antibiotics that interfere with cell wall synthesis, such as beta-lactams. Most of the Mycoplasma species that can be found in humans act as commensals on mucosal surfaces. However, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infections, particularly in children and young adults, and related to the syndrome of atypical pneumonia. Other human pathogenic species include M. genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and M. hominis, which can cause urogenital infections.",

She complained of a mild cough producing whitish mucus, hoarseness, headache, and musculoskeletal pain for the previous 2 days. Vital signs were normal (blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg, heart rate 80 beats/min, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, oral temperature 36.4\u00b0C). On examination, there was an exsudate of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Auscultation of the lungs was normal. Laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 11,000/\u03bcL, ESR normal, C-reactive protein moderately elevated (6.6 mg/dL, reference range < 0.5 mg/dL), capillary blood gas analysis while breathing ambient air: pO2 82.9 mm Hg, pCO2 32 mm Hg, pH 7.457, O2-Sat. 97%. Surprisingly, the environmental history revealed that her spouse had a Mycoplasma pneumoniae-induced pneumonia complicated by a Stevens-Johnson Syndrome 2 weeks prior. Our patient\u2019s symptoms were mild and compatible with, but not specific for M. pneumoniae infection (1). Yet, we considered the diagnosis for the following reasons: clear history of exposure, cough producing sputum, and musculoskeletal pain. A chest X-ray study was performed, which showed an infiltrate of the right upper lobe (Figure 1). The diagnosis of pneumonia, most likely secondary to M. pneumoniae, was established. Empiric antibiotic treatment against Mycoplasma was initiated according to current recommendations using a macrolide, in this case erythromycin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. for 14 days (2, 3). A throat swab or sputum culture was not performed. The patient was discharged from the ED. On ambulatory follow-up after 1 week, the patient was symptom-free and infection with Mycoplasma could be confirmed by a 10-fold increase in anti-Mycoplasma IgG-titer (20.4 U/mL at presentation, 200.0 U/mL after 7 days), whereas IgM was normal at both times. A control pulmonary chest X-ray study (not shown) 28 days after presentation was normal.",

For most complications, secondary autoimmunity has been suggested to be responsible (10). The most severe form of skin complication is the Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) occurring in up to 7% of cases of Mycoplasma pneumonia (3, 13), preferentially affecting young males and characterized by a generalized exanthema, high fever, mucositis and catarrhal symptoms (14). In pediatric patients, SJS is almost exclusively caused by M. pneumoniae infection, whereas a similar skin rash, Erythema multiforme, which is less severe, has a different body-distribution and histology is mainly due to Herpes simplex infection (14). In the adult population, SJS is mostly drug-induced (15). Drugs that have been implicated in this mechanism include antimicrobial sulfonamides, aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, NSAID oxicams, allopurinol, steroids, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and the muscle-relaxant chlormezanone, which has now been withdrawn from many markets (15, 16). Immediate discontinuation of offending drugs has been shown to reduce fatal outcomes (17). Hence, if SJS occurs under treatment for M. pneumoniae, the antimicrobial class should be switched immediately (13).",

            "text": "However, in the ED, bedside testing for cold agglutinin (CA) is of potential interest (see Table 3\nfor instructions). The formation of CA is a non-specific early IgM reaction against the red cell \u201cI\u201d antigen that develops in about 50% of all patients 1\u20132 weeks after infection (3, 18). According to one series of patients with positive Mycoplasma serology, the incidence of CA is highest in the pediatric population (95% of patients aged 0\u201319 years) and decreases with age (82% between age 20 and 39 years; 51% at age 40) (19). Mild forms of hemagglutination may also occur with other conditions (e.g., viral infection, vasculitis, lymphoma), leading to a loss in specificity (3, 18). Of those, Influenza is the most important confounder (causing CA in 20% of seropositive cases), whereas the other conditions usually preclude suspicion of a M. pneumoniae infection on clinical grounds alone (19). In the appropriate clinical setting (i.e., when a lower respiratory tract infection is suspected, or e.g., in the presence of a skin rash), positive CA testing is usually very suggestive and helpful for diagnosing M. pneumoniae infection (3, 10). This is also illustrated by a series of patients with lower respiratory infection (22% prevalence of M. pneumoniae), where the sensitivity and specificity of the cold agglutin test were 78.3% and 92%, respectively, using a cutoff titer of \u2265 1:64 (19). The bedside version of the test normally turns positive at the same titer (2, 3). Until recently, hemagglutination has been the most widely used routine laboratory test for M. pneumoniae infection (3, 10). Since the advent of highly specific serology (see below), the usefulness of CA testing has been questioned by many authors (18). However, recent data demonstrate a reasonable test validity in the appropriate clinical setting, suggesting that the CA test may have been underestimated (19).",

Serology becomes positive 1\u20132 weeks after the onset of symptoms. IgM leads the serologic response and is practically always present in children, whereas it is often absent from young adult age onwards due to the experience of reinfection\u2014the majority of adults over 40 years of age has an isolated IgG response, as seen in our patient (20); IgA then may serve as a substitute early response marker (18). In the past, Ig has been assayed by complement fixation (CF) testing [sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 94%, respectively (18)]. Nowadays the superior EIA techniques are in use, yielding a sensitivity and specificity of 97.8% and 99.7%, respectively, when both IgM and IgG are measured (20). Ig testing is considered positive either with a titer 1:32 or a fourfold increase in titer of paired serum samples taken 2\u20133 weeks apart, as was the case in our patient (10). Elevated IgM and IgG levels persist for several months and years, respectively (8). Importantly and of note to emergency physicians, commercial rapid bedside tests for IgM or IgG and requiring < 10 min have recently been developed, representing a potentially useful but costly (> $10 per test) alternative to bedside agglutinins for immediate results (21). For unpaired samples, sensitivity is roughly similar to cold agglutinin testing (2, 19, 21). Direct unamplified antigen tests of the sputum such as the indirect immune assay, antigen-capture EIA, and the direct nucleotide detection are scarcely used today because they are both insensitive (requirement for high antigen densities in the sample) and unspecific (due to cross-reactivities with other Mycoplasma species of the respiratory tract) (10). The PCR nucleic acid amplification methods can provide results with 100% specificity within 1 day. Yet sensitivity is currently around 60% and testing is available as routine in only few centers. However, these methods may become much more important in the future as their validation progresses (10). Mycoplasma culture of throat swabs, sputum, or organ tissue (sensitivity around 60%) requires meticulous handling of the specimen, elaborate microbiological testing, and takes up to 4 weeks to grow (10). Hence, it is mainly used in clinical studies and in the management of extrapulmonary complications, but not for routine (3, 10).",

According to current guidelines, first-line options against bacterial agents of atypical pneumonias including M. pneumoniae consist of a macrolide or a tetracycline (2, 3). If needed (e.g., in case of a suspected adverse reaction to a first-line antibiotic), newer Quinolones would be an alternative, e.g., Levofloxacin or Moxifloxacin (22). Although M. pneumoniae infection can be self-limited, antibiotic treatment is believed to alleviate the severity of the symptoms, and shorten the course of the disease when compared to no treatment (2, 22). The fact that treatment leads to negative PCR for Mycoplasma within 24 h further suggests that it may also reduce infectivity and spread among family members (10). Indeed, antibiotic prophylaxis has proven effective in preventing spread of the infection in close communities, such as among military recruits (3). At present it is unknown if extrapulmonary complications such as the SJS can be avoided by very early anti-mycoplasmal treatment (2).",
