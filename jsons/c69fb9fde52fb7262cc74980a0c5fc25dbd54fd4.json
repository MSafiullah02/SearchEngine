Over the course of a 7-month period, nasopharyngeal-wash samples from 2 (7.7%) of 26 consecutive children with KS and 4 (7.7%) of 52 matched control subjects tested positive for HCoV-NL63 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These data suggest that, although HCoV-NL63 was circulating in children in our community during the time of the study, the prevalence of infection with HCoV-NL63 was not greater in patients with KS than in control subjects.",

Although the etiology of KS remains unknown, accumulated evidence suggests an infectious cause. Focal epidemics with a wavelike spread of illness have been reported in many countries. Outbreaks of KS usually occur during the winter and spring. The clinical features are characteristic of a severe, acute childhood infection. The peak incidence is in the toddler age group, with only rare cases in adults, which suggests widespread immunity to a common infectious agent. Similarly, the rarity of cases in infants !3 months old suggests the possibility of protection by passively acquired maternal antibodies [2, 3] .",

Recently, an association was reported between KS and the New Haven (NH) strain of a newly identified human coronavirus (HCoV), HCoV-NL63 [4] . HCoV-NL63 was initially discovered by researchers in The Netherlands who used a novel method to look for unidentified viral pathogens in children with lowerrespiratory-tract disease [5] . Other researchers found the same virus by searching, using broad-reacting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets specific for the Coronaviridae family, for previously unknown HCoVs in respiratory samples from children [6] . The NH strain of HCoV-NL63 was discovered by screening respiratory samples with primers that targeted conserved regions of the CoV replicase 1a gene [7] . Using primers that were specific for the spike and replicase 1a genes of the NH strain of HCoV-NL63, Esper et al. [4] detected viral sequences in respiratory specimens from 8 (72.7%) of 11 patients with acute KS but in only 1 (4.5%) of 22 concurrently collected specimens from age-matched control subjects.",

However, since the initial report of the association of HCoV-NL63 with KS, no case-control studies have been conducted. Denver has a relatively high incidence of KS, and the majority of patients with KS admitted to our institution have a nasopharyngeal wash collected as part of their diagnostic workup.

As part of an ongoing epidemiological investigation of respiratory viruses at The Children's Hospital in Denver, from November 2004 to November 2005, we archived at \u03ea70\u040aC all respiratory specimens that tested negative by direct immunofluorescence (DFA) for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, and adenovirus. For each patient with KS who had a banked respiratory specimen, we identified at least 2 matched control subjects from our archived specimens. Control subjects were matched by age (within 6 months if !5 years old and within 1 year if 15 years old) and by date of specimen collection (within 1 week of the case patient). All respiratory specimens used in the study were nasopharyngeal washes. All control and KS samples came from the same pool of samples that were negative for the 7 respiratory viruses tested by DFA. Use of banked specimens and clinical data was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. All samples (from case patients and control subjects) were identified and coded at The Children's Hospital microbiology/virology laboratory and then transferred to the University of Colorado Health Science Center laboratory (Aurora, CO) for blinded analysis for HCoV-NL63 RNA by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR.",

Specimens were screened for the presence of HCoV-NL63 by RT-PCR using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random primers, followed by PCR and/or nested PCR. Amplicons were analyzed in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. On the basis of results published elsewhere, 8 different primer sets were used [4, 5, 13] . Multiple primer sets were used purposely because of the potential variations in specificity and sensitivity caused by variations in the nucleotide sequences of different HCoV-NL63 strains. Primer sets had binding sites located within the HCoV-NL63 (NH strain) spike gene (primer set A, with nested primers B) [4] , HCoV-NL63 (NH strain) replicase 1a gene (primer set C) [4] , HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein gene (primer set D) [13] , and HCoV-NL63 replicase 1b gene (primer set E with nested primer set F) [5] . Additionally, 2 sets of degenerate coronavirus primers (G and H) [4] were designed using the conserved region of the replicase 1b gene. HotStarTaq (Qiagen) was used in all PCRs, and PCR amplification programs were run as described elsewhere for each primer set. Primer set H was designed in our laboratory on the basis of a conserved region shared by HCoV-NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43. Primer set H consisted of forward primer 5 -GCGCAAAATAATGAATTAATGCC-3 and reverse primer 5 -CAATACAWACAAAYAGACGCWCC-ACC-3 (W, A + T; Y, C + T).

The clinical summaries of the HCoV-NL63-positive patients are shown in table 3. The first patient with KS was an 18-month-old boy who presented with 6 days of fever, diffuse rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, red and cracked lips, strawberry tongue, and swelling and erythema of his hands and feet. His nasopharyngeal-wash sample, collected on day 6 of his illness, was positive for HCoV-NL63. Laboratory studies were notable for aseptic meningitis, sterile pyuria, thrombocytosis, increased alanine aminotransferase levels, and hypoalbuminemia. In addition to classic symptoms of KS, he also had a very pronounced croupy cough, tachypnea, and several bouts of emesis. He clinically responded to 1 infusion of IVIG but was found to have bilateral saccular coronary aneurysms on a 2-week follow-up echocardiogram. The second patient with KS was a 3-year-old boy who presented with 14 days of rash, 6 days of fever, bilateral conjunctivitis, red lips, strawberry tongue, and swollen hands. He received 1 dose of IVIG, was hospitalized for 4 days, and was discharged after he became afebrile and his inflammatory markers had decreased. A nasopharyngeal-wash sample obtained at day 6 of fever (day 14 of rash) during this hospitalization was negative for HCoV-NL63. He presented again to the emergency room for evaluation for possible recurrent KS, 26 days after discharge, with a 3-day history of fever, rash, red eyes, sore throat, and abdominal pain. Repeat inflammatory markers measured at that time were all normal. The patient was evaluated by the infectious disease consultation service, which found no evidence for recurrent KS, and he was discharged from the emergency department with a diagnosis of viral syndrome. Two nasopharyngeal-wash samples obtained on days 2 and 3 of this second illness (25 and 26 days after discharge for the KS admission) were both positive for HCoV-NL63.",

Nasopharyngeal-wash specimens are routinely collected from patients with KS, regardless of the presence or absence of upper-respiratory-tract symptoms, to search for viral respiratory pathogens that may be producing rash and fever or coinfecting patients with clinical KS.

In a recent report that examined infants with lower-respiratory-tract infections, Kaiser et al.

[20] discovered that an antigen detected by immunohistochemical analysis using synthetic KS antibodies in ciliated bronchial epithelium from patients with acute KS is found in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are consistent with aggregates of viral proteins.
