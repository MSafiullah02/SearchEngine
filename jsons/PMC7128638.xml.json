Among this family, IFITM1, 2, and 3 are expressed basally in various tissues and cells [1], [4], which are involved in immune cell signaling, cell adhesion, oncogenesis, germ cell physiology, and regulation of endocytosis [5].",

IFITM proteins are the only known innate immune effector that inhibits viral entry. They suppressed infection of retroviruses pseudotyped with entry proteins of IFITM-restricted viruses [6], [7], [8], which firstly localized the IFITM-mediated restriction to the entry step in the virus replication cycle. Imaging studies provided direct evidence that IFITM proteins prevent viruses from fusing with late endosomal or lysosomal membranes [7], [12], most likely through reducing membrane fluidity and fusion potential [13].",

Likemammals, fish possess IFN-mediated innate immune defense against viral infection [17], [18], [19]. Some studies suggested that the IFITM-mediated restriction might be a conserved characteristic in vertebrates [20]. Indeed, four members of IFITM family (IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5) have been annotated in fish genome, which display an orthologous relationship with mammalian counterparts [20]. The expression of IFITMs was induced by PolyI:C in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) [21], [22], suggesting their roles in IFN-mediated antiviral immune. However, so far there are no direct evidences whether fish IFITMs possess the ability to restrict virus infection, and how they exert the antiviral activity.",

            "text": "Emerging lines of evidence have demonstrated that IFITMs disrupt the entry step of virus infection [12], [13]. The following observations suggest that action mechanism of PoIFITM1 is similar to that of mammals. First, the virus binding and entry experiment revealed that viral particles entering into the cells to proceed replication were greatly reduced, in the presence of PoIFITM1. Second, PoIFITM1 colocalized with endocytosis marker proteins. The association between IFITM2, 3 and endocytosed transferrin has been observed in mammals, whereas IFITM1 barely exhibited colocalization with transferrin [8]. This is most likely because transferrin is a clathrin-mediated endocytic marker. Indeed, when we incubated cells with CTxB, a caveola-mediated endocytosis marker [34], an extensive colocalization was seen. Moreover, PoIFITM1 colocalized with CAV1, which is an essential component of caveolae and functions in the endocytosis [35]. IFITM1 has been suggested to interact and form a complex with CAV1 to function in some processes including endocytosis [36]. These findings indicate that PoIFITM1 associates with endocytic compartments. Finally, PoIFITM1 displayed a unique characteristic not observed in other known IFITM family members: subcellular distribution within the Golgi apparatus. The localization of IFITM proteins correlates with their antiviral function. Mammalian IFITMs have been described to reside in late endosomes or lysosome, where they prevent viruses fuse with host cell membranes, and thereby restrict virus replication [12]. Our recent studies have discovered that RGV entered FEC cells via a pH-dependent caveola-mediated endocytosis (J. Wang, R. Zhu and Q. Y. Zhang, unpublished data). In this entry route, the endocytosed virus requires access to acidic organelle to undergo viral-host membrane fusion. The Golgi complex is a potential fusion site for these viruses [37]. It raises the possibility that PoIFITM1 may target to the Golgi, and it is thus able to block viral membrane fusion process. Further investigation should be needed to elucidate the mechanism by which PoIFITM1 restricts virus infection with the Golgi targeting capability.",

(B) IFITM1 (EGFP, green) were distributed in cytoplasmic and concentrated in the perinuclear region, which was localized to Golgi (Red) but excluded from mitochondria (Mito, Red) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER, Red). Green fluorescence of the truncation (IFITM1 \u0394N) was distributed diffusely in the cells and absent from Golgi (Red), which indicated that the N-terminal region of IFITM1 was responsible for subcelluar localization. Blue fluorescence showed the nuclei stained by Hoechst 33342. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)",
