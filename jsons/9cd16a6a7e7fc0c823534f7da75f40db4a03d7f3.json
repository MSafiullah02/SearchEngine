Preventing cardiovascular diseases or cancer is much more difficult because it usually requires multiple long-term interventions requiring lifestyle changes and behavior modification, which are difficult to achieve. In 1900, the American Commission of Yellow Fever, headed by Walter Reed, was sent to Cuba. The commission showed that the infective agent was transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. This information was used by the then Surgeon General of the US Army, William Gorgas, to clean up the 200-year-old focus of yellow fever in Havana by using mosquito proofing or oiling of the larval habitat, dusting houses with pyrethrum powder, and isolating suspects under a mosquito net. This rapidly reduced the number of cases in Havana from 310 in 1900 to 18 in 1902 (Goodwin and Gordon Smith 1996) .",

The plague bacillus cannot survive long outside its animal host (humans, rodents, fleas) because it lost the ability to complete the Krebs cycle on its own. While it can only survive in its hosts, the plague bacillus also destroys its hosts rapidly. As long as susceptible hosts were abundant, plague did prosper.

The influenza virus is a single-stranded RNA virus with a lipophilic envelope. Two important glycoproteins from the envelope are the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA protein is able to agglutinate red blood cells (hence its name). This protein is important as it is a major antigen for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Antigenic drift is a minor change in surface antigens that result from point mutations in a gene segment. Antigenic drift may result in epidemics, since incomplete protection remains from past exposures to similar viruses. Antigenic shift is a major change in one or both surface antigens (H and/or N) that occurs at varying intervals. Antigenic shifts are probably due to genetic recombination (an exchange of a gene segment) between influenza type A viruses, usually those that affect humans and birds. An antigenic shift may result in a worldwide pandemic if the virus can be efficiently transmitted from person to person.",

In industrialized nations, the increase in longevity leads to higher proportion of the elderly population who are more prone to acquiring infectious diseases and developing life-threatening complications. For example, a West Nile virus (WNV) infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness (West Nile fever); rarely does it cause a severe neuroinvasive disease. In the 2002 epidemic of West Nile virus in Louisiana, the incidence of neuroinvasive disease increased progressively from 0.3 per 100,000 in the 0 to 14 age group to 9 per 100,000 in the 60-to 75-year-old age group and jumped to 32 per 100,000 in the age group 75 and older. Mortality rates showed the same pattern, a gradual increase to 0.7 per 100,000 in the 60 to 75 age group with a sudden jump to 11 per 100,000 for the oldest age group of 75 and older (Balsamo et al. 2003) . Improvement in health care in industrialized nations has caused an increase in the number of immune-deficient individuals, be it cancer survivors, transplant patients, or people on immunosuppressive drugs for long-term autoimmune diseases. Some of the conditions that may increase susceptibility to infectious diseases are cancers, particularly patients on chemo-or radiotherapy, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, immune suppression (HIV infection), long-term steroid use, liver disease, hemochromatosis, diabetes, alcoholism, chronic kidney disease, and dialysis patients. For example, persons with liver disease are 80 times more likely to develop Vibrio vulnificus infections than are persons without liver disease. Some of these infections may be severe, leading to death.",

Changes in lifestyles have increased opportunities for the transmission of infectious disease agents in populations previously at low risk. Intravascular drug injections have increased the transmission of agents present in blood and body fluids (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis B and C).

On the one hand, endogenous origin postulates that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can remain alive in the human host for a lifetime and can start multiplying and producing lesions. On the other hand, exogenous origin theory postulates that re-infection plays a role in the development of tuberculosis. The immunity provided by the initial infection is not strong enough to prevent another exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and a new infection leads to disease. In countries with low tuberculosis transmission, for example, the Netherlands, most strains have unique RFLP fingerprints. Each infection is unique, and there are hardly any clusters of infections resulting from a common source. Most cases are the result of reactivation.

It might be internal body fluids (such as cerebrospinal, pericardial, pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and amniotic fluids), and most of these exposures would occur in the medical setting. For genital fluids (vaginal, prostatic secretions, semen), sexual contact is the main mode of transmission through mucous membranes. Furthermore, transmission of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) to the newborn can occur during delivery as the newborns are exposed to vaginal secretions. Both internal and genital fluids can contain blood-borne pathogens (such as HIV, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV)). Both secretions (saliva, nasal discharge, sweat, tears, breast milk) and excretions can be infectious. Urine might be contaminated with schistosoma eggs or leptospira bacteria, and feces can contain numerous enteropathogens. Persons can be infected via sexual contact of mucosal membranes (nasal, oropharyngeal, rectal, genital) . Contact with contaminated tissue can occur in transfer of human or animal tissue: blood transfusion, blood components (factor VIII), organ transplants, or tissue grafts. Some hormones and proteins may be extracted from the tissue but still carry the infectious microorganisms, for instance, prions of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in human growth hormone extract. The rabies virus is normally transmitted through animal bites, but also human bites could potentially (however never documented) infect the bite victim with Hepatitis B or C virus. Last but not least, environmental materials such as food, water, air, or even contaminated dust play a major role in the transmission of infectious diseases.",

Droplets are generated in the upper respiratory tract during talking, singing, spitting, sneezing, and coughing. They are also produced during suctioning, sputum induction, bronchoscopy, and other respiratory procedures. The droplets produced vary in size from 1 to 100 micron (m). Droplets will fall to the floor; the speed of fall is related to droplet size (see Table 51 .2). Droplet transmission occurs by direct hit when these droplets are propelled from the infected host to the recipient's mouth, nasal mucosa, or conjunctivae. As a rule of thumb, this method of transmission is common within 3 feet of the infected patient. Inhalation of a droplet occurs also while it floats; however, this occurs only during a short period of time since the droplet is falling to the floor. Contact with surfaces contaminated with droplets is the main mode of transmission for rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV). Concentrations of rhinoviruses are much higher on the hands than in aerosols. Droplets are created by aerosolization of infectious material: The success of such aerosols reaching susceptible individuals depends on the environmental conditions: humidity, temperature of the air, air currents, and distances of the host.

The droplet nuclei must reach the pulmonary alveoli to start an infection. Large droplets are swallowed or get stuck in the trachea and bronchus; from there they are brushed back up and swallowed. The rare TB bacilli reaching the stomach are inactivated there. The role of droplet nuclei in the transmission of tuberculosis was demonstrated in several studies. In 1956, Riley and colleagues showed that air coming from rooms occupied by TB patients could infect guinea pigs (Riley et al. 1956 ). Coughing is the major producer of droplet nuclei.

Infection of an individual with HIV is followed by a flu-like syndrome. It includes fever, headache, miscellaneous aches (neck and back), malaise, lymphadenopathy, and rash. The incubation period for this primary syndrome is 2 weeks to 2 months. The patient then enters into a remission period with no clinical signs. However, during this period, the HIV multiplies at variable rates, destroying CD4+ lymphocytes which are generated as fast as they are destroyed. The latent remission ends when the patient's organism is no longer able to produce CD4+ lymphocytes in sufficient quantities. Immune defenses fail rapidly and opportunistic infections develop. This phase is considered as the AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) disease. The incubation period for AIDS diseases ranges from 2 to 10 years, with less than 10% having an incubation period greater than 10 years.",

Endemic defines the occurrence of cases of an illness with a constant frequency. Depending on the intensity of the occurrence, the terms holoendemic, hyperendemic, or hypoendemic are used. Epidemic is defined as the occurrence in a community of cases of an illness with a frequency clearly in excess of normal expectancy. If this occurrence of an epidemic occurs worldwide or affects numerous countries, epidemiologists consider it a pandemic. The most recent pandemic was declared in June 2009, when the WHO declared a pandemic of novel influenza A (H1N1). At the time, more than 70 countries had reported cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection, and there were ongoing community level outbreaks of novel H1N1 in multiple parts of the world. An outbreak is defined as two or more related cases with the identical infectious disease agent suggesting the possibility of a common source or transmission between these cases. It also could be defined as a very limited epidemic; however, the word \"epidemic\" is usually avoided when the number of cases is relatively small so as not to scare the public. Elimination of disease is the reduction to zero of the disease incidence in a defined geographical area (e.g., neonatal tetanus) compared to the elimination of infections which is defined as the reduction to zero of incidence of infection in a defined geographical area (e.g., measles, poliomyelitis).

Preexisting level of immunity to the disease, the nutritional status of the host, as well as any preexisting disease will influence a successful transmission as well. Individuals with impaired immune response (HIV, patients on immunosuppressive therapy for cancer or transplant) have a higher risk of developing severe disease. Also personal habits or lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking alcohol, drug abuse, or exercise can influence the host response. Smoking depresses the ciliary function of the bronchial tree and increases susceptibility to infections (e.g., tuberculosis). Alcohol consumption increases the risk for chronic Hepatitis infections.

In general, a law requires that health facility staff, particularly physicians and laboratories, report these conditions with guaranteed confidentiality. It is also useful to have other non-health-related entities report suspected communicable diseases such as day-care centers, schools, restaurants, long-term care facilities, summer camps, and resorts. Regulations on mandatory reporting are often difficult to enforce. Voluntary compliance by the institution's personnel is necessary. Reporting may be done in writing, by phone, or electronically in the most advanced system. Since most infectious diseases are confirmed by a laboratory test, reporting by the laboratory may be more reliable. The advantage of laboratory reporting is the ability to computerize the reporting system. Computer programs may be set up to automatically report a defined set of tests and results. For some infectious diseases, only clinical diagnoses are made. These syndromes may be the consequences of a large number of different microorganisms for which laboratory confirmation is impractical.",

There is a continuous process leading to an infectious disease: exposed, colonized, incubating, sick, clinical form, convalescing, and cured. Even among those who have overt disease, there are several disease stages that may not be included in a surveillance system: Cases reported Cases diagnosed but not reported Cases who seek medical attention but were not diagnosed Cases who were symptomatic but did not seek medical attention Cases who were not symptomatic Infectious disease cases play different roles in the epidemiology of an infectious disease; some individuals are the indicators (most symptomatic), some are the reservoir of microorganisms (usually asymptomatic, not very sick), some are amplifiers (responsible for most of the transmission), and some are the victims (those who develop severe long-term complications). Depending on the specific disease and the purpose of the surveillance program, different disease stages should be reported.

For example, WNV cases are normally mapped by residency but do not take into account that people might have been exposed or bitten by an infective mosquito far away from where they live. For outbreak investigations, spot maps are usually more useful than rate maps or maps of aggregate data. Depending on the outbreak, it might be useful to characterize the outbreak by persons' demographics such as age, sex, address, occupation, and health status. Are the cases at increased susceptibility or at high risk of infection? These kinds of variables might give the investigator a good idea if the exposure is not yet known.

A fourfold increase of positivity (e.g., from a 1:16 to 1:64 dilution) over a 2-week period was usually considered confirmatory based on the dilution factor that meets the criteria for positivity in the laboratory test. A good example for this is Brucella sp.

            "text": "Mathematical models are an important tool for understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. In contrast to statistical models, dynamic transmission models are based on first principles. They aim at deriving population level phenomena from a mechanistic description of transmission between individuals of the population. The centerpiece of a dynamic transmission model consists of a term that quantifies the rate with which susceptible and infectious persons have contact with each other and the probability that transmission takes place during such a contact. In its simplest form, this term is modeled as a mass action term. In analogy to the mass action law in chemistry, the underlying assumption is that susceptible and infectious persons mix homogeneously and contact each other with a rate that is proportional to the concentrations of either population group. In more formal terms, if we denote by X.t/ the fraction of susceptible persons, and by Y.t/ the fraction of infected and infectious persons at time t, the rate at which infectious contacts take place is proportional to X.t/ Y.t/. The proportionality factor\u02c7is a product of the contact rate -the number of contacts per unit timeand the probability that upon contact transmission of infection takes place. With the assumption that recovery from the infectious state into the immune state occurs with a constant rate , we can now formulate a first simple mathematical model: where Z.t/ is the fraction of immune or recovered individuals at time t. This set of equations is the simplest version of the so-called susceptible-infectedremoved model that was first introduced in a more elaborate form by Kermack and McKendrick (1927; reprinted 1991) . Since then, numerous variants of this simple model have been formulated and analyzed (Anderson and May 1991) . The primary aim of such a model is to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the system. For example, in the above system of equations, we are interested in how an outbreak evolves in the population after introduction of a small number of index cases. The epidemic curve will depend on the parameters of the model, which in this case are the transmission rate\u02c7and the recovery rate . Let us see what we can say by just looking at the equations. Let us assume that we start at t D 0 in a situation where almost the entire population is susceptible, a small fraction of the population is infected, and nobody is immune. First, we observe that the fraction of susceptibles in the population can only decrease, because the righthand side of the equation for X.t/ is negative. Furthermore, we see that Y.t/ will increase if the right-hand side of the equation for Y.t/ is positive, which is the case if\u02c7X.0/Y .0/ > Y .0/. This leads to the insight that an outbreak is only possible if = > 1. Here\u02c7= is the so-called basic reproduction number denoted by R 0 (see also Sect. 51.12.2). We will come back to this important concept later. Finally, we see that the fraction of immune persons in the population is continuously increasing as long as there are infected persons in the population. Figure 51 .12 shows the typical time course of an outbreak for the parameters\u02c7D 5 and D 1. After the outbreak has swept through the population and has left a certain fraction of the population immune, no further dynamics are possible in this system. This can only change if new susceptible individuals enter the population.",

In other words, the basic reproduction number is given by the product of the transmission rate (number of new infections per time unit) and the duration of the infectious period. In the above model, the number of new infections per unit time is given by\u02c7, while the duration of the infectious period can be computed as 1=. C /.

This is the so-called threshold property that was already in 1927 formulated by Kermack and McKendrick (reprinted 1991) in a more general form. If R 0 > 1 an infected individual replaces himself by more than 1 new infected persons, which leads to an expansion of the epidemic. If R 0 < 1 the infection cannot establish itself in the population and will die out. In more generality, one talks about the reproduction number R.t/ that describes the number of secondary cases per infected individual in a population that is not necessarily completely susceptible. R.t/ depends on the time, because with unfolding of the epidemic outbreak, the proportion of susceptibles in the population decreases and the proportion of immune individuals increases. Therefore, R.t/ will decrease with time. If there is no replenishment of the susceptible population, the transmission will stop at some point. The total number or fraction of the population that was infected during the entire course of the outbreak is called the final size of the epidemic. In epidemiological terms, the final size is called the attack rate; we denote it by A. The final size can be expressed in terms of the basic reproduction number as A D 1 exp. R 0 A/ (Fig. 51.13 ).",

This started to change with the advent of the HIV pandemic, when mathematical models were first used to predict future epidemic spread, and to analyze the impact of behavior change on HIV incidence (Kaplan and Brandeau 1994) . However, the breakthrough for mathematical modeling as a public health tool came with the concerns that smallpox virus could be used in a deliberate release and lead to devastating outbreaks in the only partially immune populations of present societies. How can public health policy be developed against threats with pathogens that are not circulating at present? There is no way to conduct epidemiological investigations, and the only available data in the case of smallpox were from before the eradication era. Therefore, to design policy, knowledge from historical smallpox outbreaks had to be combined with data about present-day society, and possible interventions had to be tested on the basis of this available information. Mathematical modeling provided a flexible tool to do that and was used to analyze possible vaccination strategies and other interventions (Ferguson et al. 2003) .",

This rate can be calculated as number of nosocomial infections 100 number of patients admitted :Hospital-Wide Patient Infection Rate per 100 Admissions Hospital-wide patient infection rate/100 admissions are used to avoid the pitfall of multiple infections in the same patient. This rate may be calculated for a given period: month, quarter, and year. In this rate, a patient with two infections is counted only once:Patient Infection Rate per 1,000 Hospital Days The risks of infections are much higher in some units of the hospital such as intensive care units (ICUs) and coronary care units. Calculating ward-specific rates is useful to look at the trends in specific units or compare between units. The number of patients admitted to an ICU may be difficult to determine because some patients are admitted in the ward 1 day, spend a few days, be discharged to a regular ward, and after a few days be readmitted into ICU. To avoid the problem posed by the same patient admitted and discharged several times from the ICU to the wards, the rate of infection is expressed in number of patients infected/1,000 hospital days. This rate also takes into account the duration of hospitalization which is a risk factor for nosocomial infection. It allows comparison between wards where duration is different and can be calculated as number of infections 100 number of hospital days :Device-Specific Rates and Procedure-Specific RatesThe risk of infection is related to the extrinsic risk factors (use of devices such as ventilator, central line intravascular catheter, urinary catheter, surgical operation). To compare the risk associated with these devices or procedures, the following rates are best suited: surgical site infection rate D number of surgical site infections 100 number of patients operated on ; ventilator associated pneumonia rate D number of ventilator associated pneumonia 1;000 number of patients on ventilator days ; catheter related bloodstream infection (BSI) rate D number of catheter related BSI 100 number of patients on IV line days ;",

Surveillance should provide systematic and continuous observations on the occurrence and distribution of nosocomial infections within the hospital population. Surveillance is the focal point for infection control activities. The term surveillance implies that the observational data are regularly analyzed.Surveillance activities may provide valuable epidemiological data such as the identification of outbreaks, priorities for infection control activities, and the elucidation of important secular trends, such as shifts in microbial pathogens, infection rates, or outcomes of hospital-acquired infection. Surveillance activities provide the additional benefits of increasing the visibility of the infection control team in the hospital during the infection control practitioners' ward rounds and of allowing an opportunity for informal consultation and education for both nurses and physicians.Ideally, the surveillance of hospital-acquired infection should be a continuous process that consists of the following elements: 1. Definition of categories of infection 2. Systematic case finding and data collection 3. Tabulation of data 4. Analysis and interpretation of data 5. Reporting of relevant infection surveillance data to individuals and groups for appropriate action",
