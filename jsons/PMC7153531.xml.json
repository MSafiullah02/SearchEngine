            "text": "Metastases are the main cause of cancer-related deaths; however, the mechanisms underlying metastatic spread are not completely understood. It is a complicated, multistep process that requires detachment of cancer cells from the primary tumour, intravasation into the bloodstream, the survival of tumour cells and tumour clusters in the bloodstream, and finally extravasation to distant organs [1]. Besides circulating tumour cells, tumour clusters seem to play a key role in the metastatic process [2]. In 1954, Watanabe showed that these clustered cells have high metastatic potential [3]. More recent studies indicated that clusters have distinct features compared to single tumour cells, including phenotype, gene expression signature, and dissemination mode. Thus, establishing the role and significance of circulating tumour cell clusters in the spread of cancer is of extreme importance. Circulating tumour cell clusters are defined as a group of more than two or three tumour cells with strong cell\u2013cell contacts moving in the blood circulation and in the lymphatic system. They are rare, but highly metastatic. Despite representing only 2\u20135% of all circulating tumour cells, clusters were shown to form about 50 % of breast cancer metastases, and their metastatic potential was estimated to be 23\u201350 times higher than that of single cells [4]. Circulating tumour cell clusters represent a conglomerate of tumour cells and other types of cells including platelets, immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. It seems that tumour clusters are epithelial-mesenchymal hybrids and therefore possess enormous plasticity [5]. This composition provides a local microenvironment that is thought to protect tumour clusters from death in the circulation by minimising shear stress and immune attack, and facilitating colonisation [6]. Au et al. have shown that clusters can actually traverse capillary-sized vessels [7]. It appears that upon constriction, tumour cell clusters undergo rapid reorganisation, forming a chain-like structure that reduces hydrodynamic resistance and allows them to pass through a small vessel. As concequence, the tumor cluster chains move preferentially parallel oriented to the vessel axis to maintain the lowest hydrodynamic resistance. This reorganisation was shown to be reversible, since after exiting constriction, clusters rearrange into their typical organisations. Aceto et al. [4] have demonstrated that the invasive potential of tumour clusters is higher than that of single tumour cells. Cheung et al. obtained similar results and estimated that approximately 97 % of metastases arise from clusters [8]. Other data suggested that intravascular aggregation and proliferation could be excluded as potential sources of tumour clusters due to the unfavourable conditions present in the bloodstream [9]. Very recently, Gkountela et al. [10] demonstrated that - in strong contrast to circulating tumour cells - the pattern of transcription factors in tumour clusters reveals similarities to embryonic stem cells along with increased proliferation. However, some cluster processes are still unknown regarding their genesis,transit and settlement and about the precise cellular and molecular mechanism. Nevertheless, the clinical data so far indicate the prognostic value of CTC cluster analysis in predicting treatment resistance and survival outcomes in cancer patients. [16]",

Tumour clusters thus may serve as indicators for the formation and existence of primary tumours, and conversely, they may also serve as indicators for complete or incomplete removal of primary tumours [4], as long metastases have not been formed. Cancer metastases arise mainly from circulating tumour cell clusters. Therefore, they should be the most important targets for metastasis prevention and reduction [8].The existing liquid biopsy methods of circulating tumour cell detection, like Cell Search [12], cannot be applied as reference for tumour cluster enumeration because they do not preserve their morphological and molecular status and are sensitive only for epithelial cells. Clearance rates of the labeled clusters and single CTCs from the bloodstream were established in mouse experiments by in vivo flow cytometry [7]. A photoacoustic in vivo method for circulating melanoma tumor cell cluster detection is described in [15].",

            "text": "There is no gold-standard method of detecting tumour clusters that enables a comparison of results obtained by different methods. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a standardised method for isolating and detecting circulating tumour clusters [2]. Photodiagnostic Infrared Spectroscopy (PDIS) is based on photodynamic physics, which was discovered and described for the first time by Jablonski in 1933 [11]. Photodynamic excitation is a physical principle that is explained in the Jablonski Diagram. The most important characteristic feature of a photodynamic process in general, and with liposomal indocyanine green (ICG) as a photosensitiser in particular, is the simultaneous emission of fluorescence and phosphorescence radiation. This is a kind of \u201cfingerprint\u201d and proves without a doubt the photodynamic origin of the signals. Therefore, in spectroscopic peak analyses, photon peaks generated by the environment can be clearly distinguished from photon peaks generated by a photodynamic process. The internal conversion of photon energy to heat can be neglected, it does not influence the detected signature of the signals. The amount of heat is very low due to the low excitation energies of about 10 mW/cm2 and the low concentration of ICG. We have used ICG as a specific liposomal formulation, which has an absorption wavelength of 785 nm, a fluorescence wavelength of 830 nm, and a phosphorescence wavelength of 940 nm, as reported by B\u00e4umler et al. [13]. The advantage of liposomal ICG compared to normal ICG, which is used in angiography, is the much higher lifetime of liposomal ICG in blood and tissue (\u223c 36 h) compared to normal ICG (\u223c 10 min). After intravenous injection, normal ICG binds within 1\u22122 sec almost completely (98 %) to serum proteins, therefore an accumulation in peripheral tissue or organs or even tumors is practically impossible.",

The optical fibre detector is coupled to the high resolution-spectrometer. The whole assembly is placed in a clean-room box, maintained for measurements at a constant temperature of 37 \u00b0C and kept under dark conditions during measurement. The upper reservoir, with a volume of 500 mL cell nutrition solution, contains a port for cancer cell injection and a port for the optical fibre lead through. At the bottom of the upper reservoir, a flexible silicon tube is arranged that connects the upper and the lower cell nutrition reservoirs. The cell nutrition solution flows in the flexible silicon tube from the upper to the lower reservoir. A valve on the lower reservoir is used to set the flow speed; in all experiments, the flow speed was kept constant at 10 cm/s. At the end of the optical fibre detector, an external laser source, emitting at 785 nm, is placed to generate an infrared light field within the silicon tube. When an ICG-incubated tumour cell or tumour cluster flows through the light field, fluorescence radiation at 830 nm and phosphorescence radiation are emitted and guided via optical fibre to the spectrometer. After 4 h incubation in 15 \u03bcM ICG solution, the cells, which were plated in a 6-well tissue culture plate at a concentration of 10 cells/well, were injected into the upper nutrition reservoir. The ICG uptake of MDA-231 cancer cell clusters was studied by haematological investigation using Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM). CLSM images were acquired by a VisiScope (Visitron Systems, Germany). Liposomal ICG was purchased from Burg-Apotheke, Koenigstein, Germany; the spectroscopic device was a C9505CB with a detection range from 400 nm to 1100 nm, produced by Hamamatsu Ltd, Hamamatsu, Japan. The laser catheter was purchased from Webermedical GmbH (Lauenfoerde,Germany); the numerical aperture was 0.3.

In contrast, human leukocytes exposed to 15 \u03bcM ICG solution did not show any photosensitiser accumulation [14]. Fig. 2 shows clearly that liposomal ICG was accumulated in breast tumour cells and clusters at diagnostic concentrations of 15 \u03bcM. Hence, the prerequisite for photodiagnostic excitation of the breast cancer cells, as well for diagnostics for therapy, is fulfilled in light of these results. Our haematologic investigations with normal human leukocyte cells have shown that these cells do not accumulate liposomal ICG at concentrations of 15 \u03bcM. [14] Therefore, there are two components in the bloodstream which emit 830 nm fluorescence: on the one hand, there is the infused liposomal ICG, which is to 98 % bound to plasma proteins such as albumin and which forms a constant, continuous fluorescence radiation background. On the other hand, there are the low numbers of circulating breast tumour cells and tumour clusters, which have accumulated the liposomal ICG and which supply discrete fluorescence signals upon excitation. This is how it is possible to unambiguously distinguish the continuous background from the discrete tumour cluster peaks in PDIS blood screening. Before starting the PDIS blood screening, a\u201d reference\u201d light intensity is measured within 10\u22123 s. This reference spectrum is permanently subtracted from each \u201cverum\u201d spectrum (every 10-3 s) measured during the screening cycle of 10 3 s duration.

After passing the laser spot, the single clusters werer filtered out by a microcavity array filter and investigated by CSLM, to correlate the cluster morphology and the corresponding cluster fluorescence. When passing the 785 nm laser, the ICG-incubated cancer cells emitted 830 nm fluorescence peaks, which were guided to the spectrometer via optical laser catheter. The DMEM nutrition solutions used here were optically inert. The spectroscopic background radiation was compensated for with a special subtracting software, as described above, so that the starting intensity was always near the zero-fluorescence intensity value. The advantage is that only the photons emitted from the moving tumour clusters are displayed above the spectral noise. The flow speed was held constant at 10 cm/s, which is close to the blood flow velocity in the peripheral vena basilica, which has always been used in clinical PDIS screenings. Fig. 3(A) shows that as long the moving breast cancer cell is outside the light field, only small intensity fluctuations (statistical noise) near the zero-intensity line are recorded. If the cancer cell is directly in front of the optical fibre window, the intensity of the fluorescence steeply increases from zero to a maximum of about 2300 counts. When the cancer cell is leaving the light field, the intensity I f(d) decreases exponentially, according to the formula 1/d\u00b2 (where d = distance).The FWHM of the peak is of about 0.5 s +/- 0.2 s, in accordance with the flow speed of 10 cm/s. From a moving object, we have to expect an exponential decay of the fluorescence intensity according to the distance law if the object is leaving the light field. This is exactly what the peak in Fig. 3(A) confirms.

However, we have never detected tumour clusters in the blood of healthy probands. The investigations of Aceto et al. [4] and Cheung et al. [8] have demonstrated that circulating tumour clusters are always formed in tumours and cannot be formed in vessels by aggregation. Therefore, tumour clusters seem to be appropriate indicators or precursors of the existence of a primary, solid tumour, and conversely, are appropriate indicators of the complete or incomplete destruction of primary tumours. When tumour clusters appear in the bloodstream after breast cancer treatments like surgery or chemotherapy, the primary tumour has not been completely removed. PDIS allows physicians to control the dissolution of circulating tumour clusters and to maintain careful control over the presence of tumour clusters in the blood. The use of PDIS blood screening after finishing chemotherapy makes it possible to provide patients with calibration-based information about their status, thereby reducing psychological stress, fear, and uncertainty, which are all consequences of the current \"wait and hope\" principle.",

A PDIS blood screening can be performed and analyzed within 45 min. PDIS diagnostics allows for the verification of the results of surgery and chemotherapy, and for the targeting of treatment strategies for circulating tumour cluster dissolution to keep the blood of cancer patients free from tumour clusters and cells, and consequently, to prevent metastasis formation and to improve the overall survival. The PDIS method can be applied also for corona virus detection and destruction using Riboflavin as photosensitizer.",
