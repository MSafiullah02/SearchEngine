The virion proteins are synthesized from monocistronic mRNA species analogous to those of Ebola virus (7).

The lectins used were conjugated to the steroid hapten digoxigenin (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), and their binding was assayed by immunoblotting. The results obtained with peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA) are shown in Fig. 2 . As indicated by control experiments with fetuin that contains N-and O-linked oligosaccharides and with asialofetuin containing the same glycans devoid of sialic acid, PNA reacts specifically with the galactose-/3( l -3)-N-acetylgalactosamine cores of 0-glycans that must not be substituted with terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid. The observation that Marburg virus GP is recognized by PNA after incubation with endoglycosidase F or N-glycopeptidase F provides further support for the presence of 0-glycans. It was unexpected, however, that PNA bound also to GP after incubation with endo-a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. This suggests that galactose-p(l-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine cores substituted with nonsialic acid residues of 20 &i/ml, and labeled virus was harvested 24 hr thereafter.

The sedimentation coefficients of monomeric and trimeric GP were approximately 5 and 11 S, respectively, relative to trimerit influenza virus (FPV) hemagglutinin (8.8 S). GP trimers have thus a higher sedimentation coefficient than hemagglutinin trimers, and this is in agreement with the higher molecular weight of GP. Figure 4B shows also that the other viral proteins cosedimented under nonreducing conditions with GP monomers, and that fractions 5-l 1 containing GP complexes were free of other viral proteins.",

GP resembles therefore in its quaternary structure the hemagglutinin of influenza virus and the G protein of VSV which form also trimers. Our data show also that GP contains not only N-glycans of the complex and the oligomannosidic type, but also carbohydrate side chains in 0-glycosidic linkages. The latter ones contain the core unit galactose-/-I(l-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine and therefore belong to the 0-glycans of the mucin type. Whereas A/-glycans are very common with enveloped viruses, O-linked carbohydrate side chains have been detected so far only in a few viral glycoproteins. These are, on the one hand, the El glycoprotein of bovine and murine coronaviruses that contain only Oglycans (8-10) and, on the other hand, herpes virus glycoproteins",
