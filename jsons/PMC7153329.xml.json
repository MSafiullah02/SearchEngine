            "text": "In the case of viral meningitis due to coronavirus infection, meningeal endothelial cells and fibroblastic reticular cells release chemokines such as C\u2013C motif ligands (CCLs) 19 and 21 and reactivate antiviral C\u2013C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), CD4, and CD8 T cells in response to resident myeloid and neural cell infection. The entry of CCR7 T cells is aided by stromal cell reorganization after infection. Chemokines are the proteins responsible for stimulating the recruitment of WBCs (leukocytes). The peculiarity for chemokines is that they are low-molecular-weight proteins. They are secondary proinflammatory mediators induced by primary proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Specificity is one of the most important criteria for chemokines.",

They play a critical role in the directed movement of leukocytes from the bloodstream into tissue as well as localization of cells within tissues. These molecules act as extracellular messengers for the immune system. However, emerging data also show that various members of the chemokine gene superfamily exert a range of biological effects beyond chemotaxis including angiogenesis and hematopoiesis. All nucleated cells and tissues examined to date are capable of expressing at least some chemokines, and it seems likely that by the time all chemokines in the genome have been identified and all their biological functions elucidated, we will find that as a family, these molecules perform vital roles in all tissues of the body.",

            "text": "Gene products are assigned to the chemokine gene superfamily according to the organization of a characteristic cysteine signature in their predicted primary amino acid structure. Based on this cysteine motif, the various members can be subdivided into four families (two major and two minor) known interchangeably as either (1) CXC, CC, C, and CX3C, or (2) \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4. CXC chemokines can be further subdivided into glutamic acid/leucine/arginine (ELR)-containing and non-ELR-containing chemokines depending on the presence of an ELR motif just prior to the CXC signature. ELR-containing C\u2013X\u2013C chemokines attract neutrophils, whereas non-ELR-containing C-X-C chemokines attract lymphocytes. Recently, a new member of the CXC subfamily was identified. This chemokine, known as CXCL16, is unique among CXC chemokines in that it is significantly larger than the others (the CXCL16 gene encodes a 249-amino acid peptide) and is predicted to contain a mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail with a six-cysteine-containing 88-amino acid chemokine module at the N-terminus. The second major branch of CC chemokines are chemoattractants for a wide range of cells including monocytes, granulocytes other than neutrophils, various subpopulations of lymphocytes including thymocytes, and DCs. The CC subfamily contains the largest number of chemokines. The only C chemokine cloned to date, XCL1/lymphotactin, has been reported to selectively attract CD8+T lymphocytes. This chemokine has only two cysteines in its primary amino acid sequence. Finally, CX3CL1/fractalkine, the only member of the CX3C subfamily, has a unique primary amino acid sequence with three intervening amino acids between its first two cysteines. Like CXCL16, it is an unusual chemokine in that it is also a large protein with a chemokine module positioned at the N-terminus and is predicted to comprise a mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail.",
