Proper identification of risk factors for the CFR may explain this striking difference. However, there has never been a report using the overall data of Chinese cases to describe and analyse the CFR.

In addition, it was difficult to predict the risk of death for SARS patients because of the limited data based on individual regions and without taking the overall epidemic in mainland China into consideration. The previous publications were further limited; in that, some important parameters (e.g. period of the epidemic) were not included and often only univariate regression analysis was performed on the data (Chen et al. 2005 ).

This was amplified by the relatively higher number of old people who contracted SARS in the hospital while suffering from life-threatening other morbidity.

Our large database also suggests that gender does not play an important role. The initial higher risk of dying among males was reversed into a borderline statistically significant higher risk for females after correction for other factors. Still, if anything, the risk for females is only slightly higher than for males (OR = 0.83). Healthcare workers were major victims during the SARS epidemic.

In our study of mainland China, HCWs also showed a much lower CFR than non-HCWs (3.3% vs. 6-10%).

The high CFR in Tianjin may be due to the special situation that 120 out of 175 cases (68.6%) were hospital inpatients (Wang et al. 2003a ). This percentage is unknown for other areas in China, but the proportion of HCW cases among all SARS cases in Tianjin is also much higher than for other areas (39% vs. 19%), also illustrating the high rate of nosocomial infection in this city.

Consequently, the proportion of individuals at higher risk of dying (i.e. those of 50 years and above) is also higher in these areas. Using the age-related CFR values of mainland China (as resulted from our study) for the age distributions of SARS cases in Hong Kong and Canada resulted in an expected overall CFR of about 9.2% (data not shown). This is indeed higher than the overall value in mainland China (6.4%), but still much lower than the actual values of 17.2% and 17.1% in Hong Kong and Canada, respectively.
