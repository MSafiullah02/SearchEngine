Presence of adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1-3, and respiratory syncytial virus was defined by positive PCR on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens or a 4-fold rise in paired serology. We performed multiple imputation by developing a multivariable regression model for each virus using data from patients with available serology results.

            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of hospitalization in the United States [1, 2] . Bacterial and viral pathogens can cause pneumonia and can be detected using a broad range of diagnostic tests. However, there is no true \"gold standard\" for etiology determination, because currently available diagnostic tests for respiratory pathogens have well known limitations [3] [4] [5] . Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are most commonly performed on respiratory specimens in etiology studies, because they have improved sensitivity and turnaround time for respiratory virus detection relative to culture [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Although not timely, serology may capture infections even if a virus is not sufficiently present to be detected by PCR in respiratory specimens; thus, acute and convalescent (paired sera) serology results can increase the diagnostic yield for respiratory viruses in CAP studies [3, 4, [11] [12] [13] . However, even in the research setting, paired sera are not always available from each patient, particularly because convalescent serology requires specimen collection posthospital discharge or death. Multiple imputation, an analytic method used to assign values for missing data, can be applied to pneumonia etiology studies when test results are missing. We applied multiple imputation to missing serology results to improve estimates of respiratory virus detection in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, a multicenter active surveillance study of the incidence and etiology of CAP among hospitalized US adults and children [14, 15] .",

We performed multiple imputation to calculate missing values for AdV, HMPV, influenza, PIV, and RSV serology tests (the viruses for which both PCR and serology tests were performed). Multiple imputation uses a multivariable regression model [16] [17] [18] that is fit using data from patients for whom the outcome (serology result) is available, to impute a value for patients whose result is missing; this method may be useful when patients had a negative PCR result for a given virus but had a missing serology result. Multiple imputation is based on the assumption that serology results are missing at random [16, 17] . We assessed the assumption of data missing at random by comparing demographic and clinical characteristics among patients with and without available serology results using \u03c7 2 or Fisher's exact tests, considering statistical significance (P < .05). To create the multivariable logistic regression model used for imputation, among patients with available serology results, we first determined which variables were significantly associated with positive serology results in bivariate analyses. Second, we constructed \"a priori\" models with positive serology as the outcome using age (ordinal variable), sex, any bacterial detection, and the corresponding viral PCR result as predictors (Supplementary Data). We also considered age as a categorical variable, which did not meaningfully change our results. Third, we identified which of the variables that were significant in bivariate analyses remained significant when added to the multivariable a priori model. Variables considered included symptoms, underlying medical conditions, radiographic findings, intensive care unit admission, and influenza season (Supplementary Data). Fourth, we used the area under the curve (AUC) to determine whether we would include a variable in the final regression model: the variable was included in the final model only if the AUC was higher for the a priori model when the variable was added to the model compared with the model without that variable. The AUC ranged from 0.5 to 1, with higher values indicating better discrimination of the model at predicting patients with positive versus negative serology results. In addition, we evaluated model fit using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (models with P < .05 were rejected). Separate models were constructed for children and adults for each virus. Twenty imputed datasets were created for improved efficiency [19] and pooled (Supplementary Data).",

No additional variables were significant for positive AdV and HMPV serology results; thus, the a priori model was used to impute serology results for these viruses. For PIV, wheezing was not significant in the a priori model so the a priori model was used to impute serology results. Abdominal pain remained significant in the multivariable a priori model for influenza, as did wheezing for RSV ( Table 5 ).

The absolute and relative increases found in the viral-specific detections with multiple imputation were modest among both children and adults. It is notable that the largest absolute increase was for influenza among children (4.4%), and the largest relative increase was for AdV among adults (3-fold); however, the CI for this imputed AdV estimate was wide. The reasons for the differences in the multiple imputation results compared with observed results are likely multifactorial. Serology has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield for AdV, HMPV, PIV, and RSV by 3.0%-86.7% [11, 12, 22] and for influenza viruses by 15%-130% [3, 4, 11, 12] when compared with PCR across all ages. The diagnostic yield of one method versus another may differ by age, because we observed in the EPIC study that the diagnostic yields for AdV, HMPV, PIV, and RSV were 11.8%-48.9% among children and adults [22] . These differences indicate that serology increases diagnostic yield for most viruses but differs by specific virus and age of the patient. In addition, serology may capture detections missed by PCR because of late collection of NP/OP specimens relative to illness onset, inadequate sample collection or preservation, or collection of an NP/OP specimen before onset of viral shedding.",

However, we did not observe a meaningful change in the virus-specific prevalence when excluding patients for whom NP/OP specimens were collected after 7 days from illness onset (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4) . Ultimately, the increases in virus-specific proportions were due to the increase in serologic detections estimated through multiple imputation. For patients who had a positive PCR result and missing serology, imputing missing serology would not have increased the virus-specific proportion because the positive PCR result would have already contributed to the proportion. Thus, an increase in virus-specific proportion would have been observed only if an observed PCR result is negative and an imputed serology result is positive. Our analysis quantified these increases in virus-specific detections by using multiple imputation, demonstrating the utility of this method when data are missing.",

Although we observed differences between patients with and without available serology results, it does not necessarily indicate a major violation of the assumption. Systematic differences can occur between patients with and without missing data even when data are missing at random; these differences can be explained by other observed variables [23] .

Second, estimates from multiple imputation were sensitive to the independent variables used and the strength of their association with serology results among patients with available data. This concern may be minimal because we used the viral PCR result as an independent variable, which was a strong predictor of the paired serology result. Third, although not a limitation of this analysis, the detection of viruses in NP/OP swabs is not necessarily indicative of the cause of CAP [27, 28] and may represent (1) resolving infection rather than acute infection or (2) an infection limited to the upper tract and not lower tract [29] . Similarly, paired serology could represent an interval infection that occurred after the initial presentation or hospitalization and may not be indicative of the cause of the CAP hospitalization; thus, including viral serology results in any analysis could overestimate the true viral burden of CAP. Fourth, we combined influenza A and B viruses together and parainfluenza types 1-3 together, although the predictors of positive serology results may differ by each virus's type. Finally, illness onset was self-or caregiver-reported, which introduces potential recall bias. However, our sensitivity analyses indicated that virus-specific prevalence estimates did not change significantly when excluding patients who had NP/OP swabs collected after 7 days from illness onset.",
