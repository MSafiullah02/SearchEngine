The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and owed to very high contagiosity has quickly spread globally, thus on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized it as pandemic. Obviously, COVID-19 represents the largest acute health challenge for the society in the modern history of mankind. According to the WHO report (March 6, 2020), the crude mortality ratio (reported deaths divided by reported cases) is 3-4%, whereas these rates vary by country, patient age, and presence of co-morbidities. Most of those who have died were elderly (about 80% of deaths were in those aged 60 and more), and 75% of them had pre-existing health problems, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted from human to human, and symptomatic individuals are the most frequent source of the disease. As with other respiratory pathogens, including flu and rhinovirus, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to occur through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. Primarily, the transmission of disease is facilitated when people are in close contact, but it may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface and then their face. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the COVID-19 are only supportive, and reducing transmission in the community is the only one effective preventive measure, which presumes isolation of patients and infected individuals and careful infection control.",

It was demonstrated that Zn deficiency is associated with reduced antibody production, affected function of the innate immune system (e.g., low natural killer cell activity), decreased cytokine production by monocytes, and the chemotaxis and oxidative burst of neutrophil granulocytes [3]. It also results in thymic atrophy, altered thymic hormones production, lymphopenia, and defective cellular- and antibody-mediated responses that lead to increased rates and duration of infection. In particular, Zn deficiency reduces the number of peripheral and thymic T cells, their proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin, and the functions of T helpers and cytotoxic T cells. In addition, Zn deficiency acts indirectly by reducing the levels of active serum thymulin, a zinc-dependent nonapeptide hormone that regulates the differentiation of immature T cells in the thymus and the function of mature peripheral T cells [4]. On the other hand, Zn can affect several aspects of monocyte signal transduction and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and interfere with the binding of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 to ICAM-1, thus suppressing inflammatory reaction [5].HypothesisZn supplementation may be of potential benefit for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19, since it possesses a variety of direct and indirect antiviral properties, which are realized through different mechanisms.\n",

In healthy humans, Zn supplementation has also decreased the production of TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 [6]. Zn also enhances cell\u2019s resistance to apoptosis through inhibition of caspases-3, -6, and -9, and an increase of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio [7], and such antiapoptotic effects at both the peripheral and thymic level could result in an increase in the number of T helpers. Zn-induced alteration of the capillary epithelium might inhibit transcapillary movement of plasma proteins and reduce local edema, inflammation, exudation, and mucus secretion [8]. Finally, Zn may also protect or stabilize the cell membrane which could contribute to an inhibition of the entry of the virus into the cell [9].",

Zn effectively inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of nidoviruses (including SARS-CoV) in vitro, which is realized through alteration of RdRp activity during the elongation phase of RNA synthesis, probably by directly affecting template binding [24]. Such an effect could be reversed by addition of a Zn2+ chelator (MgEDTA). Thus, it may be suggested that in coronaviruses, Zn2+ may inhibit both the proper proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and RdRp activity [24].",

Multiple antiviral effects of Zn have been demonstrated in a variety of viral species, including several nidoviruses, for which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. It suggests that zinc supplementation may be of benefit for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Considering current absence of effective therapies for this disease, its high contagiosity, frequent life-threating course, and tremendous negative impact on the affected individuals and healthcare systems worldwide, the presented hypothesis requires urgent testing in humans.",
