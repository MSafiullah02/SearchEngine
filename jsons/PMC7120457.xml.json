During coughing and sneezing, particles of mucus can be expelled for a distance of up to 9 m [1]. Various pathogens, if present, may therefore infect nearby people and animals, contributing to massive dissemination of airborne infections. In addition to using various protective measures, down-regulation of coughing plays a substantial role in preventing dissemination of respiratory infections. For example, about 80 % of passengers on a 3-h airplane trip may be infected by the cough of an individual carrying the flu virus. These newly infected passengers then disseminate the viral infection at their destinations worldwide.",

In cats, rapid inspiratory efforts can be evoked by nasopharyngeal stimulation, manifesting as the sniff- and gasp-like aspiration reflex (AspR) [1, 6\u20138] and by rapid lung inflation [5], which decreases the frequency and intensity of the subsequent expiratory efforts of cough and postpones them [9]. During gastroesophageal reflux or inhalation of irritant substances to the larynx, there is a strong \u201curge to cough\u201d that can be voluntarily suppressed. To prevent aspiration of irritant substances into the lower airways, the necessary effort of coughing may be postponed by a previous, very slow voluntary inspiration followed by breath-holding and swallowing of the bolus to the esophagus. Only then can the effort to cough be initiated for expulsion of irritants from the airways [10\u201312]. Similar voluntary cough suppression commonly decreases the disturbing effect of coughing during a concert. It can similarly strongly inhibit dissemination of airborne infections due to coughing. Such ventilatory maneuvers might be usefully applied to the fight against flu pandemics and other widespread respiratory infection outbreaks.",

Also, because of the Hering Breuer inspiration inhibiting reflex (HBIIR), after inspiratory \u201cswitch-off\u201d the V\nT induces the expiratory phase. The tendency to expire is strong at the end of tidal inspiration [5]. Therefore, stimulation of laryngeal RARs interrupts the inspiration and evokes laryngoconstriction and the expiration reflex (ExpR) [1, 7, 8]. Additionally, an inspired or inflated volume above the normal V\nT or blockade of lung deflation at the beginning of expiration by positive pressure can adequately speed up and increase the intensity of the subsequent expiratory effort. It is caused by stimulation of airway receptors and manifests as the Hering Breuer expiration facilitating reflex (HBEFR) [5].",

Such rapid expiratory efforts might promote expulsion of infected mucus, preventing its protrusion from the larynx to the lungs and preclude, or at least postpone, the development of dangerous aspiration pneumonia [13]. A proposed voluntary breathing maneuver consists of several rapid sniffs with a closed mouth of 0.5 s duration, each followed by forced expiration lasting about 3 s. Such a maneuver might save many lives and improve the quality of life of millions of people worldwide during imminent flu pandemics or other widespread respiratory infections. The early inspiratory sniffs and other spasmodic inspirations, including provocation of the AspR, result in down-regulation of coughing and may substantially retard a flu or other respiratory infection pandemic.",

Such up-regulation may prevent, or at least postpone, the development of mostly fatal aspiration pneumonia. The sniff- and gasp-like AspR provoked by nasopharyngeal stimulation in anesthetized cats decreased the number and intensity of cough efforts provoked in the tracheobronchial region [9]. Similarly, the urge to cough may be suppressed, and even the motor act of coughing might be inhibited or at least postponed by voluntary action, helping to decrease the dissemination of airborne infections [11, 12]. Rapid, deep breaths through the nose, but not through the mouth, have bronchoprotective and bronchospasmolytic effects in probands and patients with mild bronchial asthma. This bronchoprotective effect in humans requires rapid inspiratory airflow [14, 15]. The sniff-like voluntary inspiration decreases the bronchoconstriction detected by one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), induced by metacholine inhalation in adult asthmatics [16] and decreased the number of coughs provoked by capsaicin inhalation in young asthmatics [17]. These results indicate a reflex origin of the bronchodilator effect of nasopharyngeal stimulation, which decreases in parallel with bronchodilation and bronchoconstrictor-triggered coughing [18]. Taking advantage of voluntary airway reflexes and ventilatory maneuvers have many important practical applications [19]. They include detection of preparatory movement activity in the premotor area in persons in a vegetative state [20, 21]. The control of wheelchairs by trained paraplegics [22] can be reproduced by voluntary performance of aspiration and expiration reflexes, representing binary signals [19]. Gasping respiration developing in animals can provide autoresuscitation for few minutes even during cardiac arrest [23]. Therefore, provocation of the gasp-like AspR persisting even in agonal state or voluntary sniffs, might provide autoresuscitation in emergency situations [7, 19].",
