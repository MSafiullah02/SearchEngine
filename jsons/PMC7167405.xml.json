The diluting effect in NPIR has been reported to be influenced by the airflow pattern along with the air changing rate.5 NPIR requires air exchange at least 6 times per hour (hospital room) or 12 times (new or renovated building).67 An examinee in the booth will be asked to sampling procedure while he or she temporarily put off his or her mask, and the procedure could inevitably cause them to cough or sneeze.

NPIR doors should be always closed, but in the case of walk-through system, examinees frequently enter and exit, so there is a possibility that proper negative pressure may not be maintained due to the inflow of external air.
