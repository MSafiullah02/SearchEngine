            "text": "(+)RNA viruses replicate their genomic RNA in viral RNA replication complexes (vRCs) including viral replicase proteins, viral RNA, and host proteins, on specific rearranged intracellular membranes (Ahlquist, 2006, Ahlquist et al., 2003, Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008, Sasvari and Nagy, 2010). Different viruses form their vRCs on diverse intracellular organelle membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (Diaz et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2001, Mas and Beachy, 1999, Pedersen et al., 1999, Schlegel et al., 1996, Schmidt-Mende et al., 2001), Golgi apparatus (Schlegel et al., 1996), lysosomes (Froshauer et al., 1988, Kujala et al., 2001, Magliano et al., 1998, Schlegel et al., 1996), endosomes (Froshauer et al., 1988, Kujala et al., 2001), peroxisomes (Jonczyk et al., 2007, White and Nagy, 2004) and mitochondria (Miller and Ahlquist, 2002, Miller et al., 2001). Lipids are major components of intracellular membranes, as they control membrane fluidity and plasticity (Nohturfft and Zhang, 2009, van Meer et al., 2008), and membrane lipids facilitate the RNA replication of (+)RNA viruses (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008). For instance, the complete activity of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) NSP1 protein, an mRNA capping enzyme, requires association with specific negative phospholipids (Ahola et al., 1999). Sphingomyelin has been found to activate the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b (Weng et al., 2010). The precise functions of intracellular membranes, particularly membrane lipids, in the RNA replication of (+)RNA viruses have not been fully understood, but possibly include offering an optimal microenvironment for viral replicase enzymatic activities, facilitating the use of membrane-associated host cofactors and/or directly interacting with viral replicases to mediate their functions (Chukkapalli et al., 2012, Heaton and Randall, 2011).",

Moreover, a subgenomic RNA3 (sgRNA3), is synthesized during RNA1 replication and encodes protein B2, a suppressor of antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) (Li et al., 2002). Nodaviruses express a sole RNA replicase, protein A, which is responsible for both membrane association and viral RNA replication (Ball, 1995, Kopek et al., 2007, Miller and Ahlquist, 2002, Miller et al., 2001, Venter and Schneemann, 2008). This characteristic renders nodaviruses like Flock House virus (FHV) and WhNV simplified and ideal models for studying viral RNA replication.",

Previous studies of FHV indicated that membrane lipids mediate FHV RNA protein A function. The in vitro study showed that complete replication activity of FHV vRCs isolated from intracellular membrane require the addition of exogenous phospholipids (Wu et al., 1992, Wu and Kaesberg, 1991). FHV RNA replication in Drosophila cells can be blocked by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005). Moreover, FHV protein A is a lipid-binding protein with particular affinity for specific anionic phospholipids, which may regulate the protein A-membrane interactions (Stapleford et al., 2009). However, although membrane lipids play an important role in nodaviral RNA replication, the detailed mechanisms by which membrane lipids regulate the activities of nodaviral protein A are not well understood.",

To this end, we first examined whether WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 and RNA2 in vitro, and then explored the direct effects of MMLs on the RNA binding of protein A. We found that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner, and the cooperativity could be stimulated by high protein A concentrations. MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding activity of protein A, and this stimulation exhibited strong selectivity for different phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher but not at lower protein A concentrations. Further investigation showed that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding activity of protein A by promoting its self-interaction. Finally, we further confirmed that the MML composition changes by manipulating phospholipid metabolism affect protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment in cells.",

Previous study reported that nodaviruses contain the conversed sequences in the 5\u2032-proximal region of RNA1 that exhibit a stem-loop structure and are responsible for RNA recruitment (Van Wynsberghe and Ahlquist, 2009). According to WhNV, its RNA1 nt 50\u2013118 [RNA1(50\u2013118)] exhibited a similar secondary structure (\nFig. 1B). To examine whether these sequences are responsible for WhNV RNA1 recruitment/stabilization in cells, we constructed two RNA1 derivates and examined their recruitment in the presence of WhNV replication-incompetent protein AGAA (Fig. 1A). The plasmid pAC1E, in which an (enhanced green fluorescent protein) EGFP open reading frame (ORF) is inserted at the 3\u2032 end of RNA1 sequence (Qiu et al., 2013), is a functional template for RNA1 replication (the transcribed and replicated products are labeled as \u201cRNA1E\u201d), but the ORF of protein A is closed by the mutation of the start codon (Qiu et al., 2013). WhNV Protein AGAA is provided by the plasmid pAGAA. The RdRp activity of Protein AGAA is nulled by mutating the GDD replication site to GAA as previously described (Qiu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013). Protein AGAA retained its RNA1 recruitment activity despite losing its RNA replicase activity (Qiu et al., 2013).",

To further characterize the behavior of protein A when it binds to RNA1, we incubated progressively increasing amounts of MBP-protA (0.1\u20136 \u03bcM) with 20 nM of DIG-labeled RNA1(50\u2013118) (Fig. 2E). In the presence of a small amount of MBP-protA, the RNA probe was found mostly in free form, while increasing the amount of MBP-protA resulted in a rapid transition of the RNA probe to bound form (Fig. 2E). The minimal ratio of protein A to RNA probe for RNA binding is about 10:1 (Fig. 2E, lane 3; 0.2 \u03bcM of MBP-protA to 20 nM of RNA probe), while the bound band was clearly visible at the protein concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM (Fig. 2E, lane 4). The binding curve based on Fig. 2E also indicated that the amount of bound RNA is linked to the concentration of MBP-protA (Fig. 2F). And the apparent dissociation constant Kd was calculated as 1.9 \u03bcM for protein A at an RNA probe concentration of 20 nM (Fig. 2F). Moreover, the RNA binding data were quantified, and a Hill transformation was applied to determine whether the binding of protein A to RNA1 is cooperative [i.e., that the binding of protein A to RNA increased the affinity of protein A to bind to additional RNA molecules; a >1 Hill coefficient indicates positive cooperativity (Rajendran and Nagy, 2003)]. Interestingly, protein A at low concentrations (0.1\u20132 \u03bcM) had a Hill coefficient value of ~1.433, whereas high protein concentrations had a higher value of ~2.429 (Fig. 2G). These results indicate that protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner, and higher protein A concentrations (>2 \u03bcM) yield higher cooperativity.",

To this end, we conducted RNA binding experiments under the conditions described in Fig. 2E except the addition of 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl MMLs to the reaction mixtures and increasing the amount of RNA probe to 0.2 \u03bcM, because the activity of protein A binding to RNA is significantly stimulated in the presence of MMLs. Because the changes of the migration of protein\u2013RNA complex with the addition of MMLs were not significant in 1.0% agarose gel (Fig. 2E), we used 2.0% agarose gel to separate the samples in this assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, increasing the amount of MMLs resulted in a rapid transition of the RNA probe to bound form and obvious changes of the migration of protein\u2013RNA complex at the high protein concentrations. The RNA binding data was applied to Hill transformation (Fig. 3D) and compared to that in the absence of MMLs (Fig. 2G). Very interestingly, although the presence of MMLs had little effect on the cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA1 (Hill coefficient value: 1.477 with MMLs vs. 1.433 without MMLs) at lower concentrations of MBP-protA, it substantially stimulated the cooperativity at higher protein concentrations (>3 \u03bcM), as the Hill coefficient value was dramatically increased from 2.429 (Fig. 2G) to 6.163 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, we conclude that the cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA is stimulated by MMLs only at high protein A concentrations.",

The cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA1 in the presence of PC was similar to that in the absence of MMLs. The presence of PC resulted in little effect on the cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA at low protein concentrations (0.1\u20132 \u03bcM) (Hill coefficient value: 1.342 with PC vs. 1.433 without PC) and high protein concentrations (>2 \u03bcM) (Hill coefficient value: 2.7022 with PC vs. 2.429 without MMLs).

To examine this possibility, we incubated the increasing amounts of MMLs with RNA1(50\u2013118) probe and 0.5 \u03bcM MBP-protA fragments. As shown in Fig. 5C, increasing MML concentrations dramatically enhanced the RNA binding of protein A aa 1\u2013254 (lanes 9\u201312), but did not affected the RNA binding of protein A aa 660\u20131014 (lanes 1\u20134) due to the lack of membrane-binding activity as expected. Moreover, we used a mutant protein A aa 1\u2013254 fragment, aa 1\u2013254/M1 (K91A, W92A, and R93A), whose MML-binding and RNA-binding activities are intact but self-interaction activity is nulled as described previously (Qiu et al., 2014). Our data show that MMLs only moderately stimulate the RNA binding of aa 1\u2013254/M1 (Fig. 5C, lanes 5\u20138), indicating that the substantial stimulatory effect of MMLs on the RNA binding requires the self-interaction of protein A. Together, these results indicate that MMLs stimulate RNA binding of protein A via binding to protein A and mediating protein A self-interaction.",

To advance the understanding of the relationship between intracellular membranes and viral RNA replicases, we studied the direct effects of MMLs on the RNA binding of WhNV protein A. We uncover that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner, and the cooperativity could be stimulated by high protein A concentrations. MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding activity of protein A, and this stimulation exhibited strong selectivity for different phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher protein A concentrations. Furthermore, manipulating phospholipid metabolisms significantly inhibited protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment/stabilization in cells. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the important role of MMLs in the RNA binding activity of WhNV protein A to properly function as a viral RNA replicase.",

            "text": "For (+)RNA viruses, recruiting RNA to membranes by viral replicases is an essential step prior to RNA replication (Pogany et al., 2005, Schwartz et al., 2002, Sullivan and Ahlquist, 1999, Van Wynsberghe and Ahlquist, 2009, Van Wynsberghe et al., 2007). The direct RNA\u2013protein interaction was stimulated by MMLs (Fig. 3A) indicating that MMLs play a direct role in regulating the activity of WhNV protein A to recruit viral genomic RNA. Binding to RNA in a cooperative manner can be advantageous for genomic RNA recruitment, since this may increase the stability of protein\u2013RNA complexes in cells. Therefore, many viral proteins, including NS5B of HCV (Wang et al., 2002), 3D of poliovirus (Arnold and Cameron, 1999), p33 of Tomato bushy stunt virus (Rajendran and Nagy, 2003) and N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Chang et al., 2009) were all found to bind viral RNAs cooperatively. The novel findings of this current work are that the cooperativity of WhNV protein A binding to RNA1 can be stimulated by MMLs and, very interestingly, this stimulation takes effect only at high protein A concentrations (Figs. 2G and 3D; Hill co-efficient: 6.613 vs 2.429 at high concentrations; 1.477 vs 1.433 at low concentrations). The functional significance of this phenomenon is currently not known. A reasonable speculation is that MMLs regulate viral replication by modulating the distribution of viral genomic RNA between translational machinery and vRCs during different stages of viral infection. At a very early stage, few viral genomic RNAs and replicases exist, and the priority of nodaviral RNA1 is to function as mRNA to translate sufficient protein A. As more and more protein A molecular is translated from RNA1 and moves to membranes, resulting in the increased density of protein A on membranes, the priority of RNA1 subsequently shifts to replicate more viral RNAs. Thus, at this stage, the cooperative binding of protein A to RNA1 was substantially stimulated by MMLs, thereby resulting in the recruitment of otherwise cytoplasmic RNA1 to membranes to form vRCs.",

            "text": "Most (+)RNA viruses typically encode multiple viral replicase proteins, and their intermolecular interactions are critical for RNA replication (Diaz et al., 2012, Dye et al., 2005, Panavas et al., 2005, Panaviene et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2002). For nodavirus, the self-interaction of protein A, the sole replicase, is required for RNA replication (Dye et al., 2005). Moreover, three-dimensional analysis showed that FHV protein A forms higher-order oligomers in spherules (Kopek et al., 2007). These results indicated that the polymerization of nodaviral protein A is required for RNA replication. However, the precise role of polymerization/self-interaction is currently not known. The study reported here highlighted the relationship between the RNA binding and self-interaction of nodaviral protein A. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding of protein A to RNA by promoting its self-interaction. First, we showed that protein A aa 1\u2013254/M1 mediates RNA binding and MML binding, whereas protein A aa 1\u2013254 are responsible for RNA binding, MML binding and protein A self-interaction (Fig. 5C). The RNA binding of protein A aa 1\u2013254/M1 was moderately affected by MMLs, whereas the RNA binding of protein A aa 1\u2013254 was substantially stimulated by MMLs (Fig. 5C), indicating that the substantial stimulatory effect of MMLs on the RNA binding requires protein A self-interaction. However, the contribution of the direct MML-protein A interaction to the RNA binding cannot be omitted but may not be the main reason for the substantial stimulation of MMLs on protein A binding to RNA. Furthermore, we found that higher concentrations of FL protein A stimulated the cooperativity of its binding to RNA even in the absence of MMLs (Fig. 2G). Given that protein\u2013RNA interaction occurred in a pure reaction solution, which contains only RNA probe and protein A, the higher concentration-induced increase in protein A self-interaction should be the cause of the enhanced cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA1. Therefore, our findings indicate that MMLs stimulate protein A self-interaction, which in turn substantially promotes the efficiency of the cooperative binding of protein A to RNA. The activities of per unit protein A recruiting (+)RNA1E and self-interaction are tightly linked in cells further confirm the relationship between these two activities of protein A (Fig. 7).",

Many previous studies showed that certain phospholipids have different effects on different (+)RNA replicases. The particular phospholipids enriched in certain intercellular membranes, which are associated with different viruses, show preferential and direct effects on the activities of replicases. According to nodavirus, WhNV protein A activities (Qiu et al., 2014) (Fig. 4) can be mediated by specific anionic phospholipids CL, PA and PG that are enriched in mitochondrial membranes (van Meer et al., 2008), the sites of which WhNV and FHV protein As are associated with (Miller and Ahlquist, 2002, Miller et al., 2001, Qiu et al., 2013). These certain lipids may mediate protein A activities by partitioning protein A into liposome fraction and thus leading to the increase of protein A\u05f3s local density. Indeed, the RNA binding to protein A is cooperative, and the cooperativity could be enhanced by higher protein A concentration (Fig. 2G), indicating that protein As show stronger RNA binding activity when they are gathered together.",

That may be partly due to the fact that the simplified in vitro systems cannot represent the complexity of the protein A in cells.

(B) Summary the domains of WhNV protein A responsible for self-interaction, MMLs binding and RNA binding, representing the results shown in Fig. 5A and our previous study (Qiu et al., 2014). \u201c+/\u2212\u201d represents that the self-interaction of aa 481\u2013659 is weak (Qiu et al., 2014). (C) The effect of MMLs on the RNA binding of protein A fragments was indicated \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d, representing the results as indicated below. \u201c+/\u2212\u201d represents that the stimulatory effect of MMLs on the RNA binding is limited. Increasing concentrations of MMLs were incubated with protein A fragments aa 660\u20131014 (lanes 2\u20134), 1\u2013254/M1 (lanes 6\u20138) or 1\u2013254 (lanes 10\u201312) and RNA1(50\u2013118) probe, and the protein\u2013RNA complex was separated in a gel mobility shift assay. (D,E) Cooperative binding of protein A fragment aa 660\u20131014 to RNA1(50\u2013118). Gel mobility shift assays were performed using increasing molar concentrations of MBP-protA aa 660\u20131014 incubated with RNA1(50\u2013118) probe. The Hill coefficients of the RNA binding of protein A at low and high protein concentrations are indicated (E).",
