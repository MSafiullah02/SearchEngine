For instance, most cases shared a history of visiting or working at a seafood market in Wuhan [3], where exposure to the novel coronavirus is suspected to have occurred with no evidence of direct human-to-human transmission [2], although human-to-human transmission was found later to be common. Observed characteristics of the outbreak led us to believe that the cluster of cases was due to \u201cDisease X\u201d (i.e., an infectious disease of previously unknown viral etiology). However, rigorous quantitative assessment based on these characteristics of the chance that the manifestations of atypical pneumonia were in fact Disease X has not previously been undertaken. The present study addresses this, demonstrating that non-virological information can lead to an objective classification of Disease X, using a simple statistical model that exploits the well-known Bayes\u2019 theorem.",

Our analysis began on 30 December 2019, when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced that there had been a surprisingly large number of atypical pneumonia cases. At that time, we assumed the causative agent could have been one of eight known viral or three known bacterial pathogens, along with the chance that it was instead Disease X. We tracked two active medical social media sites (ProMED [9] and Flutracker [10]) that collected reports of the non-virological characteristics of the outbreak as it progressed. These characteristics were basic observations from the outbreak and do not necessarily represent the features that were causing symptoms. Given these characteristics, we then calculated the probability that the ongoing outbreak was due to a known pathogen or unknown Disease X. On the first day of calculation (i.e., 30 December 2019)\u2014the day that we became aware of the outbreak\u2014the only explanatory factor we included was diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, which was common to all pathogens considered in our dataset. Our analysis represents simple logical deductions from the limited data that were available during the outbreak in a quantitative manner and was updated to reflect new information about the outbreak as it became available in real time.",

Each characteristic listed was assigned a value of zero or one, denoting whether or not the outbreak characteristic was likely in general (rather than for individual cases) for the emerging outbreak, and the equivalent values for outbreaks of previously observed pathogens were also noted. We note that some information believed at the time was later found to be untrue; for example, it was believed that human-to-human transmission was infrequent. Consequently, inclusion of a large number of characteristics is important for our analysis. Once pathogens were ruled out as the causative agent of the current outbreak, they were removed from our analysis: for example, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI; H5N1) was confirmed not to be the causative agent by laboratory testing on 3 January 2020. Hence, we omitted this pathogen from our analysis from that date onwards. We performed two versions of our analysis to demonstrate how our results might change with the inclusion of different outbreak characteristics. In the first, all characteristics in Table 1 were included in the analysis. In the second, information about the exposure location (i.e., exposure at a wet market) was excluded from the analysis.",

We assumed that the probability that the outbreak is due to a variant of pathogen j decreased exponentially with distance dj.

The constants qi represented a priori probabilities that the outbreak is due to pathogen i [11,12]. We set uninformative priors for all pathogens considered, so that qi was simply the reciprocal of the number of pathogens being considered (including Disease X) on each date in our analysis. We initially estimated the distance between observed characteristics of the outbreak and each known candidate pathogen using the Hamming distance (i.e., the sum of squares differences between the entries in the columns of Table 1 corresponding to the Disease X and the candidate pathogen). Then, we assumed that the probability that the outbreak is driven by pathogen j was governed by a negative exponential function,\n(2)Pr(observed characteristics | pathogen j)\u221dexp(\u2212dj)\nwhere dj is the calculated Hamming distance, although in principle any decreasing relationship, and any metric describing the distance between two vectors, could have been used.",

This was demonstrated using a series of clinical, occupational, and behavioral observations extracted from fragmented reports describing the cases as these reports became available in real time [3,6]. Although virological investigation is the gold standard for pathogen identification, and the virus has now been confirmed to be a novel coronavirus that is a relative of SARS, laboratory-based outcomes can only be obtained after successfully sequencing the novel virus, which can sometimes be a lengthy process. At the time of writing, it still remains for the microbiological causal link to be established, for instance by ensuring that Koch\u2019s postulates are met (as seen, e.g., in a study of Zika virus [13]). In the ongoing outbreak, the provisional identification of a novel coronavirus was performed on 7 January 2020 and announced formally on 9 January 2020 [2]. We have shown that non-virological information can indicate that the cause of the outbreak is likely to be a novel pathogen (\u201cDisease X\u201d), and that this conclusion was obtained before virological test results were announced. Disease X was inferred to be very likely on all dates from 31 December 2019 onwards\u2014the date on which descriptions of outbreak characteristics began to emerge.",

With such information, non-virological data can be used for convenient quantification of the probability that the outbreak was due to a novel pathogen, while awaiting the results of virological tests.

First, a critical underlying assumption is that Table 1 represents general outbreak characteristics of the ongoing outbreak and previously known outbreaks. The representation does not reflect observations from all confirmed cases nor epidemiological findings from a case control study (e.g., statistically significant risk factors). Rather, zeros and ones in the table were defined in a phenomenological manner, and values may change as the ongoing outbreak continues. Depending on the opinions of different experts (e.g., [14]), the defined nominal values could have been different to those shown in Table 1; in this study, we are simply demonstrating how such an approach might work in practice. Second, as we have shown, quantitative estimates depend on the precise characteristics that are used. We showed results including and not including information on wet market exposure. In Table 1, infections due to previously observed pathogens other than HPAI were assumed not to be associated with exposure to wet markets. Since this assumption was not derived from empirical observations, it could be debated.",

When outbreak characteristics are shared and updated in real-time (Table 1), these data can contribute to efforts to narrow down the possible range of causative agents. In the case of the outbreak in Wuhan, our calculation of the probability that each pathogen is the causative agent indicates that virological exclusion of influenza viruses, adenoviruses and known virulent coronaviruses associated with SARS and MERS on 3 and 5 January 2020 can be regarded as an \u201cunsurprising\u201d finding.",

First, our proposed approach used very limited data in Table 1 for logical quantification of the probability that each pathogen was the causative agent. However, with more clinical data, the binary characteristics could be replaced by continuous frequencies (e.g., the proportion of cases experiencing coughing and/or breathing difficulties). Second, with sufficient data it would also be possible to estimate the probability that each pathogen is the causal agent (Equation (1)) not by arbitrarily measuring the distance but by using classification models involving regression or more sophisticated machine learning approaches. Third, the erroneous input of incorrect information may be a challenge in real time analyses. The veracity of the sources of information for future analyses could have an impact on the resulting probability calculations. Fourth, the estimated probability that an outbreak is driven by a novel pathogen might be slightly over- or underestimated due to limited information about the mode of transmission and small numbers of observed cases. Of note, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was not completely ruled out as a candidate pathogen in our real-time analysis. However, RSV was an unlikely candidate since the majority of cases in the ongoing outbreak are adults [15] while most RSV infections are observed in infants and young children. Finally, we had to restrict ourselves to assuming the a priori probability that the ongoing outbreak driven by each candidate pathogens (qi) is identical for each pathogen. However, since no alternative information was available, we believe such uninformative priors to be the optimal choice.",

We reached this conclusion after only a few days of the outbreak had passed. Attention has now rightly turned towards identifying the pandemic potential of this outbreak [16,17,18], as well as planning control interventions within China and elsewhere [19,20]. However, at the start of the next outbreak of an unknown pathogen, virological testing and quantitative analyses of clinical data are two complementary methods that can be used.

Arrows indicate new information available on each date. Results are shown for different metrics describing the distance between characteristics of the ongoing outbreak and each candidate pathogen, and either including or excluding initial exposure information for the current outbreak (i.e., worked at/visited a wet market), specifically: (A) Hamming distance (the sum of squares difference between the entries in the columns of Table 1 corresponding to the ongoing outbreak and the candidate pathogen considered) with wet market exposure; (B) Euclidean distance (the square root of the Hamming distance) with wet market exposure; (C) Hamming distance without wet market exposure; (D) Euclidean distance without wet market exposure.
