Using sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids and sequencing, the presence of anelloviruses in VF samples from patients with SHAPU was demonstrated. This finding was corroborated by nested PCR assays showing a significantly higher prevalence of the human anelloviruses TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV in eyes of SHAPU patients compared with disease controls. Since the discovery of TTV and related anelloviruses approximately 15 years ago, many investigations have been carried out to unravel their epidemiological, clinical, and pathogenic properties. Anellovirus has been associated with several diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatic diseases, cancer, systemic lupus erythematosis, non-A-E hepatitis, and asthma [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Herein, we present data showing the presence of anelloviruses in VF of patients with ocular diseases, indicating a novel association between these viruses and uveitis, particularly in SHAPU patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 871, "end": 875, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 876, "end": 880, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 881, "end": 885, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 886, "end": 890, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 891, "end": 895, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 896, "end": 900, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 901, "end": 905, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Analyses of the clinical parameters and patient characteristics available for review revealed 2 major differences between SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients. SHAPU patients were usually children <10 years of age who underwent a therapeutic vitrectomy commonly within the first week of disease, the treatment of choice to preserve visual acuity in SHAPU patients [1, 2] . Non-SHAPU patients, however, were all adults and were first treated symptomatically using antibiotics, antivirals, and/or corticosteroids. Therapeutic vitrectomy was applied as a second treatment option, usually multiple weeks after onset of disease (data not shown). In herpesvirus-and T. gondii-induced infectious uveitis, the intraocular viral and parasitic load is inversely correlated with duration of disease, mainly owing to effectiveness of the local immune response evoked upon intraocular infection [2, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Because significant differences in intraocular viral loads in TTV PCR-positive SHAPU and non-SHAPU VF samples were not observed, it is unlikely that disease duration influences the detection of anellovirus. The high incidence of SHAPU in young children contrasts with the increased risk of uveitis with increasing age [43] [44] [45] . Children may be more prone to ocular infection with anelloviruses than are adults, as was previously described for other viral diseases such as the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus [46] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 874, "end": 877, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 878, "end": 882, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 883, "end": 887, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 888, "end": 892, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 893, "end": 897, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 898, "end": 902, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1227, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1232, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1429, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The absence of anelloviruses in VF samples of retinal detachment patients suggests an association between ocular inflammation and ocular anellovirus infection. Ocular inflammation causes perturbation of the blood-ocular barrier, specifically barrier permeability, in many models of retinal disease [29] . Because anellovirus infections cause a chronic plasma viremia in most infected individuals [23] , detection of anelloviruses in VF samples may be the result of passive entry of blood-derived anelloviruses into the vitreous cavity due to breakdown of the blood-retina barrier in uveitis patients. Indeed, most of the SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients with anellovirus-positive VF also had TTV, TTMDV, and/or TTMV viremia. Moreover, the median TTV load in VF was relatively low compared with that previously described in serum of viremic individuals [23] . These observations, in conjunction with the phylogenetic analysis of TTV in the paired serum and VF samples, suggest that the anelloviruses in VF samples of both SHAPU and non-SHAPU patients have most likely originated from the systemic TTV pool upon inflammation-induced disruption of the blood-ocular barrier. However, exogenous sources of the anelloviruses in VF cannot be ruled out. For example, the VF sample of SHAPU patient SV-2 was TTMDV PCR positive in the absence of a detectable TTMDV viremia (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 298, "end": 302, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 396, "end": 400, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 848, "end": 852, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1359, "end": 1368, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In both scenarios, the epidemiological association between epidemics of SHAPU and the seasonal presence of white moths may be a key factor to explain the higher prevalence of anelloviruses in SHAPU patients.

Notably, SHAPU patients document close contact with white moths [1, 2, 4] , and moth hairs have incidentally been detected in corneas or even in the anterior chamber of SHAPU patients (A. Manandhar, unpublished observation). Cornea-penetrating moth hairs could cause intraocular inflammation, allowing passive entry of anelloviruses into the vitreous cavity from the bloodstream. Alternatively, the ocular-penetrating hairs may be contaminated with anelloviruses, resulting in direct inoculation of the virus into the eye.
