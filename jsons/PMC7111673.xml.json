The morphological control of particles is one method for creating new functions and improving the performance of polymeric nanoparticles. Since it is expected that non-spherical nanoparticles can have a larger specific area and higher material sorbability than nanospheres of equal size, particles of various morphologies, such as raspberry-like [4], [5], snowman-like [6], [7], and virus-like [8], [9] have been prepared by multistep preparation techniques such as hetero aggregation [8], [9] and seed polymerization [4], [5], [6], [7].",

A similarity to the virus arises since these nanoparticles are formed by the self-organization of the macromolecular chains. Another similarity is based on the morphology. Tomato bushy stunt virus has a diameter of 33 nm and 90 projections with a length of 3 nm on the surface [11], while the viruses in coronavirus group has a diameter range 75\u2013160 nm and many projections with a length range 12\u201314 nm [12]. Most viruses have the projections with a bigger or smaller size on the surface to a greater or less extent; the viruses have a variety of projection morphology in terms of the size, the number, and the inter-projection distance, showing individual living characteristics. On the other hand, the morphology and number density of projection coronas of the present synthetic nanoparticles have never been controlled although the growth of the projections was observed by a change in the polymerization time [13]. In this paper, we aim to give a variety of the morphology of the nanoparticle by controlling the particle size, the projection size, the projection number, and the inter-projection spacing. We find that the morphology is successfully controlled by changing the solvent for self-organization, and the morphology control is very effective on the water-dispersibility of the nanoparticles.",

PEG with a molecular weight of 10,000 was used as a sample because a polymer chain with a larger molecular weight shows a larger change in reduced viscosity by a conformation change. The reduced viscosity increased with increasing water composition showing that the PEG chain took an extended conformation because of increased solvent affinity when the water composition increased. This finding suggests that PEGm graft chains existing on the nanoparticle surface take an extended conformation in a high water composition environment.",

The O/C ratio slightly decreased with an increase in water composition while the N/C ratio increased. This result shows that the amount of AN increased on the particle surface as the water composition increased in spite of a decrease in the bulk composition from 57.6 to 47.3 unit mol%. This phenomenon indicated the excess surface accumulation of AN units, which may be associated with the fact that PAN has some solubility in water/ethanol solvent [15]. Since the number of projections also increased, we can support the previously-proposed hypothesis that the projection was mainly comprised of AN [13]. The slight decrease in O/C may result from a decrease in the relative amount of PEG to AN units.",

            "text": "Based on these results, we discussed the reason for the change in the arrangement of projection coronas on the nanoparticles. We previously proposed a hierarchical structure for the nanoparticles with projection coronas: PEG grafts exist on an AN-rich shell covering the St-rich core [13]. Since the nanoparticle created from St and PEGm formed no projections, AN is indispensable in the formation of projection coronas [13]. Since PAN has some solubility in water/ethanol solvent [15], PAN chains having PEGm grafts may be capable of solvating. The shell in PAN and PEGm may be swollen in solvent with connecting to a PSt core. According to a previous study, the morphology was spherical at the beginning of polymerization, and the projection grew with polymerization time but the number of projections was constant regardless of polymerization time [13]. Namely, the number of projections is determined at the early stages of projection formation where PEGm chains first stick out from the shell dragging out PAN units with them. In this case, the solvent affinity of a PEGm may be an important factor for projection formation. If the water composition is higher, a larger number of AN units exist on the particle surface (Fig. 6) in the presence of better-solvated PEGm chain yielding a larger number of projection nuclei. The solvation can give a chain mobility to make a crystallization of AN units and the projection is formed. If the AN composition is high, the crystal growth happens in a lot of parts because a number of crystal nuclei were formed on the particle surface. The higher projection population might make its size (Fig. 8\n). Thus, solvent affinity is a crucial factor in controlling particle morphology.",

When the water composition was increased up to 50 vol% to total solvent volume, the particle size increased, the projection size decreased, the number of projections increased, and the spacing between projections decreased. On the other hand, nanoparticles with projection coronas were not formed when the water composition was higher than 50 vol% since the dispersion system was not created during polymerization. The morphology control was based on the solvent affinity of PEGm graft chains, which extended better in higher water compositions and concentrate the AN units in the shell layer to form larger amount of crystalline projections. The ratio of the specific surface area to the particle volume was from 1.7\u00d710\u22122 to 2.2\u00d710\u22122\n nm2/nm3, which is twice as large as that of nanospheres of equal size. The increased number of the projection with the reduced size was effective on increasing the water-dispersibility of the nanoparticles. As a result, we prepared the nanoparticles with various morphologies similar with the viruses in the coronavirus group. The study is currently continuing to investigate the morphology-specific catch-up behavior of the nano-sized materials such as viruses using the inter-projection gap on the nanospheres.",
