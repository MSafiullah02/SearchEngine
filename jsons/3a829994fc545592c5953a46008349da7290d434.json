With a novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus, as the etiologic agent [Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003] , the disease spread rapidly across the world, infecting individuals in several countries with a fatality rate of $10% [Gu and Korteweg, 2007] . In this study, a cDNA library was generated from the autopsy lung tissue of a SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infected patient by using random primers. cDNA cloning is a fundamental technology for researches in gene discovery and transcriptome analysis [Harbers, 2008] . However, standard cDNA missed many transcripts that lack poly(A) tails Kapranov et al., 2007] . Reverse transcription reactions through alternative random primers of six nucleotides would have more tendency to clone transcripts lacking poly(A) tails, such as ncRNAs and ploy(A)-mRNAs, with more chances to find novel transcripts as compared to cDNA library generated by oligo (dT) primers. In addition, the data presented in this paper is also a human cDNA library generated from SARS-CoV infected lung tissue, which might contribute to the human genomic analyses and the SARS pathological researches.",

The CoVinfected library showed a significant small sum up value (257.91%, P-value \u00bc 0.028) of the relative counts of the second-level GO categories in the biological process main category, implying less tentative multiple function genes in the CoV-infected lung tissue concerning biological process.

It was reported that a large proportion of the transcripts in human and mouse were unique to the largely unstudied poly(A\u00c0) fractions of the transcriptome Kiyosawa et al., 2005] . In addition, recent studies revealed that protein-coding loci are more transcriptionally complex than previously thought, and there is often no clear distinction between splice variants and overlapping and neighboring genes [Carninci et al., 2005; Birney et al., 2007] . This might explain to some extent why, in the present study, most ESTs matching to known proteins with coverage less than 70% (Fig. 2 ). It appears that much more of the human genome is transcribed than was previously appreciated. Genomic tiling arrays revealed a large number of novel transcribed regions throughout the ENCODE region from different cell types and NB4 cells treated with different conditions [Rozowsky et al., 2006] . 5 0 -RACE and 3 0 -RACE sequencing uncovered transcription in previous non-transcribed regions of the human genome [Wu et al., 2008] . These two studies focused on the poly(A\u00fe) RNAs and transcripts were obtained by specific primers. The present study revealed 448 novel transcriptional loci lacking EST or mRNA signal records (Table IV) .

After taking into consideration of the RNA-seq, at least 15 novel transcriptional loci (BLAT identity > 97%) were still found where EST or RNA-seq records were lacking (Table IV) . Additionally, RNA-seq libraries downloaded from NCBI were mapped to the transcripts of the SARS-CoV library and the ''reads of match per kilo base'' was calculated. The result showed that novel ESTs (1,364 transcripts without EST signal, see This study also revealed 281 assembled sequences that matched with both protein sequence data and ncRNA sequence data (Fig. 3) , which might result from the parallel production of protein-coding sequences, regulatory ncRNAs, and introns. The latter, perhaps as a major source of regulatory ncRNAs, accounted for at least 30% of the human genome [Mattick and Makunin, 2006 ]. Some of the ncRNAs including microRNAs found in this study might be related with the pathology of SARS-CoV infection and worth for further studying. Recent reports provided strong evidence that micro-RNAs and other ncRNAs are linked to the pathological conditions of some human diseases [Costa, 2007] . Viral transcripts were also regulated by Host-encoded miR-NAs. Human miR-32 has been reported to restrict the replication of primate foamy virus type 1 (PFV-1) [Lecellier et al., 2005] . The 3 0 portion of HIV-1 mRNAs was shown to be redundantly targeted for repression by a cluster of human miRNAs . It was demonstrated that IFNa/b up regulated several cellular miRNAs that are capable of inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and infection. Down regulation of miR-122 in response to IFNb further contributes to the antiviral effects [Pedersen et al., 2007] .",

Genome sequencing revealed that 8% of the human genome consists of HERVs [Medstrand et al., 2002; Bannert and Kurth, 2004] . Different endogenous retroviruses also exhibit differential responsiveness to environmental signals and activation of the immune system [Taruscio and Mantovani, 2004] . It was reported that the expression of HERVs was affected by cytokines [Katsumata et al., 1999; Schneider et al., 2001] and steroids [Ono et al., 1987] . Recent report showed that HIV-1 infection leads to HERV expression and stimulation of a HERV-specific CD8\u00fe T cell response [Garrison et al., 2007] . The high level HERVs expression in this case might imply the steroid hormone therapy in the severe patient. According to the function annotation results, synapseassociated proteins were also over expressed in the SARS-CoV infected library (0.38% in ''synapse part'' and 1.14% in ''synapse''). Proteins in these categories were lipid-binding proteins in the synaptic vesicle, such as synaptotagmin and synaptoporin, and the postsynaptic element, such as cholinergic receptor. Since a line of evidence showed that steroid hormone increased synapse density [Jelks et al., 2007] or up-regulated the expression of synaptic proteins [Crispino et al., 1999; Rune et al., 2002; Kretz et al., 2004] , the high level expression of synaptic proteins in this case should have resulted from the high dose corticosteroids therapy in the severe patient.",

The result was consistent with the result of a recent study that SARS-CoV entered cells through direct fusion with the plasma membrane as well as a clathrinand caveolae-independent endocytic mechanism mediated by cholesterol-and sphingolipid lipid raft microdomains [Wang et al., 2008] and also consistent with the results of other studies that cytoskeleton reorganization and cellular signal transduction as well as endocytosis were inextricably linked [Balklava and Grant, 2005; Pelkmans, 2005; Pelkmans et al., 2005] .
