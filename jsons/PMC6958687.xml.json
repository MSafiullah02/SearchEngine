Furthermore, recent reports have indicated that waiting for lung transplantation with MV support is a risk factor for increased mortality compared without MV [9, 10]. Recently, due to advances in critical care management and improvements in technology regarding the safety profile and management of ECMO, the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation has steadily increased [11\u201313]. However, bridging to transplantation with ECMO has also been associated with major complications and increased in-hospital mortality [14, 15]. In addition, ECMO is invasive, requires anticoagulation for the duration of therapy, and can be associated with serious complications [16, 17]. Therefore, concerns remain about bridging patients with ECMO to lung transplantation. However, most data on lung transplantation after bridging with ECMO is drawn from retrospective, single-institution studies, and data describing long-term outcomes after lung transplantation are limited.",

The frequency of immediate complications was not different between the bridge-ECMO group and non-bridge-ECMO group. However, postoperative length of stay in the intensive care unit was longer in the bridge-ECMO group (33.0 days, IQR 23.0\u201343.5) compared with the non-bridge-ECMO group (9.0 days, IQR 6.0\u201316.0) (P <  0.001). In addition, the time from transplantation to hospital discharge was longer in the bridge-ECMO group (46.0 days, IQR 38.5\u201368.5) compared with the non-bridge-ECMO group (35.0 days, IQR 25.0\u201367.0) (P = 0.030). The hospital mortality for all patients was 16.4%, with no significant difference between the two groups (25.9% in bridge-ECMO group and 13.3% in non-bridge-ECMO group, P = 0.212). Partially dependent (43.8%) was the most common functional status at discharge, followed by fully independent (33.9%), and was not different between the two groups. The majority of patients (70.4% of bridge-ECMO group and 77.6% of non-bridge-ECMO group) were discharged to their homes. Only 5 patients (4.5%) required tracheostomy at discharge.\n",

Schechter et al. showed that 1-year survival was not different between bridge only with ECMO patients and control patients (70.4% versus 84.2%) [23]. In contrast, Inci et al. showed worse overall and 3 month conditional survivals in the bridge-ECMO group (n = 26) versus the non-bridge-ECMO group (n = 160) (68% versus 85%, p = 0.001; 86% versus 92%, p = 0.03, respectively) [15].

The strength of our study is that recent, multi-institutional data for lung transplantation and a large sample of bridge-ECMO patients were included.

Furthermore, ICU admission for ECMO management leads to ICU-acquired weakness and infection associated with catheter or ICU care [24, 25]. Our results indicate that post-operative bleeding (46.7%) is the most common immediate complication in bridge-ECMO patients, while infection (39.4%) is the most common in the non-bridge-ECMO group, although there were no significant differences in number of immediate complications after transplantation including post-operative bleeding, infection, and airway complications between the two groups. All patients but two showed feasible functional status at discharge and all patients but one were discharged home in the bridge-ECMO group.

            "text": "Although the results of this study provide additional information on short- and long-term outcomes of lung transplantation after bridging with ECMO in a relatively large sample from a prospective multicenter registry, the study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, because of the observational nature of the study, our findings remain prone to various biases. We used a national multicenter designed to improve the generalizability of our findings, but there is a potential risk of selection bias. In addition, differences in pre-transplantation status between the two groups should be considered, which might influence the clinical outcomes. Although the bridge-ECMO group was more severely ill before transplantation, however, transplantation outcomes was comparable. Second, because KOTRY was designed to collect the follow up data of lung transplantation, detailed information on the clinical status prior to ECMO, ECMO management including case selection, and rehabilitation prior to transplantation was not systematically collected. Third, KOTRY includes a large number of bridge-ECMO patients compared to other studies [26\u201328]. The high rate of bridge with ECMO in our study may reflect the Korean lung allocation system based firstly on urgency of transplant [28], which is different from the European lung allocation score system based on the expected benefit after lung transplantation as well as the disease severity. Under a medical urgency-based allocation system regardless of post-transplant survival in Korea, therefore, patients with ECMO on waiting list are given the highest priority for transplantation. However, this is what allowed a large number of lung transplant patients who underwent bridging with ECMO to be enrolled. Fourth, KOTRY is not the only source of data regarding lung transplantation in Korea. Compared with the Korean Network for Organ Sharing data, only 49% of all patients who received lung transplantation in Korea during the study period were registered in the KOTRY. Finally, KOTRY enrolls patients at the time of transplantation, and we were unable to analyze patients who died while waiting for lung transplantation while on ECMO support.",
