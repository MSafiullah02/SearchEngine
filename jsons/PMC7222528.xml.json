In all cases there was evidence of contacts with subjects infected by COVID-19. All the cases were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in nasal-pharyngeal swabs, which caused the respiratory illness COVID-19, defined as an oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air, or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 300 mmHg [11]. A total of 13 cases (52%) had history of smoking for more than 20 years. The majority of patients, 19 (76%), had several comorbidities (in particular diabetes mellitus [32%], hypertension [64%] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [28%]). The medical records of patients were analyzed by a team of oncologists, data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records. In addition, survival and overcome from infection of cancer patients COVID-19-positive were evaluated compared with a control group of patients COVID-19-positive hospitalized in the same period comparable and matched by age, sex, pneumonia and antiviral treatment.",
