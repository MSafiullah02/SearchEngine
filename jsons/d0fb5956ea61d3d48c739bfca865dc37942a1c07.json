Materials and methods In a retrospective study, data from patients after RTA by the TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae from 1993 to 2014 were evaluated for demographical and injury characteristics. The predictor variable was mechanism of injury and the outcome variables were type of injury, severity and hospital resources utilization. Results During the investigation period, n = 62,196 patients were enclosed with a prevalence of maxillofacial injuries of 20.3% (MFT positive). The injury severity score of MFT-positive patients was higher than in the MTF-negative subgroup (27 \u00b1 12.8 vs. 23.0 \u00b1 12.7). If MFT positive, 39.8% show minor, 37.1% moderate, 21.5% serious and 1.6% severe maxillofacial injuries. Injuries of the midface occurred in 60.3% of MTF-positive patients. A relevant blood loss (> 20% of total blood volume) occurred in 1.9%. MFT-positive patients had a higher coincidence with cervical spine fractures (11.3% vs. 7.8%) and traumatic brain injuries (62.6% vs. 34.8%) than MFT-negative patients. There was a noticeable decrease in the incidence of facial injuries in car/truck drivers during the study period. Conclusions Every 5th patient after RTA shows a MFT and the whole trauma team must be aware that this indicates a high prevalence of traumatic brain and cervical spine injuries. Clinical relevance Even if sole injuries of the face are seldom life threatening, maxillofacial expertise in interdisciplinary trauma centres is strongly recommended.",

Even if the introduction of seat belts and the improvement of safety systems led to a significant reduction of injury severity and death after traffic accidence, they are still one of the major causes for maxillofacial injuries in adults [2, 4] . Those injuries may result in a loss of function, disfiguration, psychological problems or even disability and death [5] . The assessment of facial injuries is often perceived as difficult by the ambulance. In particular, this is due to the fact that injuries in the maxillofacial area offer special features and that there is often a lack of subject-specific competence [6] . Nevertheless, Esmer et al. found evidence that about 25% of all severely injured patients are suffering from maxillofacial injuries as well [7] . These injuries can be less severe, such as injuries to soft tissue or teeth, or life-threatening, such as bleedings from major arteries [8] .",

Included are patients who are admitted to hospital via emergency room and subsequently receive intensive or intermediate care and patients who arrive at hospital with vital signs and die before admission to the intensive care unit. The infrastructure for documentation, data management and data analysis is provided by the Academy for Trauma Surgery, which is affiliated to the German Trauma Society. Scientific data analysis is approved according to a peer review procedure established by the Committee on Emergency Medicine, Intensive Care and Trauma Management (Sektion NIS) of the German Trauma Society. The participating hospitals are mainly located in Germany. Currently, approximately 40,000 cases from more than 600 hospitals are entered into the database per year. For hospitals associated with TraumaNetzwerk DGU\u00ae, the entry of at least a basic data set is obligatory for reasons of quality assurance [12] .

            "text": "Over a period of more than 20 years, this study covers all traffic accidents resulting in severely injured patients recorded in the TraumaRegister DGU\u00ae and represents the largest Predominance of injuries of the midface was described before whereas the mandible, even if an exposed location, was affected less commonly [8] . In accordance, Rashid et al. concluded that most mandibular fractures were associated with interpersonal violence and falls whereas the incidence of fractures associated with traffic accidents became low also reflecting improvements in car safety. Schneider et al. came to the conclusion that only 13% of maxillofacial fractures were result of traffic accidents [4, 15, 16] . Nevertheless, this seems to apply for Germany/Central Europe only as other countries reported different major causes for maxillofacial injuries [10] . The given prevalence is similar if not slightly higher to those reported by others [5, 17] whereas a recent publication showed concomitant injuries to the facial skull in about 39% of cases [8] . The injury pattern of severely injured patients after traffic accidents has changed for car/truck accidents only. For all other types of accident, the combinations of injury patterns have largely remained the same over the years. Some authors reported that accidents involving motorcycles were the most prevalent. For example, in Malaysia, motorcycle-related fatalities are reported to be three times higher than car fatalities, six times higher than pedestrian and 50 times higher than bus passenger fatalities [18] . Nevertheless, others analysed in 2008 that accidents involving automobiles were the most frequent cause [5, 17] . In the developed countries, greater prevalence of facial trauma among victims of automobile accidents than among victims of motorcycle accidents may be due to the use of airbags, which, despite reducing the incidence and severity of injuries in general, may contribute to facial injuries. In contrast to this, showing a lack of established cultural patterns [22] . The mean age of 42 years in the study at hand is similar to others [8] whereas in less recent studies, the peak was reported to be between 32 and 40 years [23, 24] . In accordance, a shift towards older patients may be assumed. Maxillofacial injuries are rarely the leading diagnosis as stabilization and warming of patients on the trauma unit is of paramount importance so facial injuries are often diagnosed later [25] . Nevertheless, they are frequently associated with major trauma of the cervical spine and the neurocranium/head. Analogue to this, a correlation between facial injuries and other injuries of the head has been described to exist in 19-30% of cases [15, 26, 27] . Tsang and Whitfield stated that in 24% of cases with craniofacial fractures, additional fractures in the base of the skull were seen [28] . This could be attributed to transfer of force from the facial skeleton to the cranium. However, some investigations have suggested that the facial skeleton may actually transmit forces directly to the neurocranium, resulting in serious brain injury. An association between injury to the upper and midfacial skeleton and varying severity of brain injury had been suggested [29, 30] . In accordance, at the latest in the trauma room, the entire patient must be re-evaluated in a priority-oriented manner in order not to endanger him or her due to initially unrecognised or underestimated injuries [31] . Though, especially in polytraumatised patients, a delay in correct diagnosis of lesions is evident in 5-14% of cases [32] . For example, the unsuspected comorbidity of the cervical spine as an infrequent but serious risk after maxillofacial injury was illustrated by a recent publication by Reich et al. underlining the results of the study at hand. From a traumatological/orthopaedic point of view, patients with cervical spine injuries present in 6-19% of cases with significant maxillofacial trauma [9, 33, 34] and the probability of a blunt spine injury seem to rise with an increased complexity of the maxillofacial injury (Fig. 3) [35] .",

            "text": "Sargent and Rogers formulated that early restoration with anatomic reduction and fixation of the midfacial fractures led to a reduction in oedema formation as well as a better recontouring of facial soft parts [36] . Scholz et al. found the least rate of complications for surgical reduction of midface fractures between the 2nd and the 8th day [37] . In contrary, other authors did not see an increase in complications when using a rather delayed approach for maxillo-facial fractures [6, 24] . Rothweiler et al. even concluded that a delayed approach (> 72 h) led to less complications [8] . Of course, events such as unstable bleeding, exposed cartilage to the nose and ear as well as intra-orbital or intra-canalicular damage to the visual pathway make a therapeutic action necessary within a few hours. In accordance, basic maxillofacial competence is recommended in all trauma centres, for example in order to immediately detect a retrobulbal hematoma and shift the patient to a centre with maxillo-facial-and/or ophthalmologic expertise as soon as possible. Here, early decompression of the orbita is one major aspect to prevent a permanent loss of function of the optical nerve with otherwise might lead to a consecutive reduced vision or even blindness [38] . Another rare but lifethreatening complication of midfacial fractures is a traumatic bleeding of the maxillary artery. This can occur directly after the trauma or delayed after rupture of a traumatic pseudoaneurysm or caused by movement of bony fragments [39] . Therefore, all emergency physicians and trauma surgeons should be aware of this complication and should be trained in stopping the bleeding by using packings, belocq tamponades or expandable local catheters until definitive open surgical ligature or interventional radiological catheter-based embolization can be performed.",

Although efforts are undertaken by the TR-DGU to increase data completeness and data correctness as well as to include all severely injured patients (e.g. regular reports of data completeness, audits of all trauma centres regarding data correctness), up to 10% of all cases likely go unreported [40] . In addition, it must be mentioned that the number of participating trauma centres increased from 5 in the year 1993 to more than 500 in 2014. Furthermore, in the beginning of the TR-DGU, Also, maxillofacial injuries might be overseen if they were not obvious. In accordance, CT scan of the midface was not always conducted in the past. Though, as several authors showed a positive integration of whole-body CT in the diagnostic assessment of trauma room patients, an increase of the respective detection over the years can be assumed [41, 42] . A further limitation of the study is the absence of details of maxillofacial injuries. Even documentation and especially coding has shown to be not reliable [43] and it can be assumed that this especially applies for maxillofacial injuries if they are primarily documented and coded by trauma surgeons. Moreover, it should be stressed that all data are limited to severely injured patients who arrived alive the emergency department and were treated by a multidisciplinary trauma team.",

The percentage of facial injuries suffered by motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians has barely changed over the years (Fig. 6a). Because of the significant reduction of facial injuries in the group of car/truck drivers, the anatomical regions of the facial injuries were separately analysed for this group. The midfacial injuries decreased from 15.2% of 3108 cases in the years 1993-2001 to 11.9% of 6972 cases in 2002-2008 and 10.6% of 18718 cases in the years 2009-2014. After an increasing incidence of mandibular injuries from 6.9% in the years 1993-2001 to 8.2% in 2002-2008, a marked decline to 2.9% in the latest period of the years 2009-2014 could be recognised. Another reduction could be proven by the incidence of mouth injuries from 2.2% of in the years 1993-2001 to 2.0% in 2002-2008 and 1.3% in the years 2009-2014.",
