The disease emerged in late 2002, when an outbreak of atypical pneumonia began in Guangdong Province, China. It subsequently spread across the world via major air routes, reaching 29 countries on five continents. This international spread began when a doctor who had treated patients in China arrived in Hong Kong on Feb 21, 2003. His 1-day stay in a hotel led to infection of 15 others who carried the infection to hospitals within Hong Kong and in Vietnam, Canada, Singapore, the USA, the Philippines, and Australia. This rapid international spread prompted WHO to issue the first global alert on March 12. 3 days later, a Singaporean doctor who had treated some of the first patients in Singapore developed symptoms while attending a medical conference in New York, USA. During his return journey, he was quarantined and admitted to hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. The causative agent was unknown at that time.1\n",

Three factors led to intense discussions between senior WHO epidemiologists and the agency's Director-General: that the disease had emerged in southern China, an area from which many epidemiologists expected the next influenza pandemic to originate; that it caused outbreaks of a severe unidentified atypical pneumonia with respiratory failure within Asia and was spreading to North America and Europe; and finally that hospital workers particularly seemed to be at risk. But questions of the unknown dominated the discussions, not these facts. Was the syndrome caused by an infectious agent? If it was infectious, would it spread from health workers to their families and communities, or had it already done so? Were there asymptomatic infections? Could it sustain transmission indefinitely, and could it become endemic in people or become enzootic in animals leading to a constant threat of re-emergence in human beings?",

The disease was spreading by face-to-face contact, probably through coughing and sneezing and possibly by fomites. Antivirals and antibiotics were not curative. Through a virtual network of laboratories coordinated by WHO with teleconferences and secure websites, the causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus on March 22, 2003, and a diagnostic test was quickly developed.3, 4\n",

For a respiratory disease, SARS was unusual in that transmission was low in the first 5 days of illness and peaked with increasing disease severity. This pattern of transmission allowed the disease to be contained by public health measures alone. However, the fact that transmissibility was greatest when illness was most severe contributed to the high proportion of secondary infections in health workers, who accounted for 1706 (21%) of 8096 cases reported.2 The remaining infections occurred in chains of transmission from household and community contacts.2\n",
