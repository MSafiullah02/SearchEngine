There has been a growing body of literature on mixed-order transitions (MOTs), which qualify as both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions depending on the chosen order parameter. Such transitions appear in many different contexts, such as DNA unzipping [1\u20133], Ising spins with long-range interactions [4], and various percolation models with biased merger of clusters [5]. A common aspect of these systems is the existence of long-range interactions which encourage global ordering over a finite fraction of the system at criticality [4].",

If each transmission occurs independently without synergy, the cascade exhibits a continuous percolation transition [18]. In contrast, with sufficiently strong synergy, the transition can be a MOT: a continuous transition of the probability of a global cascade coincides with a discontinuous jump of the cascade size. Moreover, the lines of MOTs and purely continuous transitions join at a tricritical point (TCP) with its own critical properties [19]. Again, the long loops of the substrate, through which different spreading pathways cross each other, facilitate global cascades at the MOTs [8,11].",

In homogeneous structures, such as lattices [6,7,13\u201315], Poissonian random networks [6\u20138,10\u201313,17], and modular networks [16], a MOT requires sufficiently strong synergy between two spreaders and dimension greater than two [13,14]. However, cascades typically occur on heterogeneous structures: for instance, social networks feature a significant fraction of highly connected individuals called hubs, whose existence is typically modeled by scale-free networks (SFNs) with a power-law distribution pk\u223ck\u2212\u03b1 (with \u03b1>2) of the number of neighbors k (called degree) [20]. Since SFNs with a greater variance of k contain more loops [21], \u03b1 can be a major determinant of the conditions for MOTs. For cooperative contagions on SFNs, a heterogeneous mean-field approach [9] showed that a discontinuous jump of the cascade size is possible for \u03b1>3 given sufficiently strong synergy, but not for 2<\u03b1<3; however, whether the same statement holds for general kinds of synergy remains to be clarified.",

As empirically observed [22], social reinforcement induces a large boost in the spread of a behavior if the target individual has sufficiently many adjacent spreaders. As a simple model incorporating this feature, we study the generalized epidemic process (GEP) with the synergy threshold\nn\u22652, in which the spreading probability changes when the number of spreading neighbors is greater than or equal to n, extending the original version limited to n=2\n[13]. In the sense that the cluster is formed by a mixture of single-node and multinode mechanisms, our model can be considered a cascading-process analog of the heterogeneous k-core percolation [23], which is a pruning process. We analytically show that, for 2<\u03b1<4, an abundance of hubs enable MOTs for arbitrarily large n\u22652. In contrast to cooperative contagions, the cascade size exhibits a discontinuous jump even for 2<\u03b1<3 in a manner similar to the abrupt appearance of a giant heterogeneous k core with k\u22653 on the same SFNs [23]. While the near-TCP scaling exponents for \u03b1>3 remain identical to those of cooperative contagions [9], a new set of exponents can be identified for 2<\u03b1<3.",

            "text": "Analytic calculation of r. In contrast to P\u221e, r depends on \u03bc as the crossing of spreading pathways is nonnegligible whenever r>0. Here we present a calculation of the dependence based on a standard tree ansatz for random SFNs [24]. For this aim, we consider the probability q that a node at an end of a randomly chosen link is R after the spread has stopped. For simplicity, we assume km\u2265n\u22122, which does not affect the main results. Then q satisfies a self-consistency equation q=f(q), where\n(2)f(q)\u22611\u2212\u2211k=km\u221epk\u2032\u2211m=0k\u22121k\u22121m(1\u2212\u03bb)min[m,n\u22121]\u00d7(1\u2212\u03bc)max[0,m\u2212n+1]qm(1\u2212q)k\u22121\u2212m\u2211m=0k\u22121.Each summand indexed by m on the right-hand side accounts for the probability that the node has m nodes among k\u22121 neighbors (excluding the neighbor at the other end of the randomly chosen link) trying to spread the behavior to it, all of which fail to do so. Note that pk\u2032\u2261kpk/\u2329k\u232a is the degree distribution of a node at the end of a path, weighted by k because higher-degree nodes are more likely to be connected. Once q is known, we can calculate r by\n(3)r=1\u2212\u2211k=km\u221epk\u2211m=0kkm(1\u2212\u03bb)min[m,n\u22121]\u00d7(1\u2212\u03bc)max[0,m\u2212n+1]qm(1\u2212q)k\u2212m\u2211m=0k,where pk appears instead of pk\u2032 because all nodes have equal weights regardless of k in the definition of r. For any parameters, Eqs. (2) and (3) provide an exact, albeit implicit, solution for r. Examples are shown in Fig.  1(b) for the GEP with n=3 on the SFNs with km=4.",

We note that the latter gets an extra factor of lnq for the special cases where \u03b1 is an integer, which leads to some complications (see [25] for more details). The transition type is determined by whether q=f(q) has a positive root at \u03bb=\u03bbc, which in turn depends on the sign of f\u00af\u2032\u2032\u2261limq\u21930f\u2032\u2032(q). If f\u00af\u2032\u2032>0 (f\u00af\u2032\u2032<0), a positive root exists (cannot exist), and the transition of r is discontinuous (continuous). Applying this criterion to Eq.

This regime is where the cascades of the GEP differ most significantly from those of cooperative contagions [9]. In the latter, a node should first be infected by one contagion with probability \u03bb to experience a secondary infection with probability \u03bc, so r=0 whenever \u03bb=0. In the GEP, even if \u03bb=0, a spreading event by \u03bc can still occur because it only requires sufficiently many exposures to neighboring spreaders.

All analytical results, based on the tree ansatz (2), are in good agreement with the numerics beyond the regime of strong finite-size effects. It is found that the hub-driven MOTs occur only for \u03b1<4. In particular, for 2<\u03b1<3, we identified new transition behaviors stemming from the convergence of loops at the hubs. These imply that the spread of behavior and cooperative contagions [9] belong to different universality classes on typical social networks. Our results reveal fundamental principles underlying the formation of compact cultural subgroups fostered by the fat-tailed degree distribution of social networks. Interesting topics for future studies include the conditions for double phase transitions, the nature of finite-size effects, and connections to MOTs and TCPs reported in other percolation models [27,28].",
