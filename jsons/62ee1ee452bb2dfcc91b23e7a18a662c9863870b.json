My survey is not exhaustive. But it covers the theories most frequently offered by the scientifi c and environmentalist communities and the ones that are most robust, in my judgment. Also, I would say that these constitute a suffi ciently diverse sample to give a good general sense of how suitable a peg biodiversity might be for hanging environmental or natural value. 1 As prelude to this survey, I bound the discussion by recalling where biodiversity fi ts with respect to some other candidates for environmental \"goods\": Biodiversity does not have to do with individual organisms except insofar as individuals contribute to genomic diversity. But the usual arguments for the good of individual (nonhuman) organisms that hinge on an individual's rationality, consciousness, sentience, desires, needs, or the individual's \"good of its own\" offer no obvious support for the good of the diversity of rational, conscious, sentient, needy, or telic organisms. Any moral consideration afforded to individual organisms by dint of one or another of the aforementioned capabilities does not obviously extend to the diversity of individuals that possess these capabilities. One might suppose that a diversity of creatures 2 is required to make possible a diversity of kinds of rationality, consciousness, sentience, etc. For example, human sentience, crotaline sentience, formacid sentience,", "cite_spans": [{"start": 439, "end": 440, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Theories of Biodiversity Value 1 Among other theories of biodiversity value that I omit are ones that build on religious beliefs. Three reasons, not out-of-hand dismissiveness, guided this choice. First, insofar as various western religions fi nd grounds for a just-so model of biodiversity, I do, in fact, deal with a salient element of their position. On the other hand, I think that other, mostly eastern religions do not view biodiversity in anything like the way that western-trained scientists and environmentalists discuss it and which is the main topic of this book. Finally, I feel that a fair treatment of any religious approach would require a substantial opening out of this already substantial book, which puts such a treatment beyond its scope. 2 With the possible exception of the possession of a telos , these considerations are predominantly geared towards promoting the moral status of a small proper subset of organisms -a select group of multicellular animals -while demoting the status of the vast majority of (all other) organisms. and so on are possible only with some diverse complement of creatures (people, pit vipers, and ants) that possess these various forms of sentience.

The good of a species is notoriously diffi cult to rationalize, since with few exceptions, there is no obvious sense in which a species leads a purposive existence in the sense that is commonly taken as requisite for grounding the value of a species' individuals. 3 But that diffi culty is also irrelevant to the question of how biodiversity gets its value because the good of any particular species as the species that it is, like the good of individual organisms, lies outside the domain of concern for biodiversity insofar as it consists of the diversity of species. Of course, the loss of any particular species does constitute a loss -an incremental one -in species diversity. It might also constitute (more than the loss of a single individual of that species) a loss in allelic diversity, in feature diversity, or in functional diversity.

At the lower bound, zero biodiversity means no people -not a recommended option. Just considering bare human survival (and leaving aside other needs and desires), it seems safe to say that some suffi cient, nonzero amount of biodiversity is infi nitely valuable for what seems to be its essential instrumental role in ensuring the continuation of at least one particular species -Homo sapiens . 4 Yet even that \"safe\" assumption comes with caveats. It is diffi cult to know what that suffi cient amount might be -a topic that Sect. 6.4 (Biodiversity as (human) life sustainer) explores. In fact, the amount might be impossible to determine, except by fatal experiment -especially if the boundary between adequate and fatal is thin and almost impossible to perceive on approach.

A good of the former type competes with other, similar complementary goods, whose realization is sometimes mutually exclusive. A good of the latter type has a provisional quality because, as with any good that is good only as a means to an end, its value is contingent on the absence of other means or their inferiority. 6 Finally (for this chapter's prefatory remarks), so far as I can tell, there is no a priori reason for why every category of diversity that fi gures into biodiversity should be valuable; and this supposition could well turn out to be false. The diversity of species might, in fact, be of little consequence while the diversity of orders is really important according to some norm. Or Daniel Faith might be right and what really only counts is phylogenetic diversity. In short, it is possible that the diversity of kinds in some categories is valuable while diversity in others is not.

Glossing over this distinction does not compromise my discussion in this section, though it can become critically important in the context of sophisticated economic analysis. The economic reckoning of future goods can involve such niceties as their discounting or (as discussed in Sect. 6.9 , Biodiversity options) wrapping them in the complexities of option value.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 167, "text": "( 1991 , 760)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biodiversity as Resource"}, {"text": "Confusion between particular species and the diversity of species is immediately evident in the representation of biodiversity as resource.

There remains an apparent assumption that the resourceproviding organisms are a random sample of all organisms. This is almost certainly untrue and I return to this matter of fact shortly. But putting this objection aside (and alongside the previously noted category confusion), this is still a singularly unconvincing defense of the value of species diversity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biodiversity as Resource"}, {"text": "The fact is that an extraordinarily tiny minority of organisms has benefi ted humanity as resource, now and previously. The majority of this minorityespecially when it comes to food (which I discuss just below) and medicine (which I discuss in Sect. 6.5.1 ) -are highly likely to persist even in the face of a general decline in biodiversity. Furthermore, there is little reason to believe that this circumstance will change in the future. These facts combine with the other that any economic resource competes with other economic demands. As a consequence, from an economic point of view (which includes both resource and \"service\" value, the topic of Sect. 6.3 , Biodiversity as service provider), there is scarcely ever justifi cation for not letting a species go extinct -even if the effort or cost required to save it is minimal. Certainly, many if not most of the symbolic creatures -such as Ursus maritimus (polar bear) and Eubalaena spp. (right whales) -fall into this category. When, as in the case of both these creatures, there is, in fact, a signifi cant economic cost to saving them -for polar bears, reversing climate warming, 7 for right whales, slowing down or rerouting the ships that traverse their thoroughfares -then the mere possibility of a future benefi t from their incremental contribution to species diversity is an essentially nil \"expected net present value\" (to use the standard economic jargon) by comparison. Daniel Faith joins other conservation biologists in supposing that biodiversity as a resource has (positive) option value . But demonstrating that requires showing that biodiversity commands a premium over its expected value to consumers, which standard it already fails to meet. Where Faith leaves off with option value, James Maclaurin and Kim Sterelny pick up. I take up their treatment of this theory of biodiversity value in Sect. 6.9 (Biodiversity options). 8 There is yet another objection to the resource rationale. Insofar as conserving biodiversity preserves the likelihood of conserving one or more valuable resources in the future, it also preserves the likelihood of conserving creatures that are destructive of resources or otherwise harmful. Disease organisms, \"pests\", and destructive parasites contribute to biodiversity (or at least species diversity) at least as much as (and possibly much more than), for example, the trees that provide good building materials. In fact, because parasitism might well be the predominant \"lifestyle\" on the planet -by some estimates, outnumbering free-living species by a factor of four (Stiling 2002 , 193 ) -conserving biodiversity is far more likely to ensure that parasitic creatures continue to be in good supply. Parasites even come with a diversity bonus -namely, the species on which they are parasitic (their hosts). Polyphagous parasites deliver multiple bonuses. 9 In addition, and contrary to the random sample assumption, food for people -the most essential of resources for humans -is actually supplied by organisms in a set that is vanishingly small in the total (species) diversity picture, and that predominantly are carefully maintained and managed by humans on farms. Reliable recent estimates (Khoshbakht and Hammer 2008 ) are that there are around 7,000 cultivated 7 In May 2009, the Obama administration in the United States reaffi rmed the preceding (George W. Bush) administration's position that the Endangered Species Act, as applied to polar bear, is not a basis for curbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are the root cause of that species' demise. See Revkin ( 2009 ) . The rationale, supplied by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, was largely economic (in terms of the impacts on cement manufacturing and regulatory diffi culties) -though it is not at all clear that the ESA admits this sort of test as legitimate. 8 Faith ( 2007 ) seems to regard mere mention of \"option value\" as suffi cient to counter current uncertainty regarding what value biodiversity might have, either as resource or service. Unfortunately, he ignores the wider economic picture: Uncertainty in biodiversity supply, uncertainty in biodiversity demand, and expected consumer surplus heavily infl uenced by the relative certainty of savings realized by avoiding the cost of conservation can easily push (garden-variety) option value into negative territory. 9 Of course, people like some parasites -such as the wasps that pollinate commercially valuable Ficus trees. 6.2 Biodiversity as Resource crop species of plants. That is only about 2% of the estimated 320,000 kinds of plants on earth (according to Spicer 2006 , 27) . 10 Yet that percentage is enormous in comparison to that represented by the number of livestock species. There are an estimated 7,600 breeds (in the 2006 Global Databank for Farm Animal Genetic Resources of the FAO -the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) of perhaps 40 species. 11 The contribution of these creatures to species diversity borders on infi nitesimal in the context of over 9 million other animal species. 12 A similar consideration applies to biodiversity as medicinal resource, which Sect. 6.5.1 (Biodiversity as pharmacopoeia) takes up in detail.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1904, "end": 1905, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2579, "end": 2598, "text": "(Stiling 2002 , 193", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2866, "end": 2867, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3278, "end": 3279, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4354, "end": 4355, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4602, "end": 4619, "text": "Spicer 2006 , 27)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4622, "end": 4624, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4923, "end": 4925, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5064, "end": 5066, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biodiversity as Resource"}, {"text": "One fi nal consideration might be the most devastating for the argument for biodiversity as food resource: There is perhaps no better understood and no greater confl ict involving biodiversity than the one between it and the production of food. Food production involving crops or tended livestock takes land away from the many other creatures that might otherwise live on it. Chopping or burning down a forest to put the soil under the plow is the most common source of \"habitat conversion\". That is the euphemistic term for the phenomenon that scientists routinely cite as, by far, the single most decisive force in the global reduction of biodiversity. 13 And agriculture dominates the three leading causes of habitat destruction or \" conversion\" -which also (Dirzo and Raven 2003 , 159) include \"extraction activities (mining, fi shing, logging, and harvesting), and the development of infrastructure (such as human settlements, industry, roads, dams, and power lines).\" 14 Empirical support for the confl ict between biodiversity and food for humans is reinforced at a macro level by the \" species-area effect\", or as Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson ( 1963 ) put it in their seminal paper, \"the fauna-area curve\". MacArthur 10 Dirzo and Raven ( 2003 , 142, 159) note that estimates of the number of fl owering plants (the angiosperms which dominate the plant world) range from 250,000 to more than 500,000 species. 11 This fi gure is due to Drucker et al. ( 2005 , 11) , who give a lower estimate than the FAO's for the number of breeds, though agree with the FAO's fi gure for the number of livestock species. 12 Agroecologists have lately stressed the prudence of maintaining some greater rather than lesser variety of strains of agriculturally important plants and breeds of agriculturally important animals. But they are talking varieties of plants and animals in the hundreds or at most a few thousands. These are created and maintained as domesticated organisms, and unlikely to be much affected even by a great extinction event. Insofar as wild species are thought to be needed for future crop plant varieties, seeds (along with other ex situ methods of conservation) serve quite well. Kew Garden's Millenial Seed Bank alone projects having one-fourth of all wild plant species represented in their seed bank by 2020 ( http://www.kew.org/ucm/groups/public/documents/document/ ppcont_016021.pdf ). 13 See, for example, Sala et al. (2000, 1771) , who summarize their fi ndings on \"drivers\" of biodiversity loss in their Tables 6.1 and 6.2. 14 The numbers cited by Dirzo and Raven come from the year 2000 Red List of Threatened Species due to the World Conservation Union, Gland Switzerland (IUCN) . See also the discussion of \"land transformation\" in Vitousek et al. ( 1997 , 494-495) . and Wilson originally proposed this principle, which posits a positive relationship between species richness and land area (proportional to a fractional exponent of the area), in the context of island biogeography. But the correlation has been found to hold in a wide range of different ecosystems, making it one of the more generally applicable and most highly verifi ed principles in ecology. These days, great effort is devoted to fi nding ways to \"de-intensify\" the use of land given over for the production of food. There is much talk about ecologically less destructive agricultural practices and systems. 15 But \"less destructive\" means \"still very destructive, indeed\".

But this barely registers in the balance of biodiversity after the existing fl ora of a large swath of land is ripped out (which also rips out dependent fauna) and replaced by a set of food crops that is considerably less diverse (even when those crops are highly diverse by agroecological standards). Moreover, the opportunities for accommodating local organisms are limited by the fact that almost all agricultural crops everywhere are exotics whose interaction (benefi cial or otherwise) with local organisms is uncertain. And many crops do not require insect pollinators. 16 This clarifi cation owes to a challenge made by Jeffrey Lockwood. This setup merits two observations.

For some time, this view has been the gold standard for at least two of the three world's largest transnational so-called \"conservation\" mega-organizations -The Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund. In 2009, the third of the three \"conservation\" mega-organizations -Conservation International -joined the ecosystem services fold. Many large corporations express their enthusiasm for this approach by sponsoring these dominant organizations. 17 It is both easy and revealing to understand why corporations welcome the proposition that what really counts in ecosystems is their services, and that biodiversity counts precisely insofar as it contributes to these services. This guiding principle provides an apparently environmental justifi cation for the most commercially profi table environment-and ecosystem-altering activities. The imprimatur and public presence of TNC, WWF, and CI serve to defl ect questions of the principle's environmental credibility. 18 Unfortunately, as I will show, the implications for the environment in general and biodiversity in particular are, by most any standard, entirely unattractive, if not devastating, to nature and its value. 19 The ecosystem-services view of natural value is built atop two exculpating principles that grant permission to activities that impinge on the environment. According to the fi rst and most basic principle, if the activity does not compromise some one or more identifi ed services, then the activity is environmentally permissible. According to the second principle, if the fi rst principle does not apply because an ecosystem service is compromised or removed, then the activity is still permitted -provided that there is an alternative way to provide that service. The alternative service provider is allowed to be another ecosystem constructed specifi cally for that purpose. But the logic of ecosystem services does not require that a surrogate be a re-creation in any way other than in a capability to render the service. 20 In both principle and practice, the engineering details are left open. 17 I sometimes use scare quotes for the word \"conservation\" (and sometimes utilize the term \"neo-conservation\") in reference to these organizations as well as to allied practices that are increasingly mainstream in conservation biology. The scare in these quotes has to do with the fact that conservation, as these parties understand it, has much to do with managing and developing the planet for the production of stuff, services, and a few creature that excite the public, biologists, hunters, or fi shers. It has little to do with what one might have thought to be the core meaning of \"conservation\" as \"preserving the natural world\". 18 See Note 25 for more on the relationship between TNC and the international mining giant Rio Tinto. 19 Those who bet nature on its provision of ecosystem services nevertheless try to weasel out of the terrible implications of a consistent application of their own principles by suggesting the ecosystem-service argument is merely a trump card, which can be pulled out when the need arises. I point out in this section that this is an arbitrary and therefore illegitimate move. Section 8.2.3 (\"Living from\" nature, uniqueness, and modal robustness) provides a more complete perspective, from which one can see that this card is pulled from a house of cards. 20 The position set out by the three major \"conservation\" organizations (and others) is actually more radical than my description in the main text suggests. The added radicalization derives from the principles of \"mitigation banking\" and \"habitat banking\", which justify any action that compromises an environmental service on the mere promise that the identifi ed, affected service will be restored somehow or other and this will be done someplace or other . There is a fairly uniformly bad track record in actually making \"withdrawals\" on banked mitigation efforts and banked habitats. But whether or not promises tend to be kept in actual practice, there remains the serious normative question of whether or legitimate norms concerning the value of nature justify the destruction of a natural habitat in exchange for the promise to reinstate a service or two. So far as species diversity is concerned, the fi rst exculpating principle essentially says that an organism's value depends on its ability to pay its own way as an indispensable contributor to a valuable ecosystem service that is not otherwise more effi ciently provided. It is important to notice that this is an extraordinarily high standard for a species to meet in order to justify itself. It requires that some valued service would not be robustly maintained in the species' absence.

But this is hardly a vindication of ecosystem service principles of valuation. For it is often fairly clear that, even when biodiversity is not an obstacle to an ecosystem service, it fails to pitch in; and that, according to those evaluative principles, makes its removal permissible. 21 Still, most ecosystem dis services have to do with how ecosystem properties negatively impinge on other kinds of valuable services. Vociferous opposition to listing many if not most candidates for \"endangered\" under the Endangered Species Act arises precisely on the grounds of obstructing economically valuable services. This was behind Alaska Governor Sarah Palin's announcement (Bryson 2009 ) that the state of Alaska would sue to have the endangered Cook Inlet population of belugas delisted. 22 Cook Inlet is an area where exploding gas and oil development has spurred planning to expand the port of Anchorage and possibly build a new bridge, the Knik Arm version of the \"Bridge to Nowhere\" across the Inlet. The beluga swims -at a typically unhurried 3-9 kph -squarely in the way of the services that promise substantial increases in economic welfare. Whatever small economic benefi t the little white whale contributes derives mainly from the amusement it affords people in marine \"parks\". So far as Palin and most Alaskans are concerned, the whales should stay there and clear of the development of vastly greater economic goods in the Cook Inlet. There it is unequivocally an economic liability. 23 After Palin quit her job as governor later in 2009, Anchorage mayor Dan Sullivan joined with several other local mayors to take up the cause of litigating the delisting 21 I am indebted to Jeffrey Lockwood for a remark that forced me to clarify this point. 22 The suit was eventually fi led, as reported by Joling ( 2010 ) . 23 This commentary is derived from an online version, available at http://environmentalvalues. blogspot.com/2009/01/beluga-isnt-that-caviar.html . of the Cook Inlet belugas. Like Palin, they made their case squarely on the grounds that the large mammals impede (non-ecosystem) services such as the transportation of oil by ship and effi cient vehicular transportation of people across Cook Inlet. The belugas' disservice consists in the fact (Hunter 2009 ) that they \"could have big negative effects on government projects and activities in and near the Inlet, as well as fi sheries and oil and gas development.\" These anti-beluga partisans do not challenge the service framework for assessing values.

This leads to the recently popularized notion that \"biodiversity banking\", \"biodiversity offsets\", or \"biodiversity development\" 25 can ensure \"no net loss\" of biodiversity; and this is considered quite separately from the question of maintaining services. Nevertheless, \"no net loss\" tends to be rationalized via the fi ctional ability of people to create a duplicate habitat from whole cloth. It makes Creators out of ecosystem engineers, who populate their Creation with the appropriate complement of bio-parts. Though the Creators of this Creation relieve the bio-parts of service-rendering expectations, they breathe into them another expectation. These bio-parts are supposed to coalesce with the abiotic bits into something recognizable as \"the same\" as the developed-out-of-existence home of their sacrifi ced brethren. 26 The second and more recent response takes off in the opposite direction, to presume a tight bi directional link between ecosystem services and biodiversity. 25 The term \"biodiversity development\" and its unblinking usage as one type among others of economic development might sound like fi ction to someone not inoculated with the serum of Natural Capitalism. Sadly, it is not my invention, but rather a quite real touchstone of current-day conservation. See The Nature Conservancy Leadership Council ( 2008 ) (which features a presentation by Rio Tinto's manager of biodiversity offsets) and Richards ( 2005 ) .

This is made possible by such organizations as The Nature Conservancy, which, while receiving donations from Rio Tinto, eagerly supplies and endorses the \"conservation\" rationale for that company's extraction practices. Because this topic crosses the boundary that circumscribes \"biodiversity as service provider\", I will not pursue it here. This is supposed to make it essentially unnecessary to distinguish the two for purposes of conservation. Not only is biodiversity said to have value as a means of ensuring ecosystem services, but also it is said that \"conserving\" ecosystem services is among the surest means of conserving biodiversity. In fact, it is said that focusing on ecosystem services better ensures that biodiversity is conserved than trying to conserve biodiversity directly -that is, with biodiversity specifi cally in mind as the goal. 27 In effect, this response simply denies, without accompanying reasons for denying, that biodiversity fails to track ecosystem service levels.

One counterexample is perhaps the classic textbook example of the salt mash -a relatively species-impoverished type of ecosystem that is often highlighted as a service provider. These habitats, dominated by naturally occurring (not human-designed) monocultures of Spartina and Juncus and a few other salient species (mollusks and others) provide (for example) water-fi ltering services. 28 It does not appear that more species must be recruited to get this job done. A second counterexample or class of counterexamples is provided by exotic species, which, more often than not, are \"experiments\" in increased biodiversity at local and regional scales.

Subsequently, coffee prices plummeted and the fi elds were replanted with pineapple, which does not benefi t from bee pollinators. The bees were thus put out of work. Their service value, as well as the service value of the peripheral forest that housed them, thereby plummeted to zero. See Ricketts et al. ( 2004 ) for the fi rst part of this story. There has been considerably less fanfare surrounding the story's conclusion. See also Note 38 in Chap. 8 and Sect. 8.2.3 (\"Living from\" nature, uniqueness, and modal robustness) for the broader signifi cance of this story. 33 It is worth noting that this case is representative of ones in which hard work earns a reprieve from derogation as an \"alien\": A. mellifera is exotic in North America. species or the diversity of anything else. Consider that an enormous portion of the world's productivity -including the production of perhaps one-fi fth of the world's atmospheric oxygen -can be credited to species of the single genus Prochlorococcus -chlorophyll b-containing marine cyanobacteria.

I now return to the several respects in which classifying \"properties\" as services or disservices is highly problematic, mentioned in connection with David Tilman's grassland experiments. One way to characterize the problem is as a certain porosity in the containers that ostensibly compartmentalize kinds of service, and even that separate services from disservices. A radical compartmental leakage occurs because the same kind of function can have (positive) value in one context and disvalue in another. Nutrient retention and nitrogen fi xation can be services when agriculture is served by fertilization effi ciency. But these are viewed as disservices when they impinge on the success of favored plants and other organisms whose adaptive advantage derives from their ability to thrive in nitrogen-impoverished soils. 34 Pollination services might be pollination disservices when what is pollinated is considered a noxious weed. Weed control services, provided by an arthropod herbivore on noxious plants, can be food production disservices when applied to farm crops. In fact, the \"noxious weed\" and \"farm crop\" can, in different places, be one and the same species. They can even be one and the same plant in the same place.

The fact is that many functions in the human-coveted set -that is, many services -derive from relatively non-diverse landscapes.

However in and of itself, productivity is really of no value to humanity. This is easily seen by reference to the many plants that people classify as weeds. Some of them, such as kudzu in the southeastern United States, are enormously productive.

Unfortunately, discussions of how stability relates to biodiversity have a strong tendency to forgo logical consistency in favor of normative commentary. 39 The fi rst thing to note about the stability of ecosystems is that there is no known general positive or negative correlation of this property to any kind of diversity -including species diversity. 40 Moreover, it's hard to know what service is implied by stability, other than that of preserving the status quo . 37 See, for example, Mazumder ( 2009 , 143-157). 38 Nor have marine biologists whom I've contacted been able or willing to point to evidence for the thesis that eutrophication reduces biodiversity overall.

So the anti-immigrant sentiment seems antithetical to a purely biodiversity-valuing point of view. 43 But aside from that, there are many contexts in which people value, not immigration resistance, but immigration acceptance. Fish and game managers routinely introduce species (particularly fi sh) to satisfy interests in (mostly) recreational predation. 44 Ironically, biologists intent on controlling previous, recent immigrants, introduce immigrants -known as \"biological controls\" -of their own. 41 Those familiar with the history of ecology will recognize this as a restatement of the eminent English ecologist Charles Elton's (Elton 1958 , 145) famous richness-stability hypothesis: \u2026 the balance of relatively simple communities of plants and animals is more easily upset than richer ones. 42 The phrase \"the rich get richer\" is stolen from the title of the paper by Stohlgren et al.

This type of theological argument is slowly but inexorably eroded by progressively more and more satisfying scientifi c explanations. Similarly, as science advances beyond the relative ignorance presumed by Hooper and colleagues, it will explain in greater and greater detail what minimally diverse biological elements need be retained to provide coveted services. That knowledge will enable a more and more \"effi cient\" use of biodiversity. This will progressively diminish the service value of any great amount of biodiversity, which will be seen as more and more superfl uous and more and more a barrier to progress.

Thus, in a number of cases in Southeast Asia and Amazonia, wholesale removal of trees has favored Anopheles spp. over the previous, more benign mosquito residents. The newcomers are more effective transmitters of the more virulent species of malarial Plasmodium (genus) parasites (Molyneux et al. 2008 , 295-296). Similarly, the removal of trees in Cameroon has shifted the balance from one snail species, Bulinus forskalii , which hosts a relatively nonvirulent schistosome (a trematode), to B. truncatus , which effectively hosts Schistosoma haematobium .

Perhaps the lesson is that care must be taken in how deforestation is carried out, with particular attention given to installing proper drainage systems.

It is this relative reduction in predators and larger competitors of Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) that is said to have produced a surge in populations of that small rodent. As it happens, P. leucopus is also an especially competent reservoir of Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme spirochete bacterium.

This fact connects back to the prequel story, which reveals reforestation to be a prior cause of Lyme disease in the U.S. northeast. Research suggests that, at the root, the real culprits are the acorns of Quercus spp. (northeastern oaks). Ecologist Clive Jones and his colleagues found that populations of I. scapularis surged eightfold in acorn-rich plots, perhaps as the result of the deer spending more time enjoying the repast in acorn-rich environs. Densities of P. leucopus also surged with the abundance of mast, as did their Lyme infection rates in this tick-rich environment (Jones et al. 1998 (Jones et al. , 1024 (Jones et al. -1025 . With this, the risk of human infection also increases. Applying the logic of convenience that infects the standard narrative to this more complete narrative might lead to the conclusion that Quercus spp. are bad for human health. This logic would target those grand trees for extirpation in areas where they nourish the nonhuman hosts that put humans at risk for Lyme disease. In fact, because they do not move and are slow growing, oak trees would be easier targets for extermination than deer, mice, or ticks. This consideration combines with the economic bonanza of valuable building material to make it likely that the removal of oaks is the most economically effi cient means of reducing Lyme risk to humans in the U.S. northeast. I cite one other example of the planting of native vegetation that has led to disease outbreaks: In several Mediterranean countries, including the southern Jordan Valley, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis surged as the result of planting native Chenopods (plants in the goosefoot family). The newly vegetated landscapes provided good homes for both rodent hosts -Psammomys obesus (sand rat) and Meriones tristrami (Tristram's Jird, on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ), and the phlebotomine sandfl y vectors for protozoan parasites in the genus Leishmania . This \"biodiversity\" was unwelcome and led to the uprooting of the recently reintroduced plants and the destruction of the rodents' burrows (Rapport et al. 2009 , 50) . 80 The habitat modifi cation, in turn, led to the reduction of the cutaneous leishmaniasis.

The cycle starts with a free-swimming ciliated miracidium, which enters a mollusk, where the miracidium produces sac-like sporocysts and possibly rediae, the embryonic form. These latter mature into cercaria -the larval form with a swimming tail, which propels it into a second host -typically another mollusk, a copepod, or a vertebrate carnivore (amphibian, fi sh, bird, or mammal). It develops into an adult there, or possibly within yet a third host. A third host is typically a vertebrate carnivore, which receives its unwanted visitor by eating the second host. The trematode cannot survive the extirpation of any one of its specialized host species. 81 But clearly, the fi nal vertebrate host, which could be H. sapiens , would be healthier for the absence of any of the trematode's upstream hosts.

Each of these multiple factors must be added to the already non-trivial epidemiology that describes a simple one pathogen/one host system. For each host, the epidemiological equations must take into account its rate of recovery, mortality, and whether or not (or to what degree) recovery removes an individual from the pool of susceptible individuals. Changes in any one of these many factors, and even the precise sequence in which the changes occur can affect human infection rates, and whether they increase or decrease.

If the prey species is a pathogen host, this can increase rates of encounter between infected and susceptible host individuals, thereby providing a larger and more fertile breeding ground for the pathogen. 2. A new species is a food resource or a mutualist for a nonhuman disease host or vector, leading to a more robust population of a key infectious agent. 3. A new host species is a far more competent reservoir for a disease than any host previously present, leading to far higher incidence of the pathogen or parasite in vectors that transmit it to people.

However, I believe their treatment of the \"value\" question is infl uenced by and very likely partly derailed by building the value into the \"what\". According them (Maclaurin and Sterelny 2008 , 174), the concept of biodiversity is based on species richness (so far, so good), which \"\u2026 has to be elaborated in different ways for different biological purposes\". With \"biological purpose\", Maclaurin and Sterelny are not referring to some \"creative design\". Rather, they quite straightforwardly mean, \"the purpose of a biological investigator trying to establish some ecological relationship\". But this, in turn, means that biodiversity is whatever a biological researcher would like it to mean, so that an ecological relationship established in the research can be said to be about biodiversity. While this in no way trivializes the research or its results, it does seem to trivialize the concept of biodiversity as the basis for a sweeping norm. 102 Although Maclaurin and Sterelny omit quotation marks and a citation, their defi nition of option value is, word for word, that of van Kooten and Bulte ( 2000 , 295). 6.9 Biodiversity Options First, it is couched in terms of a premium over \"[an amenity's] current value in consumption\". Although some economists presume that this \"premium\" must be positive, others show how, in fact, it can be negative, positive, or undefi ned; and moreover, that it can be negative even with risk-averse individuals. Calling an amount of money that you would demand in compensation \"a premium\", which implies an amount you might be willing to pay, prejudices the discussion. Second, the \"premium\" is, in fact, relative to expected consumer surplus. Expected consumer surplus is not (as supposed in the above defi nition) the \"current value\", but rather the expected value of future consumption. 103 Third, their defi nition implies that \"the current value in consumption\" is a kind of single, fi xed price tag. But this is not at all the correct picture. Option value is really defi ned by reference to expected consumer surplus. Expected surplus is not a single price tag attached to an entity. Rather, it is a statistic computed from values that vary in various possible realized states of the world, taking into account the probability with which each state might be realized. Fourth, their defi nition, which characterizes the situation as one in which \"the future availability of the amenity (its supply) is uncertain\", obscures, if not falsifi es, the working assumption of most defi nitions of option value. According to them, the supply is entirely certain because determined by the dichotomous choice to conserve or not to conserve. Supply is (assumed) assured by conservation; it is (assumed) zero in the absence of conservation. 104 Fifth, the defi nition fails to properly attend to the kind of uncertainty that does give rise to option value, according to many economists. That is uncertainty in a consumer's demand for the good, which might or might not be conserved.

Some participants in the debate even question whether option value, under any reasonable interpretation, has standing as a legitimate, independent category of economic value. See, for example, Cory and Saliba ( 1987 ) , whose \"Requiem for Option Value\" sounds the dirge for the concept of option value, at least as a component of natural value.

Therefore, this section departs from other parts of the book by devoting some detailed attention to what is really involved in the underlying economic concepts of option value and quasi-option value. This should give some better idea about what sort of argument is required in order to establish that either kind of value attaches to biodiversity. And it should make plain how far short of meeting these requirements claims about the option value of biodiversity fall. 110 First, I explicate the concept of garden-variety option value, henceforth (for the most part) simply \"option value\". I then show why skepticism concerning its application to the conservation of biodiversity is justifi ed. I repeat this two-part exercise for quasi-option value. 111 In between, I briefl y comment on the epistemological vocabulary that enters into these economic discussions. 110 I am aware of no other similar discussion, accessible to non-professional economists, in the environmental and conservation literature. 111 I must forewarn the reader that my presentation barely scrapes the surface of the conceptual issues that concern option value and quasi-option value. The literature on these two concepts is enormous. Large, too, are the gaps between the accounts of professional economists of how, exactly to defi ne and use it. The economist Richard Bishop ( 1986 , 134), one of the most distinguished contributors to the option value debate, observes that the discussion of option value is \"often very technical and confusing\". This is a grand understatement. Compounding the problem is the fact that economists sometimes are not the most lucid writers and that they do not adopt a uniform vocabulary or formulation for even the most basic concepts.

So it must be for option value, a term that the estimable economist Burton Weisbrod ( 1964 ) introduced in a seminal paper. He proceeded by way of a story that is rather odd (to my way of thinking), but which nonetheless captured the imagination of many economists. The story concerns a park run as a business by a private concern. 112 Despite being run with all possible effi ciencies, the business is a losing proposition based on the people who actually show up to visit. Moreover, there is every indication that it will remain a loser. Despite this economically gloomy picture, Weisbrod grasps for an economic straw that would yet justify preserving the park. He (Weisbrod 1964 , 472) fi nds it in \u2026 the existence of people who anticipate purchasing the commodity (visiting the park) at some time in the future, but who, in fact, never will purchase (visit) it. \u2026they will be willing to pay something for the option to consume the commodity in the future. This \"option value\" should infl uence the decision of whether or not to close the park and turn it to an alternative use.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Option Value and Conservation"}, {"text": "In other words, Weisbrod suggests that in the park's \"option value\", we might fi nd a legitimate basis for boosting its total economic value. This hitherto hidden component of economic value is ensconced in the preferences of persons who anticipate visiting the park, though (as Weisbrod allows) they might (or indeed, actually) never do so. These preferences occur in the context of an ability to ensure the certainty of this environmental good's supply in the face of what economists call \"uncertainty in demand\". 113 , 114 Some context for option value as a category of economic value is provided by relating it to existence value, mentioned at the end of Sect. 2.1.2.1 . Although existence value, unlike option value, does not depend on uncertainty, in another basic way, these two categories of economic value are nevertheless kissing cousins. Therefore , the restricted goal of my discussion is to suggest how fragile the concepts are by pulling on a well selected few of the main discussion threads connected to them. For those wishing to plow deeper into this fertile ground, I recommend beginning with Weisbrod ( 1964 ) for the seminal idea, Arrow and Fisher ( 1974 ) for the original and lucid explication of quasi-option value, and any of the several papers on the subject by W. Michael Hanemann (see references, including Fisher and Hanemann ( 1986 ) ), who is unusually clear in his thinking and writing on this subject. 112 Fortunately, this description does not really apply to Sequoia National Park, despite the fact that Weisbrod ( 1964 , 471) fi nds this conceit \"useful for the\u2026 exposition\". 113 The literature on option value is extraordinarily convoluted on the relationship of uncertainty in demand and uncertainty in supply. I attempt a high-wire balancing act that synthesizes considerations relating to uncertainties in both domains. 114 This interpretation -in terms of garden-variety option value -is just one of two main schools of interpreting Weisbrod's suggestive but vague story. As already noted, Arrow and Fisher ( 1974 ) , Hanemann ( 1984 ) , and Fisher and Hanemann ( 1986 ) see quasi-option value as an alternative interpretation. 6.9 Biodiversity Options This is so especially on Weisbrod's formulation, according to which those who anticipate visiting might (or as he says, in fact) never actually do so. Option value and existence value are both types of \"passive use\" or \"nonuse\" value, in the parlance of modern economics. 115 In other words, they are both passive ways of \"consuming\" a resource. In Weisbrod's story, visiting the park is the predominantly non-rivalrous and non-exclusive way of \"consuming\" 116 the park. This contrasts with its rivalrous and exclusive consumption as a source of timber or granite. When I \"consume\" an environmental good for its existence or option value, I do not diminish its value to you (consumption in this way is non-rivalrous). Furthermore, there is not a way to exclude you from enjoying the good for its existence or option value. Nor can you be kept from doing this more or less simultaneously with me (the resource is non-excludable). For Weisbrod, it appears that the major respect in which option value differs from existence value is that the former has some pretense of being about a desire (however uncertain) for eventual consumption (even when, a la Weisbrod, that desire is never actually consummated), while the latter does not. From this perspective, a non-economist might conceive of existence value as the limiting case of option value when the latter's un certainty about demand for a resource fades into the certainty of a kind of consumption that is confi ned to human imagination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 516, "end": 525, "text": "113 , 114", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1437, "text": "112", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1614, "text": "113", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2468, "text": "115", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Option Value and Conservation"}, {"text": "I now continue with a somewhat technical explication of Weisbrod's intuition in the context of a conservation problem, which focuses on a place that can undergo more or less of the kind of development that can affect biodiversity. 117 The ecological euphemism for this is \"habitat conversion\".

It is good to keep in mind that this is a simplifi cation, which ignores the less frequently considered source of uncertainty about her demand for q: u() itself might not be fi xed (last in the list of demand-affecting factors above). Now suppose that each state s occurs with probability p s such that S p s = 1. Note that this apparently mundane condition implies a startlingly strong epistemic claim: The set of all relevant alternative states is known and so is the probability of occurrence for each state in this complete set. Continue to assume that the supply of biodiversity is certainly Q with the conservation project P and it is certainly 0 without it (~P). Then the expected utility EU P for Ms. Consumer with P is the sum of the utilities for each state s, weighted by that state's probability of occurrence: So much for the preliminaries. To see how uncertainty fi gures in creating option value, let's start by assuming that there is none -and particularly, that there is no uncertainty in demand. This is equivalent to saying both that Ms. Consumer's utility function u() is fi xed and that u() is constant-valued in s. That is, Ms. Consumer's demand for any level q of biodiversity, like its supply (though contingent on the choice of P or ~ P), is fi xed and certain: because (per the tentative assumption of demand certainty) the utility for any state s is the same as that for any other state. What would our certain demander pay up front -that is, ex ante -for the conservation project? Assuming that she is an individual of the species Homo economicus -that is, she is a preference maximizer who evaluates any set of alternatives by doing a cost-benefi t analysis according to the rules of neoclassical economics -she knows the price. That price is the \"option price\" OP, which satisfi es: OP is the answer to a single question that spans the entire set of possible states s. Beware: we still have not gotten to \"option value \". 121 Whether OP is positive, negative, or zero depends on the shape of Ms. Consumer's utility function u(). 122 That is, it depends on whether u() is higher or lower when the amount of biodiversity is some nonzero quantity Q versus 0. Ms. Consumer might prefer a more biodiverse world. In that case, U P > U ~P , which means that she would pay for the conservation project (OP > 0). But nothing a priori justifi es assuming that her preference is for a more biodiverse world. Nor does any contingent matter of fact about the world have this universal implication. And in fact, she might strongly prefer the benefi ts of development and regard a nonzero level of biodiversity as an obstacle to that more desirable state of affairs. In that case, U P < U ~P , and she would demand payment to allow the nonzero amount Q of biodiversity (OP < 0). Of course, if U P = U ~P , then she will not be inclined to lobby either for or against conservation. 123 The option price OP is one way to price the conservation project P. There is an alternative approach to pricing the project, which hinges on the answer to a different 121 Unfortunately, in one of a number of terminological confusions that plague this topic, what Weisbrod calls \"option value\" in his paper is now called \"option price \" by most, if not all economists, who follow the usage of Krutilla et al. ( 1972 ) . I follow this now-more-common usage. 122 As Plummer and Hartman ( 1986 ) help to explain further along in the main text, this concept of option price differs in signifi cant respects from the concept more familiar from options in stock and other real markets. See Note 130. 123 I cannot account for the statement in van Kooten and Bulte ( 2000 , 296) that \"OP\u2026 is always positive\", unless these authors are fi xated on the narrow sense of option that applies to stocks. Otherwise, their claim would seem to require a priori justifi cation of a proposition that is a contingency and that can tip either way. Empirically, one fi nds that development (no conservation) sometimes is preferred. In such a case, a consumer would demand payment for allowing the conservation project. That is, the option price would be negative. None of this depends on how risk-averse or risk-welcoming the consumer might be. I detail this because, as previously mentioned, van Kooten and Bulte ( 2000 ) appear to be a primary economic reference for Maclaurin and Sterelny ( 2008 ) . I have not encountered another explicit statement of this erroneous assumption. But it is possible that this assumption is nevertheless implicitly made by those who argue for the (positive) option value of the natural world. If it is (erroneously) supposed that there is no downside (negative option value), then the case basing conservation decisions on option value will (illegitimately) appear much more palatable. question: The alternative imagines Ms. Consumer dwelling separately in each of the possible states s of the world. For each state, it asks her as part of that state, what amount would she be willing to pay (or demand in payment) for enjoying (or suffering with) a quantity q = Q (versus q = 0) of biodiversity in it. The number of questions is equal to the cardinality of the complete set of possible states s.

There are many well-known instances where the phylogenetic isolation and phenotypical distinctiveness of a creature are the result of the dying off of nearby sister branches in the tree of life. The demise of most of an extant organism's near relatives can be strong evidence that it shares with its extinct cousins a lack of robust evolutionary potential or that it lacks an ability to adapt to changing conditions (adaptive plasticity). The phylogenetic isolation of a creature such as the tuatara is an indication that it and its now-extinct relatives are relatively incapable of striking out on a new adaptive course. Stephen Jay Gould ( 1996 , 72) makes this point by reference to Equus caballus , the modern horse -\"a remnant of a remnant\", as he characterizes this species. It is, as he says, a remnant of steady perissodactyl (not just horse) decline in contrast to equally steady ascent of artiodactyls as the dominant representatives of modern macrofauna. E. caballus is an isolated twig at the tip of the tree of life where once was some quite bushy foliage. This certainly leaves a lot of horsey morphospace vacant.

Still according to the latter-day perfectionist view, biodiversity is valuable to the extent that it exemplifi es this state of perfection or one derived from it without anthropogenic infl ection. Human activities can do nothing to improve on the perfect state, which, after all, was already perfect (in the relevant, natural sense); their effects can only be adulterating, except insofar as they defl ect the state of nature back towards the imaginary state defi ned by a history uninfl ected by humans after the prescribed juncture of perfection. To the extent that humans cause biodiversity to deviate from the natural biological order, they compromise the natural good of the world. This sentiment is the spine of the position that holds up exotic creatures as aliens, less desirable than natives. 142 Of course, the notion of a natural order carries with it the burden of understanding what makes a particular order \"natural\", why a natural order is a good (or at least better than an \"unnatural\" order), and how it should guide human choices and actions. There is not a little irony in tying biodiversity to this burden, for the notion of \"wilderness\" also largely hinges on some similar notion of natural perfection, which famously, humans can only \"trammel\", if they are not careful. 143 Hitched to the same post, the debate about the value of biodiversity plunges into the depths of the same tangled debates that once consumed the value of wilderness -debates that precipitated that latter concept's widespread supplanting by biodiversity as emblematic of natural value.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1352, "end": 1355, "text": "142", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1845, "text": "143", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biodiversity as the Natural Order"}, {"text": "By common consensus, wilderness, conceived as a place \"untrammeled by man\", appears to have vanished almost completely from the planet.

As remarked in Sect. 5.1.4 , there is essentially no ecosystem on the planet -considered as including its diverse community of organisms -that is un affected by a wide range of human activities. If the \"natural order\" is one in which (according to one prevalent suggestion) humans have not heavily interfered with the \"natural progression\"of the world, then this order is largely or perhaps entirely absent in the current state of the world. This makes it diffi cult to fi nd grounds for thinking that the current order, which is evidently already a deviation from the natural order, should be defended, conserved, or even restored to some very recent state -a state that will inevitably still be marred by human-induced deviations from the natural order, which (on most perfectionist accounts) already have a history centuries or millennia long. 144 Current-day thinkers tend to substitute the term \"naturalness\" for \"natural order\", but to all appearances, their philosophy sprouts from the same roots as that of Aquinas and Leibniz. The verbs \"affect\" and \"interfere\" (italicized in the preceding paragraphs) fi gure prominently in characterizations of how human infl uence on the \"natural\" world have compromised its naturalness. By the lights of some thinkers, the extreme degree to which humans have affected and interfered with nature is thought to have suffi ciently destroyed the natural order so as to entail \"the end of nature\". 145 The environmental philosopher Dale Jamieson accepts the basic framework in which the \"end of nature\" claim is made. But he believes that the rumored \"end of nature\" is greatly, or at least somewhat, exaggerated. While setting aside the question of how much the quality of naturalness explains about nature's value, he (Jamieson 2008 , 164) regards naturalness to be \"a matter of degree\", and the degree of nature's naturalness to be an axiological barometer -that is, a salient property or characteristic that is a sound basis for judging the degree to which nature has value as nature (in contrast to its value as resource, for example). Finally, the degree of naturalness, according to Jamieson, is a function of how human infl uence is involved in the causal chain that led to a temporary terminus in the current state of the world.

First (initially putting aside the validity of the distinction), he neglects to state explicitly why he thinks the alleged distinction between affecting and producing makes a difference for nature's naturalness, or for determining whether or not \"the end of nature\" is at hand. As he grants (Jamieson 2008 , 163) , if the end of nature is not at hand, this must be so despite the fact that \"human infl uence is so pervasive that no part of nature remains untouched.\" Or, to put this in the terms of modern ecology, if we are not at the end of nature, this is so despite the fact that there might not remain a single biome on the planet that is not an anthropogenic biome (Ellis and Ramankutty 2008 ) . 147 Jamieson does not explicitly state the purpose of his distinction \"between X affecting Y, and Y being a product of X\". But it seems clear that he believes that it serves to separate two kinds of human infl uences, which differ in their effect on nature's naturalness. On the one hand, humans can affect nature and do so without thereby affecting its state of being natural. On the other hand, any change in nature that humans produce is, by virtue of that, an unnatural state, or at least a state of reduced naturalness. Establishing the relevance of this difference to the issue that motivates Jamieson's discussion -of whether or not nature is already at its end -requires one fi nal claim of an empirical nature.

As he says, Jamieson \"hopes\" that his readers will feel the intuitive force behind it. I suppose that he also hopes that his readers will feel the intuitive appeal of the distinction's force in bifurcating human infl uences on nature, along the lines I have just suggested. But he offers no supporting argument; I do not feel the intuitive force that Jamieson hopes I will feel; and no matter how hard I look, I do not see any light between X affecting Y (on the one hand) and Y being a product of X's infl uence (on the other). 148 One might think that the clues for fi nding the light will be found in the two contrasted cases (briefl y mentioned above, in the fi rst quotation from Jamieson) of person-person interaction, which Jamieson offers as models for the two contrasted cases of human-ecosystem interaction. But I think that there is more in the personperson model to derail the analysis of the human-ecosystem interaction than to keep it on track. The interhuman interaction concerns a decision, of possibly great personal signifi cance, that one person (in this case, a student) makes as (one initially supposes) an autonomous rational agent. Quite clearly, the manner in which Jamieson exerts infl uence on that agent is an important moral consideration. Offering guidance that is not based on his own personal interest in the choice is permissible; threats are not. But none of this carries over to infl uencing the environment because, quite simply, it is not an autonomous agent that makes decisions that matter to it. 149 The person-person model also goes off track considered apart from its role as a model for human-environment interactions. I believe that whatever difference there is between the two interactions hinges on tacitly transforming the student from a fully autonomous agent in the fi rst case, in which Jamieson's role is merely \" providing\u2026 information that [she] may or may not take into account\", into someone or something whose freedom to decide is severely truncated in the second case, where the decision is no longer hers, but rather \"a product of [Jamieson's] infl uence\". Perhaps the student is really now a robot, which Jamieson has programmed with a certain decision procedure that yields the decision that he \"recommends\". Or less dramatically, perhaps the student is still a person but Jamieson has given her a drug that temporarily disables or seriously impairs her ability to deliberate in a way that properly balances all her own interests. Or perhaps Jamieson's infl uence on the student is more subtly coercive, by dint of his position of relative power over the student. If one resists this tacit transformation and presumes that the student remains as fully autonomous and rational in the second (\"product of\") case as in the fi rst (\"affected by\") one, then the opening between these two cases collapses. Insofar as it is natural to say that her decision about what to study is a product of Jamieson's infl uence, it is equally natural to say that is because he has affected her decision. 150 Nor does intention appear to provide an opening between \"affecting\" and \"being a product of\". In Jamieson's two human-environment interactions, both the shortening of the growing season and the presence of the zebra mussels in the Great Lakes are causally attributable, in part, to human actions and patterns of behavior. But no one intended to shorten the growing season; and no one intended to transport zebra mussels into the Great Lakes. Both are inadvertent and unplanned side effects of actions taken with intentions that had nothing to do with those effects. In both cases the lack of intention is clear because awareness of these specifi c effects and even of the possibility of their occurring -arguably a necessary, but not a suffi cient condition for their being intended -emerged only after the fact.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 666, "end": 669, "text": "148", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1675, "text": "149", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3180, "end": 3183, "text": "150", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biodiversity as the Natural Order"}, {"text": "Perhaps \"product\" is supposed to connote \"a salient result of actions or behavior\".

Suppose that the case of producing a Great Lakes full of zebra mussels were replaced by that of constructing a condominium in a wetland area. Condos, unlike the relocation of zebra mussels, are produced in the primary sense of \"made or fabricated\". Their fabrication is the product of human planning and design, and therefore (unlike the transplanting of zebra mussels) intentional. Directly tied to the intentional production of the condos is the salient result consisting in the wetland's transformation.

So far as intention is concerned, no one would dispute that the condos required careful planning and design: The intent was to build condos. But one must take care to distinguish that intention from a full accounting of the salient consequences of acting with that intention. The peculiar (intentional) nature of intention is such that, when doing A ends up (also) realizing B, a person who intended to do A need not also have intended to do B. That is certainly true when she had no idea that B would come to pass as a consequence of her doing A. But it is also true when she knew B to be an inevitable consequence of A; and it is true even when she intended to do A by doing B. In the fi rst case, she might acknowledge that she knew that B would follow from A. In the second case, she might acknowledge that she did B precisely in order to do A. In both cases, she might be held responsible for B. But in all these cases, she might also truthfully maintain that it was only A that she intended.

That is partly because \"degree of causal involvement\" is, at best, a tricky philosophical knot to unravel. This is evident from Jamieson's own cases: It is highly doubtful that there exists any straightforward or incontrovertible basis for comparing the degree of human causal involvement in the shortened growing season versus the degree of causal involvement in a hitchhiking organism establishing itself in a new locale. At the highest level of causal description, both were caused (in part) by characteristic human behavior connected with economic pursuits.

In the context of a perfectionist state model, there is something of the theory of original sin in this precept, which views as inherently damaging the living of a characteristically human life. 153 The third characteristic is that an implicit reference to historical memory is curled up inside the state model. That is, the state of perfection -or of the relative im perfection that is a deviation from it -is underdetermined by the state of affairs observed at any instant in time. One cannot solve for the degree of perfection without bringing into the equation the causal history of what one observes. 154 For example, and saliently, there is no general principle whereby one can distinguish between an exotic and a native organism by merely observing the current state of an ecosystem. The exotic, considered as an organism that doesn't belong, cannot be fi ngered without reference to observed past states (including, most obviously, a previous record of the exotic organism's absence), or by reference to observed events -most saliently human actions and activities that introduced the creature by something other than \"natural\" means. 155 153 Of course, the theory goes on to urge that, although people necessarily sin, they ought to arrange to sin a little less.

Those who connect the natural order to autonomy are none too clear about what this connection consists in. One might start, simply enough, with the thought that in the natural order of things, nature is autonomous. If \"autonomy\" with regard to nature means merely \"unaffected by humans\" or \"not a human product\", then the proposition that perfectly ordered nature is autonomous is underwhelmingly true, for it follows in a straightforward way from the perfectionist defi nition of the natural order.

As applied to the natural world, this notion of morally respect-worthy autonomy would entail that nature have similar entitlement to pursue its existence on its own terms. But since nature has no conception of a good for itself, let alone an interest in pursuing such a conception, it seems certain that nature is not autonomous in this sense, no matter how infl uenced (or not) by people.

This, I believe, is the origin of now common talk about \"ecosystem health\". 159 Medical triage protocols are generally regarded, not as a more or less uniform \"prescription for action\" under any pressing circumstance, but rather as a class of protocols that vary according to context. Hospital emergency rooms, pandemics, and battlefi elds are signifi cantly different contexts that call for different protocols.

Under these circumstances, one might think that it is singularly important not to devalue a place or its resident \"chunk\" of biodiversity whose imminent total demise will be ensured by continuing insults. 160 Sarkar's discussion is troubling in a third way, which has to do with his proposed criteria for segregating triage \"patients\" into disjoint classes. 161 His preferred patientclassifying tool is what conservation biologists call \"Population Viability Analysis\" (PVA). By Sarkar's own admission, there is a radical lack of scientifi c consensus on how to use PVA in conservation, which is an unsurprising consequence of radical disagreement on what it even means. In their utter opacity, the various defi nitions of PVA are reminiscent of the defi nitions of scalar \"indexes\" of biodiversity itself.

As it turns out, his views on viability are in sharp discord with other tenets of his axiology. Logic dictates that if viability enhances or is essential to value of biodiversity, then endangerment militates against the value of biodiversity. Generally, the more something is endangered, the less viable it is; and conversely. Sarkar defi es this logic. According to him, (for example, Sarkar 2002 , 147) despite diminishing biodiversity's value, its endangerment adds to the mandate to conserve it.

To establish harm generally requires that a subject that suffers the harm be identifi ed. A harm is a harm to someone or something, or to some group of persons or things. When it comes to biodiversity, there are two classes of theory on this. The fi rst presumes that the harmed parties are current or future humans or both. The harm consists in depriving us currently respiring humans and our yet-to-be respiring descendents of such things as ecosystem services, mankind's pharmacopoeia, some preeminently valuable knowledge, or some of the many other goods that are supposed to fl ow from the world's biodiversity. But on the evidence examined in this chapter, none of these things have the kind of value that is claimed for them. 175 A different take on who or what is harmed arises from the common use of the phrase \"harming biodiversity\" in a context -such as \"the war on Nature\" -that suggests that its literal meaning is intended: As a consequence of \"losses in biodiversity\", biodiversity itself is harmed. After all, if you cut off my arm, I will suffer a harm as a result of its loss and you will have harmed me. This grants literary license to say, more generally, that a loss of some part of X is a harm to X. That includes, for example, X = a car, which \"suffers\" the loss of a hubcap; or X = the set of all cars on the road, which suffers the loss of mine, which just broke down. But in these cases, the \"suffering\" is a matter of moral indifference and the harm to the car when I remove its hubcaps does not warrant moral condemnation of my action. Much the same can be said of biodiversity, when it \"suffers\" a loss or when it is \"harmed\". Biodiversity -that entity, which is commonly measured by the number of species -is simply not capable of suffering in any morally interesting sense.

But they are not the only hurdles, as consideration of the other, abovementioned moral provisos reveals. Let's focus attention on the matter of intention, starting with the position at one extreme -that humankind is guilty of the kind of vicious behavior that would be involved in \"waging a war on Nature\". 176 Consider: If something is done that in fact constitutes a harm, and if it is done \"viciously\" -in the sense of \"intending cruel or violent harm\" -then these factors signifi cantly color how one views the moral burden of causally responsible parties. In the broad moral scheme of things, the nature of the intent varies. Other factors, all varying partly, but not completely independently of intent, intertwine with intent to produce a fi nal moral assessment of culpability. One of those factors is how directly the harm is a consequence of actions and behavior. The more tenuous and convoluted the causal chain and the more that causal factors beyond human control dominate, the weaker the case for moral responsibility is generally supposed to be. Another variable, related to the last, registers the capability of agents to perceive the causal connection to the harmful consequences and to recognize that these consequences do indeed constitute a harm. Furthermore, benefi ts that accrue to the harming agent are commonly thought to substantially increase how reprehensible is the harm infl icted.

Unintended harm. The causal agents act and behave to attain some benefi t, but they are not (fully) aware that their action or behavior is harmful. If some harm is done, the agents might not perceive it as a harm. Or some consequence might register as harmful in some small or insignifi cant degree, but absent an appreciation of its full and possibly great signifi cance to the party harmed. In short, though harm is done, no (or little) harm is intended. In criminal law, some cases of reckless endangerment fall into this category. However, these cases typically require that the harm be foreseeable. My defi nition is broader and includes cases in which even the ability to foresee cannot reasonably be expected. 2. Collateral damage. The causal agents are (fully) aware that among the consequences of their actions are very likely unwanted harmful ones. These unwanted harms are viewed as unavoidable in attaining a benefi t, but they are not directly instrumental in attaining that benefi t. This corresponds to what, in recent, military-derived parlance, is called \"collateral damage\". It is less clear that a harm of this kind is completely un intended, for the action aimed at the benefi t is intended and the attendant harm is expected. Perhaps one could express this unclarity by saying that the harm is only \"indirectly\" intended. Most commonly, a case of collateral damage is not a case of willful rapacity. That is because the harm is not a means to the end of a benefi t; nor does the harm itself constitute any part of a benefi t. However, these exclusions do not entirely preclude rapacious behavior in which the harm, though unwanted, is seen as justifi ed by the benefi t. Picture the bank robber who \"must\" shoot the teller poised to trip the alarm. Even the act of scamming an elderly couple out of their pension can be viewed in similar fashion: The scammer derives no great benefi t from the emotional and fi nancial distress that she sadly \"must\" infl ict on her gullible victims. The benefi t of the scam is the money transferred from scammed to scammer. Of course, the scammer also can be said to treat the elderly couple as a (mere) means to her end. In that respect, the scam example might be said to belong to the following category. 3. Means to benefi ts. The causal agents understand their acts to be harmful, but additionally regard their acts of harming to be a means or part of a means for attaining certain benefi ts, though the infl iction of harm in itself does not constitute a benefi t. Thus, it is by means of using a hostage as a human shield that the desperate criminal protects herself and makes good her escape. But placing the hostage in harm's way has no benefi t independent of that. The desperada would gladly don her invisible cloak, had she remembered to bring it along for the heist. This is a step beyond \"indirect\" intention. The use of a harmful means to a benefi cial end makes it plausible to say that, in contrast to collateral damage, the harm is intended in a direct way, qualifi ed only by the fact that the focus and motivating intent is to attain the benefi cial ends. It is also plausible to say that the good of such ill-gotten benefi ts are tainted in some serious way by the nature of the means employed to attain them. 4. Constitutes a benefi t. The act of harming is not just a means to a benefi t, but constitutes the benefi t or part thereof, and the causal agents are (fully) cognizant of this; that is, they understand that the harm to others amounts to a benefi t for themselves.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Causal Factors and History 169"}, {"text": "This constitutive relationship gives us leave to say that the harm is as much the focus of intent as the benefi t that it constitutes.

Needless to say, every hectare of land that goes under the plow, under the foundation of a structure, or under the asphalt running up to it becomes quite a different place. So does a wide swath of surrounding land. And this change in environment is refl ected in which collections of organisms do well or not so well there. In one of the more comprehensive and credible surveys that shed light on this, Wallace Erickson and his colleagues ( 2005 ) estimate that buildings and other infrastructure are responsible for the vast majority of the 500 million to 1 billion bird deaths annually in the United States alone. Human transportation continues in the grand tradition of the Columbian exchange, reshuffl ing the biotic deck by providing transportation for non-ticketpaying, nonhuman stowaways to places that they would not likely have visited otherwise or quite so soon. Roads and road traffi c kill all manner of creatures that attempt crossings. They also are ecological walls, despite an unimpressive presence in the vertical dimension. They substantially alter the mix of organisms and hence the biodiverse state of affairs in their vicinity, not just by subdividing previously undivided habitat, but also by creating habitat edges, whose asphalt boundary creates distinctive ecological conditions quite unlike either the previously contiguous expanse or the interior of the new subdivisions. 177 Merely turning on the lights turns off the lights for some number of creatures.

However, two parallel shifts in human thinking have recently had more than a little signifi cance for how biodiversity is regarded. First is the nascent understanding, vested mostly in a relatively small number of scientists and environmentalists, of how the effects of human behavior and activities on individual species enter into the larger biodiversity picture. The second is the rise of some strongly held, strongly promoted, but I would say, weakly justifi ed convictions on just what that picture should look like.

A new host species, even if not a particularly competent disease reservoir, helps sustain vector populations that still feed copiously from competent reservoirs. This is the role of O. virginia (while-tailed deer) in some Lyme systems such as the well-studied one in the northeast U.S. It is also the role of Cervus elaphus (red deer), the primary host of louping ill, whose transmission vector is I. ricinus , another tick.

Too high, and the deer draw too many bites from viremic hosts, such as Lagopus lagopus scotica (red grouse) (Keesing et al. 2006, 494). 5. In a disease system in which interspecifi c transmission rates exceed intraspecifi c transmission rates, a new host species increases the prevalence of infections in all nonhuman hosts through interspecifi c transmission.

Similarly, two mosquito vectors of West Nile viral encephalitis -Culex tarsalis , which feeds on birds and maintains high rates of avian infection, and C. pipiens , which bites both birds and people -are jointly responsible for high human infection rates (Molyneux et al. 2008 , 307).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "1 A hypothetical set of states refl ecting uncertain demand for biodiversity based solely on the uncertain \"quality\" of a given level of biodiversity", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td> State (s) </td><td> s1 </td><td> s2 </td><td> s3 </td><td> s4 </td></tr><tr><td> Probability ( \u2022 s\n ) </td><td> 0.19999 </td><td> 0.40001 </td><td> 0.39999 </td><td> 0.00001 </td></tr><tr><td> Surplus (CSs\n ) </td><td> \u2212700 </td><td> \u221210 </td><td> 360 </td><td> 10,000 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "2 A hypothetical set of states refl ecting uncertain demand for biodiversity as inTable 6.1 , but also taking into account the cost of a complement good", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
