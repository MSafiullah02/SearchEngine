            "text": "The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) has been used as a model to study influenza virus infection and immune responses since the 1970s (Wetherbee 1973; Phair et al. 1979; Azoulay-Dupuis et al. 1984). The utility of this species for the study of influenza virus transmission was, however, first described in 2006 (Lowen et al. 2006). The development of the guinea pig transmission model offered an important alternative to the better-established ferret and mouse models. Unlike mice, guinea pigs support efficient transmission of influenza viruses adapted to human hosts and are highly susceptible to infection with a broad range of influenza A and B viruses\u2014without prior adaptation of the viruses through serial passage. Compared to ferrets, guinea pigs are relatively small and inexpensive, and seronegative guinea pigs are easily obtained, facilitating the performance of experiments that are adequately powered to gain statistically significant results. The utility of the guinea pig transmission model is evidenced by the expansion of its use since 2006. Research performed in the model has contributed important insights into influenza virus transmission, including the effects of viral, host, and environmental factors. This chapter describes influenza virus infection, growth, and transmission in guinea pigs; highlights how these properties differ among influenza viruses adapted to human, swine, and avian hosts; and provides an overview of knowledge gained through the study of influenza virus transmission in the guinea pig model.",

            "text": "Guinea pigs are highly susceptible to infection by the intranasal route with influenza viruses derived from human, avian, and swine hosts. Determinations of 50 % infectious dose (ID50) for a handful of human and avian isolates have yielded values ranging from 3 PFU to 66 PFU (Lowen et al. 2006; Bouvier et al. 2008; Steel et al. 2009; Gabbard et al. 2013). While precise ID50 values have not been reported for swine isolates, the success of low dose inoculations with isolates of both North American and Eurasian swine influenza virus lineages indicates that the ID50 is approximately 100 PFU or less in each case (J. Steel, unpublished data). These results for ID50 in guinea pigs are similar to what has been reported for humans and ferrets (Alford et al. 1966), indicating that guinea pigs and ferrets have comparable natural susceptibilities to infection with a broad range of influenza viruses (Gustin et al. 2011; Lakdawala et al. 2011). Indeed, a sero-survey of domestic guinea pigs in Ecuador, obtained either from farms or live animal markets, revealed antibodies to influenza A and B viruses in the majority of samples tested (Leyva-Grado et al. 2012). These results suggest that guinea pigs in close contact with humans naturally acquire influenza virus infection. Nevertheless, among the guinea pigs we have obtained from laboratory animal vendors since 2006, none has been found to be seropositive in hemagglutination inhibition assays (JS, AL and NB, unpublished data); we consider this to be an important advantage of the guinea pig over the ferret model.",

While nasal lavage fluid and homogenates of nasal turbinate yield high virus titers, infectious virus is typically present at lower levels or not detected in the lung (Lowen et al. 2006; Gabbard et al. 2013; Seibert et al. 2013). These findings are supported by histological staining for influenza virus antigen: on days 2 and 4 post-infection, viral protein is easily detected in the nasal tissues of guinea pigs infected with the human seasonal A/Panama/2007/1999 (H3N2) [Pan/99] virus, but not found in the lungs of the same animals (Gabbard et al. 2013). In humans, seasonal influenza virus infection is mainly confined to the upper respiratory tract, while growth in the lung is more rare and associated with severe disease (Treanor 2010). Also in ferrets, seasonal influenza viruses target mainly the upper respiratory tract (van der Laan et al. 2008; Zeng et al. 2013). Thus, in broad terms, the tropism of seasonal human influenza viruses in the guinea pig is similar to that typically observed in human hosts, as well as that of ferrets.",

            "text": "Interesting exceptions are seen with influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus, an early isolate from the 2013 outbreak in China, and with the highly pathogenic A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001 (H5N1) [DK/35] virus. When inoculated at high dose intranasally (106 PFU or EID50), these viruses initiated productive infection in the lung of guinea pigs (Gao et al. 2009; Gabbard et al. 2013). Under the same conditions, Pan/99 and A/rhea/North Carolina/39482/1993 (H7N1) viruses did not become established in the lung, despite successful delivery of the intranasal inoculum to this tissue (Gabbard et al. 2013). Interestingly, disruption of \u03b12,3 receptor binding in the DK/35 virus background also abrogated the growth of this virus in the guinea pig lung, suggesting that receptor usage is a major determinant of tropism for the guinea pig lower respiratory tract (Gao et al. 2009). Similarly, while human adapted strains remain localized in the upper respiratory tract of macaques, infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 and 2013 H7N9 viruses spread to the lung in these animals (Shinya et al. 2012; Watanabe et al. 2013). In humans, highly pathogenic H5N1 and A/Anhui/1/2013-like H7N9 viruses have caused lower respiratory tract complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a high proportion of the identified cases (Hien et al. 2004; Gao et al. 2013). Thus, tropism of the avian-like H5N1 and H7N9 viruses is broadened not only in guinea pigs, but also in humans and nonhuman primates.",

Compared to tissue collection typically used in mice, this method has the advantages of allowing serial sampling from the same animal and reducing animal numbers. Depending on the viral strain and inoculum dose, viral growth in the guinea pig upper respiratory tract peaks between days 2 and 4 after infection, and the infection is usually cleared by day 8 (Fig. 1). At the peak of shedding, titers obtained in guinea pig nasal washings are in the range of 106\u2013107 PFU/ml for human seasonal viruses (Lowen et al. 2006; Mubareka et al. 2009; Steel et al. 2011; Pica et al. 2012) and approximately 105\u2013107 PFU/ml for swine\ninfluenza viruses (Steel et al. 2010, 2011; Sun et al. 2010). Avian strains tested to date grew to maximum titers of approximately 104\u2013105 PFU/ml, with the notable exception of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus, which yielded 106\u2013107 TCID50/ml on day 2 post-infection (Steel et al. 2009; Gabbard et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013b). These trends in kinetics and peak titers are broadly comparable to those seen in ferrets (Maines et al. 2005, 2006; Belser et al. 2011; Barman et al. 2012) and the growth of human seasonal strains in guinea pigs is similar to that seen in experimentally infected humans (Carrat et al. 2008).\n",

The distribution of \u03b12,6 and \u03b12,3 sialylated glycans within host tissues is thought to be a major determinant of host susceptibility and viral tropism, and is therefore an important feature of animal models for influenza. Receptor distribution in the guinea pig respiratory tract has been examined by two methods: (i) staining of fixed tissue sections with lectins specific for \u03b12,6 or \u03b12,3 sialylated glycans (Gao et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2010) and (ii) binding to and detection of whole influenza virus on fixed tissue sections (termed \u2018virus histochemistry\u2019) (Gabbard et al. 2013; Siegers et al.

A 2009 pandemic isolate, A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1), showed high levels of binding to nasal concha as well as low and moderate positivity in the bronchioles and alveoli, respectively. The low pathogenic avian strains examined, including two 2013 H7N9 isolates, bound throughout the respiratory tract of the guinea pig. In contrast, two highly pathogenic avian-like viruses, A/VN/1194/04 (H5N1) and A/NL/219/03 (H7N7), did not show attachment in the upper respiratory tract but bound efficiently to tracheal and lung epithelia. Thus, overall, influenza virus receptors in the guinea pig appear to support attachment of human-adapted viruses mainly to the upper respiratory tract, and avian-adapted viruses either throughout the respiratory tract or to mainly lower respiratory tract tissues (Gabbard et al. 2013; Siegers et al. In Press). There is appreciable overlap between these attachment patterns and those seen in human samples. When human tissues are used as the substrate, avian influenza viruses tend to bind mainly to the lower respiratory tract, while human influenza viruses bind to both upper and lower tracts (van Riel et al. 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013; Siegers et al.

Nevertheless, examination of respiratory tissues from infected guinea pigs has revealed significant histopathological changes. Inspection of the upper airways of infected animals, the main site of viral replication, revealed rhinitis characterized by heavy nasal mucus secretion, mild to severe intraepithelial and lamina proprial inflammation, and mild to severe vacuolation of epithelia (Tang and Chong 2009; Gabbard et al. 2013). When high doses (~106 PFU or TCID50) of virus were used, marked histopathology in the lower respiratory tract of infected guinea pigs is also observed. Mild to severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia characterized by the infiltration of immune cells and stripping of ciliated epithelia have been reported with a number of different influenza strains (Azoulay-Dupuis et al. 1984; Kwon et al. 2009; Tang and Chong 2009; Van Hoeven et al. 2009a). As expected based on results from other animal models, the severity of lung pathology was greater for the 1918 pandemic strain and a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype virus than either a low pathogenic avian isolate or a seasonal human influenza virus (Van Hoeven et al. 2009a).",

Influenza B viruses show high levels of transmission in a contact model and intermediate transmissibility in a respiratory droplet model (Pica et al. 2012).

Namely, we used the model to test the effects of two environmental conditions that vary with the seasons, relative humidity, and temperature, on influenza virus\ntransmission. Infected and exposed guinea pigs were housed in environmental test chambers for the duration of the exposure period. Transmission efficiency was determined at temperatures of 5, 20, and 30 \u00b0C and relative humidities of 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80 %. Using several diverse influenza viruses, including Pan/99, A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1), A/New York/08-1253/2008 (H1N1), B/Victoria/2/1987 and B/Florida/4/2006, transmission was found to be markedly more efficient at 5 \u00b0C than at 20 \u00b0C (Lowen et al. 2007; Steel et al. 2011; Bouvier et al. 2012; Pica et al. 2012). Continuing this trend, transmission by respiratory droplet was highly inefficient when temperatures were increased to 30 \u00b0C (Lowen et al. 2007; Steel et al. 2011). Both high (80 %) and intermediate (50 %) humidities were found to reduce transmission efficiency in a respiratory droplet model (Lowen et al. 2007; Steel et al. 2011), in line with earlier data on the stability of influenza viruses in an aerosol (Schaffer et al. 1976). Although some effect of humidity and temperature have been observed when using a contact transmission model, the effects are dampened compared to those on respiratory droplet transmission, most likely due to the higher overall efficiency of transmission among co-caged animals (Lowen et al. 2008; Pica et al. 2012). Overall, examinations of influenza virus transmission under varying conditions of humidity and temperature strongly suggest that the seasonality of influenza is caused by improved transmission under cold, dry conditions found in the winter-time in temperature regions of the world.",

In particular, the amino acid changes E627K, D701N and G590S/Q591R, have each been implicated in the adaptation to humans of influenza viruses derived from avian and swine reservoirs (de Jong et al. 2006; Mehle and Doudna 2009; de Wit et al. 2010). The guinea pig model was used to test the roles of 627K and 701N in supporting transmission among mammals (Gao et al. 2009; Steel et al. 2009). K627E and K627E / D701N mutant viruses were generated in the backgrounds of the highly pathogenic A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus and the human seasonal Pan/99 (H3N2) virus (Steel et al. 2009). The H5N1 mutants were then compared to the wild-type virus in a contact transmission model, while the H3N2 strains were tested in a respiratory droplet model. In both viral backgrounds, the presence of either human-like adaptation (PB2 627K or 701N) led to greater transmission efficiency over the avian-like amino acid sequence. Similarly, in the context of the highly pathogenic A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001 (H5N1) virus, which is transmissible among co-housed guinea pigs, the presence of the wild-type asparagine at PB2 701 was required for transmission (Gao et al. 2009). This work identified PB2 627K and 701N as determinants of, not only growth and pathogenicity, but also transmission in mammals. Analogous results were also obtained in the ferret model, using the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain (Van Hoeven et al. 2009b). The observation that these residues contribute to the transmission of H3N2, H1N1, and H5N1 influenza viruses suggests that adaptations in the PB2 627 domain may be a prerequisite for mammalian transmission common to all influenza A subtypes.",

Although human infection with swine influenza viruses occurs occasionally when individuals are in close contact with pigs, these swine-adapted strains do not typically transmit onward from human-to-human. In contrast, the 2009 pandemic strain originated in the swine reservoir, crossed the species barrier to humans and spread rapidly through the human population, affecting an estimated 1\u20132 billion people world-wide (Van Kerkhove et al. 2013). These events raised the question, what viral traits differentiating the 2009 pandemic strain from other swine influenza viruses allowed its transmission among humans? One hypothesis related to the highly unusual genotype of this virus: six segments were derived from the North American triple reassortant swine lineage and two segments, NA and M, from the Eurasian swine lineage (Smith et al. 2009).",

The viruses were generated by reverse genetics using the isolates A/duck/Guangxi/35/2001 (H5N1) [DK/35] and A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1)[SC/09] and all gene combinations tested included the H5 HA. The wild-type DK/35 H5N1 virus transmitted efficiently among guinea pigs placed in the same cage, but not by a respiratory droplet route. Like other 2009 pandemic strains, SC/09 transmitted with high efficiency by respiratory droplet. The report by Zhang et al. is rich in data, but the most striking results were the highly efficient transmission of DK/35-based reassortant viruses carrying only the PA or NS gene segments of SC/09. It should be noted that the DK/35 virus H5 HA protein shows partial binding to 2,6 linked sialic acids and that this ability to bind human-type receptors was required for its transmission among co-caged guinea pigs (Gao et al. 2009). Thus, when combined with a semi-adapted HA protein in a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus background, the PA or NS gene segments of the 2009 pandemic virus are sufficient to support transmission among guinea pigs in the absence of direct or indirect contact (Zhang et al. 2013b).",

Two groups of guinea pigs were inoculated with Pan/99 virus (103 PFU per animal) and treated with 10 doses of oral oseltamivir in 1.5 % sucrose-water (75 mg/kg/day in two divided doses, administered 12 h apart) or a sucrose-water placebo, starting 4 h before inoculation and continuing for 5 days. The placebo-treated guinea pigs demonstrated normal nasopharyngeal virus shedding kinetics, and 3 of 4 animals transmitted Pan/99 by respiratory droplets to a naive partner animal (Fig. 2). However, among the Pan/99-inoculated, oseltamivir-treated guinea pigs, only one animal displayed a typical virus shedding pattern, while two guinea pigs had no detectable virus in any nasal washes, and five guinea pigs demonstrated protracted viral replication kinetics, with low virus titers (<103 PFU/ml) on day 2 post-inoculation and peak shedding delayed by 2\u20136 days. Importantly, none of the eight na\u00efve guinea pigs exposed to these Pan/99-inoculated, oseltamivir-treated guinea pigs became infected by respiratory droplet transmission (N.M. Bouvier and M. Michta, unpublished data). These experiments demonstrate that NA enzymatic function is required for maximally efficient influenza virus transmission among guinea pigs and suggest that treatment of influenza patients with NA inhibitors may prevent or reduce transmission among unvaccinated humans, though clinical trials would be required to confirm this hypothesis.\n",

Thus, it was hypothesized that this mutation may confer a slight fitness deficit sufficient to prevent widespread human-to-human transmission of viruses encoding it, but subtle enough to have been imperceptible in the ferret contact transmission experiments performed previously. Reverse genetics-derived Pan/99 viruses with and without the NA-E119V mutation were found to transmit with equal efficiency in the guinea pig contact transmission model, as had been seen with similar isolates in the ferret model (Herlocher et al. 2004; Yen et al. 2005). However, in the guinea pig respiratory droplet transmission model, wild-type Pan/99 again transmitted efficiently, to 7 of 8 exposed guinea pigs, while Pan/99 encoding the NA-E119V oseltamivir-resistance mutation transmitted to only 2 of 8 exposed guinea pigs (p < 0.05, by Fisher\u2019s exact test) (Bouvier et al. 2008). Thus, the results previously observed in the ferret contact transmission model were successfully replicated in the guinea pig model; however, the guinea pig respiratory droplet transmission experiments suggested that a subtle fitness penalty was indeed associated with acquisition of the E119V oseltamivir-resistance mutation.",

However, enhanced transmission efficiency among humans was one of only a few hypotheses that could account for the unprecedented, exponential increase in prevalence of the NA-H274Y mutation in sH1N1 viruses (Chao et al. 2012). With paired oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant Bris/59-like clinical isolates from the New York State Department of Health, we demonstrated that the oseltamivir-resistant isolate transmitted more efficiently among guinea pigs than its oseltamivir-sensitive counterpart. Using reverse genetics, we rescued reassortants between the oseltamivir-sensitive (A/New York/08-1253/2008, \u201cNY/1253\u201d) and -resistant (A/New York/08-1326/2008; \u201cNY/1326\u201d) isolates and found that expression of oseltamivir-resistant NY/1326 NA, in a virus backbone comprising the other seven segments from the oseltamivir-sensitive isolate NY/1253, was sufficient to significantly enhance transmission efficiency among guinea pigs (p = 0.009 by the logrank test). Because NY/1253 encodes two non-consensus residues (S336N and M430L) in its NA gene, we also reassorted it with the Bris/59 NA to create a virus that differs only by only two amino acids (NA-H274Y and D354G) from the 7:1 reassortant encoding the NY/1326 NA. This reassortant also transmitted less efficiently than the one encoding the 1326 NA, though it was narrowly nonsignificant (p = 0.078) (Fig. 3) (Bouvier et al. 2012). These data support the hypothesis that the exponential increase in oseltamivir-resistant Bris/59-like sH1N1 influenza viruses resulted from enhanced human-to-human transmissibility conferred primarily by the oseltamivir-resistant NA. These experiments also highlight an advantage of the guinea pig model; namely, lower cost relative to the ferret model, which enables the use of adequately powered experimental groups. A subtle but statistically significant enhancement in transmission efficiency could be demonstrated with experimental groups containing eight guinea pig pairs, whereas prior experiments using groups of four ferret pairs were insufficiently powered to reveal a significant difference in transmissibility between oseltamivir-sensitive and -resistant Bris/59-like viruses (Abed et al. 2011).\n",

These novel viruses have been shown to transmit efficiently by contact in both ferrets and guinea pigs (Belser et al. 2013; Gabbard et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2013) but generally less efficiently by respiratory droplets in both species (Belser et al. 2013; Gabbard et al. 2013; Hai et al. 2013; Richard et al. 2013; Watanabe et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013a; Zhu et al. 2013). In contrast to previous ferret transmission experiments demonstrating inefficient transmission of H3N2 viruses encoding the NA-R292K oseltamivir-resistance mutation (Herlocher et al. 2002; Yen et al. 2005), a reverse genetics-derived clone of the oseltamivir-resistant clinical isolate A/Shanghai/1/2013 (SH/1), encoding the NA-R292K mutation, transmitted no less efficiently than a 7:1 reassortant that expressed the oseltamivir-sensitive NA-R292 from A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH/1) in a SH/1 backbone. Because PR8 reassortants encoding the NAs from both SH/1 and AH/1 demonstrated roughly equivalent decrements in NA enzyme velocity and substrate affinity and in hemagglutination activity, it was hypothesized that reduced HA expression accompanying the oseltamivir-resistant NA may offset the decrements in NA enzymatic function conferred by the NA-R292K mutation (Hai et al. 2013). These experiments underscore the multigenic nature of fitness in influenza A viruses.",

Nevertheless, vaccines are not typically evaluated in terms of the efficiency of transmission to or from vaccinated individuals. To demonstrate the value of this approach, we tested immunization through natural infection, intramuscular administration of killed influenza virus, or intranasal infection with a live attenuated influenza virus (Lowen et al. 2009). Immunized guinea pigs were challenged either through intranasal inoculation or through exposure to acutely infected guinea pigs. In addition, na\u00efve animals were housed with vaccinated and challenged animals to assess the reduction in transmission efficiency achieved through vaccination. Immunity acquired through natural infection was found to fully protect from challenge with homologous and heterologous strains and, therefore, block any onward transmission. The live attenuated vaccine tested, encoding a truncated NS1 protein, also fully blocked transmission from vaccinated animals, but allowed partial transmission of the heterologous challenge virus to vaccinated guinea pigs. The killed, whole virus vaccine did not provide sterilizing protection, even against homologous challenge, by either intranasal or contact exposure routes. The killed vaccine, however, reduced but did not block onward transmission from vaccinated guinea pigs to na\u00efve cagemates (Lowen et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Expanding upon the work of Lowen and colleagues, (Lowen et al. 2009), Seibert and colleagues (Seibert et al. 2013) investigated the impact of immunoglobulin isotypes on transmission efficiency. With 30D1, a neutralizing mouse monoclonal IgG2b antibody directed at the globular head of the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus A/California/04/2009 (Cal/09), they observed that passive immunization by intramuscular administration of this antibody (at 10 mg/kg) did not protect na\u00efve guinea pigs from infection by transmission of Cal/09 from inoculated partner animals, despite achieving high serum antibody titers after immunization. In contrast, a single intranasal (IN) administration of 30D1 (900 ng per animal) in na\u00efve guinea pigs, which were subsequently exposed to Cal/09-inoculated partners, was sufficient to completely abrogate infection by transmission, suggesting that prevention of infection by respiratory droplets is mediated by the presence of neutralizing antibody at the respiratory mucosa, not in serum. To confirm this finding with a physiologically relevant isotype, the variable region of 30D1 was cloned into the murine IgA heavy chain gene, and expressed with murine \u03ba and J chains. Guinea pigs immunized intramuscularly with this 30D1 IgA construct at 1 mg/kg were not protected from infection with Cal/09 by transmission, but 7 of 8 guinea pigs immunized with 5 mg/kg of 30D1 IgA were protected. The 30D1 IgA antibody was detectible by ELISA in the nasal washes of guinea pigs immunized with 5 mg/kg of 30D1 IgA, but not in those given the lower dose. Collectively, these experiments indicate that mucosal immunity, particularly the expression of sufficient quantities of neutralizing antibodies at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract, is more important than serum IgG in preventing transmission of influenza viruses by respiratory droplets. These results, together with those of Lowen, Steel et al. (Lowen et al. 2009) and Houser et al. (Houser et al. 2013), suggest that inactivated influenza vaccines, which stimulate a primarily IgG antibody response, may not optimally protect against transmission of influenza viruses, and thus the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccines intended to block human-to-human transmission may be more accurately assessed with a correlate of protection other than serum IgG titers.",

            "text": "Research carried out in the guinea pig model over the past eight years has demonstrated the utility of this system for the study of influenza virus transmission. The robust growth and efficient transmission in guinea pigs of influenza viruses adapted to human hosts, compared to the poor growth and lack of transmission of most avian adapted strains, strongly supports the relevance of the model to transmission in the human population. While the absence of measurable signs of disease limits the use of the guinea pig for pathogenesis studies, analysis of tissues using histological methods allows the virulence of an infection to be gauged. Further characterization of the pathology induced by influenza viruses in the guinea pig is warranted. As more research groups adopt the guinea pig as a model system for influenza research, a need has arisen for more data on the differences and similarities between ferret and guinea pig models. A direct comparison, in which influenza virus growth, transmission, and disease are evaluated under standardized conditions in both species, would be highly valuable to the ultimate goal of understanding influenza in humans. Finally, despite significant recent progress, much remains to be learned about the factors driving influenza virus transmission. The reasons for the acute dependence of transmission on humidity and temperature are not yet clear. Similarly, mechanisms underlying the contributions of the M1 and/or M2 proteins and polymerase components to transmission phenotypes remain largely unknown. Ultimately, a comprehensive model of the viral traits required to support influenza virus transmission in avian versus mammalian species is needed. The complex relationships among viral components and between viral and host factors have made, and will continue to make, this aim difficult to attain. If achieved, however, an in-depth understanding of the requirements for sustained influenza virus transmission in both avian and mammalian reservoirs would be invaluable to public health efforts aimed at controlling influenza.",
