The main objective of this program is to identify antiviral agents with the potential to treat viral infections of public health importance, including those for newly emerging infections and those that are not a high priority for the pharmaceutical industry. NIAID ensures that the intellectual property rights of the compound supplier are protected. The viruses and models covered under this program include:",

The crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation and stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain has been elucidated (2) . The positions and structural transitions of key parts of the fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and two helical heptad repeat regions, clarified the mechanism of the F protein-mediated membrane fusion.
