The median age of our study population was 46.0 years, with severe patients being generally older with a median age of 50.5 years relative to that of 42.0 years among the mild cases (p = 0.049). Slightly more than half (53.8%) of the patients were male and there were no significant differences in the sex ratio between the severe and mild cases (p = 0.230). Twenty-one patients (23.1%) had one or more coexisting medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, kidney disease, and malignancies. Coexisting medical conditions were more prominent in the severe disease group (40% had chronic disease vs. 14.8% in mild disease group; p = 0.009). The median duration from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 4 days. All patients were confirmed as qPCR-positive eventually, while only 73.6% of patients were qPCR-positive when they first received the test. The qPCR-positive rate at different times was not different in the severe and mild disease groups (p = 0.884). In addition, the vital signs (pulse rate, temperature, and mean arterial pressure) between the two groups showed no significant differences. Compared to the severe disease group (6.7%), the mild disease group (19.7%) had a higher proportion of discharged cases. Of the two deceased patients who were critically ill, one had lung cancer and the other had hypertension. Both suffered respiratory and acute renal failure on the day of admission. The mortality rate was 2.2%. Taken together, our results supported that older patients with chronic disease were more likely to become critically ill and negative qPCR results could not confidently exclude infection with the virus at symptom onset.\n",

Together, 28 patients (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory system injury, with an especially higher rate (50% vs. 21.3%; p = 0.003) in the severe disease group (Table 3). Further analysis revealed that severe patients tended to suffer damage to the cardiovascular system (26.7% vs. 9.8%; p = 0.04) and renal function (16.7% vs. 0%; p = 0.003) (Table 3). Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) was proved to be the cell receptor of COVID-19 [7], the same as SARS infection [8]. We performed bioinformatics analysis on the expression of ACE2 receptors in different normal tissues sourced from the cancer microarray database Oncomine, as shown in Additional file 1. The data indicated that the highest level of ACE2 was present in the ileum, followed by in the testis, diaphragm, heart, kidneys, seminal vesicle, colon, and respiratory tract. Hence, we speculated that the high ACE2 expression levels in the ileum, heart, kidneys, and colon caused the virus to pursue direct infection in these specific organs, which might explain the high rate of multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19.\n",

The processing of CT images (Fig. 2a) revealed that the chest presented only scattered dotted shadows on the first day of admission, focal exudation on the fourth day, and diffuse ground-glass shadows on the 13th day. A good example of a case gradually improved with effective therapy is presented in Fig. 2b. In addition, there were patients whose condition progressed rapidly within 1 week (Fig. 2c). On the first day of admission, the chest CT scan was basically normal. However, on the seventh day, the chest CT scan showed patchy high-density shadow and diffused ground glass density shadow in both lungs. Soon after, this patient died of multiple organ failure (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that CT imaging is an important method in differential diagnosis and evaluating the severity of COVID-19.\n",

As Jingzhou ranks among the top three cities that have the most immigrant population from Wuhan but does not confront the same challenges in Wuhan, we contend that the cases described in this paper are more representative of the course of COVID-19. There are two main reasons accounting for the higher mortality rate reported in Wuhan. Although all COVID-19 patients are treated in public hospitals and all expenses are borne by the government, patients in Wuhan could not obtain prompt and adequate treatment as a result of the area hospitals being overloaded with large numbers of patients in a short time. Further, we found that patients in the Jingzhou Central Hospital were often younger, with a median age of 46.0 years relative to that of 56.0 years in Wuhan. Also, there were fewer patients with coexisting chronic diseases in this study, which assisted in lowering the mortality rate [5].",

It took three times to obtain a positive qPCR result for 14.3% of the patients in our study. False negatives often exist during qPCR testing. All patients presented typical CT imaging changes during the study, thus we could establish a clinical diagnosis decision using CT before positive qPCR results were obtained. Hence, CT imaging is a favorable means for diagnosing COVID-19 as well as evaluating the severity of the disease. In sum, the confirmation of COVID-19 should be dependent upon the comprehensive analysis of epidemiological exposure, symptoms, laboratory tests, qPCR, and CT imaging.",

The mechanism of multiple organ damage in the context of COVID-19 infection is currently unclear. The virus enters into the host cells by the recognition of spike glycoproteins. Accumulated evidence has shown that ACE2 is the cell receptor of choice for SARS-CoV-2, same as in the SARS-CoV infection, which means that the virus infects cells expressing ACE2 [8\u201311]. It was also reported that anti-ACE2 therapy blocked coronavirus replication during in vitro experiments [11]. It is even proposed that angiotensin receptor 1 blockers might be a treatment option for SARS [12, 13], but there remains a lack of practice basis in this regard at present. ACE2 was initially thought to be expressed only in the heart, kidneys, and testis, but has now been found to be widely expressed in the lungs, brain, and digestive tract [8\u201310]. These results, together with the bioinformatics analysis in our study, might explain why the COVID-19 caused multiple organ damage. Other possible reasons, including hypoxia caused by respiratory failure and the immune response caused by virus, might also account for the multiple organ damage.",

At the beginning of the disease course, it can be difficult to distinguish the symptoms of patients with COVID-19 from those with influenza. Further, some patients tested positive for influenza virus antibodies, so oseltamivir antiviral therapy was used. In most cases, this drug was used in combination with other antiviral (lopinavir/ritonavir and umifenovir) and antibacterial agents. So far, there are no specific antiviral agents available to treat SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS. More prospective studies on specific antiviral therapy might help overcome this challenge.",

Chen et al. retrospectively analyzed 401 patients, including 249 critically ill patients, showing that glucocorticoids were effective in controlling the inflammatory response caused by SARS [15]. However, the multivariate analysis of another retrospective analysis suggested that corticosteroid therapy was significantly associated with a 20.7 times higher intensive care unit occupancy rate among patients with SARS relative to SARS patients who did not receive corticosteroids [16].
