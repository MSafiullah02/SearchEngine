            "text": "Microfabricated cantilever sensors have attracted much interest in recent years as devices for the fast and reliable detection of small concentrations of molecules in air and solution. In addition to application of such sensors for gas and chemicalvapor sensing, for example as an artificial nose, they have also been employed to measure physical properties of tiny amounts of materials in miniaturized versions of conventional standard techniques such as calorimetry, thermogravimetry, weighing, photothermal spectroscopy, as well as for monitoring chemical reactions such as catalysis on small surfaces. In the past few years, the cantilever-sensor concept has been extended to biochemical applications and as an analytical device for measurements of biomaterials. Because of the label-free detection principle of cantilever sensors, their small size and scalability, this kind of device is advantageous for diagnostic applications and disease monitoring, as well as for genomics or proteomics purposes. The use of microcantilever arrays enables detection of several analytes simultaneously and solves the inherent problem of thermal drift often present when using single microcantilever sensors, as some of the cantilevers can be used as sensor cantilevers for detection, and other cantilevers serve as passivated reference cantilevers that do not exhibit affinity to the molecules to be detected. pick-up, microphone), photoelectric (photodiode, solar cell), electromagnetic (antenna), magnetic (Hall-effect sensor, tape or hard-disk head for storage applications), electrostatic (electrometer), thermoelectric (thermocouple, thermoresistors), and electrical (capacitor, resistor).",

The structures described here are called cantilevers. A cantilever is regarded here as a microfabricated rectangular bar-shaped structure that is longer than it is wide and has a thickness that is much smaller than its length or width. It is a horizontal structural element supported only at one end on a chip body; the other end is free (Fig. 15.1 ). Most often it is used as a mechanical probe to image the topography of a sample using a technique called atomic force microscopy (AFM) or scanning force microscopy (SFM) [ (1) rigid chip body, (2) solid cantilever-support structure, (3) hinge of cantilever, (4) upper surface of the cantilever, which is usually functionalized with a sensor layer for detection of molecules, (5) lower surface of the cantilever, usually passivated in order not to show affinity to the molecules to be detected. The geometrical dimensions, length l, width w and thickness t, are indicated By scanning the tip across a conductive or nonconductive surface using an x-y-z actuator system (e.g. a piezoelectric scanner), an image of the topography is obtained by recording the correction signal that has to be applied to the z-actuation drive to keep the interaction between tip and sample surface constant. SFM methods are nowadays well established in scientific research, education and, to a certain extent, also in industry. Beyond imaging of surfaces, cantilevers have been used for many other purposes. However, here we focus on their application as sensor devices.",

            "text": "The idea of using beams of silicon as sensors to measure deflections or changes in resonance frequency is actually quite old. First reports go back to 1968, when Wilfinger et al. [15.2] investigated silicon cantilever structures of 50 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 8 mm 3 , i. e. quite large structures, for detecting resonances. On the one hand, they used localized thermal expansion in diffused resistors (piezoresistors) located near the cantilever support to create a temperature gradient for actuating the cantilever at its resonance frequency. On the other hand, the piezoresistors could also be used to sense mechanical deflection of the cantilever. This early report already contains concepts for sensing and actuation of cantilevers. In the following years only a few reports are available on the use of cantilevers as sensors, e.g. Heng [15.3] , who fabricated gold cantilevers capacitively coupled to microstrip lines in 1971 to mechanically trim high-frequency oscillator circuits. In 1979, Petersen [15.4] constructed cantilever-type micromechanical membrane switches in silicon that should have filled the gap between silicon transistors and mechanical electromagnetic relays. Kolesar [15.5] suggested the use of cantilever structures as electronic nerve-agent detectors in 1985.",

The cantilever surfaces serve as sensor surfaces and allow the processes taking place on the surface of the beam to be monitored with unprecedented accuracy, in particular the adsorption of molecules. The formation of molecule layers on the cantilever surface will generate surface stress, eventually resulting in a bending of the cantilever, provided the adsorption preferentially occurs on one surface of the cantilever. Adsorption is controlled by coating one surface (typically the upper surface) of a cantilever with a thin layer of a material that exhibits affinity to molecules in the environment (sensor surface). This surface of the cantilever is referred to as the functionalized surface. The other surface of the cantilever (typically the lower surface) may be left uncoated or be coated with a passivation layer, i. e. a chemical surface that does not exhibit significant affinity to the molecules in the environment to be detected. To enable functionalized surfaces to be established, often a metal layer is evaporated onto the surface designed as sensor surface. Metal surfaces, e.g. gold, may be used to covalently bind a monolayer that represents the chemical surface sensitive to the molecules to be detected from environment. Frequently, a monolayer of thiol molecules covalently bound to a gold surface is used. The gold layer is also favorable for use as a reflection layer if the bending of the cantilever is read out via an optical beam-deflection method.",

We will call this process development of compressive surface stress, because the forming self-assembled monolayer produces a downward bending of the cantilever (away from the gold coating). In the opposite situation, i. e. when the cantilever bends upwards, we would speak of tensile stress. If both the upper and lower surfaces of the cantilevers are involved in the reaction, then the situation will be much more complex, as a predominant compressive stress formation on the lower cantilever surface might appear like tensile stress on the upper surface. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that the lower cantilever surface is passivated in order that ideally no processes take place on the lower surface of the cantilever.",

            "text": "To exclude such influences, simultaneous measurement of reference cantilevers aligned in the same array as the sensing cantilevers is crucial [15.11]. As the difference in signals from the reference and sensor cantilevers shows the net cantilever response, even small sensor responses can be extracted from large cantilever deflections without being dominated by undesired effects. When only single microcantilevers are used, no thermal-drift compensation is possible. To obtain useful data under these circumstances, both microcantilever surfaces have to be chemically well defined. One of the surfaces, typically the lower one, has to be passivated; otherwise the cantilever response will be convoluted with undesired effects originating from uncontrolled reactions taking place on the lower surface ( Fig. 15.2a) . With a pair of cantilevers, reliable measurements are obtained. One cantilever is used as the sensor cantilever (typically coated on the upper side with a molecule layer exhibiting affinity to the molecules to be detected), whereas the other cantilever serves as the reference cantilever. It should be coated with a passivation layer on the upper surface so as not to exhibit affinity to the molecules to be detected. Thermal drifts are canceled out if difference responses, i. e. difference in deflections of sensor and reference cantilevers, are taken. Alternatively, both cantilevers are used as sensor cantilevers (sensor layer on the upper surfaces), and the lower surface has to be passivated ( Fig. 15 .2b). It is best to use a cantilever array ( Fig. 15 .2c), in which several cantilevers are used either as sensor or as reference cantilevers so that multiple difference signals can be evaluated simultaneously. Thermal drift is canceled out as one surface of all cantilevers, typically the lower one, is left uncoated or coated with the same passivation layer.",

The light is then reflected off the gold-coated surface of the cantilever and hits the sur-face of a position-sensing detector (PSD). PSDs are light-sensitive photopotentiometer-like devices that produce photocurrents at two opposing electrodes. The magnitude of the photocurrents depends linearly on the distance of the impinging light spot from the electrodes. Thus the position of an incident light beam can easily be determined with micrometer precision. The photocurrents are transformed into voltages and amplified in a preamplifier. As only one PSD is used, the eight lasers cannot be switched on simultaneously. Therefore, a time-multiplexing procedure is used to switch the lasers on and off sequentially at typical intervals of 10-100 ms. The resulting deflection signal is digitized and stored together with time information on a personal computer (PC), which also controls the multiplexing of the VCSELs as well as the switching of the valves and mass flow controllers used for setting the composition ratio of the analyte mixture.",

The transmitted beam is divided in a Wollaston prism into a reference and an object beam. These mutually orthogonally polarized beams are then focused onto the cantilever. Both beams (the reference beam from the hinge region and the object beam from the apex region of the cantilever) are reflected back to the objective lens, pass the Wollaston prism, where they are recombined into one beam, which is then reflected into the other arm of the interferometer, where after the \u03bb/4 plate a phase shift of a quarter wavelength between object and reference beam is established.

In [15.89] a study is published how to prepare polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated microcantilever sensors using a microcapillary pipette assisted method. PEG coating is suitable for ethanol sensing as ethanol quickly forms hydrogen bonds with the OH groups of the PEG. Sensor operation is reported to be reversible and reproducible. In [15.90] artificial neural networks are used for analyte species and concentration identification with polymer coated optically read-out microcantilevers. The analytes detected are carbon dioxide, dichloromethane, diisopropylmethylphosphonate (DIMP), dioxane, ethanol, water, 2-propanol, methanol, trichloroethylene and trichloromethylene. In [15.91] the chemical sensing performance of a silicon reconant microcantilever sensor is investigated in dependence on the thickness of the sensitive coating. For a coating thickness of 1, 4 and 21 \u03bcm of PEUT a limit of detection of 30 ppm was found for ethanol. A new concept of parylene micromembrane array for chemical sensing is presented [15.92] using the capacitive method. The parylene membrane is suspended over a metal pad patterned on the substrate. The pad and part of the membrane that is metal-coated serve as electrodes for capacitive measurement. The top electrode located on the membrane is chemically modified by applying a gold layer and self-assembled thiol monolayers (-COOH, -CH3 and -OH) for detection of analyte molecules. Successful detection of 2-propanol and toluene is reported. In [15.93] a sensitive selfoscillating cantilever array is described for quantitative and qualitative analysis of organic vapor mixtures. The cantilevers are electromagnetically actuated and the resonance frequency is measured using a frequency counter. Sensor response is reproducible and reversible. Using PEUT coating the smallest measured concentration is 400 ppm, but the limit of detection is well below 1 ppm.

Threats can be of chemical, biological, radioactive or explosive nature. Microcantilever sensors are reported to offer very high sensitivities of explosives detection. Photomechanical chemical microsensors based on adsorption-induced and photoinduced stress changes due to the presence of diisopropyl methyl phosphonate (DIMP), which is a model compound for phosphorous-containing chemical warfare agents, and trinitrotoluene (TNT), an explosive are reported [15.97]. Further explosives frequently used include pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), often also with plastic fillers [15.98]. These compounds are very stable, if no detonator is present. Their explosive power, however, is very large, and moreover, the vapor pressures of PETN and RDX are very low, in the range of ppb and ppt. By functionalizing microcantilevers with self-assembled monolayers of 4-mercaptobeonzoic acid (4-MBA) PETN was detected at a level of 1400 ppt and RDX at a level of 290 ppt [15.99]. TNT was found to readily stick to Si surfaces, suggesting the use of microcantilevers for TNT detection, taking advantage of the respective adsorption/desorption kinetics [15.100, 101].

Application of an electrical pulse (10 V, 10 ms) to the piezoresistive cantilever resulted in deflagration of the TNT vapor and a bump in the cantilever bending signal. This bump was found to be related to the heat produced during deflagration. The amount of heat released is proportional to the area of the bump in the time versus bending signal diagram of the process. The deflagration was found to be complete, as the same resonance frequency as before the experiment was observed. The amount of TNT mass involved was determined as 50 pg. The technique was later extended to the detection of PETN and RDX, where much slower reaction kinetics was observed [15.99, 102] . Traces of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) in TNT can also be used for detection of TNT, because it is the major impurity in production grade TNT. Furthermore DNT is a decomposition product of TNT. The saturation concentration of DNT in air at 20 \u2022 C is 25 times higher than that of TNT. DNT was reported detectable at the 300 ppt level using polysiloxane polymer layers [15.103]. Microfabrication of electrostatically actuated resonant microcantilever beams in CMOS technology for detection of the nerve agent stimulant dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP) using polycarbosilane-coated beams [15.104] is an important step towards an integrated platform based on silicon microcantilevers, which besides compactness might also include telemetry [15.105] . Cu 2+ /L-cysteine bilayercoated microcantilever demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity toward organo-phosphorus compounds in aqueous solution. The microcantilever was found to undergo bending upon exposure to nerve agent simulant DMMP at concentrations as low as 10 \u221215 M due to the complexation of the phosphonyl group and the Cu 2+ /L-cysteine bilayer on the microcantilever surface [15.106, 107].",

The interfacial stress of self-assembled monolayers of mercaptohexadecanoic acid and hexadecanethiol depends on pH values and ionic strength [15.39]. SiO 2 and silicon nitride microcantilevers were also found to exhibit a deflection dependence with pH when coated with 4-aminobutyltriethoxysilane, 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid and Au/Al-coated over a pH range 2-12. Aminosilane-modified SiO 2 /Au cantilevers performed robustly over pH range 2-8 (49 nm deflection/pH unit), while Si 3 N 4 /Au cantilevers performed well at pH 2-6 and 8-12 ( ",

The authors have used cantilever in cantilever (CIC) structures, and have observed changes in deflection as gas pressure is varied. At atmospheric pressure, damping is large and the oscillation amplitude is relative small and hysteresis effects are absent. At lower pressure, abrupt changes in the oscillation amplitude occur with changes in the driving frequency.

[15. 168] emphasize that microelectromechanical system pressure sensors will have a wide range of applications, especially in the automotive industry. Piezoresistive cantilever based deflection measurement has major advantages over diaphragms. The pressure range has been extended to 15-1450 Torr by means of design geometry adaptation. Su et al. [15.169] present highly sensitive ultrathin piezoresistive silicon microcantilevers for gas velocity sensing, whereby the deflection increases with airflow distribution in a steel pipe. The detection principle is based on normal pressure drag producing bending of the cantilever. The minimum flow speed measured was 7.0 cm/s, which is comparable to classical hot-wire anemometers. Mertens et al. [15.170] have investigated the effects of temperature and pressure on microcantilever resonance response in helium and nitrogen. Resonance response as a function of pressure showed three different regimes, which correspond to molecular flow, transition regimes and viscous flow, whereby the frequency variation of the cantilever is mainly due to changes in the mean free path of gas molecules. Effects observed allow measurement of pressures between 7.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 7500 Torr. Mortet et al. [15.171] present a pressure sensor based on a piezoelectric bimorph microcantilever with a measurement range between 75 and 6400 Torr. The resonance frequency shift is constant for pressures below 375 Torr. For higher pressures the sensitivity is typically a few ppm/mbar, but depends on the mode number. Sievil\u00e4 et al. [15.172] present a cantilever paddle within a frame operating like a moving mirror to detect the displacements in the oscillating cantilever using a He-Ne laser in a Michelson interferometer configuration, whereby the cantilever acts as moving mirror element in one path of the interferometer. A fixed mirror serves a reference in the other arm of the interferometer.",

The infrared (thermal) image of the source is obtained by rastering a single microfabricated cantilever across the image formed at the focal plane of a concave mirror [15.175-177]. The method has later been refined such that photons are detected using the stress caused by photoelectrons emitted from a Pt film surface in contact with a semiconductor microstructure, which forms a Schottky barrier. The photoinduced bending of the Schottky barrier microstructure is due to electronic stress produced by photoelectrons diffusing into the microstructure [15.178]. The performance of IR imaging via microcantilevers has been enhanced by one-fold leg and two-fold legs beam structures with absorber plates [15.179-181].",

Cleveland et al. [15.7] reported the tracking of cantilever resonance frequency to detect nanogram changes in mass loading when small particles are deposited onto AFM probe tips. Thundat et al. [15.8] showed that the resonance frequency as well as static bending of microcantilevers are influenced by ambient conditions, such as moisture adsorption, and Part B 15.1 that deflection of metal-coated cantilevers can be further influenced by thermal effects (bimetallic effect).

Similar responses are obtained with Pd coated glass cantilevers [15.46] and with Pd coated silicon microcantilevers using dynamic mode [15.47], capacitive readout [15.48] or beam-deflection readout in static mode [15.49]. Vapor First observation of microcantilever resonance frequency detuning is reported in [15.8]. A dependence on relative humidity of ZFM5 zeolites attached to resonating microcantilevers was observed in [15.50]. Relative humidity was measured with an accuracy of 1% using piezoresistive sensors embedded in polymer [15.51]. A detection limit of 10 ppm is achieved using Al 2 O 3 coated microcantilevers [15.52]. Vapors ZFM5 zeolites were used to detect vapor of p-nitroaniline dye in dynamic mode with picogram sensitivity [15.50]. A freon gas sensor using a piezoelectric microcantilever coated with MFI zeolite is described in [15.53]. Ethanol vapor detection in dynamic mode is described in [15.54]. Alkane Thiol Vapors Surface stress changes and kinetics were measured in situ during the self-assembly of alkanethiols on gold by means of a micromechanical sensor, observing scaling of compressive surface stress with the length of the alkane chain [15.13, 55]. 65 ppb of 2-mercaptoethanol have been measured evaluating the response of gold-coated silicon nitride microcantilevers [15.56]. The mechanism of stress formation upon adsorption of thiol layers has been studied by exposing monolayers of alkanethiols on Part B 15.7 gold to low energy Ar ions, resulting in formation of a large tensile stress [15.57]. The influence of surface morphology and thickness of the gold coating of the cantilever is discussed in [15.58, 59]. A multiple-point deflection technique has been used to investigate stress evolution during the adsorption of dodecanethiol on microcantilever sensors, allowing to assess the cantilever bending profile [15.60]. Using gold-coated, piezoelectric-excited, millimetersized cantilevers exposed to 1-hexadecanethiol (HDT) in ethanol, a detection range between 1 fM to 1 mM is claimed [15.61]. The formation of alkanedithiol (HS-(CH)SH) monolayers on gold in solution is monitored using microcantilever sensors [15.62]. The nanomechanical bending of microfabricated cantilevers during the immobilization of alkanethiols of different chain lengths has been investigated in the liquid phase [15.63]. Vapors Detection of mercury vapor was one of the first applications of microcantilever sensors in dynamic mode [15.10]. 20 ppb of Hg vapor was detected using a microcantilever with an integrated piezoelectric film [15.64]. A monolayer of 1,6-hexanedithiol has been identified as a unusually specific recognition agent for CH 3 Hg + [15.65]. 15 ppb detection limit for mercury is reported using microcantilevers that are thermally excited at the fundamental and first three higher order modes [15.66, 67]. Cs ion concentrations in the range of 10 \u221211 -10 \u22127 M were detected using a 1,3-alternate 25,27-bis(11-mercapto-1-undecanoxy)-26,28-calix[4]benzo-crown-6 caesium recognition agent bound to a gold coated microcantilever [15.68]. The crown cavity is highly selective to Cs, as compared to K or Na. An atomic force microscope cantilever has been used as a bending-beam sensor to measure surface stress changes which occur during electrochemical processes, such as the formation of a Pb layer on Au [15.69]. HF and HCN Microcantilevers have been used as a gas sensor to detect hydrofluoric acid (HF) at a threshold of 0.2 ppm [15.70]. Femtomolar HF concentrations, which is also a decomposition component of nerve agents, were detected using a SiO 2 microcantilever. The high sensitivity is considered to be due to the reaction of HF with SiO 2 [15.71]. The etching rate is determined to 0.05 nm/min for SiO 2 and 0.7 nm/min for Si 3 N 4 [15.72]. Sensor responses towards HCN at at concentration of 150 ppm within seconds are reported [15.73]. fied cantilevers significantly [15.74]. Hg 2+ has been measured at a concentration of 10 \u221211 M using a microcantilever coated with gold. Almost no affinity to other cations exists, such as K + , Na + Pb 2+ , Zn 2+ , Ni 2+ , Cd 2+ , Cu 2+ , and Ca 2+ [15.75]. Adsorption characteristics of Ca 2+ ions as a function of concentration in aequous CaCl 2 solution was investigated in static and dynamic mode [15.76]. Microcantilevers functionalized with metal-binding protein AgNt84-6 are able to detect heavy metal ions like Hg 2+ and Zn 2+ , but are insensitive to Mn 2+ [15.77]. Hydrogels containing benzo-18-crown-6 have been used to modify microcantilevers for measurements of the concentration of Pb 2+ in aqueous solutions [15.78]. Using different thiolated ligands as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) functionalized on silicon microcantilevers (MCs) coated with gold allows to detect Cs + , Co 2+ and Fe 3+ [15.79]. A gold coated microcantilever is utilized as the working electrode to detect Cr(VI) [15.80]. Others use 11-undecenyltriethylammonium bromide [15.81] or sol-gel layers [15.82] for detection of Cr(VI).",

            "text": "mM could be detected[15.114]. In another study a detection range between 2 and 50 mM is reported for glucose. No signal is observed for fructose, mannose and galactose[15.115]. Hydrogen peroxide is detected at the nM level using multilayer modified microcantilevers functionalized through a layer-by-layer nanoassembly technique via intercalation of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase. The magnitudes of bending were found to be proportional to the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide[15.116].DNA, RNA Specific DNA hybridization detection was observed via surface stress changes related to transduction of receptor-ligand binding into a direct nanomechanical response of microfabricated cantilevers without the need for external labeling or amplification. The differential deflection of the cantilevers was found to provide a true molecular recognition signal despite large responses of individual cantilevers.Hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides shows that a single base mismatch between two 12-mer oligonucleotides is clearly detectable [15.17]. The findings were confirmed or modeled by several groups [15.117, 118]. Hybridization in a complex nonspecific background was observed in a complement concentration range between 75 nM and 2 \u03bcM [15.40], following Langmuir model kinetics [15.119]. Enzymatic processes were directly Part B 15.7 performed on a microcantilever functionalized with DNA incorporating a Hind III restriction endonuclease site, followed by digestion with Hind III to produce DNA comprising a single-stranded end on the cantilever surface. Ligase was used to couple a second DNA molecule with a compatible end to the DNA on the cantilever [15.120]. Using gold nanoparticle labeled DNA, microcantilevers have been used to detect DNA strands with a specific sequence in dynamic mode, whereby a concentration of 23 pM could still be detected, as well as a single basepair mismatch [15.121]. Whereby adsorption of thiol functionalized single-stranded DNA is easily observed, hybridization cannot be observed if long hydrocarbon spacer molecules between single strand DNA and thiol anchor are used [15.122]. DNA hybridization is also observed using piezoresistive cantilevers [15.119, 123]. A different technique to read out the microcantilever deflections in an array is reported in [15.124]. There the optical beam deflection technique is combined with the scanning of a laser beam illuminating the cantilevers of an array sequentially. DNA hybridization is also reported using polymer SU-8 cantilevers [15.125]. Mukhopadhyay et al. report 20 nM hybridization sensitivity using piezoresistive cantilevers and DNA sequences with an overhang extension distal to the surface [15.126]. A larger array comprising 20 microcantilevers is described in [15.127]. Moreover, the authors present integration of the array with microfluidics. Surface stress changes in response to thermal dehybridization, or melting, is reported [15.128]. The dependence of salt concentration and hybridization efficiency is discussed in [15.129]. Two different DNA-binding proteins, the transcription factors SP1 and NF-kappa B are investigated [15.130]. Phase transition and stability issues of DNA are discussed in [15.131]. Differential gene expression of the gene 1-8U, a potential marker for cancer progression or viral infections, has been observed in a complex background. The measurements provide results within minutes at the picomolar level without target amplification, and are sensitive to base mismatches [15.132].Proteins and Peptides Microfabricated cantilevers were utilized to detect adsorption of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and their oxidized form (oxLDL) on heparin, an to detect adsorption of bovine serum albumine and Immunoglobuline G (IgG) [15.133]. In [15.134] the activity, stability, lifetime and re-usability of monoclonal antibodies to myoglobin covalently immobilised onto microfabricated cantilever surfaces was investigated. Using piezoresistive microcantilevers the interaction of anti-bovine serum albumin (a-BSA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied [15.135]. Continuous label-free detection of two cardiac biomarker proteins (creatin kinase and myoglobin) is demonstrated using an array of microfabricated cantilevers functionalized with covalently anchored anti-creatin kinase and anti-myoglobin antibodies [15.41]. Labelfree protein detection is reported using a microcantilever functionalized with DNA aptamers receptors for Taq DNA polymerase [15.136]. Label-free detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) using resonant frequency shift in piezoresistive cantilevers is described in [15.137], utilizing the specific binding characteristics of CRP antigen to its antibody, which is immobilized with Calixcrown SAMs on Au. Receptors on microcantilevers for serotonin, but insensitive to its biological precursor with similar structure tryptophan are described in [15.138]. Using single chain fragment antibodies instead of complete antibodies allowed to lower the limit of detection to concentrations of about 1 nM [15.139]. In [15.140] detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and C-reactive protein is reported. Detection of the human oestrogen receptor in free and oestradiol-bound conformation can be distinguished [15.141]. The Ca 2+ binding protein calmodulin changes its conformation in presence of absence of Ca 2+ resulting in a microcantilver deflection change [15.142]. No effect is observed upon exposure to K + and Mg 2+ . Detection of activated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is performed in dynamic mode employing a peptide derived from the heat-stable protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) [15.143]. Detection of streptavidin at 1-10 nM concentration is reported using biotin-coated cantilevers [15.144]. Using GST (glutathione-S-transferase) for detection of GST antibodies, a sensitivity of 40 nM was obtained [15.145]. A two-dimensional multiplexed real-time, label-free antibody-antigen binding assay by optically detecting nanoscale motions of two-dimensional arrays of microcantilever beams is presented in [15.146]. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was detected at 1 ng/ml using antibodies covalently bound to one surface of the cantilevers. Conformational changes in membrane protein patches of bacteriorhodopsin proteoliposomes were observed with microcantilevers through prosthetic retinal removal (bleaching) [15.147]. Using an analog of the myc-tag decapeptide, binding of anti-myc-tag antibodies is reported [15.148]. Part B 15.7 Lipid Bilayers, Liposomes, Cells Cantilever array sensors can sense the formation by vesicle fusion of supported phospholipid bilayers of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) on their surface and can monitor changes in mechanical properties of lipid bilayers [15.149]. Liposomes are detected based on their interaction with protein C2A which recognizes the phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on the surface of liposome [15.150]. Individual Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 cell-antibody binding events using microcantilevers operated in dynamic mode are reported [15.151]. The contractile force of self-organized cardiomyocytes was measured on biocompatible poly(dimethylsiloxane) cantilevers, representing a microscale cell-driven motor system [15.152]. Resonanting cantilevers were used to detect individual phospholipid vesicle adsorption in liquid. A resonance frequency shift corresponding to an added mass of 450 pg has been measured [15.153].",

Fifth-mode resonant frequency measurements were performed before and after dipping microcantilever arrays into a static B. subtilis solution showing a substantial decrease in frequency for binding-peptide-coated microcantilevers as compared to that for control peptide cantilevers [15.155].Medical A bioassay of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using microcantilevers has been presented in[15.156], covering a wide range of concentrations from 0.2 ng/ml to 60 \u03bcg/ml in a background of human serum albumin (HSA). Detection has been confirmed by another group using microcantilevers in resonant mode [15.157,158]. The feasibility of detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using microcantilever technology is studied in[15.159]  by showing that the feline coronavirus (FIP) type I virus can be detected by a microcantilever modified by FIP type I anti-viral antiserum. A method for quantification of a prostate cancer biomarker in urine without sample preparation using monoclonal antibodies in described in[15.160].",
