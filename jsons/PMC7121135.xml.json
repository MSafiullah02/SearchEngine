From patients\u2019 contact history, healthcare workers attempt to break the chain of transmission by first tracing the source of infection and then identifying other potential patients exposed to the disease so that they may be monitored and, if necessary, treated (Eames and Keeling, 2003; Rothenberg et al., 2003). Since contact tracing requires intensive manual effort in interviewing patients and collecting their contact records, contact tracing is most effective when the number of infected cases or reproductive ratio of the disease is low (Eames and Keeling, 2003). Contact tracing has been applied to the control of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), Tuberculosis (TB), and some newly emerging diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.",

In the 1960s, for instance, Dr. Havlak suggested that if several syphilis patients share a common sexual contact, their contact tracing records should be kept in one folder and analyzed as a unit or lot (Rothenberg et al., 2003). This \u201clot system\u201d has facilitated the identification of potential STD patients for target screening, and its basic premise is similar to the concept of clusters in Social Network Analysis (SNA) (Rothenberg and Narramore, 1996). However, the consideration of using SNA to enhance contact tracing wasn\u2019t begun until the emergence of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the 1980s; its rapid spread was believed to be related to fast growing sexual networks augmented by the ease of long distance travel. In 1984, Auerbach et al. (1984) initiated a contact investigation of 19 patients in California to assess the role of sexual relationships in AIDS transmission. They eventually linked 40 patients across ten cities in the USA in a network graph and supported the long held hypothesis that AIDS is transmitted via pathogens.",

In 1994, Klovdahl et al.

A socio-matrix can also be visualized as a socio-gram or social network in which individuals are symbolized as nodes and connected to each other with edges or ties for their relationships. Figure 15-1 shows a sample friendship network of ten individuals. In this network, Persons A and E are considered the most active or \u201cpopular\u201d persons since they are linked to the largest number of people. Person F is also important although he/she doesn\u2019t have as many connections as Persons A and E: Person F bridges two different groups of friends. Without Person F, these two groups of people may not have the chance to establish relationships with each other in the future.

From a topological perspective, people who are able to receive or control the mainstream of message flow typically stand in a position similar to the central point of a star (Freeman, 1978/79), such as the location of Person A in the network above. Various centrality measures, such as degree and betweenness, can be employed to determine the importance of a node within a network. For example, the degree is the number of edges that a node has. Since the central point of a star has the largest number of edges connecting it to the other nodes, a node with a higher degree is topologically considered to be more central to its network (Freeman, 1978/79; Wasserman and Faust, 1994). The betweenness measures \u201cthe extent to which a particular node lies between the various other nodes\u201d (Scott, 2000) because the central point also sits between pairs. The higher betweenness a node has, the more potential it has to be a gatekeeper controlling the connections (such as communications) between the others (Scott, 2000). Table 15-1 lists the degree and betweenness of nodes in our sample friendship network. From this table we can see how these measures can reveal the prominence of people in a network.\n\n",

In contrast, macro-level measures reflect a network\u2019s overall structure and are usually used for network-to-network comparison, such as the number of components and network density. A component in graph theory is defined as a maximal-connected sub-graph. Two nodes belong to the same connected component if they are connected directly with an edge or indirectly through other nodes. The number of components consequently shows the number of connected sub-graphs and reflects the degree to which people are grouped in a network (Scott, 2000). The number of components in our sample friendship network is 1. If we remove Person F from the network, its number of components would become 2. Network density is calculated with the proportion of existing edges to the maximum possible edges among nodes (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). If two social networks have the same number of nodes, the network density can differentiate their interaction intensity. According to combinatorics, the maximum possible edges of our sample network totals (10 \u00d7 9)/2 = 45. Its existing edges are 10. Therefore, its network density is 10/45 = 0.2222. The frequently used macro- and micro-level measures are summarized in Table 15-2. It is noted that in some occasions the average value of a micro-level measure can also serve as a macro-level measure. For example, the average degree of nodes can also indicate network participants\u2019 interaction intensity and replace the network density in usage.\n\n",

For STDs, those key individuals are referred to as the core group and bridges (Thomas and Tucker, 1996; Wasserheit and Aral, 1996). The concept of a core group was introduced by Yorke et al. (Yorke et al., 1978) in the 1970s and postulates that epidemics or endemics of an STD are maintained by a small group of sexually active individuals who persistently infect other healthy people. Because of their active sexual life, those core group members inevitably behave like the central point of a star connecting to a large number of others in a contact network and exhibit high values in the degree and betweenness measures. However, the wide spread of an STD requires individuals who, acting as bridges, transfer the disease from one subpopulation to another (Rothenberg and Narramore, 1996; Wasserheit and Aral, 1996). These bridge people may not have many sexual partners, but accidentally channel the disease to a different class of subpopulation (e.g., different economic class) via their purchase of sexual services. Therefore, they may exhibit low degree values but high betweenness.",

Therefore, investigators need to categorize patients into several groups according to their demographic characteristics and then calculate the average values of centrality measures for each group. In the Colorado Springs study, Rothenberg et al. (1995) estimated the relationship of centrality rankings with the perceived risk of AIDS and categorized the behaviors of their participants into six categories: prostitutes, paying and nonpaying partners, injection drug users and their partners, and other. They reported that prostitutes and nonpaying partners who ranked highest in information centrality were more likely to engage in high-risk sexual activities, such as anal sex, and know someone with AIDS. In a separate study of a syphilis outbreak, Rothenberg et al. (1998b) found that people with syphilis were more central within the outbreak network based on their significantly higher betweenness. From the network visualization, they further uncovered that a group of young girls served as the core group of the outbreak by connecting two different ethnic groups of men.",

(1998a) presented results from a longitudinal study in Colorado Springs as an example of the risky behavior perspective. Ninety-six AIDS patients were repeatedly interviewed for 3 Years about their contacts with others, including sexual contact, drug use, and needle sharing. For each type of contact, the researchers constructed three serial contact networks at 1-Year intervals and compared the structure of those serial networks to assess network stability and changes in risky behavior. According to the study results, one group of patients showed a significant decrease in needle sharing based on the gradually smaller average degree and size of components in the group\u2019s contact networks.",

According to their dynamic topology as shown in Figure 15-2, in an early phase of transmission or a growth phase, an STD must first enter a sexual network in which the change rate of sex partners is high enough to allow the STD to establish itself and grow within a subpopulation. With a consistent increase of infected individuals, the disease eventually expands to other subpopulations via bridges: people who have sexual contact with more than one subpopulation.\n\n",

To prove their concept, they constructed a sexual contact network of chlamydial patients in Colorado Springs from 1996 to 1999. They found that while the number of reported cases increased by 55% during this period of time, the network was relatively fragmented and lacked cyclic structures in comparison with an outbreak contact network. These circumstances indicated that the chlamydial transmission was in either a stable or a declining phase. Cunningham et al. (2004) further examined the structural characteristics of a contact network associated with epidemic phases. They compared the structures of two contact networks which respectively represented the periods during and after an epidemic. They reported that after the epidemic, the overall network centrality declined but the component density increased. This finding is consistent with Wasserheit and Aral\u2019s topology that in the decline phase the disease would be restrained in sexual networks that have intensive sexual exchange but limited access to the healthcare system.",

            "text": "Before the Year 2000, SNA studies for disease outbreaks all emerged from the study of STDs. One reason for this could have been the availability of contact tracing data. Compared to other infectious diseases, such as influenza, STDs are heavily dependent on personal connections for transmission and hence can be controlled by contact tracing and taking appropriate intervention actions. Another reason may be related to the capability of network presentation. Since SNA was originally developed to study social phenomena via person-to-person linkage, its network presentation is inherently used to portray the relationships between people and contains only individuals as actors in the network graph. This kind of presentation may be sufficient for STDs but is not sophisticated enough to describe the scenarios of indirect-contact or airborne transmission. Klovdahl et al. (2001) addressed this limitation with their investigation of a tuberculosis (TB) outbreak in Houston, Texas. They first used the conventional presentation of SNA and constructed a person-to-person contact network to analyze the outbreak. However, only 12 personal contacts were identified among the 29 patients. Through further collaboration with local healthcare workers, they found that geographical contact was more important than personal contact in understanding the outbreak. By including places such as bars and restaurants in their contact network, they were finally able to connect those 29 patients directly or indirectly in a network (Klovdahl et al., 2001).",

(2004) also found a positive relationship between attendance at a motel bar and a gonorrhea infection in Alberta, Canada, in 1999 and used a contact network with the motel bar to demonstrate this connection. Based on these studies, many researchers believe that it is important to examine the social context of disease transmission in a contact network. Geographical locations are places of aggregation and create opportunities for social interaction. Including geographical locations in contact networks can not only help to reveal potential places for indirect or casual transmission contact, but can also help to identify social context which groups people and facilitates pathogen transfer.",

All the analyses based on the contact network consequently could be misleading. Second, the qualitative visualization and quantitative measures of SNA are just tools for disease investigators to explore the phenomenon. To understand an outbreak with SNA, the investigators still need to consider many factors, including: environmental and social contexts, patient demographics, disease pathogen characteristics, etc. In addition, they need to interpret those data with their own domain expertise and insights (Rothenberg and Narramore, 1996).",

They started when a municipal hospital in Taipei received a SARS patient without a known source of infection in the middle of April. A week after her admission several healthcare workers gradually developed symptoms. The hospital was reported as having a hospital outbreak on April 22 and closed on April 24. Seven hospitals subsequently reported incidents of nosocomial infection and some suspended their emergency room operations, including a teaching hospital in Taipei. This series of outbreaks were suspected to have been triggered by inter-hospital transfer and the movement of SARS patients (Chu et al., 2005). On July 5, 2003, Taiwan was officially removed from a World Health Organization (WHO) list of SARS-affected areas.",
