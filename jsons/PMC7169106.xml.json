            "text": "A 64\u2010year\u2010old woman residing in a Hong Kong housing estate where there had been a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\n1\n presented in May 2003 with a 4\u2010day history of fluctuating fever up to 39\u00b0C, dry cough with shortness of breath, and diarrhoea. Her past health was unremarkable. On admission, she had right middle zone ground\u2010glass haziness on CXR and a lymphocyte count of 0.3 \u00d7 109/L. She fulfilled the World Health Organization case definition of probable SARS.\n2\n Oral levofloxacin, intravenous ribavirin and methylprednisolone were started in accordance with the standard treatment protocol at our institution (Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong).\n3\n On day 5 (9 days after onset of symptoms), her CXR showed progressive infiltration in both lung fields and she began to require supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. Intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (2 g over 2 days) was then given with gradual improvement in oxygen saturation (97% on supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min). On day 12, she developed recurrent compressing chest discomfort on minimal exertion and oxygen saturation was 86% on supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. An ECG showed new T\u2010wave inversion over the precordial leads. Creatinine kinase and cardiac troponin T levels were normal. She was treated for acute coronary syndrome with antiplatelet and antianginal medications including clopidogrel, subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin, trimetazidine, high\u2010dose atorvastatin, metoprolol, nitrate and amlodipine. In the afternoon, she developed respiratory failure and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for non\u2010invasive ventilatory support. Her condition stabilized over the next 4 days and she was successfully weaned off ventilatory support. However, despite maximized medical treatment, she still complained of recurrent chest pain with reversible ECG changes of T\u2010wave inversion in the precordial leads over the subsequent 6 days. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function with no regional wall motion abnormalities or pericardial effusion. A coronary angiogram was subsequently performed with due infection control precautions, and showed normal coronary arteries. On day 18 (6 days after onset of chest pain), subcutaneous emphysema was found over the right side of her neck. A CXR revealed a band of transradiancy in the upper mediastinum outlining the upper ascending aorta (Fig. 1). On review, this finding was not present in any of the daily CXR taken prior to day 18. High\u2010resolution CT scan (HRCT) of her thorax confirmed the presence of a pneumomediastinum (Fig. 2). Her chest pain gradually subsided with analgesics and the ECG showed normalization of T\u2010waves in the precordial leads during the subsequent convalescent period. She was discharged on day 41 after admission.",

Subsequent clinical signs of subcutaneous emphysema, serial CXR and HRCT led to the diagnosis.",

Severe hypoxaemia secondary to respiratory distress in the absence of coronary artery disease has also been reported to be a cause of reversible T\u2010wave inversion.\n9\n However, our patient had persistent symptoms with reversible ECG changes even after stabilization of respiratory failure and weaning from ventilatory support, making this unlikely.",
