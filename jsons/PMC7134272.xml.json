Existing studies in this area have reported conflicting results on the effect of factors affecting eWOM providing behaviour. For instance, Luarn et al. [11] found that altruism does not affect eWOM providing behaviour, while Cui et al. [12] found that altruism has a significant positive effect on eWOM providing behaviour. Another study by Shen et al. [13] by using surveys found that economic incentives do not have any significant impact on eWOM providing behaviour, while Son et al. [14] found the opposite results-economic incentives positively affect individual\u2019s behaviour to provide eWOM. The mixed findings on the factors affecting eWOM providing behaviour can lead to confusion for scholars and practitioners.",

Thus, the aim of this research is to examine factors affecting eWOM providing behaviour by performing a systematic review and weight analysis of existing research findings. Conducting weight analysis will help to investigate the predictive power of the independent variables on the dependent variables, by taking into account the number of times a relationship has been previously studied. The model developed through the weight analysis will help eWOM practitioners and scholars to focus on more influential factors of eWOM providing behaviour.",

Additionally, studies used various methods for data collection such as surveys or data mining [19, 20]. Studies applied a number of theories to study factors affecting eWOM providing behaviour such as social exchange theory, motivational theory and Uses and Gratification theory to name a few [17]. Based on the literature review 21 factors which affect eWOM providing behaviour were identified (see Table 1).",

As a result, the weight significance of a relationship between these two constructs is calculated by dividing 8 by 13, which gives 0.615. If weight is equal to 1 it indicates that the relationship between two constructs is significant across all studies, while a weight equal to 0 shows this relationship is non-significant throughout all examined studies (Jeyaraj et al.

It is proposed by Jeyaraj et al. [39] that justification for continuing to examine such predictors should be convincing. Nevertheless, it may be premature to exclude such predictors given that eWOM providing behaviour research is still emerging as far as the empirical aspects and solid theoretical foundations of this research are concerned. Out of the total 21 examined relationships only nine were found to be studied five or more times (influence of others, tie strength, information influence, economic incentive, altruism, involvement, self-enhancement, customer satisfaction, and trust in web eWOM services), which proposes that eWOM research is still not that well developed. Moreover, some researchers propose that weight analysis may not be a sufficient reason to exclude any variables from further analysis (Rana et al. [40]). None of the predictors was found to be the worst predictors of intention to engage in eWOM communications.",
