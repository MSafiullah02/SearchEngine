Chemokines constitute a class of cytokines that regulate migration of leucocytes to sites of infection. In this work, the expression and function of CC chemokine receptor (CCR)1 and CCR5 and their ligands during a generalized herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in mice were studied. Many CCR1 and CCR5 ligands were expressed in infected organs after intraperitoneal infection. In particular, CC chemokine expression in the liver preceded the expression of CCR1 and CCR5, suggesting recruitment of cells bearing these receptors, which correlated with a decrease in viral titres. Administration of Met-RANTES, a CCR1 and CCR5 antagonist, led to impaired antiviral response with significantly higher viral titre in the liver on days 1 and 6 after infection. This observation was accompanied by a decreased and shortened recruitment of natural killer cells to the peritoneum of infected mice treated with the antagonist. Despite this reduced recruitment of antiviral leucocytes in mice receiving Met-RANTES, peritoneal cells from these mice produced markedly enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Altogether, the results suggest that CCR1 and/or CCR5 are important for both viral clearance and eventual control of the immune response.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Establishment of an efficient immune response to infections is highly dependent on rapid recruitment of cells of the immune system to infected areas. In this process, chemokines play a pivotal role [1, 2] . Chemokines constitute a group of small, secreted peptides with chemotactic and pro-inflammatory activities. They are classified into CC, CXC, C and CX 3 C chemokines, based on the numbers and mutual placement of cysteines in the N-terminal region of proteins [3] . Chemokine receptors are seventransmembrane spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed primarily on leucocytes [1, 4] . The pattern of chemokine receptor expression is highly cell type dependent and is also affected by the state of differentiation and activation of the cells [5, 6] . Many chemokine receptors can bind several different chemokines, and likewise, most chemokines can work as ligand for more than one receptor. For instance, CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 1 is a receptor for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a/CCL3 and MIP-1g/CCL9, regulated upon activation, normally T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)/ CCL5 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3/ CCL7, whereas CCR5 serves as a receptor for CCL3, MIP-1b/CCL4, CCL5 and MCP-2/CCL8 [3, 7] . Although chemokines were first recognized as chemotactic molecules for leucocytes [8] , more recently, a number of other functions have been elucidated. These include leucocyte activation, induction of cytokine and chemokine expression, leucocyte degranulation and also developmental roles [3, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 202, "end": 204, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 466, "end": 469, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 596, "end": 599, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 600, "end": 602, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 761, "end": 764, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 765, "end": 767, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1249, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1252, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1340, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1548, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1552, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1557, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1567, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1572, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Chemokines have been demonstrated to play beneficial as well as deleterious roles in many kinds of diseases and pathologic conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases and transplant rejections [2, 3, 14, 15] . Concerning the role of chemokines in host defence against viral infections, most attention has been drawn to CCR1 and CCR5 and their ligands, because these receptors seem to be associated with a T helper 1 (Th1)-type of immune response, which is generally considered to be protective against viruses [16] [17] [18] . Using mice deficient in specific genes of the chemokine system, it has been shown that CCL3 and CCR1 are important for resistance against certain viral infections [19, 20] . Also, CCR5 deficiency in humans increases the susceptibility to hepatitis C virus infections [21] , and mice lacking this receptor display increased mortality rate after influenza virus infection [22] . However, lack of CCR5 can also be associated with beneficial modulation of the immune response, as evidenced by other studies in CCR5-deficient (CCR5 -/-) mice. Infection with a neurotropic coronavirus resulted in reduced demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS), which correlated with reduced recruitment of macrophages into the brain of CCR5 -/when compared with wild-type mice [23] .

NK cells have long been recognized to represent a major mediator of early defence against many viruses, including herpesviruses [44] . In our studies, we found that expression of CCL5 was induced in the liver and peritoneal cavity (seen at the levels of both mRNA and protein) after HSV-2 infection and, weakly, in brain and spleen after HSV-2 infection (found at the level of mRNA but not protein). CCL3 expression was induced in the peritoneal cavity (mRNA and protein) but only weakly in the brain (mRNA not protein) and not in detectable amounts in the liver or spleen. The induction of, notably, CCL5, but also some of the other chemokines examined, was detected immediately prior to, or coincident with, peak leucocyte numbers in the peritoneum as well as upregulation of CCR1 and CCR5 in the liver and spleen, an indication of accumulation of immune cells bearing these receptors. Also, in the liver, the elevation in cells expressing CCR1 and CCR5 correlated with a decrease in viral titres.

In vitro, Met-RANTES has been shown to antagonize the chemotactic effect of CCL3 and CCL5 on T cells, monocytes and eosinophils [29, 45, 46] . In vivo, murine studies have focused on the effect of Met-RANTES on inflammatory diseases, e.g. experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, and results have shown some effect on clinical and inflammatory parameters [47] [48] [49] . As to infections, Stumbles and colleagues [50] found that treatment with Met-RANTES in rats inhibited dendritic cell (DC) influx to tracheal epithelium in response to bacterial challenge but had no effect on the DC response to Sendai virus infection. We found that co-treatment with Met-RANTES led to significantly higher HSV-2 titres in liver on day 1 and day 6 after infection. In particular, the marked reduction in viral titres in the liver between day 3 and day 6 in HSV-2-infected BALB/c mice, which correlates with our finding that CCR1 and CCR5 were upregulated between days 3 and 6, was less pronounced in infected mice co-treated with Met-RANTES. This could indicate that recruitment of a CCR1 \u00fe /CCR5 \u00fe cell population is important for mounting an efficient antiviral response in the liver. However, T-cell migration to the liver was not affected, and accumulation of NK cells was increased in Met-RANTES-treated mice 6 days after infection (S\u00f8rensen and Paludan, unpublished data). Another possible explanation for the increased viral titres in the liver could be a higher viral load delivered to the liver, owing to impaired initial antiviral response in the peritoneal cavity, where accumulation of NK cells and granulocytes was significantly decreased on day 1. Both these cell types have been documented to possess antiviral activity towards HSV [44, [51] [52] [53] . Third, direct chemokinemediated activation of antiviral mechanisms in the liver, e.g. activation of Kupffer's cells, may also have been blocked by Met-RANTES. Higher viral titres were also detected in the brain (day 6) and spleen (days 3 and 6), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Again, the reason could be increased viral load delivered to organs, owing to impaired initial response in the peritoneal cavity. However, the blocked CCR5 activity in the brain could also be important, as CCR5 has been shown to have a role in the antiviral response and virusmediated pathology in CNS as well as immunity to nonviral pathogens in CNS [23, 54] . Altogether, our results show that Met-RANTES, which blocks CCR1 and CCR5, impairs the antiviral response to a generalized HSV-2 infection. CCR1 and CCR5 have been previously found to contribute to antiviral defence in respiratory infection with PVM [20] . In other viral infections, however, CCR1 and CCR5 have not been found to play important roles in antiviral response. For instance, CCR1 deficiency had no effect on titres or leucocyte migration in respiratory syncytial virus infection [55] , and viral titres were also unaffected by CCR5 deficiency in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in mice [56] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 223, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 224, "end": 227, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 228, "end": 231, "text": "46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 482, "end": 486, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 487, "end": 491, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 492, "end": 496, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 541, "end": 545, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1865, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1866, "end": 1870, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1875, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1880, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2547, "end": 2551, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2552, "end": 2555, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2807, "end": 2811, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3049, "end": 3053, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3169, "end": 3173, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Co-treatment with HSV-2 \u00fe Met-RANTES also resulted in significantly elevated expression of inflammatory mediators in PCs as compared with PCs from mice given HSV-2 alone. This observation could be explained by alternations in important regulatory mechanisms following treatment with Met-RANTES, hence suggesting immunoregulatory roles for CCR1 and CCR5. Alternatively, it could simply be a cellular response to ongoing viral replication and increased antigen load in mice co-treated with Met-RANTES. However, we did not detect virus in the peritoneal cavity at day 6 after infection of either mouse infected with HSV-2 alone or after co-treatment with Met-RANTES (data not shown). Moreover, the literature and our results argue against prolonged presence of virus as responsible for the elevated production of pro-inflammatory mediators. First, IFN-a/b production was upregulated only on day 1 in mice given HSV-2 \u00fe Met-RANTES, contrary to a more sustained expression expected if the infection persisted in the peritoneum. Second, studies from this laboratory have shown that the capacity of HSV-2 to induce the production of IFN-a/b in PCs is independent of viral replication [57] , thus arguing that not even viral antigen is present in the peritoneal cavity day 6 after infection. Finally, studies by other groups have indicated important immunoregulatory roles for CCR1 and CCR5 in infection with viral and nonviral pathogens [12, 56, 58, 59] . For instance, it was demonstrated that CCR5-deficient mice display enhanced macrophage infiltration, tissue damage and mortality after influenza virus infection, despite unchanged viral titres, hence strongly indicating a possible regulatory role for CCR5 [22] . Also, regulatory T cells express CCR5 and are recruited to inflamed areas by the ligands of this receptor to participate in the regulation of the immune response [60] .
