            "text": "Baculovirus expression systems are widely used to allow for the expression of recombinant proteins (1). The Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system (2) is often preferred as it is a rapid system where purified recombinant baculo-viruses can be positively identified within 2 wk (3). The popularity of the system has further increased because the techniques used to isolate and purify the recombinant virus are relatively simple. A further advantage of insect cells is that they can fold, modify, traffic, and assemble newly synthesized polypeptides to form authentic, soluble end products (4\u20136). However, although the baculovirus-insect cell system has protein processing capabilities similar to those of higher eukaryotes, the insect protein processing pathways are not necessarily equivalent to those of higher eukaryotes (1). A good example of a similar but distinct processing pathway is the protein N-glycosylation pathway. Studies have shown that although insect cells could assemble N-glycans and transfer them to growing polypeptides, they have an unusual end-processing activity that trims an intermediate (common to both insect and mammalian pathways) to the insect-specific paucimannose end product (7). Nevertheless, baculovirus expression of viral proteins has been successfully used for the study of numerous viruses (1). This system has been particularly useful in the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) to study viral assembly processes and in several cases like the human papillomavirus and hepatitis C virus, such VLPs have been used in vaccine development (8,9). Another important application is the production of glycosylated viral antigens for immunization and protection against viral infection, for example, influenza A viral antigens expressed using baculovirus have been evaluated as potential vaccine candidates (10,11).",

            "text": "The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which affected more than 30 countries across five continents, has profoundly disturbed social and economic activities globally. A novel coronavirus, termed the SARS-coronavirus (CoV), was identified as the etiological agent of SARS (12). The SARS-CoV genome is nearly 30 kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) (13,14). Five of these ORFs encode for genes that are homologous to proteins found in all known coronaviruses, namely the replicase gene 1a/1b and the four structural proteins, nucleocapsid, spike, membrane (M), and envelope (E), whereas the remaining nine ORFs encodes for accessory proteins, varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids, which are unique to SARS-CoV. The largest of these accessory proteins is termed 3a (also known as U274, X1, or ORF3). Antibodies specific for 3a have been found in convalescent patients (15,16) and 3a has also shown to be expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells (17\u201319). 3a is a novel coronavirus structural protein as it is associated with virion purified from SARS-CoV-infected cells and it is incorporated into VLPs when co-expressed with M and E in the baculovirus system (20,21). 3a is predicted to have three transmembrane domains (13,14) and when it is expressed on the cell surface, its N-terminus is facing the extracellular matrix whereas the C-terminus is facing the cytoplasm (19). It has also been reported that 3a is O-linked glycosylated, and this posttranslation modification may be important for its incorporation into virion (22,23). The formation of a recombinant baculovirus expressing the 3a protein fused with a myc-tag at the N-terminus will be used to illustrate the methods used to express this protein using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system.",

As has been observed for other coronaviruses, the co-expression of two of the SARS-CoV structural proteins, M and E, is sufficient for the formation of VLPs. The M protein is a triple-panning membrane glycoprotein that interacts with the nucleocapsid and spike protein during virion assembly (26). The small E protein has more recently been recognized as an essential structural component of the coronavirion. A large portion of this protein is embedded within the viral membrane; only its hydrophilic carboxy terminus protrudes inside the virion (27,28). Nal and co-workers recently showed that the SARS-CoV M protein is N-glycosylated, whereas the SARS-CoV E protein is not glycosylated (29). Recombinant viruses expressing M and E respectively will be used to form VLPs. The co-expression will be shown by Western blot analysis, and the formation of VLPs will be shown by transmission electron microscopy.",

The transformation mix was then incubated at 37\u00b0C at 225 rpm for 4 h.After the 4-h incubation, 10-fold serial dilutions of the E. coli DH10Bac transformation mix were prepared to a dilution factor of 10\u22123. One hundred microlitres of individual dilutions were plated onto LB agar plates containing 50 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin, 7 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin, 10 \u00b5g/mL tetracycline, 100 \u00b5g/mL X-gal, and 40 \u00b5g/mL IPTG (see\nNote 2). Plates were then incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C.To confirm the white phenotype, 10 white colonies were restreaked onto the same selection agar plates. These plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h.Once the phenotype was confirmed, a single colony was chosen and grown in LB media containing 50 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin, 7 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin, and 10 \u00b5g/mL tetracycline.The bacmid DNA was then isolated following the instructions of the QIAgen Midiprep Handbook.Because of the large size of the bacmid DNA, restriction enzyme analysis is not recommended. The PCR using the M13 Forward (\u221240) and M13 Reverse primers is ideal to verify that the isolated bacmid DNA contain the gene of interest, because the bacmid contains these primer sites flanking the mini-attTn7. PCR fragments were amplified using a combination of various primers: 3a reverse and 3a forward primers (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3), M13 Reverse and 3a forward primers (Fig. 2, lane 4), or 3a reverse and M13 Forward (\u221240) primers (Fig. 2, lane 5). The pFastBac1-myc-3a and the pXJ40myc-3a plasmids were used as positive controls for the PCR reaction and sterile distilled water was used as a negative control. For each primer set, a 50-\u00b5L standard PCR reaction was set up. The annealing temperature and extension time of a PCR cycle varied, depending on the primer combination. PCR fragments were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis using standard procedures (31) (see\nNote 3).\n\n",

While the cells were attaching, 1 \u00b5g of Midiprep bacmid DNA was added to 100 \u00b5L of unsupplemented Grace\u2019s medium (Invitrogen) in a 1.5-mL microfuge tube (tube A). Six microliters of Cellfectin reagent was diluted in 100 \u00b5L of unsupplemented Grace\u2019s Medium in a separate 1.5-mL microfuge tube (tube B). The contents of tube A were added to the contents of tube B, and the solution was gently mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Five minutes before the incubation time had expired, the Sf-900 II SFM medium was removed from the cells, and the cells were washed once with 2 mL of unsupplemented Grace\u2019s Medium after which the wash media was removed. A volume of 0.8 mL of unsupplemented Grace\u2019s Medium was added to the DNA-lipid complex, and this solution was added to the Sf9 cells.The cells were incubated at 27\u00b0C incubator for 5 h, then the incubation media was removed and 2 mL of the complete growth media was added to the cells. The six-well plates were then incubated in a 27\u00b0C humidified incubator for 72 h (see\nNote 5).The baculovirus infection cycle is characterized by a bi-phasic replication cycle during which two virion phenotypes are produced: (I) Occlusion derived virions (ODV) and (II) budded virus (BV) (33). Posttransfection, BV is usually released into the medium after 3 d. Depending on the transfection efficiency, a longer time period might be required to view the cytopathic effects (CPE). Some common CPE as time progresses, include enlarged nuclei, detachment, and finally cell lysis. Once CPE has been observed, the media from the wells were collected and transferred to a centrifuge tube.The media was then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C.Aliquots of the supernatant, which constitute the P1 viral stock, was then transferred to sterile dark microfuge tubes, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C (see\nNote 6)The P1 viral stock can be used to generate a viral stock of higher titer and volume. 1 \u00d7 107\nSf9 cells were added to 10 mL of Sf-900 II SFM medium and incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow for cell attachment.One milliliter of media was then removed and replaced with 1 mL of P1 viral stock, to allow for a final volume of 10 mL (see\nNote 7). The cells were then incubated for 48\u201372 h (until CPE was detected) in a 27\u00b0C humidified incubator.After the incubation period, the media was collected and transferred to a centrifuge tube. The media was then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C.Aliquots of the supernatant were then transferred to sterile dark microfuge tubes, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.The P2 viral stock titer was determined by a plaque assay, as outlined ref.\n5.

This could be done using a toothpick or sterile yellow tip to pick a colony and submerge the colony into the PCR mix. The fragment can then be amplified using a PCR program that is optimum for the primer combination, with the exception being an extended initial denaturation time. The primer combination used within the PCR can be specific for the gene of interest, or specific for priming sites on the pFastBac1 vector which flank the multiple cloning site (pFastBac_Fwd: 5\u2032ACCATCTCGCAAATAAAG3\u2032 and pFastBac_Rev: 5\u2032AACAACAATTGCATTCATTTT3\u2032).When preparing the multiple antibiotic plates, the tetracycline concentration was increased from 10 \u00b5g/mL to 15 \u00b5g/mL. This was done to decrease the amount of satellites colonies obtained. After the 48-h incubation, plates were incubated at 4\u00b0C. This allowed for an enhancement of the blue colonies, which allowed for a more defined distinction between white and blue colonies.The amplicon size between the two universal primers on the bacmid DNA is 2.3 kb when no gene is inserted. If the gene of interest together with the bacmid DNA is greater than 4 kb, it is recommended that a Taq polymerase such as the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche) (38) is used, which will allow for amplification of larger fragments.It is generally assumed that a confluent 25-cm2 flask of Sf9 cells contains approx 1 \u00d7 107 cells. These cells, diluted in 10 mL of media, will then contain 1 \u00d7 106 cell/mL.It is important to note that insect cells are not incubated in a CO2 incubator but in a normal humidified incubator at 27\u00b0C. It is possible to obtain a slower growth at 19\u201322\u00b0C, but it is not advisable to exceed the temperature of 28\u00b0C, because the insect cells do not grow well at higher temperatures. Also, it is extremely hard for the cells to recover once they have been placed under stress.Repeated freeze-thaw cycles of virus samples are not recommended, as this can decrease titer. It is therefore recommended that a working stock of recombinant virus be stored at 4\u00b0C. Virus stocks can safely be stored this way, without loss of titer, for a least a year.Assuming that the P1 viral stock has a titer of 1 \u00d7 106 pfu/mL, the number of cells to be infected is 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL (1 \u00d7 106 cells in 10 mL of media) and the MOI required is 0.1 pfu/mL, it can be calculated that 1 mL of the P1 viral inoculum is required.For a quick scan of VLPs, after the lysed cells have been separated from the cell debris, it is possible to place an aliquot of the clarified supernatant onto a formvar coated copper grid, stain the grid with PTA and view immediately by transmission electron microscopy.\n",
