A large and growing literature in behavioral economics has identified and explored this discrepancy between decision utility (which informs choice) and experienced utility (which is the basis for welfare) (Benjamin et al., 2012, Berridge and Aldridge, 2008, Comerford, 2011, De Vos et al., 2016, Kahneman et al., 1997, Read, 2007). For example, some people live far away from their workplaces and yet travel to work by car and public transport despite happiness research indicating that long commutes in motorized modes are one of the least satisfying daily activities (Kahneman et al., 2004, Lanc\u00e9e et al., 2017, Stone and Schneider, 2016). Furthermore, these low levels of travel satisfaction can spill over to low levels of life satisfaction (De Vos, 2019a, Friman et al., 2017, Olsson et al., 2013, Stutzer and Frey, 2008).1\nSuch findings suggest that choices (e.g. about transportation modes) alone offer only a limited perspective to fully understand the welfare consequences of our behavior (Hausman, 2012, Infante et al., 2016, Sugden, 2018). Hence, policy-makers who are interested in increasing people\u2019s welfare when traveling need additional information to better inform transport policy design.2\n",

            "text": "Over the last decade, a growing group of scholars, including transportation researchers, have argued that subjective well-being can be used as a welfare measure to inform policy (Dolan and White, 2007, Friman et al., 2018, Layard, 2006). Subjective well-being is often defined as an experienced momentary feeling, and diary studies or other naturalistic monitoring tools are used to measure it (Kahneman et al., 2004, Shiffman et al., 2008). Arguably the most common finding from the literature on experienced subjective well-being in the transport context is that people who travel actively (i.e., who walk or cycle) are more satisfied with their travel than people who drive and/or use public transport (De Vos, 2018, De Vos, 2019b, De Vos et al., 2013, Ettema et al., 2011, Friman et al., 2017, Lanc\u00e9e et al., 2017, Smith, 2017, Westman et al., 2017). However, it is not yet clear why this is the case. For example, De Vos (2019b) reviews the literature on differences in travel satisfaction across travel modes and notes that \u201cstudies on travel satisfaction barely give explanations for these differences; and when they do, these explanations are not empirically founded and therefore not entirely convincing\u201d (p. 15).",

We initially assess whether active travel (walking and cycling) is ranked as more satisfying than motorized travel (driving and public transport) amongst the 4134 participants whose last commute was to the main campus. Thereafter we aim to explain the differences in travel satisfaction across travel modes by empirically investigating the effects of starting time of travel, duration of travel, distance of travel, subjectively assessed characteristics of the trip, social interaction during travel, and demographic variables. We also test whether living close to bus stops, using a real-time information app about bus departures, and parking difficulties on campus are associated with travel satisfaction. Finally, we test for associations between travel satisfaction and geospatial information on the location from which participants started their trip, focusing on economic deprivation and the accessibility to transport at that location.",

We also find that the duration of the trip depends on the starting time of the trip (a rush-hour effect) and use these insights to formulate an ambitious policy proposal: delaying the starting schedule of universities would deliver higher trip satisfaction ratings, whilst simultaneously easing pressure on transport infrastructure and services during the morning peak commute.",

The most common is the Satisfaction with Travel Scale (STS) introduced by Ettema et al. (2011).4\nThe STS consists of nine question items that allow answers on a scale from \u22123 to 3 with a higher score implying higher satisfaction (De Vos et al., 2015, Friman et al., 2013). The STS measures three sub-components of travel satisfaction with three questions each. The first two sub-components deal with affect and differentiate between valence and activation as suggested by the Swedish Core Affect Scale (SCAS) (V\u00e4stfj\u00e4ll et al., 2002). They measure feelings from negative activation to positive deactivation (\u201cstressed to calm\u201d, \u201cworried to confident\u201d, and \u201churried to relaxed\u201d) and from negative deactivation to positive activation (\u201cbored to enthusiastic\u201d, \u201ctired to alert\u201d, and \u201cfed up to engaged\u201d). The third sub-component is cognitive evaluation, which is measured by the following three items: \u201cthe trip was the worst/best I can think of\u201d; \u201cthe trip was very low/high standard\u201d; and \u201cthe trip did not work out/worked out well\u201d.",

Mokhtarian et al. (2015) find that urban residents consider trips less tiring, but also less pleasant compared to non-urban residents. Other studies do not find direct associations between the residential location and travel satisfaction (Mokhtarian and Pendyala, 2018, Ye and Titheridge, 2017). In a sample of walkers, Manaugh and El-Geneidy (2013) do not find associations between travel satisfaction, distance, and elevation change.

There are also studies that do not find significant associations between gender and travel satisfaction (Carrel et al., 2016). A number of studies show that positive attitudes towards travelling predict higher satisfaction with travel, especially when the attitudes are mode-specific (Cao and Ettema, 2014, De Vos, 2018, Ye and Titheridge, 2017). Also moods such as feeling happy, relaxed and angry predict travel satisfaction (Gao et al., 2017). Some studies find that people with pro-environmental attitudes are more satisfied with active modes of travel (Manaugh and El-Geneidy, 2013) and that personality traits, such as being critical and being easy-going, predict travel satisfaction (Gao et al., 2017).",

Commuters who use the car tend to arrive early on campus in order to find a free parking spot. Moreover, levels of congestion in the city are high, and a report suggests that only in Bogota and Rome do commuters lose more time in congestion.7\nCommuting to the campus by bike is sometimes perceived as unsafe and inconvenient because bike lanes are shared with buses for long stretches of road or end somewhat abruptly. Commuting to the campus on foot is possible for those living close to the campus as footpaths are provided in all built-up areas. In terms of public transport, the bus network is described as discontinuous and the attractiveness of bus journeys is reduced by delays caused by a small number of choke points across the road network (NTA, 2016).",

The map suggests that the distance to UCD is an important geographical determinant of travel satisfaction.

This procedure allowed us to calculate the distance for 3970 trips. The mean distance of these trips is 13.5 km (SD: 19.03 km; Min: 0.15 km; Max: 130.44 km). There are substantial differences in distance across the main travel mode people used.

For walking and biking, adding trip duration reduces predicted travel satisfaction ratings to 0.553 (95% CIs: 0.446, 0.661) and 0.416 (95% CIs: 0.330, 0.503), respectively. For the train and the bus, travel satisfaction increases to 0.336 (95% CIs: 0.190, 0.482) and 0.031(95% CIs: \u22120.035, 0.097), respectively. The reason for these changes is that active travel tends to be relatively short and public transport trips tend to be long (see Fig. 3) and that travel duration itself is a strong and significant predictor of trip satisfaction overall (see Table 3, model 2). For example, based on model 2, the predicted travel satisfaction for trips lasting less than 15 min is 0.715 (95% CIs: 0.616, 0.814) and the predicted travel satisfaction for trips lasting more than an hour is \u22120.488 (95% CIs: \u22120.568, \u22120.408).13\nOnce the differences in travel duration are controlled for, active travel is less good and public transport is less bad, suggesting that one main advantage of active travel is its short duration and that one main disadvantage of public transport is its long duration.",

People are more satisfied with their trips when they come from a more affluent area. This association is in the expected direction as the campus is in an affluent area of the city and people are more satisfied with shorter trips.

Going beyond showing these associations, our study empirically investigates why travel satisfaction differs across travel modes. As highlighted by De Vos (2019b), \u201cno study up till now has been able to indicate why travel satisfaction levels differ according to the chosen travel mode\u201d (p. 15). He argues that the strong effects of travel mode on travel satisfaction typically found in the literature are likely to be overestimated. We show, for example, that the duration of the trip explains why people prefer car trips over public transport trips: If both trip types had the same duration, people would prefer using public transport in our sample. Our findings thus suggest that it is essential for future studies to control for trip duration when examining differences in travel satisfaction across travel modes. While De Vos (2019b) suggests that attitudes towards travel modes mediate the mode effect on travel satisfaction, we show empirically that trip duration is also an important mediator. However, travel mode remains a significant predictor of travel satisfaction in our data even after controlling for many variables (such as the duration of the trip). But if we had also controlled for (unavailable) data on people\u2019s attitudes towards travel modes, the travel mode effects on travel satisfaction might be even more attenuated.",

As can be seen in Fig. 3, in our data commutes from suburban areas are less satisfying than commutes from urban areas. However, once we controlled for various variables, including duration of the commute, this effect reversed. This suggests that the inclusion of duration-related variables in the regression models might explain the differences found across studies in the previous literature. We also incorporate more specific geospatial determinants of the commute \u2013 specifically the economic deprivation and accessibility of the location where the trip started and present some associations of these variables with travel satisfaction.

For example, the National Transport Authority of Ireland is proposing to re-design the Dublin bus network over the coming years to make bus journeys faster, more predictable, and more reliable.16\nWhere these investments and actions can shorten trip durations, there should be a further stimulus for modal shift to active and mass transit modes. However, the findings of this paper also suggest that it may be useful to establish a general ambition for the reduction of trip journey times within a reasonable radius to less than 45 min, on the basis of this representing a clear threshold point for trip satisfaction ratings.17\n",

This insight and the overall findings in this paper lead us to consider an ambitious short-term initiative that could reduce journey times for commuters to the campus, ease pressure on the morning peak transport and travel infrastructure, and potentially encourage more non-motorized and mass transit mode choices. Specifically, we would recommend that the universities consider the introduction of a newly regulated schedule that ensures classes, coursework, and most meetings do not commence before 10 am. The anticipated impact of shifting more than 30,000 staff and students to a deferred starting hour would be to reduce associated commutes during the peak travel times. Related initiatives, compatible with the systems and skillsets developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, could also see increased options into the future for remote participation in meetings and classes. These measures could contribute to reduced road congestion and potentially increased safety for cyclists and pedestrians. The reduced commuting on public transport in the busiest period of the morning, would ease pressure on public transport service capacity and open up opportunities for other commuters (e.g. 9\u20135 city center workers) to consider a shift to public transport. There are of course recognizable challenges that range from motorists continuing to travel early to secure parking spaces, to challenges for the campus population relating to their own personal scheduling of commitments and activities such as picking up children, doing groceries, going to leisure activities, etc. However, an initial response may suggest complementary parking strategies, and a recognition that young university students are likely amongst the most flexible of all morning commuters. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a global understanding of what is possible in regard to remote working and learning. While a more detailed analysis of these policy proposals would need to be conducted, our results provide an important contribution to such analyses.",

For example, the finding that people are more satisfied with active than passive travel could reflect that people who are generally more satisfied with things are particularly likely to use active travel modes. Moreover, other, unobserved variables could explain both travel mode choice and travel satisfaction. Further research is needed in order to identify the direction of causality by either including travel satisfaction questionnaires in experimental designs, evaluating natural experiments, or making use of econometric techniques to allow us to infer causality from observational data. As a first step, it would be helpful to have the same study respondent rate a higher number of trips made with different travel modes in order to control for individual-specific fixed effects. Such studies are more burdensome for participants to complete, and as a result, they will likely have smaller sample sizes. Nonetheless, we believe that it is an important step for research in this area that could also identify further associations with travel satisfaction, such as weather and the time of the year.",

However, the methodology could be applied more broadly, with a view to the development of a city-wide travel satisfaction index. Many national authorities run travel surveys as part of their national census and adding a question on travel satisfaction for each trip would provide valuable information that could be used to develop a dynamic index that could monitor travel satisfaction and thereby inform policy-makers of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the travel infrastructure in their city.",

National ambitions relating to reduced GHG emissions, improved ambient air quality, and better citizen health and well-being could benefit from these policies. There are surmountable complexities relating to the design of such schemes, as well as a number of interactions and outcomes that would influence the degree to which the initiative may reduce emissions. Nonetheless, the primary motivation for the measure would be to reduce travel time, ease pressure on peak transport services, and enhance travel satisfaction for all. In order to advance this proposal, we would recommend further research on the policy design, with a potential ex-ante ex-post case study utilizing selected University units as a precursor to the possibility of a campus-wide measure.",
