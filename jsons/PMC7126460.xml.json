Additionally, severe dengue, Streptococcus suis infection and the increase in antibiotic resistance are other major causes of sepsis in critical care units across Vietnam [12], [13], [14]. Because of Vietnam's regional prominence (size, population) and experiences with clinical management of emerging infections, it is in an opportune position to help understand the gaps (i.e. structural, processes, outcomes) and develop solutions (i.e. health system planning, modified guidelines, intervention trials, quality improvement) to improve the critical care management of patients with SARI and sepsis.",

The hospitals statistics are official regular reports at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months required by the Ministry of Health for governmental hospitals and validated by hospital internal quality control mechanisms. Data extraction forms included information on numbers of hospital and CCU admission, numbers of planned beds, average lengths of hospital and CCU stay for in-patients and numbers of doctors and nurses. For the self-administered questionnaire, item generation was initially developed by 2 investigators who are Intensivists working in tertiary referral ICUs in Vietnam and the United States through literature review and group discussion among peer ICU and ID physicians during the Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Critical Care Training conducted in Vietnam in May 2015. Refinement and item reduction of the list of supplies, equipment and medicines was pragmatically generated through reviews of national guideline on management of H5N1 influenza (last updated on 2003), H1N1 influenza (last updated on 2011) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (last updated on 2015). With the consensus, the following domains were included: infection prevention and control, cardiorespiratory support and antimicrobials. The questionnaire was piloted for relevance and flow and further revised with inputs from 6 doctors working in ICUs and emergency departments in 2 provincial hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam, which were not included in the final analysis. The face validity was evaluated for the interpretation, appropriateness and logical sequence of questions using the Vietnamese questionnaire. The questionnaire content validity was also evaluated for the essentiality of the questions. The final questionnaire was distributed by mail and the information in the questionnaire was completed by the head of CCUs at selected hospitals and kept confidential.

Despite these efforts, the results of this study show that all components of personal protective equipment were not universally available. While hand hygiene materials, medical masks and sterile gloves were available at all hospitals, there were still gaps in the availability of eye protection, protective clothing and particulate respirators. Implementation of infection prevention and control measures is essential to prevent the spread of infection between patients and health care workers and when there is a lapse in consistent and correct personal protective equipment use there can be transmission [19]. During the SARS pandemic in Vietnam, cross-transmission between patients and health care workers caused five deaths [20], and similar nosocomial outbreaks were seen with MERS-coronavirus (CoV) in Saudi Arabia and South Korea [21]. The WHO recommends that when caring for all SARI patients with suspected influenza or other dangerous respiratory virus infection, that droplet precautions be used, and this indeed does seem locally feasible. But, the WHO also recommends the use of airborne precautions with particulate respirators when performing invasive procedures such as intubation [19]; and if human infection with avian influenza or MERS-CoV is suspected then the addition of contact precautions. Clearly, healthcare workers in Vietnam would not be able to fully protect themselves consistently thus placing themselves and other patients at risk. These results demand improvement of the supply chain of personal protective equipment to all hospitals in Vietnam.",

Similar findings have been reported in many developing countries, in the fight against sepsis, outbreaks, pandemics and epidemics [5], [22]. For example, at the provincial level, a patient with fluid refractory shock would be able to receive the 1st line vasopressor norepinephrine (strong recommendation from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [23]) administered through a central venous catheter. However, this was not the case at the district hospital level, where noradrenaline and central venous catheters were not widely available. Our study also shows that the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by the Berlin criteria was not feasible at either the provincial or district level hospitals because of the limited availability of blood gas analysis and mobile chest x-ray. This underscores the Lung Safe study that found that ARDS is under-recognized and under-treated globally [24] because its diagnosis in resource limited settings is much more difficult [25]. However, the Kigali-modification could be used as our study did find ultrasound to be available at both levels and near 100% availability of pulse oximetry. Vietnam could thus be an ideal setting to conduct a validation study of the Kigali-modified criteria. However, treatment of ARDS using lung protective ventilation strategy without blood gas analyzer would remain a challenge. More so at the district level, where there is limited availability of piped oxygen, ventilators and very low ventilator per bed ratios.",

With the findings of this study, there is a clear need to 1) define the essential ICU equipment and supplies needed to respond to infectious threats that present with sepsis for all hospital levels; 2) create suitable models of organization for constructing high quality, cost-effective ICUs that can respond to emerging infectious threats, including pre-hospital emergency medical services and critical care transport; 3) develop a transparent approach to modify and adapt international guidelines for local use; and 4) conduct robust evaluations of such interventions on processes of care, outcomes and costs.",

Firstly, the sampling of just 36% of hospitals makes it impossible to exactly gauge the capacity of the Vietnamese medical system, though we believe this purposive and pragmatic snapshot, is reflective of the larger picture in Vietnam, especially those with experience treating patients with SARI and with vigilance for imported case of avian influenza A virus. Secondly, the elements surveyed were also pragmatically chosen and based on national not international guidelines. This does not allow us to assess the hospital's ability to implement the full recommendations from recently published international guidelines on sepsis and other important safety interventions. Thirdly, the survey about availability of the antibiotics lacks important details and warrants further examination. Fourth, quantifying the structural and human resources are just two aspects of a country's ability to respond to infectious threats. Other aspects that need to be evaluated include the skills and knowledge of the health care workers in emergency and intensive care, and the system's current performance on processes of care and patient outcomes. More information is needed on other determinant of quality care.",
