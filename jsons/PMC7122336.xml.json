Unfortunately in this time of significant antimicrobial resistance of infectious organisms, especially bacteria, there is still a tendency for clinicians to manage a child who coughs with antibiotics. In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined \u201cpneumonia\u201d as a condition that only occurs in children who have \u201cfast breathing or chest wall indrawing\u201d [1]. That would delineate upper respiratory tract infections from those in the lower airway. However, in addition to pneumonia another important entity exists in the lower respiratory tract that is almost always viral in origin. This condition is acute viral bronchiolitis. The concept of \u201cacute lower respiratory tract infection\u201d (ALRTI) has emerged and it is becoming increasing evident from a number of studies that the infectious base of both acute pneumonia (AP) and acute bronchiolitis in children has a mixed etiology of microorganisms. Therefore, whilst certain clinical phenotypes do not require antibiotics the actual microbial etiology is much less distinct.",

ALRTI accounts for between 30 and 40% of hospital admissions, with associated case fatality rates of between 15 and 28% in developing countries but death is less common in the developed world [5, 6]. Despite the provision of effective and affordable vaccines and antibiotics that have reduced pneumonia mortality from four million in 1981 [7] to just over one million in 2013 [8], pneumonia still accounts for nearly one-fifth of childhood deaths worldwide.

In addition, the problem is compounded by the fact that many healthy children harbor both viruses and bacteria in their airways [11]. These findings suggest that the management of a LRTI in children requires choosing therapies based on clinical findings rather than on special investigations.

There may however, be important viral-bacterial co-infections [27]. Bacterial infections may complicate cases of respiratory viral infections but these children usually present with the more classic signs of AP, including alveolar consolidation on chest radiographs, raised C-reactive protein (\u226540 mg/dL), temperature \u2265 38 degrees centigrade (\u00b0C) (100.4 oF), chest crackles and bronchial breathing on chest auscultation. The role of bacterial co-infections in children with a respiratory virus-associated pneumonia is frequently under emphasized owing to limited tools for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia, with blood culture sensitivity ranging from 3 to 18% for detecting pneumococcal pneumonia [28]. However, epidemiological studies have identified a strong temporal association between some respiratory viruses and invasive pneumococcal disease. Included among these are studies on the temporal association of the influenza virus and RSV epidemics and invasive pneumococcal disease [29]. Further evidence for this association was observed in an randomized controlled trial of an investigational 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), in which children vaccinated with PCV had a 32% lower risk of being hospitalized for a viral-associated pneumonia compared with placebo recipients [30]. This lower risk of respiratory virus-associated hospitalization was evident for influenza virus, hMPV and RSV-associated pneumonia [31]. The biological rationale for the reduction in respiratory virus-associated pneumonia among the PCV-vaccinated children in this study, was attributed to vaccination having prevented the superimposed vaccine-serotype pneumococcal co-infection, which would have led to progression to more severe disease, culminating in hospitalization among the placebo recipients. Notably, there was no reduction in hospitalization for bronchiolitis among the PCV9 vaccinated children, corroborating that pneumococcal co-infection was unlikely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis.",

Certainly it seems likely that an uncontrolled or abnormal host response to viruses determines clinical outcome. It is also likely that the inflammatory cellular response influences disease severity, with for example, formation of neutrophil extra-cellular traps (NETs) in abundance in more severe disease that occlude small airways [41]. Whilst the role of vitamin D in disease association has been demonstrated for a host of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions at least one study suggest that vitamin D insufficiency is not characteristic of more severe bronchiolitis [42].",

However, additional tests to help identify a causative agent should be sought in hospitalized children as identification of a pathogen may allow for more directed therapy, provide important epidemiological data and allow for the implementation of infection control measures to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of specific pathogens (Table 2.4). However, identifying a specific etiological agent is difficult and may not be possible in most children. Diagnostic testing should not lead to delay in initiation of therapy as this may adversely affect outcome. Empirical treatment should be commenced based on the most likely pathogen and modified according to microbiological results. The following points should be considered when investigating the etiology:General tests of infection including acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)), white cell count (WBC), neutrophil count and procalcitonin will not differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonia [57\u201359]Blood culture may be useful to identify bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity, but only about 5% of blood cultures are positive in HIV-uninfected children with bacterial CAP. The sensitivity of blood cultures is greater in HIV-infected children, in whom approximately 18% of cultures are positive [28]Pleural fluid, if present, should be aspirated and sent for culture and sensitivity testingSpecimens for culture from the lower respiratory tract can be obtained using sputum induction [60], endotracheal aspiration in intubated children and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The isolation of bacteria from these samples (either on culture or using new PCR techniques) may, however, represent contamination with bacteria that normally colonize the nasopharynxTuberculin skin testing (Mantoux method) and induced sputum or gastric lavage are indicated when TB is suspected [61].\n\n",

There is now increasing evidence that the asthma phenotype expression is strongly influenced by respiratory viral infection. Whilst allergy may contribute to asthma initiation, viruses and recurrent viral infections are now understood to be equally important. The effect on asthma, however, is strongest when both factors (allergy and infection) operate in synergy [77]. New evidence suggests that susceptibility to recurrent viral infections, failure to generate protective immune tolerance to aero-allergens, and the interaction of these factors with airway inflammation may result from innate immune defects of respiratory epithelial (including mucosal dendritic) cells [77\u201380]. The resultant viral interaction with airway cells produces up-regulation of high-affinity IgE receptors on myeloid precursor cells, amplifying local airway inflammation. The genetic profile and polymorphisms of these associations are now being discovered [81]. Toll-like receptor 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (TLR1 SNPs) has been associated with both atopy and multiple viral presence in host airways [81].",

The actual antibiotic/s used depend on the local microbial epidemiology drug resistance patterns, confounding factors such as comorbid disease and availability of antibiotics in the region. In most regions of the world the common causative organisms are sensitive to amoxicillin, and hence most studies and local guidelines recommend amoxicillin as the antibiotic of choice [82\u201384]. In addition the dosing recommendation is now 40 mg/kg/dose twice daily (80 mg/kg/day) for three to 5 days [1]. Three days of therapy is recommended for AP without chest in-drawing and 5 days for AP with chest in-drawing [1]. It must be noted that the etiology of pneumonia in children differs with age. Children younger than 2 months of age are more likely to harbor a Gram-negative infection and they usually require Gram-negative cover with an aminoglycoside or a cephalosporin. It is always claimed that children older than 5 years of age are more likely to have pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and may therefore require a macrolide [85, 86]. it is also true that such infections may occur at any age and any child who does not respond to first line antibiotics or who has an atypical presentation should be considered for a macrolide [85].",

In addition, bronchodilators cause adverse events in infants and therefore, bronchodilators should not be recommended for the routine treatment of bronchiolitis. Adrenalin too, has not been documented to provide clinical benefit. A Cochrane review suggested a short-term benefit from adrenaline, especially in the first 24 hours of the illness [101], however, no differences were found for length of hospital stay. There was some evidence that adrenaline combined with steroids was effective for reducing the number of hospital admissions [101]. However, despite some benefit, most guidelines state that \u201cthere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of adrenalin for the treatment of bronchiolitis among children admitted to hospital\u201d.

Other recently published randomized trials have also added to the evidence against the use of hypertonic saline in bronchiolitis, showing no difference in length of hospital stay, clinical scores or improvement in oxygenation compared with children receiving normal saline nebulization or salbutamol [105\u2013108].

Viruses play an important role in severe infections in transplant recipients and here CMV is an important organism. Finally, viruses are now being understood to cause important acute exacerbations of chronic illnesses, including cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases.",
