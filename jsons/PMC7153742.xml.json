The report was updated in 2003 when additional factors were included: human susceptibility to infection (HIV, aging population), changing ecosystems, poverty and social inequality, war, famine, lack of political will (e.g., breakdown of public health), and the intent of harm (bioterrorism). The convergence model of the various factors shows that environmental factors interact with genetic and biological factors, social and political, as well as economic factors.

It gave analytical support that EID events rose significantly over time with a peak incidence in the 1980s concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (over 60%), originating mostly in wildlife (almost 72% of zoonoses, e.g., hantavirus infections). The authors showed that 54% of EID events were caused by bacteria or Rickettsia, including a large number of drug-resistant microbes. They proved that new EID events are significantly associated with socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors, which can provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease \u201chot spots\u201d). They showed that the risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs is high in lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. Population density is the most important driver for EID events in zoonotic wildlife and non-wildlife transmission, drug resistance, and the vector-borne transmission mode. The trends in the last decade were the following:The proportion of viral diseases compared to other infectious agents,The zoonotic wildlife transmission type,The vector-borne transmission mode, andThe non-drug-resistant pathogens increased their proportion of EID events compared to the previous decade.\n",

The risk of duodenal ulcer is increased by 4\u201325-fold in patients with Helicobacter-associated gastritis. WHO declared H. pylori as a carcinogen of first order because of its potential to enhance the risk of stomach carcinoma and MALT lymphoma in long-term infection. In high-prevalence regions for H. pylori, the frequency of stomach carcinoma is significantly higher compared to low-endemic areas (Correa et al. 1990). The identification of H. pylori facilitates curative treatment of most associated diseases in individuals. But the most important epidemiological effect on associated diseases is attributed to increased hygienic standards in industrialized countries with a substantial reduction of H. pylori prevalences in younger age cohorts.",

Molecular investigations in conserved ticks showed that ticks had been infected with Borrelia for many decades. Increased outdoor activities facilitated contacts between humans and ticks in the 1970s and the 1980s and increased transmission of Borrelia to humans at the northeastern coast of North America, leading to the discovery of Borrelia burgdorferi in 1981 by Willy Burgdorfer. Three different stages of the disease that describe the stage of infection and the involvement of different organ systems are known: stage 1, early localized infection; stage 2, early but disseminated infection; and stage 3, late stage with persistent infection.",

Seroprevalence rates that reflect about 50% of nonclinical infections vary between 2 and 18% in the general population in Germany (Hassler et al. 1992; Weiland et al. 1992). In high-risk groups like forest workers in Germany the prevalences reach 25\u201329% (Robert Koch Institute 2001a). In ticks (Ixodes) the prevalences are between 2 and 30% depending on the geographical area and the testing method used [immunofluorescence test, IFT and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]. In most studies the main risk factors of infection are age (children: 4\u20139 years, adults 35\u201360 years), outdoor activities, skin contacts with bushes and grass, and the presence of ticks in domestic animals (Robert Koch Institute 2001b). The probability of infection (seroconversion) after a tick bite in Germany is 3\u20136% and the probability of a clinical disease is 0.3\u20131.4%. The probability that the bite of an infectious tick leads to infection in the host is 20\u201330%. This depends on the time duration that the tick is feeding on the human body. Since the detection of the etiologic infectious agent and the subsequent development of laboratory diagnostic tests in the 1980s, the number of reported cases of Lyme disease has increased from 0 to 16,000 per year, indicating that it is an \u201cemerging diagnosis.\u201d The reported numbers vary depending on the reproduction of the hosting rodents for ticks as well as the contacts between humans and nature (Spach et al. 1993).",

Several studies in Europe have shown that in recent decades the tick Ixodes ricinus, transmitting Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), has spread into higher latitudes (e.g., Sweden) and altitudes (e.g., Czech Republic, Austria), and has become more abundant in many places. Such variations have been shown to be associated with recent variations in climate. As a result, new risk areas of both diseases have recently been reported from the Czech Republic. Climate change in Europe seems likely to facilitate the spread of Lyme borreliosis and TBE into higher latitudes and altitudes, and to contribute to extended and more intense transmission seasons. Currently, the most effective adaptive strategies available are TBE vaccination of risk populations and preventive information to the general public (Danielova et al. 2004; Lindgren et al. 2006; Materna et al. 2005).",

This is a typical example for emerging diagnosis due to increasing availability of routine PCR testing for these viruses in stool samples. Noroviruses (family Caliciviridae) are a group of related, single-stranded RNA viruses first described in an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a school at Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968. Five genogroups are known. Immunity seems to be strain specific and lasts only for limited periods, so individuals are likely to get the infection repeatedly throughout their life. It is estimated that noroviruses are the cause of about 50% of all food-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. For several years there has been an ongoing epidemic in several European countries due to drift variants of a new genotype (GG II.4 jamboree) previously unknown to this nonimmune population (Robert Koch Institute 2008a).",

Until 2007, smaller incidence rates of BSE cases had been reported by 21 other European countries in indigenous bovines and up to more than 43,000 per million in 2004 in Ireland. From 1999, BSE started to increase in Switzerland and Portugal, from 2004 in Spain and in recent years has spread to eastern European countries (Organisation Mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 Animale 2008). The infectious agent is a self-replicating protein, a \u201cprion.\u201d The source of infection for cows is infectious animal flour. The transmission to humans occurs through oral intake of cow products, most likely undercooked meat and nerval tissues as well as transplants of cornea, dura mater, contaminated surgical instruments, or the treatment with hypophyseal hormones extracted from animal tissues. After a statuary ban on the feeding of protein derived from ruminants to any ruminant and the export ban of all cow products from England, the epidemic of BSE in cows and the occurrence of human infections decreased in the United Kingdom since 2004. By June 2008 the total number of deaths in definite/probable cases of vCJD in the United Kingdom was 163 (The National Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit 2008).

From the 1950s, West Nile fever endemicity and epidemics started being reported from Africa and the Middle East. Severe neurological symptoms were thought to be rare. More recent epidemics in northern Africa, eastern Europe, and Russia suggested a higher prevalence of meningoencephalitis with case fatality rates of 4\u201313%. In 1999, West Nile virus was identified as the cause of an epidemic of encephalitis at the east coast of the United States (Nash et al. 1999). A seroepidemiological household-based survey showed that the first outbreak consisted of about 8,000 infections of which about 1,700 developed fever and less than 1% experienced neurological disease (Mostashari et al. 2001). Since then, epidemics occur during summer months in North America each year, with an estimated 35,000 febrile illnesses and over 1,200 encephalitis or meningitis cases in the United States in 2007 (Centers for Disease Control 2008). Age above 50 years is the main risk factor for developing severe disease. The virus is transmitted mainly by Culex mosquitoes, but also by sandflies, ceratopogonids, and ticks, with birds as reservoir hosts and incidental hosts such as cats, dogs, and horses. Efforts are made to reduce the transmitting mosquito population and to prevent mosquito bites through personal protection as well as to prevent transmission through blood donations by screening (Centers of Disease Control 2008).",

A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent (Drosten et al. 2003), being transmitted first by infected semidomesticated animals such as the palm civet and subsequently from human to human. Some cases were exported to other countries, causing smaller outbreaks there, Canada being the most affected country outside Asia with 251 cases, before control of transmission was effective. Eight thousand and ninety-six cases were reported worldwide, until July 2003, then further transmission stopped (besides one more case of laboratory transmission in 2004), indicating an efficient international cooperation in disease control (WHO 2004b).

Resistance is also a problem in parasitic diseases such as malaria (see 10.1007/978-0-387-93835-6_21), leishmaniasis, or African trypanosomiasis. Plasmodium falciparum developed resistance against all major antimalarial drugs as soon as they were used on a broad scale. Resistance had contributed significantly to the increase in malaria-associated morbidity and mortality observed in many endemic areas (Wongsichranalai et al. 2002). A recent report on failures of the new artemisinin combination treatment for P. falciparum malaria at the Thai\u2013Cambodian border supports fears of the development of resistance to this most promising class of drug at present (Dondrop et al. 2009).",

Antimicrobial resistance occurs at an alarming rate among all classes of pathogens. Even in rich countries it causes real clinical problems in managing infections that were easily treatable just a few years ago. In life-threatening infections such as sepsis, nosocomial infections, or falciparum malaria, there is a substantial risk that the initial chemotherapy might not be effective. In addition, the delay caused by inadequate treatment might favor transmission to other people and support the spread of resistant pathogens (e.g., multiresistant TB). Last but not the least, surveillance and control and the necessity to use expensive second-line drugs or combinations of antimicrobials are enormous cost factors. For developing countries this is a major limitation in the treatment and control of infections caused by resistant agents.

However, during recent years, both mortality and morbidity associated with infections are increasing again. Ironically, this is closely associated with the advances in medicine which have contributed to profound changes in the spectrum of both patients and their infections. Advanced age, underlying conditions, and an altered immune response are common features in the seriously infected hospital patient today. Immunosuppressive therapy is frequently used to treat neoplastic and inflammatory diseases or to prevent the rejection of transplants. Some infections, most notably HIV/AIDS, cause immunosuppression by itself. In the compromised patient, infections are generally more severe or may be caused by opportunistic pathogens that will not harm the immunocompetent host. Antimicrobial treatment is often less effective in these patients and tends to be further complicated by antimicrobial resistance which may manifest itself or develop at a higher frequency in the immunocompromised patient. An increasing percentage of infections are hospital acquired or otherwise health care associated. It is estimated that nosocomial infections affect 1.7 million patients and contribute to approximately 100,000 deaths in US hospitals annually (Klevens et al. 2007). Considering the rising number of elderly and immunocompromised patients, a further increase in severe infections can be predicted.",
