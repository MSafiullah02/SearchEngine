Next, unintentional misuse and passive disuse are both assumed to possess quiescent qualities. The unintentional misuse construct denotes actual behaviour where the user is misapplying the system, either consciously or unconsciously, due to a lack of skill or negligence. In contrast, passive disuse can be described as a user\u2019s passive-aggressive attitude towards having to use a system, causing the user to avoid interaction with said system. The two recalcitrant value eroding behaviour constructs describe a more sinister scenario. Active abuse encompasses situations where a user determinedly employs the system for personal gain or to perform unauthorised transactions. Finally, intentional sabotage designates the purposeful disruption or damage to a system by a disgruntled user. The outcomes of each of the actual value eroding behaviour constructs is summated into the inherent value eroded determinate which is a precursor to the mitigation gate. The latter mediates between the inherent value eroded and the residual value eroded as it attempts to moderate undesirable actioned behaviour through system controls and human influence. The final construct of residual value eroded defines the latent value eroded after measures had been taken to reduce the value erosive effects caused by system users.",

Comparing the CTVF (Fig. 1) to the proposed ATVM (Fig. 2), it is evident that participants were not in agreement as to the flow of the former, the most common view suggesting that while there appears to be a tendency for Behavioural Beliefs and Behavioural Attitudes to display a closer relationship with the quiescent behaviours, and Behavioural Intention, in turn, to display a closer relationship with the recalcitrant behaviours, ultimately, any one may function as a precursor to any one of the four value eroding behaviours. Moving on to the relationships between the four value-eroding behaviours, several participants argued against the existence of any kind of interrelationship between the constructs while others provided unique examples of instances where a specific primary behaviour could trigger a secondary behaviour.\n",

The research also supported the Intention to Use construct as it further elucidated the behavioural intent of end-users, occasioning IS abuse. The research furthermore confirmed the problem of increased organisational spent on IT with little realisation or insufficient justification on how, why and when IS investments create business value [16, 17]. In a similar vein, the research supported the literature by explicating the continued challenge that exists within organisations to measure and communicate IT value, noting that while many IT metrics measure performance, they do not measure actual value [18]. The investigation also confirmed the contributions made by several authors maintaining that the primary challenges experienced by technology driven organisations lied with the human element [e.g. 7, 8].",
