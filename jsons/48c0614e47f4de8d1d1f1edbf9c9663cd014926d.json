Of those proteins, VACV E3 is known to be ubiquitinated but distinct lysine residues have not been identified yet 1 . Also, VACV N1 has been shown to be ubiquitinated at all six possible lysine residues 2 . In our study we were able to identify two conserved ubiquitination sites in the CPXV Q1 protein at positions 70 and 78 which are identical to those in VACV N1. In total, CPXV Q1 contains five lysine residues which are homologous to VACV N1, all of which were found to be ubiquitinated in CPXV HumBer and four of which found to be ubiquitinated in HumGri, RatKre and RatHei. The remaining five CPXV proteins assigned to host-virus interaction include A44, D12, G13, J1 (VACV VH1) and CPXV N1 protein. VH1 is a viral serine/threonine protein phosphatase which is located in LBs and requires a functional proteasome for activity, presumably to release the enzyme from the LBs 3 .
