However, in addition, we have also identified 7 other SDG goals strongly related to vaccines and 6 SDG goals related to vaccine, in a total of 14 vaccine-related goals in 17 SDGs. Two of these goals are related to innovation and technological development of vaccines (SDG9 and SD17). We discuss the main vaccine development challenges for achieving SDG and current technological and regulatory obstacles particularly affecting developing countries. From this perspective, we propose STI governance strategies to overcome these gaps and increase global access to vaccines, focusing on institutional and regulatory perspectives, including intellectual property and ethics. Policy recommendations for vaccine funding and incentives for innovation, development, and production are made. Finally, we emphasize the enormous potential role that access to innovative vaccines can play on global sustainability (Milstien et al. 2007; Possas et al. 2015), benefiting particularly the poorest countries in a global context permeated by sharp social inequalities.",

Recently, in a new report, \u201cThe People\u2019s Prescription: Re-imagining Health Innovation to Deliver Public Value\u201d (Mazzucato 2018), the authors call for restructuring research and development innovation systems in order to create, rather than extract, value. It also calls for long-term \u201cmission-oriented\u201d public investment and a public return on this investment. In this report the authors argue that health innovation is about making new treatments and cures available to the people that need them. Profits might be earned but not at the cost of doing what the health system is meant to do: heal. This report is the outcome of result of collaboration between the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, STOPAIDS, and Global Justice Now and Just Treatment. The report identifies gaps of the current health innovation system and sets principles for a new model. It proposes concrete policy actions that can be taken in the long term to actively shape and co-create a health system that delivers real public value. The report is structured into two sections. The first is \u201cdiagnosis\u201d with chapters on \u201cProblems with the current health innovation system\u201d and \u201cPrinciples for a health innovation model that delivers public value.\u201d The second section, \u201cremedies,\u201d includes chapters on \u201cImmediate policy actions: Getting better prices today\u201d and \u201cTransformative proposals: Re-imagining our health innovation system to deliver public value.\u201d The report focuses on the unethical and unacceptable current global scenario for health innovation, highly inefficient, with a pharmaceutical industry that makes billions in profits without providing the affordable products that people need.",

Another example are the tests using hybrid flagelins also in malaria vaccines. Adjuvants have emerged thus as an alternative route for vaccine development with enormous potential in the global market (Mbow et al. 2010). The development of new, powerful, and safe adjuvants is therefore a key component of vaccine research. We present in Table 14.3 some of licensed vaccine adjuvants, with company and class.",
