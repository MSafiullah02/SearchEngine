Among parasites, Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. have now been recognised to be of significant involvement in the aetiology of the problem (Causap\u00e9 et al., 2002, O\u2019Handley and Olson, 2006, Geurden et al., 2008, Yang et al., 2009, Minetti et al., 2014). However, there is significantly less knowledge regarding a potential role of viruses, especially their implication as causative agents of the disease (Martella et al., 2015); rotaviruses, coronaviruses and adenoviruses could be of greater significance, although other viruses (e.g., picornaviruses, bunyaviruses) could also play a role in the problem (Lehmkuhl and Hobbs, 2008, Alkan et al., 2012, Chatzopoulos et al., 2013, Hubalek et al., 2014).",

Environmental infection into the farm barns might have led to subsequent infection of the newborns. In general, this organism is responsible for a considerable proportion of all Salmonella infections in lambs and can lead to significant losses (Davies et al., 2001, Alvseike and Skjerve, 2002). The organism has also been implicated as a cause of reproductive losses in ewes (Linklater, 2000). This is the first report of S. enterica subsp. diarizonae isolation from sheep in Greece, which indicates this pathogen as an emerging animal health problem in the country, with potential zoonotic implications (S\u00f6r\u00e9n et al., 2015).",

Several studies worldwide have reported isolation of Group A and Group B Rotavirus in lambs, with a prevalence ranging from 1% to 40% (Theil et al., 1995, Wani et al., 2004, Khafagi et al., 2010, Gazal et al., 2011), whilst in clinically healthy lambs prevalence of antibodies against Rotavirus in blood serum samples may reach up to 40% (Bridger, 2008). In other animal species, pathogenicity of rotaviruses varies, depending mainly on the viral strain and the immunological status of the host, with outbreaks caused by the virus being a frequent feature of the disease (Galindo-Cardiel et al., 2011, Alkan et al., 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of diarrhoea in lambs in Greece associated with Rotavirus. The G10 genotype is one of the most common determined VP7 types in ruminants, while P[8] is less frequently detected (Martella et al., 2010, Papp et al., 2014).",

Rotavirus-caused diarrhoea in lambs, as well as in all susceptible hosts, is the outcome of several combined factors and events, which include changes in small intestinal homeostasis, alterations in epithelial surface area and finally increased integrity, necrosis or apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (Lundgren and Svensson, 2001). Death may occur in long-term cases of irrepressible diarrhea due to extended losses of proteins and electrolytes inbalance. Possibly, Rotavirus infection might have been the cause for the increased morbidity and reduced fatality observed in the two respective flocks, in samples from which the virus was detected.",

However, prevalence of resistance was smaller among isolates from puppies than among those from lambs; there was also evidence that rate of resistance specifically to \u03b2-lactams and fluoroquinolones was significantly smaller in isolates from puppies (Carattoli, 2008, Umber and Bender, 2009, Leonard et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2013). Obviously, frequent administration of antibiotics to newborn lambs as a means to control outbreaks of diarrhoea, is the primary contributing factor to this increased prevalence. In contrast, administration of antibiotics to puppies in farms is performed infrequently if at all. Thus, one might have assumed that antibiotic resistance in isolates from puppies would have been limited.",

Rotaviruses are ubiquitous in livestock, remaining a constant health threat. Additionally, several Rotavirus strains have been shown to have the capacity to cross the species-barrier, thus infecting other animal species or humans. Unlike bovine Rotavirus strains, which have been repeatedly detected in samples from various animal species and humans, sofar there have been no similar reports regarding ovine isolates.

It is also noteworthy that, as dogs are in closer contact with humans than sheep are, this may lead to the indirect spread of ovine strains of pathogens to humans (e.g., antibiotic resistant strains).",
