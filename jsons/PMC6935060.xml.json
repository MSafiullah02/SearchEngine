To date, AstVs are divided into two genera: Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus, which contain 19 and 3 species, respectively [2]. AstVs are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses, about 28-30 nm in diameter, whose genome contain three open reading frames (ORFs), namely ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1b code for non-structural proteins, a protease and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively [3]. ORF2 codes for a highly divergent capsid protein which is formed in response to the immune pressure from the host [3]. Moreover, the genome also includes a 5\u02ca-untranslated region (UTR), a 3\u02ca-UTR and a poly-A tail.",

In particular, human astrovirues (HAstVs) have been recognized as the second most common cause of viral diarrhea in young children, the first being rotaviruses [3]. Porcine astroviruses (PAstVs) belong to the genus Mamastrovirus and were identified for the first time in 1980 by electron microscopy [4]. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the full length ORF2 capsid protein, PAstVs are divided into five genotypes (PAstV1-PAstV5) circulating in the worldwide [5\u20139]. In 2010, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classified PAstV1 as Mamastrovirus 3 [10]. However, the other four genotypes of PAstVs have not been confirmed to exist in which species of Mamastrovirus [10]. Astroviruses are detected relatively more often in diarrheic pigs as opposed to healthy ones [11, 12], but there is lack of more evidence to clarify the direct or indirect association of PAstVs with diarrhea [13]. Besides, there was more evidence of extra-intestinal infection of AstVs, it is worth noting that AstVs are detected in the central nervous system (CNS) presenting with encephalitis in various cases involving humans [14\u201316], mink [17], cattle [18\u201320], pigs [21, 22] and sheep [23]. Additionally, PAstVs were also detected in serum [24, 25] and in the respiratory and circulatory systems of animals [24, 26].",

These contain the 3\u02ca-end of the ORF1b gene, the complete capsid gene (ORF2) and the 3\u02ca-end untranslated regions (UTRs).

Sequence alignment showed that, there is a highly conserved region (UUUGGAGGGG (A/C) GGACCAAAN8/11AUGGC (N = A/T/C/G)) located at the junction of ORF1b and ORF2 (Fig. 2b), which was considered to be a subgenomic promoter for RNA transcription. An insertion of 3 nt ahead of the start codon AUG resulting at N11 was different between the four strains (i.e. CGC in PAstV2-GXBS5, ATC in PAstV2-GXNN144 and PAstV2-GXXZ5, GCC in PAstV4-GXFC36). There is no a highly conserved stem-loop-II-like motif (s2 m) in the 3\u2032-end of the genomic RNA for these four strain (Fig. 2c), which was consistent with the other PAstV2 strains and the PAstV4 strains [25, 27, 28, 32].\n",

On the other hand, there was a comparable lower prevalence in South Korea (19.4%) [7], Germany (20.8%) [36] and Sichuan province of China (17.5%) [6]. The present overall positive rate in our study reached 56.4% (300/532), and this encompassed 28 farms from nine regions/cities without a history of diarrhea. This rate is similar to the detection results seen in the Hunan province of China. Moreover, it was found that all five PAstV types were circulating in Guangxi province of China from 2013 to 2015. It was found that PAstV2 (47.7%) showed the highest prevalence, followed by PAstV1 (26.2%) and PAstV5 (21.5%), which became predominant among five PAstVs genotypes and was detected from suckling pigs to sows. This finding is similar to the results seen in Sichuan [6], which is different from the reports from Hunan [12], suggesting that the dominance type of PAstVs varies with the different geographical locations, such as PAstV4 in the USA [8] and South Korea [7] and PAstV2 in Croatia [5]. There was low prevalence of PAstV3 (5.3%) and PAstV4 (10.5%) which existed in nursery and suckling pigs, respectively. Notably, there is no report regarding PAstV3 in China, with its first detection being noted in this study. This phenomenon is similar to what had been reported previously in other nations [5, 33, 37]. The low positive rate of PAstV4 was significantly different from the Xiao\u2019s report, which displayed the higher prevalence of 62.3% in all age groups [8]. The application and efficiency of the different primers used for detection might be mainly responsible for the differences observed in the two studies. The specific primers for genotyping will be necessary to investigate the presence of different genotypes of PAstVs. In addition, the pig population selected, the density of selected farms, feeding environment, maintenance condition of fecal sample will result in the biases.",

PAstV2, PAstV4 and PAstV5 have also been found in the blood of healthy pigs [24, 25]. Moser et al. showed that infection with human astrovirus could increase the intestinal barrier permeability in a Caco-2 cell culture model system, suggesting that other astroviruses might use the same way to enter the bloodstream [39]. Our study brings new knowledge about viremia caused by PAstVs which is different from genotype reported from Croatia [24]. Six serum-derived samples belonged to PAstV1 and one sample belonged to PAstV2. It kept unknown whether PAstVs could be long-standing in sows or could have been infected from nursery pigs. More paired fecal and serum samples need be investigated to show better insights into whether there is vertical transmission, possible age-restriction and extra-intestinal pathogenesis.",

Phylogenetic analysis showed that multiple distinct genotypes of PAstVs were circulating in the pig farms, which would facilitate their genetic recombination and even probably increase the occurrence of interspecies recombination events. Luo et al. indicated that PAstV1 and PAstV3 were closely related to strains found in sheep, mink, cats and humans [33], but PAstV2 was possibly restricted to pigs. Actually, in our study, PAstV2 was closer to other animal astroviruses, such as those in porcupines, bats, cattle and deer. In particular, there was higher homology (92.8% nt identity) between porcupine astrovirus and PAstV2-XYM14, further suggesting they could share the same ancestral origin, but whether there were past cross-species transimission between porcupine and swine by yet-undentified intermediate hosts required further investigation [30].",

However, our study found the lack of s2 m in PAstV2 and PAstV4 strains, in agreement with the previous reports [25, 33, 42], so whether the lack of s2 m will affect the biological function, or whether the virus could compensate by forming stable secondary structures in the different regions of their 3\u02ca-UTR [33], remains to be confirmed by further studies.",

In particular, the results reveal the existence of all five known lineages in the pig population with a high prevalence of PAstV2, PAstV1 and PAstV5 in animals of different ages and newly described PAstV3 presence in China. Importantly, this study also proved that porcine astroviruses exist in blood with the dominance of PAstV1, adding to the reported genotypes (PAstV2, PAstV4 and PAstV5), which suggested there would be wider presence of different PAstV genotypes in blood, possibly resulting in a more complicate pathogenesis outside the enteric system. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the partial genes and molecular characterization revealed high genetic heterogeneity and more information about 3\u2032 partial genome. The strains of PAstV2 and PAstV3 were close to known astrovirus species from many different animals suggesting different ancestral origins or occurrence of interspecies transmission. More PAstVs whole genome sequences will be needed in order to fully understand the evolution and ecology of the Astroviridae family of viruses.",

Once we obtained the PAstV-positive samples, which will be double checked. The PCR cycling conditions using the two different sets of primers were as described previously [33].

The same software was used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from evolutionary distances using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method with p-distances for nucleotide sequences. The clustering stability of the NJ tree was evaluated by the bootstrap test value of 1000 replicates. Astrovirus sequences characterized in this study were deposited to GenBank under accession numbers KM211520 to KM211529, KY230626 to KY230653 and KY412128 to KY412139 and MH064173 to MH064176 for partial RNA dependent RNA polymerase, KY412101 to KY412123 for partial capsid protein sequences and KY412124 to KY412127 for the complete capsid protein sequences.",
