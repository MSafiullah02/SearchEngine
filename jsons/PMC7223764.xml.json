            "text": "Biomolecules play an important role in any ligand-target interaction and their recognition in any biological system starts the cascade of signalling steps, which is an important part of the normal body function. Nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids are the important ligands that bind and cause conformational changes in targets (receptors) but the messengers that release after binding and conformation changes are peptides. Any defect in these signal transduction processes cause diseases (Otvos and Wade 2014; Gautam 1999). Proteins, under the influence of proteolytic enzymes get fragmented at particular catalytic sites to form bioactive peptides. Bioactive peptides are made up of 2\u201320 amino acids and lack protein\u2013protein interaction because of their small size. They have properties like tissue affinity, specificity, and efficiency (Moller et al. 2008). The structure and the overall charge and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the any bioactive peptide depends on the nature of amino acids, their sequences in the peptide backbone along with the N and C terminals. The relation between structure and biological activity of the bioactive peptides are yet not confirmed but the structure is an important arbitrator for their activity (Li and Yu 2015). Bioactive and nutraceutical peptides have a positive effect in the regulation of the health of an individual (Kitts and Weiler 2003). They boost the quality of human health by preventing various ailments and by improving medical conditions related to lifestyle, metabolism, and immunity (Vitetta et al. 2005).",

Peptide drugs are effective and specific to their biological target but devoided of some of the essential qualities of a drug to withstand in the current market of therapeutics. Proteins have a large chemical structure which makes their synthesis complex, tedious and expensive, the further low oral bioavailability of proteins limit their oral delivery hence they are administered through parenteral route (Uhlig et al. 2014). The worldwide peptide therapeutics market size valued at USD 22,071.5 million in 2017 and assumes to grow at CAGR of 9.1% over the period 2018 to 2026. (2016). Insulin is the first therapeutic peptide which has been used widely and shares good peptide market. It was first isolated by Frederick Banting and Charles Best from pancreatic islet extracts, further, J.B. Collip developed the method for extraction and purification of insulin from other animal sources (Quianzon and Cheikh 2012). Eli Lilly began producing insulin from the animal pancreas, later on, biosynthetic insulin was introduced in 1983 with the name Humulin. Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Eli Lilly together share 88.7 percent of the global insulin market. Lantus (basal insulin) is a product of Sanofi accounts for approximately 22.29% of the total sales of top 10 antidiabetic drug brands, in 2016 sale of Lantus was USD 6.057 billion (Dezzani 2017). Small molecules and peptide-based drug candidate belongs to the category of New Chemical Entities (NCEs) according to the Food and Drug Administration, on the other hand, proteins used for the treatment of various diseases are classified under New Biological Entities (NBEs).",

            "text": "Plentiful bioactive peptides have been reported from the animal and plant sources. Most of the peptides that had bioactivity are being derived from animal products such as milk, eggs, meat, and fish. Plant peptides are still under exploration and few bioactive peptides are reported from soy, wheat, etc (Hartmann and Meisel 2007). In animals, proteins are associated with high-fat content and lead to diseases, including high blood pressure and heart diseases if consumed in the large amount. On the other hand, plant proteins neither have associated fat nor have any side effects (Nehete et al. 2013). Previously, plant hormones were considered the only player through which cells communicate, but from the last decade as research was driven towards an understanding of plants signaling, secreted peptides, small RNAs and transcription factors emerging as a new and well-defined player in the cell to the cell communication network (Lindsey et al. 2002; Van Norman et al. 2011; Murphy et al. 2012). However, it is now clearly defined that signaling peptides of plant and animal origin are biosynthesized through the pathway that is evidently similar, although some aspects of the biosynthesis are still not identified. Peptides secreted by plants have well recognized role in preliminary processes of development like the growth of meristem, organ shedding, cell elongation, cell multiplication, cell differentiation, geotropism and protection from the invader (Ghorbani 2014). The ubiquitous presences of proteins, peptides as mediator components convey to the proposals that these messenger peptides may have emerged evolutionary in microbes and were further integrated into the complicated mediator systems of complex organisms during evolution (Roth et al. 1982). Existence of hormone-like peptides in plants including insulin-like peptide in Spinacia oleracea L. (Spinach) and Lemna gibba G-3, prolactin-like inhibitor in alfalfa, a substance with luteinizing hormone-releasing activity from leaves of Avena sativa L. (Oat) and somatostatin-like material in spinach support this assumption, it is speculated that the signaling peptides in plants existed from about 1 billion years ago (Collier et al. 1987; Fukushima et al. 1976; Leroith et al. 1985; Morley et al. 1980). Plant proteins containing essential amino acids are important in the food chain to fulfill human physiological needs. The proteins from plants are derived from leaves, seeds, and fruits, out of which seeds are considered as an economical source of proteins. As compared to vegetables and fruits, seeds (legumes and cereals) contain a higher amount of protein (Creighton 1993). Proteins in a mature seed represent 18\u201320% in Pisum sativum L. (Pea), Vicia faba L. (Faba) bean and till 35\u201345% in Lupinus albus L. (Lupin) and Glycine max L. (Soybean) (Gueguen and Cerletti 1994).",

Inhibitors of this enzyme decrease the glucose toxicity (improves insulin sensitivity), decreases stress on beta cells (decreases post-meal hyperglycemia), increases glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production hence increases insulin secretion (Scheen 2003; Mooradian and Thurman 1999). In general, normalization of postprandial hyperglycemia is difficult as compared to fasting hyperglycemia, inhibitors act specifically on the postprandial part of 24 h blood glucose curve and causes a reduction in diabetes-associated hyperglycemia which is responsible for macrovascular complication in patients (Mooradian and Thurman 1999; Ceriello et al. 2004). Glycaemic control is achieved with these agents reduces glucotoxicity which increases insulin secretion from the beta cell (Scheen 2003; Salvatore and Giugliano 1996).",

They stimulate insulin secretion, decrease glucagon, inhibit gastric emptying, reduce food intake and appetite (Drucker and Nauck 2006). In diabetic individuals, reduced secretion of incretin hormones have been observed. These gut hormones bind with their respective receptors and show their biological action (Barnett 2006). Treatment of diabetes requires to restore either normal secretion or reduce the degradation of these hormones. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a protease enzyme that cleave the GLP-1 hormone within minutes after its secretion and makes it inactive for biological function. Thus, inhibition of DPP-IV has the potential to revert the hyperglycaemic condition. DPP-IV inhibitors block the rapid degradation of GLP-1 and enhance the postprandial level of active GLP-1 which further reduces the liver glucagon production and stimulate beta cells of the pancreas and increase insulin level (Ahr\u00e9n 2007).",

Vigna unguiculate L. (Cowpea) containing bio-molecules have contributed in reducing the blood glucose level and enhancing the antioxidant status of patients. Study on L6 rat skeletal muscle cells was performed where cells were treated with cowpea peptides at different doses (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 ng) for 20 h or insulin (100 nM) for 30 min. Further, from the treated cells proteins were isolated for western blot analysis to check the phosphorylation of Akt (a form of protein kinase B; PKB). The results of the study showed that the cowpea peptides have the ability to phosphorylated Akt in the cell culture. This observation suggests that the treatment of cowpea peptides to the skeletal muscle cells can initiate the insulin signaling cascade. There is a possibility that cowpea peptides have the ability to mimic like insulin by inducing the same signaling cascade (Uruakp, 2015).",

Study on protein from the pulp of M. charantia L. showed increase glucose uptake in C2C12 myocytes and 3T3L adipocyte, the in vivo studies showed that the protein obtained from pulp helps in secretion of the insulin as well as act like insulin to lower the glucose level (Yibchok-Anun et al. 2006). Polypeptide-P was isolated from the M. charantia L. acts like insulin mimetic (Khanna et al. 1981). Another 68-residue insulin receptor (IR)-binding protein (mcIRBP) was reported from the plant upon in vitro digestion yields mcIRBP-19, spanning residues 50\u201368 of mcIRBP which increases the binding of insulin to its receptor, stimulate the phosphorylation of PDK1 and Akt, induces the expression of glucose transporter 4, and stimulate both the uptake of glucose in cells and the clearance of glucose in diabetic mice (Lo et al. 2016). A novel protein called MCy having molecular weight 17kD was isolated from Momordica cymbalaria L. fruit which showed hypoglycemic effect in in vivo study (Rajasekhar et al. 2010). The peptide fraction obtained from the soybean showed increase in glucose uptake in muscular cells, it is reported that obtained peptide fraction enhances the glucose uptake via AMK activation (Roblet et al. 2014).",

Peptide reported from the leaves of Bauhinia variegata L, mimics like insulin which is evidently proved from the immunological reactivity and via in vivo study (Azevedo et al. 2006). Zea mays L. (Zein) seed protein hydrolysate increase the secretion of GLP-1 directly in the ileum and indirectly in the duodenum in the rat and also confirmed with the help of GLUTag cell line study (Hira et al. 2009). Aglycine which is a bioactive peptide obtained from the soy bean increases the glucose uptake in C2C12 cell, whereas in in vivo study on diabetic model it was observed that treatment with aglycine increases the expression of p-IR, p-IRS1, p-Akt and membrane GLUT4 protein which results into hypoglycemia (Lu et al. 2012). Soymorphin-5 also called \u00b5-opioid obtained from soy bean decreases the blood glucose level via activation of adiponectin and PPAR\u03b1 systems in diabetic KKAy mice (Yamada et al. 2011). Rice bran protein hydrolysate helps to improve insulin resistance and prevent metabolic diseases (Boonloh et al. 2015). Protein extracted from the fruit pulp of Momordica dioica Roxb. decreases the blood glucose level in a diabetic model (Poovitha et al. 2017). Plant scientist believe that there are more plants left unexplored which may contain insulin-like peptides or peptides which will mimic insulin (Xavier-Filho et al. 2003).",

The oral route of drug administration remains the most accepted route of drug delivery and most of the available drugs in the market are delivered through the oral route (Morishita and Peppas 2006). An orally active drug should be stable enough to withstand the gastric microenvironment and also it should be permeable through the gastrointestinal membrane. Small molecules are well tolerant to the gastric pH and permeated through the membrane whereas the large macromolecules are vulnerable to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and are not permeable in their intact form to reach specific target successfully without being degraded in GIT (Morishita and Peppas 2006). As the medical field advances, the peptide drugs are widely explored for their therapeutic potential in the treatment of various diseases. Though these drugs are specific to their target, efficacious and potent, the oral bioavailability of peptide and peptide-based drugs always remains a challenge that limits their wide acceptance and market value. High cost of therapy is a major limitation associated with peptide drugs (Ayoub and Scheidegger 2006). With the advancement of biotechnology, the recombinant synthesis of a peptide of interest opens a door for cheap and cost-effective peptides. Also, the commercial interest for the production of bioactive peptides from the natural sources is elevated to reduce the cost but due to the lack of suitable technologies which helps to retain or increase the activity of bioactive peptides, the large-scale production gets hampered (Craik et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Another limitation associated with peptide-based drugs is their short half-life. When the peptides come in contact with intestinal mucosa, gastric acid in stomach and peptidases that are present in the blood convert peptides into amino acids and gets quickly eliminated from the body, thereby reducing its half-life. In order to achieve prolonged action and to reduce the frequent dosing, it is necessary to increase the half-life of the peptides. As peptide therapeutics advances, several non-degradable polymers and polymeric matrix are available to increase the half-life of peptides and proteins thus reducing the frequent dosing (Brown 2005). Another strategy to increase the half-life of the peptide is to modify the amino acids which are susceptible to cleavage by enzymes (Adessi and Soto 2002). Oral delivery of the peptides is explored in past years but limits its use as peptides are degraded in the GIT tract (Lau et al. 2015). Novo Nordisk developed a semaglutide oral formulation which is currently in clinical trial phase 3. Other non-invasive and suitable routes for the peptide and protein-based drugs are under investigation includes the nasal and pulmonary route which directly deliver the drugs to the blood component hence, reduces the overall drug degradation which is the main drawback associated with oral delivery of peptides (Davies et al. 2017).",

Traditional synthesis and drug design approaches are used by researchers and pharmaceutical companies for the development of the peptide-based drug candidate. The recombinant protein is another tool for the synthesis of the desired peptide in bacteria, yeast, and fungi. The market of peptides has now moved from the isolation of peptides from an animal source that can mimic the endogenous peptide to synthetic, semi-synthetic and recombinant peptides. Further, development in this area is drug conjugated peptides and multifunctional peptides (Fosgerau and Hoffmann 2015). Peptides are susceptible to degradation when given orally, which is supposed to be the most convenient route of administration. The preferred route for the peptide delivery is intravenous, however, more research is directed for the delivery of peptides. Recently, alternative routes are explored, which include oral, transdermal and intranasal route. As peptides are excellent biomarkers, they can also be utilized for diagnosing diseases. Further, peptides are also found to be advantageous in vaccine development (Brown 2005; Sheridan 2012).",

Amino acid sequencing in mass spectrometry can be performed by two methods namely top-down sequencing and down-top sequencing. In top\u2013down sequencing, the proteins analysis is performed without hydrolysis and the molecular weight can be detected by fragmentation pattern of the whole protein. A common approach is down-top sequencing in which proteolytic digestion is performed followed by MS analysis.

            "text": "Apparently, most of the bioactive peptides available for the treatment of diabetes have emerged from the synthetic route or derived from recombinant technology, which further adds in the overall cost of the treatment. To make peptide therapy economic there is a demand to explore plant-based biomolecules. This review discusses bioactive peptide isolated from various plant parts like leaves, fruits and seeds. The trend indicates that most of the bioactive peptides are obtained from seeds, although reports are available where bioactive peptides have been also isolated from leaves, whole fruits and pulps. It was observed in various in vitro and in vivo studies that protein hydrolysate obtained from aqueous extracts of plant are capable of inhibiting the enzymes and transporter systems responsible for the diabetes. Expedition to find molecular targets and mechanism of action of plant based bioactive peptides is needed to use these bioactive peptides as a potential drug candidate.",

            "text": "Epidemiological data reveals that type 2 diabetes requires promising therapy as the available synthetic drugs for the treatment have moderate to severe adverse effects. Plant-derived bioactive peptides inhibit the enzymes like alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV and glucose transporter systems involved in type 2 diabetes. In vivo studies of a certain plant peptides fraction showed insulin-mimetic action in animal models. It is clear that plant-derived bioactive peptides are not explored to their full potential in comparison to other classes of natural products. The reason might be the lack of suitable instrumental techniques to identify, purify and characterize the peptides from plant source. However, the recent advancement in LCMS, LC-NMR, and X-ray crystallography has bridged the gap and this would be the right time to embark on plant peptides. In future, systematic studies including dereplication for the early identification of known peptides, target identification followed by in vivo studies would help to speed up the plant peptides research.",
