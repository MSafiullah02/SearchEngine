Because the application rates during the simulations were 8.4 cm h \u22121 , these run-off values should represent a near-worst-case scenario. Linear regressions were used because quadratic equations did not improve the correlation coeffi cients. Amounts of daily precipitation throughout the entire grazing season of both years were entered into the regression equation at the nearest date to calculate predicted runoff from each site class from a 0.5-m 2 area of land.

Streams in both CSU pastures and in one RS pasture had ox bows opposite from cut-banks, whereas CSR pastures had no ox bows (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the mean bank stability score of CSU pastures was 12 and 30% greater than CSR and RS pastures when the treatments were initiated in May 2005 (Nellesen et al., 2011) , implying that the banks in the CSU pastures were more unstable than banks in the CSR and RS pastures at the initiation of treatments within these pastures. From May 2005 to September 2009, bank stability scores increased by 1.68, 1.66, and 4.03% yr \u22121 in CSU, CSR, and RS pastures, respectively, implying that stream bank stability in RS pastures was declining more rapidly than CSU or CSR pastures (Nellesen et al., 2011; Schwarte et al., 2010) . However, trend analysis of the monthly erosion/ deposition data from 2005 through 2007 showed that RS pastures had an increasing trend (i.e., a decrease in bank erosion), whereas no trend was observed in CSU and CSR pastures (Nellesen et al., 2011) . Although studies have shown signifi cant reductions in stream bank erosion resulting from cattle exclusion (Kauff man et al., 1983; Trimble, 1994; Zaimes et al., 2008) , other studies have not (Allen-Diaz et al., 1998; George et al., 2002; Nellesen et al., 2011) .

However, sediment and P loading via fecal deposition and surface runoff together accounted for 0.5 and 5.6% of average sediment and P losses, respectively. A greater percentage of P loading than sediment loading was attributed to runoff and direct deposition because of the high concentration of P in the cattle feces. Additionally, if P is fed in concentrations higher than necessary, the total P concentration and the proportion of water-soluble P in fecal excretion increases (Dou et al., 2002) . Because the forage P concentrations at the farm were adequate to meet the cattle's nutritional requirements (?2.0 g kg \u22121 dry matter) (Haan et al., 2007) and the mineral supplement used in this study was void of P, it is likely that the P excretion values observed in this study were lower than the values would have been if a P supplement had been off ered. Th erefore, direct deposition of cattle feces into a pasture stream may add a signifi cant amount of P to the water if cattle are spending a large amount of time within the stream. However, in the current study, cattle in the CSU treatment spent 1.8% of their time in the stream, whereas cattle in the CSR and RS treatments spent 0.35 and 0.09% of their time in the stream, respectively (Schwarte et al., 2010) .
