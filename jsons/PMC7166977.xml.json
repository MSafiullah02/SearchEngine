Especially in young children (<1 year old) and elderly people (>65 years old) complications may occur, even though influenza\u2010like illness is most often self\u2010limited and restrained to the upper respiratory tract [Hall, 1987; Flamaing et al., 2003; Cilla et al., 2008].",

Other symptoms including myalgia, headache, chills and fatigue can only be used as optional inclusion criteria. In influenza\u2010like illness cases in children, influenza virus has been the most commonly detected virus, followed by other respiratory viruses such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [Zambon et al., 2001; Talavera and Mezquita, 2007]. Symptoms caused by these viruses are similar, making it difficult for clinicians to associate clinical features of influenza\u2010like illness with the presence of a specific virus. In addition, viral identification could be very useful in terms of patient management, in the prevention of unjustified use of specific antiviral drugs and/or antibiotics, as well as in the implementation of appropriate public health measures, which may contain the spread of highly contagious viruses within a hospital setting. The introduction of molecular methods has revealed that a wide spectrum of well characterized respiratory viruses such as human rhinovirus (HRV), human parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3 (HPIV 1, 2, and 3) and human adenovirus (HAdV) as well as recently identified viruses, such as human bocavirus (HBoV) and human coronavirus (HCoV) can contribute to influenza\u2010like illness [Furuse et al., 2010].",

This study focused on screening for a wider panel of respiratory viruses contributing to influenza\u2010like illness with the analysis of more than 1,200 specimens over a 3\u2010year prospective study, thus revealing their incidence in children with influenza\u2010like illness.

To determine the limit of detection (LOD), an indication of the analytical sensitivity of the PCR during the optimization process, plasmids expressing the gene target of interest were constructed using the TOPO\u2010TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [Kuypers et al., 2004].

Furthermore, additional associations have been observed: 31% of patients who were infected with HAdV suffered from diarrhea and/or emesis and/or abdominal pain (RR: 3.312, 95%CI: 2.238\u20134.901), in 20% of the HBoV positive cases, patients presented with diarrhea (RR: 1.856, 95%CI: 1.112\u20133.096), 31.6% of HCoV positive patients suffered from emesis (RR: 2.473, 95%CI: 1.179\u20135.189) and 27.7% of HRV positive patients felt abdominal pain (RR: 1.584, 95%CI: 1.162\u20132.159). No difference in the severity of symptoms was observed between mixed and single infections.",

HRV was the second more frequently detected virus (19.7%), highlighting it as an important contributor to influenza\u2010like illness, an observation also made by others [Kelly and Birch, 2004; Druce et al., 2005], although this virus has been usually incriminated in common cold cases in the absence of high fever [Bellei et al., 2008]. HRSV presented similar detection rates to HRV, with subtypes A and B alternating from year to year [Deng et al., 2006]. Its circulation was simultaneous with influenza virus, a phenomenon reported before [Canducci et al., 2008; Fabbiani et al., 2009]. The proportion of positive HAdV samples in Greek pediatric influenza\u2010like illness cases was slightly higher than other studies showed [Echavarria et al., 2006]. HBoV was the fifth most frequently detected virus accounting for 10% of the laboratory\u2010confirmed infections, in line with previous reports [Manning et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007]. HMPV cases (5.4%) were concordant with previous reports from Northern Greece [Gioula et al., 2010], while detection of types 229E and OC43 of HCoV, rarely associated with severe respiratory infections in children, amounted to approximately 4.0% of positive cases. A higher prevalence of HCoVs has been reported in infants with acute respiratory disease [Canducci et al., 2008], however NL63 and HKU1 HCoVs subtypes were also included in that study.",

HRV predominant circulation, before and after the influenza virus peak, has been associated with children returning to school and with weather conditions favoring HRV expansion [Monto, 2002, 2004], while its high prevalence might have moderated or prevented other viruses from establishing themselves [Greer et al., 2009]. On the other hand, it is expected that physicians screening for influenza\u2010like illness would be more likely to swab influenza positive patients during its peak season. HBoV prevalence during the early winter and late spring has been described before [Arnold et al., 2006; Calvo et al., 2010], however a recent review has indicated that there is no obvious regular seasonal occurrence of the virus [Allander, 2008].",

Influenza virus predominated in children older than 5 years while HRSV, HMPV and HBoV prevailed in preschool children, an observation also made by others [Manning et al., 2006; Fabbiani et al., 2009]. There is a complexity in factors that could explain the observed age patterns and may relate to the host, the socio\u2010economical environment, as well as viral genetic variation. Infant immune system immaturity and/or presence of maternal antibodies were identified as major host determinants [Crowe and Williams, 2003]. Presence of siblings, poor living conditions and crowding in schools, are all factors which facilitate the spread of respiratory viruses [Groothuis et al., 2011]. Moreover, viral genetic variation may contribute to the escape of antigenically distinct variants from previously acquired immunity or protective vaccination [Carrat and Flahault, 2007; Kirchberger et al., 2007].",

However, it is difficult to clearly determine the contribution of HRV to infection, due to the fact that the virus is also detected in asymptomatic control patients [Peltola et al., 2008; Fry et al., 2011]. No potential relative contribution of HRV in mixed infections, with regards to the severity of referral symptoms, was observed, although a similar analysis with regards to the severity of disease progression was not feasible, due to lack of clinical information. Casalegno et al. [2010] studying co\u2010circulation of HRV and pandemic A(H1N1) influenza virus indicated that HRV epidemics may interfere with the spread of the pandemic strain. Similar analysis in this study did not reach statistical significance, although patterns of HRV and seasonal influenza virus were analogous to those reported by Linde et al. [2009] for HRV and the pandemic strain. Undoubtedly, there can be no direct comparison between these studies, because the pattern of spread of pandemic and of seasonal influenza strains was different.",

Interestingly, 20% of the infected HBoV patients presented diarrhea, suggesting that HBoV\u2010related disease may extend beyond the respiratory to the gastrointestinal tract, defining it also, as a possible enteric pathogen [Kahn, 2007; Neske et al., 2007; Pozo et al., 2007]. Moreover, as emesis was present in one third of influenza\u2010like illness HCoV\u2010positive patients, it might be a useful potential indicator of HCoV infection in children. It is also worth mentioning that HAdV disease came along with significantly high proportion of emesis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which may reveal the existence of HAdV species affecting the enteric tract, although these types in respiratory specimens have rarely been published [Echavarria et al., 2006]. Finally, although mixed viral infections have been associated with more severe cases of respiratory infections in infants [Richard et al., 2008; Semple et al., 2005], our study was not designed to reveal such differences in disease severity, if any.",
