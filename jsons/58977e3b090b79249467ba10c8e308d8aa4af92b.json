In this article, we reflect on how insights from the literature on career shocks can help us understand the career consequences of the pandemic and offer suggestions for future research in this area. In particular, we offer three \"key lessons\"\". The first lesson is that the implications of Covid-19 reflect the dynamic interplay between individual and contextual factors. Here, we argue that although the pandemic was difficult to predict and control, research shows that certain psychological resourcessuch as career competencies and resiliencecould make this career shock more manageable. The second lesson is that the pandemic may have differential implications over time, as suggested by research that has shown the consequences of career shocks to differ between short-term vs. long-term time horizons, and across life-and career stages. The third lesson is that, even though the pandemic is clearly a negatively valenced shock for most people, further into the future it may allow for more positive outcomes. This lesson builds on research showing how negative career shocks have long-term positive consequences for some people. We hope that these insights will inspire both scholars and practitioners to study and understand the work and career implications of Covid-19 as a career shock, as well as to support people in dealing with its consequences.",

While national governments are currently preoccupied with managing short-term implications such as lockdown policy and planning, longer term economic and societal implications are likely to be severe. As a corollary, it will also have direct impact on both short-and long-term individual career experiences, opportunities and trajectories. For example, healthcare and other frontline workers are working around the clock to provide relevant and dedicated support services, whereas other workers have been forced to work from home, requiring adaptation to on-line and virtual work arrangements. Others are facing immediate or imminent job loss as organizations cut back on service provisions and customer demand decreases. Employers are also facing significant challenges, including small business owners struggling to keep up with overhead costs. Unemployment rates have drastically increased since the start of the pandemic. Globally, initial estimates from the International Labor Organization (ILO) (2020)",

These figures clearly indicate that Covid-19 will have a profound impact on people\"s careers and, as a consequence, is a major career shock for many people.

In this regard it comprises two key elements: (1) an event, and (2) a process of initial sensemaking, which means that a disruptive and extraordinary event is not necessarily a career shock in itself. For example, unexpectedly losing a mentor or valued coworker can be interpreted as a major shock by one person, whereas another may continue with \"business as usual\". Indeed, Akkermans et al. (2018) argue that career shocks can have different attributes, which potentially determine their impact on people\"s careers, such as frequency, controllability, intensity, valence, and duration. For example, a single career shock may be low in intensity (e.g., a colleague leaves the organization), meaning it might not cause significant deliberate thought processing at first. However, if it happens multiple times (e.g., a number of colleagues leave), that is when frequency is high, the cumulative effect could be profound.",

Though not explicitly framed in terms of career shocks, Baruch et al.

Furthermore, Baruch and Lavi-Steiner (2015) showed that career events moderated the effect of a protean career orientation on career outcomes, and Hirschi and Valero (2017) showed that there are dynamic patterns in how people\"s career decidedness relates to the impact of career events.",

And, two negative career shockshaving a mentor depart the organization and a significant organizational changedid not impact the employee\"s immediate intentions to attend graduate school, however, did impact the likelihood that the employee subsequently applied to graduate school 16 months later.

First, studies should be designed to capture both short-term and long-term consequences. Although research is likely to find that this specific career shock has mostly negative career and psychological consequences in the short-term (e.g., job loss, reduced salary, lower career and work satisfaction), over time some individuals (see lesson #1) may move into more satisfying careers or job roles through their own proactive career behaviors. Indeed, research has demonstrated that employees who experience a novel and critical negative workplace event were more likely to engage in improvisation behaviors such as taking advantage of opportunities and \"thinking outside the box\" (Chen et al., in press) . Conversely, other individuals may be in occupations that have been able to adapt to the pandemic requirements of social and physical distancing (e.g., education, journalism, and government), thus, the effects of the pandemic shock on respective career outcomes may be neutral or even positive in the short term.

At the same time, very early career adults may be less likely to currently have children or a mortgage loan, giving them one less \"worry\" during the pandemic. Mid-career individuals may be more established in their careers, but for those who did lose their jobs, finding a new job may take more time. Mid-life also means one is more likely to have the added stress of work-family conflict and financial debt (Ragins et al., 2014) . For later-career adults and retirees, the pandemic may be especially stressful given the higher rates of death among the elderly and economic implications for pensions and investments. Some may take this opportunity to start retirement planning, others, especially in non-profit and health care sectors, are coming out of retirement to help their former colleagues cope with the high demand of their services. Resource-based theories, such as Job Demands-Resources theory (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017) and Conservation of Resources theory (Hobfoll et al., 2018) , and work-life spillover theories (Edwards & Rothbard, 2000) provide useful lenses to help identify how and why various work and family experiences associated with the pandemic crisis impact individual\"s career, work, and psychological outcomes across various life and career stages.",

Similarly, Rummel et al. (2019) showed that for some young entrepreneurs, being forced to leave a corporate career was initially a negative experience but ultimately led them into becoming a successful entrepreneur. Similarly, other workers whose organizations have moved to provide much-needed medical supplies are also developing new skill sets and finding new meaning in their work. The \"silver lining\" of these trends may, therefore, be that some individuals who may have otherwise been reluctant to engage in proactive skill development and career behaviors have augmented both their short-and long-term career sustainability by effectively dealing with the current changes in work demands (De Vos et al., 2020) .",

Specifically, we argued that the impact will be the consequence of a dynamic interplay between contextual and individual factors, which will differ for people across career and life stages. Also, we argued that there may be differences between short-term and long-term consequences, for example that even though the pandemic is a negative career shock, it may have longer term positive implications for some. We hope that these insights will inspire scholars and practitioners alike to study and understand the work and career implications of Covid-19 as a career shock, as well as to support people in dealing with this shock.",

(2019)  show that individuals who develop reflective, communicative, and behavioral career competencies are better able to capitalize on positive career shocks, such as unexpected promotions. Indeed, career competencies can help people to become more employable and engaged, and also more resilient in the face of setbacks(Akkermans et al., 2015). Similarly,Seibert et al. (2016) presented a broad range of psychological and behavioral strategies that individuals can use to become resilient when facing shocks. Psychological strategies include dealing with distracting emotions and nurturing a growth mindset, and examples of behavioral strategies are developing social relationships and participating in training activities. In all, the literature on career shocks shows that career resources and behaviors are important factors that can influence how well people cope with negative career shocks and capitalize on positive ones.Our advice to scholars studying the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic is to take into account the dynamic interplay between contextual and individual factors as critical J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f determinants of how this particular career shock may have differential implications for different people. Prior empirical findings may help focus future studies in the selection of concepts to examine, and particularly Event Systems Theory and Bourdieu\"s Theory of Practice may be helpful frameworks for understanding the interplay between contextual and individual elements (though others may also be helpful, seeAkkermans et al., 2018 for a brief overview).",
