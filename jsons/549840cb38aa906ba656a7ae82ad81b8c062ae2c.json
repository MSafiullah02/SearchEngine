A new common household word, COVID-19 has come bringing lessons we did not even know we needed. There is still much to be learned regarding the pathogenesis of this virus, the pathway it has chosen in our communities, the widely variable course of illness, the best practices for treating the afflicted, and the potential for prevention by transmission barriers as well as pharmacotherapeutic vaccines. As overwhelming as the lack of knowledge may feel, the fear and lack of preparation of the world and our country has brought is even more overwhelming.",

Many of these plans include the activation of an incident command center which will serve as the focal point for allocation of staff and resources when needed. According to the World Health Organization, this command center often includes relevant representation from services within the organization that will have an impact on services. 2 These include but are not limited to executive leadership, marketing and communications, security, patient care services, human resources, pharmacy, and infection control.",

Notably, well-established entities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/) and the World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/) are highly reputable resources for current information and frequent clinical updates for any endemic or pandemic event. An example frequently discussed on social media is the use of homemade face masks. At one time discouraged, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now offers that there are situations where homemade masks might be used as a last resort. 4 The Joint Commission also echoes this warning regarding homemade facemasks and recommend they be used only as an extreme measure. 5 In terms of the provision of care, two major actions have impacted perianesthesia nurses. One is the transformation of the traditional Phase I postanesthesia care unit (PACU) into a surge overflow unit. This extension of the critical care service line into the perianesthesia environment has generally not been in the workflow plans for the Phase I PACU. Space and equipment have become enormous challenges. More challenging however, is the deployment of perianesthesia nursing staff into areas of unfamiliar patient care. Great perianesthesia nurses do not necessarily have solid critical care skills or familiarity with the daily routine of general medical-surgical floor care. Acknowledging the discomfort associated with working in unfamiliar environments or with unfamiliar standards of care is the first step to begin educational opportunities as contingency plans for rapid training. Nurses must continue to provide the best possible care with the best possible resources. At times, during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses must not lose focus on safety. 3 CARING FOR THE CAREGIVERS During prolonged experiences of high stress and working with constant change, threats to the survival of patients and the health of the caregiver, as well as the unprecedented state of the unknown, staff are at high risk for stress and stress responses. What resources does your institution have for employee assistance? Can opportunities for added rest periods and breaks be incorporated into staffing models during temporary surges? How is communication regarding the progress of the work surrounding the crisis being disseminated? Is there enough communication? Is the communication clear? Is the incident command center capable of receiving communication back from the staff? What other measures can the institution put into place to support the frontline workers? In this current pandemic, measures to screen patients and visitors, restrict visitors, and other recommendations such as social distancing are aimed at reducing and ultimately stopping the spread of the illness. Conducting frequent reviews of donning and doffing as well as providing an observer to monitor compliance with proper utilization of the personal protective equipment are additional means of protecting workers.
