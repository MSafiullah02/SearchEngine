While the optimal configuration of a trauma resuscitation area is debatable, the space needs to be large enough to accommodate the trauma team and ancillary staff. It also needs to have ready access to supplies and equipment to quickly and easily control hemorrhage, secure an airway and initiate fluid resuscitation. Lastly, stores of personal protective equipment in the form of fluid resistant gowns, head covering, face shield, and gloves (both sterile and nonsterile) should be readily available but under strict access. As CoV2 carriers increased in our population in New Jersey, we treated each incoming trauma patient as a potentially CoV2-positive case and sought to reconfigure out trauma resuscitation area to minimize exposure of our supplies to aerosolized virus.",

With the surge of CoV2-positive patients into our trauma catchment area, we have noted a substantial number of asymptomatic trauma patients that mandated that all trauma patients be considered potentially positive. Trauma resuscitation bays must accommodate three key components: staff, supplies needed for immediate control of hemorrhage and resuscitation, and personal protective equipment (PPE). 1 2 Unfortunately, supplies and equipment kept out and readily available, results in them being contamination by aerosolized virus. With this in mind, we reconfigured our trauma resuscitation area with the following goals in mind: (1) maintaining protection of staff without excessive use of PPE, (2) maintaining easy accessibility of supplies and equipment without contaminating stores and (3) limiting traffic in and out of the 'hot zone' of potential CoV2 exposure. The following describes our approach to the trauma patient during the covid-19 pandemic.",

The ACS COT considers these to be minimum precautions and protection for all healthcare providers'. With PPE in short supply, there is also a necessity to shepherd this resource and having everyone gown up is simply not possible.

The routine equipment carts were moved well away from the trauma bay. The trauma bay and resuscitation area were divided into hot, warm and cold zones (figure 3) in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Hazmat practices. 3 The hot zone was the area directly around the patient. The limit of the hot zone was marked using red duct tape to ensure a clear visual signal. Everything on the patient side of the red tape was considered potentially contaminated. Three feet from the hot zone was the warm zone and marked with yellow duct tape. This represents an area of lower potential contamination. In this area, we placed an operating room (OR) back table. This table was our 'transfer station' where we placed supplies from the cold zone to the hot zone to be used by the trauma team ( figure 4) . Mask, gloves and head covering was mandatory, but full and more stringent PPE was advised depending on the severity of the trauma and potential for contamination. This is the zone that the personnel who were in the hot zone doffed their PPE. The cold zone was outside the yellow tape and was where all supplies and persons not involved in the resuscitation were staged (figures 5 and 6). The team leader could easily direct the trauma resuscitation from this zone.",
