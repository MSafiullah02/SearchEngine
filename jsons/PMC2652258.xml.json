We have developed a consensus secondary structure model based on the sequences of nine CoVs, in which the 5\u2032 leader RNA, consisting of the 5\u2032 most 72 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 UTR in MHV, is characterized by two conserved stem\u2013loop structures, denoted SL1 and SL2.19, 20 We have shown that SARS-CoVs SL1 and SL2 can replace their MHV counterparts in an otherwise MHV gRNA; these chimeric viruses are transcriptionally active and replication competent.19 This experiment strongly supports the predicted secondary structural architecture of the 5\u2032 UTR in MHV.

We show that SL1 adopts a bipartite structure with the functional boundary of two consecutive pyrimidine\u2013pyrimidine (pyr\u2013pyr) base pairs in the middle of the SL1 helix.20 The upper region of the stem must be base paired to support viral replication to near-wild-type (WT) levels. In striking contrast, characterization of mutant viruses in which an unpaired nucleotide, A35, is deleted leads to the recovery of a diverse collection of mutant viruses that contain single-nucleotide second-site mutations in the lower half of SL1, all of which are kinetically and thermodynamically destabilizing. In addition, these viruses contain one of two single-nucleotide substitutions in the extreme 3\u2032 UTR of the genome. Nonviable mutants in this region of SL1, like SL2 mutants characterized previously,20 fail to support sgRNA synthesis. These data, taken collectively, suggest that the base of SL1 must adopt an optimized stability or kinetic lability to mediate a long-range interaction between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR that is an obligate step in the transcription of sgRNAs. The nature of this interaction is discussed.",

In addition, these NMR studies also suggested that either A35 or A36 is an unpaired extrahelical nucleotide and that the alternative pairing of U9 with A35 or A36 introduces a local destabilization in this region of SL1 stem.20 Interestingly, the predicted SL1s in other coronaviral genomes also appear to conserve this general feature of a rather weakly paired region at the base or middle of SL1, containing either or both noncanonical base pairs and extrahelical nucleotides, suggesting that this might be important for the replication of MHV and perhaps other CoVs.

From two completely independent transfections, we recovered 12 plaque-purified viruses. Sequencing of the complete 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of the 12 plaque-purified viruses revealed that only 2 of these viruses contained the SL1-\u0394A35 sequence; the remaining 10 viruses made up a diverse collection of single-nucleotide second-site substitutions in the immediate vicinity of the deleted nucleotide. Several of these plaque isolates contained identical sequences in their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. Viruses with identical sequences had similar plaque sizes. The plaque phenotypes of one example of each second-site mutation are presented in Table 1. These mutations include C37U, A36U, C34U, and U33C (from the base of SL1 toward the hairpin loop; see Fig. 1c) in the context of the parent SL1-\u0394A35 deletion. Additionally, viruses containing the SL1-\u0394A35 sequence were completely replaced by viruses containing a second-site mutation (G10A) in SL1 after only one passage in DBT cells, confirming that viruses containing only a deletion of A35 were genetically unstable and were subjected to strong negative selection. Remarkably, although diverse in sequence, all second-site mutants possess a common property: each is predicted to change a Watson\u2013Crick base pair in the WT SL1 to a noncanonical base pair (vide infra).",

Both A29G and A78G mutations in the 3\u2032 UTR share the same sequence context, GAGG, relative to the same WT context, GAAG. In addition, in at least one case (C37U), both A29G and A78G substitutions were recovered; this is consistent with the idea that each mutation, which coevolves with the 5\u2032 UTR mutation, is functionally equivalent. These data argue for a physical interaction between 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR in MHV and suggest that it is mediated by a \u201cdestabilized\u201d or \u201cdynamic\u201d SL1.",

SL1-B, SL1-C, SL1-D, SL1-\u0394C16/19/20, and SL1-\u0394A35/C34U/3\u2032A78G viruses appeared to synthesize the lowest absolute quantities of gRNAs and sgRNAs (< 32% of WT), while the other SL1 mutant viruses directed the synthesis of virus-specific RNAs to levels greater than 55% of those observed with WT virus. One nonviable mutant, SL1-A, was also assayed for the ability to synthesize sgRNA 7 and gRNAs by a series of reverse transcription (RT) PCR assays of RNA extracted from electroporated cells. Previous characterization of nonviable SL2 mutants revealed that the primary defect in these genomes was that they failed to support the transcription of sgRNAs, whereas replication of gRNA was intact,20 with the latter evidenced by a negative-sense gRNA replication intermediate. The same is true of the SL1-A mutant (Fig. 5\n).

In contrast to all of the other RNAs, the optical melting profile of the \u0394A35 SL1 RNA is well-modeled by a single two-state unfolding transition with a t\nm of 80.3 \u00b0C and with a van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H\nvH) of 118 kcal mol\u2212 1 (Table 2). Thermodynamic parameters derived from melting curves acquired using differential scanning calorimetry are in excellent agreement with the optical melts, as well as the expected \u0394H estimated from the nearest-neighbor model.23 In contrast, melting profiles obtained for the WT* RNA, as well as for the three \u0394A35 second-site revertant mutant RNAs, are broader than that obtained for the \u0394A35 RNA; they also unfold at significantly lower t\nm. A broadened unfolding transition is consistent with a superposition of two sequential two-state unfolding transitions (e.g., the lower and the upper regions of the SL1 stem) or extreme non-two-state unfolding behavior of the SL1 stem in a single transition. In both cases, fitting of these melting profiles to a single two-state transition would result in insufficient van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H\nvH) to account for the unfolding of the entire 14-base-pair stem (Fig. 6). This is exactly what we observe, with the apparent \u0394H\nvH of \u2248 70\u201375 kcal mol\u2212 1 in each case (fits not shown). Invoking a sequential two-state unfolding transition model reveals two unfolding steps with different amplitudes. If we assign the first unfolding step to the denaturation of the lower four base pairs in SL1 (predicted \u0394H\nvH\n = 38 kcal mol\u2212 1; t\nm\n = 61 \u00b0C),24 then we recover sufficient \u0394H\nvH in the second (major) transition (70\u201386 kcal mol\u2212 1) to account for unfolding of the entire molecule. From these fits, we calculate that the WT RNA is destabilized by 3.0 kcal mol\u2212 1 relative to the \u0394A35 mutant, while the three second-site revertants are destabilized by 2.1 kcal mol\u2212 1 (\u0394A35/U33C), 4.5 kcal mol\u2212 1 (\u0394A35/C34U), and 4.7 kcal mol\u2212 1 (\u0394A35/A36U) . These data reveal that each of the recovered revertant RNAs shares a common physical property with the WT RNA (i.e., all are thermodynamically destabilized relative to the \u0394A35 mutant).",

Although k\nex is a complex function of the rate constants for the opening (k\nop) and closing (k\ncl) of the base pair (where the two-state equilibrium that is constant for base-pair opening, K\nop, is defined by k\nop/k\ncl), as well as of the intrinsic rate constant for proton exchange by base catalyst (k\ntr), the magnitude of k\nex often tracks with the magnitude of k\nop and K\nop,28, 29, 30 since exchange will occur only very slowly from the base-paired state.31, 32 These data reveal that the WT* RNA is dynamically asymmetric, with imino protons above the U13\u2013U31 base pair characterized by slow k\nex (\u2264 2 s\u2212 1), while those below this base pair are \u2248 2- to \u2248 50-fold faster. For the \u0394A35 RNA, imino proton solvent exchange rates are globally quenched, but most strongly near the site of the deletion. For example, the k\nex values of U9, G10, and U31 are strongly attenuated in the \u0394A35 RNA by \u2248 10-, \u2248 32-, and \u2248 5-fold, respectively. Inspection of the base-pair dynamics for the three mutant SL1 RNAs reveals that each reintroduces or accentuates one or more specific features of the kinetic lability that characterizes the WT* RNA. For example, in all three RNAs, the imino proton solvent exchange rates of the U13\u2022U31 base pair are elevated relative to the \u0394A35 RNA by 4- to 10-fold, with some more so than in the WT* RNA. This perturbation is local in the \u0394A35/U33C RNA, but next nearest neighbor and long range in the \u0394A35/C34U and \u0394A35/A36U RNAs, respectively. The solvent exchange rate of G10 is also increased in all RNAs, most prominently in the \u0394A35/C34U RNA in the context of the new G10\u2022U34 base pairing, but also in the other two revertant RNAs (by 3- to 4-fold). These data argue that the base of SL1 through the pyrimidine base-pairing region in both the WT* and the second-site mutant SL1s recovered from the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 virus must be conformationally heterogeneous and dynamically unstable; this, in turn, allows this region to become transiently unfolded, so that a long-range interaction with the 3\u2032 UTR in MHV can occur.",

This result suggests that the nucleotide sequence of the 5\u2032 region of SL1 may also be important for viability. While this motif is not absolutely essential when the base of SL1 is predicted to be unpaired (6GAG8 to 6CUC8 in the SL1-C virus; Table 1), a lethal mutation results when the same mutation is introduced while maintaining base pairing here (in the SL1-CD virus; Table 1) (i.e., in a structural context most similar to that of WT MHV). This short sequence motif is conserved and predicted to be base paired in all group 2 CoV genomes, with the exception of SARS-CoV, which has an 5\u2032-AGGU sequence in what is predicted to be a region of SL1 weakly paired with the A extrahelical.19 Strikingly, this SL1 5\u2032-6GAG8 sequence is identical with the 5\u2032-GAG sequence recovered from second-site mutations codeposited in 3\u2032 UTR in the same viruses; this suggests the possibility that an oligomer of the same protein(s) that is capable of recognizing and/or \u201cmelting out\u201d this short purine-rich motif may well play an important role in mediating a physical interaction between the 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 UTR. An excellent candidate for this role is hnRNAP A1, since both 3\u2032 UTR mutations occur in exactly the same sequence context (5\u2032-GAAG, a near-consensus binding site for A1), and each replaces the second A with a G (a consensus hnRNAP A1 binding site),36, 37 with the 5\u2032-AG as the key specificity determinant. hnRNAP A1 possesses RNA chaperone or helix destabilization activity and has been shown to bind the 3\u2032 UTR in MHV, while hnRNP A1 and PTB both bind to the complementary strands at the 5\u2032 end of MHV RNA. There is some evidence to suggest that these proteins together mediate the formation of an ribonucleoprotein complex involving the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-end fragments of MHV RNA in vitro.38\n",

This finding suggests that the structural requirements and/or the nature of the assembled replication complexes that are capable of synthesizing full-length gRNA is distinct from those that are capable of synthesizing sgRNAs. Such a functionally bipartite structure, where a subregion of a helical stem below tandem wobble pairs is tuned to an optimum stability, is reminiscent of stem I of the U2 snRNA; here, these features have been hypothesized to allow U2 to adopt a number of mutually exclusive folded conformations during spliceosome assembly and catalysis.39\n",
