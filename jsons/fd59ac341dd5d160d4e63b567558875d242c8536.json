The development of coatings for the magnetic core of MBs was necessary to address their limitations including (a) high surface energies which lead to aggregation, (b) high chemical activity leading to their oxidation, loss of magnetic properties and dispersibility when exposed to air, and (c) biodegradation with subsequent changes in magnetic properties. Consequently, protective shells, mainly composed of agarose, cellulose, silica, silicone, porous glass, mica or polystyrene [7] , were developed to protect and preserve the stability of iron oxide MBs. These shells also allowed further functionalization, thus promoting MBs performance as recognition elements in sensing and (bio)chemical arrays [3] . Moreover, nowadays there are commercially available MBs modified with biomolecules that allow their use in different types of bioassays. So, MBs functionalized with: (a) streptavidin suitable for capturing biotinylated nucleic acids, aptamers, peptides, proteins, etc.; (b) protein A (protA) or protein G (protG), which specifically bind antibodies; (c) oligonucleotides; or (d) affinity ligands for specific capture of tagged recombinant proteins, etc. [7] can be purchased from different companies. MBs modification has resulted in important practical advantages from an analytical point of view, including (a) shorter reaction times between dissolved species and biomolecules immobilized on the surface of the beads which is also favoured by the easy dispersion of MBs into solution with only gentle shaking, (b) readily miniaturization of the assay system by using MBs as a mobile solid phase, (c) reduction of the required volumes of reagents and produced waste, and (d) obtaining lower detection limits with shorter assay times [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 145, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 383, "end": 386, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 387, "end": 389, "text": "5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 390, "end": 392, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 876, "end": 879, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1101, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1561, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2141, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Owing to all these properties, MBs constitute an attractive platform for the design of electrochemical biosensors which also add their inherent advantages such as system miniaturization, low cost and ease of operation [2] .

Although these agents are typically microorganisms found in nature, they can be modified to increase their virulence, to make them resistant to current antibiotics or vaccines, or to enhance the ability of these agents to be disseminated throughout the environment. While any germ, bacteria or virus could potentially be utilized by terrorists, there are a number of biological agents that have been recognized as being more likely to be used. This is due to their availability to terrorists and the ease by which these agents can be disseminated. Table 1 lists the main biological warfare agents (BWAs) together with the diseases they cause.

Biosensors also offer the possibility of continuous and real-time monitoring of the environment for the presence of infectious agents to allow timely implementation of preventive and protective measurements.

After binding of a streptavidin-HRP polymer to the resultant biotinylated hybrids, the modified MBs were captured by a magnetic field on the surface of TTF-modified Au/SPEs. As low as 2.5 aM aPCR product could be detected with the developed methodology. A further approach involved the obtaining of the 326-bp amplicons directly from cell cultures (daPCR) achieving E. coli detection at a concentration level of 1 cfu /100 mL with no need for culture preconcentration steps. These results demonstrated the usefulness of the developed sensors as screening or alarm devices indicating the possible presence of coliforms, together with their applicability to drinking water quality assurance (no coliform bacteria per 100 mL of water). The same research group employed similar strategies in the development of DNA sensors for the detection of a characteristic 235-bp region of the gene coding for autolysin (LytA), a specific pneumococcus virulent factor [48] . The obtained results demonstrated the usefulness of the developed methodology for rapid, simple, specific, quantitative, and sensitive detection of aPCR amplicons with a detection limit of 1.1 nM. Moreover, amplified daPCR products could be prepared with as few as 2 cfu from S. pneumoniae cultures, which make these devices very promising for the rapid identification of these bioagents.

When labelled glucose was held in the binding site of WGA to the sugar, the peak current decreased. Given that the binding between WGA and labelled glucose depended on the glucosamine concentration of glucosamine-modified beads, the concentration was estimated from the change in the peak current. Other lectins not having the binding site to glucosamine or glucose did not produce any change of peak current. Therefore, this method would be powerful for evaluation of interaction between protein and sugar chain existing at cell surface.

There are not so many examples on magnetic genosensors, although interesting approaches have also been developed in this field, where high sensitivities are obtained through different amplification systems, such as PCR or enzymatic signal amplification. Sensitivity and specificity can be improved in a high extent using magnetoimmuno-PCR approaches, although very few examples have been described based on this innovative and combined new methodology. Future prospects should be focused on the extension of these magnetobioassays to develop highly demanded easy-to-use miniaturized and multiplexed bio-platforms for the automated detection of multiple biohazard and/or bioterrorism agents on one shot. In this regard, combination of MBs-based bioassays with microfluidic devices should facilitate implementing this kind of advanced bio-platforms for the direct decentralized detection and with a short time from sample acquisition to readout.
