Others, like older adults and people with existing chronic medical conditions, are more likely to develop serious illness and have a high risk of death [32] . Human-to-human transmission of disease occurs via direct contact with the droplets saliva, discharge from the nose of an infectious person's coughs, sneezes or through contaminated objects and surfaces [32, 12] . The novel coronavirus was first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. In a few months, the virus rapidly spread throughout China and was exported to 114 countries around the world [12, 35] .",

However, reported cases continued to grow with eight new imported cases and a first confirmed local case appeared on March 14 [23] . The epidemic spreads to other Moroccan cities such as Tetouan, Rabat and Khouribga and, therefore, Morocco rapidly responded to the COVID-19 infection and the Moroccan authorities implemented a series of control measures to limit person-toperson transmission. The Ministry of interior has decided to close all schools of the country and promotes online interactive learning as an alternative [28] . Movements of Moroccan people are restricted to their living space and all gathering of more than fifty persons has become prohibited [29] . Mosques and non-essential common areas are closed except for pharmacies and stores selling necessary goods to citizen. Moreover, all international flights are suspended and all public events are canceled [29] . On March 19, the government decreed a state of health emergency and the compulsory containment of population has been declared [27] . However, a part of the population continued to work to supply the basic necessities to the confined population. Every day, infectious individuals are reported by the Ministry of Health and all individuals that have a close contact with them are identified and quarantined.",

Up to date, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to increase and changes on a daily basis. The efficacy of containment and how long it must be maintained is still unknown. The longer the period of containment, the more serious consequences on the socioeconomic situation of the country will be. In addition, the short peak period of the epidemic and large notified cases prevent health care teams from adequately preparing for and responding to the huge load of patients. Thus, lowering the peak size and the postponing the peak time of the reported cases are of major interest.",

Individuals are classified as susceptible (S), asymptomatic infectious (\u00c3), unreported symptomatic infectious (\u0128 u ) and reported symptomatic infectious (\u0128 r ). Here, we assume that reported symptomatic infectious individuals are hospitalized and can not contact susceptibles anymore. We assume also, as confirmed by Rothe et al. [13] , that asymptomatic individuals can infect susceptible individuals through an effective contact. Furthermore, MacIntyre in [15] proved that asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals share the same infection probability. Taking account of the previous assumptions, the dynamics of COVID-19 can be described as follows: Susceptibles (S) contacted with either unreported symptomatic (\u0128 u ) or asymptomatic infectious individuals (\u00c3), at an effective contact rate, c, are infected with infection probability, \u03b2, and move to the asymptomatic infectious class (\u00c3). After an average period 1/\u03b4 days the asymptomatic infectious individuals (\u00c3) become symptomatic and proceed either to the unreported symptomatic infectious (\u0128 u ), at rate \u03b4 1 , or to the reported symptomatic infectious (\u0128 r ) at rate \u03b4 2 with \u03b4 = \u03b4 1 + \u03b4 2 .

For practical reasons, it is imperative to reduce the peak-value so as not to exceed the limit capacity of hospital beds and lead the country towards an uncontrollable dramatic situation. It is also better to delay the peak appearance time to allow official health structures to prepare for such a high level of emergency. Increasing the containment rate p from 0.73 to 0.90 lead to a rapid saturation of cumulative number of reported infectious cases, ranging from 16950 to 7558 (Fig. 3.4) . Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3 .4, the peak times of reported infectious cases decreased slightly while the epidemic duration decreased significantly from 180 to 125 days and the peak-sizes decreased from 338 to 188 cases (See Table 3 ). If Moroccan government succeeded to contain more than 90% of population, then the peak size of infectious cases would be less than 188 reported cases on April, 27th, 2020. ",

However, these results could be overestimated or underestimated since many epidemiological factors are still unknown and are subject of study by researchers. Up to date, Morocco still did not reach the epidemic peak yet. Furthermore, if the containment period will last so long, Morocco must combine its actual strategy with the mass-testing or the contact-tracing strategies which allow finding and controlling the suspected cases through the susceptible population [10, 6] . For example, to the best of our knowledge, South Korea is the only country that has succeeded to greatly slow its epidemic without resorting to drastic containment [3] . The increase of the containment rate does not significantly affect the peak-time but acted differently on epidemic duration (see Fig. 3.4) . Indeed, we found that, by increasing the containment rate, there exists a threshold control reproduction number R c = 1 corresponding to a threshold containment rate p * = 0.73, below which the epidemic end-time is postponed ( Fig. 3 .5) and above which the epidemic end-time is advanced (Fig. 3.4 ). This phenomenon can be explained as follows: In the absence of containment, the whole population becomes infected within a short time. However, by increasing the rate of containment gradually to the threshold p * , the daily number of infectious individuals becomes lower and continues to significantly infect the susceptible individuals, which increases the duration of the epidemic.",
