            "text": "Vaccines have proven to be very beneficial for controlling diseases in domestic animals. Their widespread use has dramatically reduced the incidence of severe and fatal diseases in companion animals (canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, and feline panleukopenia). They have also enabled the intensification of livestock production, thus enabling great increases in efficiency in animal origin food and fiber production. In addition, animal vaccines have improved human health through control of zoonotic diseases such as rabies, brucellosis, and leptospirosis. Indeed, it can be argued that animal vaccines have had a profound impact on modern society. Without effective rabies vaccines many people would not opt to keep companion animals in their homes, and without effective vaccines for controlling major diseases in food-producing animals the availability of animal proteins for human consumption would be greatly reduced. However, in spite of the success of animal vaccines, vaccines sometimes induce adverse reactions in animals and sometimes they fail to protect animals. When making decisions regarding vaccination programs for animals, veterinarians and animal owners must weigh the risks of vaccinating vs. the risks of not vaccinating. They must also use vaccines in a manner that induces optimal protection. This article provides an overview of some of the reasons why vaccines occasionally produce adverse reactions (Table I\n) and reasons why vaccines sometimes fail to protect animals from disease (Table II\n).",

            "text": "To produce protective immunity, a vaccine must stimulate a reaction in the animal. There usually must be a reaction both at the site of injection and systemically in order to produce an effective immune response. This reaction involves extensive activity by antigen-presenting cells, production of a variety of cytokines, and alterations in the trafficking of lymphocytes within the body. In addition, if the vaccine contains live organisms, they probably need to replicate to induce effective immunity. Live viruses must infect and replicate within cells. These essential reactions to a vaccine may induce observable clinical signs. Hopefully, the reaction to the vaccine will be mild and either unnoticeable or acceptable to the animal owner.",

            "text": "To understand vaccine safety and efficacy, it is important to understand the process by which vaccines are developed and tested by vaccine producers, and licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB). The federal government regulations for the United States of America regarding veterinary vaccines are found in the Virus Serum Toxin Act (VSTA) in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR). The VSTA gives the USDA the authority to regulate veterinary vaccines in the United States. According to the 9 CFR a USDA licensed biological must be \u201cpure, safe, potent, and efficacious, and not be worthless, contaminated, dangerous, or harmful.\u201d To understand this statement, it is important to understand what is meant by safe and efficacious. The definition found in the 9 CFR for safe or safety regarding veterinary biologics is \u201cfreedom from proper ties causing undue local or systemic reactions when used as recommended or suggested by the manufacturer.\u201d This definition has two important qualifiers for the term safety. It does not state that a vaccine should produce no reaction, rather it states that a vaccine should not cause \u201cundue local or systemic reactions.\u201d This is a recognition of the fact that stimulating a potent immune response is likely to produce at least a mild local and systemic reaction in the animal. The second important point is that according to the definition the safety of the vaccine is only ensured when it is used as recommended or suggested by the manufacturer. The recommendations and suggestions can be found on the label for the vaccine. Most vaccine label statements will indicate that a particular vaccine is only for use in healthy animals of a particular species. Healthy is defined as \u201capparently normal in all vital functions and free of signs of disease.\u201d",

Millions of people were potentially exposed to live SV40 through administration of polio vaccine. To date, there is no solid epidemiologic evidence that any adverse health affects can be attributed to exposure to this agent. The SV40 virus had not yet been discovered when the human polio vaccine was produced. This raises the question of how does one test for all potential known and unknown viruses in each production lot of modified live virus vaccines. There have been numerous examples of extraneous agents contaminating veterinary vaccines. A list of these examples with appropriate references is given in Table III\n.",

Formaldehyde, used to inactivate the poliovirus in the vaccine, failed to completely inactivate the vaccine virus (Gard and Lycke, 1957; Nathanson and Langmuir, 1963). This resulted in several cases of poliomyelitis in people that had received the vaccine. There have also been cases where formaldehyde failed to inactivate the foot-and-mouth disease virus (Beck and Strohmaier, 1987; King et al., 1981) and the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Kinney et al., 1992) in their respective vaccines. In both of these cases the vaccine was shown to induce disease because of the lack of complete inactivation of the virus by the formaldehyde (Brown, 1993). An example of a failure to completely inactivate a bacterial pathogen in a killed bacterin occurred when thimerosol was used to inactivate Haemophilus somnus in an H. somnus vaccine. The thimerosol failed to kill the H. somnus. Approximately half the animals on one farm that were injected with vaccine shortly after its production developed thromboembolic meningoencephalitis and died.",

The attenuation must be shown to be stable when passaged through animals; therefore, reversion to virulence is thought to be a rare event. However, the attenuated vaccine strains may be capable of producing disease in immunosuppressed animals. Induction of disease by the vaccine organism has occasionally been reported when modified live virus (MLV) vaccines have been administered to healthy animals. However, it has occurred much more frequently when MLV vaccines are administered to unhealthy animals, by a nonrecommended route of exposure, to animals younger than the intended age for use of the vaccine, or when the vaccine is used in other than the intended species. Examples of MLV vaccines occasionally causing disease in healthy animals of the recommended species without apparent predisposing causes include the induction of rabies in dogs and cats after administration of an MLV rabies vaccine (Bellinger et al., 1983; Esh et al., 1982; Erlewein, 1981; Whetstone et al., 1984; Pedersen et al., 1978) and the induction of ovarian lesions and infertility in seronegative heifers administered MLV bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) vaccine during estrus (Smith et al., 1990; Chiang et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1989; Van der Maaten et al., 1985).

This correlates with the observation that cattle tend to be somewhat more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia after administration of MLV BVD vaccines, especially if the animals are stressed at the time of vaccination. Several commercially available canine vaccines have been shown to be capable of inducing lymphopenia and suppressing blastogenesis of peripheral blood lymphocytes (Phillips et al., 1989; Mastro et al., 1986; Kesel and Neil, 1983). Lymphopenia and suppression of blood lymphocyte blastogenesis must be interpreted with caution, however, because it may only be an indication of changes in lymphocyte trafficking between the blood and lymphatic systems rather than an indication of depressed lymphocyte function. Vaccination with an MLV BHV1 vaccine has been shown to exacerbate the lesions of infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis after experimental intraocular challenge with Moraxella bovis (George et al., 1988).",

These proinflammatory cytokines can induce a wide range of clinical signs. They may induce acute inflammation at the local site of production, they may induce rapid synthesis and secretion of acute phase proteins by the liver, they may act on the hypothalamus to induce fever and malaise, they may reduce rate of gain and feed efficiency, and in sufficiently high concentrations they may induce hypoglycemia, reduce cardiac output, cause hypovolemic shock, and cause disseminated intravascular coagulation. Lipopolysaccharide (or endotoxin) from gram-negative bacteria is one of the most potent inducers of the proinflammatory cytokines (Cullor, 1994; Ellis and Yong, 1997; Galanos and Freudenberg, 1993). A number of other bacterial components, listed in Table IV\n, have also been shown to induce proinflammatory cytokine production (Erdos et al., 1975; Henderson and Wilson, 1995; Allison and Eugui, 1995). These components are generally the most active if they are released from the degraded bacterial cell. Killed bacterins that contain excessive amounts of these bacterial components can induce clinical signs due to excessive induction of cytokine release. This is more likely to occur if multiple killed bacterins are administered at the same time and if these bacterins contain adjuvants that also induce cytokine release. The production of small amounts of proinflammatory cytokines is beneficial to the induction of a protective immune response. However, overproduction of the proinflammatory cytokines can have mild to very severe adverse side affects.",

There are at least two hypothesized mechanisms by which the immune response induced by the bacterin could potentiate pneumonia after P. haemolytica challenge. First, the high concentration of complement-fixing antibody induced by vaccination with a bacterin could rapidly activate complement if a large number of P. haemolytica organisms were introduced into the lung either naturally or artificially. This could cause a type III hypersensitivity response leading to acute inflammation in the lung and severe pneumonia. Second, antibody against cell surface antigens will opsonize the P. haemolytica in the lung and enhance phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Because there may be insufficient leukotoxin-neutralizing antibody or cell-mediated immunity to activate phagocytes, the bacteria present in the alveoli and ingested by phagocytes are not efficiently killed and may produce leukotoxin that could destroy the phagocytes. This destruction would cause the phagocytes to release their hydrolytic enzymes into the lung.",

This means that even if young animals are immunized frequently, there still may be a period when they are vulnerable to infection. Vulnerability occurs between the time that young animals lose their maternal antibody and before they develop their own active immune responses. This period can be shortened by the use of less-attenuated and/or higher titered modified live vaccines or the use of killed vaccines with high antigenic mass and strong adjuvants (Smith-Carr et al., 1997; Larson and Schultz, 1996).",

It is impossible to predict an optimal age to vaccinate a young animal, unless its antibody titers are determined.
