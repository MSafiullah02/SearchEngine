Therefore, it is essential to have a molecular diagnostic tool that allows rapid identification of the etiological agent. This will enable appropriate measures to prevent and/or treat these diseases, avoiding the unnecessary antibiotics and allowing the antiviral treatment, for example in the case of infection with influenza viruses, and also preventing the spread of a highly contagious virus within the population. Such an approach will provide rapid and accurate information, which is essential to diminish the morbi-mortality caused by these viruses, mainly in elderly and immunocompromised patients.",

            "text": "Molecular biology techniques for the detection of viral genes present in clinical specimens are playing an increasingly important role for virological diagnosis. In fact, molecular techniques have enabled major advances in the speed, specificity, and sensitivity of laboratory diagnosis of respiratory infections [Myint, 2002] . At present, diagnosis of viral infections is usually made by conventional diagnostic techniques such as virus isolation in cell culture, immunofluorescence assays, and enzyme immunoassay, a rapid method that is increasingly used for various upper respiratory viral pathogens. However, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a common method applied across the range of infectious respiratory viruses [Liolios et al., 2001; van Elden et al., 2001; Poddar et al., 2002; Coiras et al., 2003 Coiras et al., , 2004 Hu et al., 2003] . These molecular methods provide a more rapid and more reliable diagnosis of respiratory tract virus infection with the advantage of being quite independent of the type of specimen, its transport and storage, microbial contamination of the specimen, or low quantity of viral particles per sample. Such factors used to be a cause of failure in the traditional diagnostic methods. In addition, hybridization methods with molecular probes have the advantage of increased speed and specificity. They may be the only applicable techniques in the case of fastidious viruses that cannot be grown easily for phenotypic analysis [Myint, 2002] , such as the respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), or human rhinoviruses; or when subtyping is not possible with PCR assays, as in the case of human enteroviruses or adenoviruses.",

Detection of a range of respiratory virus reference strains using the RT-PCR-RLB assay in order to determine the sensitivity of the assay. Four ten-fold serial dilutions were used for each virus and initial dilutions were as follows: 100 TCID 50 in the influenza A (lanes 1-4) and B (lanes 5-8) viruses (strains A/Panama/2007/99 and B/Yamanashi/166/98, respectively); 10 \u00c03 dilution of a preparation of influenza C virus (C/Johannesburg/1/66) (lanes 9-12) with title 2048 by hemagglutination inhibition; 10 \u00c03 dilution of RSV types A (lanes 13-16) and B (lanes 17-20) (strains Long and RSN-2, respectively), equivalent to detect one infected cell by indirect immunofluorescence; 10 \u00c03 dilutions of adenovirus serotype 1 (lanes 21-24) and HPIV type 3 (strain C-243) (lanes 25-28), equivalent to 10 5 plasmid copies. The sensitivity was analyzed using two-fold serial dilutions of oligonucleotide probes bound to a nylon membrane, starting at a concentration of 0.8 mM. In the case of influenza C virus, RSV type B, adenovirus serotype 1 and HPIV type 3, the signal intensities are represented. In the case of influenza A and B viruses and RSV type A was necessary to develop another probe in order to increase the sensitivity of detection. For those probes, all at a concentration of 0.8 mM, the signal intensity differences are shown for every probe, combined or not. A grid was drawn on the film to facilitate the virus identification.",

Therefore, comparison of the results obtained by both RLB and nested PCR assays, showed a 96% correlation (see Table III and Fig. 4) . Consequently, the sensitivity was proved to be slightly higher with the nested PCR than with the RLB assay in the analysis of clinical specimens. Those results are concordant with the finding of some researchers on the lesser sensitivity of the non-radioactive hybridization method in comparison with PCR amplification [Hopert et al., 1993; Winiarczyk and Gradzki, 1999; Myint, 2002] . However, the RLB has the advantage of the absence of possible false positives due to cross-over contamination. This is of main importance to avoid misdiagnosis and to obtain accurate detection of dual infections in the same clinical specimen. In order to determine the ability of the RLB assay to detect more that one virus template within the same starting material, some combinations of viral templates were prepared and analyzed. In all cases the expected results were obtained (data not shown). Within the twenty-four clinical specimens mentioned above, one specimen was co-infected with RSV type B and adenovirus (see Fig. 4 , lane 11) and these results were confirmed by both nested PCR and RLB methods.",

Some researchers claimed that it is possible to reuse up to 40 times the same membrane [Vinj\u00e9 and Koopmans, 2000 ], but we did not reuse them more than six times to avoid giving false positives due to a high background (data not shown).",

The method can be completed within a working-day, once the nucleic acid has been obtained, and is reproducible and easy to carry out. The avoiding of cross-over contamination, as opposed to the nested PCR assay, makes this method ideal for standardization in diagnosis laboratories with few facilities. In addition, this oligonucleotide array on nylon membrane could become the first stage for developing a microarray method for testing a wide variety of infectious agents.",
