The data have been collected on infants and children with, or at risk of, vertically transmitted (mother to child) HIV infection. The design of the P2C2 HIV Study has been previously reported [1] . Two hundred and five infants (greater than 28 days old) and children with clinically diagnosed vertically transmitted HIV infection constituted group I, and 600 live-born infants born to HIV infected mothers constituted group II. Through January 1997, among the group II children, 93 of the 600 were subsequently found to be HIV infected and categorized into group II A. Four hundred and sixty-three of the 600 did not become infected with the HIV virus and constitute group II B. Forty-four infants died or were lost to follow-up before their HIV status was determined. Selected randomly for long-term followup were a subset of 216 of the group II B children. Follow-up consisted of regularly scheduled chest radiographs performed for group II at ages 3, 12, 18 months and annually thereafter in group II A, and at yearly intervals in group I infants, as well as intercurrent examinations on acutely ill children in both groups I and II.",

Thereafter, a new category was established for BV markings (Fig. 2) , scored separately from reticular densities (Fig. 3) . All radiographs initially interpreted as having either increased BV marking or reticular densities were reevaluated using the revised form. A fourth round of quality assurance was undertaken to examine inter-rater reliability for BV markings and reticular densities. This review included 39 films (12 originally read by the individual centers' radiologists as normal, 8 originally read as having increased BV markings, 7 as having reticular densities present, and 12 as having both increased BV markings and reticular densities).

However, when considered together, there was good agreement (Table 2 ). This, in part, may have been because of a lack of agreement among the radiologists as to the criteria for clearly differentiating between the two observations. The kappa statistics for nodular densities and parenchymal consolidation, considered as \u00aaabsent\u00ba vs. \u00aapresent\u00ba, were 0.56 and 0.57 respectively, both suggesting moderate agreement among the radiologists (Table 1) . However, the strength of agreement for lung volume (normal vs. low vs. increased) was low (kappa = 0.21). Since the prevalence of children with an enlarged heart as read by the original reader was only 6.9 %, and the observed and chance agreements were high (90.5 % and 87.7 % respectively) (Table 1) , the low kappa statis-885 tic of 0.23 may be misleading. It is well recognized that the statistic depends upon the proportion of children (prevalence) in each category. If more children with an enlarged heart had been included in the study but the observed agreement remained the same, the kappa statistic would be greater because the chance agreement would be lower. Among group I children, 194 had at least one cardiac echo study and at least one radiograph. Of these, there were 38 infants who had a z-score for echo-determined end-diastolic dimension (EDD) of greater than 2.0; 15 (39 %) also had notation of an enlarged heart on chest radiograph. Of the remaining 156 children who never had an EDD z-score > 2.0, 119 (76 %) never had an enlarged heart on radiography (S. E. Lipshultz, personal communication).
