For this purpose, risk is defined as the combination of the probability of an incorrect biowaiver decision with the consequences of the decision in terms of public health and individual patient risk. Based on these considerations, the monograph assesses the validity of the biowaiver and recommends its acceptance or rejection. This systematic approach to recommending or advising against a biowaiver decision is referred to in the WHO guideline.3 It is notable that these monographs do not simply apply the various guidances on biowaiver-based BE (e.g., WHO,3 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA],4 and the European Medicines Agency [EMA]5) but aim to arrive at a recommendation for or against application of the BCS-based biowaiver procedure based on current scientific \u201cbest practice.\u201d Biowaiver monographs have already been published for a variety of APIs, and these are available online at the website of the International Pharmaceutical Federation and J Pharm Sci.6, 7\n",

This level was also confirmed by Arase et al.14 Severe ribavirin-induced anemia can increase fatigue and worsen quality of life, and hence it is a frequent cause of reduction of the ribavirin dose or even discontinuation.17 This presents the physician with a dilemma, as the efficacy of ribavirin improves with increasing plasma concentrations, but the severity of anemia also becomes higher with increasing concentrations.",

Ribavirin is metabolized through two different pathways: the phosphorylation pathway, which is reversible and results in an active metabolite, ribavirin triphosphate, and a degradative pathway via de-ribosylation and hydrolysis of the amide group. The pharmacokinetic profile of ribavirin remains unchanged with hepatic dysfunction, suggesting that the liver is not a major site of ribavirin metabolism. The gastrointestinal tract, and not the liver, thus appears to be the major site of first-pass elimination.33, 39 It is possible that competition for first-pass metabolism with food components accounts at least in part for the observed positive food effect.",

Although bioequivalence of new solid oral dosage forms containing ribavirin should in principle be approved on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies, regulatory authorities may wish to determine which is the best option for assessing bioequivalence of ribavirin products in the context of their local needs.",
