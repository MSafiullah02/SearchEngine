They found that 63% of children were virus positive and concluded that the rate of otitis media complication was 61% (37% for acute otitis media and 24% for otitis media with effusion), that these risks decrease as the age increases, and that adenovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncitial virus represent more than two-thirds of otitis media complications.",

Indeed, in this study, the rate of respiratory syncitial virus infection was found to be low, probably as a result of the method used (conventional assays, type of molecular technique, RT-PCR vs. microarray, etc). Furthermore, human metapneumovirus and bocavirus were not studied [2, 3]. Thus, extensive (one-third of the children in the study were not virus positive) and \u201cstabilized\u201d viral investigations are still needed to capture the real facts, to create a precise hierarchy of all of the different pathogens involved [4]. However, the findings of Chonamaitree et al. [1] also confirm that respiratory syncitial virus and influenza virus are 2 of the main causes of complications of upper respiratory infection.",
