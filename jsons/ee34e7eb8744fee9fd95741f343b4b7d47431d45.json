The occurrence and recurrence of flu epidemics has been alluded to variability in mechanisms such temperature, climate, host contact and traveling patterns [4] . This work promotes a Gaussian-type regression model to study flu outbreak trends and predict new cases based on influenza-likeillness data for France . We show that the proposed models are appropriate descriptors of these outbreaks and can improve the surveillance of diseases such as flu. Our results show that limited data reduces our ability to predict unobserved cases. Based on laboratory surveillance data, we prototype each season according to the dominating virus (H3N2, H1N1, B) and show that high intensity outbreaks are correlated with early peak times. These findings are in accordance with the dynamics observed for influenza outbreaks in the US.",

The influenza virus, a well studied pathogen, is known for its ability to continuously invade the human host by constantly mutating and successfully evading a host's immune system. Due to constant minor (antigenic drift) and major changes (antigenic shift) in the virus surface proteins, flu vaccines are updated yearly to enhance protection against new infections. Influenza seasons occur during winter in temperate zones of the Northern and Southern hemisphere. It is estimated that some 50 million people get infected, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized from flu complications, and about 47,200 people die from flu each year.",

Effective surveillance methods enhance the preparedness and facilitate immediate response from health officials in the event of epidemic and pandemic events [3, 5, 8, 9] . The recent SARS outbreak (2002) (2003) event showed that control and containment of the outbreak was mainly based on rapid diagnosis coupled with effective patient isolation according to the modeling in [2] . A commonly, and widely used method for automatic detection of flu epidemics from time-series data was proposed by Serfling in 1963 [6] . Since then, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has implemented the Serfling methodology to parameterize a baseline model based on statistical expectations (95% confidence interval of the baseline) by training data from non-epidemic years. A surveillance system based on the Serfling methodology signals an epidemic whenever the observed time-series data exceeds a threshold. The model assumes an average mortality (\u03b2 0 ), linear trend (\u03b2 1 t), and a 52-week cyclical period denoted by \u03b2 2 cos(2\u03c0t/52)+\u03b2 3 sin(2\u03c0t/52). This model",

We estimate the parameters of the single peak model (denoted by Model 1) and multiple peak model (denoted by Model 2) through least squares for each of the 20 years of data available (Table 1) . After estimating the best fits for all 20 years, we calculate the mean, median and standard deviation (STD) of the parameters in these models. Fitting results of Model 1 yield a mean of 4.3\u00d710 5 , 4.4\u00d710 5 median and 2.2\u00d710 5 STD for the parameter estimating the intensity of the outbreaks. Similarly, we estimate the mean, median and standard deviation for the peak times and obtain a 18.4 weeks, 17.2 weeks, and 5 weeks, respectively. Table 1 shows that Model 2 describes the data better than Model 1 (adjusted R 2 ). We illustrate the actual fit of both Model for the 1991 season. These fits illustrate that the single peak model is ill specified to capture the bimodality of the data. We find strong evidence that Model 2 fits the data better than Model 1. The goodness of fit of each of these models was assessed by analyzing their residuals for each of the years fitted. We illustrate the goodness of fit of these model for the 1990-1991 flu season. Figure 3 illustrates the fits obtained with Model 2 (top-panel), Model 1 (bottom-panel) for these fits.",

In order to compare the goodness of fit of Models 1 and 2, we carry out a similar analysis for Model 2 (see Table 1 ). Our results show that Model 2 improves the data fit. That is, the adjusted R 2 estimates for the mean is improved from 0.9423 to 0.987, median from 0.9609 to 0.988 with corresponding standard deviation reduced by approximately 85% (from 0.0588 to 0.009).

Table 2 also shows that H3N2 outbreaks tend to peak sooner than H1N1 and B. We carried out a similar test to assess any significant difference among the peak times for H3N2 and those for H1N1 and B and find that peak times for H3N2 subtype outbreaks occur earlier than H1N1 and B. Note that these results are supported by the parameter estimates obtained from fitting Model 1 and Model 2. For each subtype dominant season, our goodness of fit results (adjusted R 2 ) showed that the latter model improves the fit.",

We assumed that data is available weekly (as in the current study), biweekly and monthly. Figure 5 illustrates the prediction bounds (dashed-dotted) obtained assuming weekly (left-panel), biweekly (middle-panel) and monthly (left-panel) data. Evaluating the prediction bounds for each of the scenarios shows that our ability to predict new ILI cases decreases as less data becomes available. That is, we show that for weekly available data we can predict all data points with high certainty since all data lies within the 95% confidence interval of prediction. As the data becomes more scarce (biweekly), we show that we are no longer able to predict the highest intensity data of the outbreak ( Figure 5: middle-panel) . Finally, for monthly available data, we show that we are no longer able to predict the bimodality of our data in addition to the highest intensity peak.",

Fit results implementing Model 1 and Model 2 for ILI data that is grouped according to the subtype-specific strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B) dominating in each season. Note that a1 describes the model baseline, a2 and a3 the intensity of peaks 1 and 2, with peak times at b2 and b3, and corresponding duration given by c1 and c2. Parameter b1 denotes the decay rate of each season. Non applicable findings are denoted by na. these models adjust for variability in time of peaks, intensity and duration of outbreaks. We show that these models are highly effective in describing outbreak trends, and thereby facilitate the assessment of flu patterns. The data presented in this study illustrates that flu outbreaks depict multiple peaks and therefore appropriate models are needed to regard for these dynamics. A residual evaluation of the fits of these models shows that these models are highly effective in describing the data presented here. These models show that they are highly effective in describing the data presented here, particularly, the bimodal model. The results of this study support previous observations of the correlation in the time of peak and intensity of influenza epidemics for A (H3N2) virus outbreaks for the US [7] . That is, high intensity outbreaks tend to occur early-on the season, while lower intensity outbreaks (H1N1 and B) occur later. Moreover, our study suggests that low-intensity peaks are more likely to be followed by high-intensity peaks since it is possible that frequently dominating viruses benefit from the recruitment of susceptibles during for almost two years. However, less dominating virus subtypes (H1N1 and B) do not rely on this recruiting advantage, and therefore face a continuous challenge to become established in the population as the dominating virus. Effective surveillance of infectious diseases involves the timely assessment and implementation of monitoring systems aimed to reduce morbidity and mortality while minimizing societal disruption. Influenza surveillance is a combined effort of virological identification, clinical and epidemiological monitoring of multiple source data such as influenza-like-illness, pneumonia and influenza related mortality, hospitalization, to name a few. However, in this study we show that characterizing outbreak trends improves our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving influenza epidemics, and therefore, is key for developing effective surveillance systems.",

Moreover, the prediction of future cases based on current and historical data is an essential component of effective surveillance. To this end, our current research efforts are placed in predicting flu cases for future seasons based on the descriptive models proposed herein.",
