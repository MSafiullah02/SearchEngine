            "text": "This study reports an outbreak of acute febrile respiratory illness caused by human adenovirus B [P14H11F14] in a military training center in China between May and June 2014. In total, 164 military personnel were affected, and two patients were admitted into the intensive care unit of the military regional central hospital. A HAdV-B [P14H11F14] virus was confirmed as the etiological pathogen of this acute outbreak of febrile respiratory illness based on clinical manifestations, epidemiological characteristics, specific molecular detection results, phylogenetic analysis, and serological assays. The virus was isolated by the rhabdomyosarcoma cell culture method, and the complete sequences of the E1A, penton base, hexon, and fiber genes were determined and deposited in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses indicated that the isolated strain is most closely related to some HAdV-55 strains from mainland China. However, this strain appeared to be less virulent than former HAdV-55 strains. According to the chest X-ray results of 31 affected patients, there was no radiological evidence of pneumonia. The most frequent symptoms in these patients were sore throat (95.12 %, 156/164) and tonsillitis (93.29 %, 153/164). During the course of the outbreak, incorrect response measures and some potential risk factors, such as fire training and marching training, may have exacerbated the spread of the infection. This outbreak illustrates the urgent need to improve the epidemiological and etiological surveillance of HAdV infections and to improve the ability of doctors and health officials in basic units of the Chinese army to respond effectively to febrile respiratory illness.",

These ubiquitous viruses belong to the genus Mastadenovirus in the family Adenoviridae. So far, 68 genotypes of HAdV have been recognized and classified into seven species (A-G) based on their biological and genetic characteristics (http://HAdVwg.gmu.edu/). Among these genotypes, a re-emerged HAdV-B [P14H11F14] virus has attracted increasing attention in China. This HAdV-B [P14H11F14] virus is an intertypic recombinant of HAdV-B11 and HAdV-B14. It has a HAdV-14 genome chassis, including the HAdV-14 penton gene and fiber gene, but a partial HAdV-11 hexon gene, which encodes the antigenic epitopes of the virus [5] . This virus not only could possess the virulence of HAdV-14 but also could avoid the neutralizing antibody against HAdV-14, which exists much more widely in the population than that against this HAdV-B [P14H11F14] virus [6] .",

In the early stage of the outbreak, 1-2 cases of FRI were admitted to the MTC hospital every day. This situation did not draw the attention of the MTC managers, and the outbreak was mistaken for severe seasonal influenza by the doctors of the MTC hospital. However, after 22 May, the incidence of disease suddenly increased to more than 10 cases per day, and all patients showed similar symptoms. On 29 May, in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the illness, about 798 soldiers were gathered into several crowded classrooms to attend a health lecture. The MTC managers also appealed to the regional Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for help. On 30 May, an epidemic survey was conducted by the regional CDC. At the same time, disease control and prevention measures were adopted to control the outbreak, including the cessation of training, isolation of affected individuals, environmental disinfection, and morning temperature screening.

The statistical analysis revealed that in the acute phase (within 4 days of onset), the proportion of IgA-positive samples was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, but the proportion of IgG-positive samples did not differ significantly between the patient and control groups (Table 3 ). In the convalescent phase ([12 days after onset), the proportion of IgA-positive samples was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group, and the proportion of IgG-positive samples was also significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. These results confirm that HAdV was associated with this outbreak. On the other, in hand, the healthy group, there were significant differences in the proportions of IgA-positive samples (11.8 % vs 52.9 %, P-IgA \\ 0.01, v 2 = 19.76) and in the proportions of IgG-positive samples (13.7 % vs 58.8 %, P IgG \\ 0.01, v 2 = 22.44) between the outbreak phase and the after-outbreak phase (same period of acute phase and convalescent phase).

HAdV-55 infections are often associated with severe respiratory tract diseases and pneumonia, including Recombination is an important feature of the genetic evolution of HAdV. According to our analysis, the E1A, penton base, and hexon genes of isolate SD77001 are most closely related to those of Chinese mainland strain QS-DLL_2006 and Argentinean strain ak36_2005.

            "text": "Many seroprevalence studies among military recruits have shown that lack of pre-existing immunity to some particular serotypes of pathogen is a critical factor determining susceptibility to infection. From an epidemiological perspective, outbreaks of respiratory illness in a military camp usually show higher infection rate among new recruits than among regular soldiers. However, in the present outbreak, there was no significant difference in the incidence rates of the new recruits and regular soldiers. This phenomenon suggests that the main pathogen of this outbreak is an unfamiliar pathogen to these troops, or even in this whole area. Therefore, both the recruits and regular soldiers lacked pre-existing immunity to this pathogen. Some earlier statistical analyses have shown that marching training and firing training are significantly associated with the onset of pneumonia and FRI, especially in HAdV outbreaks [19] . During a respiratory illness outbreak in an MTC in the USA, HAdV was detected on rifle surfaces [20] . During the early period of the present outbreak, the main components of the training schedule were mid-range marches and night firing training, which may have contributed to the increased patient numbers or exacerbated their symptoms. Based on this experience, appropriate measures must be identified and implemented to prevent outbreaks of respiratory illnesses in military training units, such as postponing firing training until after the peak stage of the epidemic and disinfecting the training rifles when they are transferred from one trainee to another. This FRI outbreak also illustrates the pressing need to improve the FRI epidemic response of the doctors and health officials in basic army units. In the acute FRI outbreak reported here, about 25 new cases appeared with the same symptoms in the 15 days after 7 May. However, this situation did not alert the MTC managers or health professionals. No correct diagnostic procedures were implemented, no epidemiological investigation was commenced, and the supervisory CDC received no information about the new cases. When a large wave of new cases (n = 79) appeared between 22 May and 30 May, in an effort to control the outbreak, the MTC healthy managers gathered about 798 soldiers into several crowded classrooms for health education, which may have contributed greatly to the transmission of the disease, and 7 days later, the highest incidence peak of the entire outbreak was observed (Fig. 1) . Had the health officials dealt with the outbreak correctly from the very beginning, the spread of this FRI may have been restricted to a much smaller scale.",

Therefore, it was still difficult to ensure this HAdV-B55-like virus was the only pathogenic agent responsible for this outbreak. It is possible that some other pathogens were involved in this outbreak. In some previously published descriptions of outbreaks of HAdV infection among military trainees, the co-circulation of two or more types of HAdV had already been reported. Second, the members of the healthy control group were randomly selected from the asymptomatic soldiers in the same MTC on 30 May. At the same time, the disease prevention and control measures had been implemented. None of the healthy controls showed any respiratory tract disease symptoms during the outbreak period. However, these healthy controls had not been screened by laboratory detection methods such as viral nucleic acid detection. Considering the results of the IgA and IgG detection in the healthy control group, there may have been asymptomatic infection cases hiding in the healthy control group. Many ''healthy control group'' members had already been infected by this HAdV virus. In a future outbreak study, the healthy controls should be selected from a camp where the virus was not present and be screened using laboratory detection methods to differentiate the asymptomatic infection cases.",
