            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are ubiquitous enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses, represented by strains 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, and possibly SARS-CoV. Except for SARS-CoV, the etiological agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS; Ksiazek et al., 2003), HCoV have primarily been associated with mild upper and lower respiratory tract diseases, with the common cold representing the typical HCoV-induced pathology (Myint, 1995). However, over the years, HCoV have regularly been linked to other pathologies, such as severe respiratory distress syndrome in newborns (Sizun et al., 1995, Gagneur et al., 2002), and as important triggers of exacerbations of acute asthma (Nicholson et al., 1993, El-Sahly et al., 2000). More recently, both previously (229E and OC43) and newly described (NL63 and HKU1) HCoV strains were associated with more severe acute lower respiratory tract pathologies, including pneumonia, in both infants and immunocompromised patients (Woo et al., 2005, Gerna et al., 2006). Even though it is recognized that HCoV primarily infect airway epithelial cells and cause diseases of the respiratory tract in humans, viral material was reported in other cells and tissues. For example, HCoV-229E infection of human monocytic cell lines and of primary monocytes/macrophages was reported (Collins, 2002, Desforges et al., 2006). Infection of peritoneal macrophages (Patterson and Macnaughton, 1982) and murine dendritic cells expressing human aminopeptidase N (APN; Wentworth et al., 2005) by HCoV-229E suggests that this virus may use myeloid cells to disseminate to other tissues, where it could provoke other types of pathologies.",

Indeed, as previously suggested for HCMV (Smith et al., 2004), blood-borne monocytes and their differentiated counterparts, macrophages, could be involved in hematogenous dissemination of HCoV-229E to host tissues, including the CNS, as we previously showed this virus to be neuroinvasive (Arbour et al., 2000). In these examples of viral spread, pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and chemokines and their receptors, were shown to play a crucial role in leukocyte activation and their dissemination from blood to various tissue.",

We show that human monocytic cells were susceptible to infection and that cell death was induced in a portion of the cells, in correlation with the initial MOI for the 229E strain. The THP-1 cell line presented a pattern of infection very similar to that of primary monocytes. Both cell types were activated following infection, as shown by the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, infection by HCoV-229E increased cell motility and chemokine-driven cell migration. Furthermore, the establishment of a persistent infection in monocytes/macrophages is consistent with the possibility that these cells serve as a reservoir and potential vector for virus dissemination to host tissue.",

Therefore, primary cultures of monocytes did not survive long enough to characterize the establishment of a long-term infection. The THP-1 cells allowed us to investigate this possibility. When HCoV-229E infection of both primary monocytes and THP-1 cells was performed at a MOI of 0.1, the kinetics of infection was similar, as shown by infectious virus production (Fig. 2A) and detection of viral antigens (Fig. 3A).

Indeed, even though there was a constitutive production of low amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 and of the chemokine CXCL10 in primary monocytes, of the chemokine CXCL11 in THP-1 cells and of the chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) by both types of cells, the level of production of these molecules was clearly increased after infection (Fig. 4). A slight but reproducible increase in IL-16 and CXCL12 production was also observed following infection of the THP-1 cells and primary monocytes, respectively (Fig. 4). Several other inflammatory factors (see complete list in Fig. 4) were produced by both cell types, without significant modulation after infection, including high levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, CXCL1, MIF, CCL3, IL-6 and CXCL8. Strikingly, even though the steady-state profile of cytokine/chemokine was not exactly similar in THP-1 and primary monocytes, the production of the same four cytokines/chemokines, TNF-\u03b1, CCL5, CXCL10, and CXCL11, was reproducibly modulated the same way in either type of cells following HCoV-229E infection.",

While pro-MMP-9 appeared to be constitutively expressed in the THP-1 cell line and primary monocytes, an increased expression was observed after 72 hpi with HCoV-229E, when compared to mock-infected cells (Fig. 5B). PMA was used as a positive control (data not shown). Even though PMA induced an increase in the expression of pro-MMP-2 and MMP-9 in THP-1 cells, no modulation of MMP-2 was detected upon infection of either cell type (data not shown). Quantitation of active MMP-9 by fluorescence ELISA revealed that the amount of MMP-9 secreted in the medium started to increase at 48 hpi and that the differences in MMP-9 secretion were statistically significant (t-test) between mock- and infected-cells (Fig. 5C).",

However, in our study, only viral RNA was detected (data not shown). This could be explained by virus attachment to cell surface lectin-like molecules, as shown for SARS-CoV (Lau and Peiris, 2005) and other enveloped viruses such as HIV, Dengue and hepatitis C virus (Altmeyer, 2004). Alternatively, it may be related to the differentiation state of monocytes and its correlation with susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Indeed, promonocytic THP-1 cells, which were susceptible to a weak productive HCoV-OC43 infection, represent less differentiated cells than primary monocytes/macrophages. Upon PMA-induced differentiation, they lost susceptibility to infection, which is consistent with monocytes being only susceptible to infection during a brief period during their differentiation. This was also suggested for HIV-1 (Schuitemaker et al., 1992, Pauza et al., 1988), HCMV (Weinshenker et al., 1988) and measles virus (Helin et al., 1999).",

A weakly productive long-term HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells at lower initial MOI was also previously reported for HIV-1 (Mikovits et al., 1990) and cells remained responsive to PMA-induced differentiation into macrophage-like cells and produced more infectious virus (Konopka et al., 1993). Moreover, even though monocytes have a life span of only a few days in circulation (Cline et al., 1978), a long-term infection in THP-1 monocytic cells is highly relevant, since during their migration towards tissue, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which are long-lived cells that can harbor virus for a long period of time. Persistently infected THP-1 cells had an increased motility and were still responsive to chemokines (Fig. 6A), which strongly suggests that monocytes/macrophages could be a reservoir and potential vector for HCoV-229E spread into host tissue, as suggested for HCMV (S\u00f6derberg-Naucler et al., 1994, Sinclair and Sisson, 1996). Moreover, we show that HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes leads to their activation, as indicated by the production of several inflammation-related mediators and responsiveness to chemokine gradients.",

However, the increase in IL-16 was not seen in primary monocytes, as these cells produced it constitutively (Fig. 4). Others have reported a faint increase in CXCL8 production and no production of TNF-\u03b1 following HCoV-229E infection of THP-1 cells (Yen et al., 2006). This apparent discrepancy may be due to their use of THP-1 cells manipulated to overexpress DC-SIGN, which could have altered their capacity to produce TNF-\u03b1, or to the fact that they measured TNF-\u03b1 production at 1 dpi, whereas we analyzed its production over a 3-day period. The same may apply to the apparent discrepancy in the production of CXCL8 in HCoV-229E infected THP-1 cells (Yen et al., 2006). Constitutive production of high levels of cytokines/chemokines by primary monocytes (Fig. 4) is not surprising: for instance CXCL8, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were shown to be constitutively produced by human monocytes (Naldini et al., 2006).",

Interestingly, we show that TNF-\u03b1 production was modulated by viral replication in a MOI-dependent manner in both cell types (Fig. 5A). This cytokine was linked to some asthmatic complications and in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006), two pathologies associated with sporadic HCoV infection (Nicholson et al., 1993, Sizun et al., 1995, El-Sahly et al., 2000, Gagneur et al., 2002). On the other hand, TNF-\u03b1 was shown to increase ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells (Weirtheimer et al., 1992) including those of the BBB (Defazio et al., 1998), and ICAM-1 is known to facilitate the passage of leukocytes (including monocytes) through the BBB (Dietrich, 2002). Therefore, considering the neuroinvasive properties of HCoV-229E, the production of TNF-\u03b1 by infected monocytes could lead to an increase spread of these cells towards other tissues, including the CNS.",

The increased production of CCL5 in HCoV-229E-infected cells is also of interest as this chemokine has a chemoattracting potential for memory and activated T cells (Schall et al., 1990), NK cells (Loetscher et al., 1996), dendritic cells (Lin et al., 1998), and monocytes (Fine et al., 2001). Therefore, migration of HCoV-229E-infected monocytes into the respiratory tract could lead to recruitment of additional immune cells that may eventually cause an uncontrolled upregulation of inflammatory molecules, as is the case in ARDS. Indeed, an increased level of expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) was seen in patients with ARDS (Corbel et al., 2002), an interesting observation considering that HCoV-229E was associated with severe respiratory distress syndrome in newborns (Gagneur et al., 2002). Moreover, it was recently shown that the in vitro recruitment of human peripheral blood leukocytes exposed to supernatants of SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E-infected THP-1 DC-SIGN cells (Yen et al., 2006) was significantly higher compared to supernatant from uninfected cells.",

A release of cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, during infection may also be involved in the upregulation of MMP in monocytes/macrophages (Welgus et al., 1992). The significant induction of TNF-\u03b1 production by monocytes after HCoV-229E infection (Fig. 5A) suggests a synergistic effect between MMP-9 and TNF-\u03b1 to facilitate the migration of monocytes into tissues, including the CNS. The MMP-9 production of monocytes was enhanced in the presence of chemokines such as CCL5 and CXCL12 (Webster and Crowe, 2006). A role for neutrophil-derived MMP-9 (Zhou et al., 2002) was also suggested in the breakdown and integrity loss of the BBB (Zhou et al., 2003) during MHV infection of the CNS.",

Furthermore, the increased chemokine-driven migration of infected cells suggests that migration of HCoV-229E-infected monocytes towards tissue could be facilitated during an inflammatory response in which the production of CCL2 and CCL5 would be increased within the inflamed tissue. The production of CCL5 appear more important than that of CCL2 in facilitating migration of HCoV-229E infected cells towards tissue, since the increased migratory capacities of infected cells were more evident towards CCL5 (Fig. 6). The increased responsiveness to CXCL12 (Fig. 6) is also very interesting since this chemokine is constitutively produced in tissues such as the CNS (Cartier et al., 2005). This latter chemokine was shown to facilitate the passage of lymphocytes and monocytes through endothelial cells in vitro (Wu et al., 2000) and was implicated in the baseline traffic of T cells and monocytes in the CNS (Calderon et al., 2006).",

Either type of monocytes may propagate a viral infection (Reuter et al., 2004). Therefore, virus-induced monocyte activation could facilitate their passage through endothelial cells towards host tissue, especially the CNS in immunocompromised individuals, as reported for murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (Reuter et al., 2004).

This could have important consequences on the development of more serious respiratory tract diseases and even in the capacity of the virus to invade other tissues. Even though HCoV-229E is a respiratory pathogen, our previous studies did demonstrate that it has neuroinvasive properties. Since monocytes have access to CNS, our observation that monocytes/macrophages support coronavirus replication is consistent with the possibility that monocytes may contribute to HCoV-229E spread to the CNS. Moreover, the long-term infection of the THP-1 monocytic cell line strongly suggests the possibility of a viral reservoir within monocyte subsets and is consistent with human monocytes harboring HCoV and participating in virus spread towards tissue in general and particularly the CNS.",
