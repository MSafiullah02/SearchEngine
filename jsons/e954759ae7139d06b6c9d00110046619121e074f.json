It also inhibits bacterial contamination, and this can be a reason for the better reagent stability. Shephard and Whiting (17 ) compared four protein precipitants-BC, BTC, trichloroacetic acid, and sulfosalicylic acid for nephelometry-and found that BC had good precision and agreed most closely with the trichloroacetic acid-Ponceau S dye-binding method. In our hands, the nephelometric method of Shephard and Whiting was linear 50 -1000 mg/L protein, similar to the measuring range (78 -1250 mg/L) reported by those authors (17 ). In imprecision studies, the precision and linearity of our method were better than those of the nephelometric method. Nephelometers are also expensive and are not used in many in small-and medium-sized clinical laboratories.",

During the SARS epidemic, more than 1700 infected cases have been reported in Hong Kong. The disease is infectious, particularly within the healthcare setting. Early diagnosis is essential to control the spread of SARS by identifying and isolating infected patients (1, 2 ) . Diagnostic tests have been developed that detect either antibodies to or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) products of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS-CoV antibodies can be reliably detected only around 20 days after disease onset (3, 4 ) . Quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays, on the other hand, allow the detection of SARS-CoV within the first week of illness. Our recent study showed that detection sensitivity could approach 80% for plasma and serum samples from SARS patients (5, 6 ) . Aside from improving the analytical and clinical sensitivity of the RT-PCR as-says, it is also possible to develop new types of assays on the basis of other biological variables and/or technologies. In the past few years, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) has been applied to the discovery of diagnostic proteomic signatures for cancers such as prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (7, 8 ) . Here we report the presence of plasma proteomic signatures in serial blood samples from eight pediatric patients with SARS and their correlation with SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in plasma (6 ) .",

The serial blood samples used in this study were collected from the patients during sample collection for routine blood tests, which included the monitoring of lymphocyte counts and biochemical indices and enzymes. The convalescent sera of these patients were tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-infected cells in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (4 ). All patients were serologically positive for SARS-CoV IgG antibody. As negative controls, blood samples from 15 pediatric patients who suffered from fever and infections other than SARS were collected.

After air-drying, sinapinic acid matrix in 500 mL/L acetonitrile containing 5 mL/L trifluoroacetic acid was added to each array.

We identified 41 proteomic features that were positively associated with SARS. Among these 41 proteomic features, normalized peak intensities of 24 proteomic features significantly decreased on recovery (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P \u03fd0.05). The Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between these 24 proteomic features and SARS-CoV RNA in the serial plasma samples from the eight pediatric SARS patients. Fifteen were positively correlated with the plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations (all P values \u03fd0.05; see Table 1 in the Data Supplement that accompanies the online version of this Technical Brief at http://www.clinchem.org/content/ vol50/issue8/). Fig. 1 illustrates the similarities between the changes in the plasma concentrations of SARS-CoV RNA and the peak intensities of three representative SARS-specific proteomic features during the treatment period.",

            "text": "Clinical Chemistry 50, No. 8, 2004 Recently, the reliability of the studies using SELDI-TOF MS technology has been questioned. It has been suggested that the findings may be biased by artifacts related to the nature of the clinical samples used, the experimental details, the sample storage conditions, the mass spectrometric instruments, and/or bioinformatic analysis (11) (12) (13) . We believe that such problems can be overcome by the use of good experimental design and stringent criteria for defining a proteomic feature as disease specific so that significant proteomic features could be validated at multiple levels. This study illustrates the success of a stringent and systemic approach for analyzing SELDI proteomic data in the identification of SARS-specific proteomic features. With better fulfillment of different data-filtering criteria, it will become less likely that identified proteomic features are identified by chance and that the identified features result from bias in patient selection. In this study, although 3 filtering criteria were set up for the identification of SARS-specific proteomic features, there were 15 significant proteomic features identified. Later ROC curve analyses showed that all of these SARS-specific proteomic features were potential biomarkers for detection of SARS.",

            "text": "Characterization of these circulating SARS-specific proteomic features may help us to understand the disease pathology and patient response. It has been suggested that the SELDI-TOF MS technology has a preference toward detection of high-abundance protein molecules, such as acute-phase reaction proteins. The 11.7-kDa haptoglobin \u2423-subunit (14 ) and 11.6-and 11.8-kDa isoforms of serum amyloid A (15 ) have been identified by this technology as cancer-associated proteomic features. It is possible that some of the SARS-specific proteomic features identified in this study are also acute-phase proteins. For example, the SARS-specific proteomic feature at m/z 11 710 may be the haptoglobin \u2423-subunit (11.7 kDa) or the 11.6-or 11.8-kDa serum amyloid A isoforms. The proteomic feature at m/z 78 300 may be transferrin (78 kDa) or clusterin (\u03f380 kDa). The proteomic feature at m/z 165 600 may be doubly charged (2 H \u03e9 ) fibrinogen (332 kDa). A recent Chinese study has shown that serum concentrations of the acute-phase proteins complement 4 and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in patients with SARS than those in patients with other pneumonias and in healthy individuals (16 ) . In cats, feline coronavirus infection also led to increased concentrations of haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, \u2423 1 -acid glycoprotein, IgG, and IgM (17 ) .",

SELDI TOF-MS, which can be performed in a 96-well microplate format, is a high-throughput technology.
