With lack of any effective vaccine or drug currently available, scientists and doctors are conducting a series of clinical studies involving affected patients. 7, 8 Although Chinese researchers are struggling to find effective treatments and preventive measures, and actively conduct clinical trials, one aspect of the clinical trials has been surprisingly overlooked.

In clinical trials, the investigator or applicant should first consider how to protect the rights of the subjects. Specifically, the subjects' rights of voluntary participation, the right to know, the right to privacy, the right to security, the right to timely treatment and other rights should be protected. 9, 11, 12 Clinical trials of drugs are usually divided into four phases: phases I, II, III and IV. Each phase has different requirements and objectives, and the number of cases required is also different. 9 Some of the drugs currently registered are only effective in vitro, and the safety has not been proven. 10 For example, the study of Chinese patent medicine Shuang-Huang-Lian oral liquid, according to preliminary experiments, in vitro cell experiments showed that it could effectively inhibit COVID-19. However, it has been used in randomized, open-label, blank-controlled, and multi-center clinical trials. 13 It should be noted that many laboratories have conducted preliminary experiments and hope to enter clinical trials as soon as possible. Whether this conforms to the standardized process of drug clinical trials, this is a matter of concern. From the perspective of study design, it Meanwhile, staging can also achieve the purpose of protecting participants. Some studies lack the statistical basis for sample-size calculation. For example, one study treated COVID-19 by atomizing a Chinese medicine injection. 14 Because this is a new route of administration, a phase I clinical trial should be conducted. The sample size is usually less than 100, and the sample size in this study is 119. 14 During the COVID-19 outbreak, doctors may use experimental drugs on infected participants, relax the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and fail to provide reasonable compensation or inform vulnerable patients about the risks of the trials, the ethics committee should pay special attention to these issues. 15 Specifically, ethical issues may also need to be resolved based on the characteristics of patients, including elderly patients and people with disorders of consciousness. 9, 15 In addition, special attention should be paid to the biosafety level of the laboratory, which may lead to virus leakage.",

Clinical studies also need to carefully combine short-term efficacy evaluation with long-term efficacy indicators. For example, a clinical study is about nebulized Xiyanping injection in the treatment of COVID-19. 14 Xiyanping injection is the extract of Andrographis paniculate, which is a Chinese patent medicine approved by China to treat bronchitis. 16 However, the use of Xiyanping still remains a controversial issue since the safety impacted factors are not completely clear. The study indicated that age and the combination of Xiyanping and Ribavirin were independent risk factors for the severity of adverse drug reactions. 16 According to the drug instructions, the administration route of Xiyanping is intramuscular injection and intravenous drip, without atomization. 16 Unreasonable use of traditional Chinese medicine may cause some potential adverse reactions, so the potential risks may outweigh the benefits. Besides, in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug, researchers need to conduct long-term statistics on some 7 indicators, after the participants are discharged from the hospital, such as disability rate, mortality rate and quality of life.",
