Severe patients additionally met at least one of the following conditions: (1) Shortness of breath, respiratory rate \u226530 times/min, (2) Oxygen saturation (Resting state) \u226493%, or (3) PaO2 / FiO2 \u2264300mmHg. A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study, which were all Wuhan residents and laboratory confirmed cases. The flowchart of patient enrollment is shown in Fig. S5. The patients were divided into two groups according to above-mentioned conditions, including 27 mild cases (67\u00b75%) and 13 severe cases (32\u00b75%). Three patients in the severe group died on day 15, 18 and 21 after disease onset.

There were 4 patients co-infected with fungi in the severe case group. To examine the impact of fungal infection on the results, we performed the analyses by excluding the data of the 4 cases with fungal co-infections from the severe patient group, and similar kinetic changes of different subsets of PBMCs were observed when these 4 cases were excluded.

Additionally, T cells are important for dampening overactive innate immune responses during viral infection.15-16 Thus, a loss of T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in aggravated inflammatory responses, while a restoration of T cell numbers may alleviate them. In line with this hypothesis, we observed that the kinetic changes of T cell counts are reversely correlated with the kinetic changes of most examined cytokine levels in the peripheral blood in severe COVID-19 patients. While T cell counts drop to their lowest levels at 4-6 days after disease onset, serum IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 levels reach their peaks.
