However, a few carefully and safely conducted studies in young children have provided insights into possible pathophysiologic features as they relate to developmental milestones and disease expression. When bronchoalveolar lavage has been performed in young wheezing children, a 3-fold increase in total cells, most significantly lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages/monocytes, compared with counts seen in healthy children has been noted. In addition, levels of leukotriene B4 and C4, prostaglandin E2, and the potentially epithelium-derived 15-hydroxyeicosattetranoic acid were all increased.16\n",

However, similar pathologic changes were seen in atopic children without asthma.18 Taken together, it appears that the inflammatory and structural changes associated with asthma occur sometime after infancy during the early preschool years, when children experience more persistent symptoms of airway dysfunction.",

Genetic factors also contribute significantly to disease expression and severity. Asthma is genetically classified as a complex disorder; as such, it does not follow simple Mendelian inheritance characteristics. Hundreds of genetic association studies on asthma-related phenotypes have been conducted in different populations; these have been recently reviewed.57 Although the importance of gene-environment interactions in the expression of disease has recently been highlighted,58 the complexities involved in analyzing these relationships from a functional perspective have proved challenging.59 Recent pharmacogenetic evaluations in relationship to chronic \u03b2-agonist use60 and corticosteroid efficacy have provided new insights into the variability of response in asthmatic patients.",

The formation of antigen-specific IgE antibody to aeroallergens (eg, mites, trees, grasses, and animal dander)\u2014the development of allergic sensitization but not necessarily of allergic disease\u2014does not usually occur until 2 to 3 years of life. Thus aeroallergen-induced asthma is uncommon during the first year of life, begins to increase in prevalence during later childhood and adolescence, and peaks in the second decade of life. Once established in genetically predisposed individuals, IgE-mediated reactions are a major contributor both to acute asthmatic symptoms and chronic airway inflammation. Chronic low-level exposure to indoor allergens, dust mite and cockroach in particular, might play a major role in both asthma inception and subsequent provocation of symptoms.61 Although a wide variety of inhaled allergens can provoke asthma symptoms, sensitization to house dust mite,62 cockroach,63\nAlternaria species,64 and possibly cat40 are important in the pathogenesis of asthma. Dog, but not cat, ownership during infancy has been shown to reduce the subsequent development of allergic sensitization and atopic dermatitis65; numbers of pets and not the type of furred pet might also reduce future risk.66 These diverse findings indicate that these relationships are indeed complex and might involve gene-environment interactions. Pollen immunotherapy in school-aged children with only allergic rhinitis at the start of treatment has been demonstrated to reduce significantly the subsequent risk of the development of airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma.67\n",

The increased tendency for viral infections to produce lower airway symptoms in asthmatic subjects might be related, at least in part, to interactions among allergic sensitization, allergen exposure, and viral infections acting as cofactors in the induction of acute episodes of airflow obstruction.72, 73 Abnormalities in the innate immune response that would prevent viral replication in airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects have recently been demonstrated.68\n",

The symptoms are most intense for 5 to 10 minutes and usually resolve within 15 to 30 minutes after exercise cessation. Under most circumstances, the degree of bronchoconstriction is rarely severe enough to be life-threatening, and such a situation almost invariably reflects advanced untreated disease, confounding triggering factors (ie, concomitant allergen or irritant exposure), or both. Objective documentation of airflow obstruction after an exercise challenge test (\u226515% decrease in FEV1; \u226510% if symptoms accompany the decrease in FEV1)79 or a convincing history with an appropriate response to prophylactic or rescue medication is required to make the diagnosis of EIB. Exercise challenge testing, particularly in elite athletes,80 must be of sufficient intensity and duration to be able to accurately diagnose the condition, keeping in mind that such confounding problems as vocal cord dysfunction might need to be considered in the differential diagnosis.81 The pathophysiology of EIB can involve exaggerated responses to heat and water loss and the release of inflammatory mediators as a consequence of these thermodynamic alterations.82\n",

Chen et al92 evaluated the influence of socioeconomic status, which they related to stress, on cytokine generation. With peripheral blood cells from asthmatic subjects but not healthy control subjects, lower socioeconomic status was associated with greater generation of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IL-13. These data are a further indication that stress can, in asthmatic subjects, promote an inflammatory profile.

Because asthma is a variable but chronic disease (or syndrome), specific treatment will need to be adjusted both acutely, or during exacerbations, and chronically in the context of eliminating or reducing both impairment and risk because they dynamically fluctuate over time to achieve acceptable control. a stepwise approach has been adapted for treatment to accomplish these goals (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthgdln.htm).4 The basis of the stepwise approach is to increase the number, frequency, and dose of medications with increasing asthma severity until the patient's disease has been put under \u201ccontrol\u201d (ie, achieving optimal control for that patient). Once control has been established, step-down therapy can be attempted to minimize medication burden, when possible. Recently, the concept of response to therapy has also received increasing attention. Responsiveness is the ease with which asthma control is achieved by therapy. Responsiveness to an asthma treatment is highly variable, and it is likely that both genetic and phenotypic characteristics contribute to this intrapatient and interpatient variability in response over time.96, 97\n",

            "text": "In the last few years, a number of published clinical trials with new therapeutic agents or novel treatment strategies are noteworthy based on their potential effect in initiating or adjusting medication based on this stepwise severity scheme. The first set of trials pertains to the treatment of preschool wheezing children. One trial98 evaluated continuous ICS treatment (2 years receiving therapy with an ICS and the third year receiving as-needed medication, which served as the observation year) in children who had a positive asthma predictive index (API). Children with positive APIs in the first 3 years of life have about a 65% chance of having clinically diagnosed asthma by age 6 years. During the 2 years of treatment with a low-dose ICS (fluticasone, 88 \u03bcg twice daily) compared with matching placebo, treated children had significantly greater numbers of episode-free days and reduced exacerbations requiring oral steroid treatment. However, after discontinuation of the ICS treatment at the beginning of the observation period, episode-free days were no different than in the placebo group within about 3 months. Reduced airway resistance in the ICS group at the end of the treatment period was no longer evident at the end of the observation period. Thus early recognition and treatment of high-risk children can reduce symptom burden while receiving therapy but does not appear to alter the natural history of asthma.98 Similar negative results were seen when intermittent ICS therapy was prescribed.99 Intermittent therapy with either an ICS or montelukast at the onset of respiratory tract symptoms was able to reduce symptom burden during these illnesses; however, these beneficial effects were only seen in children with positive APIs.100 In a third study in preschool-aged children with moderate-to-severe, presumed virus-induced wheezing, pre-emptive treatment with high-dose fluticasone (750 \u03bcg twice daily at the start of upper respiratory tract symptoms) compared with placebo reduced the use of rescue oral corticosteroids. However, treatment with fluticasone was associated with a smaller gain in height and weight.101 Finally, in preschool children presenting to a hospital with mild-to-moderate wheezing associated with a presumed viral infection, oral prednisolone was not superior to placebo in reducing the duration of the hospital stay.102 These disparate results in this age group might relate to host (eg, presence or absence of atopy103), viral (cause/pathogenicity of viral infection, such as rhinovirus vs RSV104), or both factors that confer differential responses to these types of interventions. More studies are obviously needed before precise recommendations can be made in this age group.",

Moreover, the numbers of patients needed to be prospectively evaluated to ascertain the precise risks involved might be too large to realistically enroll.108 Overall, however, the benefits of combination therapy appear to outweigh the risks in the majority of patients.
