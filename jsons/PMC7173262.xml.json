Since cryo-EM does not need crystals, many macromolecular complexes that are difficultly crystallized are now ready for structural studies; thus, more and more structural biology laboratories are becoming interested in studying the structures of large macromolecular complexes. However, how to obtain enough highly purified specimen suitable for cryo-EM is therefore becoming a new bottleneck, which has restricted the wide application of cryo-EM technology.",

The most common baculovirus used for gene expression is AcMNPV (Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus), which has a large, circular double-stranded DNA genome (about 130 kb) that can accommodate very large exogenous DNA fragments (Jarvis, 2009). However, it is not easy to introduce foreign genes by conventional molecular cloning methods due to the large size of AcMNPV genome. Therefore, researchers have modified the AcMNPV genome to allow effective foreign gene insertion by site\u2013specific transposition or homogenous recombination (Hitchman et al., 2012, Luckow et al., 1993). The widely-used Bac to Bac baculovirus expression system is one successful example (Jarvis, 2009).",

In the first strategy insect cells are infected with multiple types of baculoviruses, each of which carries one or two gene expression cassettes (GECs). This strategy, which involves molecular cloning, is relatively simple and has been successfully applied by many research groups using the pFastBac series vectors (Birnbaum et al., 2014, Chung et al., 2006, Hu et al., 2003, Kee et al., 2010, Wan et al., 2017, Yoo et al., 2009). However, when multiple types of baculoviruses are used, the total number of infectious viruses added to the expression culture should be comparable to the upper limited number of the single baculovirus infection. This will inevitably lead to a lower protein expression level. In addition, the expression levels of the individual subunits are often imbalanced, which would result improper complex assembly.",

The commercial pFastbac-Dual vector features two promoters for expression of two proteins simultaneously. Similar triple or quadruple expression vectors have also been built using traditional molecular cloning methods (Belyaev and Roy, 1993). The MultiBac system generates multi-GEC donor and acceptor vectors from junior plasmids carrying individual GECs by homing endonuclease-based multiplication module (Berger et al., 2004). Then the final transfer plasmid is produced by Cre-mediated recombination between the donor and acceptor (Berger et al., 2004). Recently, the biGBac method enabled rapid multiple GECs assembly for large multiprotein complexes expression by a modular \u201cMix and Match\u201d approach (Weissmann and Peters, 2018, Weissmann et al., 2016). Yet the problem of unequal subunit stoichiometry still exists.",

            "text": "The third strategy is the polyprotein strategy that has been used by coronaviruses to produce multiple functional nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are involved in the assembly of the replication-transcription complex (RTC) that catalyzes viral replication and transcription (Bartlam et al., 2005). The nsps are encoded in open-reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b and synthesized initially as two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. During or after synthesis, these polyproteins are cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into 16 nsps (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). These nsps, together with other viral proteins and possible cellular proteins, assemble into a membrane-bound RTC (Sawicki et al., 2007). This strategy has been recently exploited to express protein complexes using baculovirus system (Nie et al., 2014, Vijayachandran et al., 2011). By this strategy, individual subunits are separated by protease cleavage sites and expressed as a long polyprotein. In vivo processing of the polyprotein allows the proper assembly of the multiprotein complex. This method is very good for balancing expression levels and achieving the correct subunit stoichiometry (Vijayachandran et al., 2011). However, when expressing a very large multiprotein complex, the DNA fragment encoding the polyprotein is very long. It is usually not easy to build such a large transfer plasmid in the average laboratory. In addition, with increasing gene length, gene synthesis becomes more expensive and time-consuming. Other potential problems include inefficient virus amplification and instability of the recombinant baculovirus that is due to the insertion of a large foreign gene.",

First, the transfer vectors carrying genes of multiple subunits need to be designed for easier molecular cloning. Considering the increased difficulty of molecular cloning with larger constructs (Carter and Shieh, 2010), vectors that allow direct selection for positive transformants are welcome. Second, one tagged subunit is often used to purify entire multiprotein complexes. However, due to the lack of prior knowledge, we usually have to screen the optimal tagged subunit that can yield the most efficient purification of the complex. An efficient experimental scheme is needed to decrease the labor of building these screening vectors.

The sooner the problems are identified, the faster they can be solved.",

To simplify vector construction and obtain more homogenous samples, the polyprotein strategy and Gibson assembly were used to construct the transfer plasmid. The design of a LacZ-alpha cassette allows easier selection of positive recombinants with large DNA inserts by blue-white screening. A univector plasmid-fusion system (UPS) strategy was designed and incorporated into our vector system (Liu et al., 1998). Thus the final construction of large transfer plasmids can be achieved by Cre-loxP site-specific recombination between donor and acceptor. The co-expression of EGFP and tagRFP in the SmartBac system provides real-time visualization of transfection and expression. In addition, the SmartBac system provides a convenient workflow to screen the best tagged subunit for the subsequent optimal purification. Using SmartBac system, we have expressed various large multiprotein complexes, including the human exocyst complex and dynactin complex. We expect this system will aid structural and functional studies of large multiprotein complexes in the future.",

Briefly, this strategy uses Cre\u2013loxP site-specific recombination to catalyze fusion between the univector (donor) and host vector (acceptor). The kanamycin-resistant donor has a conditional R6K\u03b3 origin of replication that allows its propagation only in bacterial hosts expressing the pir gene, which encodes the essential replication protein \u03c0 (Filutowicz et al., 1985, Metcalf et al., 1994). Selection for the UPS recombination products is achieved by selecting for kanamycin resistance (KanR) after transformation into a pir- strain; the KanR gene in the donor vector can be expressed in a pir-background only when covalently linked to an acceptor that has a functional origin of replication (oriColE1) (Liu et al., 1998). This strategy has been successfully used in MultiBac system (Berger et al., 2004) and is advantageous for the preparation of large plasmids and their mutants due to the relatively small sizes of the donor and acceptor vectors.",

Spontaneous deletion of the foreign gene insertion may occur during the amplification of P2 virus (our unpublished data). In this case, we could switch to Scheme 2 (Fig. 2c).

Either tag can be fused to a target subunit and used to purify the whole complex by affinity chromatography. If there is enough prior knowledge of the structure of the complex, it is easy to determine the most suitable subunit to fuse with an affinity tag. However, when prior knowledge is limited, screening an appropriate subunit would be important because different affinity-tagged subunits would affect the effectiveness and successfulness of purifying the entire complex. Imagine that we are expressing an eight-subunit complex and are not sure which subunit is suitable for labeling a tag. If we use a classical \u201cTrial and Error\u201d approach and construct multiple large final transfer plasmids, the workload would be extremely high. To solve this issue, we propose a simple and universal scheme using SmartBac (Scheme 3, see Fig. 3\n). Two large final transfer plasmids ABCD and EFGH are built according to Scheme 2 (Fig. 2c) but where none of the eight subunits are labeled with affinity tags (Fig. 3a). An additional eight smaller transfer plasmids (from V1-TSA to V1-TSH) based on one acceptor (4V1G, 4V1R, 5V1TG or 5V1TR) are constructed, each containing one N-terminal Twin-Strep-tagged subunit. A total of ten recombinant baculoviruses are obtained, including BV-ABCD, BV-EFGH and BV-TSn (where n ranges from A to H) (Fig. 3b). The insect cells are co-infected with three baculoviruses, BV-ABCD, BV-EFGH and one type of BV-TSn. The baculovirus combinations used for screening are shown in Fig. 3c. After purification, we know affinity-tagged subunit H results in the best efficient purification of the entire complex. To increase yield and obtain a more homogenous sample, a new intermediate vector (EFG-TSH) containing tagged subunit H is built (Fig. 3d). The resulting new recombinant baculovirus, BV-EFG-TSH, together with the existing recombinant baculovirus, BV-ABCD, are eventually used to express the entire complex. And of course the efficiency of infection and expression can also be monitored in real time by observing the fluorescence signal of co-expressed EGFP and tagRFP.",

            "text": "To test the SmartBac system, we expressed the human exocyst complex in insect cells. The exocyst complex is responsible for tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane in preparation for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) mediated membrane fusion (Wu and Guo, 2015). The human exocyst complex contains eight evolutionary conserved subunits\u2014EXOC1 (102 kDa), EXOC2 (104 kDa), EXOC3 (86 kDa), EXOC4 (110 kDa), EXOC5 (82 kDa), EXOC6 (94 kDa), EXOC7 (78 kDa) and EXOC8 (82 kDa). Because the published literature does not provide information about which subunit is the most suitable for complex purification, we used Scheme 3 (Fig. 3) to screen the target subunits. All of the vectors we built for exocyst expression are shown in Table 1\n(see also Supplementary Materials and Methods S3). First, we constructed two types of recombinant baculoviruses, BV-E1547 (EXOC1, 5, 4, 7) and BV-E2863 (EXOC2, 8, 6, 3), to express the eight subunits without any tags according to Scheme 2 (Fig. 2c). These baculoviruses also expressed tagRFP and EGFP, respectively, which allowed us to conveniently determine whether virus infection and protein expression were successful (Fig. 4\na). We also produced eight additional types of recombinant baculoviruses, each expressing an individual subunit with an N-terminal Twin-Strep tag (BV-SE1 to BV-SE8). Then we co-infected insect cells with BV-E1547, BV-E2863 and a baculovirus expressing a single affinity tagged-subunit (BV-SE1 to BV-SE8). The best purification of the entire exocyst complex was achieved using BV-SE5 (Fig. 4b). Then we constructed a new donor vector 4V2-E1S5 that contains EXOC1 and N-terminal Twin Strep-tagged EXOC5. Recombination between 4V2-E1S5 and 5V1TR-E47 (containing EXOC4 and EXOC7) produced a new final transfer plasmid E1S547 (Table 1), from which recombinant baculovirus BV-E1S547 was obtained. Insect cells were co-infected with BV-E1S547 and BV-2863. After one-step strep-affinity purification, the entire exocyst complex with high purity was obtained (Fig. 4c). The tethering activity of this purified exocyst complex was determined via in vitro liposome tethering assay (to be published elsewhere). Negative-staining electron microscopy (nsEM) of the sample showed homogenous rod-like particles (Fig. 4d). Preliminary 2D classification of nsEM images (Fig. 4e) and 3D reconstruction (Fig. 4f) indicate that the human exocyst complex exhibits a similar dimension and shape with the extracted exocyst complex from yeast (Heider et al., 2016, Mei et al., 2018). The detailed information about primer design, molecular cloning, cell transfection, protein expression and purification, and electron microscopy is described in Materials and Methods.",

            "text": "We also reconstituted the human dynactin complex using the SmartBac system. Dynactin is a multiprotein complex that works with cytoplasmic dynein to transport cargo along microtubules. It is a large complex of approximately 1.2 MDa composed of 23 subunits corresponding to 11 different types of proteins (Reck-Peterson, 2015). Dynactin is built around a short actin-like filament composed of Arp1 (43 kDa, 8 copies) and \u03b2-actin (42 kDa, 1 copy). The barbed end and the pointed end of this filament are capped by the CapZ\u03b1-CapZ\u03b2 complex (33 kDa, 31 kDa) and the Arp11-p25-p27-p62 complex (46 kDa, 20 kDa, 21 kDa, and 52 kDa) respectively. The shoulder complex, which is made up of p50 (45 kDa, 4 copies), p24 (21 kDa, 2 copies) and p150/p135 (142 kDa/127 kDa, 2 copies), is positioned toward the barbed end of the Arp1 filament (Urnavicius et al., 2015). As shown in Table 2\n, three types of vectors were used to express the 11 subunits of the dynactin complex, and the N-terminal Twin-Strep tag on p135 was used to purify the whole complex. The shoulder complex proteins, p135, p50 and p24, were expressed by BV-M5, which was generated from the plasmid 5V1TG-M5. The final transfer plasmid AB was obtained through recombination of the acceptor 5V1TR-B and donor 4V2-A. Plasmid AB was then used to produce the recombinant baculovirus BV-AB expressing the other eight dynactin subunits. Insect cells were co-infected with BV-M5 and BV-AB to express the entire dynactin complex. After one-step strep-affinity purification, the dynactin complex was purified well with rational stoichiometry of its subunits (Fig. 4g). After glycerol density gradient ultracentrifugation, the further purified dynactin complex exhibited a single visible band on a native gel (Fig. 4h), suggesting a high homogeneity of the specimen. This recombinant human dynactin complex sample was further investigated by nsEM and subsequent 2D class classification (Fig. 4i), showing a rod-like particle with a shoulder at one end, which is consistent with the endogenous dynactin complex purified from pig brains (Urnavicius et al., 2015).",

The key to successful protein production using the baculovirus expression system is the construction of the final transfer plasmid containing genes of multiple protein subunits. The classical MultiBac system uses polycistronic vectors carrying multiple GECs for the expression of multiprotein complexes (Berger et al., 2004). This expression strategy requires first constructing the junior plasmids, each containing only one GEC. Then several rounds of plasmid construction are needed to obtain multi-GEC donor and acceptor vectors. The final transfer plasmid carrying all GECs is produced by Cre-LoxP recombination. MultiBac has been proven powerful in generating multiprotein complexes (Berger et al., 2013, Vijayachandran et al., 2011), especially when robotic support is available. But in ordinary laboratories without robotics, the first two procedures require a lot of labor and time. And as more GECs are added to a single vector, the difficulty of plasmid construction increases, which is due to the increasing size of the plasmid and the lack of an efficient screening method for large positive recombinants.",

This system uses computationally optimized DNA linker for efficient Gibson assembly reactions to assemble multiple GECs. Although the junior plasmids pLIBs, each containing only one GEC, still need to be constructed first, the final transfer plasmid containing multiple GECs can be assembled by two rounds of Gibson assembly reactions. In the first round, the pBIG1 vectors each containing up to 5 GECs are produced. Then the pBIG2 vectors containing more GECs can be assembled from pBIG1 vectors during the second round. The biGBac system does not depend on combining \u201cdonor\u201d and \u201cacceptor\u201d vectors; as a result any biGBac construct can be used for the generation of baculoviruses. This system has been successfully applied to express the human anaphase promoting complex APC/C that contains 17 different subunits with a total molecular weight of 1.2 MDa (Weissmann et al., 2016). However, the efficiency of Gibson assembly would decrease when the number and length of assembled DNA fragments increase. Even using the computationally optimized DNA linker, the averaged efficiency of producing pBIG1 constructs from the pLIBs was less than 22% (42/196) (Weissmann et al., 2016). In addition, because all cDNAs are cloned into pLIB vectors, all GECs contain the same promoter and terminator. This would produce a large accumulation of repeating sequences in the final pBIG2 vector. Whether these repeating sequences would increase the possibility of unpredicted recombination and gene loss should be presumably considered.",

We mimicked the polyprotein production strategy to realize the expression of multiple subunits (Table 3\n). Although this strategy has already been discussed and applied (Bieniossek et al., 2012, Chen et al., 2010, Nie et al., 2014), a specialized vector system and standardized procedures are not available. In SmartBac system, long DNA sequences encoding polyproteins are produced by overlapping PCR and Gibson assembly. There is no need to construct junior vectors in comparison with MultiBac and biGBac (Table 3). To ensure high assembly efficiency, we usually use three DNA fragments for Gibson reactions. The acceptor and donor vectors support blue-white screening, which increases the selection efficiency of positive clones. The final transfer plasmid produced by Cre-LoxP recombination is pre-designed to a size of less than 25 kb, which allows an efficient chemical transformation in the subsequent procedure. To increase the stability of the large final transfer plasmid propagated in E. coli, we introduced a low-copy p15A replication origin into the acceptor vectors and cultured the bacteria at 30 \u00b0C.",

In our experiment, we found the polyprotein strategy would yield a more homogenous expression of human COPI complex (Wang et al., 2016). In other cases, the subunits may have different copies. For example, in human dynactin complex, the copy number ratio of subunits p135 (or p150):p50:p24 is 2:4:2. To ensure a correct subunit stoichiometry, we designed a polyprotein expressing 1 copy of p135, 2 copies of p50 and 1 copy of p24. If the number of one subunit is much higher than the other subunits, we will use a stronger promoter (e.g. the polyhedrin promoter) to express this subunit independently.",

            "text": "The design of polyprotein is very important. In our experience, besides the length of the final DNA, the order of subunits in the polyprotein should also be considered. This order will affect the amino acid sequences of the C-terminus or N-terminus of these subunits. The polyprotein strategy puts a TEV recognition site (ENLYFQS) between adjacent subunits. In vivo TEV processing of the polyprotein leads to the production of mature subunits, which will yield one additional serine at the N-terminus and/or a six amino acid peptide ENLYFQ at the C-terminus for each subunit. If the N-terminus or the C-terminus of one subunit is vital to the assembly of the final complex, these extra amino acids would adversely affect the success of the complex assembly. Under these circumstances, the location of this specific subunit in the polyprotein should be considered carefully. Expressing this subunit in an individual GEC is another good option. In human dynactin complex, the C-terminus of Arp1 is very important to the assembly of actin-like filament, thus we expressed it using a single GEC so that no extra amino acids exist in its C-terminus.",

The final transfer plasmids, ABCD (RFP) and EFGH (GFP), are generated using Scheme 2, and each will express four protein subunits without affinity labels. Each of the other eight transfer plasmids will express one subunit with an N-terminal Twin-Strep (TS) tag. Either the 4V1 or 5V1 vector can be used here. (b) Production of ten types of recombinant baculoviruses (RBVs). Transformation of the ten types of plasmids into DH10Bac competent cells generates 10 types of RBVs. (c) Screening baculovirus combinations to find the subunit that results in the best purification. The ten types of RBVs are divided into eight groups, and each group contains BV-ABCD (RFP), BV-EFGH (GFP) and one BV-TSn (where n corresponds to the subunit, A to H). Insect cells are co-infected with eight groups of RBVs and strep-affinity resin is used to pull down proteins bound to the TS-tagged subunit. The tagged subunit that allows the best purification of the whole complex is selected. In this example, subunit H is the best. (d) Production of the multiprotein complex. Based on the screening result in (c), a new final transfer plasmid EFG-TSH (GFP) is constructed, which expresses an N-terminal TS-tagged subunit H. The whole protein complex will be purified from insect cells co-infected with BV-ABCD (RFP) and BV-EFG-TSH (GFP).",
