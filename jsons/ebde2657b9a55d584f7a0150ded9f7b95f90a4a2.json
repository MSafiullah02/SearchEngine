They are also likely avoiding care due to the new Public Charge rule, which negatively weighs the use of public assistance, such as nutrition assistance, non-emergency Medicaid, and housing benefits, against any applicant for permanent residence and their dependents. 16 Though the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced suspension of the public charge rule related to COVID-19 care, widespread fear amongst immigrant communities will likely lead to fewer seeking care.

Federal law defines an emergency medical condition as \"a medical condition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in -(A) placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy; (B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or (C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part (Social Security Act 1903 \u00a7(v)(3)).\" There is no stipulation that emergency medical conditions have to be treated in the inpatient setting, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services defers to states to determine what conditions qualify as emergencies. As an example, Arizona's Medicaid Policy Manual clearly defines outpatient dialysis as services that are covered by Emergency Medicaid. Undocumented immigrants receive scheduled outpatient dialysis as long as the treating provider signs a monthly certification stating that the absence of thrice-weekly dialysis would place the individual's health in serious jeopardy.Inclusion of outpatient dialysis in the state's definition of an emergency medical condition allows the same funds to cover outpatient dialysis instead of inpatient admissions for emergencyonly dialysis.4",

If admitted, undocumented immigrants are eligible for coverage via Emergency Medicaid, though hospital discharge may be delayed as Emergency Medicaid does not cover services following hospital discharge such as oxygen, telehealth, primary care, or rehabilitation.14 The symptoms emergency-only dialysis patients experience when they need treatment might be confused for symptoms of COVID-19. Severe shortness of breath from volume overload, malaise and nausea, might prompt emergency department clinicians to unnecessarily test for COVID-19 when tests are still limited. Each admission for dialysis unnecessarily utilizes inpatient beds, dialysis supplies, and nursing resources that could be otherwise used for patients with COVID-19. This is especially problematic in communities facing a COVID-19 surge, where nephrologists are making decisions about altering dialysis treatments to meet the needs of greater numbers of patients.15",
