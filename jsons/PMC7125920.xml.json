            "text": "Infectious viruses, such as HIV, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and so on, have a great threat to human health and life and brought devastating effects on social and economic development [[1], [2], [3]]. Among them, influenza A virus has become one of the most prevalent infectious diseases and caused highly infectious respiratory illness [4], which are estimated to result in about 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness, and about 290 000\u2013650 000 respiratory deaths [5]. Influenza A subtypes are classified by the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins expressed on the surface of virus particles. To date, 15 antigenic subtypes of HA and 9 antigenic subtypes of NA are discovered throughout the world [6]. HA is the major viral surface antigen and plays in an important role in virus invasion and propagation with the interaction between glycans on the host cell, which causes influenza virus rapidly spreading infection throughout the world [7,8]. Influenza virus with H7 and H9 HA subtypes can cause human-to-human, human-to-animal transmissions [9,10]. These kinds of transmissions make the point-of-care detection and operator protection very important [[11], [12], [13]]. Therefore, simultaneous and automated detection of multiple influenza HA subtypes are needed for the diagnosis and treatment.",

            "text": "In recent years, many magnetic-based sensitive assays have been developed for influenza A detection, due to the unique properties of magnetic materials like high surface-to-volume, easy modification, convenient manipulation [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Nowadays, most of magnetic-based assays are limited by large samples, low level of automation and time-consuming process. Moreover, it is difficult to simultaneously use different-size magnetic beads (from nanometers to micrometers) in biological applications due to their similar magnetic magnitudes. Microfluidic technology has many unique advantages over conventional analytical techniques, which could reduce sample and reagent consumption, high throughout, miniaturization, multiple physical field manipulation, and the potentiality of automation [22]. Thus, many efforts have been devoted to the development of magnetic-based assays on microfluidic chips [4,[23], [24], [25], [26]]. However, these assays on microfluidic chips usually need fabrication methods like soft lithography, fine magnetic field manipulation, and single-size magnetic bead. Therefore, new methods that can overcome this problem are urgently needed for the simultaneous and automated detection of multiple influenza HA subtypes on the microfluidic chip.",

On this previous basis, a magnetism and size mediated multiphysics field microfluidic chip was constructed for simultaneous and automated detection of multiple influenza HA (Scheme 1\n). The unique advantages of our proposed strategy can be listed as follows: First, assisted by multiplex microvalves and computer program, the detection process showed high automation which was helpful to protect the operator from virus infection. Second, multiple physical fields, which consisted of magnetism mediated magnetophoretic separation and size mediated signal detection, enhanced the complex sample treatment ability and realized the multiple influenza HA subtypes simultaneous detection only by different-size magnetic beads. Third, using high-luminance quantum dots as reporter enhanced the detection sensitivity. This method can quantitatively detect H7N9 and H9N2 HA with a detection limit of 3.4 ng/mL and 4.5 ng/mL, respectively. In addition, the assay was robust, and had showed high specificity, anti-interference ability and good reproducibility. In this way, this method opens up new avenues for virus subtypes analysis and expands the simultaneous application of different-size magnetic beads on the microfluidic chip.",

The etching rate was related to the concentration of reagents, humidity and temperature, so the rate should be calculated before the microchannel etching according to CNC computer engraving machine measurements. During etching, the protective film on the glass was orderly removed to obtain the different microchannel heights. After chemical etching, the chip should be quickly rinsed in ultrapure water to prevent the etched glass slag from condensing. Second, the etching microchannel further processed to generate the inlets and outlets via CNC computer engraving machine. Then glasses was immersed in a solution of sulfuric acid for 2 h to make the glass surface hydrophilic, which is favorable for bonding.

Among them, different detection reagents were stored and controlled by multiplex microvalves with a computer program, which greatly reduced the contact with the high-risk influenza HA (Fig. 2A). The multiplex microvalves were established by inserting a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane into two glasses, which are cheap and simple without any complex silicon-based device or soft lithography. The detailed fabrication and characterization of multiplex valves were reported in our previous work [35]. After the magnetic-based immunoassay with multiplex microvalves controlling, IMBs-tagged influenza HA was flowed into the microchannel of separation zone at a rate of 5 \u03bcL/min. With the function of magnetization, IMBs-tagged HA were been immunomagnetic separation in the lateral direction of the microchannel. A uniform magnetic field gradient was applied to the microchannel of separation zone to contribute the immunomagnetic separation (Fig. 2B). The detailed magnetic field analysis, assisted by finite element calculation, was described in supporting information section S.1. The effectiveness of separation was observed by the microscopic image (Fig. 2C), and further tracked by the fluorescent labeled microspheres and recorded in a movie attached as a supporting information. In the movie, different-size magnetic beads captured in the different size mediated zones were clearly observed. After immunomagnetic separation, the IMBs-tagged complex was trapped in corresponding detection zone based on different-size magnetic beads (Fig. 2D), and further reacted with biotinylated antibody and SA-QDs to generate immune-sandwich complexes, obtaining the detection signal. The velocity of flow was optimized. As shown in the Fig. S3, the fluorescence intensity reached a maximum when the flow of biotinylated antibodies was 5 \u03bcL/min, therefore, 5 \u03bcL/min was the best flow rate. Fig. 2E showed the whole detection platform, making the detection with a high automation.",

            "text": "In summary, an automated magnetic-based immune assay for multiple influenza HA was established on the magnetism and size mediated microfluidic chip. The automated detection process could reduce the contact of high-risk viruses, protecting the operator. Coupled with magnetism and size mediated multiple physical field design, multiple influenza HA subtypes were detected simultaneously only by different-size magnetic beads. Finally, H7N9 HA could be detected in concentrations as low as 3.4 ng/mL, and H9N2 HA could be detected for 4.5 ng/mL. In addition, the assay exhibited high specificity, anti-interference ability and good reproducibility. In this way, we believe that this method may open up new avenues for simultaneous using different-size magnetic beads to detect multiple pathogens subtypes.",
