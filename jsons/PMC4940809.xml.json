However, as every halogen gas, it is toxic both to environment and to humans. As a consequence, the Montreal agreements have forbidden its use since 1987. Unfortunately in many countries, especially developing countries, this gas is still used. Thirty-eight cases of methyl bromide poisoning were reported in the literature. CH3Br poisoning is usually accidental, and related to chronic, or acute exposure. We present here a case report of acute accidental methyl bromide poisoning, responsible for a severe multiple organ failure (MOF).",

The diagnosis was made based on the combination of an elevated troponin up to 54 \u03bcg/L and changes in the 12-lead electrocardiogram. There was indeed a de novo ST elevation and a Pardee wave in the inferolateral territory, with mirror images in the anterior territory. The transthoracic echocardiography revealed kinetics abnormalities in the corresponding territories and a decreased left ventricle ejection fraction at 30%. The patient also presented ventricular fibrillation, reversed after three external electric shocks. Given the fact that the patient was highly unstable, presented acute renal failure, and in the hypothesis of a septic shock, we decided not to perform an angiocoronarography immediately. The cardiogenic shock was controlled after 4 days of cardiotropic treatment by dobutamine, and the electrocardiogram was back to anterior state within 48 h, under cover of a treatment by double platelet anti-aggregation. One month later, the LVEF increased at 50%.",

The assumption of a myocardial infarction induced by the methyl bromide himself was then not confirmed. The major etiological hypothesis for this cardiac and/or coronary distress is a side effect of the severe initial shock with low cardiac output. Indeed, initial cardiac ultrasound showed localized kinetics abnormality, well correlated with electrocardiogram, which did not suggest a stress cardiomyopathy such as Takotsubo (no contrast between apex and basis of the left ventricle). A direct cardiotoxicity of the methyl bromide is quite unlikely because no similar case has been described in the literature.",

We used a continuous venovenous hemofiltration instead of intermittent dialysis because of hemodynamic unstability. A normal renal function was finally reached in 16 days, with a creatininemia at 90 \u03bcmol/L, and a normal urinary output. This renal failure seems to be of renal type. On the first blood sample from the emergency ward, creatinine level is already more increased than the urea is. The natriuresis was never locked. Moreover, the early volemic expansion and hemodynamic stabilization had no effect on renal function and diuresis. This renal failure can easily be explained by the methyl bromide himself [9].",

Two days later, in spite of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment (Tazocilline), it progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 80 and bilateral diffuse alveolar syndrome on the chest X-ray. There was no argument in favor of a cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, in spite of the concomitant ventricular dysfunction, because the left ventricular filling pressures were low. The patient required specific ARDS ventilation and curarization. Finally, ARDS quickly resolved, and the patient did not require prone positioning. The pulmonary evolution was also marked by the occurrence at day 8 of a pneumothorax under mechanical ventilation, which had to be been drained by a chest tube.",

It was certainly favored by 56 days of mechanical ventilation and the severity of the multiple organ failure [10]. However, this kind of peripheral neuropathy has also been frequently described in cases of methyl bromide poisoning [11-14]. On top of this, the methyl bromide intoxication resulted in central neurological effects, such as delayed awakening, and alertness disorders. Moreover, the patient experienced swallowing disorders, probably due to the methyl bromide intoxication itself [3,15]. A percutaneous tracheotomy was performed because of weaning difficulties.",

            "text": "As far as pathophysiology is concerned, several mechanisms seem to be the cause of the methyl bromide toxicity. Most of the authors have described a cellular toxic effect. Indeed, following a methylation reaction, the methyl bromide conjugates itself with glutathione to make methylglutathione, which is highly toxic for the respiratory chain [17-20]. A second cause often described is the modulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor within the cerebellar and vestibular systems [9,16,21]. A third hypothesis attributes toxicity to methyl bromide metabolites such as methanethiol and formaldehyde [17,19]. Another suggested mechanism is that methyl bromide rapidly inhibits creatine kinase activity in all regions of the brain and in other target organs. Creatine kinase is an enzyme catalyzing the conversion of adenosine triphosphate and creatine to adenosine diphosphate and phosphocreatine [22,23].",
