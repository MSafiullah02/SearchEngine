            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a highly\u2010contagious and deadly enteric swine coronavirus and is considered an emerging and re\u2010emerging viral pathogen that is a financial threat to the global pork industry (Lee, 2015, 2019; Stevenson et al., 2013; Weng, Weersink, Poljak, de Lange, & von Massow, 2016). PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (Gorbalenya, Enjuanes, Ziebuhr, & Snijder, 2006; Saif, Pensaert, Sestack, Yeo, & Jung, 2012). The PEDV genome is approximately 28\u2010kb long with a 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail and is composed of a 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region (UTR), at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) designated ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORFs 2 through 6 and a 3\u2032\u2010UTR. The first two large ORFs, ORF1a and 1b, encode replicase polyproteins that undergo autoproteolysis by viral proteases to eventually produce 16 processing non\u2010structural proteins (nsp1\u201316). The remaining ORFs encode four canonical coronavirus structural proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as a single accessory gene, ORF3 (Lee, 2015, 2019).",

            "text": "Since its emergence in South Korea in 1992, small\u2010 to large\u2010scale PEDV epizootics have occurred annually throughout the nation, leading to substantial economic losses in domestic pig production (Lee, 2015, 2019). The 2013 PED pandemic that ravaged the United States (Stevenson et al., 2013) also struck the Korean Peninsula and decimated more than 40% of the pig farms across the country during 2013\u20132014 (Lee, 2015, 2019; Lee et al., 2014; Lee & Lee, 2014). Subsequently, in late March 2014, the virus invaded Jeju Island located 80 km from the South Korea mainland at the closest point, which had maintained PEDV\u2010na\u00efve status for a decade, causing massive neonatal mortality in provincial herds. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the re\u2010emergent Jeju Island PEDV isolates were most closely related to the pandemic genogroup 2b (G2b) strains that were responsible for the 2013\u20132014 global outbreaks, suggesting a direct introduction of the virus from the mainland of South Korea via unknown contaminating sources (Lee et al., 2014). Even with province\u2010wide vaccination or intentional virus\u2010exposure practices being implemented in order to provide herd immunity around the areas that contain dense swine populations, PEDV has continued to plague the provincial pork industry. Since several pig farms have experienced recurrent PEDV outbreaks within a single year, PED has become endemic on Jeju Island (Lee et al., 2014; Lee & Lee, 2017). In this study, we determined the complete genome sequences of field isolates on Jeju Island to investigate the diversity of the PEDVs responsible for the ongoing endemic outbreaks. Additionally, we isolated and serially cultured a novel PEDV strain, KOR/KNU\u20101807/2018, in cell culture and investigated its genotypic and phenotypic characteristics in vitro and in vivo.",

Small intestine (SI) specimens were collected at 18 different pig farms located in those districts from January through June 2018 from dead piglets that had acute diarrhoea. Intestinal homogenates were prepared as 10% (wt/vol) suspensions in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) using a MagNA Lyser Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with three rounds of 15 s at a force of 8,000 g. The suspensions were then vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4,500 g (Hanil Centrifuge FLETA5, Incheon, South Korea). The clarified supernatants were initially subjected to RT\u2010PCR analysis using an i\u2010TGE/PED Detection Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Animals were fed commercial milk replacer (3\u20134 times daily) and had ad libitum access to water for the 5\u2010day duration of the study. Following a 2\u2010day acclimation period, piglets (5\u2010day old) in the virus\u2010inoculated groups received an oral 1\u2010ml dose of 103.0 TCID50/ml of the appropriate virus, which was equivalent to 100 median pig diarrhoea dose PDD50 of KNU\u2010141112 (Baek et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2015, 2017).

A PEDV isolate with a known infectivity titre was 10\u2010fold serially diluted to generate a standard curve in each PCR plate. The virus concentrations (TCID50/ml) in the samples were calculated based on the standard curve. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated for the PCR\u2010positive samples and the mean virus titres were calculated for all pigs within the group. A clinical significance score (CSS) was determined using the following scoring criteria for diarrhoeal severity based on visual examination for 5 days post\u2010inoculation (dpi): 0, normal with no diarrhoea (mean Ct values > 45); 1, mild with fluidic faeces; 2, moderate mucus to watery diarrhoea; 3, severe watery and projectile diarrhoea (mean Ct values < 20); 4, death.

Moreover, the Jeju Island strains from 2018 also demonstrated 96.7%\u201398.7% aa identity with the global G2b PEDVs reported previously in Jeju Island, mainland South Korea, and the US, but only 91.3%\u201392.5% and 94.0%\u201394.7% aa homology with the classical G1a or variant G1b strains respectively (Table 1). Compared to the 2014 re\u2010emergent Jeju strain KNU\u20101409, the 2018 Jeju viruses contained a total of 19\u201326 aa mutations in the S gene (Figure 1a). Remarkably, more than half of these variations were identified only in the 2018 Jeju Island strains (black lines). In particular, KNU\u20101806, \u20101807, \u20101815, \u20101816 and \u20101818 each possessed their own unique mutations that did not exist in other domestic strains (black arrow lines) compared. In total, the genetic data indicated that the 2018 Jeju isolates were still most closely related to the G2b pandemic strains but that they continued to independently evolve through the process of genetic drift.",

Among those, whole genomes of only three strains consisted of 28,038 nt (excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail), which was the genome size of most G2b field viruses. However, the genome of KNU\u20101816 was longer with 28,050 nt, while the genome sequences of KNU\u20101807, \u20101815, and \u20101818 were each shorter and 28,017, 28,029 and 28,035 nt respectively. The longer genome of KNU\u20101816 was ascribed to a 4\u2010aa insertion in the S protein as described above, whereas the shorter genome sizes of KNU\u20101807 and \u20101815 resulted from unique 21\u2010nt (7\u2010aa) or 9\u2010nt (3\u2010aa) deletion (DEL) at genomic positions 3,324\u20133,344 or 3,408\u20133,416 located in ORF1a encoding nsp3, respectively (Figure 1b), which serves as a papain\u2010like protease (PLpro).

The remaining strain KNU\u20101818 possessed a 3\u2010nt (1\u2010aa) DEL at genomic positions 10,575\u201310,577 in ORF1a encoding nsp6.

In infected Vero cells from passage 4 (P4), KNU\u20101807 produced obvious CPE typical of PEDV infection, such as cell fusion, syncytium formation and cell detachment. Increased syncytia size became more distinct at the 5th passage (P5). Virus propagation was confirmed by the detection of PEDV antigens with IFA using a PEDV N\u2010specific MAb. The apparent staining was localized in the cytoplasm of syncytial cells. In contrast, neither CPE nor N\u2010specific staining was evident in mock\u2010inoculated Vero cells. Examples of CPE and corresponding IFA images from selected passages are shown in Figure 3a. The amount of viral genome in each of the selected passages was further evaluated and the mean Ct value was determined to be 15.07 with a range from 13.52 (P10) to 16.63 (P5). The infectious titre of the isolate was 105.5 TCID50/ml at P5 and approximately 107 TCID50/ml at the later passages. Analysis of growth kinetics further demonstrated that KNU\u20101807 replicated rapidly and efficiently in Vero cells, reaching a titre >106 TCID50/ml by 12 hpi (Figure 3b).",

A unique 7\u2010aa DEL in nsp3 identified in the original isolate was stable upon serial passages in cell culture. The S sequence analysis of the P4 isolate of KNU\u20101807 (KNU\u20101807\u2010P4) compared to the original KNU\u20101807\u2010SI sample revealed that KNU\u20101807\u2010P4 acquired 3\u2010nt substitutions that resulted in two non\u2010synonymous changes (Phe to Leu and Lys to Arg) at aa positions 501 and 614 respectively.

Thus, the pathogenicity of the KNU\u20101807\u2010S C\u2010DEL9 virus (KNU\u20101807\u2010P10) compared to that of the virulent G2b strain was evaluated by experimental infection of newborn piglets. Nine piglets divided into three groups of three or four animals each were challenged orally with KNU\u2010141112\u2010P5 (group 1) or KNU\u20101807\u2010P10 (group 2) and the remaining two piglets in a control group were inoculated with cell culture medium. Clinical signs were recorded three times daily and faecal swabs were collected prior to inoculation and daily after inoculation for the duration of the study. During the acclimation period, all piglets were active, showed no clinical symptoms and had normal faecal consistency, and their faecal samples were negative for PEDV RNA. Following viral challenge, none of the negative\u2010control piglets developed clinical signs. In contrast, all KNU\u2010141112\u2010P5\u2010challenged piglets (group 1) exhibited clinical signs, including lethargy, anorexia, and diarrhoeic faeces by 24 hpi (mean CSS = 1.66) and experienced severe watery diarrhoea with vomiting thereafter (mean CSS > 3.0) (Figure 5a). PEDV\u2010associated mortality occurred in two of the animals in group 1 at 88 hpi. Although the onset of clinical sings was 1\u2010day delayed in the S C\u2010DEL 9 virus\u2010inoculated animals in group 2, they eventually developed PEDV\u2010specific clinical symptoms from 32 or 40 hpi (mean CSS = 3). Only one animal in group 2 died from PEDV at 88 hpi, whereas the three remaining piglets experienced less severe watery diarrhoea from 96 dpi onward and remained alive until the termination of the study (Figure 5a). All the piglets in group 1 were tested positive for PEDV by RT\u2010PCR at 1 dpi with a mean Ct value of 25.3 (equivalent to 102.23 TCID50/ml) and they shed dramatically elevated levels of PEDV in their faeces starting at 2 dpi with Ct values ranging from 15.3\u201317.0 (105.8\u2013106.3 TCID50/ml) (Figure 5b). In contrast, PEDV faecal shedding in all piglets in group 2 was recorded by 2 dpi with a mean Ct value of 18.5 (105.4 TCID50/ml), which was maintained at similar levels through 5 dpi. Overall, a late onset and significant decline in quantities of faecal shedding for the first 2 days post\u2010inoculation were observed in the animals of group 2 relative to those in the animals of group 1. Negative\u2010control pigs remained healthy with normal faeces and no detectable PEDV shedding in faeces throughout the duration of the experiment.",

All animals challenged with a virulent KNU\u2010141112\u2010P5 strain macroscopically displayed archetypal PED\u2010like gross lesions. Their small intestines were distended with the accumulation of a yellowish watery content and presented with thin transparent intestinal walls as a result of villous atrophy (Figure 6a). Microscopic assessment showed that the small intestines from all piglets in group 1 were characterized by acute viral enteritis with a shortening and fusion of the small intestine villi and vacuolation of the superficial epithelial cells (Figure 6g). IHC staining detected PEDV antigen predominant in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in atrophied villi in all segments of the small intestines (Figure 6m). Analogously, both dead and surviving animals infected with KNU\u20101807 in group 2 during the experimental period exhibited remarkable visible pathological intestinal lesions (Figure 6b\u2013e), typical histopathological features of viral enteritis with villous atrophy (Figure 6h\u2013k) and the presence of viral antigen (Figure 6n\u2013q), comparable to those in group 1.

Compared to the 2013\u20132014 Korean and Jeju re\u2010emergent G2b strains, the 2018 Jeju Island isolates contained 19\u201326\u2010aa changes in the S glycoprotein, which were randomly and broadly distributed throughout the S1 and S2 domains. Interestingly, among those, a number of mutations in the 2018 Jeju Island strains were absent in the field strains responsible for the regional outbreaks in mainland South Korea during 2017\u20132018 (Figure 1a) (Lee & Lee, 2018). Furthermore, a large 7\u2010aa or small 3\u2010aa DEL was found within the nsp3 of several Jeju strains, which was similarly reported in the epidemic isolates identified in mainland South Korea in late 2017; however, these DELs were 6\u2010aa or 10\u2010aa shorter than the nsp3\u2010DEL of the recent mainland strain KNU\u20101705 respectively (Figure 1b) (Lee & Lee, 2018). The phylogeny further revealed that the Jeju epidemic and endemic strains reported since 2014 comprised their own clade within the G2b subgroup. Thus, genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the re\u2010emergent G2b Jeju strains persistently underwent independent evolution on Jeju Island since 2014 (Figure S2) and has become endemic within the provincial pork industry.",

            "text": "Similar to other coronavirus replicase\u2010encoded nsps, many PEDV nsps (nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, nsp7, nsp14, nsp15 and nsp16) function as interferon (IFN) antagonists that modulate the innate immune response (Wang et al., 2016; Zhang, Shi, & Yoo, 2016). Along with variations extensively dispersed throughout the S gene, it would be interesting to identify mutations in these nsp genes, including INDELs that possibly contribute to the pathogenesis of PEDV. A majority of the non\u2010silent point mutations, which appeared to have resulted from their continuous accumulation in the field over the past 3\u20134 years, occurred in the ORF1ab region encoding 16 nsps, particularly in nsp3. These 29\u201341 variations seem to be significant since the cell culture\u2010attenuated G2b strain contained only 4\u2010aa changes over 100 serial passages when compared to the virulent parental strain (Lee et al., 2017). Although no INDELs arose in the attenuated G2b virus S DEL5/ORF3 (Lee et al., 2017), the attenuated G1a\u2010derived vaccine strains possess an 8\u2010aa DEL in nsp3, which overlaps or is located 12 or 18 aa downstream of those found in the recent G2b field strains, implicating the potential involvement of the nsp3 DEL in attenuation (Figure 1b). Although nsp3 critically acts as a PLpro that post\u2010transcriptionally cleaves replicase polyproteins into functional nsps, the DELs present in the Glu\u2010rich acidic region of nsp3 have no effect on its own roles and therefore are dispensable for the replication of coronaviruses, including PEDV (Lee & Lee, 2018; Lei, Kusov, & Hilgenfeld, 2018). Consistent with our previous study (Lee & Lee, 2018), this tolerance for the nsp3 DEL during PEDV replication was reproduced in the current study as shown in Figure 3. Considering the genetic traits of nsp3, including homologous or heterologous DEL mutations, in addition with the heterogeneity of S genes, the nsp3 DEL pattern may be useful for investigating genetic relatedness and the molecular epidemiology of PEDV. In particular, the three isolates KNU\u20101815, \u20101820 and \u20101821, which were temporally and independently identified from three adjacent farms and shared 99.3%\u2013100% identity with each other at the S gene level, were found to contain a homologous 3\u2010aa DEL in nsp3, consistent with a typical farm\u2010to\u2010farm transmission of PEDV via lax biosecurity.",

            "text": "In addition to genetic drift under field conditions, an outstanding DEL in the cytosolic endodomain of S was identified in the novel nsp3\u2010DEL PEDV KNU\u20101807 isolate since the first productive passage in cell culture (P4) and subsequently retained, thereby resulting in a 9\u2010aa DEL at the end of the KNU\u20101807\u2010P4 S protein. Like other coronaviruses, the PEDV S glycoprotein can be functionally divided into two subdomains, S1 responsible for binding to cell receptor(s) and S2 involved in direct fusion between the viral and cellular membranes (Lee, 2015). The last 5\u2010aa (KVHVQ) of the cytoplasmic tail of S is known to be a potential ER retrieval signal with its KxHxx motif and loss of this motif increases cell fusion activity by defecting the ER retention of S protein and promoting their transport to the cell surface (Lee et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Shirato et al., 2011). Since KNU\u20101807\u2010P4 exhibited a premature termination of the S protein by 9\u2010aa residues (EVFEKVHVQ) that included the ER retrieval motif, it would be anticipated that this strain would demonstrate increased fusion activity in vitro. Our data revealed that the KNU\u20101807 strain produced significantly larger syncytia in infected cells compared to those observed in cells inoculated with PEDV containing an intact cytosolic domain of S (Figure 3a) (Lee et al., 2015). Similar DEL mutations at the end of S protein have been reported for the Korean G1a vaccine strain SM98\u20101 and cell culture\u2010attenuated G2b strains KNU\u2010141112\u2010P80 (80\u2010passage virus) and PC22A\u2010P120 (120\u2010passage virus) during in vitro serial passages (Lee et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017). SM98\u20101 and KNU\u2010141112\u2010P80 have a large 52\u2010nt or 46\u2010nt DEL in the intergenic portion of S and ORF3, leading to the premature termination of S by 7\u2010aa (FEKVHVQ) and 5\u2010aa (KVHVQ) residues, respectively; whereas PC22A\u2010P120 has a single nt substitution of GAA to TAA at positions 4,129\u20134,131 in the S gene, resulting in a stop codon and a 9\u2010aa (EVFEKVHVQ) DEL. The S C\u2010DEL9 identified in this study differed from aforementioned strains in that the early termination was caused by a combination of a novel nt DEL and a \u22121 frameshift event that occurred in the most primitive cell culture passage P4. It is possible that the S DEL naturally emerged during the initial culturing in the Vero cell via an unknown mechanism. Indeed, the occurrence of a large 197\u2010aa S DEL in the N\u2010terminus of the S protein that was absent in the original sample has been reported during the first cell culture passage of the US G2b PC177 strain (Oka et al., 2014). We were consistently unable to detect the same S C\u2010DEL9 in the original KNU\u20101807\u2010SI sample by deep genome sequencing (data not shown). However, since coronaviruses are known to innately exist as quasispecies or as mixed populations of several strains (Zhang et al., 2007), we cannot exclude the possibility that this variant was initially present as a minor proportion in the clinical sample and was able to replicate more competently in cell culture instead of the emergence of the extraordinarily DEL during the earliest stages of cell adaption. Similarly, a Chinese field G2b strain, FL2013, that naturally contains a unique 21\u2010nt DEL in the extreme C\u2010terminus of its S protein, leading to a 7\u2010aa (FEKVHVQ) S C\u2010DEL pattern, has been found to have reduced virulence to newborn piglets (Zhang et al., 2015). Thus, it is important to further surveil whether S C\u2010DEL variant strains naturally circulate in Korean pig populations.",

            "text": "Since a growing body of evidence proposes the early termination of the S protein and the extinction of its ER retention signal as being a marker for PEDV attenuation, we investigated whether the virulence of the KNU\u20101807 virus would be markedly less than that previously reported for PEDV pathogenesis. Our data revealed that despite similarities of macroscopic and microscopic small intestine lesions, the KNU\u20101807 virus possessed weakened pathogenicity in experimentally inoculated piglets compared to the virulent KNU\u2010141112 strain in terms of disease severity of clinical presentation, including the mortality rate and onset of virus shedding, indicating the involvement of the extreme C\u2010terminal region of the S protein in virulence. However, we were unable to observe a fully attenuated phenotypes for KNU\u20101807 in inoculated animals compared with those seen in our previous study (Lee et al., 2017). This suggested that DEL mutations in several parts of the S protein (N\u2010terminal and C\u2010terminal regions) and/or accessory ORF3 and/or nsp3 may affect the virulence of PEDV. Because comparative analysis of paired virulent/attenuated strains revealed no conserved patterns of attenuation\u2010related genetic variations, it is less likely that point mutations throughout the genome significantly contribute to the change in virulence. Collectively, it is plausible that the complete attenuation of PEDV requires a combination of multiple genetic changes (mainly DELs) and that it consequently occurs as the result of simultaneous modification of multiple molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in pathogenesis. These aspects can be further assessed by using reverse genetics technology.",

            "text": "In conclusion, PEDV continues to endemically affect pig farms on Jeju Island, giving rise to moderate\u2010to\u2010severe clinical disease associated with PED in infected piglets. However, the loss of neonates to death varies among litters and between farms and is less than that reported for severe G2b epidemics, which approach 100% mortality in newborn piglets. This mild\u2010to\u2010moderate outbreak scenario seen on Jeju Island may be due to herd immunity developed from vaccination and intentional infection since the re\u2010emergence of PEDV in the area. Another possibility is that genetic variation and/or DEL in nsps and S protein have arisen under field circumstances leading to the evasion of host immune defenses, such as IFN and neutralizing antibodies, and consequently alter viral pathogenicity, leading to endemic and low\u2010pathogenic outbreaks in the field. Thus, cutting\u2010edge research using reverse genetics will be necessary to provide fundamental insights into the specific role of nsp and S gene mutations in PEDV pathogenesis. More importantly, the current study confirmed that the contemporary field G2b isolates have nearly 4% amino acid sequence divergence in the S protein compared to the 2013\u20132014 domestic G2b strains. This mutation rate is approximately twice as high as that in recent mainland strains of PEDV (Lee & Lee, 2018). Furthermore, the evolutionary rate estimated for the S gene of PEDV G2b Jeju Island strains was 14.80 \u00d7 10\u20134 substitutions/site/year, whereas that for the G2b mainland strains was 7.18 \u00d7 10\u20134 substitutions/site/year (Lee & Lee, 2018). These results indicated that ongoing genetic drift appears to be faster on Jeju Island than that on the South Korea mainland. This circumstance may alert the emergence of new genotypes or variant in the Jeju pig populations against which the current G2b vaccine may provide incomplete protection. This could lead to a \u2018counterattack\u2019 (reverse transmission) from Jeju Province to the mainland causing a recurrence of the 2013\u20132014 pandemics. Thus, novel variants may emerge via persistent genetic drifts during endemic outbreaks and may serve as a source for the resurgence of epizootics. This possibility remind us the necessity for monitoring and surveillance of the molecular epidemiology and aetiological characteristics of field PEDV isolates to identify and subsequently secure new vaccine seeds among them to predict and prepare for forthcoming national\u2010wide or global epidemics. This study improves our understanding of the genetic diversity of PEDV field strains on Jeju Island and suggests that relatively swift and independent evolutionary processes continue to occur leading to the accumulation of non\u2010lethal mutations indispensable for viral fitness in its host environment.",

(g\u2013l) Haematoxylin and eosin\u2010stained tissue sections of the jejunum from virus\u2010inoculated and negative\u2010control pigs (100\u00d7 magnification). Jejunum specimens from piglets infected with the KNU\u2010141112 or KNU\u20101807 strain showed acute diffuse atrophic enteritis with vacuolation of the superficial epithelial cells (panels g\u2013k). The normal villous epithelium of the jejunum was recorded in the mock\u2010inoculated piglet (panel l). (m\u2013r) Detection of PEDV antigen by IHC analysis of the jejunum tissue sections from virus\u2010inoculated and negative\u2010control pigs (200\u00d7 magnification). Immunostaining of PEDV antigen appears as brown staining and was detected in the epithelial cells of the jejunum in all PEDV KNU\u2010141112\u2010 and KNU\u20101807\u2010inoculated piglets (panels m\u2013q). No PEDV antigen was detected in the jejunum of the mock\u2010inoculated piglet (panel r) [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]",
