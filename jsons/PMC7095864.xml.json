By comparison, (electro)magnetic actuation has several unique properties. For example, the superparamagnetic particles can be remotely manipulated by a permanent magnet or an electromagnet located off-chip, allowing users to run dedicated tests in single-use disposables at low cost. Because the magnetic interaction is unaffected by surface charges, pH, ionic strength or temperature, it is compatible with a wide range of substrate materials and (bio)chemical processes. In addition, most prominent features of a bioassay, such as extraction, transport, mixing and detection, can be realized by exploiting superparamagnetic particles and their magnetic properties24.",

The novelty of the method lies in the way that the droplet itself becomes a pump, valve, mixer, solid-phase extractor and real-time thermocycler. Interfacing the RNA sample preparation with real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) makes the bioassay superior to tests currently marketed. (At present, the following RT-PCR kits for identifying H5N1 are commercially available: LightMix Kit for Influenza virus A H5, N1, M2 and H5N1 (TIB MOLBIOL/Roche), Avian Flu H5N1 RT-PCR Kit (1-step) (Veredus Laboratories), artus Influenza H5 LC RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen), and TaqMan Influenza A/H5 Kit v1.0 (Applied Biosystems).

Encapsulating the droplet in mineral oil both reduces the friction between the aqueous droplet and the solid surface and prevents the evaporation of the aqueous phase. The volume ratio of the aqueous phase and the mineral oil is 100:1 for biochemical processes at room temperature and 1:5 for processes that require temperatures of up to 100 \u00b0C. Similar to a biphasic segmented flow in microchannels, the aqueous phase glides on a thin film of mineral oil25. This thin film is essential for handling highly viscous body fluids, such as a feces suspension, saliva or whole blood. Aside from their role as force mediators for manipulating the droplet in a magnetic field (Fig. 1b\u2013g), the superparamagnetic particles serve temporarily as a solid phase for biochemical processes (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Pulling the superparamagnetic particles out of the aqueous droplet during solid-phase extraction (SPE) requires raising their concentration by 1,000\u20132,500% to overcome the resistance imposed by the surface tension of the aqueous droplet. Owing to an inherent property of magnetic forces, the actuation of the droplet is distant from the surface, making it possible to place the droplet on a chip, run a dedicated test and then dispose of the chip. To perform temperature-controlled biochemical processes in real time within a droplet, the chip is placed on a microfabricated heater26 with an integrated optical detection system27.",

To minimize the RT-PCR run time, each thermocycling step is shortened by decreasing the holding time and/or increasing the temperature, but this is done without compromising the PCR product specificity, yield and efficiency. Because we continuously monitor the fluorescence signal and the temperature within the droplet during the PCR, the thermocycling conditions can be optimized over the course of one experiment (Fig. 3). Shorter thermocycles are preferable for reducing the thermal burden on the DNA polymerase. Rather moderate heating and cooling rates of +11.5 \u00b0C/s and \u22125.6 \u00b0C/s, respectively, are a compromise between the low total mass of the thermocycler (36 mg) and the low heat conductivity of the disposable chip material. However, using a disposable chip avoids cross-contamination and keeps operational costs low. Although the passive cooling makes up 27% of the overall process time, we abstain from active cooling to reduce the overall power consumption. The overall RT-PCR run time for an experiment that uses a SYBR Green\u2013based format with an antibody-modified hot-start polymerase is 21 min 40 s. Run times can be further shortened by using a two-step, rather than a three-step, thermocycling protocol and by reducing the difference between consecutive temperatures.",

If the RT-PCR is carried out in 50-\u03bcl volumes in a conventional thermocycler, the PCR efficiency is close to 100% (data not shown). We hypothesize that the PCR efficiency in our system is affected by the evaporation of water from the RT-PCR buffer at elevated temperatures, which causes the relative concentration of the RT-PCR components to deviate from their optimal values.
