Firstly, this study revealed that the average incubation period of paediatric patients was eight days, which is longer than adults. One recent study reported that the median incubation period of COVID-19 was three days.12 Secondly, similar to adults, fever and cough were the dominant symptoms for paediatrics but less severe. In addition, four patients experienced diarrhea during the disease course while diarrhea is rare in adults.

All patients relieved the symptom three to four days after admitted to hospital. However, 15.73% (173/1099) patients were categorized into severe subgroups based on the recently study. This difference may be due to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 between children and adult. Therefore, we compared the immune profiles between paediatrics and adults. Children showed higher level of T cell and its subgroup cells (CD8+ T cells and B cells), but lower IL-6 and CRP level after infection. T lymphocytes exert antivirus function and balance immune response. In SARS-CoV infection, CD8+ T cells were the main inflammatory cells infiltrated into the pulmonary and played a vital role in virus clearance. However, it could also induce immune injury by inflammation cytokines.16\n,\n17 In another study about SARS-CoV, depletion of CD4+ T cells led to reduced capability of lymphocytes recruitment and cytokine production, which resulted in immune mediated delayed clearance of SARS-CoV.18 SARS-Cov-2 shares high similarity in genome and protein structure with SARS-CoV, the immune response of these two disease might be similar to some extent. IL-6 a key cytokine contributes to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions. It can be promptly and transiently produced in response to infections and involved in the production of acute phase proteins including CRP, proliferation of B-lymphocytes and neutrophils.19 The serum IL-6 level usually increase during infection and dramatically elevation of serum IL-6 often associated with severe infection.20\n,\n21 Antonio and his colleagues have reported that children with H1N1infection induces an early and significant upregulation of IL-6 expressions. Importantly, IL-6 was significantly correlated with specific clinical findings, such as severity of respiratory compromise and fever.22 In our study, only two paediatric patients (16%) showed elevated IL-6 level with less than 5 fold increases. The average level of IL-6 in paediatrics was lower than adults, which may be partially responsible for the less severe symptoms in paediatric patients. Additionally, as children usually belong to the second or third-generation infection, the virulence of virus may be decreased when children infected. Interestingly, we didn't tracked further infection transmitted by these patients. This might be due to the immune situation and low viral load for children. Whether children were less capability in disease spreading and the underlying mechanism needs more investigation.",

In this study, we enrolled twelve cases for analysis, which might cause the incomplete understanding the clinical features of this group. Multi-center study recruiting more patients with different age group is required in future. Secondly, since all the clinical data were collected retrospectively, the information, particular the laboratory information, was incompletely in some individuals. Finally, most patients were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission. This may affect the judgement of the final outcome and continued observations is needed. Taking together, this study described the clinical features of paediatric patients infected SARS-CoV-2. The paediatrics showed mild symptom and different immune profile. Therefore, paediatric patients are easily to be ignored in practice. We advise that nucleic acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom.",
