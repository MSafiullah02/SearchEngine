Havlin (1989) points out that the cross-over value may be determined by r\nc\n2 ~ t\nc. Above the characteristic length, r\nc, the self-similarity of the surface is lost and the surface may be considered homogeneous. Above time, t\nc the surface may be considered homogeneous, since the self-similarity property disappears, and \u201cregular\u201d diffusion is now present. For a homogeneous surface where D\nf is equal to 2, and when only diffusional limitations are present, p = \u00bd as it should be. Another way of looking at the p = \u00bd case (where D\nf,bind is equal to two) is that the analyte in solution views the fractal object, in our case, the receptor-coated biosensor surface, from a \u201clarge distance.\u201d In essence, in the association process, the diffusion of the analyte from the solution to the receptor surface creates a depletion layer of width (\u00d0t)\u00bd where \u00d0 is the diffusion constant. This gives rise to the fractal power law, (Analyte\u00b7Receptor)~t(3\u2212Df,bind)/2. For the present analysis, t\nc is arbitrarily chosen and we assume that the value of the t\nc is not reached. One may consider the approach as an intermediate \u201cheuristic\u201d approach that may be used in the future to develop an autonomous (and not time-dependent) model for diffusion-controlled kinetics.",

This is further corroborated by low values of the r\n2 factor (goodness-of-fit). In that case, one resorts to a dual-fractal analysis (four parameters; k\n1, k\n2, D\nf1, and D\nf2) to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The single-fractal analysis presented above is thus extended to include two fractal dimensions. At present, the time (t = t\n1) at which the \u201cfirst\u201d fractal dimension \u201cchanges\u201d to the \u201csecond\u201d fractal dimension is arbitrary and empirical.

This is just one possible method of analyzing the kinetics of the different analyte-recptor (hybridization reactions) presented in this chapter. Alternative expressions for fitting the data are available that include saturation, first-order reaction, and no diffusion limitations, but these expressions are apparently deficient in describing the heterogeneity that inherently exists on the surface. One might justifiably argue that the appropriate modeling may be achieved by using a Langmuirian or other approach. The Langmuirian approach may be used to model the data presented if one assumes the presence of discrete classes of sites (for example, double exponential analysis as compared with a single-fractal analysis). Lee and Lee (1995) report that the fractal approach has been applied to surface science, for example, adsorption and reaction processes. These authors point out that the fractal approach provides a convenient means to represent the different structures and the morphology at the reaction surface. They also draw attention to the use of the fractal approach to develop optimal structures and as a predictive approach. Another advantage of the fractal technique is that the analyte-receptor association (as well as the dissociation reaction) is a complex reaction, and the fractal analysis via the fractal dimension and the rate coefficient provides a useful lumped parameter(s) analysis of the diffusion-limited reaction occurring on a heterogeneous surface.",

It is a convenient means (since it is a lumped parameter) to make the degree of heterogeneity that exists on the surface more quantitative.

It is also recognized that, in some cases, this nonselective adsorption may not be a significant component of the adsorbed material and that this rate of association, which is of a temporal nature, would depend on surface availability. If the nonselective adsorption were to be accommodated into the model, there would be an increase in the heterogeneity on the surface, as, by its very nature, nonspecific adsorption is more homogeneous than specific adsorption.

Also, a change in the bulk concentration has a significant impact on hybridization kinetics. They analyzed hybridization kinetics on glass substrates. One 22-mer strand (bound DNA) was immobilized via a phenylene-diisocyanate linker molecule on the glass substrate. The dye-labeled (Cy3) complementary strand was in solution in a reaction chamber.

They explain that the use of PNA in their system permits the highly specific and selective binding at low ionic strength. Uno et al. (2007) point out that IS-FET based biological sensors are attractive in the sense that they are of small size and weight, provide a fast response, are portable, can be mass produced at a low cost, and are highly reliable. They further report that IS-FET-based DNA sensors have exhibited potential in clinical and research applications. Uno et al. (2007) report that the IS-FET can detect surface potential changes due to the surface adsorption of charged molecules in an aqueous environment (Souteyrand et al., 1997; Berney et al., 2000; Frits et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004).

They have a stem-loop structure with complementary ends that anneal to each other. A fluorophore and a quencher are at opposite ends. Blair et al. (2007) explain that the loop structure is complementary to the target. Thus, as the beacon binds to the target, the fluorophore is separated from the quencher. This leads to an increase in the fluorescence, and is proportional to the amount of the DNA produced (Tyagi and Kramer, 1996, Leone et al., 1998, Guilietti et al., 2001, Summerer and Marx, 2002, Marras et al., 2006).",

The values of the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D\nf, for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.9 and 11.10. Note that for the lower 42 nM template concentration a single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding kinetics, whereas for the higher 420 nM template concentration a dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. This would seem to indicate that there is a change in the binding mechanism as one goes from the lower (42 nM template) to the higher (420 nM template) concentration.",

The analysis of both the binding as well as the dissociation (wherever applicable) provides a more complete picture of the reaction occurring on the sensor chip surface, besides providing for values of the affinities wherever applicable.

For this to occur, the characteristic length of the turbulent boundary layer may have to extend a few monolayers above the sensor chip surface to affect bulk diffusion to and from the surface. However, given the extremely laminar flow regimes in most biosensors this may not actually take place. The sensor chip (arrays/microarrays/DNA chips) surface is characterized by grooves and ridges, and this surface morphology may lead to eddy diffusion. This eddy diffusion can then help to enhance the mixing and extend the characteristic length of the boundary layer to affect the bulk diffusion to and from the surface.",

This is of particular value primarily in the biomedical area, and also in other areas of application. For example, the identification of DNA sequences is of particular value in clinical pathology. A clinical pathologist is a medical doctor responsible for the diagnosis of diseases based on the analysis of body fluids, for example, blood and urine. The earlier one may detect and diagnose the probable onset of diseases the earlier one can begin the medical protocols necessary to help prevent, alleviate, or correct the onset of, especially, debilitating and intractable diseases. It is hoped that fractal analysis should be particularly helpful in providing a better understanding of the onset of diseases, particularly those that are insidious and debilitating. Any insight that is made available by such an analysis that helps in the management of intractable diseases should prove invaluable.",
