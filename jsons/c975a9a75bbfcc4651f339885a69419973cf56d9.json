            "text": "Despite panic and chaos COVID-19 has generated in over two hundred countries, 1 the role of neurosurgeons has never been more relevant and challenging. The health system in Nepal was never geared to face onslaught of an infectious disease. N95 masks were being sparingly used and most of the centers did not have proper HVAC equipped operating rooms, let alone negative pressure isolation rooms. Gearing up to prepare for a pandemic with proper isolation and strict protocols was at first sight impossible. Piling up equipment and training of manpower was difficult but urgently required. However, hospitals along with government's intervention were quick in putting up isolation centers, training manpower and categorizing hospital across the country into levels of care according to complexity of cases. 2 Regional hubs were identified to coordinate the care. At Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital, we designated a separate complex for housing COVID-19 suspects to prevent the unaffected from getting exposed. In few of the hospitals, existing neurosurgical and medical ICU has been converted to Isolation ICU. A separate roster of doctors, nurses and allied staff has been drafted to care for these patients to avoid contamination and allow effective THAPA 2 quarantine of the staff involved in care. Along with lockdown now entering its fourth week, the whole effort is directed to hold the infectious spread in phase 2 of epidemic (to avoid community transmission). Fortunately, the growth in number of cases has been slow and none of the infected have shown serious complications! 3 Nepal, not too dissimilar to many other nations, is facing a scarcity of proper personal protection equipment (PPE) and proper infrastructure. With limited testing for the virus in the community, front line health care workers including neurosurgeons are undeniably at risk of exposure. 2 Besides being reasonably healthy, on being exposed, a higher incidence and risk of death is observed in doctors all over the world. 4 Those who continue their commitment to patient care and provide services despite the risk, could well become super-spreader and cause more harm to their families and the community. Taking precaution and keeping active surveillance are hence of paramount importance.",

            "text": "On the directive of the government, at present all neurosurgical centres have postponed routine cases and some of them stopped their outpatient departments for the lack of protective gears. All the neurosurgical centres have seen drastic reduction in cases. For any emergency case, full protective gear is being worn by all the operative staff. All heath care workers have been asked to wear appropriate category of PPE. 5 have come up with a standard operating protocol for COVID-19 patients. 6 As the lockdown scenario eases, our hospital plans to start routine cases after at least 14 days of home-based quarantine followed by a RDT a day before surgery. A negative study would allow us to operate with usual precautions. delaying would make the condition permanently worse. 6 In keeping with the worldwide efforts and recommendations, the logic behind the rationing of services and resource lowers risk of exposure, keeping ICU beds and ventilators free to absorb any surge in complicated coronavirus infected patients and conserve on limited consumables. Hence the role of neurosurgeon as a \"Decision-maker\" and \"Manager\" is vital in such demanding situations. 7, 8 Besides it is also our responsibility to lead and take care of our team both physically and psychologically. In desperate situations it is important to circulate correct and morale THAPA 4 boosting information. We have started \"Viber\" group messaging among our staff, circulating information-updates on \"what to do at home and work\" and conducting polls to know about any issue related to health and address each of them individually. As a public responsibility we are counselling families of our patients regarding do's and don'ts in these hazardous conditions. Neurosurgeons in such a role, can become an effective \"Communicator\". 7, 8 During these challenging times, the importance and role of neurosurgical emergency cannot be underestimated. While Covid-19 being a respiratory primarily respiratory pathogen, neurosurgeons do often access pathology through the direct upper airway exposure, i.e. transnasal/trans-sphenoidal exposure or pre-sigmoid or trans-labyrinthine exposure for various skull base emergencies. At Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital as in other hospitals across Nepal, the neurosurgical faculties joined forces to conduct \"Fever Clinic/ COVID19 Screening Clinic\" to orient the health care workers of the need, teach proper use of PPE and supervise thorough conduct of the clinic. Our nurses have offered to work in designated isolated ICUs (for COVID-19 suspects/ positive patients). We conducted online classes for the junior doctors and other health staffs mitigating their anxieties and counsel them of their roles in the community. Some of us even prepared and shared public videos and appearances to teach the community and advise governing bodies on pertinent actions. In doing such activities, we served the role as a \"Community leader\". 7, 8 To continue with medical education program, most of the centres have started online educational meetings for undergraduates as well as post graduates on \"Zoom\", \"Google Meeting\" platforms to name a few.",
