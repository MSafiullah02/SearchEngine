The SARS-CoV-2 infection of this patient was confirmed by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on Jan. 29, 2020. As a countermeasurement, conventional anti-infection and anti-virus treatment was conducted, combined with a one-day intravenous drip of methylprednisolone to avoid developing cytokine storm. Also, intravenous infusion of human immunoglobulin injection was performed to improve body immunity. With these treatments, the body temperature kept fluctuated between 36.4 \u2103and 37.9 \u2103until it became normal on January 30. However, the patient lost appetite, the nasogastric feeding tube was used to provide comprehensive nutritional treatment with a nasogastric enteral nutrient solution.

Nowadays, more than 400'000 cases and 18'000 death of COVID-19 outbreak in all over the world bring a big challenge for therpy 2 . In this pandemic, aged patients who suffered from severe pneumonia with multiple chronic diseases, are the susceptible population and have the highest fatality rate 3 . Hence, elderly patients need more special attention and effective rescue. Method: Review of clinical history. Results: On Jan. 22, 2020, an 86-year-old man claimed a 2 days fever and cough history arrived in the hospital with 38.8 \u00b0C body temperature. Multiple chronic diseaseswere founded on this patient including unstable angina, cardiomegaly, cardiac function level II, lacunar infarction, cerebral arteriosclerosis, hypertension level III, hypertensive cardiopathy, senileheart valve disorders, calcification of aortic valve, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypoproteinemia, chronic kidney disease stage II, and chronic pancreatitis. Typical ground-glass opacities were observed by the result of computer tomography(CT) scan in patient of posterior, back, and basal segments of left apex",

On February 15 and 19, 2020, results of the oropharyngeal swab specimens with rRT-PCR demonstrated negative of SARS-CoV-2 on this patient. Conclusion: this optimal therapeutic regimen should be formulated based on aged COVID-19 patients with multiple chronic diseases in order to control relative symptoms and to benefit the patients. Here, the available occasion of pantoprazole were inconclusive and the case requires further evaluation in treatment of COVID-19. Keywords: COVID-19, Multiple Chronic Diseases",
