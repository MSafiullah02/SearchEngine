Management of severe acute respiratory symptoms (SARS) caused by the novel corona virus often includes intensive care and invasive ventilation. One important complication associated with COVID-19 disease and a potential differential diagnosis in sudden respiratory distress is pulmonary embolism (PE). A retrospective cohort study by Zhou et al. demonstrated respiratory failure to be the most common complication with 54% of the patients leading transfers to the Intensive Care Unit and death. Severe coagulopathy was present in 19%, but rates differed significantly between survivors (7%) and non-survivors (50%) [1]. This phenomenon is already well known in interalia influenza-associated pneumonia and leads to a predisposition for ischemic events and thrombosis [2]. On this basis, recent data open the discussion of anticoagulation in severe cases of COVID-19 as treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) appeared to be associated with reduced mortality [3]. Therefore, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) recently published the recommendation that all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 should receive a prophylactic dose of LMWH during hospitalization, in the absence of any contraindications such as active bleeding or platelet counts of less than 25 \u00d7 109/l [4].",

A potential alternative to ceCT for this indication is perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) using [99mTc]-labeled macroaggregated albumin (MAA). Due to the high risk of aerosol production associated with ventilation ([99mTc]-labeled aerosols) scans, the Society of Nuclear Medicine of Northern America discouraged the use of classic imaging combination of ventilation-perfusion in patients with COVID-19 in a recent communication by Zuckier et al. [7]. Ventilation scans should be omitted in any patient with known or suspected COVID-19 infection; therefore, a chest X-ray based algorithm was proposed, with perfusion only SPECT scans in patients without pulmonary opacities. This excludes all patients with pulmonary infiltrates and therefore the majority of patients with critical illness associated with COVID-19.",

In fact, patients with pulmonary infiltrates show stronger perfusion in the non-affected lung areas. As a result, clots should be expected in vessels of non-affected pulmonary segments. This can be observed in recently published cases of pulmonary emboli on ceCT in COVID-19 patients [6].",

But usually, hemorrhage and infarction are found only in few affected areas, while areas with fresh PE did not have the time to develop changes due to the reduced perfusion.",
