The topology of the graph G is represented by a symmetric N\u00d7N adjacency matrix A with spectral radius \u03bb1, which is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix A of the contact graph. In an SIS epidemic process [2\u20137] on the graph G, the viral state of a node i at time t is specified by a Bernoulli random variable Xit\u2208{0,1}: Xit=0, when node i is healthy, but susceptible, and Xit=1, when node i is infected at time t. A node i at time t can only be in one of these two states: infected, with probability Pr[Xi(t)=1], or healthy but susceptible to the infection, with probability Pr[Xi(t)=0]=1\u2212Pr[Xi(t)=1]. The recovery or curing process for node i is a Poisson process with rate \u03b4 and the infection rate over the link i,j is a Poisson process with rate \u03b2. Only when node i is infected can it infect its healthy direct neighbors with rate \u03b2. All Poisson curing and infection processes are independent. This description defines the continuous-time, Markovian homogeneous SIS epidemic process on a graph G. The SIS process can be alternatively described in terms of \u201ctime\u201d random variables, which is valuable for the remainder of this article. The recovery time R of a node i is the duration between the time at which node i is just infected and the subsequent time at which node i is again recovered and healthy. Analogously, the infection time T is the time needed for a just infected node to infect one of its direct, healthy neighbors. In a Poisson process [8], interevent times are exponentially distributed so that both recovery time R and infection time T are exponential random variables with mean ER=1\u03b4 and ET=1\u03b2, respectively. We do not consider (a) heterogeneous epidemics, where each node i can have its own curing rate \u03b4i and each link i,j its own infection rate \u03b2ij nor (b) time-dependent rates \u03b2t and \u03b4t as in Ref. [9]. Perhaps, more importantly, we limit ourselves to a mean-field approximation of the SIS process.",

For SIS epidemic processes on networks, a non-Markovian infection was reported in Ref. [11] to alter the epidemic threshold significantly. The SIS process with general infection and recovery times has been analyzed in Ref. [12]. In the Weibullian SIS model, as coined in Ref. [13], the exponential distribution of the infection time T is extended to a Weibull distribution with probability density function (pdf) [8, p. 56],\n(1)fTWeibullx;\u03b1=\u03b1bxb\u03b1\u22121e\u2212xb\u03b1,which is explained in Sec. III and Appendix A. In Refs. [11,12], the Weibullian SIS model is extensively studied, generalizes the Markovian process, and parameterizes the non-Markovian behavior via the shape parameter \u03b1 in Eq. (1). The limiting case \u03b1\u2192\u221e of the Weibullian SIS process is analyzed by a mean-field governing equation in Ref. [13], when the Weibull probability density function Eq. (1) reduces to a Dirac delta function and the corresponding epidemic threshold was found to be 1/ln(1+\u03bb1). Simulations hinted that 1/ln(1+\u03bb1) is the largest epidemic threshold for any Weibull infection time. That result is partly verified in Ref. [14] by an independent simulation, based on Ref. [15] and revisited here in Sec. V.",

The generation time is usually obtained by monitoring the first cases and secondary cases in households and follows skewed distributions, which have been fitted by the Gamma, Weibull, or lognormal distribution. For example, Heijne et al.\n[17] evaluated a norovirus outbreak [18] in Sweden in 1999 by fitting the generation time with a Gamma distribution. Cowling et al.\n[19] fitted the generation time of influenza in Hong Kong with all the three distributions and indicated that the Weibull distribution performs slightly better than the Gamma and lognormal distributions, based on the Akaike information criterion. The generation time of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Singapore in 2003 is well fitted by the Weibull distribution [20]. Furthermore, the Weibull distribution was also used to fit [21] the generation time of an Ebola outbreak in Uganda in 2000. In summary, real disease measurements suggest to consider Weibull, Gamma, and lognormal infection times.",

Section IV considers the occurrence time of an infection in a given interval and generalizes a fundamental theorem in Poisson theory to a renewal process setting, which helps to interpret the behavior of the non-Markovian mean-field epidemic threshold for any infection time distribution. We present Lagrange series for the Weibull mean-field epidemic threshold in Sec. VI, which illustrates that a Weibull infection time leads to considerably more complicated computation than a Gamma infection time. Section VII compares the non-Markovian mean-field epidemic threshold for both Weibull and Gamma distribution, whereas the conclusion in Sec.

[12] of the non-Markovian SIS analysis on an arbitrary network, where the infection and recovering process are assumed to be independent (as in the Markovian case). However, both the infection time T and the recovery time R can possess an arbitrary distribution, whereas, in Markov theory as mentioned above, T and R are exponential random variables with mean 1\u03b2 and 1\u03b4, respectively. In the homogeneous setting, each node has the same distribution of the curing or recovery time R and each link transfers the viral item following a same distribution of the infection time T. Only the metastable state of the non-Markovian SIS epidemic process is analyzed in Ref. [12] in a mean-field setting. Assuming that the metastable state exists and invoking renewal theory, the mean-field steady state probability vi\u221e of infection of node i is shown in Ref.

Thus, the SIS model with a Gamma infection time can be interpreted as a dose-infection process: Each infected node can infect each healthy neighbor via a Poisson process with rate r, but only a small dose of infection is transmitted. A healthy node needs to receive k continuous doses of infection from an infected neighbor to become infected. The infection time T in this interpretation follows a Gamma distribution with \u03be=k and b\u0393=1/r. The overall effective infection rate \u03c4=ERET=rk\u03b4. Thus, there exists a dose threshold\nkc such that, if k>kc, then the Gamma SIS process is below the epidemic threshold, while if k<kc, then it is above the threshold. Here, the dose threshold kc can be a real number. Equating \u03c4c;\u03931\u03be=rkc\u03b4 in Eq.

That theorem associates the Poisson process to the uniform distribution and indicates that a Poisson process can be viewed as the \u201cmost\u201d random process, void of any correlation. Here, we investigate the generalization of this theorem to a renewal process [8, Chapter 8], where events still occur independent of the others, but where the interarrival time of renewal events has a general distribution, instead of an exponential distribution as in the Poisson process. In particular, we compute the probability ys,t that a renewal event happens between s and s+ds, given that precisely one renewal occurs in the interval 0,t, where s\u2264t. We denote the interarrival times in the renewal process by \u03c41,\u03c42,... and the time that the kth renewal occurs by Wk.

For \u03b1<1, a Weibull event occurs increasingly likely at smaller times, the smaller \u03b1 is. For \u03b1>1, the occurrence of a Weibull event is more evenly distributed over the entire interval with preference at later times. Figure 1 may also be consulted in practice to characterize a disease, if the occurrence time of an infection can be measured for an SIS process (with repeated infections and recoveries for each node). Indeed, if the recovery of each node is deterministic at t,2t,3t,..., then Fig. 1 shows that Weibullian infections with small shape parameter \u03b1 occur most likely soon after the recovery moment, implying that the node is infected most of the time. A large \u03b1, however, reflects that a node is with high probability healthy for a long time, but becomes infected, just before the recovery of the next cycle takes place. For a random time interval V, a similar interpretation holds, but the recovery times for each node occur at different times V1,V2,...

To cause a network-wide persistence of the epidemic, the viral item only needs a small \u201cpush\u201d to infect a substantial part of the nodes long enough to enter the endemic state. In other words, a weak strength of the viral item to infect nodes, which is related to the effective infection rate \u03c4c;W1\u03b1, is sufficient to cause endemic behavior. As a consequence, \u03c4c;W1\u03b1 is small for small \u03b1, which agrees with Figure 2. The other regime for large \u03b1 is understood analogously. Most nodes are likely most of the time healthy and infected only shortly when \u03b1 is large.

Similar results for a Gamma infection time are deduced. The mean-field epidemic threshold \u03c4c;W1\u03b1 and \u03c4c;\u03931\u03be increases with \u03b1 and \u03be, respectively, from 0 for \u03b1,\u03be=0 to ln1+\u03bb1\u22121 for \u03b1,\u03be\u2192\u221e. The Lagrange series Eqs. (19) and (20), and perhaps the asymptotic expansion Eq.

(5) with lognormal infection time T and exponential recovery time R, normalized by ETlognormal=1\u03b2, which allows us to eliminate \u03bc=\u2212ln\u03b2\u2212\u03c322, is the solution \u03c4c;l1\u03c3 for \u03c4 in\n(23)1\u03bb1+1=1\u03c32\u03c0\u222b0\u221ee\u2212y\u03c4e\u2212(logy+\u03c322)22\u03c32ydy.Since lim\u03c3\u21920fTlognormal(x)=\u03b4Dx\u2212e\u03bc=\u03b4Dx\u22121\u03b2, where \u03b4Dx is the Dirac function, the threshold criterion Eq.

The solution for \u03c4 in Eq. (23) poses a similar difficulty as for the Weibull infection time and is placed on the agenda for future research, because simulations in Fig. 4 exhibit a similar behavior for the lognormal epidemic threshold \u03c4c;l1\u03c3\u22121 as for \u03c4c;W1\u03b1 and \u03c4c;\u03931\u03be. The criterion Eq. (4) for the epidemic threshold shows that the analysis can be repeated for any other distribution of the infection time and other recovery times than exponential. Thus, the presented Weibull and Gamma analysis may serve as a guideline for computations with other distributions.\n Since the SIR epidemic threshold is slightly higher than the SIS epidemics (due to re-infections that potentially lead to more infected nodes), the SIS non-Markovian threshold can be regarded as a lower bound for SIR, so enlarging the scope of the presented theory. Finally, as the influence of the underlying contact graph is incorporated, the non-Markovian thresholds \u03c4c;W1\u03b1,\u03c4c;\u03931\u03be and \u03c4c;l1\u03c3\u22121 may be more suitable than the classical reproduction number R0, which is critically reconsidered in Ref. [29].",
