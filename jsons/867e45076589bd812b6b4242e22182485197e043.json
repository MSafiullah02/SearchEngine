It appears that the disclaimer made for financial investments applies equally well to emerging infections-past experience is no guarantee of future performance.",

He was admitted and discharged, then re-admitted at a second hospital where the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed on 20 May. 6 In the week before diagnosis, this index case was not suspected to have MERS-CoV and, therefore, his caregivers did not use appropriate isolation precautions and personal protective equipment. As a result of this critical lapse, South Korea experienced a large outbreak and is now the country with the second largest number of MERS-CoV cases in the world, after Saudi Arabia. As of 23 July 2015, this outbreak stands at 186 cases, with 36 deaths and a case fatality rate of 19%; 7 South Korea appears to be on track to declare the outbreak over by August 2015 after completing two incubation periods without new cases. Over 16 000 individuals had to be quarantined for potential exposure and over 30 healthcare facilities had to undergo investigations for possible MERS-CoV transmission.",

A WHO team, led by Dr Keiji Fukuda, was dispatched to investigate this outbreak. 8 Initial concerns, about viral mutation resulting in a more transmissible pathogen were not borne out by viral sequencing data. The concept of 'super-spreaders' was again mooted. For severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) veterans watching this outbreak unfold, a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu prevailed. These events reinforced five key observations and learning points (Box 1). With over a billion individuals travelling annually, the risk of emerging infections crossing borders is a reality that needs to be managed with calibrated, sensible approaches. South Korea's experience illustrates the ongoing need for a high level of vigilance. To control emerging infections for which no preventive vaccines or proven specific therapies are available, classical outbreak control measures are still required-transmission can be terminated by isolating infectious cases and quarantining exposed individuals during the incubation period. Suspect cases must be cared for with appropriate precautions in order to protect hospital staff, visitors and other patients, all of whom would inadvertently become vectors for spread, if infected.",

In Singapore, health advisories for travellers to and from Korea and border screening with thermal scanners were implemented, along with the usual circulars to all healthcare facilities and doctors to increase vigilance for travel-related importations. Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the Communicable Disease Centre are the designated facilities in Singapore for outbreak management, including Ebola, MERS-CoV and avian influenza. Over the past 3 years, our hospital has evaluated over 300 patients who either walked in themselves or were referred by a doctor for possible MERS-CoV infection. Our Emergency Department doctors balance the risk of missing a case with the challenges of admitting reluctant patients to isolation rooms (which are a finite resource). For frontline clinicians without the luxury of hindsight, knowledge of the case definitions (pneumonia plus travel exposure) is balanced by awareness that the spectrum of disease includes mild infection, clinical presentations may evolve and upper respiratory samples may not detect infection, especially early in the course of illness. 10 What happened in South Korea could happen in any country in Asia-our task is to stop the outbreak before it happens. These emerging infection outbreaks reinforce the need to stay vigilant and to invest in capacity building to detect and respond quickly to outbreaks with effective, decisive actions. Global health security requires this commitment from every country because outbreaks teach us that we are only as strong as our weakest link.",
