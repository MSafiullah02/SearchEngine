            "text": "Since the identification of RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) in 1998, RNAi has become an effective tool to inhibit gene expression. The inhibition mechanism is triggered by introducing a short interference double-stranded RNA (siRNA,19~27 bp) into the cytoplasm, where the guide strand of siRNA (usually antisense strand) binds to its target messenger RNA and the expression of the target gene is blocked. RNAi has been widely applied in gene functional analysis, and as a potential therapeutic strategy in viral diseases, drug target discovery, and cancer therapy. Among the factors which may compromise inhibition efficiency, how to design siRNAs with high efficiency and high specificity to its target gene is critical. Although many algorithms have been developed for this purpose, it is still difficult to design such siRNAs. In this review, we will briefly discuss prediction methods for siRNA efficiency and the problems of present approaches.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is an ancient mechanism for gene regulation which is mediated by short interfering doublestrand RNA (siRNA) [1 -2]. The basic steps in knockdown expression of an siRNA target gene are as follows. First, long doublestrand RNA in the cytoplasm is processed into 21-to 23nucleotide siRNAs with the characteristic 3' overhangs of two nucleotides by Dicer, a ribonuclease III enzyme. Second, the siRNA is incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Third, the RISC complex uses the guide strand (usually the antisense strand) of the siRNA to bind to its target messenger RNA (mRNA). Finally, the target mRNA is cleaved, and the expression of the target gene is inhibited. This process of siRNA inhibition is shown schematically in Figure 1 . Because carefully designed siRNA can specifically inhibit the expression of its target gene without affecting other genes, RNAi has become an effective tool for gene functional analysis [3 -10] . For example, using an RNAi library targeted to nearly 90 % of the 19,427 predicted genes of Caenorhabditis elegans, Simmer et al. investigated the relationship between the phenotype and related sets of genes [6] . In addition, Keating et al. explored the functions of 60 G protein-coupled receptors in C. elegans by RNAi on the whole-genome level [3] . In addition to gene functional analysis, RNAi has also been widely studied for genetic-based therapies. As such, RNAi is a potentially useful method to develop highly specific dsRNA-based gene-silencing therapeutics [11] . RNAi has been called one of the most exciting discoveries in biology in the last couple decades [1]. However, designing siRNAs with high efficiency and high specificity is critical. Here we present a minireview about this topic. We will briefly describe the potential applications of RNAi as an alternative therapeutic strategy, and provide a more detailed discussion of the main prediction methods for siRNA efficiency. Next, we review off-target effects analysis, and indicate some Web servers for siRNA design. Finally, we summarize the review and present possible directions for future research in developing new prediction methods for siRNA efficiency.",

From a theoretical point of view, any gene whose expression contributes to disease is a potential target, from viral genes to oncogenes to genes responsible for heart disease and so on [1]. Through the design of specific siRNAs for the relevant genes, the expression of the target gene can be destroyed without affecting the expression of other genes. RNAi thus holds promise to become a therapeutic agent in the near future. Up to now, RNAi has been widely employed as a potential therapeutic strategy in viral infections [13 -28] , drug target discovery [29 -33] , cancers [34 -38] , and inherited genetic disorders [39, 40] . For example, in order to inhibit the infection of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), Novina et al. devised five siRNAs targeted to the HIV-1 cellular receptor CD4 and the viral structural Gag protein.",

            "text": "They found that infection with HIV-1 can be efficiently inhibited in mammalian cells [41] . Song et al. studied the application of RNAi in fulminant hepatitis. By designing six siRNAs targeted to Fas, a gene related to apoptosis in a broad spectrum of liver diseases [42] , the researches found that the longevity of 82 % of experimental mice could be significantly prolonged. Based on conservation among the major HBV (hepatitis B virus) genotypes [15] , seven siRNA sequences targeted to HBV mRNAwere designed and used to inhibit HBV in mice by McCaffrey et al.. The results showed that six out of seven siRNAs have an antiviral effect. Two of them are very potent. In the antiviral application of RNAi, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [26, 43] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [24] , and herpes simple virus 2 (HSV-2) [28] have also been studied. For a recent review of siRNAs as the potential drugs, see [44] . For potential applications in cancer therapy, see [35, 45] . In addition, through the genomewide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells infected with Drosophila C virus, Cherry et al. have found a related 66 specific ribosomal proteins which are required for RNAviruses with internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) to be translated [33] . These host proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for curing the related RNA virus. For a review of its applications in drug target discovery, see [31] . From the point of view of systems biology, genes do not act independently. They interact with one another and form genetic networks. Mapping these networks plays an important role in understanding the state of biological systems, especially complex human disease [46] . In their recent paper [47] , Lehner et al. developed a method for a high-throughput RNAi genetic interaction screen. In order to test the effects of the screen method, they chose the known pathways of EGF (epidermal growth factor), Wnt, Notch, SynMuuA, and SynMuv B. By considering all possible genetic interactions between~31 genes in the above pathways and~1750 library genes, they found 349 genetic interactions between 162 genes which function in the signaling and transcriptional networks. This is the first time RNAi technology has been used for systematic mapping of genetic interactions in C. elegans (animals). Through the experiments, the researches not only validated the known pathway components but also identified new pathway components. In addition, from the 349 genetic interactions, they also found six hub genes, i.e., a class of highly connected genes. The hub genes are all chromatinremodeling components. These genes can act as genetic buffers for a diverse set of genes, and therefore regulate many biological processes. Furthermore, Lehner et al. predicted that human orthologs of these genes are likely to be related to the human genetic diseases. This RNAi-based high-throughput screen method for genetic interaction may provide a way to predict complex human disease-related genes. From the above analysis, we conclude that RNAi is a powerful tool and has been applied in many aspects of molecular biology. Although there are many factors, such as target selection, delivery of siRNA, and so on, involved in the applications of RNAi, siRNA efficiency is one of the most important factors. We will discuss it in detail in following sections. ",

First, a certain number of siRNA sequences and related inhibiting efficiency vis-a-vis their target genes are collected. Second, the collected siRNA sequences are classified into two groups based on inhibition efficiency (high or low efficiency group).

            "text": "Prediction methods of siRNA efficiency based on siRNA sequence characteristics For prediction methods based on siRNA sequence characteristics, the basic assumption is that siRNA efficiency is mainly determined by the siRNA sequence itself. Currently, many sequence characteristics-based methods have been developed. For example, using the experimental data of 180 siRNAs targeted to two target genes, Reynolds et al. presented eight rules for designing high-efficiency siRNAs [48] . These eight rules are as follows: 1. The GC content of the sense strand of siRNA is between 30 and 50 %. 2. There are more than three bases A or U in the region (15th -19th base) of the sense strand. 3. The stable hairpin structure of the sense (antisense) strand of siRNA is not permitted, and the melting temperature (Tm) should be less than 208C. 4. The 19th base of the sense strand of the siRNA should be A. 5. The third base of the sense strand should be A. 6. The 10th base of the sense strand should be U. 7. The 19th base of the sense strand should not be G or C. 8. The 13th base of the sense strand should not be G. Furthermore, a simple algorithm was developed for high-efficiency siRNA design using the above eight rules. For each candidate siRNA sequence, a score S is assigned with initial value S=0. If a candidate siRNA satisfies conditions 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6, then S is added one (S=S+1). If a candidate siRNA can not meet the conditions 7 or 8, then1 is subtracted from S (S=S\u00c01). For condition 2, for each base A or U in the region (15th -19th base) of the sense strand of siRNA, S is added one (S=S+1). Finally, for each candidate siRNA, there is a corresponding score S. The larger S is, the more likely the siRNA has high efficiency. In general cases, the score S is required to be more than 6 (S!6). Through an independent test of 30 siRNAs targeted to 6 genes, the results indicated that there were 17 siRNAs with inhibiting efficiency 80 %. The correct rate is 56.7 %. The shortcoming of the method is that the above eight rules are treated equally. In fact, there is no reason to suppose that the efficiency contribution of the eight rules is equal in inhibiting target mRNA. Recently, Jagla et al. used a larger experimental dataset of 601 siRNAs targeted to 4 genes to deduce the sequence characteristics for high-efficiency siRNA design [49] . From the whole dataset, four separate training datasets were extracted. For each training set, the decision-tree classification method was used to deduce criteria for siRNAs with high efficiency. There were four sets of criteria altogether. These four sets of criteria were merged, and the significant rules were found as follows: 1. The 10th and 19th bases of the sense strand of siRNA should be A or U. 2. The first base of the sense strand should be G or C. 3. There are more than 3 bases A or U in the region (13th -19th base) of the sense strand of siRNA. Obviously, rule 1 is basically the same as Reynolds rules 6 and 7. Rule 3 contains the information of Reynolds rule 2. Finally, the results indicated that prediction accuracy is about 30 % when the inhibiting efficiency of 70 % was taken as a threshold to distinguish a high-or low-efficiency group based on an independent test dataset. Even through the above algorithms conclude that sequence characteristics are very important in determining the efficiency of siRNAs, Patzel et al. consider that the secondary structure of siRNA antisense strand plays an important role [50] . From the experimental data of nine siRNAs targeted to one gene, they found that the siRNA efficiency would be improved if there were more free bases at the 5 or 3 end of the antisense strand. Here free bases refers to the bases that form no base pairs with other bases. The correlation between the number of free bases and siRNA efficiency was as high as 0.94. Further analysis showed that siRNA efficiency was basically irrelevant to the accessibility of target mRNA, sequence characteristics, and the 5 end stability of the antisense strand. Although the correlation between the number of free bases and siRNA efficiency is high, the number of siRNAs is too few. The above conclusions may need further verification. In order to improve the success rate of designing highefficiency siRNAs, Hall et al. have constructed a neural network based on the experimental data of 2182 siRNAs targeted to 34 genes [51] . First, from 2182 siRNAs, they extracted the 200 siRNAs with the highest efficiency and the 200 siRNAs with the lowest efficiency as the training dataset. Second, the neural network was constructed using the characteristics of Cell. Mol. Life Sci.",

In order to deduce the relationship between the target secondary structures and siRNA efficiency, the H-bond index (H-b) was calculated for the siRNAs according to the following steps. First, a certain number of target secondary structures, whose free energy is close to the minimum free energy, were predicted using the Mfold Web server [60] . Second, the frequency for each base in the target region paired to other bases was calculated. For example, if the number of the calculated target secondary structures is 50, and there are 30 opportunities for the first base in the target region to be paired with other bases, the frequency is 0.6 (30/50). Furthermore, if the base in the target region is G or C, the corresponding frequency is multiplied by 3. If the base in the target region is A or U, the corresponding frequency is multiplied by 2. Finally, H-b is calculated by summing of all the weight frequencies in the target region.",

The results indicated that siRNAs with high efficiency had a low H-b. Finally, according to the above conclusions, four siRNAs targeted to a new target gene were designed. The experimental results further confirmed the conclusions. Obviously, if the target region is in the single-chain state, H-b will be very low. From this point of view, siRNAs with high efficiency should be single chains. This conclusion was also observed by Schramm et al [54] . In addition, Overhoff et al. confirmed that siRNA efficiency should be high if the target region was accessible in the target mRNA [55] . Recently, Yiu et al. presented a repelling loop method to evaluate siRNA efficiency based on five minimum or near-minimum free-energy target mRNA secondary structures [56] . There are three challenges in analyzing the relationship between siRNA efficiency and target mRNA secondary structures. First, the most popular method for RNA secondary structure prediction at present is Zuker's Mfold Web server. The prediction accuracy is low for long target mRNA sequences. However, the target mRNA usually is long. For example, from the siRNA database siRecord [61] we obtained 1354 target mRNA sequences without missing values. Among 1354 targets, the shortest and longest sequence lengths are 51 and 2,314,078 bases, respectively. The average target sequence length is 5877 bases, which makes it difficult to get accurate target mRNA secondary structures. Therefore, reliable results of analysis based on target secondary structures cannot be guaranteed. Second, for long target mRNA sequences, the computation time is long and the demands on the computer are high. Sometimes, current PC's struggle to meet the requirements of computation. Third, although Luo et al. formulated the H-b method to analyze the relationship between siRNA efficiency and secondary structures of target mRNA quantitatively [53] , we still do not know how many target secondary structures need to be calculated. Furthermore, the number of samples used in Luos analysis is very small, which makes it difficult to guarantee the reliability of H-b.",

            "text": "For particular target mRNAs, successful design of siRNAs reguires not only high efficiency to silence the target gene but also high specificity. Here, specificity means that the designed siRNAs inhibit only the expression of the target gene, i.e., the designed siRNAs should not have off-target effects. Analysis of off-target effects plays an important role in applications of RNAi. For example, siRNAs may have potential as drugs for treatment of viral diseases. If the designed siRNAs have off-target effects on the human genes, side-effects will result. In order to avoid off-target effects, many methods and programs have been developed [62 -67] . However, the key issue is what criteria should be used to analyze these effects. At first, people found that silence effects can be abolished by only a single central mismatch between the siRNA and corresponding target mRNA [68] . Therefore, the blast program was used to check specificity [69] . The process is very similar to the probe specificity check for oligonucleotide microarrays [70] . First, related parameters such as word length and E value for the blast program are set up. In order to avoid potential other targets of the designed siRNAs, word length is often assigned as the minimum value. Second, the related transcriptome database is selected for the siRNAs. For example, if the target mRNA is a human gene, then the human transcriptome database should be selected. Better siRNAs are found based on analysis of the blast results. In view of their fast running speed, blast programs are still used in the design of siRNAs. However, people also found that the siRNAs could tolerate several mismatches between the siRNAs and the target. Findings show that blast programs may be not suitable for specificity analysis of siRNAs because blast programs can miss some potential targets, which leads to off-target effects. For example, in an investigation of 359 published siRNA sequences, Snove et al found that about 75 % of them had a risk of eliciting non-specific effects [71] . New programs have been developed based on these findings. In Order to deduce the criteria for specificity analysis of siRNAs, gene expression profiling regulated by RNAi was used. Jackson et al. concluded that the similarity between siRNA and target mRNA is 79 % (15/19) and perhaps as few as 11 contiguous nucleotides between them are sufficient to direct silencing of nontargeted transcripts [72] . These results are very similar to Kanes criteria for probe design for oligonucleotide microarrays [73] .",

The Smith-Waterman algorithm was used to calculate the similarity between the siRNAs and human genes, and the in silico offtargets set was obtained with similarity more than 79 %. Comparison of the experimental off-targets set and the in silico off-targets set showed that the false positive rate and false negative rate were more than 99 % and 93 %, respectively. In the meantime, the researches found that off-target effects were associated with the presence of one or more perfect matches (6 -7 bases) between the antisense strand of the siRNA and the 3 untranslated region of the off-targets. These results showed that off-target effects were mainly caused by 3 UTR seed matches rather than the overall identity between siRNAs and non-target mRNAs.",

The second problem is that current analysis of siRNA efficiency is mainly based on factors such as the secondary structure of siRNA antisense strands rather than comprehensive analysis of all factors. The third problem is the off-target analysis of siRNA. Even though some criteria have been formulated, there is no standard for siRNA specificity. In order to design siRNAs with high efficiency and high specificity, all these problems should be considered comprehensively, and new algorithms should be developed.
