Recently, van den Hoogen et al. reported the isolation of a new paramyxovirus in the Netherlands that was tentatively assigned to the Metapneumovirus genus of the Pneumovirinae subfamily (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . This hMPV has been associated with respiratory illnesses ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infection. hMPV is currently being isolated from patients with respiratory disease in several countries suggesting that hMPV may be present throughout the world (Pelletier et al., 2002; Peret et al., 2002; Stockon et al., 2002) . Partial sequence analysis demonstrated sequence similarity between the Dutch and Canadian isolates and the presence of two potential genetic clusters.

Their genomes were sequenced from the gene start codon of the N gene to the one of the M2 gene. The putative gene start signals for the N, P, M and F genes were identified by comparison with those of the hMPV Dutch isolate (NDL00-1) and other pneumoviruses: human and bovine respiratory virus (HRSV, BRSV), avian pneumovirus (APV) and pneumonia virus of the mice (PVM). Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of a well conserved region located at the beginning of each hMPV gene that potentially serves as gene-start signal (Table 2) . However, since these signals were identified from the viral RNA, they remain tentative and should be confirmed by sequencing of the viral mRNA. The same is true for the gene end sequences described below. No sequence variation was observed between the two genetic clusters or the NDL00-1 isolate for N and P putative gene start signals (van den Hoogen et al., 2002) . The putative gene start signal of the M gene had one A/C nucleotide change and the F gene one A/G substitution between the two clusters. The CAN99-81 (cluster 1) putative gene start sequence was identical to the one of NDL00-1 (cluster 1). All gene start sequences contained a (GGGACAAG/AU) motif that is identical to the gene start signal characterized for the matching genes of APV subgroups A, B and C (Dar et al., 2001; Li et al., 1996; Ling et al., 1995; Naylor et al., 1998; Randhawa et al., 1996; Seal, 1998; Seal et al., 2000; Yu et al., 1992) . In contrast, no consensus sequences could be identified as a common gene termination signal. Comparison with NDL00-1 sequences revealed the presence of a putative gene end signal for each of the genes analyzed (bolded in Table 2 ). Each putative gene end signal was conserved between the two hMPV genetic clusters and NDL00-1. Further comparison with APV sequences showed that the putative gene end signal for the hMPV N gene (AGUAAUUA 6 ) was identical to the one characterized for APV-C (Dar et al., 2001; van den Hoogen et al., 2002) .

Our results also show that both hMPV clusters were co-circulating in Canada during 1997 Canada during , 1999 Canada during and 2000 . This is comparable to what is observed for the two subgroups of HRSV, which have been co-circulating in most yearly epidemics (Collins et al., 2001) . Similar to other pneumoviruses, the genetic diversity observed for the hMPV genes may lead to antigenic variability and these two hMPV genetic clusters may also represent two different antigenic groups. However, distinct lineages of HRSV have been identified within each subgroup, and shown to cocirculate during epidemics and to have broad geographic distribution Pringle, 1991, 1995; Coggins et al., 1998; Garcia et al., 1994; Martinez et al., 1999) . The nucleotide identities observed between the two hMPV clusters for each of the genes analyzed are comparable to the ones obtained between members of the two HRSV subgroups (Naylor et al., 1998) . However, a greater proportion of silent nucleic acid substitutions are found in the F genes of hMPV clusters leading to an aa identity that is closer to the one observed within HRSV subgroups. At this point, it is still unclear if the differences observed between the hMPV isolates are representative of two distinct hMPV antigenic subgroups. The characterization of the hMPV G genes for which the antigenic diversity is most evident for RSV and APV, as well as serologic studies, are needed to determine the antigenic significance of the genetic diversity observed for hMPV. Molecular analysis of the N, P, M and F genes provided further support for the assignment of hMPV to the Metapneumovirus genus of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. Analysis of the genomic organization of hMPV revealed several similar features to APVs, especially to the subgroup C (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . They share the same putative gene start sequence (GGGACAAGUGAAA), as well as the same gene end sequences for the N gene (AGUAAUUA 6 ). Although not identical, the gene end sequences of the other genes also show some similarity to APVs. The 3? noncoding region of the M and F genes varies significantly between the two hMPV clusters.
