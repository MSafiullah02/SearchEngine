As\nstated by a WHO guidance document, \u201cEbola virus is likely to\ninactivate significantly faster in the environment than enteric viruses\nwith known waterborne transmission (e.g., norovirus, hepatitis A virus)\u201d.14 However, as has been noted in a recent review,\nthe persistence of enveloped viruses in the water environment varies\nby >2 orders of magnitude.15 Recommendations\nfor Ebola virus-contaminated wastewater disposal were met with debate\n(e.g., refs (16\u221218)) because of uncertainty\nabout Ebola virus persistence within wastewater matrices and the lack\nof a risk-based analysis for waste handling. Wastewater handling recommendations\nhave since been revised to recognize uncertainty in this area and\nto recommend disinfection of latrines and holding of wastewater prior\nto handling to allow Ebola virus inactivation.19\u221221 Additionally,\nsome facilities have opted to provide additional disinfection prior\nto disposal of liquid waste into sewer systems.12 Recent research found both ethanol and hypochlorite to\nbe effective disinfectants for Ebola virus dried on surfaces;22 however, the disinfection kinetics of Ebola\nvirus within liquid matrices remains unknown.

Next,\n100 \u03bcL from each well of the dilution plate was transferred\nto a 96-well cell culture plate seeded with Vero cells. The cells\nwere incubated with virus dilutions for 1 h; then the medium was removed\nfrom the two highest concentrations and rinsed two times with PBS,\nand 200 \u03bcL of fresh culture medium was added. Fresh culture\nmedium (100 \u03bcL) was also added to the remaining wells in the\nplate. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 7 days, inspected\nfor the cytopathic effect (CPE), and scored. Statistical analyses\nand graphing were completed with Microsoft Excel 2011. The natural\nlogarithm of C/Co TCID50 was plotted and fit with a linear trendline for estimation\nof the inactivation constant (k). A literature review\nwas then performed to compare observed inactivation to other environmental\nmatrices.",

To address this uncertainty, we plotted two inactivation curves,\nboth including (Figure 1A) and excluding the measured time zero point (Figure 1B). A linear trendline, as has been previously\nsuggested for viral34 and Ebola virus27 persistence, showed a lower fit (R2 = 0.59 including the time zero time point, and R2 = 0.67 excluding the time zero time point)\nthan that previously observed for Ebola virus in deionized water (R2 > 0.91), but a fit better than that previously\nobserved for Ebola virus in human blood (R2 < 0.29). The inactivation constant (k) was determined\nto be \u22121.08 when including the time zero time point and \u22120.35\nwhen excluding the time zero time point. On the basis of the model\nfit, the T90 (time for 90% inactivation)\nwould be 2.1 days including the time zero time point and 6.6 days\nexcluding the time zero time point.
