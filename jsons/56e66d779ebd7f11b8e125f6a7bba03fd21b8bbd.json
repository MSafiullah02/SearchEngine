The surgical facemask and large shield offered the best protection, while the small standard shield seemed to be effective for larger particles (Fig. 2) . The benefits of larger shields should be weighed against the increased risk of fomite transmission, especially where they cause the user to touch the sides in order to perform tonometry or manipulate the slit lamp arm. Barrier protection, while helpful, should be seen as only one part of a combined approach with hand hygiene and effective cleaning essential to limit viral spread. There is ongoing debate over the use of masks. Evidence from a large-clusterbased randomised control trial showed no benefit from using N95 masks compared to surgical facemasks to reduce influenza and other respiratory viral illnesses [8] . Subsequent meta-analyses have shown similar results with the benefits of filtering facepiece (FFP) masks thought to be offset by discomfort with their prolonged use leading to more frequent manipulation and/or reduced compliance [9] . There may be a similar tradeoff between different sizes of shield with an increased risk of contamination through contact with larger shields.",

Most of the components we used were readily available and the particle counter was not difficult to source. Particle counters are routinely used in our trust to monitor sterility of theatres and pharmacy clean rooms and more recently to test the fit of FFP masks. A limitation of our approach is that we did not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious particles or their source. We performed our study in a room used for intravitreal injections to limit the number of background particles but this remains a potential confounder. We found it reassuring that the standard measures in place were effective and that the larger shield and facemask appeared to offer some additional protection. Despite the close proximity of slit lamp examinations, the effectiveness of shielding together with the short contact time and lack of aerosol generation, leads us to expect the risk of transmission from this route to be low. Viruses spread fear and uncertainty along with disease. Through research, consultation and pragmatic use of evidence, we hope to help build a shield to this as well. ",
