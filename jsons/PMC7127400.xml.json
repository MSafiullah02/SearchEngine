            "text": "Nucleoside analogues are of great interest in medicinal chemistry due to their broad spectrum of biological activities. Extensive search for modified nucleosides has led to the discovery of many potent drugs for treatment of various viral infections1 and diverse types of neoplasms (Fig. 1\n).2 The adverse effects of the available therapies, low selectivity and the observed drug resistance have become a driving force in a search for new analogues with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Numerous modifications of naturally occurring nucleosides have provided analogues with altered sugar and/or nucleobase subunits. Heterocycles containing one or more heteroatoms and carbocycles of various sizes as well as straight or branched chains also with heteroatoms have been applied as an alternative to the furanose ring.3, 4 So far less attention has been paid to the synthesis of analogues having modified nucleobase residues in comparison to sugar-modified analogues due to ensuring base pairing, but recently it has been proven that other aromatic rings are able to base-pair as well.5 A long list of nucleoside analogues continues to expand by incorporation of several linkers such as a 1,2,3-triazole group,6, 7, 8, 9 a carbamoyl10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or an ureidyl function18 among others.",

Isoxazolidines 5 substituted with 1- and 2-naphthyl at C5 were found cytotoxic against HeLa and K562 cell lines (R = 1-naphthyl and 2-naphthyl; IC50 0.05 and 0.09 mM, respectively),23 while cis-configured 5-fluorouracil and 5-thymine derivatives 5 completely inhibited the reverse transcriptase activity of Avian Moloney Virus (AMV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).24 Although (1,2,3-triazolyl)isoxazolidinephosponates 6 did not show antiviral activity at subtoxic concentrations, derivatives of 6 having the unsubstituted and fluorosubstituted phenyl at C4 in the 1,2,3-triazole ring proved slightly cytostatic.25 Encouraged by these results a new series of 5-substituted (3-diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidines 7 was designed (Scheme 1\n). Compounds 7 could be regarded as nucleotide prodrugs due to incorporation of a bioisosteric diethoxyphosphoryl function at C3 of the isoxazolidine ring which mimics nucleoside monophosphate.26 Moreover, it was anticipated that insertion of a carbamoyl linker between the isoxazolidine moiety and careful selection of mono-, di- or trisubstituted phenyl groups as nucleobase replacer would improve their interaction within DNA/RNA strands by forming stronger hydrogen bonds.",

Most of substituted acrylamides 9 used in this paper have already been described in the literature. However, compounds 9ab, 9ad, 9an, 9az and 9ba were prepared according to the standard procedure from commercially available substituted anilines and acryloyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine.29 Cycloadditions of nitrone 8 with acrylamides 9aa\u20139ba were carried out in toluene at 70 \u00b0C and afforded mixtures of diastereoisomeric (3-diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidines trans-10aa\u201310ba and cis-11aa\u201311ba (Scheme 2, Table 1\n). In all cases moderate to good trans/cis diastereoselectivities (de 50\u201380%) were observed. The crude mixtures of the respective cycloadducts were subjected to column chromatography and in almost all cases (except for 10ae, 10ah and 10aq) pure major trans-isomers 10 were separated in moderate to good yields (Table 1). Isolation of pure minor cis-isomers 11, which are very crucial for biological evaluation, was not a trivial task. However, several purifications of the enriched diastereoisomeric mixtures of the respective isoxazolidines 10/11 on silica gel columns proved fruitful for isoxazolidines 11aa, 11ab, 11ac, 11ai, 11aj, 11al, 11am, 11an, 11ap, 11aq, 11ar, 11as, 11at, 11av, 11aw and 11ba (Table 1) making minute quantities of cis-11 available.",

The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h (murine leukemia L1210 cells) or 72 h (human lymphocytic CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified CO2-controlled atmosphere. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were counted in a Coulter counter. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was defined as the concentration of the compound that inhibited cell proliferation by 50%.",
