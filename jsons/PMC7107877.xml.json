Purified microbial PS vaccines have been in use for >40 years, but they have proven to be variably immunogenic and variably efficacious in protecting susceptible populations against invasive meningococcal, pneumococcal, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) diseases [1, 2]. When administered as purified PSs, their effectiveness generally is limited by the modest nature of the immune response, the lack of a memory response, and the inability to stimulate responses in young children who are at the greatest risk for serious infections due to encapsulated organisms. The demonstration that infants could produce protective anticapsular antibody responses following immunization with Hib PS-protein conjugates represented a major advance in public health and laid the groundwork for the subsequent development of new conjugate vaccines [3].",

Reimmunization at 2 and 6 years of age maintains a high degree of protection. Older children and adults require only 1 injection. Vaccines against group A meningococci have been highly effective in preventing disease in a number of regions. In Finland, herd immunity to group A meningococci was induced by vaccinating approximately one-third of the population. Use of vaccines has significantly reduced the prevalence of disease in China. Household contact vaccination has proven to be highly effective in Africa. However, attempts at preparing protein conjugates of group A meningococcal capsular PS have not increased immunogenicity.",

Alternative approaches have focused on other antigens, such as the outer membrane vesicle. The outer membrane\u2014vesicle vaccine has good efficacy in older children and adults; however, the data for infants are mixed [11]. Following extensive testing, an OMV vaccine prepared from an epidemic group B strain in New Zealand has been provisionally licensed. This vaccine has been introduced into the population in an attempt to control the epidemic [12]. Investigators at Wyeth and Oxford University, England, are studying detoxified meningococcal lipopolysaccharide as a conjugate vaccine. The inner core of the meningococcal lipopolysaccharide is relatively highly conserved, and the use of appropriate conjugation procedures can result in a broadly cross-reactive meningococcal lipopolysaccharide vaccine.",

One early explanation for this anergy was that infants lacked the relevant PS-specific B cells. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that an insufficient antibody repertoire cannot account for the refractoriness of the infant to PS vaccination. Infants can produce anti-PS antibodies after PS conjugate vaccination, and studies of the Hib PS antibody repertoire have shown that infants can utilize the same variable (V) region genes as those used by adults [14]. Despite intensive investigation, the mechanism underlying the unresponsiveness of the infant to PS vaccination has not been precisely identified. The mechanism is likely multi-factorial and may involve lacking expression of sufficient costimulatory molecules and/or their respective receptors and immaturity of dendritic cells and/or marginal zone B cells.",

The absence of antibodies to A and B blood\u2014group substances in individuals expressing the respective blood groups represents a classical example. However, tolerance is imperfect, and antibodies against self-glycan structures can be present in healthy subjects. Infectious agents or vaccines expressing glycotopes structurally related to self glycans can elicit antibodies reactive with self antigens. For example, neutralizing antibodies elicited by an inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine cross-react with the human serum glycoprotein asialo-orosomucoid [15]. What is less clear is the role of self glycans in the positive selection of the B cell repertoire. A growing body of evidence indicates that positive selection occurs during murine\u2014B cell development [16] and can involve selection against the self glycoprotein Thy-1 [17]. The recent discovery of an endogenous CD1-restricted glycosphingolipid, isoglobotrihexosylceramide, suggests that self glycans may mediate the positive selection of T cells and/or NK cells [18].",

Coupling of protein is thought to convert glycotopes into T cell\u2014dependent immunogens. Immunization with PS protein\u2014conjugate vaccines likely involves activation of the follicular B cell population. Follicular B cells take up PS protein conjugates via their PS-specific B-cell receptor, process the carrier protein moieties, and present the resulting peptides on cell surface major histocompatibility complex class II molecules where they may engage peptide-specific T cells. PS-specific B cells thereby receive signals via cognate T cell\u2014B cell interactions and CD40-CD40L engagements that are sufficient for activation, differentiation into antibody secreting cells, germinal-center formation, class switch recombination, and somatic hypermutation. Memory B cells generated during this T cell\u2014dependent process can be activated by subsequent stimulation with either PS-protein conjugates or by multi-epitope PS.",

For example, Hib PS\u2014conjugate vaccines utilizing different carriers elicit distinct antibody populations, as has been discerned by idiotypic [19] and avidity analyses [20]. Furthermore, studies of humans indicate that both TH1 and TH2 cytokine responses are elicited following immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [21]. The outer membrane protein complex derived from Neisseria meningitidis is used as a carrier protein in some PS-conjugate vaccines. The Hib PS\u2014conjugate vaccine, having an outer membrane protein complex as the carrier, is uniquely capable of stimulating a serum anti-Hib PS\u2014antibody response in 2-month-old infants after a single immunization. In contrast, conjugates utilizing bacterial toxoids as carriers usually do not elicit significant seroconversion until the second immunization [22]. These properties of the outer membrane\u2014protein complex carrier may be related to its ability to engage Toll-like receptor\u20132 [23]. Thus, carrier proteins function not only as a source of peptide epitopes permitting the delivery of T cell help, but they also can possess mitogenic and adjuvant-like properties that stimulate the innate immune response.",

PS antigens, by nature of their multivalent, repeating glycotope structure, engage a sufficient number of B cell receptors that result in B cell activation and maturation to antibody secretion. The inability of PS immunization to lead to anamnestic responses suggests that memory B cells are not generated by this type of antigenic stimulation, presumably because of failure of the immunogen to associate with MHC-II molecules and recruit T cell help. Although B cell activation by TI-2 antigens can occur independently of T cells, it is becoming increasingly clear that accessory signals, in addition to those generated by B cell\u2014receptor cross-linking, are required to generate antibody responses to TI-2 antigens. In vitro, highly purified B cells do not respond to TI-2 antigens. Accessory cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, and costimulatory signals are required for an effective response to TI-2 antigens. In addition, many TI-2 antigens are able to fix complement, and the formation of these complexes in vivo could facilitate B cell activation by providing costimulation through complement receptors. Engagement of the complement receptor lowers the antigen signaling threshold for B cell activation [27], and the coupling of complement C3d fragments enhances PS immunogenicity [28]. Several molecules\u2014such as the transmembrane activator and its ligand B lymphocyte stimulator, tyrosine kinase Pyk-2, Bruton tyrosine kinase, and phospholipase C-\u03b32\u2014have been identified as costimulatory signals and/or receptors necessary for the generation of antibody responses to TI-2 antigens (reviewed in [29]). Understanding the mechanisms by which these molecules exert their effects will not only suggest new ways to enhance responses to carbohydrate-based vaccines, but also new ways to suppress autoimmune responses directed against self glycans.",

The majority of older children and adults possess serum antibodies specific to a plethora of bacterial capsular glycotopes, and these antibodies mediate protective immunity. Presumably, exposure to the homologous organism or to organisms expressing cross-reacting glycotopes drives the formation of these antibodies. These natural antibodies appear to derive from memory B cells, because molecular analyses of adult pneumococcal antibodies show that they have undergone both a class switch and hypermutation [31\u201333]. These findings suggest that exposure to glycotopes presented in the context of the bacterial surface generates both PS-specific B cell antibody secretion and memory development. In mice, CD4+ T cells and engagement of the Toll-like receptor\u20132 and its adaptor protein, MyD88, have been implicated in the response to pneumococcal glycotopes elicited by intact bacteria [34]. Unlike conjugate vaccination, which usually occurs by the intramuscular route, natural exposure occurs predominantly across mucosal surfaces. Thus, understanding the induction of natural immunity and the maintenance of the carrier state must take into account the migration patterns between secondary lymphoid tissues and the homeostatic mechanisms operating at mucosal surfaces [29].",

As discussed above, follicular B cells are probably the major subset activated by PS-protein conjugates, whereas blood-borne bacteria and PS antigens are thought to stimulate marginal-zone B cells (and B-1 B cells in the mouse) [35, 36]. Marginal-zone B cells differ from follicular B cells in their rapid proliferative response and elaboration of IgM antibodies early in the course of bacterial infection, and it has been suggested that these B cells represent an innate-like response that mediates immediate immunity before the slower adaptive response has developed [35]. Human marginal-zone B cells express high levels of CD1c, which suggests that they might be well suited for presentation of bacterially derived lipid antigens. In humans, there is a subpopulation of circulating B cells that have the phenotype of marginal-zone B cells. These cells have been designated \u201cIgM memory B cells\u201d because they express both cell-surface IgM and the memory cell marker CD27. The V genes of peripheral blood IgM memory B cells are mutated [37], and a recent report indicates that these cells are mobilized in response to PS vaccination [38]. IgM memory B cells with mutated V genes are present in patients with hyper IgM syndrome who lack functional CD40\u2014CD40 ligand interactions [39]. This finding has prompted the suggestion that 2 pathways of somatic hypermutation exist in humans: the traditional pathway dependent on T cells and CD40 receptor\u2014CD40L receptor interactions, and another pathway independent of CD40 receptor-CD40L receptor interactions [39].",

[40] that antibody-combining sites recognizing glycotopes can exist as either shallow grooves or as deep clefts, with the former binding internal epitopes expressed along the length of the glycan polymer and the latter binding to epitopes on the nonreducing ends of the glycan chain. Some glycotopes are expressed by short oligomers, whereas others require longer chain lengths for expression. Studies of the type 14 pneumococcal PS have shown that the induction of osponically active antibodies is critically dependent on chain length and the expression of a conformational epitope [41]. Similarly, the protective glycotope of type III group B streptococcal PS is a conformationally dependent, helical structure requiring extended chain lengths for expression [42]. Thus, antibodies prepared against short oligomeric glycotopes may show the requisite antigen-binding specificity, but they may not recognize native capsular glycotopes and mediate protection. This issue is particularly important in the design of vaccines using synthetic oligosaccharides.",

Two combining sites constitute the traditional site created by the association of variable heavy and light chain domains, and 2 additional sites are created by domain exchange at the VH-VH interface. This capability for multivalent interaction provides a structural explanation for the high avidity of this antibody.

Numerous reports have shown that peptides binding to carbohydrate combining sites can be isolated from peptide libraries [reviewed in 50]. These peptides show apparent specificity in that their binding is peptide-sequence dependent but is usually limited to the combining site against which they were selected. A fundamental issue is whether these mimetics, when presented in an immunogenic form, are able to elicit carbohydrate-specific antibody responses. Some studies suggest that this, indeed, is the case. Peptide mimics have been shown to induce cross-reactive responses to carbohydrate antigens expressed on bacteria [51, 52], fungi [53], HIV envelope protein [54], and tumor cells [55], to name a few. In a mouse-tumor challenge model, immunization with a DNA construct encoding a mimetic inhibited tumor growth [56] and antimimotope antibodies block cell adhesion of HIV gp120\u2014expressing cells and human dendritic cells [57]. One could imagine a number of advantages of using peptidyl mimics rather than glycotopes. These include the ease of synthesis and purification, the ability to be formulated in a variety of ways not amenable to glycotopes, such as multiple antigen peptides and DNA vaccines [58], and the ability to engage cellular processing and activation pathways not normally within the capability of glycotopes.",

Functional and structural studies of glycopeptide antigens have demonstrated that MHC molecules tether the glycopeptide by binding the peptidyl moiety in the MHC-binding pocket, such that the glycotope can directly engage the T cell receptor. Cytotoxic T cell responses to carbohydrate antigens can be induced by immunization with either naturally occurring or synthetic glycopeptides [62, 63].",

CD1 molecules, which exist in multiple isoforms, are structurally related to MHC class I molecules. Examples of CD1-restricted antigens include mycobacterial glycolipids and the self-derived ganglioside GM1. The T cells recognizing CD1-presented lipid antigens may utilize a variety of T cell receptor\u2013\u03b1 and T cell receptor\u2013\u03b2 chains. In addition, NK cells expressing an invariant T cell receptor\u2013\u03b1 chain paired with various \u03b2 chains (in both mouse and man) also are CD1-restricted, and they recognize a glycosphingolipid known as \u03b1-galactosylceramide, a glycolipid originally identified in marine sponges. \u03b1-Galactosylceramide binds with high affinity to CD1d and has potent immunoregulatory properties. Administration of \u03b1-galactosylceramide induces production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 and activates NK cells, T cells, and B cells. A synthetic analogue of \u03b1-galactosylceramide has potent protective activities in murine models of malaria and melanoma. CD-1 restricted T cells may produce either TH1-type or TH1/TH2\u2014type cytokine responses that could be important in antitumor and antimicrobial immune responses. Although the precise role of CD1-restricted T cells in adaptive immune responses requires further study, some evidence suggests that CD1-restricted NKT cells are involved in immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas auruginosa, Plasmodium yoelii, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Francisella tularensis (reviewed in [64, 65]).",

This work originated from earlier studies demonstrating that PS-specific CD4+ T cells were involved in protection against sepsis caused by B. fragilis [67]. The capsular PS of B. fragilis (and some pneumococcal capsules) is zwitterionic and forms a helical structure. The PS is capable of inducing protective PS-specific T cells in an antigen presenting cell-dependent fashion, and this effect depends on the zwitterionic character of the PS. The B. fragilis PS is processed by antigen presenting cells via an endosomal-lysozomal pathway that involves chemical cleavage by a nitric oxide\u2014mediated mechanism that generates low\u2014molecular weight carbohydrates capable of binding to MHC-II and being presented to CD4+ T cells. Given the diversity of glycan structures and their chemical contexts, it is likely that additional carbohydrate-processing pathways will be discovered. For example, the C-type lectin, known as specific intracellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin\u2014R1 (SIGN-R1), which is expressed on splenic marginal-zone macrophages, binds with high affinity to the pneumococcal type 14 capsular PS and mediates uptake of type 14 pneumococci [68].",
