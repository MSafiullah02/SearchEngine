It then compares the sequences in the new PSI-BLAST result with the ReHAB hits database to identify new matches resulting from recently deposited sequences. The complete ReHAB hits database can then be queried by date using a simple GUI to allow the researcher to easily identify new hits; these are highlighted, and pairwise or multiple alignments can be performed to assess the quality of the match.

This is particularly true for large viruses like poxviruses, baculoviruses, and herpesviruses that possess many virulence genes that are not part of the core set of genes that define a virus family [3] . There are also numerous core genes for which no known function has yet been identified; for example, of 49 completely conserved protein families in poxviruses, there are 11 with completely unknown function and at least 5 others with only poorly defined function.",

Each of these components is described in more detail below.

To reduce the amount of required storage space, actual alignments are not stored, but are regenerated for presentation when the user selects the specific query sequence or query-target pair to be viewed.

PSI-BLAST is performed for three iterations without filtering procedures (such as for low-complexity regions). Hits with an E-value less than 0.001 are used to generate the scoring matrix for the subsequent cycle. To increase speed, searches with query sequences that result in no new hits are terminated after the first cycle. Those with new hits scoring below the threshold continue to the third cycle. PSI-BLAST was chosen because it is a more sensitive search method than BLASTP. The searches do not need to be performed on the same machine on which the database or server components are installed. XML output from blastpgp is parsed and relevant information about each hit is stored in the ReHAB database. In addition to scores and identifying information, target sequences are copied into the ReHAB database to ensure that they are available for analysis in the future, even if they are no longer available from NCBI. This is important because, although NCBI does not actually remove sequences from its database, it may change the identifier of a sequence if it is corrected, updated, or merged with another identical entry. Any changes to a pre-existing entry are added to the database, but it is not registered as a new hit.",

These sequences are used to query the NR NCBI protein database and a MySQL database of all hits is generated and stored ( Figure 2 ). Databases of hits for other virus families maintained by The Virus Bioinformatics Resource (TVBR; herpesviruses, baculoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses) will also be available in the near future. The hits database can then be accessed by double-clicking on the database name or by selecting \"browse by organism\" in the Action menu. This opens a new window to present browsing, sorting, and highlighting options ( Figure 3 ). The user can browse by organism name, such as \"Variola Virus strain Bangladesh-1975\". To highlight recent hits, the \"date option\" is chosen to define the date after which the hits are considered new. The available dates are those on which the query sequences were searched against a then current NR NCBI database. The output can be sorted based on three criteria (name, new hit date, or maximum new hit bit-score) by selecting the appropriate radio button. The results are presented in a new window, using colors to indicate new hits (Figure 4 ). Figure 2 ReHAB management console.

The pairwise alignment can be displayed rapidly by clicking on the score (a hyperlink). In contrast to the usual BLAST output, which presents the local alignment found by BLAST, a global alignment produced by Needle [12, 13] is shown. More information can be obtained about the target sequence by clicking on the link to the NCBI file for that entry. Alternatively, a full list of hits can be viewed in the \"Hits Manager\" window ( Figure 5b) . Here, sequences can be sorted by highlight, and pairwise or multiple alignments can be performed. Pairwise alignments are displayed by selecting a single target sequence and clicking the \"Global\" button for global alignments produced by the EMBOSS program Query sequences with new hits are highlighted Figure 4 Query sequences with new hits are highlighted. A user defined threshold (in the Browser window) is used to define the minimum bit-score that is highlighted in red, and all new hits with lower scores are highlighted in yellow. The Latest Hit column indicates the date of the most recent hit. Those with no entry in this column have no hits in the database (for example, VARV-Bsh-A33.5L). Sorting of the entries can be changed by clicking on the column heading. Details about the hits can be obtained by right-clicking on the entry or selecting an option in the Action menu.

However, these sequences and their alignments with the query can still be visualized in the HTML Report and Hits Manager windows, thus allowing the user to access all the available information. This feature becomes essential when new poxvirus genomes are added to the public database, since a large fraction of the queries will hit proteins in the new genome and signal a \"new hit\" report when there may be no other new hits in the database. Although these are clearly high scoring matches, they are expected and therefore must be masked in the analysis if the full value of ReHAB is to be realized.",
