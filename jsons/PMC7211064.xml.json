On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared a pandemic, with 118 326 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths reported1 with a case mortality rate of 3.6%2 whereas the mortality can reach 62% for critical patients and 81% for those requiring mechanical ventilation.3 A report from the Italian Superior Institute of Health based on 3200 patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 has related mortality to elderly age and other active comorbidities including cancer.4 Patients had a median age of 80 (range 38\u2013100 years), a relevant increase in the mortality occurred after 70 years (from 2.7% in patients aged 60\u201369 years to 9.6% in those 70\u201379 years and 16.6%\u201319% in those more than 80 years). 19.4% were patients with cancer; other active comorbidities were: hypertension (76.5%), cardiac ischaemic disease (37.3%), diabetes (37.3%), atrial fibrillation (26.5%) and chronic renal insufficiency (17.5%). The presence of two or three of these comorbidities was associated with 25.7% and 47% of deaths, respectively.4 To date, no effective treatment has been identified. Management for patients who are critically ill relies on management in intensive care units. Global health organisations are scurrying to implement preventive measures, aiming to limit transmission, through public safety measures and restrictions. In Italy and the UK, as in some other countries, recommendations aimed at limiting access of patients with cancer and their caregivers to the hospital and prioritising curative treatments have been provided by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, respectively.5 6\n",
