Its etiological agent has been convincingly identified as a new member of family Coronaviridae (SARS-CoV). It causes serious damage to the respiratory system yet the mechanism is not clear. Infection-induced apoptosis or necrosis is suspected but no direct evidence for this yet exists. To date, Vero E6 cells are the only cell line that could be used to replicate the virus with obvious CPE (cytopathic effect) in vitro. It is known for some viruses (including members of family Coronaviridae) that CPE can be caused either by virus-induced apoptosis (active death) or cell necrosis (passive death). In this study, we examined the apoptosis in the SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Indeed, the results do show that the CPE was induced by apoptosis rather than necrosis, shown by typical DNA fragmentation, through the existence of apoptotic bodies and swollen mitochondria. This observation has some implications for the SARS-CoV pathogenicity: SARS-CoV does induce apoptosis in cell cultures and might have the same effect in vivo, responsible for the severe damage of the respiratory system.",

It has also been shown that its genomic sequence is unrelated to any known coronaviruses isolated either from humans or animals though a closely-related virus has been isolated recently from some wild animals, e.g., civet cat [Guan et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003] . The disease has been reproduced in monkeys, therefore the Koch's postulates was fulfilled by proxy . Currently, the virus biology, pathogenesis, pathogenicity and preventive measures, including vaccine development, are under detailed scrutiny. It is as yet unclear why such an acute virus infection becomes so severe and why the respiratory system is heavily damaged, causing patients a fatal consequence.",

This was first observed from work on an adenovirus in 1981 [Pilder et al., 1984] . Apoptosis is an active and physiological type of cell death, which is different fundamentally from necrosis (passive accidental death) [White, 1996; Peter et al., 1997] . It is characterised morphologically by nuclear fragmentation and cellular breakdown into apoptotic bodies [Kerr et al., 1972] and biochemically by chromosomal DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosomes [Wyllie, 1998] . It can be induced either directly by the virus itself to assist virus dissemination, or by triggering inadvertently cellular sensors that initiate cell death [O'Brien, 1998; Koyama et al., 2000] . No matter what mechanism is involved, virus-induced apoptosis is recognised as a normal response in the virus-infected cells, but in general could be detrimental to the host, e.g., the influenza virus damages epithelial cells in the human and animal respiratory tracts through apoptosis [Hinshaw et al., 1994; Julkunen et al., 2001; Ito et al., 2002; Brydon et al., 2003; Lowy, 2003] , leading to the respiratory system failure. Apoptosis is a common event in lytic viral infection [Shen and Shenk, 1995; O'Brien, 1998 ]. As SARS-CoV is observed as an acute lytic infection [Drosten et al., 2003a; Fouchier et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2003] , apoptosis-induced cell damage might be responsible for the severe clinical manifestations.",

This implies that SARS-CoV could be a proapoptotic agent. Therefore, we examined the apoptotic effect of SARS-CoV in the in vitro cell line, Vero E6 cells, which is the only CPE-induced cell line for SARS-CoV available to date. The results show that SARS-CoV induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells is evident due to the observed DNA fragmentation, existence of apoptotic body and swollen mitochondria. This might explain why SARS-CoV induces respiratory epithelial cell damage similar to that observed in influenza infection through apoptosis. The mechanism under which the apoptosis occurs and its effect on the SARS patients, could lead to a greater future understanding of its pathology.",

To test whether the cell damage and death are due to induction of apoptosis, the presence of fragmented chromosome DNA in SARS-CoV-infected cells were examined. Vero E6 is the only cell line to support the SARS-CoV replication with obvious CPE. In this study, Vero E6 cells were mock infected or were infected with SARS-CoV-WHU, and were subsequently harvested at different time point p.i. Genomic DNA was purified as described in ''Materials and Methods'' and was resolved in 2% agarose gels (Fig. 1) . DNA fragmentation was seen in Vero E6 cells from 24 hr p.i. Increased amount of fragmented DNA was detected with longer infection times, suggesting that SARS-CoV induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. The fragments formed a typical apoptotic ladder in the gel, with most of the DNA accumulated in the lower bands at 48 and 72 hr p.i. No fragmentation phenomenon was detected in uninfected cells (Fig. 1) .",

The characteristic CPE of SARS-CoV infection in vitro for Vero E6 is cellular round-up and shrinking without production of syncytia (Fig. 2 , column A). Infection (Fig. 2, column B) could be detected as early as 12 hr after infection, but no apparent CPE and apoptosis was observed (condensed nuclei) (Fig. 2 , column C). Most of the cells were infected as shown with indirect immunofluorescence staining 24 hr after infection but only a few cells (about 5%) developed CPE and nuclei with condensed chromatin (Fig. 2, 3rd row) . More cells (about 16%) showed CPE and nuclei with condensed chromatin 48 hr p.i. (Fig. 2, 4th row) . Most of the infected cells underwent CPE and shrinkge 72 hr p.i., in which almost all cells with CPE contained nuclei with condensed chromatin, or fragmentation into apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2, 5th row) . Detection of cells developing nuclei with condensed chromatin, or fragmentation into apoptotic bodies increased with linger infection times (Fig. 3) . This result illustrates that apoptotic cells can also be infected with the SARS-CoV.",

Figure 4 illustrates changes in DNA content distribution in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells at different time point p.i. The histograms of DNA content frequency distribution clearly indicates that the SARS-CoV infection results in the appearance of cells with a fractional DNA content, which was defined as ''sub-G 1 '' peak, 24 hr p.i. Furthermore, as the infection progressed, the percentage of cells in sub-G 1 was increased accordingly. This is typical characteristic of apoptosis rather than necrosis.",

As observed in our study, SARS-CoV replicates while cells undergoing apoptosis. This is consistent with some other previous observations, e.g., some animal viruses can produce considerable amounts of progeny virus in ongoing apoptotic cells [O'Brien, 1998; Koyama et al., 2000] . SARS-CoV was also observed in macrophages or T cells and infection of these cells were suspected [Lang et al., 2003; O'Donnell et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003] . The apoptotic cells are subjected to phagocytosis by macrophages, therefore it is possible for the SARS virus seen in macrophages to be the consequence of phagocytosis of the apoptotic infected cells by macrophages. This needs to be addressed further in the future.",

Therefore, apoptosis can have two opposite roles on the pathogenicity of viral infection, enhancing or suppressing the infection. In the case of SARS, as observed in human patients [Lang et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003] , the apoptosis occurs massively, thus SARS-CoV induced apoptosis would certainly have a deleterious pathogenic role in the patients, leading to severe tissue damage. This might be one of the explanations of the serious nature of SARS infection as observed in clinics. In most cases of animal virus-induced apoptosis, enhancing infection and detrimental effects are common [Shen and Shenk, 1995; Hardwick, 1997; O'Brien, 1998; Everett and McFadden, 1999; Koyama et al., 2000] . Though killing off the infected cells might be a mechanism for the body to limit the spread of the virus, it is still detrimental if the lung cells are destroyed.",

It has been shown that in other coronaviruses, e.g., avian infectious bronchitis virus [Liu et al., 2001] and swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus [Eleouet et al., 2000] , that apoptosis is induced by a caspase-dependent mechanism. Similar mechan-ism could exist for SARS-CoV-induced apoptosis and should be considered for future work. It is also essential to understand the relationships between apoptosis in vivo and the severe outcome of SARS-CoV infection in the human population in order for the rational design of clinical medical treatment strategy.
