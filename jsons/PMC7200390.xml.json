Current WHO guidelines suggest that once COVID-19 infection is suspected, control measures should be immediately implemented and public health officials notified. However, following current public health official guidelines only a minority of population has already been tested for SARS-CoV-2, mainly due to the reduced availability of these tests.32\n,\n33 Commonly used tests require several hours for the results and therefore cannot provide useful information for the management of stroke patients in the ER setting. Consequently, to assess the likelihood of infection, risk factors for COVID-19 disease should be taken into consideration. Even if diagnostic criteria are still debated, WHO clinical criteria for pursuing COVID-19 diagnostic evaluation are commonly used. According to WHO,32 COVID-19 should be considered in patients with fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea) who have had any of the following in the prior 14 days:1Close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately two meters of a patient for a prolonged time or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).2Residence in (or travel to) areas where widespread community transmission has been reported.3Potential exposure through attendance at events where COVID-19 cases have been reported.\n",
