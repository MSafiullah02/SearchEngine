The site contains six adjoining 12.1\u2010ha, cool\u2010season grass pastures bisected by a 141\u2010m reach of a perennial flowing stream. Soils at the study site were classified as Ackmore (fine\u2010silty, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aeric Fluvaquent) and Nodaway (fine\u2010silty, mixed, nonacid, mesic Mollic Udifluvent) silt loams. The pastures primarily contained a mixture of smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.) and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), with lesser amounts of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), and legumes. Pastures were not fertilized during the study or for at least three grazing seasons before the study.",

Treatments included continuous stocking with unrestricted stream access (CSU), continuous stocking with stream access restricted to 4.9\u2010m\u2010wide stabilized crossings (CSR), or rotational stocking (RS). In the CSR treatment, cattle were not allowed access to the streamside buffer (\u223c0.91 ha), which reached approximately 33 m on either side of the stream. Pastures in the RS treatment were divided into a five\u2010paddock rotation, with four upland paddocks (2.78 ha) and a single riparian paddock (0.91 ha). Upland paddocks were grazed for a maximum of 14 d or until half of the forage was estimated to be removed as measured by a falling plate meter (Haan et al., 2007). The falling plate meter provides an estimate for standing live forage mass based on its height when a 0.25\u2010m2 (4.8 kg m\u22122) square plexiglass sheet is place on top of the grass. Riparian paddocks were grazed for a maximum of 4 d or to a minimum sward height of 10 cm (Clary and Leininger, 2000) as measured by the falling plate meter. This experiment and pasture treatments and data related to the temporal and spatial distribution of the grazing cattle have been described previously (Haan et al., 2010; Schwarte et al., 2010). Data related to characteristics of the riparian area and stream bank erosion in these pastures during the first 3 yr of the study were reported by Nellesen et al. (2011). The rainfall\u2013runoff simulation experiment described here was conducted beginning in 2008, during the fourth and fifth years of experimental treatments at this site.",

Application water, derived from municipal water, was filtered through a 0.45\u2010\u03bcm sediment filter, and precipitation was applied for 1.5 h at a rate of 8.4 cm h\u22121 to simulate a storm with a 100\u2010yr recurrence (Huff and Angel, 1992). At 10\u2010min intervals, the amounts of precipitation and runoff were recorded, and runoff was subsampled and added to a composite sample for each simulation. At the end of each simulation, subsamples of the composited sample were taken for analysis of sediment, P, bovine enteric viruses, and E. coli O157:H7. Application water was sampled daily for baseline levels of P, bovine enteric viruses, and E. coli O157:H7. Water samples were stored in coolers until transport to the laboratory.

Forage mass was determined by hand\u2010clipping an adjacent 0.25\u2010m2 area with the same sward height as the rainfall site to a stubble height of 2.5 cm (Haan et al., 2006). Surface roughness was measured as the standard deviation of the length of adjacent pins on a 41\u2010pin meter with a length of 2 m (Betteridge et al., 1999). Proportions of bare and fecal\u2010covered ground were determined by counting the number of pins from the pin meter that contacted bare or fecal\u2010covered ground (Betteridge et al., 1999).

Because the application rates during the simulations were 8.4 cm h\u22121, these run\u2010off values should represent a near\u2013worst\u2010case scenario. Linear regressions were used because quadratic equations did not improve the correlation coefficients. Amounts of daily precipitation throughout the entire grazing season of both years were entered into the regression equation at the nearest date to calculate predicted runoff from each site class from a 0.5\u2010m2 area of land. These runoff quantity data were multiplied by the means of the sediment and P concentrations in the runoff of each rainfall simulation site class, weighted for the volume from each simulation, to yield the predicted amounts of sediment and P transported from each site class during a runoff event based on a 0.5\u2010m2 area of land. Mean sediment and P transported within 0.5\u2010m2 sites of each site class of a pasture were multiplied by the amount of land in that site class within 4.6 m of the stream to calculate the total amounts of sediment and P transported in runoff from the stream bank within each pasture in each month of each grazing season. Although rainfall simulations could not be conducted on the stabilized stream crossings, P and sediment loads in runoff from these areas were calculated using concentrations and rates from the CSUbare site class and multiplied by the area of bank covered with the stabilized crossing to account for sediment and P loading of the runoff from these stream crossings. Previously, runoff from stabilized sites on 3% slopes with rainfall intensities of 50 mm h\u22121 have been reported to be approximately half of that from bare ground (Singh et al., 2008). Therefore, sediment and P loads in runoff from the CSUbare site class were halved to calculate the sediment and P loss per m2. Annual sediment and P transported in runoff during the grazing season of each year were calculated as the sum of the amounts of sediment and P transported monthly.",
