The highest and lowest figure for each herbarium specimen was then recorded. In 4 species and the R. hugonislR. xanthina assemblage, the number of specimens examined was large enough for meaningful histograms to be drawn (Pig. 4) showing numbers of spccimens in cach class of leaflet number. Modal classcs for highest numbers of leaflets were the same in R . sericea, R . spinosissima, and R . hugonis/R. xanthina, as also werc the modal classes for the lowest numbers. In R . omeiensis, the divergence between the modal classes of highest and lowest numbcrs of leaflcts is greater than in any of the other species. This might be a conscquence of thc generally higher values exhibited allowing more flexibility in numbers of leaflets. The arbitrary designations of distributions 1, 2 and 3 are used in Table 1 to distinguish the three types of distribution which were found. $ Only one living plant of R . forrestiana was available for examination. Its flowers had broad discs, t o which the filaments were partly fused, and its stamcns were consequently incapable of inflexion. As this character could only be satisfactorily studied on living material and in the absence of further information, an entry of 'no comparison' was made against this species in Table 2. * * Oval hips and short styles werc found together in the same species, so usually were globose hips and long styles. Style length was recorded shortly after the flowers opened, while the receptacle was at an early stage of development, and the hip was not recognisably globose or oval. ThereEorc the 'length of style' is not geometrically dependent on hip shape, i.e. thcy are not 'neccssary corrclates' in the sense of Sokal & Sneath (1963) .

Coefficients of Association were calculated between all pairs of species, and are shown in Table 3 , where they are expressed as percentages, t o the nearest whole number. Each coefficient is the ratio of the number of character states two species have in common to the total number of characters on which they were compared, and is therefore an estimate of the degree of similarity between the species.

In only two plants, R . sericea and R . omeiensis, were no multivalents recorded. Studies in the genus Oenothera, reviewed by Cleland (1962) , have shown that chromosomes in multivalent associations may be so oriented at metaphase I of meiosis, as to ensure an ordered segregation at anaphase I, leading t o the formation of balanced gametes. However, such a mechanism demands a regularity in the formation of multivalents and an alternate configuration of chromosomes at metaphase I, neither of which were evident in any of the plants discussed here. Thus it might be anticipated that in each of the plants with multivalent associations a proportion of segregants would be unbalanced and that this would result in the production of unbalanced gametes. However, this expectation was not borne out by studies of pollen and seed, as several plants in which multivalents were found compare favourably with R. sericca and R. omeiensis with respect t o viability of pollen and/or numbers of seed per hip (Table 4) . Furthermore, as multivalents were found in five out of the seven diploid species examined in this investigation and as Erlanson (1933) has reported multivalents in plants of wild origin of R. blanda, R. woodsii and R. pisocarpa it seems that natural selection does not rigorously eliminate translocation mutants in natural populations of roses. The only immediate conclusion that can be drawn from them is entirely negative: the appearance of multivalent associations in the hybrids constitutes neither proof that the genomes of the parent species have diverged significantly during evolution, nor evidence that gene flow between the parent species would be restricted.",

A study of meiosis in an F, hybrid between the presumed monophyletic groups of diploid species would have helped t o clarify this issue and it is unfortunate that such a hybrid was not available in this investigation. The irregularity of meiosis and consequent sterility of R. foetida indicate that neither of the alternative assumptions made for the evolution of R. spinosissima applies in this species. In view of its sterility it is pertinent to record comments written on herbarium sheets by collectors of specimens kept at the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Two collectors in Iraq stated, respectively, that this species was grown as a hedge plant and that petals were used in making jam. A collector in Turkey commented on its popularity in gardens and as a hedge plant and another stated that he had not seen it growing wild and doubted if it did. These observations indicate that R . foetida is a popular domestic plant and may be either rare or non-existent in the wild condition.

As R. sericea and R. omeiensis have been united, it would be consistent t o unite R. primula with R . ecae and R. hugonis with R . xanthina. No evidence of sterility barriers between R. Jirimula and R. ecae emerged from studies on the two F, hybrids R. primula x R. ecae 40.57.A. and 40.57.B., or between R. hugonis and R. xanthina from studies of the F, hybrid R. hugonis x R. xanthina 8B.56., so no a priori argument can be advanced against uniting the species of either pair. Although the evidence presented accords with Rowley's decision to unite R. omeiensis with R . sericea",

Most flowers were imperfectly preserved, and it was not always possible t o distin;uish them on the basis of their diameter. The two species could not be distinpished on number and shape of leaflets alone, as they overlap considerably in both characters. Although living specimens can be distinguished, only one plant of each species was available in the collection at Reading. It was therefore decided, for the Distribution maps were compiled on the basis of the above records. The distributions of R . omeiensis, R. sericea, R. ecae and R. primula are shown inFig. 1, those of R. hugonis/R. xanthina, R. koreuna and R . forrestiana are shown inFig. 2, and those of R.
