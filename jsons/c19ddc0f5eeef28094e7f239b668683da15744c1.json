Infection occurred in a winter-spring seasonal pattern similar to that reported previously (9, 11) while the pattern of prevalence over successive years suggested this agent might circulate annually in urban populations with seasons of accentuated prevalence at two-to three-year intervals. Infection was associated with acute respiratory illness clinically indistinguishable from that caused by other common respiratory viruses, and serologically followed by persistently elevated neutralizing and transiently elevated CF antibody titers.

However, within the coronavirus group, neither the number of human respiratory immunotypes nor the extent of their serologic cross-reactivity are fully known. An antigenic relationship has been demonstrated by CF and HI tests between certain members such as OC 38/43 and MHV, and other less well defined CF cross-reactions may exist within the group (7, 17) . However, a common group antigen such as is found in the adeno and influenza viruses has not been demonstrated. In the case of 229E, studies with hyperimmune an-imal sera have revealed no clear evidence of CF cross-reactions between this virus and MHV, IBV and OC 38/43 (7, 17) .

If it is assumed that in these other years, as in 1966-1967, CF seroconversion identified most of the students with neutralizing antibody titer rises, it was the overall experience that seroconversion to 229E occurred twice as often by the CF as by the neutralizing antibody test.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SEASONAL PATTERN OF 229E INFECTIONS"}, {"text": "This difference in CF and neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates could not be entirely accounted for by the decision that 2x CF rises were significant. Although students with 2x CF titer rises showed concomitant neutralizing antibody seroconversion less frequently than those with >4x CF titer rises, 2x reactors appeared to relate to 5?4X reactors as the lower end of a continuum in which the frequency of neutralizing antibody seroconversion was directly related to the extent of CF antibody titer rise. This was true in each of the high prevalence seasons, and in the overall experience the portion of CF reactors with concomitant neutralizing antibody rises was 35, 45 and 78 per cent of students with 2x, 4X and ^8X CF rises, respectively. It should also be noted that 2X and ^4x rises were similar in respect to seasonal distribution and the relation of seroconversion to illness.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SEASONAL PATTERN OF 229E INFECTIONS"}, {"text": "Thus, either (or both) lesser specificity or greater sensitivity of the CF test also contributed to the difference in CF and neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates. The observations made in these studies do not provide the basis for a clear choice between these alternatives. Infection with other virus (es) cross-reacting with 229E by CF at low titer could be postulated as the origin of the small number of exclusively 2x CF rises that were seen in low frequency seasons, but this would not account for the observation that three of 12 students with CF rises under these circumstances had concomitant neutralizing antibody titer rises to 229E. A similar explanation could be proposed for the finding that pre-existing neutralizing antibody was associated with a diminished frequency of seroconversion by the neutralization test but did not influence the frequency of seroconversion by the CF test. However, if the CF seroconversions in students with high levels of 229E neutralizing antibody in their pre-infection serum were due to infection with one or more other viruses having CF cross-reactivity with 229E, it must be further assumed that something acted to restrict infection rates with the same agents in students with low levels of 229E neutralizing antibody. Otherwise, it might be expected that the latter group of students, subject to infection with 229E as well as the hypothesized cross-reacting agents, would have shown higher CF seroconversion rates than the students subject to infection only by the cross-reacting viruses. The CF seroconversion rates observed were, if anything, lower in students with low levels of pre-infection neutralizing antibody. That different agents would show such nicely reciprocal infection rates seems somewhat improbable.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SEASONAL PATTERN OF 229E INFECTIONS"}, {"text": "It is, however, also possible that the CF test is almost or indeed as specific as the neutralizing antibody test and, where serum specimens are closely spaced, considerably more sensitive. Immunologic factors related to the transient elevation of CF antibody and persistent elevation of neutralizing antibody following infection could play a role in this. The adverse effect of high levels of pre-infection antibody on the serodiagnosis of streptococcal and poliovirus infection has previously been commented upon (18) (19) (20) . In the case of 229E, long persisting neutralizing antibody may diminish the likelihood that the antigenic stimulus of reinfection will evoke a measureable rise in titer of this antibody while this would not be the case with the CF antibody response. Indeed, if it is assumed that at least a portion of the antibody reacting in the CF test is produced by a segment of the immune system that can develop persisting sensitization, past infection would actually serve to enhance the frequency of measureable CF response to reinfection. \u2022 There is not yet sufficient information about the human respiratory coronavimses to determine the extent to which sensitivity, specificity or both factors account for the observed differences in neutralizing and CF antibody seroconversion rates. Even so certain conclusions can be drawn from the results of the CF survey about the overall role of these viruses in acute respiratory illnesses of humans. Whether in response to infection with only 229E or infection with one or more other serotypes of coronaviruses, CF antibody titer rises to 229E occurred in all six seasons of these studies and were significantly related to acute respiratory illnesses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 514, "end": 518, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 519, "end": 523, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 524, "end": 528, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SEASONAL PATTERN OF 229E INFECTIONS"}, {"text": "If the twofold greater CF than neutralizing antibody seroconversion rate is to be attributable to lesser specificity of the CF test, then among the human respiratory coronaviruses yet to be discovered there must be one or more that circulate widely and share CF antigens with 229E. However, if the difference in seroconversion rates is to be attributed to the factor of sensitivity, several other interesting considerations follow. First, in respect to reinfection, the nearly uniform rate of CF antibody seroconversion to 229E observed among individuals with high as well as low levels of pre-infection neutralizing antibody describes a dissociation between naturally acquired serum antibody and resistance to reinfection (under conditions of natural challenge) that is unusual. Although it has been shown that naturally acquired local respiratory tract antibody is a better predictor than serum antibody, of resistance to reinfection with parainfluenza (21, 22) and RS (23) viruses, a correlation has nevertheless been demonstrable between naturally acquired serum antibody and resistance to reinfection with influenza (24), parainfluenza (21, 22, 25) and rhinoviruses (26) . While the apparent dissociation of prechallenge neutralizing antibody and reinfection with 229E as measured by CF antibody seroconversion may simply be an extreme example of the fact that circulating antibody is only an indirect indicator of surface immunity, it could also be interpreted as suggesting that resistance to reinfection is particularly evanescent in the case of the human respiratory coronavirus. That many of the 229E infections were indeed reinfections was clear from both the virus isolation and the neutralizing antibody seroconversion data. Similar findings in respect to OC 43 have been described by Kaye et al. (12) who found that almost 50 per cent of children aged 10-14 years who developed HI seroconversions to OC 43 had pre-existing antibody titers of 1:10 or greater. It might also be emphasized here that not only seroconversion rates but also the frequency with which such seroconversions were illness associated were unaffected by the presence of pre-infection antibody in both the present studies of 229E and those of OC 43 (12) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 955, "end": 959, "text": "(21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 960, "end": 963, "text": "22)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1145, "text": "(21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1149, "text": "22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1153, "text": "25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1810, "end": 1814, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2237, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SEASONAL PATTERN OF 229E INFECTIONS"}, {"text": "An unusual aspect of the seroepidemiology of 229E, referred to above (11) , might also be explained on the basis of transience of CF antibody and the enhancement of this antibody response after reinfection. This is the failure to find CF antibody in the acute or convalescent serum specimens of either children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract illness, or those hospitalized for nonrespiratory tract disease, although such antibody was found in sera collected from adults with acute respiratory illness from the same general (but different specific) locale and time period. This could reflect the fact that 229E infections of young children are unusual, or at least seldom of severity that requires hospitalization. However, the experience with other viruses that cause acute respiratory disease in the general population such as influenza, parainfluenza, rhino and RS viruses is that they circulate among children as well as or to a greater extent than among adults (27, 28) . Suggesting that this may indeed also be true of 229E virus is the finding by Bradburne (8) of neutralizing antibody to this virus in the sera of eight of 32 children aged 0-5 years and serologic studies in this laboratory indicating a similar prevalence of 229E in the pre-school age group (29) .
