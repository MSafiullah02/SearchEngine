ApoD expression is also found increased in several neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, meningoencephalitis, dementia, motor neuron disease [11], Parkinson's disease [12], schizophrenia [13], [14], multiple sclerosis [15] and several animal models of neurodegenerative injuries [10]. Besides neuropathological situations, apoD expression is elevated in several cancers. This overexpression of apoD gene is observed particularly in differentiated tumours with low proliferation rate and several studies suggested the importance of cellular growth arrest as a triggering factor of apoD expression [16], [17], [18]. Effectively, in cultured cells, apoD expression is associated with cellular growth arrest, senescence and inflammation. In agreement with these facts, apoD is also upregulated in aging rats [19] and humans [20], [21] and this senescence characteristic, which is an irreversible growth-arrested state in contrary to quiescence, is also considered as a physiological mechanism capable of counteracting tumour proliferation [22], [23], [24], [25], [26].",

More precisely, we found that the Alternating Purine-Pyrimidine stretch (APP) and two Serum Responsive Elements (SRE-1 and -2) were the major determinants of growth arrest-induced apoD gene expression. The SRE is a 23-bp element with an inverted repeat of dyad symmetry [29]. Only the SRE1 of the apoD promoter contains a CArG-box core described as a 10-bp element with the consensus sequence CC(A/T)6GG. In many growth-related or immediate early genes, the CArG-box element is often in the vicinity of an Ets-Binding-Site (EBS) [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Detailed analysis of the apoD promoter also revealed the presence of an EBS and a Glucocorticoid Responsive Element (GRE) between the two SREs in the region \u2212514 to \u2212475 [28]. The EBS, with its central core sequence 5'-GGA(A/T)-3', is known to cooperate tightly with the SRE through the binding of several nuclear proteins, particularly the Serum Response Factor (SRF) and members of the E26 transforming specific (ETS) family which regulate several genes implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation [33], [34]. Also, the GRE is known to interact with the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor ligand-dependant transcription factor which recognizes the consensus sequence 5'-GGTACAnnnTGTTCT-3' [35].",

As the SREs in the region \u2212558 to \u2212179 were identified as major determinants of growth arrest-induced gene expression, we focused our study on this region of the promoter that contains the SRE1, EBS and GRE sites (Table 1\n). Here, we present the identification and the characterization of several nuclear proteins that bind the apoD promoter under normal and growth arrest conditions in NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells. Our results show that Parp-1, HnRNP-U, CBF-A, BUB-3, Kif4, APEX-1 and Ifi204 bind elements of the promoter. We also investigated the implication of MEK/ERK pathway in the regulation of the apoD gene expression. We demonstrate the implication of these nuclear factors in the modulation of the apoD promoter and that Parp-1, APEX-1 and ERK1/2 catalytic activities regulate positively the apoD gene expression in growth arrested-cells.",

In contrast, for Parp-1, 50 \u03bcg of nuclear extract were required in order to detect the supershift. Four bands could be detected but the two major (bands II and III) disappeared in favor of a supershifted band (Fig. 2A, arrow). Although, the binding specificity of these complexes was not verified in this experiment with cold oligonucleotide excess, the intensity of band IV was increased in the presence of 0.25 \u03bcg of Parp-1 specific antibodies and reduced progressively with increasing amounts of antibodies (0.5 to 2 \u03bcg).",

As expected, apoD mRNA expression was significantly induced in serum starvation conditions (Fig. 3\n). Expression levels of Parp-1 were also induced by 2.1-fold after 1 day of serum starvation and reached a peak at day 2 with a 3-fold induction to finally decrease until day 5. This induction was even stronger by Northern analysis (up to 9 fold at day 2). Ifi204 and APEX-1 were also induced after 2 days of serum starvation by respectively 2.8 and 1.8 fold. In contrast, Kif4 mRNA expression was downregulated after 2 days of serum starvation which is consistent with the fact that Kif4 was only detected on the apoD promoter in growth conditions (Fig. 1A).

These cysteines are known to be implicated in the redox activity of APEX-1 which modifies and modulates the activity of several transcription factors [47]. Lysines 6 and 7, located in the nuclear localization signal motif (NLS) and known to be acetylated by p300 were replaced by arginine (K6R/K7R). This double mutation abrogates the redox activity of APEX-1 without affecting its nuclear localization [48]. Finally, aspartic acid 218 which is known to be important for the endouclease and DNA-binding activities [49] was replaced by alanine (D218A). As shown in Fig. 4A, all these mutants were unable to transactivate the apoD promoter in growth arrest conditions in contrast with the wild type APEX-1. Interestingly, mutants C64A/C92A and K6R/K7R induced the proliferation of NIH/3T3 cells cultured in condition of serum starvation compare to the wild-type APEX-1 or the control (CTRL\u2212; empty vector) where the cells were maintained in a growth arrest state (Supplemental Fig.1). In addition, the Parp-1 deletion mutant lacking its catalytic domain (del-Parp-1) could no longer transactivate the apoD promoter indicating the importance of the catalytic function in the apoD promoter regulation. Furthermore, we tested the role of Parp-1 and HnRNP-U on the apoD expression using a siRNA approach. The pre-designed siRNAs used to block either HnRNP-U or Parp-1 inhibited their target gene expression by more than 80% up to 4 days under growth arrest (grey bars; Fig. 4B) and efficiently and specifically blocked apoD expression (grey bars; Fig. 4C).",

Complete inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in presence of U0126 was verified by western blot analysis (results not shown). Consistent with this result, upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected as early as 5 min after serum starvation without inhibitor, reached a peak at 15 min and decreased after 30 min (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, at 24 h post serum starvation, ERK1/2 were again phosphorylated. Moreover, in the presence of Parp-1 inhibitor, activation of ERK2, but not ERK1, is maintained after 15 min for up to 2 h (Fig. 5D).

Using a biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the SRE1, EBS and GRE elements of the apoD promoter, we were able to purify and identify several nuclear proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. Among these proteins, HnRNP-U and CBF-A (Fig.1A), which belong to the Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo-protein family, are also known to interact with elements in the promoter of several genes and to regulate their expression. Indeed, HnRNP-U is known as a transcriptional activator of Kruppel-like factor 2 gene [54] and of Osteopontine gene expression, which is also modulated by CBF-A [37]. CBF-A is also involved in the regulation of the Ha-ras gene expression [39]. The mRNA binding ability of these two proteins led us to speculate that they could be recruited at the promoter level and play a role in both the apoD mRNA expression and processing, in this context of growth arrest. All these different crucial roles of HnRNP-U may explain its ubiquitous gene expression profile in growth-arrested NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 3). Binding of HnRNP-U to the promoter was further demonstrated by EMSA (Fig. 2A). The addition of HnRNP-U antibodies specifically reduced the complex intensity. This interaction with the SRE1-EBS-GRE, whether direct or indirect, is in agreement with previous reports showing that HnRNP-U can play a role in gene regulation via its interaction with the GRE site located in the promoter of the tryptophan oxygenase gene [55] and therefore suggests that HnRNP-U might interact with the apoD promoter through the GRE binding site.",

Although, several studies have shown its implications in DNA repair pathways, its DNA-binding and catalytic activities are also implicated in transcription regulation [40], [56]. Despite the fact that Parp-1 is reported as a ubiquitous protein, we found that its gene expression is up-regulated in growth-arrested NIH/3T3 cells and we clearly demonstrated its binding to the apoD promoter, highlighting its importance in this stress condition. We were able to obtain a supershift by EMSA upon addition of a specific antibody coupled with the disappearance with the major bands II and III. Bands I and IV were very faint and detectable only when 50 \u03bcg of extracts were used. Both bands appeared more abundant in growth arrest conditions and seem specific since they disappeared in the presence of Parp-1 antibodies (Fig. 2A).",

The SRE was already reported to be able to form cruciforms which resemble the Holliday junction [59].

However, using the biotin pull-down approach followed by western blot analysis, we confirmed that these proteins effectively bind the region of the promoter containing the SRE1, EBS and GRE sites (Fig. 2B). Obviously, BUB-3 does not recognize the SRE1 since the protein still binds an oligo lacking the SRE1 or an oligo in which the SRE1 was mutated. It is worth mentioning that, by mutating the EBS, we also mutated the GRE as well as the SRE1 because these sites are superimposed (see Table 1). Moreover, BUB-3 did not modulate the apoD promoter (Fig. 4A) and the gene was not activated under growth arrest (Fig. 3).",

Kif4 is a member of the kinesin superfamily of proteins known to transport cargos of macromolecules along the microtubules of cells, such as membrane organelles, protein complexes and mRNAs [44], [62]. The Kif4 nuclear localization was shown to be regulated by its interaction with Parp-1 in juvenile neurons. In addition, Kif4 can repress Parp-1 enzymatic activity in the nucleus of NIH/3T3 cells in normal culture conditions [44]. Thus, the apoD gene expression could be modulated by the interaction of these two proteins. In our study, Parp-1 could not be purified in normal growth conditions suggesting that the possible interaction of Parp-1 and Kif4 in NIH/3T3 cells, reported by Midorikawa and collaborators [44], may inhibit Parp-1 binding on the apoD promoter. Therefore, the presence of Parp-1 on the apoD promoter in growth arrest conditions may be favored by both the down- and upregulation in gene expression of Kif4 and Parp-1, respectively (Fig. 3).",

            "text": "In contrast, APEX-1 binds the promoter but binding persists despite the mutations of each consensus sequence (Fig. 2B). However, the deletion of the SRE1 abolished the binding. This implies that APEX-1 probably binds the apoD promoter through a greater affinity for the mutated sequences or through the interaction with other proteins, such as Parp-1, that bind either the SRE1 or the EBS-GRE sites. APEX-1 is a multifunctional protein implicated in DNA repair through the base-excision repair (BER) pathway, where Parp-1 was also shown to be involved but more importantly, APEX-1 is well known for its role in transcription regulation through a redox activity. Indeed, the redox activity of APE1 was shown to modify and activate several stress-inducible transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-\u03baB, p53, Egr-1, CREB, ATF and HIF-1\u03b1 [47], [63]. The fact that APEX-1 gene expression was found induced in growth arrest conditions may also indicate its importance in such stress conditions (Fig. 1B). Also, APEX-1 was shown to be induced in several stresses such as oxidative conditions, cancers [47] and several neurodegenerative disorders [63]. It is interesting to note that such stresses including H2O2 and UV induce apoD gene expression as well as the catalytic activity of Parp-1 [27], [64], [65]. Therefore, it would be of interest to investigate if Parp-1 and APEX-1 also modulate the apoD gene expression under these conditions and will definitely clarify the mechanism of regulation of the gene. Indeed, apoD is considered as a stress protein, and we demonstrated that it plays a protective effect for neurons of mice treated with paraquat [65]. A similar protection against oxidative stress was observed in Drosophila and plants [65], [66]. Protection was also observed in mice infected with OC43, a coronavirus that induces brain inflammation and neurodegeneration [64].",

The positive effect of Parp-1 and HnRNP-U was also confirmed by the knock down of their expression with specific siRNA. Their inhibition totally abolished the apoD gene induction under serum starvation conditions (Fig. 4C). Moreover, we further demonstrated the importance of Parp-1 and APEX-1catalytic activities in the induction of apoD gene expression in growth-arrested cells. These results were observed either by deleting the C-terminal portion containing the catalytic domain of Parp-1 (Fig. 4A) or by inhibiting its catalytic activity with a specific inhibitor 3-ABA (Fig. 5A). For APEX-1, both its redox and DNA-binding activities were necessary to transactivate the apoD promoter and we demonstrate a link between APEX-1 redox activity and the cell cycle regulation since inhibition of APEX-1 activity promotes cell proliferation under serum starvation (Supplemental Fig. 1). This is consistent with the strong relation between the redox cycle and cell cycle regulation [69], [70].",

            "text": "We also found that the inhibition of MEK1/2 blocks apoD gene induction by growth-arrest after 2 days showing the importance of this pathway in the regulation of apoD gene expression. This is surprising since ERK1/2 activation is essential for cell cycle progression from G1- to S-phase by downregulating several antiproliferative genes [71], [72]. However, ERK1, but not ERK2, expression in fibroblasts inhibits oncogenic Ras-mediated proliferation, colony formation as well as tumor production in nude mice [73]. More importantly, the B-Raf isoforms can induce cell-cycle arrest in NIH/3T3 cells [74]. In this study, we showed biphasic ERK1/2 activation in time in growth-arrested NIH/3T3 cells, reaching a peak at 15 min, decreasing after 30 min and activated again 24 h later (Fig 5C). In addition, ERK2 remains phosphorylated for up to 2 h in the presence of Parp-1 inhibitor which blocks apoD expression (Fig. 5D). This result implies that ERK1/2 activation is necessary for apoD gene induction. This regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in growth arrest conditions could be mediated by Parp-1 activity. Further investigations are necessary to verify if ERK1/2 are effectively ADP-(ribosyl)ated in stress conditions and also to determine if ERK1/2 kinase activity is directly involved in the regulation of the nuclear factors identified herein.",
