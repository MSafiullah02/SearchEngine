            "text": "A single membrane-bound aminopeptidase N (APN) occurs in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) midgut, with a pH optimum of 7.0, pI of 8.1 and molecular mass of 130 kDa. This enzyme accounts for more than 15.6% of the total gut proteins. After being solubilized in detergent, APN was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme is a glycoprotein rich in mannose residues, which binds the entomotoxic lectins of the concanavalin family. The internal sequence of APN is homologous with a conservative domain in APNs, and degenerated primers of highly conserved APN motifs were used to screen a gut cDNA library. The complete sequence of APN has standard residues involved in zinc co-ordination and catalysis and a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor, as in APNs from Lepidoptera. APN has a broad specificity towards N-terminal amino acids, but does not hydrolyze acidic aminoacyl-peptides, thus resembling the mammalian enzyme (EC 3.4.11.2). The k cat \u2044 K m ratios for different di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-peptides suggest a preference for tripeptides, and that subsites S 1 , S 2 \u00a2 and S 3 \u00a2 are pockets able to bind bulky aminoacyl residues. Bestatin and amastatin bound APN in a rapidly reversible mode, with K i values of 1.8 lm and 0.6 lm, respectively. EDTA inactivates this APN (k obs 0.14 m )1 AEs )1 , reaction order of 0.44) at a rate that is reduced by competitive inhibitors. In addition to oligopeptide digestion, APN is proposed to be associated with amino-acid-absorption processes which, in contrast with aminopeptidase activity, may be hampered on lectin binding. numbering according to thermolysin), and Glu143 (catalytic active residue). This conserved motif classifies the enzymes as members of the M 1 family of neutral zinc metallopeptidases [21] . In spite of these research efforts, there are few detailed studies on the substrate specificity of lepidopteran microvillar APNs [1, 2] .",

Molecular masses determined by SDS \u2044 PAGE (150 kDa) or gel filtration (200 kDa) are probably artifacts. The molecular mass of the unglycosylated protein is 109 kDa and pI 5.3 (predicted from the amino-acid sequence). The data led us to conclude that 16% of the molecular mass of APN is carbohydrate. Immunoblot for identification of glycosylated proteins recognized APN as the most abundant glycoprotein in the midgut and thus as an important target for lectins. Taking into account that more than one lectin can bind a single APN molecule (Fig. 5) , and the abundance of APN in microvillar membrane, this enzyme is potentially the most important lectin-binding site in aphid midgut. The calculated amount of aminopeptidase in microvillar membrane may explain the capacity of each aphid to feed on a diet containing lectins amounting to as much as 1 lg of ConA in 48 h [29] . Also immunohistochemical observations of lectin binding on the midgut demonstrated that the stomach (ventriculus 1) cell membranes are the primary target for ConA, followed by the intestine (remaining midgut chambers) cell membranes [29] . Activity measurements found APN along the midgut, and imunolocalization with APN antibodies showed that APN is associated with a specialized plasma membrane associated with the apical lamellae. These consist of a complex network of lamellae, linked one to another by trabecullae to resist the osmotic pressure caused by high-sugar phloem-sap ingestion [28] . The apical lamellae replace the regularly arranged microvilli observed in most midgut cells. APN localization data are in agreement with the lectin-binding site found by Sauvion et al. [29] .

APN is certainly responsible for the final digestion of peptides generated by cathepsin L. Another possibility is that APN is somehow associated with putative amino-acid-binding sites at the plasma membranes associated with the apical lamellae (modified perimicrovillar membranes). These are thought to increase the amino-acid concentration (usually low in the aphid diet) [28] , thus facilitating absorption. APN may also be directly linked to absorptive sites in apical lamellae, as has been suggested for Lepidoptera [42] . Finally, APN may serve as the primary digestive enzyme responsible for the assimilation of the phloem sap small peptide fraction, chemical components largely unexplored at the moment.",

The authors postulated that alteration of iron metabolism might be related to its lectin toxicity. Although ferritin was not the most abundant protein in midgut preparations, this protein was the most specifically recognized in N. lugens. However, none of the 2D PAGE protein spots observed in pea aphid homogenates as binding to ConBr was identified as corresponding to ferritin (F. A. Mendonca de Sousa & Y.

Consequently, this toxicity must result from lectin binding to target proteins in the apical membranes from the midgut, although not related to the inhibition of APN activity. One explanation of this effect is a decrease in amino-acid absorption caused by ConA binding to APN, with deleterious effects on the putative associated proteins thought to bind to amino acids (see above). Indeed, ConA-intoxicated aphids have been shown to display altered hemolymph free aminoacid profiles and modified excretion of asparagine in their honeydew [47] . It is still possible that a reduction in membrane protein lateral mobility or its resistance to phloem osmotic pressure is the major cause of lectin toxicity to aphids.
