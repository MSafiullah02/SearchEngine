            "text": "Spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) and spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP) are ingredients with a high concentration of very digestible protein, and numerous studies have documented the benefits of feeding diets containing SDPP to weaned pigs (Gatnau et al., 1989; P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al., 2016). Functional proteins contained in animal plasma are responsible for the beneficial effects, and spray drying is a rapid heating process necessary for conserving the biological activity of these proteins (Torrallardona, 2010). However, there is a risk of disease transmission when feeding improperly processed porcine-derived tissues to pigs, and feeding SDPP was associated with transmission of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) to nursery pigs (Pasick et al., 2014). This risk appears to be relatively low because spray drying inactivates porcine circovirus (Pujols et al., 2008, 2011; Shen et al., 2011) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Polo et al., 2005). Likewise, spray drying appears to inactivate PEDv (Gerber et al., 2014; Pujols and Segal\u00e9s, 2014). In fact, a recent risk analysis indicated low to negligible probability of PEDv transmission among herds of pigs consuming SDPP (Sampedro et al., 2016).",

Ultraviolet irradiation effectively inactivated porcine parvovirus in liquid bovine plasma in a pilot scale facility (Polo et al., 2015). However, no studies have evaluated the impact of UV irradiation at a commercial facility on the functional properties of SDPP. Also, there are no data on the effect of UV-irradiated SDPP (UV-SDPP) on growth performance of pigs under a mild disease challenge. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare growth performance, morbidity, and mortality of nursery pigs fed a source of commercially produced UV-SDPP with a source of SDBP that was not irradiated under unsanitary environment.",

The UV irradiation method used is a proprietary process but is similar to the conditions for UV irradiation of SDPP described by Polo et al. (2015) and was adapted to commercial-scale production. All diets were formulated to meet or exceed NRC (2012) requirements for pigs with 6.5 kg initial BW. Diets contained 3,400 ME kcal/kg with a 5% safety margin for Lys:ME ratio and P and contained no antibiotics. All diets were fed in meal form in 3 phases (phase 1 = d 0 to 13, phase 2 d 14 to 27, and phase 3 = d 28 to 55). In phase 1, a control diet (CON) without UV-SDPP or SDBP and 4 diets containing either 3 or 6% UV-SDPP or nonirradiated SDBP were fed (Table 1). The inclusion of soybean meal in phase 1 diets was limited to 25%, and AA from UV-SDPP or SDBP were replaced using soy protein concentrate (Soycomil-P; Archer Daniels Midland Company, Decatur, IL) to meet the standardized ileal digestible AA requirements (Makkink et al., 1994; NRC, 2012). In phase 2, dietary inclusion rates of SDBP and UV-SDPP were reduced by 50% to provide 1.5 or 3% of each source of spray-dried plasma, and ingredient concentrations were adjusted to meet all nutrient requirements of pigs during this phase (Table 2).

The GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (version 9.3; SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) was used to evaluate the main effects of spray-dried plasma processing (irradiated vs. nonirradiated) and inclusion level (none, low, or high) of the spray-dried plasma in the diets, and block and room were random effects. However, after analysis, there were no significant interactions with room or pen, resulting in block as the main random effect. Repeated measures over time were used to account for the effect of multiple weigh days. The statement for Poisson distribution was used for morbidity and mortality data. Linear and quadratic orthogonal polynomial effects were tested with the CONTRAST option of SAS to evaluate differences among diets containing different levels of non-UV-irradiated vs. UV-irradiated spray-dried plasma and using the CON as 0% inclusion for both types of plasma. Data were analyzed using the UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS to evaluate normality of model residuals. When appropriate, means were separated using Tukey's adjustment and reported as least squares means. No pen data were removed from the data set as outliers due to the high variance among treatments.

Under these conditions, along with feeding nonmedicated diets, 80% of pigs fed the CON required injectable medications (expressed as morbidity) within the first 6 d after weaning (data not shown). On d 11, all pigs were provided electrolytes in their drinking water (Bluelite; TechMix, LLC) and were treated with amoxicillin (West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp.) in their drinking water on d 20, 27, and 33. At the end of the experiment, 109% of pigs were treated with injectable antibiotics in the CON, indicating that some pigs were treated more than once. However, there were no differences in morbidity (overall percentage of pigs treated) among dietary treatments when evaluating individual injectable medications (Table 5). The most significant effect of feeding UV-SDPP or SDBP diets was observed by decreased mortality rather than a decrease in morbidity. There was a linear (P < 0.01) decrease in mortality of pigs fed increasing dietary levels of UV-SDPP or SDBP (Fig. 1). Furthermore, there were multiple causes of morbidity and mortality for the 36 pigs that died or were removed from the experiment. Necropsies confirmed that 3 pigs died from signs of colibacillosis (E. coli), 6 pigs died from signs of Streptococcus suis infection, 19 pigs died due to nonspecific signs of poor health, and 8 pigs were humanely euthanized due to animal welfare concerns. The greatest health challenge was observed during the first week after weaning, when 21 pigs were removed (8 from the CON, 5 from 3% SDBP, 4 from 3% UV-SDPP, 3 from 6% SDBP, and 1 from 6% UV-SDPP). Nine pigs were removed during phase 2 (2 from the CON, 2 from 3% SDBP, 2 from 3% UV-SDPP, 1 from 6% SDBP, and 2 from 6% UV-SDPP), and 6 pigs were removed during phase 3 (1 from the CON, 2 from 3% SDBP, 0 from 3% UV-SDPP, 0 from 6% SDBP, and 3 from 6% UV-SDPP).

A common observation is that pigs raised in institutional research facilities (with low pig and pathogen density) have less disease challenge than pigs in commercial facilities (Coffey and Cromwell, 1995). Therefore, feeding trials testing interventions to mitigate negative impact of disease challenge are not suitable to make inferences on the effectiveness of the intervention in growth of pigs in commercial facilities. However, our observations suggest that the unsanitary housing conditions used in our research facilities was effective, potentially generating a greater environmental microbial load, which appeared to provide a disease challenge more than that observed on commercial farms in the U.S. pork industry because the mortality rate was greater than the 5% reported for most farms (NPB, 2015). Therefore, it is possible to infer that pigs fed under commercial conditions would also respond in magnitude similar to the improvements in growth performance and reductions in mortality that were observed in this experiment from feeding UV-SDPP or SDBP diets (Torrallardona, 2010; Pujols et al., 2016).",

Also, the fact that growth of pigs fed UV-SDPP was similar to that of pigs fed SDBP suggests that there are no detrimental effects of feeding pigs diets or feed ingredients that were UV irradiated and that UV irradiation is a process useful to decrease pathogens in spray-dried plasma. This is consistent with other studies that demonstrated that feeding \u03b3-irradiated complete diets is not detrimental to growth performance of nursery pigs (DeRouchey et al., 2001, 2003a,b; Keegan et al., 2003). It is worth mentioning that UV irradiation inactivates the virus but it does not destroy the genomic material. The manufacturing lot of UV-SDPP used in the feed for this study contained PEDV genome confirmed by a PCR (Ct = 32). Likewise, samples of phase 1 diets containing the UV-SDPP (stored at \u221220\u00b0C and analyzed 1 yr after production) had detectable PEDv genome (>40 in the CON, >40 in 3% SDBP, 35 in3% UV-SDPP, >40 in 6% SDBP, and 36 in 6% UV-SDPP). The increase in Ct values between the ingredient and final diets may be due to the dilution of the virus genome in the final feed after blending and to genome degradation during storage conditions (12 mo at \u221220\u00b0C). These observations suggest that UV irradiation does not render PEDv genomic material undetectable but confirms that genomic material in SDPP was not infectious and indicates a need for developing more accurate and sensitive diagnostic methods to detect PEDv and other viruses in feed ingredients to determine their relative risk of transmission via this route (Sampedro et al., 2016).",
