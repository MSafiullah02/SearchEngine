Patients with cancer may have factors which place them at high risk for COVID 19 morbidity or mortality. Highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens and possible exposure to COVID-19 during treatment may put patients at additional risk. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology convened an expert panel to address recommendations for best practices during this crisis to minimize risk to patients from deviations in cancer care and from COVID-19 morbidity. Methods: An expert panel convened to develop initial consensus guidelines regarding antineoplastic therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to gynecologic cancer care and clinical trials.",

In addition, this pandemic will likely strain resources, making delivery of cancer care or conduct of clinical trials unpredictable. Recommendations are to limit visits and contact with health care facilities by using telemedicine when appropriate, and choosing regimens which require less frequent visits and which are less immunosuppressive. Deviations will occur in clinical trials as a result of limited resources, and it is important to understand regulatory obligations to trial sponsors as well as to the IRB to ensure that clinical trial and patient safety oversight are maintained.",

The recent Wuhan experience of 1524 patients reported in JAMA Oncology noted that the infection rate in cancer patients was double that of general population (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.89-3.02) [1] . In addition, over 41% of COVID- 19 infections were contracted in the hospital [2] . Cancer patients admitted were at higher risk of severe events (composite endpoint: percentage of patients admitted to ICU, ventilated, or death) compared with patients without cancer (seven [39%] of 18 patients vs 124 [8%] of 1572 patients; Fisher's exact p=0\u00b70003). Lastly, patients who underwent chemotherapy or surgery within the previous month had a numerically higher risk of severe events [3] . Though these were small series reported in China with differences in cancer care and no gynecologic cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period, the findings are informative in helping us understand the potential risks to our patients with cancer.",

While NACT can avoid many of these challenges, it does require a biopsy for pathologic confirmation, and chemotherapy will still result in an immunocompromised state. Randomized phase 3 trials, including EORTC and CHORUS, demonstrated that NACT is not inferior to primary surgical cytoreduction with respect to overall and progression-free survival, with lower morbidity [4, 5] .

For patients in whom chemotherapy is being considered, emerging data have reported both higher rate of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients as well as increased risk of severe events, especially in patients who have received recent cancer-directed therapy [1, 3, 38] . As such, when making decisions about proceeding with therapy for recurrent disease and choice of therapy regimen, careful consideration must be made regarding the benefits of therapy in terms of symptomatic relief, survival, and prevention of hospitalization, compared to the risks of increased exposure to the medical setting for therapy, possible complications of therapy, and potential for increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity. testing. While corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment of IR-related pneumonitis [43] , steroids can prolong immunosuppression; increase risk of infections; delay viral clearance; and increase viral pneumonitis mortality [44, 45] . Currently, the WHO and CDC recommend that corticosteroids not be used in treatment of COVID-19 viral pneumonia or ARDS unless indicated for another reason (asthma, COPD, septic shock) [46] Carefully evaluate anticipated benefit before starting immunotherapy. Pre-existing lymphopenia is associated with lower immunotherapy response and predicts more severe COVID-19 infections [31, 47] . Immunotherapy administration at higher dose and longer treatment intervals can decrease clinic visit frequency [48] .",
