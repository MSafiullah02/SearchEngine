During prolonged therapy, however, in some patients, such efficacy is attenuated by the emergence of drug-resistant variants (Calmy et al., 2004). Moreover, combination chemotherapy occasionally induces various adverse effects and may also increase the costs of the therapy. Therefore, development of novel anti-HIV-1 drugs that suppress replication of resistant variants, and are less toxic and less cost is urgently needed.",

One approach is the development of anti-HIV-1 drugs which inhibit new targets such as viral integrase (Hazuda et al., 2004) or cellular receptors such as CCR5 (Tagat et al., 2004). Actually, an integrase inhibitor, raltegravir (Grinsztejn et al., 2007), and a CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc (F\u00e4tkenheuer et al., 2005) have been approved for clinical application. The other is the development or modification of current drugs that inhibit well-established targets, to make them effective against resistant variants while reducing adverse side-effects. In this study, we focus on the recently established and promising target of virus\u2013cell membrane fusion.",

            "text": "The mechanism of virus\u2013cell membrane fusion has already been disclosed (Eckert and Kim, 2001). Briefly, one of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, gp120, binds to the host cell receptor CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5, and then, another membrane-spanning protein gp41 in trimer anchors itself to the host cell membrane. After anchoring, heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), which are two extra-virion \u03b1-helical regions in the gp41, form an anti-parallel 6-helical bundle and lead to fusion of HIV-1 with the host cell membrane. On the basis of this molecular mechanism, compounds which prevent 6-helical bundle formation will be potential HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. Enfuvirtide (T-20) is the first peptide approved and used against HIV-1 variants that are refractory to the effect of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (Lalezari et al., 2003, Lazzarin et al., 2003). Previously, we and others have developed novel potent fusion inhibitors, in the form of gp41 HR2-derived peptides (Bewley et al., 2002, Otaka et al., 2002, Root et al., 2001) (Fig. 1\n) and small molecules (Cai and Gochin, 2007, Frey et al., 2006). However, no fusion inhibitors, except for T-20, have been approved for clinical use. To screen further potential fusion inhibitors, we have established two simple, rapid and reproducible in vitro screening systems using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",

A DNA fragment coding the HR1 region of HIV-1 gp41, amino acid positions 18\u201373, was amplified by PCR from an HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 (GenBank accession number: AF324493). The amplified HR1 region was ligated into the pMAL-C2 vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) to express HR1 with maltose-binding protein (MBP) as a tag, designated pMAL-HR1. The HR2 region, gp41 amino acid positions 112\u2013150, was also amplified and ligated into both the pGEX-5X vector (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and the pET32-ALP construct to express HR2 fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and TRX-ALP, designated pGEX-HR2 and pET32-ALP-HR2, respectively.

The period for efficient coating of MBP-HR1 to the plate was measured by detection of ALP-conjugated anti-MBP antibody. After 8 h and up to 24 h little increase in efficiency of MBP-HR1 coating was observed (data not shown). When coating and blocking were performed prior to the assay, total time of the procedure, excluding washing, was only 3 h.",

The inhibitory effects of these peptide fusion inhibitors were reproducible and displayed a sigmoidal dose-dependent curve (Fig. 2B and E). These results suggested that our established ELISAs were specific for the interaction between HR1 and HR2 in the fusion process. Higher sensitivities for peptides tested were obtained by F-ELISA compared with those by Ab-ELISA (Table 1). However, compared with the MAGI assay, sensitivities of both ELISAs were between 14- and 50-fold lower. Neither ELISA technique was able to detect the inhibitory effect of T-20, which has anti-fusion activity in vitro and in vivo, even though the gp41 amino acid region 23\u201358, which is a predictive site for T-20 interaction, is included in the MBP-HR1 fusion protein (Fig. 1, Fig. 2C and F; Table 1). We further examined the effect on T-20 susceptibility of changing the coating and interaction. In this experiment, first GST-HR2 was coated, then exposed to MBP-HR1, and finally detected by anti-MBP antibody. Again C34 and its derivatives were effective, but T-20 was not (data not shown).",

However, high concentrations of DMSO (over 1%) reduced cell viability in the cell-based assay, e.g., MAGI assay. The ELISA systems described here do not require cells, thus should be less influenced by DMSO concentration compared to the MAGI assay. To verify this, we determined the concentration of DMSO that affects the interaction of HR1 and HR2 in our ELISAs. In both the Ab-ELISA and F-ELISA, DMSO concentrations up to 10% did not influence the optical densities to any significant extent (Fig. 4A). At these concentrations, optical densities recorded were less than 20% lower compared to those recorded in the absence of DMSO, indicating that the sensitivities of these tests would be sufficient to screen compounds that are dissolved in reagents containing up to 10% DMSO.",

High concentrations of some compounds that are highly acidic or basic may decrease viability of the cells in cell-based assays.

In the F-ELISA, binding of HR1 and HR2 was 2\u20132.5-fold greater at pH less than 7 than at pH 7.4, while in the Ab-ELISA, the binding was relatively stable at pH 6 (Fig. 4B) and reduction of HR1 and HR2 binding was less than 20%. On the other hand, at basic pH, binding of HR1 and HR2 were relatively stable up to pH 9 in both ELISAs. These results indicate that both systems are less influenced by DMSO concentrations up to 10% and in basic reaction conditions compared to cell-based assays.

However, T-20 lacking the N-terminal 10 amino acids of C34 but containing an additional 12 amino acids in the C-terminal region did not show activity in either of the ELISA systems (Fig. 2; Table 1). T-20 is believed to inhibit 6-helical bundle formation through competition with the physiological HR2 region of gp41. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the introduction of a site of mutations for T-20 resistance in vivo. Variants isolated from T-20 treated patients frequently display mutations in the HR1 region, especially at amino acids 36\u201345, including D36G/V/S, V38A/E and N43D (Aquaro et al., 2006, Cabrera et al., 2006, Mink et al., 2005, Poveda et al., 2002, Rimsky et al., 1998, Wei et al., 2002) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, amino acid positions 36\u201345 are also crucial for C34 binding, and some C34 resistant variants also show cross-resistance to T-20 (Nameki et al., 2005). Moreover, our preliminary data in the time course of addition experiments showed that the profile of inhibition is identical between C34 and T-20 (data not shown).",

Jiang et al. has proposed that HR2 peptides have two different functional domains, an HR1-binding domain, and a lipid-binding domain (Liu et al., 2007). C34 contains an HR1-binding sequence but not a lipid-binding domain, while T-20 has only a lipid-binding domain, suggesting that T-20 might be functional only in the presence of lipid membrane. Wexler-Cohen and Shai (2007). also found that the C-terminal region of T-20 which was not included in C34 could be replaced with fatty acid, indicating that T-20 acts through the lipid membrane.",

Most of them utilize the NC-1 monoclonal antibody which recognizes discontinuous epitopes presented on the 6-helix complex between N36 and C34 to detect 6-helical conformations (Huang et al., 2006, Huang et al., 2007, Jiang et al., 1999, Liu et al., 2007). It is predicted that this system may not detect the peptide-based fusion inhibitor C34 itself or may not detect C34 derivatives, since the antibody NC-1 was derived from the 6-helix conformation of N36 and C34 peptides. Ryu et al. (1998) also reported similar ELISA systems, but showed an inhibitory effect only for C51 with an EC50 value of 1.0 \u03bcg/ml (approximately 200 nM). Other groups have reported the development of assay systems using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Cai and Gochin, 2007, Xu et al., 2007). Although FRET requires no coating and washing steps, it seems to be less sensitive compared to our ELISA systems. In fact, EC50 values of C34 in the FRET system were described as approximately 5 \u03bcM (Xu et al., 2007), while those in our Ab-ELISA and F-ELISA were 365 and 59 nM, respectively (Table 1).",
