It can also be used for prophylaxis and the treatment of bleeding in patients with other diseases resulting from a factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency. The key constituents of Haemate P/Humate\u2010P are human von Willebrand factor (VWF) and the coagulation factor, FVIII. The Haemate P/Humate\u2010P manufacturing process is designed to purify, concentrate the desired VWF and FVIII proteins and to inactivate/remove viruses that may potentially be present in the starting material i.e. the plasma pool for fractionation. Haemate P/Humate\u2010P is a lyophilized product that is reconstituted with water for injection, prior to administration, to facilitate appropriate blood coagulation in patients.",

The pasteurization step involved heat\u2010treating of the stabilized product intermediate in aqueous solution at 60\u00b0C for 10 h. Since that time, several other virus reduction measures have been implemented to increase the safety margin of the final product, including the stringent selection of all donors and screening of all donations for markers and genomes of transfusion\u2010relevant viruses. Any seropositive or virus\u2010reactive donations are discarded. The plasma pool for fractionation is then rechecked for the presence of viruses prior to further stages of the manufacturing process. Various steps in the Haemate P/Humate\u2010P manufacturing process inactivate or remove remaining viruses; this has been confirmed in carefully planned virus\u2010validation studies using viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics, including enveloped and non\u2010enveloped viruses. The concept of a virus\u2010safe, plasma\u2010derived product is in line with the European guideline CPMP/BWP/268/95 [1], which addresses three complementary approaches to control potential viral contamination of biological products. These include: (i) the selection and testing of source plasma for the absence of viruses, (ii) testing the ability of the production process to remove or inactivate viruses and (iii) testing the product, at appropriate stages of production, for any contaminating viruses. In addition, the impact of new pathogens, including prions [(the causative agent of variant Creutzfeldt\u2010Jakob disease (vCJD)], which may enter the plasma pool for fractionation and present a risk to the recipients of the product, is carefully assessed. Virus validation and prion evaluation studies are performed to assess how effectively these new pathogens can be removed and/or inactivated during the manufacturing process. The main procedures aimed at reducing the load of infectious viruses emanating from plasma during the Haemate P/Humate\u2010P manufacturing process are outlined in Fig. 1.",

By carefully choosing the starting material, the potential load of hazardous viruses can be reduced to a minute amount or even eliminated. Improvements that ensure the safety of the starting plasma have been achieved in the collection process itself, for example, the careful selection of donor centres and donors. Plasma is either collected by plasmapheresis (source plasma) at designated collection centres \u2013 most of them owned by and all of them audited by CSL Behring and inspected by the relevant authorities \u2013 or from whole blood donations (recovered plasma) collected by transfusion services. All donors are required to undergo a physical examination and to provide answers to a predefined questionnaire at the time of each donation. The questionnaire is used to identify any donor who could pose a risk, in terms of transmitting pathogens, and to reject their donation and defer the donor either temporarily or indefinitely depending on the risk. For source plasma donations, the first donation from an \u2018applicant\u2019 donor (first time donor) is initially quarantined. This quarantine can only be lifted when the donor has successfully passed a second medical history assessment and a second donation has been screened and shown to be free of transfusion\u2010relevant viruses. These measures result in a healthy population of donors (known as \u2018qualified\u2019 donors) committed to donating plasma. Source plasma from donors who have not reached the status of qualified donors is not processed for further manufacturing and is therefore destroyed. Qualified donors who have not made a donation for a period of 6 months or more are considered to be applicant donors again. All donations are screened for viruses using currently approved serological and nucleic acid amplification assays.",

            "text": "Testing for viral markers (antibodies against HIV\u20101/\u20102 and HCV encoded antigens) exhibits both a sensitivity limit and a temporal dependency (Fig. 2). This time\u2010period, known as the \u2018diagnostic window\u2019, is particularly relevant for tests based on antibody detection techniques. It encompasses the period during which serological screening of a donation is negative despite the sample actually containing infectious virus. This diagnostic window occurs because there is a time lapse between an individual being infected with a virus and their body\u2019s ability to recognize the virus and subsequently generate enough specific antibody\u2010producing cells (i.e. time to seroconvert). Therefore, plasma donations are stored in an inventory hold to address post\u2010donation information. Source plasma, which can be obtained several times per month from each donor, is stored for at least 60 days in the inventory hold before further processing occurs. During the inventory hold period, all post\u2010donation information relating to the donor is assessed with regard to the suitability of the stored plasma. The most important information is whether seroconversion is detected in a subsequent donation from the same donor. If seroconversion has occurred, all stored donations from that donor are removed from the inventory hold and destroyed, thus preventing potentially virus contaminated, but seronegative donations, from being processed into the plasma pool for fractionation. Any post\u2010donation information from a whole blood donor, such as revealing a blood\u2010borne virus infection in a recipient or components of that donation, would also result in the destruction of that donor\u2019s stored plasma. Post\u2010donation information also includes the results of testing for genomic material of transfusion\u2010relevant viruses. Furthermore, if new information on the suitability of a donor is gathered during the inventory hold period, a risk assessment is performed and stored donation(s) may then be destroyed based on the assessment outcome. Therefore, by utilizing an inventory hold, donations that may present a virus\u2010transmission risk can be identified and eliminated from the production process (Fig. 3). Donations from applicant donors are stored in quarantine until a second donation confirms the health of the donor; the first donation is subsequently forwarded to the inventory hold.",

The epidemiology of vCJD indicates that currently only donors in the UK and France may pose a vCJD risk, in contrast to plasma donations from all other European countries and from the USA. Based on the donor deferral criteria implemented at CSL Behring, it can be assumed that donations from no more than one potentially infected donor would enter a plasma pool of sufficient size to produce one batch of Haemate P/Humate\u2010P. In addition, the prion load in the donation would be very low. The level of infectivity in blood is estimated to be approximately two ID50 per mL of blood \u2013 where one ID50 has a 50% probability of causing an infection \u2013 when administered via intravenous therapy [53]. Therefore, even in the worst case scenario, the prion load in a plasma pool for fractionation is considered to be very low and any prions potentially present in the plasma pool would be removed effectively by the manufacturing process.

The resultant figure is then divided by the prion reduction factor obtained from evaluation studies [27, 66].

As a result, a probability model is more appropriate for calculating the safety margin. This approach was used by the FDA to determine that a prion reduction factor of at least 4 log10 would result in FVIII products with a very remote risk of vCJD transmission [67]. Considering that the prion reduction factor for Haemate P/Humate\u2010P is at least 6.4 log10, calculating the risk of vCJD transmission using this approach results in a negligible risk of transmission following the administration of Haemate P/Humate\u2010P.",
