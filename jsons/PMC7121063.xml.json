There remains an apparent assumption that the resource-providing organisms are a random sample of all organisms. This is almost certainly untrue and I return to this matter of fact shortly.

The majority of this minority \u2013 \u00adespecially when it comes to food (which I discuss just below) and medicine (which I discuss in Sect. 6.5.1) \u2013 are highly likely to persist even in the face of a general decline in biodiversity. Furthermore, there is little reason to believe that this circumstance will change in the future. These facts combine with the other that any economic resource competes with other economic demands. As a consequence, from an economic point of view (which includes both resource and \u201cservice\u201d value, the topic of Sect. 6.3, Biodiversity as service provider), there is scarcely ever justification for not letting a species go extinct \u2013 even if the effort or cost required to save it is minimal. Certainly, many if not most of the \u00adsymbolic creatures \u2013 such as Ursus maritimus (polar bear) and Eubalaena spp. (right whales) \u2013 fall into this category. When, as in the case of both these creatures, there is, in fact, a significant economic cost to saving them \u2013 for polar bears, reversing climate warming,7 for right whales, slowing down or rerouting the ships that traverse their thoroughfares \u2013 then the mere possibility of a future benefit from their incremental contribution to species diversity is an essentially nil \u201cexpected net present value\u201d (to use the standard \u00adeconomic jargon) by comparison. Daniel Faith joins other conservation biologists in supposing that biodiversity as a resource has (positive) option value. But demonstrating that requires showing that biodiversity commands a premium over its expected value to consumers, which standard it already fails to meet. Where Faith leaves off with option value, James Maclaurin and Kim Sterelny pick up. I take up their treatment of this theory of biodiversity value in Sect. 6.9 (Biodiversity options).8\n",

But the correlation has been found to hold in a wide range of different ecosystems, making it one of the more generally applicable and most highly verified principles in ecology. These days, great effort is devoted to finding ways to \u201cde-intensify\u201d the use of land given over for the production of food.

But even if one condones this unprincipled exclusion, the evidence is at best shaky for the proposition that biodiversity has much if any beneficial effect. The science simply does not strongly support this sanguine assessment. Even if a species is not performing disservices (in the restricted sense of \u201cecosystem disservices\u201d), if it is rare and isolated, it is unlikely to be performing any real positive service.24 Many ecosystem services, such as the oft-cited provision of potable water to New York City (discussed in Sect. 2.2.1, The bare assertion fallacy), make minimal demands on biodiversity. While this conclusion seems difficult to avoid, this unavoidable conclusion is routinely avoided: A high degree of biodiversity is often not critical for delivering ecosystem services; and furthermore, many species in many ecosystems are the bane of human existence. Therefore, even when the service-contribution standard of evaluation is arbitrarily confined to ecosystem services, what this standard shields is service-providing diversity, while blithely leaving biodiversity-at-large to suffer or, more likely, be decimated. When non-ecosystem services and disservices are brought back into the equation (as in the preceding paragraph), the status of biodiversity-at-large is even more dramatically reduced.

A radical compartmental leakage occurs because the same kind of function can have (positive) value in one context and disvalue in another. Nutrient retention and nitrogen fixation can be services when agriculture is served by fertilization efficiency. But these are viewed as disservices when they impinge on the success of favored plants and other organisms whose adaptive advantage derives from their ability to thrive in nitrogen-impoverished soils.34 Pollination services might be pollination disservices when what is pollinated is considered a noxious weed.

The fact is that many functions in the human-coveted set \u2013 that is, many services \u2013 derive from relatively non-diverse landscapes. And many of these landscapes are highly human-engineered according to a specification that requires the weeding out of previous, naturally occurring resident organisms.

Fish and crustaceans have higher requirements for oxygen and they react very quickly to a lack of oxygen. Other species can tolerate low dissolved oxygen for longer periods.

            "text": "Many versions of Precautionary Principle are possible and many versions have been proffered. But it is relatively safe to say that no reasonable Precautionary Principle lacks certain basic ingredients. In the context of taking precautions to \u00adprevent species extinctions from disrupting ecosystem services, key ingredients are50:\n\nA threat of harm that is considered serious, great, or catastrophic. It is unclear just how \u201cserious\u201d the harm must be to justify precautionary action. The envisaged outcome must fall outside some vague boundary that circumscribes the domain of \u201cthe acceptable\u201d. It is more clear that a principle that urges precautions against small (and \u201cacceptable\u201d) harms would be difficult to defend because consistent adherence to such a principle would arguably result in greater harm (from paralysis) than the harms the precautions are supposed to avert. Most of us would say that we would cause ourselves greater harm by always refusing medications to avoid their side effects; or by refusing to drive to a job interview to avoid the additional risk of being in a traffic accident.A number of considerations bear on how serious the harm must be and how serious a threat it must constitute in order for precautionary logic to apply. They include:\nThe ability to avoid the harm altogether by severing the first link in an otherwise uncertain causal chain that leads from species extinction to disruption of service. In this regard, one must consider how one species might substitute for another in maintaining a particular, desired function. However \u00adquestionable this might be as a general principle, many biologists regard this kind of substitution as a basic tool for conserving and restoring ecosystem functions. There is also the possibility of resurrecting species, though this possibility and its attendant controversies need not burden the current discussion. Proponents of The Natural Capital Project (for example, Goldman et al. 2008, 9446) even promote substituting entire ecosystems and habitats (under the rubrics \u201cmitigation banking\u201d and \u201chabitat banking\u201d) as not merely acceptable but a positive selling point for their economically oriented doctrine.The ability to ameliorate the harm, sometimes known as \u201cadaptability\u201d. This is the context in which technological substitutes are relevant.51\nThe scale and pervasiveness of the harm.How the harm is distributed, which leads to considerations of distributive justice.\n\nSome high degree of\nuncertainty\n. Care must be taken to distinguish uncertainty from \u201cmere\u201d risk as an epistemic condition in which (European Environment Agency 2001, 170, Box 16.1) \u201c\u2026 the adequate empirical or theoretical basis for assigning probabilities to outcomes does not exist.\u201d52 When risks are known, a different, non-precautionary logic is appropriate for taking them into account. On the other side of the spectrum, that a harm can be (merely) imagined to occur, or that its occurrence is a logical possibility, or that its occurring is consistent with known science cannot reasonably ground precautionary action. That would be as indefensible as stretching precaution to cover small harms and for the same reason described in item (1): It would excessively inhibit actions that have a high likelihood of rendering great benefit.Several kinds of uncertainty can be involved in precautionary logic. First, there is uncertainty in whether or not the harm will occur at all. Item (1a) bears on this kind of uncertainty by suggesting a method, already a part of current conservation and restoration practice, for substantially reducing it \u2013 perhaps to the point of making precautionary logic inappropriate.Second, if the harm (in the limited sense of an ecosystem no longer serving a particular human purpose) does occur, there is uncertainty about how seriously this occurrence should be taken, given the other considerations in item (1) and particularly the ability to adapt (item (1b)). Ehrlich et al. make a broad claim about the futility of technological adaptation. For support of this claim, these authors refer to the failure of the Biosphere 2 experiment. But that experiment was an attempt to construct a completely self-contained, human-friendly ecosystem from whole cloth rather than an experiment in extirpating or substituting for some components of one that is already functioning. And it is certainly at odds with the Natural Capital Project doctrines such as those that permit the substitution of habitats. So the relevance Biosphere 2 to their case is marginal, at best.Third, in addition to uncertainty about whether the harm will occur and how seriously such an occurrence should be taken, precautionary logic presumes uncertainty about what links and what sequence of links might form a causal chain leading up to an occurrence. Most discussions of the Precautionary Principle focus on this particular kind of uncertainty.53 The precautionary argument that warns against allowing extinctions must conceive of a plausible (though uncertain) causal chain that, starting from an extinction event, leads to a deleterious effect on an ecosystem service. As I have already said, this account must rest on something more than mere logical possibility or consistency with known science.The \u201csweet spot\u201d between blind speculation and known risk is extremely \u00addifficult to find. Ehrlich et al. are not alone in failing to supply such an account. In the narrow range of cases for which it is plausible to link a service disruption to an extinction, it seems that the causal chain is typically short and well known \u2013 that is, not at all uncertain. If a particular crop relies on a particular pollinator, then with relative certainty or at least with a scientifically ascertainable likelihood, the extirpation of the pollinator will leave the crop unpollinated. Because it is so central to the precautionary case against extinctions, I will revisit this dilemma \u2013 of attempting to cast an extinction as a Pascal\u2019s wager \u2013 immediately after this list of Precautionary Principle ingredients.Finally, it is important to emphasize the epistemic contingency that attaches to precautionary logic\u2019s grounding in uncertainty. Uncertainty reflects a current state of knowledge. Should science ever find a sound basis for assigning probabilities for a causal chain leading to a harm in ecosystem services, then a discussion of risk analysis and risk management will properly supplant precautionary logic. As I have pointed out, science has already pushed beyond a state of uncertainty for some cases within the restricted, presumptive application space for the Precautionary Principle.\nAn \u201cappropriate\u201d response to the threat and whether this response is merely permissible, advisable, or obligatory. Ehrlich et al. can be interpreted to \u00adsuggest that the appropriate response is to do what is possible to avoid letting any species go extinct and that this is obligatory, no matter what the cost. (Keep in mind that cost-benefit analysis applies in the domain of problems with understood risk, not in the Precautionary Principle\u2019s domain of uncertainty.) This exhortation is both dramatic and difficult to defend. Not the least reason for its vulnerability to objections is the fact that in some contexts such as pest control, ecosystem services are enhanced by species extirpations (local extinctions) rather than damaged by them, or so it is commonly thought. So in its unqualified form, the Precautionary Principle (on this interpretation) would seem to entail obligations that sometimes compromise ecosystem services by way of the precautionary obligation to not let any species go extinct.The obvious response to this criticism is to insist that sometimes the precautionary obligation to prevent species extinctions applies; sometimes it does not. But far from being a defense of the Precautionary Principle, this response makes it clear how its plausibility as a general action-guiding principle hinges on an accompanying framework that provides a principled way to distinguish circumstances in which precautionary measures are obligatory, advisable, permissible, or proscribed. It is a nontrivial matter to construct such a framework; and it has yet to be done \u2013 by Ehrlich et al., or by anyone else.These difficulties suggest that it might serve a Precautionary Principle well to retrench its domain yet further. At the cost of leaving out promising but difficult cases, one might try to define conditions that sharply qualify a candidate for precautionary prudence and that decisively rule out implausible and irrational applications of it. One obvious candidate condition is one (of the three) that John Rawls (1971, 154) proposes must qualify application of his \u201cmaximin\u201d rule (for choosing principles of justice)54:\n\u2026 the person choosing has a conception of the good such that he cares very little, if \u00adanything, for what he might gain above the minimum stipend that he can, in fact, be sure of by following the maximin rule. It is not worthwhile for him to take a chance for the sake of a further advantage, especially when it may turn out that he loses much that is important to him.\n",

Moreover, the planet still stands at something near an all-time earth history high point in species diversity \u2013 indeed, at an all-time high for diversity considered at almost every taxonomic level.59 Also, we know that some species \u2013 particularly the most adaptable generalists, such as H. sapiens \u2013 have often survived dramatic extinction events and squeezed through the narrowest of population bottlenecks.

Penicillium spp. (P. citrinum and P. brevicompactum) once again figure in the derivation list, this time as the organisms from which compactin, the first known statin, was isolated. Ethnobotanist Paul Cox (2009, 274) appears to suggest that red yeast from rice can also claim part credit for statins. The analgesic hydrocodone (Vicodin), in various formulations, is also now a dominant drug. It is a semi-synthetic opioid derived from naturally occurring opiates in Papaver somniferum (the opium poppy) \u2013 one of the most widely and easily cultivated plants in the world. Amoxicillin from P. notatum continues its dominance in the world of antibiotics. Premarin has fallen away with the discovery of life-threatening side effects. Zantac has yielded to omeprazole (Prolisec) and esomeprazole (Nexium, a mixture of D- and L-isomers of omeprazole), which like ranitidine (Zantac) has, at best, a tenuous connection to living organisms.",

The use of herbal medicines in developed countries is also growing and 25% of the UK population takes herbal medicines regularly.

There is growing concern about \u00addiminishing populations, loss of genetic diversity, local extinctions and habitat degradation. Well-known species threatened by wild harvesting include Arcostaphylos uva-ursa (\u00adbearberry), Piper methysticum (kava), and Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice).

But before examining this logic, I should note that not a few serious studies provide strong evidence against the premise. Among them, one study (B\u00f8gh et al. 2002) found that the protective barrier apparently afforded by cattle to cattle owners was, in fact, a matter of their greater wealth (and consequently, better access to good health care) relative to non-cattle owners. Another study (Saul 2003) found that while the cattle diverted mosquito bites, they also afforded such copious blood meals that mosquito populations flourished along with rates of (mosquito) survival. Once again, there was no prophylactic effect due to the cattle. Many other factors and conditions bear on whether or not cows in the vicinity are protective shields for humans. One factor is that cattle harbor a large variety of diseases that are transmissible to humans, including (Pelzer and Currin 2009) cryptosporidiosis, Escherichia coli infections, giardiasis, leptospirosis, Q fever, ringworm, salmonellosis, and tuberculosis.73 The many \u00adfactors and conditions that bear on the proposition that cattle are protective shields make it hopelessly and misleadingly simpleminded.

One obvious answer is one that authors on this topic never mention: Wherever vector born diseases adversely affect human health, one should introduce some one or more decoy species that will divert the bites of the vectors.74 In other words, this is a call for species introductions that serve a human health purpose.",

Rather, it would show that the introduction of one species both moderates a human disease and fertilizes the biodiverse tree of life.

A typical story line threads its way through changes (not necessarily reductions) in local biodiversity that result from the changed habitat.

Perhaps the lesson is that care must be taken in how deforestation is carried out, with particular attention given to installing proper drainage systems.

If there has been a mere shift in the relative size of the populations of different species of mosquitoes, and no species have been locally extirpated, then these circumstances say nothing about whether the diversity of species has changed. Even if, in particular places, the more benign species are entirely displaced by more aggressive Anopheles spp., then these latter species might more than make up for the local loss of the previous resident species.

This fact connects back to the prequel story, which reveals reforestation to be a prior cause of Lyme disease in the U.S. northeast. Research suggests that, at the root, the real culprits are the acorns of Quercus spp. (northeastern oaks). Ecologist Clive Jones and his colleagues found that populations of I. scapularis surged eightfold in acorn-rich plots, perhaps as the result of the deer spending more time enjoying the repast in acorn-rich environs. Densities of P. leucopus also surged with the abundance of mast, as did their Lyme infection rates in this tick-rich \u00adenvironment (Jones et al. 1998, 1024\u20131025). With this, the risk of human infection also increases. Applying the logic of convenience that infects the standard narrative to this more complete narrative might lead to the conclusion that Quercus spp. are bad for human health. This logic would target those grand trees for extirpation in areas where they nourish the nonhuman hosts that put humans at risk for Lyme disease. In fact, because they do not move and are slow growing, oak trees would be easier targets for extermination than deer, mice, or ticks. This consideration combines with the economic bonanza of valuable building material to make it likely that the removal of oaks is the most economically efficient means of reducing Lyme risk to humans in the U.S. northeast.",

            "text": "Consider various ways in which the introduction of a species into a disease system can \u2013 and in some cases have been observed to \u2013 increase the incidence of disease:\nA new predator induces populations of its prey to pack themselves more densely in areas that offer the best protection without necessarily changing the size of the prey\u2019s population. If the prey species is a pathogen host, this can increase rates of encounter between infected and susceptible host individuals, thereby providing a larger and more fertile breeding ground for the pathogen.A new species is a food resource or a mutualist for a nonhuman disease host or vector, leading to a more robust population of a key infectious agent.A new host species is a far more competent reservoir for a disease than any host previously present, leading to far higher incidence of the pathogen or parasite in vectors that transmit it to people. This is part (but only part) of the story of the Lyme bacterium hosted by P. leucopus. As another example, the rabies virus cannot be sustained in humans alone because humans rarely communicate the disease directly to each other. Introduce Procyon lotor (raccoon) and rabies becomes viable (Keesing et al. (2006, 491).A new host species, even if not a particularly competent disease reservoir, helps sustain vector populations that still feed copiously from competent reservoirs. This is the role of O. virginia (while-tailed deer) in some Lyme systems such as the well-studied one in the northeast U.S. It is also the role of Cervus elaphus (red deer), the primary host of louping ill, whose transmission vector is I. \u00adricinus, another tick. The number or density of deer must be just \u201cright\u201d. Too low, and the tick populations decline. Too high, and the deer draw too many bites from viremic hosts, such as Lagopus lagopus scotica (red grouse) (Keesing et al. (2006, 494).In a disease system in which interspecific transmission rates exceed intraspecific transmission rates, a new host species increases the prevalence of infections in all nonhuman hosts through interspecific transmission. There are several examples of this, including rabies once again: Populations of Canis adustus (side-striped jackal) in Zimbabwe could not support rabies, except via frequent re-inoculation by rabid domesticated dogs (Keesing et al. (2006, 492).An additional vector increases disease risk. The presence of two tick vectors of Lyme disease in California \u2013 I. spinipalpis and I. pacificus (Western black-legged tick) \u2013 increases the risk of Lyme disease relative to areas where only one tick species resides. Similarly, two mosquito vectors of West Nile viral encephalitis \u2013 Culex tarsalis, which feeds on birds and maintains high rates of avian infection, and C. pipiens, which bites both birds and people \u2013 are jointly responsible for high human infection rates (Molyneux et al. 2008, 307).\n",

There is no direct or clear evidence for the existence of biophilia, however defined. Proponents urge that the principles of evolutionary psychology are amenable to its existence. But it is a long way from saying that something is consistent with natural law to saying that it, in fact, exists or must exist. The third difficulty has to do with connecting biophilia to any good connected with \u201cthe natural environment\u201d for current-day humans. Let us grant for a moment that biophilia exists and that the principles of evolutionary psychology can account for its coming into existence. Even then, the mere \u201cfact\u201d of an evolved tendency \u2013 even one that for a long time conferred adaptive advantages \u2013 does not, by itself, make that tendency good or worth nurturing now.

Just over 70,000 years ago, one nightmare scenario (though probably not predominantly biotic in origin) did play out, and it brought the recently emerged species H. sapiens to the brink of extinction (Ambrose 1998, 2003).92 But so far as I can tell, an unbiased review of geological history does not favor one \u201ccreative\u201d possibility over the other. Moreover, the question of whether or not \u201cthe creative forces of nature\u201d favor or disfavor the retention of biodiversity is open. The current biodiverse state of affairs (not the diversity of it, per se) notably features an apex species with a penchant for re-engineering everything around it for what it perceives to be its own considered, near-term benefit.

If, for instance, a species went extinct, but much of its family remained, then the Earth would still have a considerable record of the evolutionary achievement that allowed species such as it to exist. We might miss this particular book of poems, but we would still have poems. Species like it could continue to evolve, since the family would be intact. But if the family goes extinct, then the chance of continuing evolution along anything like the species\u2019s line is gone. In other words, by our mass extinction \u00advoiding sections of nature\u2019s library, we are erasing whole areas of evolution.\n",

He proceeded by way of a story that is rather odd (to my way of thinking), but which nonetheless captured the imagination of many economists. The story concerns a park run as a business by a private concern.112 Despite being run with all possible efficiencies, the business is a losing proposition based on the people who actually show up to visit. Moreover, there is every indication that it will remain a loser. Despite this economically gloomy picture, Weisbrod grasps for an economic straw that would yet justify preserving the park. He (Weisbrod 1964, 472) finds it in\n\u2026 the existence of people who anticipate purchasing the commodity (visiting the park) at some time in the future, but who, in fact, never will purchase (visit) it. \u2026they will be willing to pay something for the option to consume the commodity in the future.

Although \u00adexistence value, unlike option value, does not depend on uncertainty, in another basic way, these two categories of economic value are nevertheless kissing cousins. This is so especially on Weisbrod\u2019s formulation, according to which those who anticipate visiting might (or as he says, in fact) never actually do so. Option value and existence value are both types of \u201cpassive use\u201d or \u201cnonuse\u201d value, in the parlance of modern economics.115 In other words, they are both passive ways of \u201cconsuming\u201d a resource. In Weisbrod\u2019s story, visiting the park is the predominantly non-rivalrous and non-exclusive way of \u201cconsuming\u201d116 the park. This contrasts with its rivalrous and exclusive consumption as a source of timber or granite. When I \u201cconsume\u201d an environmental good for its existence or option value, I do not diminish its value to you (consumption in this way is non-rivalrous). Furthermore, there is not a way to exclude you from enjoying the good for its existence or option value. Nor can you be kept from doing this more or less simultaneously with me (the resource is non-excludable). For Weisbrod, it appears that the major respect in which option value differs from existence value is that the former has some pretense of being about a desire (however uncertain) for eventual consumption (even when, a la Weisbrod, that desire is never actually consummated), while the latter does not. From this perspective, a non-economist might conceive of existence value as the limiting case of option value when the latter\u2019s uncertainty about demand for a resource fades into the certainty of a kind of consumption that is confined to human imagination.",

These features include120:\nHer income (y). In some possible states of the future world, Ms. Consumer loses her job or she loses her life savings in bad investments. Her income plummets, which causes her demand for any level of biodiversity q  >  0 (along with her demand for most other goods) to likewise plummet.

Deep discounts at the local boutique spa might make getting a facial massage and aromatherapy far more attractive than trying to get up close and personal with q in the personae of mosquitoes, skunks, and bears.

It is possible that she will find Weisbrod\u2019s park thronging with rude, rowdy, music-blaring yahoos, outnumbered only by the mosquitoes feasting on every inch of exposed (and even unexposed) human flesh. That might take a bite out of her demand, too. Even aside from these obnoxious possibilities, her terrible sense of direction might result in her getting lost and lead to a frightening, even near-death experience. Or by the time of her actual visit, her bad and worsening knees might prevent her from getting out of her car. On the other hand, by the time of her prospective visit, park officials might have clamped down on rowdy miscreants, sprayed for mosquitoes, and constructed trail signs that make it virtually impossible for a literate person to get lost; and successful knee surgery might have made her more mobile than ever.On the other hand, if the primary value of the biodiversity lies in its potential pharmacological value, then this condition of being the source of a valuable drug dominates its level of utility.I encapsulate these ideas by saying that the conditions ck are ones that affect the \u201cquality\u201d of biodiversity.Ms. Consumer\u2019s very preferences (reflected in the shape of her utility function u()) might change even if the above-listed factors remain constant. She might change her mind about just how much she likes biodiversity. She might come around to thinking that she is much happier not exposing herself to the possibility of getting lost. She might decide that the risk of severe sunburn, poison oak rashes, and insect bites is too much to bear. Or, on second thought, the prospect of making do without running hot water and flush toilets is just too awful to contemplate. This change of heart is not difficult to understand. Even now, most of her friends incredulously ask why she would voluntarily submit to such indignities when, with far less effort and similar expense, she could go to the spa for that aromatherapy and a facial massage.

Suppose that the demand for the drug that emerges in s4 is affected by the affordability of health insurance, which might be the only or primary means for affording access to the drug. If the price of insurance were so high as to routinely make it unaffordable, then demand for the drug might diminish to miniscule levels.

This is where all possible outcomes are known in advance and where their relative likelihood can be adequately expressed as probabilities. Where this condition prevails, risk assessment is a valid technique\u2026Under the condition of uncertainty, as formally defined, the adequate empirical or theoretical basis for assigning probabilities to outcomes does not exist. This may be because of the novelty of the activities concerned, or because of complexity or variability in their contexts. Either way, conventional risk assessment is too narrow in scope to be adequate for application under conditions of uncertainty\u2026Many case studies\u2026 involve examples where\u2026 appraisal laboured not only under a lack of certainty as to the likelihood of different outcomes, but where some of the possibilities themselves remained unknown. Here, decision-making is faced with the continual prospect of surprise. This is the condition formally known as ignorance.

The demise of most of an extant organism\u2019s near relatives can be strong evidence that it shares with its extinct cousins a lack of robust evolutionary potential or that it lacks an ability to adapt to changing conditions (adaptive plasticity). The phylogenetic isolation of a creature such as the tuatara is an indication that it and its now-extinct relatives are relatively incapable of striking out on a new adaptive course. Stephen Jay Gould (1996, 72) makes this point by reference to Equus caballus, the modern horse \u2013 \u201ca remnant of a remnant\u201d, as he characterizes this species. It is, as he says, a remnant of steady perissodactyl (not just horse) decline in contrast to equally steady ascent of artiodactyls as the dominant representatives of modern macrofauna. E. caballus is an isolated twig at the tip of the tree of life where once was some quite bushy foliage. This certainly leaves a lot of horsey morphospace vacant.

Still according to the latter-day perfectionist view, biodiversity is valuable to the extent that it exemplifies this state of perfection or one derived from it without anthropogenic inflection. Human activities can do nothing to improve on the perfect state, which, after all, was already perfect (in the relevant, natural sense); their effects can only be adulterating, except insofar as they deflect the state of nature back towards the imaginary state defined by a history uninflected by humans after the prescribed juncture of perfection.

Directly tied to the intentional production of the condos is the salient result consisting in the wetland\u2019s transformation. Perhaps this combination of intent and salient result justifies saying that, while the condo project does not affect the wetlands, its transformation of the place is a \u00adproduct of human influence.",

So far as intention is concerned, no one would dispute that the condos required careful planning and design: The intent was to build condos. But one must take care to distinguish that intention from a full accounting of the salient consequences of acting with that intention. The peculiar (intentional) nature of intention is such that, when doing A ends up (also) realizing B, a person who intended to do A need not also have intended to do B. That is certainly true when she had no idea that B would come to pass as a consequence of her doing A. But it is also true when she knew B to be an inevitable consequence of A; and it is true even when she intended to do A by doing B. In the first case, she might acknowledge that she knew that B would follow from A. In the second case, she might acknowledge that she did B precisely in order to do A. In both cases, she might be held responsible for B. But in all these cases, she might also truthfully maintain that it was only A that she intended. So it is reasonable to question whether an intention to produce a condominium complex is also an intention to obliterate the wetland that it displaces.",

The vast herds of bison in North America were partly an artifact of the elimination of all other large herbivores that had competed with bison to graze.152 Seed dispersal and distribution patterns of Neotropical plants with large, armored seeds, whose germination depended on consumption by large frugivores, were greatly altered by the extinction of 15 genera of large herbivores; a pattern that was apparently reversed at the eleventh hour by the arrival of goats, cattle, and pigs four centuries ago.

Rather (still using his vocabulary) its value is a function of the viability of that content in that place (Sarkar 2005, 173\u2013178; 2002, 136). It is unsurprising and uncontroversial that, according to Sarkar, a place with no biodiversity content has no biodiversity value. But it does seem surprising that, according to his viability requirement, the most biodiverse place on the planet also has absolutely no biodiversity value \u2013 if its complement of biodiversity is doomed. This view defies the common perception that the value of something commands increased consideration with the realization that it might soon be lost. It is valued more, and it is appropriate to value it more, on account of the short time left in which its treasures might be regarded in any way except as fond and fading memories.",

The notion that endangerment increases value has the equally uncomfortable consequence of seeming to endorse behavior that increases value via promoting endangerment. If hotspots are what really count, then other things being equal, it seems as though conservationists should do what they can to create more of them.

Moreover, it is advisable to avoid stipulating that a place is \u201centitled\u201d to its biodiversity. For on what grounds could a place be said to have such a right?

So if the endemism of a species logically entails a disproportionately large contribution to biodiversity value, then this contribution must come in through a logical back door that is not legitimately part of the concept of biodiversity itself. It is also possible that those who value endemic biodiversity presume that it contingently correlated with efficiency in conservation. That is, they might think that as a matter of contingent fact, by conserving endemics one conserves more for less cost and effort; in other words, endemic species are the key to a good heuristic for the species set cover problem. But this presumption is highly questionable: A species\u2019 high degree of endemism might entail its high degree of vulnerability to unpreventable perturbations in the specialized conditions (for example, the temperature ranges of its climate or the biogeochemistry of its habitat) that make life for that species\u2019 individuals possible.

This point pushes beyond the previous point that the triage rules themselves appear to have no principled grounding. The new point is that, even using a well-justified decision principle (which biodiversity triage is not), it is possible to arrive at a wrong decision \u2013 a decision that results in a world with less value rather than more.

            "text": "One path through this thicket is marked by categorical signposts, which signal how intent and benefits combine to progressively strengthen the case for tying moral responsibility to causal responsibility:\n\nUnintended harm. The causal agents act and behave to attain some benefit, but they are not (fully) aware that their action or behavior is harmful. If some harm is done, the agents might not perceive it as a harm. Or some consequence might register as harmful in some small or insignificant degree, but absent an appreciation of its full and possibly great significance to the party harmed. In short, though harm is done, no (or little) harm is intended.In criminal law, some cases of reckless endangerment fall into this category. However, these cases typically require that the harm be foreseeable. My definition is broader and includes cases in which even the ability to foresee cannot reasonably be expected.\nCollateral damage. The causal agents are (fully) aware that among the consequences of their actions are very likely unwanted harmful ones. These unwanted harms are viewed as unavoidable in attaining a benefit, but they are not directly instrumental in attaining that benefit. This corresponds to what, in recent, military-derived parlance, is called \u201ccollateral damage\u201d. It is less clear that a harm of this kind is completely unintended, for the action aimed at the benefit is intended and the attendant harm is expected. Perhaps one could express this unclarity by saying that the harm is only \u201cindirectly\u201d intended.Most commonly, a case of collateral damage is not a case of willful rapacity. That is because the harm is not a means to the end of a benefit; nor does the harm itself constitute any part of a benefit. However, these exclusions do not entirely preclude rapacious behavior in which the harm, though unwanted, is seen as justified by the benefit. Picture the bank robber who \u201cmust\u201d shoot the teller poised to trip the alarm. Even the act of scamming an elderly couple out of their pension can be viewed in similar fashion: The scammer derives no great benefit from the emotional and financial distress that she sadly \u201cmust\u201d inflict on her gullible victims. The benefit of the scam is the money transferred from scammed to scammer. Of course, the scammer also can be said to treat the elderly couple as a (mere) means to her end. In that respect, the scam example might be said to belong to the following category.\nMeans to benefits. The causal agents understand their acts to be harmful, but additionally regard their acts of harming to be a means or part of a means for attaining certain benefits, though the infliction of harm in itself does not constitute a benefit. Thus, it is by means of using a hostage as a human shield that the desperate criminal protects herself and makes good her escape. But placing the hostage in harm\u2019s way has no benefit independent of that. The desperada would gladly don her invisible cloak, had she remembered to bring it along for the heist.This is a step beyond \u201cindirect\u201d intention. The use of a harmful means to a beneficial end makes it plausible to say that, in contrast to collateral damage, the harm is intended in a direct way, qualified only by the fact that the focus and motivating intent is to attain the beneficial ends. It is also plausible to say that the good of such ill-gotten benefits are tainted in some serious way by the nature of the means employed to attain them.\nConstitutes a benefit. The act of harming is not just a means to a benefit, but constitutes the benefit or part thereof, and the causal agents are (fully) cognizant of this; that is, they understand that the harm to others amounts to a benefit for themselves. This constitutive relationship gives us leave to say that the harm is as much the focus of intent as the benefit that it constitutes. Such cases are the ones most prone to justifiable characterization as vicious.Fortunately, this kind of viciousness is probably quite rare. In the realm of criminal activity, it is the psychotic stuff of premeditated rape and murder for their own sake.\n",

The reasons why people appropriate turf typically have nothing to do with biodiversity and everything to do with such things as growing food, building buildings and infrastructure, and providing transport. Needless to say, every hectare of land that goes under the plow, under the foundation of a structure, or under the asphalt running up to it becomes quite a different place. So does a wide swath of surrounding land. And this change in environment is reflected in which collections of organisms do well or not so well there. In one of the more comprehensive and credible surveys that shed light on this, Wallace Erickson and his colleagues (2005) estimate that buildings and other infrastructure are responsible for the vast majority of the 500 million to 1 billion bird deaths annually in the United States alone. Human transportation continues in the grand tradition of the Columbian exchange, reshuffling the biotic deck by providing transportation for non-ticket-paying, nonhuman stowaways to places that they would not likely have visited otherwise or quite so soon. Roads and road traffic kill all manner of creatures that attempt crossings. They also are ecological walls, despite an unimpressive presence in the vertical dimension. They substantially alter the mix of organisms and hence the biodiverse state of affairs in their vicinity, not just by subdividing previously undivided habitat, but also by creating habitat edges, whose asphalt boundary creates distinctive ecological conditions quite unlike either the previously contiguous expanse or the interior of the new subdivisions.177 Merely turning on the lights turns off the lights for some number of creatures. For example, on the Hawaiian island of Kaua\u2019i, the threatened Puffinus auricularis newelli (Newell\u2019s shearwater) is threatened partly because (Mitchell et al. 2005):\nStreet and resort lights, especially in coastal regions, disorient fledglings causing them to eventually fall to the ground exhausted or increase their chance of colliding with an artificial structure (i.e., fallout). Once on the ground, fledglings are unable to fly and thousands are killed annually by cars, cats, and dogs or die because of starvation or dehydration.178\n\n",

Do people have an obligation to reverse those life-framing alterations? It seems impossible to maintain that position, for reasons that I have already suggested: First of all, it is impossible to know what that reversal could consist in, given the impossibility of unweaving the causal web. Even it were possible to define \u201creversal\u201d, the radical transformational nature of the human influence on the systems involved and the broad spatial extent of the resulting transformations through a long history of startlingly persistent human behaviors and activities would make reversing them an impossibility. One might think that this problem could be ameliorated by aiming at some more recent restoration target \u2013 say, within the range of a human generation\u2019s memory or the generation before that, or before Columbus and his successors began the process of re-creating an ecological Pangaea. But the justification for shooting at any such a target requires some as yet unspecified principle. It is hard to see how any principle could be anything other than arbitrary.",

That is because if an organism is struggling now, one likely cause is that it finds itself in conditions that are a consequence of a very long and complex history of characteristic human activities and projects. While we-now might see ourselves as having a choice to modify some of those activities and projects or to cease and desist from some of them entirely, acting on that choice would not effect any significant change in the conditions that already obtain and that currently define the terms for most every organism\u2019s struggle for existence.

Those capabilities do not, for example, plausibly extend to the saving of most every struggling species. But what about doing what can be done to \u201cmanage\u201d the survival of struggling plants and animals whose ways of life no longer work in the current world? What about putting what few we can in zoos or arboretums? There are many reasons why, I believe, these are very bad ideas. But for this discussion, I will say only that any grounds for the responsibility to do this are seriously or entirely undercut by the fact that such heroic efforts at best achieve a temporary and brief extension of \u201clife\u201d for a vanishingly small number of the \u201cliving dead\u201d. And the cost of that temporary reprieve for these few is often a life that those living-dead individuals must live, which is in significant ways incongruent with the way of life for their kind.",

But this argument focuses far too narrowly on the last proximate act leading up to extinction. The moral significance of that act is arguably dwarfed by a longer history of anthropogenic stage-setting, which made the final act an anticlimactic denouement \u2013 the inevitable, because the only possible, resolution of the plot. One can imagine some minor variations in the details of exactly how the final act is played.
