            "text": "Altered protease activity is thought to be important in tumour cell invasion and metastasis, and to have a profound role in angiogenesis. Implicated proteases belong to the serine, metallo-, aspartic and cysteine protease classes. The latter comprises more than 30 protein families [1], including family C1 with mammalian enzymes like cathepsins B and L involved in cancer growth and metastasis [2] . Since the involvement of cathepsin B in cancer metastasis was originally described by Sloane et al. [3], cathepsins, and especially cathepsin B, have been studied thoroughly. The activity of the C1 family of cysteine proteases is balanced by tight-binding inhibitors, the cystatins [4]. The cystatin protein family comprises three major groups of inhibitors: type 1 cystatins, also called stefins, which are intracellular proteins present in most cells (cystatin A and B); type 2 cystatins, which are extracellular inhibitors found in most body fluids (cystatin C, D, E \u2044 M, F, G, H, S, SA and SN); and type 3, which are multidomain proteins, the kininogens.

            "text": "Altered protease activity is considered important for tumour invasion and metastasis, processes in which the cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L are involved. Their natural inhibitor cystatin C is a secreted protein, suggesting that it functions to control extracellular protease activity. Because cystatins added to cell cultures can inhibit polio, herpes simplex and coronavirus replication, which are intracellular processes, the internalization and intracellular regulation of cysteine proteases by cystatin C should be considered. The extension, mechanism and biological importance of this hypothetical process are unknown. We investigated whether internalization of cystatin C occurs in a set of human cell lines. Demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, A-431, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468 and Capan-1 cells internalized fluorophore-conjugated cystatin C when exposed to physiological concentrations (1 lm) . During cystatin C incubation, intracellular cystatin C increased after 5 min and accumulated for at least 6 h, reaching four to six times the baseline level. Western blotting showed that the internalized inhibitor was not degraded. It was functionally intact and extracts of cells exposed to cystatin C showed a higher capacity to inhibit papain and cathepsin B than control cells (decrease in enzyme activity of 34% and 37%, respectively). The uptake of labelled cystatin C was inhibited by unlabelled inhibitor, suggesting a specific pathway for the internalization. We conclude that the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C is internalized in significant quantities in various cancer cell lines. This is a potentially important physiological phenomenon not previously described for this group of inhibitors.",

However, the results are conflicting, depending on the type of cystatin and the cancer cell system studied. Overexpression of cystatin C has been shown to alter the metastatic properties of B16F10 melanoma cells [9] and to inhibit the motility and in vitro invasiveness of B16F10 [10] and SCC-VII squamous carcinoma cells [11] . In vitro cystatin E \u2044 M has been found to diminish human breast carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, Matrigel invasion and adhesion to endothelial cells [12] . Cystatin E \u2044 M has been proposed as a candidate tumour suppressor gene for breast cancer [13] .

A reasonable explanation for the inhibition of virus replication by the cysteine protease inhibitors is the inhibition of proteases involved in processing proteins coded by the virus genome, which is an intracellular process. However, the extension of the capacity for cellular uptake of cystatins, the mechanism by which uptake takes place and the biological importance of this hypothetical process are unknown.

In order to allow us to delineate any potential uptake mechanism we also selected two mammary cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468) which, according to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), express different cell surface receptors.

In this study 1 lm cystatin C was used, as this is within the physiological concentration range in different human body fluids (0.1-4 lm) [20] . Following incubation with cystatin C, cells were detached from the bottom of the wells by trypsin, which also meant that labelled protein attached to the cell surface was cleaved and could be washed away. Flow cytometry using the fluorophore Alexa-488 as the protein label was used in these experiments. The resulting scattergram showed a dominating, easily defined group of cells that could be gated (Fig. 1A) . Typically < 15% of the events were excluded. The reproducibility of the experiments was high and internalization of the labelled protein could be demonstrated easily (Fig. 1B) . All five human cancer cell lines internalized Alexa-488-labelled cystatin C ( Fig. 2A-C) . Incubation for 10 s was used to ensure that the washing conditions were sufficient, and demonstrated that cystatin bound at the cell surface was cleaved by trypsin and washed away. After 5 min an increase in some of the cell lines could be detected and after 30 min the cell fluorescence had increased in all five strains. The pattern of internalization was more or less equal in the five strains. Two unrelated proteins acting as protein inhibitors, potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI; 4.3 kDa) and equistatin (22.3 kDa), were studied for comparison. Compared with cystatin C, a very low level of uptake of these molecules was detected in the different cell lines. To investigate whether the internalization of cystatin C was an active process, a similar experiment was carried out at 4\u00b0C. None of the three cell lines tested showed any uptake of labelled cystatin C under these conditions ( Fig. 2C-E) .",

A-431 cells were selected initially because they showed negligible auto-fluorescence when incubated for 6 h with 5 lm Alexa-488-labelled cystatin C. In principle, all cells possessed detectable cystatin C labelling. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses further demonstrated that cystatin C was present within the cells, in both cell bodies and processes, but was not detected in the plasma membrane. A large number of A-431 and MCF-7 cells (Figs 3A and S1) showed widespread low-signal cystatin C fluorescence in the cytoplasm, although fewer also contained larger fluorescence accumulations (in 10% of the cells). Similar intracellular localization of cystatin C was detected when cells were exposed to unlabelled cystatin C followed by immunolabelling of the cystatin C (endogenous and internalized), using a primary antibody against cystatin C and a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa-568 fluorophore (Fig. S2 ). There was no fluorescence labelling in control cells or in cells used in antibody specificity tests (see Experimental procedures for a description of the control experiments). Live imaging experiments clearly showed uptake within 5 min and the Alexa-488labelled cystatin C co-localized with lysosome-like structures stained by LysoTracker (Fig. 3B-D) .",

The other, N39K-cystatin C, lacks inhibitory activity against the C13 family cysteine protease, legumain, because of removal of the key amino acid in the legumain-binding site of cystatin C [22] . The amino acid substitutions reside in opposing parts of the cystatin C molecule, which makes these protein variants interesting. Experiments were carried out in cells from a human pancreas Capan-1 cells were incubated with 1 lM recombinant human cystatin C for up to 6 h. The cystatin C content of the cell extract (representing intracellular cystatin C) was quantified by ELISA and the cystatin C level was correlated to the protein content of the cell lysate. The lines are drawn through the average value of the three wells at each time point (at 5 min only two wells were measured). The result presented is representative for two identical experiments.

The human cancer cell lines chosen included one epidermoid carcinoma cell line, three mammary tumour cell lines and one human pancreas adenocarcinoma. All five cell lines exhibited cystatin C internalization when exposed to extracellular cystatin C. In most experiments uptake could be detected after 30 min, but in some cases it could be seen after 5 min. The uptake curves were very similar in the cell strains studied and showed that all cells exhibited fluorescence after 6 h exposure to 1 lm fluorescence-conjugated cystatin C. In addition, flow cytometry recorded that the uptake of a specific labelled protein in one specific cell strain was highly reproducible within, as well as between, runs. However, the fluorometric method used to measure the degree of protein labelling is not precise, although it provides a good estimate, and detailed comparisons of the quantity of uptake can therefore not be concluded. The lack of uptake in experiments carried out at 4\u00b0C, as well as the competition experiments supported the idea that internalization is an active process and not a passive flow of molecules into the cells [24] , thus suggesting receptor-mediated uptake.",

In the MCF-7 and A-431 cell lines, CLSM demonstrated that internalized cystatin C was distributed through all parts of the cytoplasm, visualized as both smaller and larger accumulations. In addition, CLSM analyses indicated that 10% of the cells contained relatively high levels of cystatin C, which appeared to be localized in discrete cellular compartments, co-localized with LysoTracker, thus indicating localization in acidic compartments such as lysosomes. Differences between cell types were also observed in the amount of cystatin C uptake and \u2044 or its intracellular localization. The heterogeneous cell morphology shown by microscopy further supports that subpopulations of cells possess different abilities in cystatin C uptake.",

This suggests that cystatin C constitutes 1% of the total cysteine protease inhibitor capacity in cells grown in medium, which is reasonable because cystatin A and B are the dominating intracellular, cytoplasmatic, cysteine protease inhibitors [4] . After 24 h exposure to 1 lm cystatin C the total cysteine protease inhibitor capacity as well as the cystatin C concentration of the cells increased. As indicated by the experiment in which the uptake was measured by ELISA, the cystatin C level increased at least fivefold (Fig. 5) . Thus, internalized cystatin C appears to influence the balance between proteases and their inhibitors in cancer metastasis and growth, particularly when considering that it is a more efficient cathepsin B inhibitor than are cystatins A and B. It is possible that the intracellular increase in inhibitory capacity has an even greater impact on this balance than is suspected at first, because the cystatin molecules responsible for the increase are probably localized to, and hence concentrated in, just some cell compartments (e.g. endosomes).",

It seems possible that internalization will also be seen in normal cells, i.e. it is a general, physiological phenomenon, but this has to be investigated further. In conclusion, by using cell culture experiments and flow cytometry we were able to convincingly demonstrate that the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C is internalized in all five of the cancer cell lines investigated in this study. Using confocal microscopy, western blotting and quantification by ELISA, internalization of the cysteine inhibitor was verified and further delineated. Previously, target enzymes of this cysteine protease inhibitor have been shown to be involved in cell invasion and metastasis in cancer, and the cystatins have also been proposed to inhibit virus replication in cell cultures. Our findings open conceptually new lines of research in order to further elucidate the extension, the mechanism and the biological importance of this phenomenon.",

To measure the capacity of the cell lysate to inhibit papain, 88 lL buffer mix as above, containing 5 lL papain (1 lgAEmL )1 ), was used, to which 5 lL of the cell lysate was added. The mixture was allowed to incubate for 10 min before the addition of 7 lL substrate (Z-Phe-Arg-AMC; 200 lm). As positive and negative controls, instead of cell lysate, 5 lL of 0.10 lm E-64 or 5 lL of 0.01% Brij-35 was used, respectively. Fluorescence was measured in a plate reader at the start and end of a 30-min incubation, as above. To measure the inhibition of cathepsin B (kindly provided by J. Mort, Shriners Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), 83 lL buffer mix as above, containing 5 lL cathepsin B (20 nm) and 10 lL cell lysate was used. As positive and negative controls, instead of cell lysate, 10 lL of 0.10 lm E-64 or 10 lL of 0.01% Brij-35 was used. The mixture was allowed to incubate for 10 min before the addition of 7 lL of substrate (Z-Phe-Arg-AMC; 200 lm).",
