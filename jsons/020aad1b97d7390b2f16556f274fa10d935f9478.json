The first ORF encodes the nonstructural proteins, which include three or four proteases, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a helicase and an endonuclease, while ORFs 2-5 encode glycosylated membrane proteins (GP2, E and GP3-GP5), ORF6 encodes the nonglycosylated membrane (M) protein and ORF7 encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998; Wieringa et al., 2004) . In electron micrographs arterivirus virions appear as smooth roughly spherical or oblong particles with a diameter of about 60 nm (Horzinek, 1981; Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998; Wieringa et al., 2004) . The major components of the envelope are GP5 and M, which form disulfide-linked heterodimers and are essential for virion assembly (Snijder et al., 2003; Wieringa et al., 2004) . GP5 may also be involved in receptor binding, but the minor envelope proteins are essential for infectivity and may be the main determinants for tropism (Dobbe et al., 2001) . Replication and assembly occur at internal membranes and are probably driven by interactions between N and the envelope proteins (Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998) .",

An X-ray fluorescence scan was performed to ascertain the Se edge and anomalous scattering factors were calculated using the program CHOOCH (Evans & Pettifer, 2001) . A total of 489 frames of data were collected on a MAR Mosaic 225 CCD area detector at the experimentally determined selenium absorption-edge peak energy (12.67587 keV, 0.9781 \u00c5 ) with an oscillation angle of 1.0 . The data were integrated and scaled using the programs XDS (Kabsch, 1993) and SCALA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) , giving a data set with a redundancy of 19.5 and an overall R merge of 7.9% (Table 1 ). The crystals belonged to space group C222 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 68.23, b = 73.23, c = 138.60 \u00c5 , corresponding to two dimers in the asymmetric unit with V M = 2.78 \u00c5 3 Da \u00c01 . The selenomethionine-derivative crystals showed a high degree of mosaicity (>2 ), with usable data extending to about 2.0 \u00c5 resolution. Initial phasing was performed with SHELXE (Sheldrick, 2002) followed by fourfold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, and solvent flattening was performed using DM (Cowtan & Main, 1998) . The resulting map could be readily interpreted by comparison with the PRRSV-N\u00c157 structure and most of the A, B, C and D subunits were built automatically using ARP/wARP (Morris et al., 2003) . Further model building was performed with O (Jones et al., 1991) and refinement was performed using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) . Initial rounds of refinement used NCS restraints, which were relaxed in the final rounds. The final model has R cryst = 0.219 and R free = 0.248 (Table 1) .",

Likewise, the AB dimer could be superimposed on the CD dimer with an r.m.s.d. of 0.7 \u00c5 . Nevertheless, there is some variation, primarily localized to residues Ala83-Gly86 which form the loop between -strands 1 and 2 (the '-loop'), and to a lesser extent in the N-and C-terminal -helices (Fig. 3b) . Indeed, the electron density for the -loop was poor in subunits A and D, presumably reflecting their exposed location on the outside of the tetramer. Such variation could potentially reflect the conformational variability required for the assembly of an icosahedral shell with more than 60 subunits (Caspar & Klug, 1962; Dokland, 2000) . The flexibility in the subunits is also reflected in the B factors. The greatest mobility is found in the C-terminal helix 3, as well as in the variable -loop (Fig. 3c) . However, there are clear differences in the degree of mobility in the four subunits. Overall, subunit D is far more mobile than the other three. The B factor in 3 of subunit D is as high as 72.2 \u00c5 2 , compared with a mean B factor of 32.2 \u00c5 2 for the whole structure. In addition, there is a flexible region in the part of subunit C that forms the outer surface of the tetramer. This mobility is a consequence of the lack of contacts between the CD dimer and the symmetry-related CD at this end of the tetramer. In contrast, the AB dimer, which forms strong contacts with the symmetry-related AB dimer across the crystal twofold axis at this end of the molecule (see below), displays much lower mobility at the equivalent molecular interface (Fig. 3c) .",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have much larger nucleocapsid proteins than arteriviruses: up to 422 residues in the case of SARS-CoV. An arterivirus-like nucleocapsid domain was recently discovered in the C-terminal dimerization domains of the nucleocapsid proteins from the coronaviruses IBV and SARS-CoV (Chang et al., 2005; Jayaram et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2006) . In these structures, the orientation of the -helices relative to the -sheet differs from that in EAV and PRRSV, but the topology is the same and could be classified as the 'nidoviral nucleocapsid fold'. Thus, the evolutionary relationships between arteriviruses and coronaviruses evidenced by the similar organization of the genomes is also reflected in the nucleocapsid protein structures and will probably also be reflected in other viral protein structures. The nidoviral nucleocapsid fold differs from the nucleocapsid proteins of both the flaviviruses (Dokland et al., 2004) and the alphaviruses (Choi et al., 1997) .",

In this model, the -sheet of the dimer would face the inside of the shell, where the N-terminal domains would be positioned to interact with the RNA (Fig. 5a) . The -helical outer surface might form a docking site for the envelope proteins, most likely the endodomains of the major envelope proteins M and/ or GP5 (Fig. 5a ; Doan & Dokland, 2003b) .

This tetramer is almost identical to that formed by the AB dimer and the A 0 B 0 dimer related by the crystallographic twofold axis (Figs. 3e and 3f) . It is tempting to suggest that the tetramer comprises the building block for the shell and that the quasi-equivalence between these two types of tetramers reflects the organization of the N protein in the virus. For example, we might build a shell with a diameter of around 31-38 nm from 360 copies of N (Fig. 5b) . However, there is currently no experimental evidence to support this model and crystal contacts are not necessarily an indicator of in vivo interactions. Confirmation of this model would have to await characterization of the arterivirus structure by cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction.",
