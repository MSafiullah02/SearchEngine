            "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic viral disease with a high mortality. CCHF is caused by Nairovirus, which is an RNA-type virus from the Bunyaviridae family. It is generally transmitted through the bite of vectors, such as ticks. Although rare, infection with CCHF has also been reported in health care professionals as a result of contact with blood and blood products. Non-specific symptoms such as fever, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and myalgia might occur after contact with infected blood. In addition to these non-specific symptoms, bruising, petechiae, vaginal bleeding, and epistaxis as well as signs of intracranial, gastrointestinal, and alveolar hemorrhage that may be life threatening and often responsible for mortality might occur. The mortality rate due to CCHF ranges from 3 to 80 %. The disease was named Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever after the first case of the disease was seen in Crimea in 1944 and a similar case was reported in Congo 12 years later. Furthermore, it is endemic in many parts of the world. In literature, the CCHF cases from about 30 countries encompassing Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East have been reported, with the number of cases increasing each year (Karti 2009; Erg\u00f6n\u00fcl 2006).",

In all of these studies, lung evaluations were performed based on the plain radiography and to the best of our knowledge, there are no other studies performed with thorax CT. In 2007 a study from Russia by Sannikova et al. was the first study that evaluated lung findings in CCHF. In their study, lung findings of 283 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were defined and it was noted that these symptoms could be seen in all periods, most notably in the hemorrhagic phase. In addition, they concluded that ARDS symptoms that may occur throughout the course of the disease are closely associated with systemic inflammation and that this clinical condition may accompany hemorrhagic symptoms (Sannikova et al. 2007). In 2012, a Turkish study by Bilgin et al. evaluated lung findings of 128 CCHF patients, retrospectively. The most frequently detected pulmonary symptoms were cough, sputum, and chest pain. In addition, they reported that there was no significant difference between patients with and without radiological findings in terms of survival. In the majority of patients (65.5 %) that had radiological findings, these findings were bilateral. However, the study only evaluated direct radiography findings and abnormal findings that were detected included infiltration, hilar pathology, interstitial pathology, pleural thickening, and pleural effusion (Bilgin et al. 2014). Another study that evaluated lung findings of CCHF was done by Do\u011fan et al. in 2011. The study assessed demographic, clinical, and radiological parameters as well as pulmonary symptoms of 108 patients diagnosed with CCHF. Similar to the aforementioned studies, the radiological assessments were done based on the direct radiography findings. Abnormal findings in direct radiography were not detected in 66.7 % of patients. On the other hand, the majority of the radiological findings detected in direct radiography were unilateral (Dogan et al. 2011). In literature, there are single case reports for both pediatric and adult cases that used direct radiography and thorax CT to evaluate lung findings. Pleural effusion was found in almost all case reports and is the most frequent as well as the most well defined radiological finding in CCHF patients in literature. Although, the precise pathophysiological mechanisms of pleural effusion are not known, it is widely thought to develop as a result of widespread systemic inflammation. However, it is recommended that differential diagnosis of hemothorax should be included. It is suggested that the pleural effusion that develops in the course of the disease is not associated with hemothorax (Schnittler and Feldmann 2003; Feldman et al. 2003; Tanir et al. 2009). In Do\u011fanc\u0131 et al.\u2019s case report from Turkey, a young adult diagnosed with CCHF had an alveolar hemorrhage at the time of admission to the hospital, which regressed dramatically on day 5 after ribavirin and supportive treatment (Doganci et al. 2008). Although the authors suggested that excessive inflammatory response was the reason, it remains unclear whether thrombocytopenia and/or vascular injury might have been the main factors in the pathophysiology.",

In our study, the patients underwent thorax CT for further diagnosis due to the emergence of new findings in the pre-hemorrhagic and hemorrhagic phase at the time of admission and/or during the clinical follow-up. Radiological findings suspected to be pulmonary pathologies of CCHF were seen in all patients. Inadequacies in the differential diagnosis and further investigations may occur, especially in the pre-hemorrhagic phase because patients come in with symptoms similar to the common cold. In particular, the most frequently seen thorax CT findings, such as parenchymal infiltration, alveolar infiltration, pleural effusion, and atelectasis, are significantly related with survival which in turn, emphasizes the importance of these parameters in clinical follow-up. In addition, if these findings develop in advanced stages of the disease, such as hemorrhagic and convalescent phases, they might serve as indicators of poor prognosis.",

In all previous studies only direct radiography was used for the assessment of the lung and none of them felt the need to use thorax CT for advanced diagnosis. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate the adequacy of direct radiography in the assessment of the lung findings in patients with CCHF. The direct radiography can detect the radiological findings most frequently seen in thorax CT such as pleural effusion, alveolar, and parenchymal infiltration. The correlation between direct radiography and thorax CT in terms of detection of radiologically similar findings was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This suggests that it is more appropriate to use simple, cheap, and easily accessible direct lung radiography in the initial diagnosis of CCHF, however in cases with additional pathological findings, differential diagnosis or the absence of clinical improvement thorax CT should be used for further examination in clinical follow-up. Therefore, CXR should be considered especially in patients in the hemorrhagic phase for detection of pulmonary pathologies such as alveolar hemorrhage and pleural effusion, while thorax CT should be considered for further evaluation. Moreover, it should be deliberated that the pre-hemorrhagic phase, in which the symptoms emerge, will be followed by the hemorrhagic phase when the clinical manifestations could occur, and thus radiological assessment of the lungs should be carried out after the admission to the hospital. This radiological evaluation will be very useful in terms of calculating both the survival and the clinical course of the disease.",

Furthermore, the number of deaths due to CCHF is increasing every year. In CCHF, the intense inflammatory response affects all systems, including the circulation and hematological system and clinical implications of the liver as well. However, information regarding effects on the respiratory system is very limited. In particular, the information regarding the radiologic evaluations and findings for this disease is insufficient. In cases with life-threatening clinical conditions it is important to evaluate radiological findings in the respiratory system by using direct radiography and by using thorax CT when differential and advance diagnosis is needed. We also would like to emphasize that both direct radiography and thorax CT are highly successful in detecting frequently encountered radiological findings such as pleural effusion, alveolar hemorrhage, and parenchymal infiltration that indicate pulmonary involvement and have a negative effect on survival and therefore should be used in the evaluation of patients with CCHF.",
