I certainly have worked with patients who are supposed to be doing our visits through our medical records system but are experiencing access challenges. Some patients cannot access the Internet, and they do not have the bandwidth to do that kind of visit. I have done phone visits with some patients, and I really hope that we can also move that forward as an option when video visits for mental health support are not possible. That has historically been something that has not been compensated as well, to do phone visits, and I really hope that is something now that payers will start to think about as important. The telephone visits have gone very well. But even there, again, a patient may experience inequity, because there are some patients who do not have a reliable phone or a secure private place to talk. This is particularly true as families are being forced to stay home. So still some patients are not able to talk as openly about their mental health needs and about stress they are facing if they cannot find privacy. For example, this is certainly relevant as we are seeing the increases in intimate partner violence some individuals are facing in their ''shelter-inplace'' housing situations. So, by moving all these things to telehealth, I think we have to be cognizant that some patients are not going to be able to access those things, and so in some ways, we are taking away barriers from people getting access to mental health care, but I also think we are also highlighting some increased barriers for some individuals.",

How do you all think implicit bias is playing into the conversations that have no criteria for anybody else in the room? So some well-meaning provider potentially is steering black and brown and colored and other disparate populations toward DNRs. What do you think about that? DR. MOUTON: I think that implicit bias is, as they say, a real and present danger. I think providers are well meaning, but they are still making judgments. When thinking about people's ability to recover when they have comorbid conditions, it is important to bear in mind that those comorbid conditions are often a reflection of social inequities and society. And now, providers are having to tell these patients with certain comorbidities that when they need a health care resource, they may be ineligible. Is that compounding the inequities that already exist? I think it is a difficult question. Ethicists continue to debate the proper distribution of resources during times of scarcity. 12 But, again, I am convinced that our own implicit biases influence how we make judgments and decisions. I worry that these biases will potentially lead to greater inequities as this crisis moves forward. More importantly, some of the policies and processes that are being put in place to deal with resource scarcity caused by the COVID-19 crisis may wind up becoming the new standard that we turn to when making these kinds of decisions, so it is concerning.",

When it comes down to it during times of really tight constraints like what people are experiencing right now, decisions are indeed being made about who is going to receive care and who is not, and who is going to receive what could be considered lifesaving care and who is not. Unfortunately, racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to have conditions that put them at greater risk for severe complications. Right now, with COVID-19, underlying conditions that could prove to make outcomes worse could include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or asthma. 15 We already know that racial and ethnic minorities have a disproportionate burden of illness and death. 16 The ethicists certainly have their jobs cut out for them. Even though this is the first major pandemic we have had since 1918, it is not to say that we will not be dealing with another issue in the future wherein we are going to have to deal with major constraints and burdens to our existing health care facilities.",

Important decisions are having to be made right now in almost a fight-or-flight mode, and those may tend to be even more likely wrought with implicit and unconscious bias. Because there is already so much bias against mental health, that is just adding another layer of complexity. As much as people are saying that we understand how stressful this is, I do not know that people always still really do fully understand. I just read an article on a Website about finding a therapist during this time, and it tries to give a number of resources no matter your insurance or need. 17 However, our system is still very much biased against those needing mental health support and set up for self-pay. Although telehealth opens new avenues, it still is going to be more accessible for those who can afford to pay a therapist online through numerous services popping up to take advantage. Those who cannot afford these services will still have to deal with the same biases such as mental health care not always as covered as other health care needs. We are all bringing bias about what is needed and how to use resources appropriately.",

What do you think are some of the best practices that you think are being underutilized, and what do you see as really the stopgaps or policies that we need to implement as a part of the standard of care? DR. MOUTON: There is a major economic gap within the health care sector. Inner city and rural provider practice differ substantially in the financial resources they have available to reinvest in new practice technologies. I think that as we try to use technology to provide access to health care, without policy guidance and financial support, particularly from CMS, there will be a number of obstacles. If telehealth is here to stay, which most people say it is, then coupled with the expansion in digital health care monitoring, such as using the Internet of Things in people's homes to support better monitoring, we can start to see an intensification of the inequities for the communities served by these practices.

MOUTON: Well, right now the issue is that incentives are driven by the economic forces. As you move the economic forces out of the industry and say that we will deploy people where the need is the greatest, and they will be paid substantially the same or with some increased benefit for taking on those assignments, then that would be different. Now, I am not saying that a universal one-payer health care system will necessarily do that, but it might. I have to study the distribution issues in Canada and in England to see how their systems work, but I think they are better prepared. People may argue about whether or not that is true. I think part of our issue is that economic factors drive where physicians live, practice, what specialty they choose, and what geographic area they live in. And without economics being the main motivating factor, figuring out how to distribute the health care workforce in a manner that takes that away, you could have a situation wherein people will choose to work in environments that give them better economic fulfillment.",
