Previous reports have suggested an association between long wait times for CATH and increased mortality and morbidity [5]. In addition, long wait times are associated with anxiety in people needing a CATH, resulting in a decrease in quality of life [4].",

Based on the research outlined above, the local monitoring organization (Cardiac Care Network of Ontario (CCN)) established benchmark RMWTs of 0\u20137, 8\u201328, and 28\u201384 days for urgent, semi-urgent, and elective patients undergoing CATH in Ontario, respectively [8].

Physical capacity improvements (e.g. additional laboratories, new centres, staff increases), and system design (e.g. advanced booking and queuing strategies) may allow for more cases to be completed, and thus decreasing wait for service [9]. Other factors, such as changes in practice, changes in population demographics, the emergence of new technologies (e.g. cardiac computed tomography), and public health crises (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)) may direct patients towards or away from the cardiac catheterization laboratory; affecting the wait list in a less predictable manner. The understanding of how much these factors can influence delivery of cardiac services may be enhanced by the collection of data regarding the patient population in need (e.g. patient registries). Registry data has been used to develop models for improving wait times through eliminating inefficiencies in service delivery by optimizing patient throughput [9]. However, improved efficiency can only do so much, and additional resources may be necessary when squeezing the maximum capacity from existing resources is optimized.",

This document acknowledged the lack of adequate data/information at the time as a barrier to planning, and listed among their recommendations the expansion of patient monitoring systems. Because data was limited, many of the task force recommendations may not have been adequate to meet the needs of some cardiac patient populations in Ontario. Since the release of this report, some health care providers in Ontario have developed patient registries, thus improving on the previous lack of data. Registry data may provide an observational database in which to examine both factors that increase need for service and those which improve our ability to meet that demand. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate (with registry data) our experience over the past decade in attempting to meet RMWTs for patients needing CATH at our centre, and discuss issues concerning capacity planning (or lack of it) in providing timely service.",

Only cardiologists, surgeons, and special internists can make a direct referral. In addition, elective and semi-urgent patients are required to undergo a triage process with a specially trained nurse coordinator. If deemed appropriate by the triage nurse, the patient is required to attend a pre-catheterization clinic with a designated cardiac nurse clinician. In consultation with the cardiologist scheduled to perform the procedure, the triage nurse can remove referred patients deemed inappropriate from the waitlist.

Both inpatient and outpatient mean wait times calculated for each year in the observation period were compared to the RMWT outlined by the local guidelines. As a subsequent focus we identified potential factors that increased the number of patient referrals to our centre (capacity stressors), and those improving our ability to deliver this service (capacity builders) over the observation period. Particular attention was paid to if and how RMWTs were achieved (especially after the implementation of a 4th laboratory at our centre).

Each of these factors resulted in increased referrals to the catheterization laboratory beyond contemporaneous capacity limits. The first was the widespread utilization of biomarkers (troponins, CK-MB) to assess cardiac injury [12], [13]. Troponin screening lowered the threshold for defining, and thus identifying, the occurrence of a MI. Biomarker utilization coupled with new guidelines for treating patients with acute coronary syndromes [14], [15] increased the number of patients eligible to benefit from referral for CATH. This scenario is reflected in our data with the proportion of patients who suffered a previous MI increasing dramatically from approximately 28% to over 40% each year after 1999. Such may also explain the increase in the number of patients awaiting CATH, the decrease in the proportion of inpatients and outpatients undergoing a catheterization laboratory procedure within the RMWTs, and the mean wait time for service in 2000 when compared to the previous year, as the increased referrals were not met with synchronous capacity improvements (the number of cases performed were similar in both years).",

For instance, if catheterization lab capacity outpaces that for other important diagnostic tests, such as non-invasive cardiac stress and imaging tests, many patients may receive an angiogram before these other tests become available. Often, these diagnostic tests are used to screen patients whom would most benefit from referral to the catheterization laboratory. Without such tests the threshold for referral may decrease, resulting in increased referrals. Conversely, when catheterization laboratory resources are scarce, many patients may be required to undergo multiple non-invasive diagnostics as an alternative in order to better establish the likelihood of disease before referral for CATH. A decrease in the number of referrals may also result because of an increased threshold for evidence pertaining to disease burden prior to referral. Ultimately, this may cause a delay in referral to CATH because the patient is waiting for such tests (which may not be reflected in wait times if referral is after the point when test results are available).",

            "text": "Capacity improvements were achieved most notably by the addition of catheterization laboratories both within our department and in adjacent regions, and the increase in the hours of operation. Both decreases in wait time and increases in the number of cases performed, as compared to the previous year, coincided with the addition of a third and 4th lab in our facility in April 1998 and May 2005, respectively. This trend was also seen (to a lesser extent) with the opening of catheterization laboratories in two regional hospitals, one 50 km (April 1999) and the other 70 km (February 2001) away from our centre. In addition to lab openings, capacity in our centre was potentially improved by four other, primarily systematic, means. First we have observed a change in the same-sitting (ad hoc) rate of PCI, increasing from 59% in 1997 to 90.7% in 2007. By performing the procedure ad hoc we diminished the need to have the patient come back to the lab, effectively eliminating the number of potential future cases, along with the time it takes to prepare the patient and set-up the lab for an additional procedure. Second, by staggering lab start times we were able to effectively extend our hours of service (as of January 2004). This allowed more flexibility for providing care for late day inpatient referrals and emergent cases. Finally, in May 2005 we instituted two changes. One was the opening of a 32-bed recovery and reception area exclusive to the catheterization laboratory. The recovery area provided more flexibility for managing care post-procedure. That is, patients were registered and accepted directly to the HIU independent of availability in our hospital inpatient wards. The other change was mandatory Pre-Cath Clinic attendance for all elective outpatients booked for a procedure at our centre. The clinic took place 3\u20135 days before the procedure. Capacity could improve because the Pre-Cath Clinic staff addressed potential medication and other issues that might otherwise cause a cancellation on the day of the procedure. In addition, the clinic provided education that would otherwise take up CATH laboratory staff time. Although each will logically improve \u201crealized\u201d capacity, many of the above-mentioned changes coincided with laboratory openings, thus it is difficult to ascertain the precise impact on our ability to deliver service (with regards to wait list management and caseload improvements) [9].",

Planning for such changes by policy makers and service providers is limited in that it may be difficult to anticipate changes in practice (prompted by new evidence in the research literature; i.e. acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines, CK-MB and troponin screening), or, even rarer, public health crisis (SARS) that put substantial stress on service capacity; capacity which in our experience was already stretched thin. Our experience suggests that while projecting change may be difficult, prospective collection of data may provide a measure of how service is delivered and specifically, when service is not delivered in a timely manner, and thus, provide quantifiable evidence for a need to improve. That is, by using registry data we were able to estimate the magnitude of improvements to our service delivery by measuring changes in key wait list indicators (in this case RMWT) that followed the implementation of each successive capacity building strategy. Likewise, we were able to estimate the detriment to the timeliness of service delivery each capacity stressor brought. Despite the awareness raised from this data that RMWTs were not being met during this time, the increase in capacity was slow. Reasons for the delay in expansion may have been exacerbated by competing interests for government funding, bureaucratic processes (that delay realized capacity even though funding has been allocated) [9], a lack of standardized methods for monitoring and reporting wait times and wait list lengths, and/or government opinion differing from service providers on the seriousness of wait list problems [18], [19].",

With increasing community need, fixed or moderately increasing resources, and no immediate or transparent plan to expand the number of funded laboratories, the only recourse available to the HIU leadership for improving wait times was to stretch contemporaneous resources for maximal benefit, either through improved efficiencies and system redesign, or less formally, through increasing effective employment (overtime, staggered lab start times). While it can be argued that improving efficiency should be preferred to building a new lab as a method for increasing capacity, our experience shows that the effect of capacity improvements through systematic means (i.e. improved efficiencies and resource management) in absence of additional physical capacity was not enough to allow for a delivery of service within the RMWT. In other words, you can only get so much out of available resources before additional resources must be made available.",

Despite our best efforts, it is evident that we were unable deliver care within the RMWTs for a high majority of outpatients and a significant minority of inpatients referred to our centre until we opened the 4th laboratory (and a self-contained recovery unit registering and admitting overnight patients independent of the hospital ward). The fact that the addition of the 4th laboratory at our centre (with concurrent systematic improvements) resulted in an improvement to greater than 80% of outpatients and almost 100% of inpatients receiving care within RMWT benchmarks indicates that additional physical capacity was needed in our community (compared to <40% of outpatients and <80% of inpatients before expansion). In addition it is evident that, from a service delivery perspective, significant improvements in timely access for outpatients were only achieved by the addition of physical resources (i.e. additional laboratories). It seems that many of the systematic changes, such as increasing hours of operation (most often through the use of overtime), were aimed at improving timely access for inpatients.",

The lesson learned from above analysis is that effective service expansion requires a plan based on benchmarks for care (in this case RMWT). Prospective registries can be an effective way of monitoring these benchmarks. It is essential that planning accommodate expanding or contracting need in a timely manner, such that indicators do not fall too far outside benchmarks for best care. Although improvements were made throughout the period of observation, the desire to improve was driven by a strategy of \u201cputting out fires\u201d rather than by a transparent planning policy based on quantifiable benchmarks. This is evidenced during the observation period, where a capacity builder immediately followed each capacity stressor; where with the exception of the concerted effort in May 2005 bringing simultaneous systematic changes and a 4th laboratory, no attempt was successful in decreasing the wait time to meet RMWTs. CCN currently monitors and reports data available to the public regarding wait times for Ontario CATH laboratories and other cardiac procedures.

For example, the 32-bed unit design helped in decreasing the number of patients on the waitlist. This strategy was exceptionally helpful in situations where laboratory capacity existed, but inpatients were not brought to the laboratory because there was nowhere to manage the patients before and after the procedure. This emphasizes the importance of planning capacity based on patient risk and management rather than procedural capacity alone. The implementation of local registries may assist centres in developing efficiency models based on community needs. Such registries may also be useful in monitoring the appropriateness of referrals. Increases in referrals of patients who would derive little or no benefit by undergoing a diagnostic procedure may result in longer wait times for others on the waitlist. Although our study did not specifically address this issue, strategies to ensure appropriate referral were undertaken at our centre. These included prioritizing patients based on an urgency score (which was developed with data from the registry). As each community may have its own standards, the registry may allow for the ability to improve on its delivery of service by using information specific to the patients it services.",

In order to fully appreciate any observed association between changes in practice/capacity improvements and the degree of access, comparisons with centres in our region that did not implement similar changes (i.e. additional laboratories, biomarker screening, etc.) would have been desirable. Unfortunately, we are not aware of similar registries in our region.

Service delivery is most effective when service providers can anticipate what the community will need before access becomes restricted due to capacity limits. In retrospect, improving access to CATH services in our centre was reactive to the increasing need of the community rather than based on anticipation of need and continuity of service within RMWTs. Still, it may be difficult to know whether emerging technologies, such as cardiac computed tomography, will divert diagnostic cases away from the catheterization laboratory [20], or if the use of this or other modalities will result in more referrals to the catheterization laboratory for purposes of clarification or intervention. In addition, further investigation may be needed to ascertain the impact clinical studies (e.g. COURAGE [21]) on disease management. In light of our experience over the last decade, it is recommended that governments work with researchers, cardiac service providers, and biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry representatives in order to plan for maintaining and improving access to CATH where needed rather than appropriating resources where service is failing to meet demand. It is also recommended that centres develop registries to provide a means of both monitoring changes in access and evaluating the effectiveness of strategies designed to improve timely access.",
