Historically, serum therapy using both animal and human serum sources was widely embraced in the 1890s to 1930s (the preantibiotic era). However, a very significant side effect, known as \u201cserum sickness,\u201d can result. This systemic immune reaction (or Type III hypersensitivity reaction) is characterized by the deposition of antigen\u2010antibody immune complexes, which was suspected as early as 1911 by Clemens von Pirquet.\n21\n After administration of a foreign antigen (such as a horse protein present in horse serum), the patient mounts a humoral response to the antigen. The antibody complexes with its target antigen, deposits in small vessels and joints, activates complement, and instigates inflammatory damage. Clinical disease is characterized by fever, arthralgia, and vasculitis, with dermatologic, renal, and pulmonary manifestations, usually within 6 to 21 days of antigen exposure. The potential severity of this complication, particularly when animal plasma is used, coupled with safer and more predictable drug therapies, foretold the decline of this approach. Modern methods of antibody isolation, purification, and production have heralded the potential resurgence of passive immunotherapy in the form of HIG and therapeutic MoAb.",

The successful immune response is necessarily multifactorial and has been broadly considered as comprising both innate (e.g., phagocytic processes) and adaptive (subdivided into humoral or cell\u2010mediated) components. The relative balance of these processes is both host and pathogen dependent to a certain extent. Passive immune therapy contributes to the humoral response, which derives its pathogen specificity from the precise binding of an antibody to its cognate antigen. Central to an effective adaptive immune response is an overlapping functionality of both humoral (i.e., antibody\u2010based) and cell\u2010mediated components. However, on initial exposure to a pathogen, it can take days to produce the correct type or types of antibody in an adequate concentration for maximal effect, and this ability is host dependent. In the interim, the disease process continues, causing morbidity and mortality. Providing an exogenous pathogen\u2010specific antibody to the patient in this way provides a bridge of passive immunity that can give the host additional time to mount a more effective active response.\n22\n\n",

Since the humoral response is a normal and essential part of the natural immune system, it seems plausible that it is always helpful for the patient to have these pathogen antibodies. Interestingly, this is not always the case. An important phenomenon, called antibody\u2010dependent enhancement (ADE), occurs at subneutralizing concentrations when an antibody serves to actually facilitate viral particle cell entry, rather than result in neutralization.\n76\n The best\u2010characterized human example of this process is Dengue shock syndrome, found in some patients with Dengue virus infection.\n77\n ADE is thought to occur in most cases by the binding of the Fc portion of the antibody to an Fc\u2010receptor on an immune cell (usually a macrophage) or by a complement\u2010mediated mechanism. Importantly, for influenza A, ADE has been demonstrated in vitro in mice\n78\n and in humans.\n79\n However, a clinical syndrome due to enhancement by influenza antibodies has not been characterized in vivo.",

ADE facilitates viral entry into Fc\u2010receptor\u2013bearing cells (such as the antigen\u2010presenting cells that are central to cell\u2010mediated immunity). Since macrophages are not permissive for influenza infection,\n80\n increased viral uptake is unlikely to compromise cell function, but instead may increase viral antigen processing and presentation to T cells. As a result, the presence of cross\u2010reactive, nonneutralizing antibodies may be beneficial in influenza to augment cell\u2010mediated immunity.\n78\n This area should be researched as part of a convalescent plasma program for pandemic influenza, since the impact of transfusing antibodies against influenza on a large scale in human populations has not been established.",

What is the risk of cotransfusion of infectious virus as a result of persistent donor influenza viremia? It is controversial whether influenza viremia routinely occurs during natural infection,\n81\n and although patients with influenza viremia have been reported, the question has not been extensively studied. It is thought that seasonal influenza \u201cwould not pose a large risk to the safety of the blood supply,\u201d\n82\n but since viral load and viremia rates can differ by strain (e.g., as high as 56% with H5N1 [9 of 16 patients]),\n83\n a more clinically severe virus could. A conservative approach might be deferring donors at least 2 weeks after their last fever, but evidence on this question is lacking. Since influenza is an enveloped orthomyxovirus, deriving its lipid membrane from the host cell upon the completion of virion formation, it is susceptible to the process of S/D treatment and other pathogen reduction processes. However, these processes take time and are not readily available in most blood centers. Another option would be nanofiltration of individual donations;\n84\n however, this process is too specialized for widespread application in the field. A critical advantage of convalescent serotherapy is its community\u2010based, local application (i.e., using plasma from donors in close proximity to patients who may be suffering from infection by the same viral strain) and this benefit could be lost if a centralized manufacturing step were necessary.",

When picturing a more severe pandemic, one must wonder how convalescent transfusion could ever be tenable on a large scale if some planning has not occurred. Even with the great deal of unknowns associated with a pandemic, planning is still a priority. During the height of a pandemic, when times are difficult, it is probably too late to attempt to generate new protocols. Consequently, lines of communication need to be opened and well established now, and test exercises should be performed or designed. In other facets of pandemic planning, a guiding philosophy is that it is better to be caught prepared than not; so too is it better to have planned for a model of FCP\u2010Flu collection and distribution and not use it than to realize one could have an effective intervention, but no practical way to collect and distribute a much\u2010needed product.",
