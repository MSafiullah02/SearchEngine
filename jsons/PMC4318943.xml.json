Between October 2008 and April 2013, 367 subjects were enrolled. Healthy subjects living in Galveston County were recruited from the newborn nursery or primary care pediatric clinics at UTMB. Preterm infants and those with major medical problems or anatomical/physiological defects of the ear or nasopharynx were excluded.

Parents were encouraged to bring the subject in for examination any time they suspected the infant might have an ear infection. AOM diagnosis was made based on presentations of acute symptoms (fever, irritability, otalgia), signs of tympanic membrane inflammation (intense redness, bulging, opaque tympanic membrane), and presence of middle ear fluid as documented by pneumatic otoscopy and/or tympanometry.

Because viruses are intracellular microorganisms, detection of viruses in clinical specimens suggest replication of viruses in the host cells; thus, the term \u201cinfection\u201d is appropriate regardless of symptoms. We defined \u201casymptomatic infection\u201d by a 7-day symptom-free period before and after specimen collection; this history was carefully obtained from both parents and medical record review. This study is unique in that we utilized longitudinal data from the same infant to distinguish a new infection from repeated detection due to prolonged presence of virus nucleic acid in the respiratory tract. We used a 30-day time frame to separate the 2 situations for uniformity with previous reports [14, 15]. We are aware that survival of nucleic acid in the respiratory tract may vary depending on the virus species identified [15, 16]. Therefore, some of the defined asymptomatic viral infections in this study could still be from prolonged presence (>30 days) of viral nucleic acids in the respiratory tract. To ascertain \u201cnew\u201d viral infection in a successive series of positive detections of the same virus over time, sequencing of the detected viruses will be required but is beyond the scope of this report.",

Interestingly, URTI symptoms in the first year of life associated with increasing age (eg, infants 6\u201312 months of age expressed more symptoms than younger infants). Consistent with our finding, studies of older children [8, 17, 18] found that the ages of 6\u201312 months were a risk factor for symptoms. Collectively, these data indicate that 6- to 12-month-old infants are more likely to express symptoms than younger infants or older children. It is well known that young infants express less specific symptoms when they are ill and they are less susceptible to infections due to preexisting maternal antibodies, which wane with age. Older infants had more frequent single and multiple virus detection. Increased exposure to infections in older infants likely increases infection by multiple viruses. This may also contribute to symptom expression in older infants; association of multiple viral infections and symptoms/severity has previously been documented [8, 19, 20].",

Miller et al [21] recently reported similar findings in 175 URTI episodes in infants (<12 months) over 4 consecutive years. Our study also showed positive correlations between rhinovirus, symptoms, and AOM development. Other viruses highly associated with symptoms included RSV, influenza, and metapneumovirus; the seasonality of these 3 viruses may explain the higher rate of symptomatic infection during winter respiratory season and higher rate of asymptomatic infection from April to August. A recent case-control study performed in Sweden in children aged <5 years during non\u2013influenza season also showed high proportion of RSV and metapneumovirus in symptomatic cases [22]. Prolonged presence of bocavirus may partially explain a lack of association between symptoms and this virus detection [23].",

Our finding that asymptomatic viral infection did not lead to AOM highlights the fact that a necessary step in the pathogenesis of AOM is an inflammation of the nasopharynx and the Eustachian tubes severe enough to cause URTI symptoms and associated Eustachian tube dysfunction. We clearly showed a strong correlation between expression of URTI symptoms and high viral load for all viruses except for influenza, which only accounted for a small number. Others have also shown the correlation between viral load and symptom severity of specific viruses [23\u201326]. It is interesting that the development of AOM was not associated with a higher viral load during URTI. In previous studies of an older cohort, we have also shown a lack of association between AOM complication and high viral load in metapneumovirus and bocavirus URTI [27, 28]. It is possible that viral load has lesser importance on the development of AOM when considered along with other known AOM risk factors such as demographic and genetic risks, feeding status, daycare attendance, nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization, pneumococcal antibody status, and type of URTI virus [2, 12, 29, 30].",
