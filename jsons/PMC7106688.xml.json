Cancer patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation have been the subject of only two previous studies. Shih and colleagues reviewed cancer patients who required mechanical ventilation for > 21 days in Taiwan from 1998 to 2007. Half of these patients survived < 1.4 months, and the 1-year overall survival was 14% [2]. In Taiwan, care may not be withdrawn, limiting the application of this work to other populations in which care may be withdrawn if it is believed to be futile. Soares et al. performed a retrospective review of a single institution\u2019s experience with 163 cancer patients requiring > 21 days of mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy in an intensive care unit (ICU), essentially all of whom required mechanical ventilatory support [3]. However, the duration of the need for mechanical ventilation was not provided. The hospital and 6-month survivals were 49 and 40%, respectively, for patients in this study.",

The goal of this study was to characterize the results achieved, focusing on the likelihood of weaning and on overall survival. Two patient cohorts were examined. The first group was cared for between 2008 and 2011, a period that was chosen so that a comparison between patients receiving care before and after creation of a dedicated weaning unit could be performed. The second group was cared for between January and December 2018, a period chosen because it represents contemporary practice and provides sufficient time for clinical follow-up to estimate long-term outcomes.",

Pediatric (< 18 years of age) and neurological patients were not included. During the initial 2 years of the study period (2008\u20132009), the primary responsibility for care of patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation after ICU discharge was by the service that had initially admitted the patient to the hospital on their primary floor. In 2010, the surgical advanced care unit (SACU) was created. Under the SACU program, all patients treated with prolonged mechanical ventilation after discharge from the ICU were transferred to the care of the General Medicine Service. A coordinated program of care was delivered, organized around daily rounds attended by the SACU nurse practitioners and registered nurses, the General Medicine attending, and the Pulmonary Medicine attending, as well as representatives from the previous primary service, Respiratory Therapy, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Social Work, and Case Management.",

By use of the Kaplan-Meier method, overall survival was calculated from the time of ICU discharge until the date of death or was censored on the date of last clinical contact. Weaning status was treated as a time-dependent covariate: all patients began as \u201cnot weaned\u201d upon ICU discharge, and the weaning status changed to \u201cweaned\u201d on the date of first documentation of weaning, if applicable. Comparisons of overall survival by group were made using the log-rank test. Cox regression was used for univariable and multivariable analyses to estimate the hazard of death based on weaning statuses, with adjustment for demographic and clinical variables. Factors included care in the SACU, age on initiation of ventilatory support outside of the ICU, sex, cancer status (active versus no evidence of disease), tumor histology (solid versus liquid), and number of days on mechanical ventilation while in the ICU. Time to weaning, defined as the number of months between ICU discharge and first documentation of successful weaning, was analyzed using a competing risks approach. Death without having been weaned was treated as a competing risk event. Cumulative incidence functions for each competing event were calculated using competing risks methodology [4]. Fine and Gray\u2019s competing risk regressions for the sub-hazard ratio [5] were used to evaluate any patient, tumor, or treatment characteristic that was associated with the incidence of weaning. We derived the conditional probability of weaning in the presence of a competing risk (death without having been weaned) in a period, assuming the surviving patient was not yet weaned at the beginning of the period [6]. Analyses were conducted using R 3.1.1 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). All statistical tests were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.",

            "text": "Efforts to improve long-term outcomes after prolonged mechanical ventilation have been reported. Daly et al. [10] reported a prospective randomized trial of patients cared for either by a disease management team (DMT)\u2014including nurse practitioners, a geriatrician, and a pulmonologist\u2014or by the primary service alone. Care by the DMT extended to 2 months after hospital discharge. Unfortunately, neither mortality, need for rehospitalization, nor time to rehospitalization was significantly improved in the DMT care group. This emphasizes the recalcitrance and intractability of the medical problems experienced by this patient population. Similarly, for the patients that compose our study population, at first, care was directed by the original admitting service, with weaning directed by the Critical Service as a consult service. In 2010, we created the SACU, which consolidated all patients requiring mechanical ventilation outside of an ICU to one floor with dedicated ventilator rooms, including monitoring, and a cadre of nurse practitioners who were physically present on the floor 24\u20137. All mechanically ventilated patients were transferred to the General Medicine Service, which coordinated care during daily rounds (7 days a week) with representatives from nursing (both registered nurses and SACU-dedicated nurse practitioners) as well as Pulmonary Medicine, Respiratory Therapy, Rehabilitation Medicine (i.e., Physical and Occupational Therapy), and Social Work Services. The outcomes of patients cared for in the SACU, despite this coordination of care and expenditure of resources, were not significantly different from the outcomes of patients cared for before the creation of the SACU. It is possible that our weaning program was more effective than our data suggest because of other factors that are difficult to account for. For example, during this same time, the Memorial Hospital ICU implemented multiple other care plans directed at improving the likelihood of weaning while in the ICU, including sedation holidays [11] and mobilization while on mechanical ventilatory support [12]. It is likely that these programs led to earlier successful weaning of more patients while they were admitted to the ICU and that the remaining patients, who were discharged from the ICU to SACU care while on mechanical ventilation, represented a sicker patient population with more recalcitrant medical conditions.",

It is our hope that this information can be provided to patients and their families to assist in clinical decision-making. Specifically, with the goal of guiding care in mind, we examined whether an inflection point for success in weaning associated with the duration of weaning might be found. For example, an early period characterized by a high success rate in weaning might be followed by a plateau in weaning success, such that transition to a care plan for long-term ventilatory support could be made. No such inflection point seems apparent, and if it does exist, it seems likely to occur between 45 and 60 days (Fig. 2).",

Multiple studies have noted diminished quality of life [7, 13\u201315], including persistent significant cognitive deficiencies [13, 16], after care that included prolong mechanical ventilation. In general, these outcomes are not anticipated by patients and their caregivers. Cox et al. [17] found that, at the time of initiation of ventilation, 93% of patients and caregivers expected the patient to be alive at 1 year, 71% expected good functional status, and 83% expected a good quality of life. After a year, only 56% of patients were alive, and of these survivors only 9% had a good functional status and 33% had a good quality of life. Taken together, these findings suggest that palliative care teams should be included in the overall management of patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation [18].",
