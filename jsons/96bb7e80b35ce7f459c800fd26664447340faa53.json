            "text": "Bioinformatics is the study of how information is represented and analyzed in biological systems, especially information derived at the molecular level. Whereas clinical informatics deals with the management of information related to the delivery of health care, bioinformatics focuses on the management of information related to the underlying basic biological sciences. As such, the two disciplines are closely related-more so than generally appreciated (see Chap. 1 ). Bioinformatics and clinical informatics share a concentration on systems that are inherently uncertain, diffi cult to measure, and the result of complicated interactions among multiple complex components. Both deal with living systems that generally lack straight edges and right angles. Although reductionist approaches to studying these systems can provide valuable lessons, it is often necessary to analyze those systems using integrative models that are not based solely on fi rst principles. Nonetheless, the two disciplines approach the patient from opposite directions. Whereas applications within clinical informatics usually are concerned with the social systems of medicine, the cognitive processes of medicine, and the technologies required to understand human physiology, bioinformatics is concerned with understanding how basic biological systems conspire to create molecules, organelles, living cells, organs, and entire organisms. Remarkably, however, the two disciplines share signifi cant methodological elements, so an understanding of the issues in bioinformatics can be valuable for the student of clinical informatics and vice versa. The discipline of bioinformatics continues to be in a period of rapid growth, because the needs for information storage, retrieval, and analysis in biology-particularly in molecular biology and genomics -have increased dramatically over the past decade. History has shown that scientifi c developments within the basic sciences tend to have a delayed effect on clinical care and there is typically a lag of a decade before the infl uence of basic research on clinical medicine is realized. The types of information being gathered by biologists today will drastically alter the types of information and technologies available to the health care workers of tomorrow.",

The most dominant new type of information is the sequence information produced by genetic studies. This was enabled by the Human Genome Project , an international undertaking intended to determine the complete sequence of human DNA as it is encoded in each of the 23 human chromosomes. The fi rst draft of the sequence was published in 2001 (Lander et al. 2001 ) and a fi nal version was announced in 2003 coincident with the 50th anniversary of the solving of the Watson and Crick structure of the DNA double helix. The sequence continues to be revised and refi ned and efforts are underway to sequence the genomes of many different individuals (1,000 Genomes Consortium, 2010) . Essentially, the entire set of genetically driven events from conception through embryonic development, childhood, adulthood, and aging are encoded by the DNA blueprints within most human cells. Given a complete knowledge of these DNA sequences, we are in a position to understand these processes at a fundamental level and to consider the possible use of DNA sequences for diagnosing and treating disease.",

It is already clear, however, that some major changes to medicine will have to be accommodated. 1. Genetic sequence information in the medical record . With the fi rst set of human genomes now available and prices for gene sequencing rapidly decreasing, it is now cost-effective to consider sequencing every patient genome or at least genotyping key sections of the genomes. The sequence of a gene involved in disease may provide the critical information that we need to select appropriate treatments. For example, the set of genes that produces essential hypertension may be understood at a level suffi cient to allow us to target antihypertensive medications based on the precise confi guration of these genes. Clinical trials now use information about genetic sequence to defi ne precisely the population of patients who would benefi t from a new therapeutic agent. Finally, clinicians may learn the sequences of infectious agents (such as of the Escherichia coli strain that causes recurrent urinary tract infections) and store them in a patient's record to record the precise pathogenicity and drug susceptibility observed during an episode of illness. In any case, it is likely that genetic information will need to be included in the medical record and will introduce special problems (see also Chap. 2 and Masys et al. 2012 ) . Raw sequence information, whether from the patient or the pathogen, is meaningless without context and thus is not well suited to a printed medical record.",

As there are for laboratory tests, there may be a set of nondisease (or normal) values to use as comparisons, and there may be diffi culties in interpreting abnormal values. Fortunately, most of the human genome is shared and identical among individuals; less than 1 % of the genome seems to be unique to individuals. Nonetheless, the effects of sequence information on clinical databases will be signifi cant. As an example, Kaiser Permanente and UCSF recently completed identifying genome wide genetic variants in 100,000 individuals linked to their electronic health records. 1 The EMERGE research network is specifi cally focused on genetic discovery and replication using electronic medical records and genetics (McCarty et al. 2011 ). 2. New diagnostic and prognostic information sources . One of the main contributions of the genome-sequencing projects (and of the associated biological innovations) is that we are likely to have unprecedented access to new diagnostic and prognostic tools. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and other genetic markers are used to identify how a patient's genome differs from the draft genome. Diagnostically, the genetic markers from a patient with an autoimmune disease, or of an infectious pathogen within a patient, will be highly specifi c and sensitive indicators of the subtype of disease and of that subtype's probable responsiveness to different therapeutic agents. For example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus was determined to be a corona virus using a gene expression array containing the genetic information from several common pathogenic viruses. 2 In general, diagnostic tools based on the gene sequences within a patient are likely to increase greatly the number and variety of tests available to the physician. Physicians will not be able to manage these tests without signifi cant computational assistance. Moreover, genetic information will be available to provide more accurate prognostic information to patients. What is the standard course for this disease? How does it respond to these medications? Over time, we will be able to answer these questions with increasing precision, and will develop computational systems to manage this information. Several genotype -based databases have been developed to identify markers that are associated with specifi c phenotypes and identify how genotype affects a patient's response to therapeutics. The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) annotates mutations with disease phenotype. 3 This resource has become invaluable for genetic counselors, basic researchers, and clinicians. Additionally, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) collects genetic information that is known to affect a patient's response to a drug (more on PharmGKB is described in Translational Bioinformatics, Chap. 25 ). 4 As these data sets, and others like them, continue to improve, the fi rst clinical benefi ts from the genome projects will be realized. 3. Ethical considerations . One of the critical questions facing the genome-sequencing projects is \"Can genetic information be misused?\"",

With knowledge of a complete genome for an individual, it may be possible in the future to predict the types of disease for which that individual is at risk years before the disease actually develops. If this information fell into the hands of unscrupulous employers or insurance companies, the individual might be denied employment or coverage due to the likelihood of future disease, however distant. There is even debate about whether such information should be released to a patient even if it could be kept confi dential. Should a patient be informed that he or she is likely to get a disease for which there is no treatment? What about that patient's relatives, who share genetic information with the patient? This is a matter of intense debate, and such questions have signifi cant implications for what information is collected and for how and to whom that information is disclosed (Durfy 1993 ; see Chap. 10 ). Passage of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in 2008 set initial federal guidelines on use of genetic information. 5 Additionally, the Personal Genome Project (PGP) has been working to defi ne open consent models for releasing genetic information. 6",

DNA is a long polymer chemical made of four basic subunits. The sequence in which these subunits occur in the polymer distinguishes one DNA molecule from another, and the sequence of DNA subunits in turn directs a cell's production of proteins and all other basic cellular processes. Understanding the basic building blocks of life requires understanding the function of genomic sequences, genes, and proteins. When are genes expressed? Once genes are transcribed and translated into proteins, into what cellular compartment are the proteins directed? How do the proteins function once there? Do the proteins need to be modifi ed in order for them to become active? How are the proteins turned off? Experimentation and bioinformatics have divided the research into several areas, and the largest are: (1) DNA and protein sequence analysis, (2) macromolecular structure-function analysis, (3) gene expression analysis, (4) proteomics, and (5) systems biology.",

The fi rst is the progress in our understanding of how biological molecules are constructed and how they perform their functions. This dates back as far as the 1930s with the invention of electrophoresis, and then in the 1950s with the elucidation of the structure of DNA and the subsequent sequence of discoveries in the relationships among DNA, RNA, and protein structure. The second development has been the parallel increase in the availability of computing power.

The long-term benefi ts will include a greater understanding of the proteins produced from the genome: how the proteins interact with drugs; how they malfunction in disease states; and how they participate in the control of development, aging, and responses to disease. The effects of genomics on biology and medicine cannot be overstated. We now have the ability to measure the activity and function of genes within living cells.

Today, they are required by most investigators, and experimental approaches rely on them as critical elements. This is because advances in research methods such as microarray chips , drug screening robots , Xray crystallography , nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , proteomic mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing experiments have resulted in experiments that generate massive amounts of data. These data pose new problems for basic researchers on how the data are properly stored, analyzed, and disseminated. The volume of data being produced by genomics projects is staggering.

In addition, the neighbors of a sequence element are also critical, and it is important to be able to perform queries such as, \"What sequence elements are seen 20 elements to the left of this element?\" For these reasons, researchers in bioinformatics are developing objectoriented databases (see Chap. 6 ) in which a sequence can be queried in different ways, depending on the needs of the user.",

On the other hand, the threedimensional structure information about the proteins, DNA, and RNAis much more difficult and expensive to obtain, and presents a separate set of analysis challenges. Currently, only about 75,000 three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules are known. 9 These models are incredibly valuable resources, however, because an understanding of structure often yields detailed insights about biological function. As an example, the structure of the ribosome has been determined for several species and contains more atoms than any other structure to date. This structure, because of its size, took two decades to solve, and presents a formidable challenge for functional annotation (Cech 2000 ) . Yet, the functional information for a single structure is dwarfed by the potential for comparative genomics analysis between the structures from several organisms and from varied forms of the functional complex. Since the ribosome is ubiquitously required for all forms of life these types of comparisons are possible. Thus a wealth of infor-mation comes from relatively few structures. To address the problem of limited structure information, the publicly funded structural genomics initiative aims to identify all of the common structural scaffolds found in nature and to increase the number of known structures considerably. In the end, it is the physical interactions between molecules that determine what happens within a cell; thus the more complete the picture, the better the functional understanding. In particular, understanding the physical properties of therapeutic agents is the key to understanding how agents interact with their targets within the cell (or within an invading organism).

The traditional premise is relatively simple; tens of thousands of gene sequences derived from genomic data are fi xed onto a glass slide or fi lter. The sequences for each spot are derived from a single gene sequence and the sequences are attached at only one end, creating a forest of sequences in each spot that are all identical. An experiment is performed where two groups of cells are grown in different conditions, one group is a control group and the other is the experimental group. The control group is grown normally, while the experimental group is grown under experimental conditions. For example, a researcher may be trying to understand how a cell compensates for a lack of sugar. The experimental cells will be grown with limited amounts of sugar. As the sugar depletes, some of the cells are removed at specifi c intervals of time. When the cells are removed, all of the mRNA from the cells is separated and converted back to DNA, using reverse transcriptase (a special enzyme that can create a DNA copy from an RNA template). This leaves a pool of cDNA molecules (DNA derived from mRNA is called complementary DNA or cDNA) that represent the genes that were expressed (turned on) in that group of cells. Using a chemical reaction, a red fl uorescent molecule is attached to the experimental cDNA molecules (the \"red group\") and the cDNA from the control group is attached to green fl uorescent molecules (the \"green group\"). These two samples are pooled together and then washed over the glass slide. The labeled cDNA in the pool sticks or hybridizes to the corresponding gene sequences in the spots on the glass slide. The molecules from the two groups will compete with each other to hybridize to the complementary sequences in the spots with the group that had more of a particular sequence binding more of the molecules stuck to the glass slide. Using a scanning confocal microscope and a laser to fl uoresce the cDNA with their dye molecules, the amount of red and green fl uorescence in each spot can be measured. The ratio of red to green fl uorescence for a spot is a measure of the ratio of the expression of that gene product between the red and green groups. This ratio is a measure of whether a gene is being turned off (downregulated) in the experimental group or whether the gene is being turned on (upregulated). As each glass slide can hold up to 40,000 spots each experiment has the potential of measuring the activity of all the genes in a cell due to some experimental change.",

While is it possible for a researcher to measure the fl uorescence of a spot on the gene expression glass slide, it is entirely impractical to measure the fl uorescence of each of the 40,000 spots on each slide. Additionally, an experiment may be composed of several gene expression slides. Computers become critical for analyzing these data because it is impossible for a researcher to measure and analyze all of those red and green spots. Currently scientists are using gene expression experiments to study how cells from different organisms compensate for environmental changes, how pathogens fi ght antibiotics, and how cells grow uncontrollably (as is found in cancer).

Large proteins, called histones, coordinate the structure of chromosomes and their structure and positions are regulated with protein posttranslational modifi cations to the histones bound to the DNA. These changes have been associated with spontaneous mutations in cancer, complex genetic diseases, and Mendelian inherited genetic diseases. Second, cytosine bases in the DNA can be methylated and this can affect gene expression. DNA methylation patterns can be passed on when DNA is replicated.

A key input for these algorithms is a matrix that encodes the similarity or substitutability of sequence elements: When there is an inexact match between two elements in an alignment of sequences, it specifi es how much \"partial credit\" we should give to the overall alignment based on the similarity of the elements, even though they may not be identical.",

The fi rst release, in 1977, contained 77 structures. The growth of the database is chronicled on the Web: the PDB now has over 75,000 detailed atomic structures and is the primary source of information about the relationship between protein sequence and protein structure. 13 Similarly, as the ability to obtain the sequence of DNA molecules became widespread, the need for a database of these sequences arose. In the mid-1980s, the GENBANK database was formed as a repository of sequence information. Starting with 606 sequences and 680,000 bases in 1982, the GENBANK has grown by much more than 135 million sequences and 125 billion bases. 14 The GENBANK database of DNA sequence information supports the experimental reconstruction of genomes and acts as a focal point for experimental groups. Numerous other databases store the sequences of protein molecules 15 and information about human genetic diseases. 16 Included among the databases that have accelerated the development of bioinformatics is the Medline database of the biomedical literature and its paper-based companion Index Medicus (see Chap. 21 ). 17 Including articles as far back as 1809 and brought online free on the Web in 1997, Medline provides the glue that relates many highlevel biomedical concepts to the low-level molecule, disease, and experimental methods.

These mutations can be replacements of one amino acid with another, deletions of amino acids, or insertions of amino acids. The goal of sequence alignment is to align two sequences so that the evolutionary relationship between the sequences becomes clear. If two sequences are descended from the same ancestor and have not mutated too much, then it is often possible to fi nd corresponding locations in each sequence that play the same role in the evolved proteins. The problem of solving correct biological alignments is diffi cult because it requires knowledge about the evolution of the molecules that we typically do not have.

Nonetheless, the available sequence data are starting to be suffi cient to allow good predictions in a few cases. For example, there is a Web site devoted to the assessment of biological macromolecular structure prediction methods. 18 Recent results suggest that when two protein molecules have a high degree (more than 40 %) of sequence identity and one of the structures is known, a reliable model of the other can be built by analogy. In the case that sequence similarity is less than 25 %, however, performance of these methods is much less reliable. When scientists investigate biological structure, they commonly perform a task analogous to sequence alignment, called structural alignment . Given two sets of three-dimensional coordinates for a set of atoms, what is the best way to superimpose them so that the similarities and differences between the two structures are clear? Such computations are useful for determining whether two structures share a common ancestry and for understanding how the structures' functions have subsequently been refi ned during evolution.

MinRMS generates a 19 http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Research/minrms/ (accessed November 30, 2012) family of alignments, each with different number of residue position matches. This is useful for identifying local regions of similarity in a protein with multiple domains. MinRMS solves two problems. First, it determines which structural superpositions, or alignment, to evaluate. Then, given this superposition, it determines which residues should be considered \"aligned\" or matched. Computationally, this is a very diffi cult problem. MinRMS reduces the search space by limiting superpositions to be the best superposition among four atoms. It then exhaustively determines all potential four-atom matched superpositions and evaluates the alignment. Given this superposition, the number of aligned residues is determined, as any two residues with C-alpha carbons (the central atom in all amino acids) less than a certain threshold apart. The minimum average RMSD for all matched atoms is the overall score for the alignment. In Fig. 24 .2 , an example of such a comparison is shown.",

            "text": "Analysis of gene expression data often begins by clustering the expression data. A typical experiment is represented as a large table, where the rows are the genes on each chip and the columns represent the different experiments, whether they be time points or different experimental conditions. Each row is then a vector of values that represent the results of the experiment with respect to a specifi c gene. Clustering can then be performed to determine which genes are being expressed similarly. Genes that are associated with similar expression profi les are often functionally associated. For example, when a cell is subjected to starvation (fasting), ribosomal genes are often downregulated in anticipation of lower protein production by the cell. It has similarly been shown that genes associated with neoplastic progression could be identifi ed relatively easily with this method, making gene expression experiments a powerful assay in cancer research (see Yan and Gu 2009 , for a review). In order to cluster expression data, a distance metric must be determined to compare a gene's profi le with another gene's profi le. If the vector data are a list of values, Euclidian distance or correlation distances can be used. If the data are more complicated, more sophisticated distance metrics may be employed. These methods fall into two categories: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning methods require some preconceived knowledge of the data at hand (discussed below). Usually, the method begins by selecting profi les that represent the different groups of data, e.g., genes that represent certain pathways, and then the clustering method associates each of the genes with the representative profi le to which they are most similar. Unsupervised methods are more commonly applied because these methods require no knowledge of the data, and can be performed automatically. Two such unsupervised learning methods are the hierarchical and K-means clustering methods. Hierarchical methods build a dendrogram, or a tree, of the genes based on their expression profi les. These methods are agglomerative and work by iteratively joining close neighbors into a cluster. The fi rst step often involves connecting the closest profi les, building an average profi le of the joined profi les, and repeating until the entire tree is built. K-means clustering builds k clusters or groups automatically. The algorithm begins by picking k representative profi les randomly. Then each gene is associated with the representative to which it is closest, as defi ned by the distance met-ric being employed. Then the center of mass of each cluster is determined using all of the member gene's profi les. Depending on the implementation, either the center of mass or the nearest member to it becomes the new representative for that cluster. The algorithm then iterates until the new center of mass and the previous center of mass are within some threshold. The result is k groups of genes that are regulated similarly. One drawback of K-means is that one must chose the value for k. If k is too large, logical \"true\" clusters may be split into pieces and if k is too small, there will be clusters that are merged. One way to determine whether the chosen k is correct is to estimate the average distance from any member profi le to the center of mass. By varying k, it is best to choose the lowest k where this average is minimized for each cluster. Another drawback of K-means is that different initial conditions can give different results, therefore it is often prudent to test the robustness of the results by running multiple runs with different starting confi gurations (Fig. 24.3 ) .",

However this overabundance tends to be a factor of the dimensionality of the data, rather than the number of subjects. This mismatch can lead to challenges for experimental design and statistical analysis. Type 1 error, or the tendency to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis and say that indeed there is statistical signifi cance to a pattern (see Chap. 11 ), is amplifi ed by looking at highdimensional data. This is one aspect of what is known as the \"curse of dimensionality\" (Hastie et al. 2009 ). Consider analysis of gene expression data for 20,000 genes, trying to detect a pattern that can predict outcome. In a sample of, say, 30 subjects-a reasonable number when testing a single hypothesis-by random chance, some number of genes will correlate with outcome. Essentially one is testing not one but 20,000 hypotheses simultaneously. One must therefore correct for multiple hypothesis testing. The Bonferroni method is a common and straightforward approach to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. 22 It entails dividing the threshold p -value one would use, traditionally 0.05, by the number of hypotheses. So, for a test of 20,000 genes, one would require a p -value of 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 to call a gene signifi cant. Typically, analyses using high dimensional data such as gene expression are not suffi ciently powered to pass this stringent test. One would need thousands of samples to be sufficiently powered. Another approach is to use q -value, or false discovery rate (Storey and Tibshirani 2003 ), rather than p -value. This approach relies on empirical permutation to determine the expected number of false positives if indeed the null hypothesis is correct, which enables approximation of the proportion of false positives among all reported positives. Consider again the microarray experiment above in which each array includes 20,000 genes. We want to know whether gene X was differentially expressed in cases versus controls. Choosing a threshold p -value, or false positive rate, of 0.05 means that 1 time in 20 we will erroneously reject the null hypothesis and predict a false positive. If a statistical test returns 2,000 positives, i.e. 2,000 genes appear to be signifi cantly differentially expressed, we expect 1 in 20 of the genes being analyzed (20,000 * (1/20) = 1,000) or approximately half of them to be false positives. A false discovery rate of 0.05, on the other hand, would mean that 5 % of those called positive , in this case 100 out of 2,000, are false positives. Q -value is thus less stringent than p -value, but may be of greater utility in a high-dimensional omics context than a traditional p -value or correction for multiple hypotheses.",

Feature selection entails extracting only a subset of the features at hand, in this case genes. This may be done in a number of ways, based on which genes vary the most, or on which genes seem to best predict the categorization at hand. In contrast, feature extraction creates a new smaller set of features that captures the essence of the original variation. As an example, imagine a plane fl ight from Seattle, WA to Key West, FL. One could use a 3-dimensional vector consisting of latitude and longitude to describe the plane's position at any given point along the way. In this case, one value would describe how far the plane had gone in the north/south direction, and one would indicate how far the plane had gone in the east/west direction. However, if we change the axis along which we are measuring to instead be the direct route along which the plane is fl ying, then we only need 1 dimension to describe where the plane is located. The distance fl own tells us where the plane is located at any given time. This approach of changing the axes is the basis for principle components analysis (PCA), a common method for feature extraction. Instead of going from two dimensions to one, PCA on gene expression data typically goes from tens of thousands of features to just a few. Both for feature selection and feature extraction, it is important to replicate the fi ndings in an independently generated data set in order to be sure the model is not over fi tting the data on which it was trained.",

The MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) consortium established the MIBBI project in 2008 to provide a freely accessible, web-based resource for minimum information standards and to enable owners of those standards to harmonize overlapping elements where applicable. The most wellknown of these standards is MIAME, or Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment, but the MIBBI portal lists over 30 minimum information reporting guidelines (Taylor et al. 2008 ) . These guidelines identify only the types of information that must be included. They do not specify format or semantics. For example, MIAME enumerates six required pieces of information: (1) raw data, (2) processed data, (3) sample annotation, (4) experimental design including, e.g., which raw data fi le relates to which sample, which hybridizations are technical versus biological replicates, (5) array annotation, and (6) lab and data processing protocols. Array annotation could include a fi le that identifi es the sequence of each individual spot on the array, or it could simply name a standard commercial microarray chip for which annotation is readily available from the manufacturer. Either of these methods would be MIAME compliant for the array annotation component in that it would enable someone looking at the data to understand what each spot represents.

In this meeting, a set of principles was agreed upon regarding sharing of human genome sequencing data. These principles came to be known as the Bermuda principles. They stipulated that (1) all sequence assemblies larger than 1 kb should be released as soon as possible, ideally within 24 h; (2) fi nished annotated sequences should be published immediately to public databases; and (3) that all human sequence data generated in large-scale sequencing centers should be made available in the public domain. 26 Increasingly, journals and funders require that researchers deposit all types of research data in publicly available repositories (Fischer and Zigmond 2010 ). In 2009, President Obama announced an Open Government Directive that included plans to make federally funded research data available to the public. 27 This announcement describes the NIH's policy regarding published manuscripts in particular, but also notes that the results of governmentfunded research can take many forms, including data sets. Currently the NIH requires that proposals for funding of over $500,000 include a data sharing plan. 28",

Figure 24 .3 shows the logarithmic growth of data in GENBANK since 1982. Entrez Gene curates some of the many genes within GENBANK and presents the data in a way that is easy for the researcher to use (Fig. 24.4 ). In addition to GENBANK, there are numerous special-purpose DNA databases for which the curators have taken special care to clean, validate, and annotate the data. The work required of such curators indicates the degree to which raw sequence data must be interpreted cautiously. GENBANK can be searched effi ciently with a number of algorithms and is usually the fi rst stop for a scientist with a new sequence who wonders \"Has a sequence like this ever been observed before? If one has, what is known about it?\" There are increasing numbers of stories about scientists using GENBANK to discover unanticipated relationships between DNA sequences, allowing their research programs to leap ahead while taking advantage of information collected on similar sequences.",

The experimental protocols used to determine precise molecular structural coordinates are expensive in time, materials, and human power. Therefore, we have only a small number of structures for all the molecules characterized in the sequence data- Fig. 24.4 The Entrez Gene entry for the digestive enzyme chymotrypsin. Basic information about the original report is provided, as well as some annotations of the key regions in the sequence and the complete sequence of DNA bases (a, g, t, and c) is provided as a link (Courtesy of NCBI) bases. The two main sources of structural information are the Cambridge Structural Database 30 for small molecules (usually less than 100 atoms) and the PDB 31 for macromolecules (see Sect. 24.3.2 ), including proteins and nucleic acids, and combinations of these macromolecules with small molecules (such as drugs, cofactors, 30 http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/products/csd/ (accessed November 30, 2012) 31 http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/ (accessed November 30, 2012) and vitamins). The PDB has approximately 75,000 high-resolution structures, but this number is misleading because many of them are small variants on the same structural architecture. There are approximately 100,000 proteins in humans; therefore many structures remain unsolved (e.g., Burley and Bonanno 2002 ) . In the PDB, each structure is reported with its biological source, reference information, manual annotations of interesting features, and the Cartesian coordinates of each atom within the molecule. Given knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of molecules, the function sometimes becomes clear. For example, the ways in which the medication methotrexate interacts with its biological target have been studied in detail for two decades. Methotrexate is used to treat cancer and rheumatologic diseases, and it is an inhibitor of the protein dihydrofolate reductase, an important molecule for cellular reproduction. The three-dimensional structure of dihydrofolate reductase has been known for many years and has thus allowed detailed studies of the ways in which small molecules, such as methotrexate, interact at an atomic level. As the PDB increases in size, it becomes important to have organizing principles for thinking about biological structure. SCOP 32 provides a classifi cation based on the overall structural features of proteins. It is a useful method for accessing the entries of the PDB.",

Initial studies are promising for identifi cation of the genetic cause of disease using individual or family based sequencing (Lupski et al. 2010 ). Currently, many researchers have chosen to sequence either entire genomes, or exomes , the regions of the genome that are transcribed into mRNA, and therefore the most likely to cause disease. Researchers now know that more than 99 % of the DNA sequences within humans are identical, but the remaining sequences are different and account for our variability in susceptibility to and development of disease states. It is not unreasonable to expect that for particular disease syndromes, the detailed genetic information for individual patients will provide valuable information that will allow us to tailor treatment protocols and perhaps let us make more accurate prognoses.

            "text": "Bioinformatics did solve all of its problems with the sequencing of the human genome. Indeed, if we can identify a set of challenges for the next generations of investigators, then we can more comfortably claim disciplinary status for the fi eld. Fortunately, there is a series of challenges for which the completion of the fi rst human genome sequence is only the beginning.An important opportunity within bioinformatics is the linkage of biological experimental data with the published papers that report them. Electronic publication of the biological literature provides exciting opportunities for making data easily available to scientists. Already, certain types of simple data that are produced in large volumes are expected to be included in manuscripts submitted for publication, including new sequences that are required to be deposited in GENBANK and new structure coordinates that are deposited in the PDB. However, there are many other experimental data sources that are currently diffi cult to provide in a standardized way, either because the data are more intricate than those stored in GENBANK or PDB or they are not produced in a volume suffi cient to fi ll a database devoted entirely to the relevant area. Knowledge base technology can be used, however, to represent multiple types of highly interrelated data. Knowledge bases can be defi ned in many ways (see Chap. 22 ); for our purposes, we can think of them as databases in which (1) the ratio of the number of tables to the number of entries per table is high compared with usual databases, (2) the individual entries (or records) have unique names, and (3) the values of many fi elds for one record in the database are the names of other records, thus creating a highly interlinked network of concepts. The structure of knowledge bases often leads to unique strategies for storage and retrieval of their content. To build a knowledge base for storing information from biological experiments, there are some requirements. First, the set of experiments to be modeled must be defi ned. Second, the key attributes of each experiment that should be recorded in the knowledge base must be specifi ed. Third, the set of legal values for each attribute must be specifi ed, usually by creating a controlled terminology for basic data or by specifying the types of knowledgebased entries that can serve as values within the knowledge base.The development of such schemes necessitates the creation of terminology standards, just as in clinical informatics. There are now many controlled vocabularies (or ontologies) and metadata standards for annotation of genomic or proteomic data. For example, Gene Ontology ( GO ) is an ontology used for annotation of gene function, and arguably the most widely used ontology in basic research. Metadata standards help defi ne information which should be collected and annotated upon various types of datasets. For example, the MIAME standard (Minimum Information About A Microarray Experiment) defi nes metadata one would annotate upon a microarray dataset. Recently, the Biosharing website 36 is providing links to terminologies and standards for a wide range of data types. Furthermore, a great many tools have been developed to help researchers access and analyze this data. For example, the previously mentioned Bioconductor project provides bioinformatic tools in the R language for solving common problems. Other commonly used tools include BioPerl, BioPython and MATLAB. 37",
