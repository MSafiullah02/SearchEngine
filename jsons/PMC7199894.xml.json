In some cases, only a few paragraphs were needed, whereas, in others, a somewhat more in-depth discussion was provided. Because many physicians focus on the tables rather than on the text of guidelines, it was decided that all of the information dealing with the initial empiric treatment regimens should be in tabular format with footnotes (tables 1\u20133). The topics selected for updating have been organized according to the headings used in the August 2000 CAP guidelines published in Clinical Infectious Diseases [2]. The major headings were \u201cEpidemiology,\u201d \u201cDiagnostic Evaluation,\u201d \u201cSpecial Considerations,\u201d \u201cManagement,\u201d \u201cPrevention,\u201d and \u201cPerformance Indicators,\u201d and each section had a number of subentries. Our current topics are either updates of specific subheadings or are new contributions, and the committee's recommendations are given at the beginning of each section. A summary of prior IDSA recommendations presented in 2000 and the updated and new recommendations can be found in table 4. Ratings of the strength of the supporting evidence and the quality of the data are given in parentheses after each recommendation, and the grading system used to categorize them is in table 5.",

Selection of the initial site of treatment, whether home or hospital, continues to be one of the most important clinical decisions made in the treatment of patients with CAP, often determining the selection and route of administration of antibiotic agents, intensity of medical observation, and use of medical resources.

Step 1 involves assessment of any preexisting conditions that compromise the safety of home care, including severe hemodynamic instability, active coexisting conditions that require hospitalization, acute hypoxemia or chronic oxygen dependency, and inability to take oral medications. The second step involves calculation of the pneumonia PSI, with a recommendation for home care for patients in risk classes I, II, or III. A description of how the PSI is derived is shown in Appendix A. The third step involves clinical judgment regarding the overall health of the patient and the suitability for home care. Mitigating factors for step 3 include frail physical condition, severe social or psychiatric problems compromising home care (including a history of substance abuse), and an unstable living situation or homelessness. Clinical judgment should supercede decisions made on the basis of PSI alone.",

Thus, this test is not likely to be useful for distinguishing children with pneumococcal pneumonia from those who are merely colonized, and although the specificity appears to be higher for adults, the colonization status has not been systematically evaluated. Other possible limitations include the possibility of a positive test result for patients with bacteremia due to Streptococcus oralis or Streptococcus mitis, because these pathogens contain a cell-wall polysaccharide antigen similar to that of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the potential for variable interpretation of a weakly positive test result [19].",

Additional precautions are advised for aerosol-generating procedures, which include many procedures routinely performed on patients undergoing ventilatory support, because of the evidence for transmission to health care workers in these settings, despite the routine use of airborne precautions [31]. This additional protection may include higher levels of respirators (N100 filters or powered air-purifying respirators), full-body isolation suits, and an outer disposable layer of equipment that can be discarded to reduce possible fomite spread [32]. Infection-control precautions should be continued for at least the duration of symptoms, and some precautions may be warranted for a longer period because of the possibility of more-prolonged viral shedding.

Inoculation of macaques with the novel coronavirus, but not with human metapneumovirus, produced a severe respiratory illness akin to SARS in humans [35]. The findings of preliminary reports of detection of the SARS coronavirus in civet cats and a number of other species are provocative, and a number of investigators are attempting to confirm the findings. The sequence of the viral genome has been completed, placing the agent in the coronavirus family and either as a distant member of 1 of the 3 previously described antigenic groups or in a fourth antigenic group [36].",

Culture of the SARS coronavirus is considered solid evidence of infection. However, the various generations of RT-PCR assays have had problems, both with false-positive results and with inconsistent detection of viral genome in both the first days of illness and in the convalescent phase [40]. Because antibodies to SARS coronavirus have not been found in the general population, background SARS coronavirus antibodies do not appear to be a substantial concern [33, 34]. However, the current serologic assays (both ELISA and IFA formats) do not reliably detect antibodies until the titers increase substantially after the second week of illness [40]. According to the CDC, suspect or probable cases are considered to be laboratory confirmed if SARS coronavirus is isolated, if antibody to SARS coronavirus is detected, or if 2 different RT-PCR assays performed with different specimen aliquots identify the coronavirus RNA. Because of the possibility of false-negative results of cultures and RT-PCR assays, only the absence of antibody in a serum specimen obtained >28 days after symptom onset is considered by the CDC to be a negative laboratory test result for SARS coronavirus [37, 38].",

Culture on selective media detects all but very rare strains but is technically demanding and requires 3\u20137 days [58, 67]. Testing for Legionella species is appropriate for any patient hospitalized with enigmatic pneumonia; testing is recommended for patients with enigmatic pneumonia sufficiently severe to require hospitalization in an ICU, pneumonia in a compromised host, in the presence of an epidemic, and failure to respond to treatment with a \u03b2-lactam. It should also be emphasized that no laboratory test for legionnaires' disease detects all patients with the disease. In the appropriate clinical and epidemiologic settings, therapy for legionnaires' disease should be given or continued even if the results of Legionella-specific tests are negative [58, 67].",

Azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, or levofloxacin) are recommended for severe disease (gemifloxacin is only available in an oral formulation).

Respiratory tract viruses are common causes of often serious cases of pneumonia, particularly in elderly patients, patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, and patients with comorbidities. One prospective study of 1029 chronically ill adults found respiratory viral infections in 35%\u201348% (depending on age) of those hospitalized for an acute respiratory condition (i.e., pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, exacerbations of asthma, or chronic obstructive lung disease) and that influenza, RSV, or parainfluenza virus accounted for 75% of these viral infections [71]. A review of influenza and RSV for the 1976\u20131977 through 1998\u20131999 seasons suggested that influenza was responsible for an average of 36,155 respiratory- and circulatory-associated deaths per year in the United States. Particularly vulnerable were persons with cardiopulmonary disease and persons aged >65 years, especially the \u201celderly elderly,\u201d defined as persons >85 years of age [72]. RSV was implicated in an average of 11,321 cardiopulmonary deaths per year, with most deaths occurring among elderly persons and persons with chronic cardiac or pulmonary diseases. Other viral causes of respiratory tract infections are parainfluenza virus and, less commonly, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, HSV, VZV, and measles. (SARS is discussed in a separate section in this guideline.) Metapneumovirus is a recently described paramyxovirus, which appears to be a potentially important viral respiratory tract pathogen, causing pneumonia in both children and adults [73, 74].",

Sensitivity is \u223c50%\u201370% in adults [77, 78], so that negative test results do not exclude the diagnosis; these tests have not generally proven to be superior to physician diagnosis based on the presence of fever and typical symptoms in the presence of an epidemic [79], but some rapid tests can distinguish between influenza A and B strains, which may have therapeutic implications. Antigen tests for RSV detection are insensitive (<15%) with use of upper respiratory samples from adults.

            "text": "No prospective controlled studies of antiviral treatment of viral pneumonias involving adults have been reported, but antiviral therapy is warranted for infection with influenza virus, VZV, HSV, and other viruses in selected circumstances. The M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine are active only for influenza A virus, whereas the neuraminidase inhibitors are inhibitory for both influenza A and B viruses [80]. Amantadine appears to be as effective as the other agents for influenza A infections and is less expensive, but it is associated with higher rates of toxicity. All are effective for chemoprophylaxis and early treatment (<2 days) of uncomplicated influenza A, but their relative efficacies have not been directly compared, except in 1 study, which found that inhaled zanamivir (which has not been approved by the FDA for prophylaxis) was more effective than oral rimantadine in protection of nursing home residents during influenza A outbreaks, in part because of emergence of resistance to the M2 inhibitor [81]. Early treatment of influenza in ambulatory adults with inhaled zanamivir or oral oseltamivir may reduce the likelihood of lower respiratory tract complications [82\u201384]. The use of influenza antiviral medications may reduce the likelihood of respiratory tract complications, as reflected by reduced use rates of antibacterial agents in ambulatory patients with influenza. In hospitalized adults with influenza, a minority of whom had radiographically documented pneumonia, no obvious benefit was found in one retrospective study of amantadine treatment [85]. Because such patients often have recoverable virus (median duration, 4 days after hospitalization) after hospitalization, antiviral treatment seems reasonable. Because of its broad influenza spectrum, low risk of resistance emergence, and lack of bronchospasm risk, oseltamivir is an appropriate choice for hospitalized patients. For severely ill persons with influenza viral pneumonia, combined antiviral therapy with an M2 inhibitor and neuraminidase inhibitor deserves consideration, but this approach has not yet been shown to improve clinical outcomes in such a scenario [86].",

Clinical clues to facilitate the distinction of inhalation anthrax from CAP have been reported [94]. Features of this disease included a median incubation period of 4 days (range, 4\u20136 days), nonspecific initial symptoms (fever, gastrointestinal complaints, and cough without coryza) and some highly characteristic epidemiologic clues and laboratory findings (a wide mediastinum on chest radiograph, hyperdense mediastinal nodes on chest CT scan, and bloody pleural effusions). Blood cultures were positive for 8 of 8 untreated patients, usually within 18 h [92, 93]. The mortality rates in this and prior inhalation anthrax cases in the antibiotic era were 45%\u201380% [95]. The most important therapeutic interventions are rapid institution of antibiotic treatment and adequate drainage of pleural effusions. Antibiotic selection should be based on the epidemic strain, which may have an unusual resistance pattern due to genetic modification. Treatment and prophylaxis should be prolonged, because animal studies have shown in vivo persistence of spores [95]. Prophylaxis in the 2001 epidemic consisted of 60\u2013100-day courses of oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin for 10,000 persons with suspected exposure; none subsequently developed anthrax [93]. It should be emphasized that the last case of naturally occurring inhalation anthrax in the United States occurred in 1976, so any case of established or suspected inhalation anthrax should prompt notification of public health authorities [95].",

Its potential as a biological weapon was substantiated by extensive studies performed by the US biological weapons program in the 1960s [97]. The most common form of bioterrorism with F. tularensis after aerosol exposure is \u201ctyphoidal\u201d or \u201cpneumonic\u201d tularemia. Clinical features include an incubation period of 3\u20135 days, nonspecific symptoms (fever, malaise, pleurisy, and nonproductive cough), and a chest radiograph showing pneumonia, often with mediastinal adenopathy. If tularemia is suspected, the organism may be cultured from blood samples, sputum samples, or pharyngeal exudates, but only with difficulty, using media containing cysteine or other sulfhydryl compounds, such as thioglycolate broth or charcoal-yeast agar. This organism represents a hazard to laboratory personnel, and culture should be attempted only in a BL-3 laboratory [98]. There are multiple diagnostic methods, including antigen detection, PCR, EIA, immunoblot assay, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis; these are generally available only in research or public health laboratories. Standard treatment is streptomycin, which is preferred, although gentamicin is more generally available, can be given intravenously, and is an acceptable alternative [99\u2013101]. Tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also alternatives, but treatment failures and relapses are more common with these agents [99]. Ciprofloxacin is not FDA-approved for tularemia, but has been used successfully in animals and people [99, 102]. The usual duration of treatment is 14 days. Compared with inhalation plague or anthrax, tularemia progresses more slowly and has a lower mortality rate. The experience with 1409 cases reported during 1985\u20131992 showed that mortality was 1.4% [99]. There is minimal risk of person-to-person spread, and the recommendation for prophylaxis for exposed persons is ciprofloxacin or doxycycline for 2 weeks.",

Clinical features of infection include high fever, chills, headache, cough, bloody sputum, prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, leukocytosis, and radiographic changes that show bilateral pneumonia. There is rapid progression to septic shock and death. The acutely swollen, tender lymph node or bubo that is characteristic of bubonic plague is unlikely to be present with aerosol dissemination. A review of 390 cases of plague in the United States for 1947\u20131996 showed that only 6 cases (2%) were of the pneumonic form [104]. The diagnosis is established with culture of sputum or blood samples; sputum Gram stain shows typical safety-pin\u2014shaped, bipolar-staining, gram-negative coccobacilli. Growth occurs within 24\u201348 h, but identification often takes up to 6 days; if this diagnosis is suspected, the specimen should be split in half for incubation at 28\u00b0C for one half (for rapid growth) and at 37\u00b0C for the other (for identification of the capsular antigen). Health care workers are at risk of aerosol exposure, so respiratory precautions should be taken until patients have undergone therapy for 48 h. The standard treatment for plague pneumonia is administration of streptomycin or gentamicin in standard doses for 10 days [105]. Doxycycline may be given for treatment or prophylaxis, although resistance has been described elsewhere [106]. Ciprofloxacin appears to be as effective as aminoglycosides in mice with experimental pneumonic plague [107] and may be given for treatment or prophylaxis. Administration of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones for 7 days is the preferred prophylaxis when face-to-face contact has occurred or exposure is suspected.",

A systematic review that included 1 randomized trial and 20 cohort studies showed that, for frail older adults, influenza vaccine had an efficacy (1-OR) of 53% for preventing pneumonia, 50% for preventing hospitalization, and 68% for preventing death [116]. A recent large observational study of adults >65 years found that vaccination against influenza was associated with a reduction in the risk of hospitalization for cardiac disease (19% reduction), cerebrovascular disease (16%\u201323% reduction), and pneumonia or influenza (29\u201332% reduction), as well as a reduction in the risk of death due to all causes (48%\u201350% reduction) [117]. In long-term care facilities, vaccination of health care workers with influenza vaccine is an important preventive health measure. Data from 2 cluster randomized trials have shown benefit [118, 119]. Potter et al. [118] randomized 12 long-term facilities to either the offer of vaccination of health care workers or to no offer of vaccination. Vaccination of health care workers was associated with a reduction in total patient mortality rate, from 17% to 10%. Carman et al. [119] conducted a randomized trial involving 20 geriatric care hospitals in which they compared influenza vaccination of health care workers with no vaccination. Vaccination of health care workers significantly reduced mortality among elderly people who had a stay of >6 months in hospitals where health care workers were vaccinated, compared with hospitals where they were not (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.04\u20130.84; P = .014). Influenza vaccine effectiveness varies among influenza seasons, with effectiveness being higher when the vaccine antigens are more closely matched to the circulating strains.",

Advantages of the new vaccine include the potential to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses and the acceptability of administration using the intranasal rather than intramuscular route. Because it is made from live, attenuated virus, however, care should be taken to avoid administering it to certain persons. Inactivated influenza vaccine (the injected formulation) rather than the intranasally administered, live, attenuated virus vaccine should be given to persons aged <5 years or \u2a7e50 years; persons with asthma; persons with reactive airways disease or other chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems; persons with other underlying medical conditions, including metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, renal dysfunction, and hemoglobinopathies; or persons who have immunodeficiency diseases or who are receiving immunosuppressive therapies; children or adolescents receiving aspirin or other salicylates (because of the association of Reye syndrome with wild-type influenza infection); and pregnant women.

There are 2 principal mechanisms of resistance: (1) an alteration of the macrolide binding site by methylation in the 23S rRNA, encoded by erm(B), and (2) an efflux pump, encoded by mef(A), by which bacteria expel macrolides [141, 142]. The methylase causes high level resistance (MIC of erythromycin, 128 mg/mL), whereas the efflux pump produces lower-level resistance (MIC of erythromycin, 1\u201364 mg/mL) that some experts believe can be overcome by increasing antibiotic concentrations. Rarer mechanisms of (high-level) resistance include alterations of ribosomal proteins L4 or L22 that are adjacent to domain V [143, 144].",

In other words, even those organisms that historically had lower-level resistance have become increasingly resistant to achievable levels of macrolides [139, 146].

Telithromycin also has some affinity for the efflux pump [153\u2013155]. These differences explain why ketolides remain active against pathogens with both erm- and mef-mediated resistance.",

Since publication of the 2000 guidelines, fluoroquinolone agents have been more widely used to treat pneumonia, yet, at the same time, several compounds have been withdrawn because of serious safety concerns, and resistance to this class of drugs has been increasing. Emergence of S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to the fluoroquinolones has been described in Canada, Spain, Hong Kong, eastern and central Europe, and, to a lesser extent, the United States [147, 165\u2013171]. In some countries, resistance has been due to multiple serotypes, whereas, in others, it has resulted predominantly from a single serotype, such as the 23F clone in Hong Kong [165, 167]. Fluoroquinolone resistance in S. pneumoniae is primarily due to mutations in the genes encoding the target topoisomerase enzymes, namely parC, which encodes the A subunit of DNA topoisomerase IV, and/or gyrA, which encodes the A subunit of DNA gyrase. Resistance occurs in a stepwise fashion, with first-step mutations in one target gene (either parC or gyrA) resulting in low-level resistance and second-step mutations in the other target genes (either parC or gyrA) leading to higher levels of resistance. In Canada, Chen et al. [165] found that the prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant pneumococci (MIC, \u2a7e4 \u223cg/mL) increased from 0% in 1993 to 1.7% in 1997\u20131998 (P = .01). In adults, the prevalence increased from 0% in 1993 to 3.7% in 1998. In addition to the increase in the prevalence of pneumococci with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, the degree of resistance also increased. From 1994 to 1998, there was a statistically significant increase in the proportion of isolates with an MIC of ciprofloxacin of \u2a7e32 \u223cg/mL (P = .04). In 2002, the Canadian Bacterial Surveillance Network reported that the prevalence of levofloxacin-resistant pneumococci (MIC, 8 \u223cg/mL) was 4% in sputum isolates recovered from patients >65 years of age [172].",

The PROTEKT study (2000\u20132001), a surveillance study that examined the susceptibility of respiratory pathogens to a variety of antimicrobials, including levofloxacin, reported in vitro susceptibility test results for 10,103 respiratory tract isolates of S. pneumoniae recovered from patients in 154 cities and 44 states [178]. Overall, the study found that 0.8% of isolates were resistant to levofloxacin (MIC, 8 \u223cg/mL); however, the resistance rates varied in some states (from 0% to 4.8%) and cities (from 0% to 22%). This wide divergence in the prevalence of resistance is similar to what occurred with \u03b2-lactam resistance to pneumococci in the 1980s, when overall resistance rates were <2% [179]. Extrapolating from what is known about the emergence and dissemination of resistance to \u03b2-lactams among pneumococci, the fluoroquinolones could possibly suffer the same fate, unless these agents are used appropriately. Local monitoring of susceptibility patterns of important pathogens to fluoroquinolones and, in fact, to all classes of antibiotics is important.",
