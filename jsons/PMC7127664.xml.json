Thus, detailed knowledge on which mosquitoe species are competent hosts for the virus and where and when these mosquitoes are present, as well as, on which the vertebrate hosts are the reservoir and their presence are important. So is the knowledge on the kinetics of infection, viremia and virus shedding, the immune response and last but not least good, reliable, and rapid diagnostic tools. She pointed out that virus circulation in vectors and in animal reservoirs precedes human exposure and infection. During an arbovirus outbreak in humans, clinical signs might only be detected when the peak of an outbreak has already been passed. However, virus circulation in vectors and the animal reservoir will precede human infections (Reusken et al., 2018). Therefore, early detection in vectors and animal reservoir hosts can serve as an early warning system to mitigate economic and human health impact.",

In both cases dead bird surveillance and identification of equine infections was an important for WNV surveillance as an early warning system. Dr. Busquets concluded that arbovirus surveillance provides a realistic picture of the epidemiological situation and allows for monitoring the effectiveness of intervention measures. Surveillance in vectors and in vertebrate hosts enables detection of arbovirus circulation before clinical onset in humans. However, countries need to adapt their surveillance scheme to their epidemiological situation, surveillance objectives and capacities. Effective early warning requires the interaction between multiple disciplines like entomologist, veterinarians, biologists, clinicians, epidemiologists, etc.",

In his presentation he focused on two viral proteins, the transactivator of viral gene expression (Tax) and the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ). HTLV-1 is the causal agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) in adults. It has close relatives in several non-human primates and is an important human pathogen with a global distribution of infection foci and an estimated 10 million people are infected (Sonoda et al., 2011). HTLV-1 is transmitted only through cell-to-cell contact passing the virus from mother to infant through breast milk and from male to female through semen. Therefore, living infected cells are essential for transmission and in order to enhance transmission the virus increases the number of infected cells.",

However, it was not clear if HTLV-1 preferentially infects these cells or if infected precursor cells differentiate into these cells. Analyzing tax expression as a marker for viral replication in STLV-1 infected Japanese macaques as a model for HTLV-1 infection in humans, Matsouka and colleagues showed that elevated tax expression is mainly seen in the bone marrow suggesting de novo infection of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Further, in HAM/TSP patients they detected identical integration sites of HTLV-1 proviruses in neutrophils, monocytes, B cells CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells indicating that these cells are all derived from HTLV-1 infected HSCs in vivo.",

In leukemic cells Tax is expressed only in a minor fraction of the cells and only for a short period of time (Mahgoub et al., 2018). Matsouka then concentrated on the important role of HBZ in HTLV-1 pathogenesis. HBZ is encoded on the antisense strand of the provirus and has a low immunogenicity. In contrast to Tax it is expressed constantly in all ATL cells. HBZ regulates several different pathways in infected cells, enable immune escape, trigger inflammation through the induction of IFNg expression, and enable the infection to overcome immune suppressive effects. HBZ also induces expression of the chemokine receptor CCR4 allowing infiltration of infected T-cells into tissues. Seen that HTLV-1 is transmitted through cell-to-cell contact he suggested that HBZ-induced CCR4 expression enables HTLV-1 infected cells to migrate into breast milk and into semen, thus allowing efficient transmission of the virus between humans.",

The utility of such approaches will very much depend on a switch from the detection of single pathogens to an \u201copen view\u201d surveillance with multiplex assays, broad antibody profiling, metagenomics approaches, and an efficient way of data sharing.",

The great success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV Infection is tempered by the fact that treatment must be maintained for life. Rasmussen reviewed work showing that HIV can remain in a latent state where the immune system or ART cannot eliminate the virus. Rebound viremia occurs when ART is stopped even in individuals with no detectable virus in cells or plasma. An experimental approach to clear latent HIV and thus cure HIV infection has been dubbed \u201cshock and kill.\u201d LRAs are used to activate latent HIV allowing the reactivated cells to be targeted and killed by ART and/or the immune system. Administration of LRAs alone have thus far not demonstrated an effect on the frequency of latently infected cells or the time to virus rebound following interruption of ART (\u201cshock, no kill\u201d). For example, in the DIORR trial (Dolutegravir Intensification Effect On Residual virus Replication on ART) lead by Rasmussen there was no change in levels of HIV DNA or RNA. Negative results where mechanisms for failure are carefully examined are important because they can demonstrate which strategies will not work and provide guidance to strategies that do work. Elimination of latently infected cells (particularly those that are long-lived) may require HIV-specific CD8+ T cell effector functions similar to those of so-called elite controllers of HIV-1 infection. Various strategies to boost anti-HIV immunity currently under development including therapeutic vaccines, toll-like receptor agonists, broadly neutralizing antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, interferon-\u03b1 and interleukin therapy should be investigated. Immune checkpoint blockade could also play a role in developing an HIV cure by re-invigorating exhausted T cells and potentially reversing HIV latency in CD4+ T cells.",

Juana Diez from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in the lovely host city of Barcelona continued the session by exploring how viruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are able to express their genomes at high levels in cells from diverse species. The four bases of the genetic code create 64 codons, of which 61 are translated into 20 amino acids and 3 are stop codons. Synonymous codons differ principally at the third base or wobble position. Different species, including mosquitoes and humans, vary widely in which codons are used for protein translation. Dr. Diaz and her team integrated subcellular fractionation and transcriptome-wide analyses of translation in human cells, to show that CHIKV infection induces a host adaptation to viral codon usage into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the preferred site of CHIKV protein expression. The tRNA modification enzyme methyltransferase 9 (KIAA1456) methylates uridine in the wobble position and enhances speed of translation of certain mRNAs, including CHIKV mRNAs. KIAA1456 mRNA is translationally activated up to 40-fold by CHIKV infection. Overexpression of KIAA1456 increases CHIKV replication and KIAA1456 mRNA silencing decreases replication. These findings demonstrate an unexpected interplay of viruses with the host tRNA epitranscriptome that favors viral protein expression. This mechanism appears to be conserved among viruses that replicate effectively in more than a single host species, which opens the intriguing possibility of future exploitation of a broad-spectrum antiviral target.",

Using crystallography, electron microscopy and biochemistry, it was found that two essential proteins in infection; the nucleoprotein NP and the matrix protein VP40 display different conformations. NP is involved in viral nucleocapsid formation and facilitates viral transcription and replication. To avoid premature self-polymerization and non-productive binding to cellular RNAs, NP is chaperoned by the viral phosphoprotein VP35. NP complexing with the amino-terminal portion of VP35 was delineated at 2.3 \u00c5 resolution and electron microscopy indicated the importance of this binding interaction to control NP polymerization. Structure-directed mutagenesis studies identified conserved critical residues in the NP-VP35 interface which could be targeted by broadly effective antivirals. With regard to the matrix protein VP40, another multi-structural protein, it rearranges into three alternative structures, each with its corresponding function at different stages of the life cycle. How these structural changes are triggered has remained unclear. New data revealed that the binding of the VP40 dimer to specific nucleotide sequences is enough to form the octameric structure/form responsible for regulation of viral RNA replication. These findings provide the molecular basis for the multifunctionality of these proteins and reveal attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Viruses rely on the intracellular host machinery for replication, production of viral proteins and assembly. However, outside cells, viruses share many biophysical properties with nanoparticles. Based on these features, viruses have the capacity to accumulate a host-derived protein corona layer in extracellular environments similar to nanoparticles. To evaluate this possibility and its implications, protein corona layers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in different biological fluids such as human plasma and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid were analyzed using proteomics, electron microscopy, infectivity, and dendritic cell activation assays. It was found that RSV and HSV-1 accumulate rich protein corona layers that are unique for each biological fluid and corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation.

In the literature, the Aedes aegypti-Dengue virus (DENV) combination is the most studied in terms of gene expression. However, there is a general paucity of information on mosquito genes involved in vector competence and immune responses with regard to other important vector-virus interactions. RVFV causes an emerging significant public health zoonotic disease which is commonly transmitted mainly by the Culex and Aedes genus mosquitoes. In her talk, molecular responses of Culex pipiens to RVFV infection were presented, particularly those related to genes implicated in the innate immunity pathways (Toll, IMD, JAK/STAT) and RNAi. A total of 445 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified. The gene expression profiles varied at different days post infection. A total of 445 DEG were found wherein 42 DEG were immune function related. Among these genes, some are involved in innate immunity pathways; Cactus or Defensin-A in the Toll pathway or Piwi4 and Drosha in the RNAi pathway. Specifically, three immune pathways Toll, IMD and RNAi and apoptosis were affected by RVFV infection. Conversely, JAK/STAT pathway seems not to be involved in Culex pipiens response to RVFV. Toll and Imd pathways are suppressed after infectious blood feeding, for example AMP (Defensin-A) was down-regulated. The RNAi pathway was mainly down-regulated in the course of the RVFV infection. All these immune system responses would allow the establishment of the RVFV infection in Culex pipiens mosquitoes. These results form a basis for future in depth studies to better understand the functionality of immune related DEG in relation to vector competence to develop new strategies for vector control programs.",

Such infections in Aedes aegypti allows transmission of yellow fever, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses throughout the mosquito's lifetime. The mechanisms of viral persistence in mosquitoes, which involves the production of virus RNA-derived siRNAs and piRNAs, are not well understood. The RNA interference pathways involve double stranded RNAs that degrade target RNAs and mediate gene regulation. In his studies, siRNA and piRNA product depletion, small RNA sequencing, piRNA product expression profiles, immunoprecipitation, and arbovirus assays were used to dissect the viral and host-cell interactions. It was found that the Piwi-family protein Piwi4 has antiviral activity in Aedes aegypti Aag2 cells and in mosquitoes infected with arboviruses and insect-specific flaviviruses. Although these RNA viruses encode no reverse transcriptase, circular episomal DNA in arbovirus-infected Aedes aegypti cells consisting of hybrid sequences of arbovirus-derived cDNA (vDNA) and retrotransposable elements were found. These episomal DNAs appear to be acquired during reverse-transcription by a discriminatory process of vDNA recombination with retrotransposons. Transcripts from vDNA may serve as precursors for antiviral vpiRNAs. Integrated viral-derived (vDNA) can also be detected in the mosquito genome as endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that are often associated with piRNA clusters in the mosquito genome. EVEs are transcribed to produce piRNAs that associate preferentially with Piwi4. Importantly, EVE-derived piRNAs can inhibit the replication of a cognate virus. These findings suggest that the Aedes aegypti Piwi family of proteins and episomal vDNA, and EVEs provide a means of moderating viral load in mosquito cells and a potential mechanism for transgenerational virus tolerance in the mosquito.",

Mutational analysis further identified four amino-acid residues that have an impact on the ability of prM to induce apoptosis.

Jo (RIZ, TiHo, Hannover, Germany) described a new flavivirus (genus Pestivirus) detected in a toothed whales from the North Sea harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena (Tautz et al., 2015). High-throughput data obtained by using next generation sequencing (NGS) and analyzed using an in-house metagenomics pipeline, followed by de novo assembly and phylogenetic analyses, allowed the identification of a novel pestivirus in two out of three investigated harbor porpoises. The complete genome of 11,880 bp, were reconstructed by de novo assembly of sequence reads, and confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the full-length genome. Alignment of the complete genomes of pestivirus species showed that the newly identified virus is evolutionary closest to porcine LINDA virus and porcine Bungowannah virus with 60% homology at the amino acid level. In situ hybridization showed strong granular staining in the cytoplasm of multiple cell types. Based on the new sequence information RT-PCR screening of samples from more than 100 stranded harbor porpoises, collected from the North Sea indicated that about 9% of these animals were positive for the novel pestivirus. The identification of a novel pestivirus in harbor porpoises suggests that the host spectrum of pestiviruses extends to members of the order Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), which are considered to have evolved from artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates) (Jo et al., 2019).",

This more recent geographic expansion of ASF further increases the threat to the global swine industry (Karger et al., 2019). Dr. Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez presented information on genes involved in immune evasion and those hypothetically involved in attenuation of virulence of the genotype I parental ASFV NH/P68. Based on the information obtained, the research team generated putative live attenuated vaccines (LAV) prototypes by constructing recombinant NH/P68 viruses lacking specific genes and containing markers for DIVA tests (Gallardo et al., 2018). A bottleneck for the production of live attenuated virus vaccines has been the lack of permanent cell lines able to sustain productive virus infection. In the studies presented, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were used to propagate the viruses. The results showed that naturally attenuated ASFV NH/P68 strain induced full protection against both homologous (genotype I) Lisbon 60 (L60) and heterologous (genotype II) Armenia07 virulent strains. The recombinant viruses carrying specific deletions were all fully protective against parental homologous (genotype I) Lisbon 60 (L60) strain but only slightly protective against the heterologous (genotype II) circulating Armenia07 strain. More studies are required to assess the basis for the lack of heterologous protection of the recombinant vaccine strain, which could be related to the cell line used to produce the vaccine (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019).",

Fifty-two healthy adults (65\u201382 years; mean age 72 years), seronegative for hepatitis B (HBV), were recruited and enrolled by the SENIEUR protocol to select a strictly healthy population (Ligthart et al., 1984). These seniors were randomized to receive an alum-adjuvanted recombinant HepB vaccine, either subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection, with the inoculum site guided by Computerized Tomography (CT) imaging. The immunological response, expressed as anti-HBs antibody titers at day 210, demonstrated that volunteers who received their vaccinations IM were over three-times more likely to be responders to the HBV vaccine than volunteers receiving SC vaccinations (54% versus 16%, P = 0.004) (Ikeno D et al., 2010). The low seroconversion rate even in the IM group showed a progressive decline with increasing age of the cohort and was associated with significantly lower IgG2 and IgG1 isotypes suggesting a marked shift in Th1 responses. Moreover, the percentage of seniors that showed T-cell mediated responses was significantly reduced and also lower in intensity compared to young adults (Arnold et al., 2011). This study confirmed that SC inoculation sites markedly impair seroconversion rates probably related to the inoculation in the SC fat. These data show qualitative and quantitative deficits in B and T cell responses to alum adjuvanted protein antigens, even in strictly healthy elderly cohorts (Schillie et al., 2018).",

Clinical research during epidemics is crucial to build an urgent response and, yet, requires thoughtful oversight by research ethics committees to ensure the protection of vulnerable subjects facing health uncertainties. To appropriately address the regulatory aspect should be cultivated in anticipation of epidemics and pandemics, rather than in response to them (Alirol et al., 2017). The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) institutional review board (IRB) response during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola epidemic provided an example of research ethics review under a rapid response model. This IRB provided rapid review of multiple protocols during the epidemic, typically with 24 h or less from submission to approval. Since then, UNMC has been developing a centralized IRB for two national networks, both focused on public health emergency research with a vision of establishing a rapid response resource for these networks (Busta et al., 2017).",

Figuerola highlighted the fundamental contribution of wildlife and environment (including climate change) to emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases, including some examples on mosquito borne flaviviruses like West Nile virus (Rizzoli et al., 2015), as well as, non-infectious diseases. He emphasized the need to further research on how organisms interact and how they interact with their environment as a cornerstone to understand infectious disease dynamics. Osterhaus covered aspects of emerging diseases in wildlife, livestock and companion animals, and the role they play in emerging human infections. Subsequently he highlighted the need to prioritize syndrome surveillance and diagnostic platforms in humans and animals, as well as, the increasing role of novel molecular technologies in pathogen discovery (Kruppa et al., 2018). In addition, he stressed that these priorities must be coupled with platforms offering mathematical modelling capacity, animal models and pathogenesis studies for new infections. Moreover, all these aspects should be accompanied by investment in therapeutics discovery and preventive intervention strategies. He finally emphasized a key point of the One Health concept, which is communication among experts, politicians, stakeholders and society (Reperant et al., 2015). Nieto focused specifically on one of the most devastating zoonoses in human history: influenza. She presented recent results showing that the heart should be considered a new target of influenza A viruses in addition to lung, especially by strains of high pathogenicity. In addition, she discussed the need for novel developments of most effective, ideally universal, influenza vaccines, as well as, more effective antivirals with low escape potential.",

Moreover, we are still in a reactive framework (acting once the disease is present) and should rather move towards a preventive and preparedness strategy, that ideally prevents interspecies transmission of pathogens to occur, and if not successful provide the tools for early detection and intervention strategies.

Interestingly, the concept One Health has been highlighted regularly in the scientific literature (more than 1800 peer-reviewed articles), but only few manuscripts propose methodologies to measure the true impact of the implementation of this concept. Moreover, only few suggested quantitative indicators to follow, but no common methodology proved to be available (Baum et al., 2017).

This virus affects over 250 million people globally and causes 686,000 deaths worldwide per year. HBV persists due to the formation of covalently-closed circular DNA (cccDNA) \u2013 the viral minichromosome \u2013 in the nucleus of hepatocytes, and current nucleoside analogs and interferon therapies have a low rate of cccDNA clearance and require lifelong treatment (Schinazi et al., 2018; Schinazi and Asselah, 2017; Boucle et al., 2016). Dr. Schinazi's group has identified the compound GLP-26, a novel and potentially best-in-class glyoxamide derivative, affecting HBV nucleocapsid formation and replenishment of the cccDNA pool. The drug has an EC50 in the low nM range with a therapeutic index of >10,000. In a humanized mouse model stably engrafted with human hepatocytes and infected with HBV, GLP-26 displayed a major effect on HBeAg secretion and HBsAg in addition to a promising pre-clinical profile. More interestingly, long term combination treatment with Entecavir (ETV) in this model induced a four 10log decrease in viral loads and viral antigens reductions that were sustained for up to 12 weeks after ceasing treatment. Dr. Schinazi also briefly describe the activity of novel norovirus protease inhibitors which were also interestingly effective against certain enteroviruses at nM levels. Enterovirus protease has some similarity with norovirus and coxsackievirus protease.",

As an example, it is indicated that phenotypic screening is still one of the main strategies do identify novel classes of antiviral agents while for other therapeutic areas target-based or fragment-based screening has often become more relevant (Murcko, J., 2018; Brown and Bostrom, 2014). Once a hit with antiviral properties has been identified, its optimization to become a lead is a multiparameter process, that can also be determined by the mechanism of action of the compound. Dr. P\u00e9rez P\u00e9rez\u2019 group's own experience in triazolopyrimidines as inhibitors of CHIKV replication was presented to illustrate how proactive and collaborative efforts among academic groups can lead to the identification and optimization of antivirals exploring a new mechanism of action (Gigante et al., 2014; Delang et al., 2016; Gigante et al., 2017; Gomez SanJuan et al., 2018).",

Step (i) is influenced mainly by random genome variations and quasispecies dynamics, and its description is based on mutant spectrum analyses. Step (ii) is guided by the multifactorial epidemiological fitness and transmission-associated random drift of genomes, and its description is based on phylodynamic approaches (Geoghegan and Holmes, 2018; Domingo and Perales, 2019). How events in step (i) influence events in step (ii) is an open question.

Both mechanisms affect standard inhibitors and mutagenic agents active in lethal mutagenesis (Perales et al., 2019). Intra-host selection of resistant mutants affects treatment efficacy and the choice of rescue treatments. Resistant mutants can acquire epidemiological relevance, therefore affecting step (ii) of virus evolution. Epidemiological dominance of resistant mutants may render ineffective the relevant antiviral agents, a problem with similarities to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Possible approaches to minimize selection of escape mutants inspired in quasispecies dynamics will be suggested.",
