            "text": "\nSclerotium rolfsii is the mycelial stage of the basidiomycete Athelia rolfsii, a worldwide soilborne plant pathogenic fungus that lacks a conidial stage. The host range of S. rolfsii comprises over 500 plant species, mostly dicotyledons, but also some monocotyledons (Harlton et al., 1995; Okabe et al., 1998; Cilliers et al., 2000). The main disease symptoms caused by this pathogen include crown and root rot, stem canker or damping\u2010off. The resulting disease is referred to as southern blight, southern stem rot, or sclerotium root rot (Aycock, 1966; Punja, 1985). S. rolfsii produces abundant coarse, white mycelia on infected host tissues and forms sclerotia (Punja, 1985). The fungus overwinters in soil by means of sclerotia, as well as by mycelia in infected plants or infested plant debris (Punja, 1985). It can form a sexual stage, but this rarely occurs in nature and its role in the life cycle of the fungus is unknown (Nalim et al., 1995).",

            "text": "As a cosmopolitan soilborne plant pathogen, knowledge of its genetic diversity and distribution in infested areas would be useful for the management of sclerotium root rot diseases. Characterization of fungal populations into mycelial compatibility groups (MCGs) has been widely used for indirectly assessing the genetic variability among isolates of fungal plant pathogens (Leslie, 1993). MCGs play an important role both in defining field populations of fungi and facilitating genetic exchange in fungal species. This is particularly relevant for fungi for which sexual reproduction has a minimal impact on the disease cycle (Kohn et al., 1991; Leslie, 1993) because MCGs help to preserve the identity of genetically dissimilar mycelia and restrict the exchange of cytoplasm, genetic material and extrachromosomal elements (Caten, 1972). Mycelial incompatibility results in separate and distinct gene pools, which may differ in ecological, physiological and pathological traits. Mycelial compatibility studies have been used to estimate genetic variability or relatedness within many fungal species of the Basidiomycota such as Sclerotium cepivorum (Earnshaw et al., 2000) and Rhizoctonia solani (Carling et al., 2002; Ciampi et al., 2008), as well as ascomycetes such as Fusarium spp. (Puhalla, 1985; Elias et al., 1993; Chulze et al., 2000; Bayraktar et al., 2010), Cryphonectria spp. (van Heerden & Wingfield, 2001), Verticillium dahliae (Korolev et al., 2000; Collado\u2010Romero et al., 2006) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Kohn et al., 1991).",

These studies suggested that MCGs in S. rolfsii can be associated with either the host source or geographical area of isolates, but also a single MCG can comprise isolates from diverse geographical origins and host sources. The variability of mycelial compatibility among S. rolfsii populations occurring in particular geographic regions or specific crops has also been demonstrated. Studies in Brazil (Almeida et al., 2001), India (Sarma et al., 2002) and South Africa (Cilliers et al., 2002) indicated that a considerable genetic variability existed among S. rolfsii isolates from various hosts and localities without clear correlation between the MCG to which they belonged and their host source or geographic origin (Almeida et al., 2001; Sarma et al., 2002), although a certain relationship between MCGs and host source of isolates was suggested for S. rolfsii populations in South Africa (Cilliers et al., 2002). On the other hand, in peanut, wide variation was reported among isolates within a field in Texas, USA (Nalim et al., 1995) and Japan (Okabe & Matsumoto, 2000), with a single peanut field harbouring up to three (Okabe & Matsumoto, 2000) or five (Nalim et al., 1995) MCGs.",

            "text": "Control of sclerotium root rot diseases is difficult because of the extensive mycelial growth, persistence in soil, genetic variability of populations and wide host range of S. rolfsii. In sugar beet, no resistant cultivars are available and attempts to control the disease with fungicides or biological control agents have been unsuccessful (Lal et al., 1997). However, a degree of resistance to S. rolfsii was found in some cultivars of cowpea (Fery & Dukes, 2002), alfalfa (Pratt & Rowe, 2002), peanut (Branch & Brenneman, 1999), pepper, sweet potato (Dukes et al., 1983) and chickpea (Akram et al., 2008). Reports from California and India indicate that the pathogen inoculum density can be effectively reduced by rotations of sugar beet with crops that are slightly susceptible to S. rolfsii, such as alfalfa, asparagus, barley, corn and wheat (Schneider & Whitney, 1996). This same strategy was also effective with rotations of susceptible carrot with sweet potato or buckwheat (Jenkins & Averre, 1986) and peanut with bahiagrass, corn, cotton (Johnson et al., 1999) or wheat (Minton et al., 1991). Knowledge about the genetic and virulence diversity in local populations of S. rolfsii associated with different crops is a key component for the management of sclerotium root rot diseases, particularly through the use of host resistance and crop rotation in a given region. In addition, knowledge of the host range of S. rolfsii populations present in a given area is essential for recommending suitable crops as an alternative to sugar beet production. Unfortunately, information of that nature is lacking in areas of Mediterranean\u2010type climate. Furthermore, the sugar beet production area in the Mediterranean Basin has steadily decreased in Italy, Portugal and southern Spain during the last few years, being replaced by vegetable crops that can be potentially affected by sclerotium root rot.",

Then, small plugs from the inner colony were transferred to modified Patterson\u2019s medium (MPM) in new plates (90\u2010mm diameter) and incubated for 5 days in the same conditions. This MPM allows improved assessment of mycelial interactions among S. rolfsii isolates (E. Remesal & J. A. Navas\u2010Cort\u00e9s, unpublished results). Mycelial discs from the edges of actively growing MPM colonies of isolates were paired on MPM plates. Three isolates were paired on a 90\u2010mm\u2010diameter plate by placing discs 50 mm apart and incubating at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C in the dark. There were four replicated plates per pairing. All isolates were paired with themselves to ensure self\u2010compatibility. All pairings were repeated twice. Pairings were examined macroscopically after 5 and 10 days of incubation for the presence of an antagonism zone in the region of mycelial contact (Punja & Grogan, 1983) and the presence of a coloured red line in the reaction zone between the colonies (Fig. 1a,b). Mycelial compatibility reactions showed no antagonism and were distinguished by merging colonies with no detectable coloured red line between the interacting colonies (Fig. 1c). MCGs were identified based on data from compatible reactions among tested isolates. Because of the high number of S. rolfsii isolates and difficulty of pairing them in all possible combinations, MCGs were defined first at field plot level, pairing isolates from a plot in all possible combinations. Then, one tester isolate was arbitrarily selected from each of the identified MCGs for further analyses. Representative tester isolates from all the identified MCGs in each field plot were paired in all possible combinations (Nalim et al., 1995).",

To find functional groupings of correlated MCGs or plant species, respectively, an agglomerative clustering based on the Spearman correlation matrix was performed among MCGs and among plant species using the Ward clustering method. For MCGs, the optimum number of clusters was estimated on the basis of the average silhouette width according to the Mantel statistic. Thus, the number of clusters in which the within\u2010group mean intensity of the link of the objects (MCG) to their groups was highest (i.e. with the largest average silhouette width) indicated the optimum cluster number. A new dendrogram was then produced representing the identified groupings of MCGs (Borcard et al., 2011). All calculations for cluster analyses were made using R version 2\u00b713\u00b70 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, http://www.R-project.org/) with the cluster (Maechler et al., 2005) and vegan (Oksanen et al., 2011) packages.",

By 1944, the pathogen had also been reported in C\u00e1ceres province in the Extremadura region of southwest Spain, close to the Portuguese border (Dom\u00ednguez Garc\u00eda\u2010Tejero, 1951). Interestingly, this coincided with when the crop sowing date was brought forward from spring to early winter (Morillo\u2010Velarde et al., 2003), which appears more favourable for disease development (Aycock, 1966; Punja, 1985). In autumn sowings, several important changes were implemented in the husbandry of sugar beet, which included complete mechanization of harvesting using heavy equipment. Thus, movement of equipment across fields, together with transportation of harvested roots from fields to distant processing factories, may have facilitated dispersal of the pathogen in soil particles and could be responsible for the rapid spread of MCGs i and iii through Andalusia (Fig. 2). On the other hand, sugar beet has been extensively grown in Portugal since the late 1990s (FAOSTAT, 2010), and sclerotium root rot was of great concern in the major growing areas of central and southern Portugal in 2003, at which time a disease prevalence of 21% of fields accounted for 16\u00b76% of the cultivated area being affected (M. Paim, Associa\u00e7\u00e3o para Desenvolvimento da Beterraba, Portugal, personal communication). In Chile, sugar beet has been grown since the early 1950s and S. rolfsii was first reported in the central regions affecting diverse crops in 1981 (Esterio & Auger, 1982) and on sugar beet in the Metropolitan region and V region in 1983 (Acu\u00f1a, 1985). Thereafter, the pathogen spread to the southern regions reaching the VIII region in 1999 (R. Paillalef\u2010Monnrad, IANSAGRO, Chile, personal communication). MCG iii was the most prevalent group in the current study, being present in two of four, three of eight and all five locations sampled in Chile, Spain and Portugal, respectively. This suggests that MCG iii may have been spread extensively within and among cultivated areas by cultural practices, vehicle movements, planting material, containers, etc. The existence of S. rolfsii isolates of the same MCG in different distant countries was also reported by Harlton et al. (1995), who identified MCG 8 in the USA (Alabama, California and Maryland) and Pakistan; and MCG 1 in the USA (California, Georgia and North Carolina) and Mexico. Similarly, Kull et al. (2004) reported MCG 8 of S. sclerotiorum in soyabean fields in several states in the USA, on soyabean in Switzerland and on canola in Canada.",

            "text": "The present results are also consistent with those of other authors, suggesting a correlation between MCG and geographical source of isolates, as S. rolfsii isolates originating from the same locality tended to form a distinct MCG (Punja & Grogan, 1983; Harlton et al., 1995; 2000, 2002; Punja & Sun, 2001; Sarma et al., 2002). In fact, three of the 12 MCGs identified (MCGs ii, vi and ix) were found only at two close localities and six were present at a single locality. This was the case of MCG iv, which was identified exclusively in Bari (Italy), MCGs vii, viii, x and xii, which were present in each of four different localities in Chile, and MCG xi, which was identified only in Huelva (Spain) (Fig. 2). In a comparable study, Nalim et al. (1995) found that a rather small number of MCGs existed within single peanut fields in Texas. Localization of unique S. sclerotiorum MCGs was also observed in vegetable\u2010growing regions in New Zealand (Carpenter et al., 1999) and on winter canola in Ontario, Canada (Kohn et al., 1991). Explanations for unique low\u2010frequency MCGs in a sampling area may include recent MCG introductions or random mutation events. The emergence of new genotypes localized in single fields may be an indication of MCGs or clones becoming adapted to specific field microclimates or hosts, and are less likely to be the result of genetic exchange and recombination (Ben\u2010Yephet & Bitton, 1985; Hambleton et al., 2002). The existence of single\u2010member MCGs was also reported with variable frequency in different geographic areas and/or host sources (Punja & Grogan, 1983; Harlton et al., 1995; Nalim et al., 1995; Cilliers et al., 2000; Okabe & Matsumoto, 2000; Almeida et al., 2001; Punja & Sun, 2001; Sarma et al., 2002).",

However, MCGs identified in Chile accounted for half of the 12 MCGs identified in the study, of which five were found only in this country. Moreover, a single location in Chile could contain up to three different MCGs, as occurred in Linares (MCGs viii, ix and xii) and Chill\u00e1n (MCGs iii, ix and x). The existence of considerable genetic variability among S. rolfsii isolates was also reported in Brazil, where 13 compatibility groups were identified using 30 isolates from 14 states and 11 hosts (Almeida et al., 2001).",

            "text": "At field\u2010plot level, a relatively low number of MCGs was found within each of the eight sugar beet fields sampled in the Guadalquivir Valley in southern Spain. In these fields, three, two and one MCGs were identified in one, five and two fields, respectively. MCG i was always present, being unique and predominant in two and four fields, respectively (2, 3). Interestingly, the number of MCGs in a field was not related to the number of S. rolfsii isolates sampled in it. Thus, for a similar sampled area the number of isolates ranged from 28 to 80, the field harbouring three MCGs being represented by 31 isolates. These results do not fully agree with those reported by Nalim et al. (1995), who studied four peanut fields in Texas and found one, three and five MCGs in one, two and one field, respectively. However, none of the MCGs reported by Nalim et al. (1995) were prevalent across fields, as only one MCG was present in two fields, while the others were specific to each field. In contrast, the results of the present study are closer to those of Okabe & Matsumoto (2000) in peanut fields in Japan. These authors analysed seven peanut fields and identified four MCGs, with up to three MCGs occurring in a single field and one MCG being dominant in most of the fields sampled. In similar studies on S. sclerotiorum, Kohn et al. (1991) found much higher variability within two canola fields in Ontario, Canada, where they identified 26 and six MCGs from 30 and 33 isolates, respectively, with two MCGs being predominant in one field, and only one MCG being common to the two fields. Similar results were described for the MCG population structure of S. sclerotiorum on soyabean in Argentina and Illinois (USA) (Kull et al., 2004). The present observations and those of Nalim et al. (1995) and Okabe & Matsumoto (2000) are coherent with a \u2018founder effect\u2019 and may reflect the mode of reproduction of S. rolfsii, which does not produce conidia and spreads by mycelial growth. Whilst S. rolfsii does have a perfect stage, its role in nature is not fully understood. In contrast, sexual reproduction in S. sclerotiorum and a greater selection for specific MCGs in populations of this fungus compared with that in S. rolfsii may account for the smaller number of S. rolfsii MCGs found per field in this study. Thus, in the six sugar beet fields in southern Spain comprising more than one S. rolfsii MCG, the MCGs appeared scattered within distinct disease foci with no discernible spatial pattern. This agrees with reports on S. rolfsii in peanut fields in Texas (Nalim et al., 1995) or S. sclerotiorum on soyabean in Illinois (Kull et al., 2004).",

To some extent, these results agree with those of Flores\u2010Moctezuma et al. (2006) who evaluated the reactions of 12 plant species to a set of 20 non\u2010MCG\u2010typed S. rolfsii isolates collected from different agricultural and ecological areas in Mexico. These authors found that gooseberry, lentil, pumpkin, radish and tomato were susceptible to all tested isolates, whereas the degree of susceptibility of the remaining seven species varied widely with the isolate. In the present study, sugar beet cv. Markus was susceptible, moderately susceptible and resistant to isolates from one, eight and three MCGs, respectively. Similarly, Sharma et al.

            "text": "The results of this study have important implications for the management of sclerotium root rot of sugar beet in Mediterranean\u2010type climates, particularly in relation to crop rotation and choice of appropriate crops for use in infested soils previously cropped to sugar beet. Crop rotations are essential to maintain crop productivity and reduce the build\u2010up of soilborne plant pathogens and diseases, which can devastate crops grown in multiple consecutive years (Cook, 2000). Generally, the degree of control is based on the level of susceptibility or resistance of crops involved and the sequences of cropping. In the present study, monocotyledonous species (wheat and corn) were resistant to all MCGs tested and thus are suitable for rotation with susceptible crops. These results agree with those of Boyle (1967), who indicated a reduction in the incidence of sclerotium root rot in peanut fields following a monocotyledonous crop, as well as with those of Minton et al. (1991), who reported that disease incidence in a wheat\u2013peanut rotation was lower than that in a fallow\u2013peanut rotation. Similarly, disease incidence was the lowest in peanut following 2 years of bahiagrass, intermediate following 2 years of corn or cotton, and highest in continuous peanut (Johnson et al., 1999). Nevertheless, results of this present study suggest that S. rolfsii isolates in any of the identified MCGs were able to cause different levels of plant mortality in at least six of the nine susceptible plant species tested. This, together with the occurrence of up to three different MCGs within a field plot or locality differing in pathogenic and virulence profiles, make it difficult to recommend crop rotation as a sole control measure. It would be of interest to evaluate the risk of occurrence of severe epidemics on a given crop based on the prevalence of a given MCG of the pathogen. This would be of importance for southern Spain and Portugal, where vegetable crops such as carrots, peppers, tomato, etc. are becoming alternative crops for sugar beet as a result of the sugar beet production area being drastically reduced or nearly eliminated, respectively. Consequently, sclerotium root rot diseases can become an important threat for vegetable crop production in these areas, as was recently reported for pepper fields in southern Spain (Remesal et al., 2010).",
