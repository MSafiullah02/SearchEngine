Thus, findings of diminished disease severity and a significant reduction in the viral burden in treated hamsters occurred at serum concentrations of MAb 201 that will be achieved using doses similar to those recommended for some licensed MAbs (5-10 mg/kg). Another challenge in demonstrating effective immunotherapy for SARS-infected animals is that the course and kinetics of infection and disease are abbreviated in all animal models reported to date [21, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , compared with the course of SARS in humans [7] .

Viral replication and severe pathological findings persist in the lower respiratory tract for \u223c7 days, after which time they begin to clear. By 14 days after infection, little to no histopathological evidence of inflammation or disease persists, and virus is rarely detected in the upper respiratory tract [21] . Clinical symptoms are not observed beyond the first week after administration of virus in other animal models that demonstrate clinical signs of illness, including aged BALB/c mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates, and infectious virus can no longer be recovered in respiratory tissues after this time. These observations are in contrast to the relatively prolonged course of infection associated with SARS cases in humans, for which the incubation period for SARS-CoV is 2-10 days. The peak viral load has been reported to occur \u223c7 [29] to 10 [30] days after the onset of illness, with peak severity of interstitial pneumonitis occurring a few days later, at 6-13 days (median, 10.5 days) after the onset of illness [29] . Clinical findings may persist well into the second and third week after infection. In experiment 2, we treated an additional 3 hamsters with 40 mg/kg MAb 201 2 days after SARS-CoV infection, at the time that peak viral titers were observed in the lungs [21] , and the lungs of these animals were harvested for histopathological analysis 5 days after infection. Even at this later point in time, the severity of associated pathological findings was reduced in hamsters treated with MAb 201. These hamsters, similar to those treated 1 day after infection, had mild interstitial pneumonitis and moderately severe consolidation. Taking into account these limited observations in hamsters, as well as the longer period from initial exposure of SARS-CoV to the development of clinical symptoms of SARS in humans, suggests that the window for the initiation of MAb immunotherapy in human populations ex-posed to SARS-CoV may be much longer than that indicated by the 24-h window for postexposure treatment used in these studies involving hamsters. MAb 201 has now been shown to have prophylactic and therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV infections in 2 animal models, and these data provide the basis for phase 1 clinical trials of MAb 201 in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1070, "end": 1074, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1079, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text":
