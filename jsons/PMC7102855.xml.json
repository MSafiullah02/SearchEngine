Many important enteric viruses remain non-culturable to date (e.g. norovirus, hepatitis A); therefore, their susceptibility to disinfection cannot be experimentally tested. Non-culturable virus disinfection kinetics must be either determined with human charge studies or predicted using surrogate viruses that can be cultured in vitro but that differ in composition, structure, and function. A framework that enables the accurate prediction of virus inactivation behavior based on a detailed understanding of the processes involved would assist in the development of effective disinfection strategies.",

            "text": "Scientists have long sought to provide mechanistic descriptions of virus inactivation during drinking water disinfection [1]. In the 1960\u20131980s, researchers employed scintillation spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques to detect modifications in viral genomes and proteins and typically reported one of two conclusions: 1) inactivation is the result of damage to the virus proteins or 2) inactivation is the result of damage to the genome [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Although these early studies investigated the molecular mechanisms as much as technologically possible, more recent research has focused less on elucidating mechanisms and more on comparing inactivation kinetics with various virus strains, disinfectants, and water chemistries [7, 8, 9]. This is despite the fact that recent technological advances have provided improved tools for probing molecular mechanisms. Collectively, the proposed virus inactivation mechanisms by common water disinfectants vary widely and are often contradictory. For example, the inactivation of poliovirus by chlorine has been attributed to RNA degradation [2] and to capsid protein modifications [10]. At this time, the fundamental questions of what modifications do or do not cause inactivation remain elusive.",

A physical/chemical description of inactivation is more feasible today than it was ten years ago thanks to advances in genome sequencing, protein mass spectrometry, and structural virology techniques. We focus the majority of our discussion on the disinfection of waterborne enteric viruses [11], in general, and poliovirus, in particular. Enteric viruses are the most relevant to water treatment and poliovirus has been the focus of numerous disinfection studies over the past several decades [12, 13, 14]. It should be noted that this discussion could be extrapolated to other settings where disinfection is used to mitigate virus transmission, such as food safety or medical equipment sterilization.",

Consequently, established reaction rate constants for amino acid and nucleotide monomers can be summed based on their known abundance within virus particles to provide predictions of the relative reaction rates of genome and protein targets [15]. When this is done for Poliovirus 1 Mahoney, chemical disinfectants such as chlorine and ozone are much more reactive with viral protein material than with genomic material (Figure 1\n). On the contrary, UVC radiation affects the genomic material more than the protein material. Unfortunately, such predictions are inaccurate owing to the influence of protein and genome higher-level organization on reaction rates [16, 17, 18]. For example, when treated with chlorine dioxide, denatured poliovirus genomes degraded at a different rate than native poliovirus genomes [19\u2022]. Reactions that take place in the genome and proteins during disinfection can form byproducts that further react with amino acids and nucleotides [20]; this makes reactivity predictions even more complicated.",

A genome-size based approach to predict the sensitivity of virus strains to UVC has been proposed [21], although others have reported that genome-size does not always correlate with virus susceptibility to UV disinfection [22, 23]. Similar to the genome-size based approach, pyrimidine doublet prevalence in virus genomes was suggested as a framework to predict UVC susceptibility [24\u2022]. Indeed, a plot of the number of potential dimerization sequences in a virus genome versus effective UV dose suggested a correlation. The presence of outlier virus strains, however, indicates that alternative pathways play a role in some UV inactivation mechanisms. Taken together, these discrepancies demonstrate that virus component information (i.e. genome and protein sequences) alone will not allow for an accurate prediction of susceptibility. A prior knowledge of capsid and genome structure should therefore aid in interpreting and predicting virus particle reactivity and in identifying the particle's most susceptible regions.",

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has expanded our knowledge of virus structures even further, as it allows virologists to study virus particles that are difficult to crystallize due to either complex capsid shapes, inadequate purification, or intermediate, metastable structures (e.g. virus binding or cell entry processes [28, 29\u2022]). In fact, recent advances in cryoEM have lead to viral reconstructions at resolutions comparable to those obtained with X-ray crystallography [30, 31\u2022]. In addition to ordered capsid protein visualization, cryoEM studies have demonstrated that some viruses have ordered genomes [32] and have described specific interactions between capsid proteins and packaged genomes [33]. It should be noted that resolved near-atomic structures are not yet available for some important enteric viruses such as hepatitis A and human norovirus, although recombinant norovirus-like particles have been reconstructed [34].",

Indeed, a number of studies on nonviral proteins have used structural data to explain the site-specific reactivity of protein components [16, 17, 37, 38]. At this time, however, only a few reports on virus disinfection have mentioned resolved virus structures in the interpretation of results [10, 39\u2022\u2022, 40\u2022]. A study on adenovirus inactivation with chlorine did employ adenovirus structural data to suggest that damaged Met or His residues near a critical motif may contribute to inactivation [39\u2022\u2022]. In another study, protein mass spectrometry was used to identify specific residues in MS2's capsid proteins as the virus was inactivated by UV254 and singlet oxygen [40\u2022]. Residues on the outside surface of the capsid were modified with 1O2 treatment while residues on the inside surface of the capsid near the viral genome were modified with UV treatment. More research is clearly needed to elucidate the effect of virus structure on the reactivity of virus components.",

This type of approach has great benefits over the traditional method of screening and isolating fortuitously emerged, non-virulent virus strains or neutralizing antibodies. Namely, it enables the rational design of site-specific antivirals and vaccines that target relevant virus structures common to several strains or species. For example, coronavirus strains were long believed to have host receptors that were too diverse and too prone to mutation to be susceptible to a broad-spectrum antiviral. Recently, however, Yang et al. [44\u2022\u2022] used function and structure information of all three genetic coronavirus clusters to determine that the main protease has a highly conserved substrate-recognition pocket. Based on this structural information combined with compositional information of conserved amino acids within this region, a protease inhibitor was designed that successfully prevented virus replication of two coronaviruses. Ultimately, the authors suggest that the knowledge of the conserved structure and biochemistry of the protease will lead to the development of a single, broad spectrum antiviral that targets all coronaviruses. A similar approach to water disinfection will lead to the rational design of novel disinfectants.",

The Brunhilde strain was reported to be twice as resistant to chlorination as the Mahoney strain [45, 46]. This discrepancy in inactivation kinetics is intriguing as the two strains have nearly identical capsid protein sequences (\u223c98%) and have similarly sized genomes. Inactivation of the Mahoney strain by chlorine was attributed to a loss in ability to attach to the host cell [10], however this has not been examined for the Brunhilde strain. CryoEM analysis has provided a three-dimensional structure of the poliovirus particle bound to its host cell receptor, sPvr [47\u2022], and a number of capsid protein residues were implicated in the virus capsid-host cell interaction. Interestingly, six of these implicated residues differ in the Mahoney and Brunhilde strains, including Mahoney VP2 Met140 (Thr in Brunhilde) and His141 (Tyr in Brunhilde) (Figure 2\n). Methionine and histidine side chains readily react with chlorine; threonine and tyrosine sidechains, on the contrary, are much less reactive. It is thus possible that the lack of Met and His residues at the binding site is responsible for the greater resistance of the Brunhilde strain to chlorine disinfection.",
