Through virus isolation, gene detection and the analysis of protein structure in the laboratories, the disease was identified as 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by a new kind of coronavirus. Researchers have found that this new coronavirus belongs to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [[2], [3], [4]]. This novel coronavirus is currently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On February 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was officially named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19). COVID-19 is another serious infectious disease caused by coronavirus after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans [1].",

The mortality rate of patients with cardiovascular disease is much higher than that of patients without comorbidities [8]. Growing evidence suggests that combined cardiovascular disease may increase the severity of coronavirus infection and lead to a poor prognosis [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. At the same time, there is also evidence suggesting that serum levels of cardiac necrosis biomarkers have increased to varying degrees in both mild and severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting different degrees of myocardial damage [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. Moreover, the study found that the markers of myocardial necrosis in severe and deceased COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients, suggesting that cardiac damage may be related to poor prognosis [9,10,12,13]. Existing evidence suggests that COVID-19 is closely related to cardiovascular disease, but the specific interaction between the two is unclear. This paper describes the relationship between coronavirus and cardiovascular diseases through a review of the literature and datasets about SARS, MERS and other diseases caused by the human coronavirus, hoping to provide some assistance for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

All CoVs are enveloped, nonsegmented positive-sense RNA viruses [15]. The most significant feature of CoVs is the club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface of the virion. Therefore, CoV look like a tiny corona, as depicted in studies by cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy, prompting the name coronavirus [[16], [17], [18]]. CoV is a respiratory virus that exists widely in nature. Its natural hosts include humans and other mammals, such as pigs, dogs, cats, mice, and bats [19].",

Patients' respiratory symptoms are mild, similar to those of the common cold [34]. Most clinically significant coronavirus infections occur in children under two years of age, although adults can also be severely infected [35,36]. Mortality is negligible [37]. However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have appeared since 2003, are highly contagious and cause a high incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia [33,[37], [38], [39]]. In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is another human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia [1]. The researchers compared the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan with that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV through genetic testing and found that the gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost identical, with a homology to MERS of approximately 40% and a higher degree of homology to SARS of approximately 70% [40]. The differences between the sequences are mainly in the ORF1a gene and the spike gene, encoding S-protein, which is the key protein for the interaction between coronavirus and host cells [40].",

In the heart, ACE2 is expressed in the endothelium [51] and cardiomyocytes [53]. Increasing evidence suggests that ACE2 enzyme activity has a protective role in cardiovascular disease. The loss of ACE2 can be harmful because it may lead to worsened heart function and the progression of heart and vascular disease [49,54]. Virus-induced ACE2 down regulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heightened angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients [55]. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVID-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. In the lung, ACE2 is expressed in type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, 83% of type II alveolar cells express ACE2 [56]. The combination of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 results in increased expression of ACE2, which can lead to alveolar cell damage, in turn triggering a series of whole-body reactions and even death [48].",

However, the male-to-female ratio of NCP-confirmed cases is 0.99:1 in Wuhan, 1.04:1 in Hubei Province, and 1.06:1 in China [8], meaning that there are few differences in prevalence between men and women.

            "text": "RAAS inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs, are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial inflammation. They can control the level of Ang II in the body, slow down the deterioration of inflammation, and improve patient survival. ACEIs and ARBs can also exert their protective effects by activating the ACE2/angiotensin 1-7/Mas axis, which may lead to increased ACE2 in patients [57,58]. Increased ACE2 expression levels may lead to an increased risk of infection. However, there are no reports indicating that patients using ACEIs/ARBs are more likely to become infected. Whether ACEI / ARB can be widely used in COVID-19 patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease was unclear or even controversial [59]. But recently, Guo et al. reported that although more patients with higher troponin T (TnT) were using ACEI and ARB medications owing to their baseline CVD, their use was not associated with patients\u2019 mortality rate [60]. A research published in Circulation Research by Zhang et al. showed that Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI / ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI / ARB non-users [61]. We can see that in-hospital use of ACEI / ARB was not associated with an increased mortality risk. There is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using ACEI / ARB or switch to other antihypertensive medicine.",

Chen et al. found that patients with combined hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases are more likely to develop ARDS [89]. Another study by Hu et al. showed that the incidence rates of critical conditions and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) among SARS patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were 1.8-fold and 1.9-fold higher than those of patients without underlying disease, suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors for SARS patients to devolve into critical conditions and MODS and eventually lead to death [90] (Table 1).",

Another study by Yu et al. found that cardiovascular complications, including hypotension and tachycardia, are common in SARS patients but are usually self-limiting. Bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy were less common, and arrhythmias were rare [92]. Acute myocardial infarction can also be seen in a few SARS patients [93]. SARS-CoV was reported to be found in 40% (7/18 patients) of heart samples from patients who died of SARS during the Toronto outbreak [76], which might explain the myocardial damage discovered in SARS patients [89]. There are reports indicating that SARS-CoV also attacks small blood vessels throughout the body, causing systemic vasculitis [94] (Table 2). In addition to clinical studies, laboratory studies were performed to look for the pathophysiological mechanism associated with myocardial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV infection [[95], [96], [97], [98], [99]]. It was reported that pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV in mice led to a myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ACE2 expression, which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS [99].",

Another study found that 46.2% of the patients who died had hypertension, suggesting that the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease increased the mortality of MERS [108].

COVID-19 is similar to SARS and MERS and manifests as extensively pathological viral lung inflammation [1]. Although similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has its own characteristics [1,114]. Early cases suggest that COVID-19 may not be as severe as SARS and MERS. However, the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and has a lower fatality [3,9,[115], [116], [117]]. Up to April 27, 2020, the overall mortality of COVID-19 was 6.9% globally [5]. But the fatality rate is different in different regions and times, ranging from 0.7% to 13.5% [5,118].",

Cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after COVID-19 [[128], [129], [130]]. And SARS-CoV-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury [60,128]. According to the study by Li et al., the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury [13]. Serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin I (Hs-TnI) and creatine kinase (CK) increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of COVID-19 [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14],[131], [132], [133], [134]]. However, the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases, approximately 22.2% to 31% [9,12,126,133,134], than in patients with mild cases, approximately 2% to 4% [9,10]. The percentage of heart injury in COVID-19 patients who died, approximately 28% to 89% [12,13,132], was higher than that in those who survived. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were also reported to be increased [13,134,135]. Increased Hs-TnI and proBNP expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of COVID-19 [[133], [134], [135]]. Furthermore, it was found that high Hs-TnI levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased levels of immunity (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8 + T cells), suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response [131,132] (Table 2).",

Six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, accounting for more than 97% of the samples isolated from around the world. And the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters: a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from Western hemisphere (Subtypes II, VI, IX, X and XI) and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from Western and Eastern hemispheres (Subtypes I, III, IV, V, VII, VIII, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XVI) [137]. The researchers believed that the genetic structure determined for the SARS-CoV-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs [137].",

The L type (\u223c70%) is more prevalent than the S type (\u223c30%), but the S type was found to be the ancestral version. The L type is more aggressive and spread more quickly. And it was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan. But the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020 for more severe selective pressure placed by human intervention on the L type [138]. Contrary to the L type, the S-type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to the weaker selective pressure [138].",

However, among the other 73 viruses isolated outside Wuhan, 45 (61.6%) were L type, and 28 (38.4%) were S type [138]. This comparison suggests that the L type was significantly more prevalent in Wuhan than in other places. And recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan [[9], [10], [11],139] or outside Wuhan [134,140,141]have showed that the mortality of COVID-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside Wuhan was lower than that in Wuhan (Table 3\n). Although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of COVID-19 in and outside Wuhan, such as the shortage of medical resources in Wuhan, the role of different SARS-CoV-2 subtypes cannot be ignored. The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 subtypes and the mortality of COVID-19 or the CVD complications need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.",

Chronic low-grade inflammatory disease has been widely recognized as a feature of coronary heart disease, and its occurrence is closely related to inflammation [143]. The occurrence of hypertension is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and the activation of the immune system [144]. IL-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels are higher in patients with hypertension than in patients with normal blood pressure [145].

These may lead to the exacerbation of the original cardiovascular disease, which is related to the death of some patients found in the clinic due to heart failure [88,103,132]. According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission, the first COVID-19 death in Shanghai was in an individual who was 88 years old with a severe history of hypertension and cardiac insufficiency. An analysis of the cause of death suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction.

An increase in heart rate over a long period of time will lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased cardiac output, which may cause ischemia or heart failure [156]. Many diseases with fever symptoms may be complicated by myocarditis, such as spotted fever rickettsioses infection [157], severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [158], drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [159], dengue [[160], [161], [162]], complicated scrub typhus [163], herpes simplex virus infection [164], enteric fever [165].",

Weissinger et al. found that in pigs with a bacterial infection with elevated body temperature, serum CK, lactate dehydrogenase (LD), and gamma-globulin (GG) levels were increased. The administration of antibiotics to these pigs and lowering their body temperature reduced CK and LD levels, but GG levels remained elevated, suggesting that the infection did not decrease. This study indicated that the levels of CK and LD were elevated due to fever caused by infection [167]. K L et al. discovered that a longer duration of fever was related to the occurrence of pericarditis after myocardial infarction [168].

Hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the body's anaerobic digestion. Acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane. As hypoxia continues, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly, leading to a series of cell damage processes, including apoptosis [169]. At the same time, hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions, such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines, leading to further tissue ischemia, and may even cause myocardial infarction [13,170,171].",

            "text": "Previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome [172,173], arrhythmia [174], and exacerbation of heart failure [175], mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque, along with other effects [[176], [177], [178]]. Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 and interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) in SARS patients and experimental animal models infected with SARS-CoV [179,180]. TNF and IL-1 family and IL-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure, and they have obvious negative inotropic effects, which may explain heart failure complications in SARS infection [181]. The acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to SARS infection [30]. There is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by SARS-CoV is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines [95,96]. The nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in SARS-CoV-infected mice. Treatment with drugs that inhibited NF-\u03baB activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both SARS-CoV-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after SARS-CoV infection, indicating that the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after SARS-CoV infection and that NF-\u03baB inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by SARS-CoV and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses [182].",

Health anxiety could be found in coronavirus-infected patients [190]. Generally, everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree, and the associated vigilance to a potential health-related threat can be protective. However, excessive health anxiety can be detrimental [190]. The literature indicates that stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in peripheral glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels [191]. High plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias. The activated SNS alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes, contributing to CVD development.",

Coronavirus-induced myocarditis and its subsequent progression to dilated cardiomyopathy have been described in rabbit models [195]. SARS-CoV was found in heart samples from patients who died of SARS [76]. Pathological findings showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration in patients with SARS-CoV in the heart, with evidence of myocardial damage. MERS-CoV was not detected in the heart tissue, and the heart showed no significant histological changes in MERS patients [111,112]. However, an animal model study clearly stated that MERS-CoV RNA could be seen in cardiac tissue, implying direct cardiac pathology [113].

Multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients using ventilator was still high [[213], [214], [215]]. And it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with COVID-19, which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50% [216]. New guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with COVID-19. We advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator. Simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effective.",

Another clinical trial showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir [221]. These data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients, but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients. And early medication may be better.
