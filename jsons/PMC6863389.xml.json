Immune responses to oral cholera, poliovirus (PV) and rotavirus (RV) vaccines are significantly lower in children from LMICs than those of children from HICs [2]. For example, only 58% of Nicaraguan and 46% of Bangladeshi children respond to oral RV vaccine while the efficacy of the vaccine in Finland is over 98% [3, 4, 5]. The poor immune responsiveness to vaccination characteristic for LMICs is multifactorial and is associated with host-associated (genetics and commensal microbiota), pathogen-associated (genetic diversity) and environmental factors [6, 7, 8,9\u2022\u2022,10,11\u2022] (Figure 1).",

Additionally, breastfeeding is known to modulate vaccine responses in infants via altering the microbiome composition and maternal antibody interference with the development of the active (post-vaccine) immune response [19]. High levels of neutralizing antibodies (Ab) in the breast milk of mothers from LMICs were shown to correlate with lower seroconversion rates in their children, suggestive of maternal Ab interference with the \u2018take\u2019 of oral RV vaccines. However, restriction of breastfeeding did not enhance the IgA immune response to oral RV vaccines in children [20\u2022,21].",

The latter is often accompanied by environmental enteric dysfunction (EED, environmental enteropathy) representing structural and functional disorder of the small intestine that is frequently seen in children from the LMICs or patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, differences in the efficacy of oral RV and PV as well as other vaccines observed in LMICs can result from enteric dysbiosis and EED [1\u2022\u2022,22,23]. In agreement with these observations, celiac disease patients have decreased seroconversion to hepatitis B vaccine [24\u2022]. Also, chronic infections with many viruses including human cytomegalovirus and human immunodeficiency virus induce immune suppression decreasing the effectiveness of many vaccines [25]. However studies on the interactions between the resident virome and host immune function are scarce [26,27]. Collectively, these observations emphasize that \u2018healthy\u2019 gut microbiome is the key element that maintains intestinal homeostasis critical for optimal vaccine performance.",

The introduction of the normal microbiota to the GF mice improved their immune responsiveness following immunization [29\u2022\u2022].

Numerically decreased IgA and IgG Ab responses were also observed in the dysbiotic HMA piglets further emphasizing the suboptimal HRV vaccine performance associated with intestinal dysbiosis. Importantly this study emphasizes that dysbiotic microbiome is the primary factor associated with the decreased immune responses, because unlike in infant donors, EED was not evident in the HMA piglets. Further, these results and our previous data [32] suggest that specific pathological microbial signatures can be maintained after dysbiosis was induced and can even be transferrable to another host, negatively affecting their immunity. The latter indicates that maternal dysbiosis can be transferred to infants and leading to health and developmental setbacks in early life.",

            "text": "Most frequently, diet is the primary factor that defines the diversity and functions of the gut microbiota and epigenetically re-programs the host metabolism [15,37, 38, 39]. While balanced fiber-rich diets maintain a healthy microbiota [15\u2022,37], disturbances in the nutritional status (especially in children) impair immune responses and compromise gut barrier integrity [40]. Specifically, protein deprivation leads to intestinal dysbiosis, epithelial breaches, altered metabolism, EED, and immune deficiencies in malnourished children [41,42], which in turn promotes opportunistic infections [43]. Clinical studies show that childhood malnutrition is associated with lower seroconversion rates of oral vaccines [45,46] and contributes to almost half of all deaths of children under five years old [42]. Therapeutic food interventions have reduced mortality in children with severe acute malnutrition, but persistent immaturity of the gut microbiota and the associated incomplete restoration of healthy growth and metabolism remains a major problem [14\u2022\u2022]. Vaccinated protein-deficient pigs had lower protection rates against human RV diarrhea and significantly increased fecal virus shedding titers compared with their protein-sufficient counterparts, which coincided with suppression of multiple innate and adaptive immune responses [44]. These results confirm the negative effects of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) on immune responses to HRV and on vaccine efficacy, which were exacerbated in the HMA versus GF pigs. In this study, PCM decreased the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroides ratios post-challenge, which coincided with increased abundance of Proteus in the gut, while decreased levels of Turicibacter were observed in spleen and ileum [44]. While Proteus species are mostly associated with pro-inflammatory responses, playing roles in the pathogenesis of many gastrointestinal disorders, including Crohn\u2019s disease [45], the relative abundance of Turicibacter species correlates with adequate immune function in mice [46,47].",

            "text": "Additionally, undernourishment is often associated with specific micronutrient deficiencies and deficiencies in key microbiota-derived metabolites. For example, vitamin A deficiency (VAD) affects millions of children in LMICs [48] and leads to significantly impaired mucosal immunity and oral vaccine efficacy [49,50]. Our studies in neonatal GF pigs demonstrated that the protective efficacy of human monovalent and pentavalent RV vaccines and immunoregulatory responses were compromised by VAD [51,52]. Vitamin A derivative, retinoic acid (RA), is required for activation of gut dendritic cells and for imprinting gut homing receptors (CCR9 and \u03b14\u03b27) on vaccine induced B and T cells [53, 54, 55, 56]. Currently, little direct evidence is available on the interactions between the intestinal commensals and vitamin A\u2014both key regulators of intestinal health. In a recent study, VAD induced substantial alterations of the bacterial community structure and meta-transcriptome [57]. Bacteroides vulgatus was identified as a prominent responder to vitamin A status with increased abundance in VAD [57]. VAD was shown to be associated with altered bile acid metabolism in vivo, suggesting that retinol and bile acid metabolites may interact altering microbial communities in the gut [57]. Additionally, growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota, through its effects on bile acids [58], short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and cholesterol metabolism in the gut lumen, can in turn affect intake and metabolism of all fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin A [59].",

TLRs on epithelial and dendritic cells (that can extend their dendrites through the epithelial layer) come into direct contact with luminal microorganisms [76]. These TLR\u2013microbial interactions induce production of anti-microbial peptides and secretory (polymeric) IgA by epithelial and immune cells, respectively [77,78]. Binding of anti-microbial peptides and IgA to the mucus layer that separates commensal bacteria from the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) constrains the topography, composition, and functions of commensal bacteria, thereby preventing inflammatory reactions [79].",

The nonsecretor homozygous genotype in fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2; occurring due to natural polymorphisms) is associated with resistance to NoV genogroup II and Helicobacter pylori infections that vary with ethnicities [101,102]. Distinct HBGA phenotypes also result in variable binding specificities of innate immune factors such as the galectins [103] or differential profiles of circulating natural Abs [104]. Different HBGAs are also observed in animals, including pigs that express A and H antigens (that share high identity with those of humans), which may facilitate zoonotic and reverse zoonotic infections [105]. Further, certain lactobacilli were shown to bind HBGAs [106,107] while some enteric bacteria [108] produce HBGA-like substances suggesting that such bacteria can directly bind some enteric viruses [108]. Collectively, these data suggest that commensal and pathogenic microorganisms have evolved that exploit human and animal HBGAs as cellular receptors.",

            "text": "As discussed above, live, oral vaccines, including RV and PV vaccines, have historically underperformed in the LMICs. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota are currently being recognized as a leading factor associated with vaccine failures, and their effects are being evaluated in human clinical trials. Supplementation with specific strains of probiotics has been shown to have modulatory effects on intestinal and systemic immune responses in animal models providing the basis for studies with vaccines in humans [72,73,112,113] (Figure 2). However, most clinical studies conducted in children and adults generated results that varied by age, antigen, type of Ab response, and probiotic strain [19]. The mechanisms that influence vaccine performance include direct or indirect immunomodulatory actions of probiotics that have yet to be fully evaluated experimentally. Direct effects include alteration of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns presented to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Indirect effects can be mediated by changes to the gut microbiota and immunoactive microbial metabolites such as SCFA [114]. Probiotics also affect the functions of IECs through modulation of tight junctions, increasing mucin and defensin production, inducing antimicrobial and heat shock protein production, interfering with pathogenic organisms, and modulating signaling pathways and cell survival [115, 116, 117, 118]. Certain probiotic strains have been shown to enhance Ab responses to oral vaccines against RV [35,119, 120, 121], Salmonella [122], PV [123], and Vibrio cholerae [124] in human volunteers, and this effect was observed after a short period (1\u20135 weeks) of probiotic treatment. The positive effect of probiotics on immune responses was also seen in parenterally administered vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and hepatitis B [125, 126, 127] in infants after a six-month period. However, no mechanistic explanations for the observed effects or detailed microbiome analysis were available from these studies.",

To establish causal relationships between the composition of microbiota and responses to oral and parenteral vaccines, additional clinical and experimental studies are needed. Large-scale studies correlating the effects of diets, probiotics, and antibiotics with pre-vaccine microbial diversity and post-vaccine immune responses will identify environment and microbiota-driven effects. Adoptive transfer of the dysbiotic microbiomes to GF animals would define the function and reversibility of the microbiome alterations. While most studies conducted thus far have been limited to general changes in microbial profiles, a detailed analysis of the role of a particular bacterial species or community and their correlation with vaccine responses is lacking. The lack of clearly defined \u2018healthy\u2019 baseline microbiome makes it challenging to identify optimal and suboptimal microbiome composition for viral vaccines. To further improve post-vaccine responses, new adjuvants based on particular microbiota-derived immune-modulating molecules or bioactive micronutrients should be evaluated. The ever-expanding knowledge on how the microbiota is altered by the host and environmental factors and the downstream effects of these alterations need to be considered in the design of future vaccines.",
