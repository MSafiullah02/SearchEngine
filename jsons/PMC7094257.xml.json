            "text": "Invertebrates are hosts to diverse RNA viruses, some of which infect only invertebrates, while others can also infect vertebrates or plants, and some cases both vertebrates and plants (Fig. 1\n). Invertebrate RNA viruses have all possible types of encapsidated genetic material (a positive, negative and ambisense, single stranded RNA genome, or a double stranded RNA genome), marked differences in virion morphology and composition, high variability in genome structures and the mechanisms by which genes are expressed (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4\n). It is likely that currently only a small proportion of the existing diversity of invertebrate RNA viruses has been characterized, because the majority of known invertebrate RNA viruses have been found in a relatively small number of economically important species, such as hematophagous insects that vector human or livestock pathogens, or domesticated invertebrate species, such as prawns and honeybees. Therefore the number of RNA viruses of invertebrates is expected to grow to include a wider variety of species, in particular with the application of novel RNA sequencing technologies (Liu et al., 2011). Such an increase in virus genomic information necessitates a system of virus classification that facilitates the assignment of a novel virus to a taxonomic group or the creation of novel taxa. This article provides a brief overview of the principles of virus systematics and describes the distinctive features of the taxonomic groups, which include both pathogenic and non-pathogenic RNA viruses that replicate in invertebrates.",

            "text": "The universally accepted virus classification system is the responsibility of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The most recent report of this committee was published in 2012 (King et al., 2012), and was modified in an online update in 2014 (http://www.ictvonline.org/) (Adams et al., 2013). This classification is largely based on the viral genome organization (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) and genetic relatedness among viruses, but it also takes into account virion characteristics and biological properties such as host range (King et al., 2012). Central to the ICTV virus classification is the concept of a virus species, which is defined as \u201ca polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche\u201d, i.e., the members of a virus species are collectively defined by a consensus group of properties (van Regenmortel and Mahy, 2004, Carstens, 2012). Importantly, this definition recognizes that within a particular virus species, multiple virus variants may be generated as a result of the high replication error rate of RNA genomes (Lauring and Andino, 2010), in addition to recombination and reassortment events between related variants (Holland and Domingo, 1998), and reflects that RNA viruses often exist as populations of non-identical but closely related variants, known as \u201cquasispecies\u201d (Domingo et al., 2012). In general, a group of virus species that share identical genome organization and high sequence homology form a genus, although the precise definition of a genus can vary between virus families. Similarly, there are no universally accepted species demarcation criteria applicable to all RNA virus species across all genera. Viruses are considered to be a different species if they have a distinct host range, have distinguishable serological characteristics and nucleotide (nt) or amino acid sequence similarity of a chosen gene below a threshold level, which is about 75\u201385% nt identity for the majority of RNA virus genera (King et al., 2012). Higher taxonomic categories are subfamilies, families and orders. Assignment of the lower taxa to a higher taxonomic levels reflects phylogenetic relationships between viruses. For example, grouping of virus families to an order is usually done on the basis of evolutionary relatedness of the genes involved in viral RNA replication, in particular the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Supplementary Table S1). Conversely, groups of viruses which lack significant genetic relatedness and/or have distinct genome organization and genome expression features are not grouped together. Such examples include the family Reoviridae, which is not assigned to an order, and the genus Tenuivirus which is not assigned to a family (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S1). Although the ICTV classification is widely used, it has been only partially adopted by GenBank for the annotation of virus sequences, which usually provide order, family and genus information but does not require use of the ICTV approved virus species names (Benson et al., 2005).",

For example, evolutionary relatedness of the RdRp of the family Nodaviridae and the order Picornavirales (Koonin et al., 2008), is not shown in the current ICTV taxonomy. Another reason why it might not be possible to reconstruct the \u201cevolutionary trees\u201d of RNA viruses is the crucial role of horizontal gene transfer, between viral groups and even between viruses and their hosts, in the emergence of novel virus genomes. Individual genome segments, gene blocks and single genes may have independent evolutionary histories, making virus genomic evolution \u201cnetwork-like\u201d, rather than \u201ctree-like\u201d (Koonin and Dolja, 2012). Therefore, although the ICTV taxonomy can be criticized for the lack of a firm basis in the principles of evolutionary biology (Peterson, 2014), it is probably the best compromise approach to the systematics of viruses as it stands today.",

            "text": "The virus particles enter the animal cell via the endocytic pathway in the case of infections in animal cells and subsequently fuse with a cellular membrane within the acidic environment of the endosome. Both receptor recognition and membrane fusion are mediated by viral transmembrane viral glycoprotein (G). Release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm triggers primary transcription performed by the virion-associated RNA polymerase (L protein), which occurs on the RNA-N protein complex (Albertini et al., 2012). Unlike the majority of rhabdoviruses, the members of the genus Nucleorhabdovirus replicate in the cell nucleus, similar to the family Nyamiviridae (Nyamanini virus), (Herrel et al., 2012). The viral RNA polymerase (L-protein) uses exclusively RNA-N protein complex as its template; no removal of the N protein takes place during transcription and replication of the viral RNA. As the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (the L protein) transcribes the negative genome template in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction, it stutters at the intergenic regions, leading to polyadenylation and mRNA termination, resulting in separate monocistronic capped mRNA for each of the viral genes in the N to L gene order (Fig. 2A). A proportion of RNA polymerase drops off the template at each intergenic region, leading to decreasing quantities of each of the transcripts in the N to L transcription sequence, with the lowest numbers of mRNA molecules produced for the L gene (Lyles and Rupprecht, 2007). After viral protein synthesis, infected cells show development of the inclusion bodies that contain the viral RNA synthesis machinery and become the predominant sites of the viral mRNA synthesis (Albertini et al., 2012). Genome replication includes production of the full-length positive sense copy of genomic RNA and then generation of its negative copies which could be encapsidated. The G protein is translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the N-terminal signal peptide is removed and the G protein is glycosylated in the Golgi apparatus. Formation of the virus particles involves association of the viral nucleocapsids together with M proteins and membrane envelope containing the G protein, the mature particles are budded from the plasma membrane. In the case of nucleorhabdoviruses which replicate in cell nucleus, viral budding occurs from the inner nuclear envelope and mature particles are accumulated in the perinuclear space of infected cells (Jayakar et al., 2004).",

Although most of the Mononegavirales which replicate in invertebrates also infect either plants or vertebrates, there are viruses which solely infect invertebrates, such as Drosophila melanogaster sigmavirus, genus Sigmavirus (Carpenter et al., 2007). This virus is vertically transmitted, both paternally and maternally, relying on its host survival and reproduction. Although it is essential for the virus to minimize its negative impact on the Drosophila host, the infected insects show reduced fitness. This could be connected to reduction of female fertility, egg viability, and possibly increased susceptibility to fungal infections (Longdon et al., 2012). Interestingly, the virus-infected flies become paralysed and die after exposure to a high concentration of CO2, possibly due to the effect of virus replication on the nervous tissues (Longdon et al., 2012).",

Potato yellow dwarf virus particles are acquired by Aceratagallia sp. leafhoppers from plants through feeding, the virus initially invades epithelial cells of midgut by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Then virus infection spreads into the nervous system, trachea and hemolymph, reaching the salivary glands and reproductive tissues. The salivary glands accumulate high levels of virus particles which are released by exocytosis and transmitted to new plant host during feeding. Infections of plants cells occurs through direct injection of the virus particles to the cell cytoplasm and through mechanical damage caused by the insect vector\u2019s stylus (Hogenhout et al., 2003).",

            "text": "This family comprises viruses with spherical or pleomorphic enveloped virions 80\u2013120 nm in diameter, with 5\u201310 nm glycoprotein surface projections (Gn and Gc proteins), and three nucleocapsids. The virions contain viral helical ribonucleoproteins of 2\u20132.5 nm in diameter and 200\u2013300 nm in length, which appear circular due to the base pairing between complementary terminal sequences of the genomic RNA. The virions also include a viral polymerase (L protein), which is essential to initiate virus transcription and the replication cycle in newly-infected cells. The single stranded RNA genome is tripartite and includes large (L), medium (M) and small (S) components with total length from 11 to 19 kb (Fig. 2C). The terminal nucleotides at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of RNA each segment are complementary, resulting in the formation of a \u2018panhandle\u2019 structure acting as the promoter for both the transcription and replication. In all Bunyaviridae the L RNA segment, encodes the viral RdRp, the M segment encodes the glycoproteins Gn and Gc, and the S segments encodes the nucleoprotein (N) (Fig. 2D). The ORFs coding for these proteins are present on the genomic RNA segments in negative polarity. The S genomic RNA segment of the genus Phlebovirus and both S and M genomic RNA segments of Tospovirus (which replicates in arthropods and plants) are ambisense and also encode non-structural proteins in the positive polarity (de Haan et al., 1991, Goldbach and Kuo, 1996). Tospoviruses share high similarity with members of the Tenuivirus genus (type species Rice stripe virus, Fig. 2D), an unassigned genus of viruses, which also replicate in both insects (plant hoppers) and plants. Unlike the Bunyaviridae, the tenuiviruses do not possess an envelope and their virions consist of flexible filamentous nuceocapsids of 3\u201310 nm diameter and up to 700 nm in length (Falk and Tsai, 1998).",

The nucleocapsid enters the cell cytoplasm where all stages of transcription and replication occur. The synthesis of mRNAs (Fig. 2C) (e.g. primary transcription), involves using host mRNA fragments containing the 5\u2032 cap as primers (Fig. 2D) (Garcin et al., 1995). Translation of the L and S segment mRNAs takes place by free ribosomes in the cytoplasm; translation of the M segment mRNAs by the membrane associated ribosomes. The glycoprotein precursor is co-translationally cleaved to produce Gn and Gc (Fig. 2D). Replication includes production of the full-length positive-strand copies of the genomic RNA, which act as templates for genomic RNA synthesis. Particle formation involves accumulation and glycosylation of Gn and Gc in the Golgi and budding into the Golgi membrane-derived vesicles. These vesicles containing enveloped virus particles are trafficked to the cell surface and, following the fusion of the vesicular membranes with the plasma membrane, the virus particles are released (Elliott, 2014).",

The best studied viruses of this order are the Coronaviridae which can cause severe infections in humans (Peiris et al., 2003), although this order also includes viruses that exclusively infect invertebrates, such as the insect-infecting family Mesoniviridae (Lauber et al., 2012) and crustacean-infecting family Roniviridae. These virus families have morphologically different particles. Gill-associated virus (family Roniviridae, genus Okavirus) has enveloped rod-shaped virions 158\u2013184 nm by 42\u201347 nm which bear 11 nm spikes, the envelope encloses tightly coiled tubular nucleocapsid with a diameter of about 25 nm and a 5\u20137 nm helical periodicity (Callinan et al., 2003, Cowley et al., 2004). Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) (family Mesoniviridae, genus Alphamesonivirus, Alphamesonivirus 1), has spherical enveloped virions 60\u201380 nm in diameter (Nga et al., 2011, Zirkel et al., 2013). These viruses have similar genome organization and a set of the conserved protein motifs involved in RNA replication characteristic of the Nidovirales, with large genomes that are encoded by two long overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b which are translated as a single polypeptide as a result of ribosomal \u22121 frameshifting event, i.e., shifting ribosome one nucleotide backward during translation without releasing nascent poplypeptide to contnue translation in different frame (Fig. 3A and B; fs). The OFR1a encodes a 3C-like cysteine protease domain (Fig. 3A and B; 3CLPRO) flanked by hydrophobic regions encoded by ORF1a. The ORF1b encodes (in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order) an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (HEL), 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase domains. It was suggested that the ExoN is involved in controlling RNA replication fidelity, making possible the existence of the extremely large RNA genomes in the viruses of this order (Fig. 3A and B) (Nga et al., 2011). Expression of the 3\u2032 proximal ORFs coding for the nucleocapsid protein and the surface glycoproteins involve synthesis of the subgenomic RNA (sgRNAs) on the negative RNA template (Fig. 3A and B) (Cowley et al., 2002a).",

It is uncertain how ribonucleotides and product RNAs would be exchanged with the cytosol if RNA synthesis occurs inside these double-membrane vesicles. It is possible that the coronavirus replication complex might use a protein channel. Alternatively, RNA synthesis might occur in the convoluted single membrane structures which appear to be the major accumulation sites of the viral replicase subunits and include compartments with open connections to the cytoplasm (den Boon et al., 2010).",

These viruses are classified as members of the order Picornavirales (Le Gall et al., 2008). Invertebrate viruses of this order are assigned to the families Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae, which are found only in arthropods. The family Dicistroviridae includes the genera Aparavirus (type species Acute bee paralysis virus) and Cripavirus (type species Cricket paralysis virus). The family Iflaviridae has a single genus Iflavirus, type species Infectious flacherie virus. The virus belonging to the type species infect the silkworm, Bombyx mori. RNA genome of the members of these families carry the protein covalently linked to the 5\u2032 terminus (Vpg) and poly(A) at the 3\u2032 terminus. They contain an extended ORF encoding, in 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order, a conserved block of the non-structural domains typical for all Picornavirales. This includes a 2C RNA helicase, a chymotrypsin-like 3C protease and 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Fig. 3C and D) (Koonin et al., 1993). The genomes of both Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae also encode a conserved block of three structural proteins with a jelly-roll domain typical of the capsid proteins of icosahedral picornaviruses (Le Gall et al., 2008), and the small structural protein VP4. The major difference between Iflaviridae and Dicistroviridae genomes is in the arrangement of the non-structural and the structural genes. The Iflaviridae genomes contain a single ORF, the 5\u2032 proximal part of which encodes the structural proteins and the 3\u2032 proximal part of which encodes the conserved non-structural proteins (Fig. 3A). The genomes of Dicistroviridae contain two ORFs, the 5\u2032 proximal ORF encodes the non-structural block, and the 3\u2032 proximal encodes the structural proteins (Fig. 3D). The polypeptides encoded by these ORFs are proteolytically processed by the viral chymotrypsin-like 3C protease encoded by the non-structural block. Similar to other Picornavirales members, translation of the ORFs of Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae involve internal ribosome entry signals, IRES, which are present at the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR), and the intragenic region of the Dicistroviridae.\n",

It is likely that replication of Iflaviridae and Dicistroviridae in invertebrate cells is similar to that of the vertebrate-infecting Picornavirales members, including the family Picornaviridae.

These complexes contain proteins derived from the whole of the non-structural region of the polyprotein, including helicase, protease and RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains.

            "text": "Members of the order Picornavirales and other picorna-like viruses infect a range of species in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae include 15 and 14 recognized species, respectively (Supplementary Table S1), and similar numbers of putative species. These species include viruses infecting insects belonging to a wide range variety of insect groups, including Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, as well as Acaria and crustaceans. These viruses could be transmitted vertically and horizontally, and cause different degrees of disease, ranging from asymptomatic to highly pronounced leading to host mortality, usually corresponding to low or high levels of virus in infected individual (Fannon and Ryabov, 2016). For example, Deformed wing virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus (the families Iflaviridae and Dicistroviridae, respectively), significantly affect honeybee health, and have been implicated in the global decline of honeybee colonies, thereby threatening pollination services and food security (Lanzi et al., 2006, Cox-Foster et al., 2007, Vanbergen, 2013). Picorna-like RdRp sequences have been identified in sea water (Culley et al., 2003), and it is likely that some of them originate from viruses infecting marine invertebrates. Indeed, Taura syndrome virus (family Dicistroviridae, genus Aparavirus) has a serious impact on shrimp farming (Mari et al., 2002). Picorna-like RdRp sequences have also been identified in bivalve mollusks (Kingsley et al., 2002). Infections by members of the Picornavirales and other picorna-like viruses may differ in their virulence in infected hosts, ranging from asymptomatic infection in honeybees infected with the Kakugo virus strain of Deformed wing virus (Fujiyuki et al., 2004), to a lethal infection, such as Infectious flacherie virus infection of silkworms (Isawa et al., 1998). Usually severe disease coincides with high levels of virus in the infected individuals. It is possible that the adaptation of the virus to the predominant route of transmission determines the severity of the disease, with vertically transmitted viruses usually causing asymptomatic infection or sublethal disease compared to horizontally transmitted viruses. For example, even related viruses, such as the members of the genus Iflavirus genus, such as Deformed wing virus and Sacbrood virus cause asymptomatic infection or death, respectively, when infected at the larval stage (Ryabov et al., 2016). Moreover, introduction of an efficient horizontal transmission route may result in selection of pathogenic strains in a virus population of low virulence, as observed in the case of Deformed wing virus following introduction of the mite Varroa destructor that can transmit the virus between honeybee hosts (Martin et al., 2012, Ryabov et al., 2014).",

Acidification of the endoome lumen promotes fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane. Subsequently, a fusion pore is formed, and the nucleocapsid is delivered into the cell cytoplasm. Viral replication is initiated after uncoating of the nucleoapsid in the cytoplasm of the cell (van der Schaar et al., 2007). RNA synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm in association with modified cellular membranes via synthesis of full-length negative-strand intermediates (Simmonds et al., 2012). Flaviviridae induce replication-associated membrane structures, observed in the cells infected with Hepatitis C virus, Yellow fever virus and Dengue virus (DENV). These vesicle packets consist of an outer bounding membrane surrounding a series of inner, \u223c90 nm vesicles containing most of the replication proteins, dsRNA and nascent RNA, indicating that these vesicles are the likely sites of genome replication (den Boon et al., 2010). Virion assembly, including acquisition of a glycoprotein-containing lipid envelope, occurs by budding through intra-cellular membranes. Viral particles are transported in cytoplasmic vesicles through the secretory pathway before they are released by exocytosis (Simmonds et al., 2012).",

Members of the genus Alphavirus have spherical enveloped particles of 40 mn in diameter containing capped positive stranded RNA of 11 kb in length. The virions are assembled into icosahedral particles of approximately 70 nm in diameter. The 40 mn particle core consists of 240 copies of the capsid protein (C) surrounding the genomic RNA. The nucleocapsid core is covered by a lipid bilayer containing heterodimers of the two viral glycoproteins, E2 and E1, which form a regular icosahedral surface lattice (Powers et al., 2012). The genomic RNA, which serves as mRNA, encodes conserved non-structural proteins which are involved in RNA replication and are encoded by the 5\u2032 proximal part of the genome in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 order. These proteins are nsP1 N7-methyltransferase (nsP1), superfamily 1 helicase and protease (nsP2), RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsP4). Another distinctive feature of members of the Togaviridae is the expression of the 3\u2032 proximal ORFs, which encode the structural proteins, through subgenomic RNAs (Fig. 3J). The alphavirus subgenomic mRNA is translated into a single polyprotein which is cleaved by both viral and cellular proteases to produce which individual structural proteins. The glycoproteins (E1 and E2) are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum during translation and are translocated to the plasma membrane. Upon generation of sufficient C protein, this protein assembles with the viral RNA to form the viral nucleocapsids which occurs in the cytosol. Budding through the plasma membrane leads to the acquisition of a lipid envelope containing the two membrane glycoproteins (E1, E2) (Powers et al., 2012).",

The structural proteins are expressed through subgenomic RNA in the case of Betatetravirus, or encoded by separate genomic RNA component in the case of bipartite members of the Omegatetravirus genus.",

In vertebrates, alphaviruses cause disease ranging from mild febrile illness to prolonged arthritis to encephalitis (Powers et al., 2012, Suhrbier et al., 2012). Alphaviruses are commonly referred to as \u2018Old World\u2019 and \u2018New World\u2019 viruses, with Old World viruses (such as Chikungunya virus, CHIKV, Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, O\u2019nyong-nyong virus, ONNV, Sindbis virus, SINV, and related viruses) generally associated with rheumatic disease in humans and \u2018New World\u2019 viruses (which include Venezuelan, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses) primarily associated with potentially fatal encephalitic disease (Suhrbier et al., 2012). SINV infects humans and avian hosts and are transmitted by Culex sp. mosquitoes. SINV infects both mosquitoes and mosquito cells. Persistently infected mosquito or Drosophila cells are morphologically not distinguishable from uninfected cells, though they show a reduction in the growth rate compared to uninfected. ONNV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (An. gambiae and An. funestus). No harmful effects of ONNV replication were observed in the insect host. Similarly, CHIKV replication has no negative impact on its Aedes aegypti vector (Atkins, 2013).",

The subfamily Spinareovirinae comprises viruses with large particles with up to 11 nm long protruding spikes at each of 12 icosahedral vertices. In contrast, members of the subfamily Sedoreovirinae have virions with a relatively smooth surface topography. The Reoviridae virion core is transcriptionally active and produces capped mRNAs. The virus core represents a multienzyme complex which is composed of two major proteins (VP3 and VP7 proteins in the case of Bluetongue virus, genus Orbivirus), forming a capsid shell composed of 120 protein subunits. The capsid shell contains 10\u201312 genomic RNA segments packed in liquid crystalline arrays in its interior.

The mechanism of genome assembly and synthesis remains largely uncharacterized. For orthoreoviruses and rotaviruses it was demonstrated that the sets of capped mRNAs and certain NS proteins are incorporated into the precursors of progeny virus particles. These mRNAs are then used as templates for a single round of minus strand synthesis, thereby reforming the dsRNA genome segments of a progeny virus particle. The dsRNA genome segments are usually packaged in exactly equimolar ratios (i.e. one copy of each genome segment per particle). The selection of viral mRNAs for packaging is therefore thought to be highly specific, involving recognition signals on each mRNA species. The dsRNA within assembled particles has been shown, in at least some genera, to be packaged as a series of concentric and highly organized shells, which also have elements of icosahedral symmetry. A distinctive feature of insect-infecting members of the genus Cypovirus (e.g. Bombyx mori cypovirus 1) is that virus particles are embedded in a protein crystal, known as polyhedra which preserves virus infectivity in the environment (Coulibaly et al., 2007).",

The genus Cypovirus comprises the cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses of insects found in over 250 insect species. Cypoviruses have only been isolated from arthropods and do not infect vertebrate cells. The majority of Cypovirus infections produce chronic disease, usually without high larval mortality. A distinctive feature is the incorporation of the virus particles (about 70 nm in diameter) into large (several microns) structures, polyhedra, during the late stages of infection (Attoui et al., 2012, Belloncik and Mori, 1998). Cypoviruses are normally transmitted by ingestion of polyhedra on contaminated food materials. The polyhedra dissolve within the high pH environment of the gut and release occlusion derived virus, which then infect the cells lining the gut. Virus infection in larvae is generally restricted to the columnar epithelial cells of the midgut, although virus replication was also reported in the fat body (Attoui et al., 2012). The production of polyhedra gives the gut a characteristically creamy-white appearance. In infected cells the endoplasmic reticulum is progressively degraded, mitochondria enlarge and the cytoplasm becomes highly vacuolated. In most cases, the nucleus shows few pathological changes. In the later stages of infection, cellular hypertrophy is common and microvillae are reduced or absent. Polyhedra are released by cell lysis into the gut lumen and excreted (Attoui et al., 2012, Belloncik and Mori, 1998).",

            "text": "Invertebrates play major and diverse roles in natural and agricultural ecosystems, both terrestrial and aquatic. A growing body of evidence suggests that viruses, which are widespread in invertebrates, can significantly affect the health and population dynamics of their hosts. Examples of this include the effects of bee viruses on pollination services (Vanbergen, 2013), or shrimp viruses in aquaculture (Walker and Mohan, 2009). In addition, numerous arboviruses are vectored by hematophagous arthropods and transmitted to livestock and humans. Consequently, many of these viruses have major veterinary and medical importance (Weaver and Reisen, 2010). Similarly, crop production is greatly affected by plant viruses transmitted by their insect vectors in a propagative manner (Hogenhout et al., 2008). Knowledge of virus host range, pathogenicity, characteristics of the virions and genomic sequence information is essential for monitoring viruses in nature and developing approaches to control the prevalence of infection or minimize their negative impact.",

These technical developments have resulted in dramatic increases in the abundance of RNA virus-derived genomic sequence information, but have also brought new challenges. Most important among these is the scarcity or complete lack of biologically relevant data, including the host range, pathological impact on hosts(s) and virion characteristics, for the viral sequences produced using high-throughput methods. Also, in silico assembly of relatively short NGS reads from viral populations can be hindered by the quasispecies structure of RNA virus populations (Prosperi et al., 2013), and could impact on the accuracy of the assembled virus sequences. The ICTV has defined standards for virus annotation (Brister et al., 2010), and for establishing new virus species and higher taxonomic groups (King et al., 2012), in an effort to resolve challenges related to the use of NGS. As such, maintaining and further developing the work of the ICTV expert study groups is essential for the virology community worldwide.",
