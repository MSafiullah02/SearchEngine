            "text": "Airway management for COVID-19 patients can be challenging as OSA is a predictor of difficult intubation and difficult bag valve mask (BVM) ventilation.16 Factors such as coexisting obesity can lead to rapid oxyhemoglobin desaturation during rapid sequence induction in an already hypoxemic patient. This can put health care workers in a compromised position as rescue maneuvers such as BVM ventilation, supraglottic airway insertion, or cricothyroidotomy are all high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures. Weaning patients with COVID-19 and coexisting SDB mechanical ventilation may be challenging. OSA patients may be at higher risk of failing extubation due to upper airway obstruction compounded by rostral fluid shifts and sedatives and underlying hypoxemia. The combination of upper airway collapse with high negative intrathoracic pressure can generate shear forces causing secondary lung injury. Thus, this patient population may be at higher risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation. In these cases, tracheostomy may facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation and if adapted to apply NIV through the tracheostomy, it can potentially free up ventilators in resource-limited scenarios. While NIV such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) or high-flow nasal oxygenation may be offered as a bridge to extubation under normal circumstances, weighing the benefits versus the risk of viral transmission via aerosol generation to health care workers warrants careful consideration. Alternatively, prophylactic nasal cannula may be applied at extubation in anticipation of hypoxemia with less risk of aerosolization but ultimately does not overcome airway obstruction.",

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a trial of NIV of no longer than 1 hour to avoid failed recognition of decompensation and delaying intubation.18 A recent study reported >40% rate of NIVs failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and association with increased mortality in patients with ARDS.

            "text": "A major concern regarding NIV is its potential for aerosolizing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) containing droplets and transmission to health care workers. The concern is not limited to confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 as up to 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infections can be asymptomatic or presymptomatic.19 The high-flow rates and mask leak associated with NIV combined with coughing provide conditions conducive for aerosolization. The context for these concerns arose initially during the 2003 SARS pandemic.20 Since then, Hui et al21 conducted a series of studies to measure relative dispersion of exhaled air during several modes of oxygen delivery and NIV.22\u201324 Interestingly, maximum exhaled air dispersion distance on oxygen via nasal cannula at 5 L/min was greatest (100 cm) and similar to BPAP with full facemask at settings of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) 18 cmH2O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) 5 cmH2O (92 cm).21,24 In fact, CPAP at 20 cmH2O via a well-fitting oronasal mask or BPAP via helmet with tight air cushion wasassociated with negligible air dispersion.21,22 The findings are summarized in Table.25 Unfortunately, helmet CPAP is not widely available in most countries and is more expensive than standard facemasks. These studies used smoke as the marker for air dispersion. Smoke particles are smaller in size compared to droplet particles and may, in fact, overestimate the dispersion of viral-borne droplets. However, these models may not replicate coughing or sneezing which further increase air dispersion. Some hospital infection control policies require isolation of patients receiving NIV in negative pressure rooms or other settings conducive to airborne isolation. In the midst of a pandemic, these resources may not be readily available, and therefore, exceptions should be considered to avoid withholding an otherwise beneficial therapy.",

Current guidelines from the Society for Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine (SASM) recommend continued use of CPAP through the perioperative period to prevent postoperative complications.26 It is well established that postoperative OSA patients receiving anesthetics, sedatives, and opioids and even intravenous fluids are at risk of developing postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and are at increased susceptibility if they remain untreated with CPAP/BPAP.27,28 In patients with known or suspected COVID, the feasibility of this practice is threatened by the potential for viral transmission to health care workers. Thus, benefits and infection risk of administering NIV must be carefully considered in context of depleting resources for isolation areas on postanesthetic care units and surgical wards to safely administer NIV.",

            "text": "Given the increased demand and scarcity of resources during a pandemic, it is essential to identify strategies to minimize risk to the patient and health care workers. Clinicians should prepare for cases when OSA patients will not be able to continue CPAP/BPAP and to weigh the clinical benefit versus risk of transmission. For surgical patients, using regional anesthesia techniques whenever possible can avoid high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedures such as airway manipulation and intubation and reduce opioid consumption to minimize postoperative respiratory depression and exacerbation of OSA. For patients at increased risk, that is, moderate\u2013severe OSA receiving opioids, we recommend obtaining a postoperative monitored bed with continuous pulse oximetry, ideally with capnography, to provide early warnings of hypoventilation and/or hypoxemia. Finally, for those who do receive NIV on wards, in addition to following institution-based infection control practices and donning appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the nosocomial spread of COVID-19, we recommend the following precautions:",

In the pre-COVID-19 era, NIV has been a useful therapy in management of patients with OSA. However, the current pandemic raises several issues with their use. Patients with COVID-19 can decompensate quickly and the use of NIV may mask pending decline. NIV also generates aerosol droplets increasing the risk of viral transmission to other patients and health care workers. Thus, careful consideration must be taken to balance the risk profile of the individual, evolving clinical status, and the risk of viral transmission according to the type of NIV, the patient\u2013ventilator interface, and the available precautions.",
