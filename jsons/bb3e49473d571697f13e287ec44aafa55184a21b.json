It is essential to identify the subset of helpful reviews from the large number of reviews of varying quality. This paper aims to build a model to predict review helpfulness automatically. Our work is inspired by the observation that a customer's expectation of a review can be greatly affected by review sentiment and the degree to which the customer is aware of pertinent product information. Consequently, a customer may pay more attention to that specific content of a review which contributes more to its helpfulness from their perspective. To model such customer expectations and capture important information from a review text, we propose a novel neural network which leverages review sentiment and product information. Specifically, we encode the sentiment of a review through an attention module, to get sentiment-driven information from review text. We also introduce a product attention layer that fuses information from both the target product and related products, in order to capture the product related information from review text. Our experimental results show an AUC improvement of 5.4% and 1.5% over the previous state of the art model on Amazon and Yelp data sets, respectively.",

However, such features are extracted from each source independently, without considering interactions. In particular, previous approaches do not take into account the customer review evaluating process. A customer's perception of helpful information of a review is affected by the sentiment of the review and what the customer already knows about the product. Before reading a review text for a product, the customer is very likely to be aware of background information such as star rating, product attributes, etc. When a customer reads a review with a lower star rating, he may hold a negative opinion towards the item at first and mainly look into those aspects of the review supporting the lower star rating. Although review sentiment has been previously explored [7, 15, 17] , previous work has not used review sentiment to identify useful information from review text. Moreover, the customer likely has some preconceptions of the product features they are most interested in. With these expectations in mind, the customer pays special attention to those aspects of the review text that they find most salient. There have been earlier efforts [4, 6, 13] at capturing useful information from a review by considering product information. However, the unique aspects of each product (different levels of importance of attributes, evaluation standard, etc.) were not fully identified in those efforts.",

[1] designed a word-level gating mechanism to represent the relative importance of each word. Fan et al. [3] proposed a multitask paradigm to predict the star ratings of reviews and to identify the helpful reviews more accurately. They also utilized the metadata of the target product in addition to the textual content of a review to better represent a review [4] . The methods summarized above are representative of the research progress in review helpfulness prediction. Sentiment and product information have been explored previously [4, 7, 10, 15] . With respect to sentiment, Martin and Pu [15] extracted emotional words from review text to serve as important parameters for helpfulness prediction. However, previous research has not taken into account differences in customer expectations that can result from review sentiment perception. With respect to product information, Fan et al. [4] tried to better represent the salient information in reviews by considering the metadata information (title, categories) of the target product. However, this information can be quite similar for products of the same type, so the unique aspects of each product (different degrees of importance of attributes, evaluation standard, etc.) can not be fully captured from reviews. Wu et al. [26] presented an architecture similar to the one we propose here. However, the design of the sentiment attention layer and product attention layer in our architecture is different from their attention layers. Moreover, their architecture is intended for classifying review sentiment.",

We then performed a grid search of hyper-parameter space on the validation data set to determine the best choice of hyper-parameters. The models were then trained based on the entire training data set with these fixed hyper-parameters. Tables 3 and 4 show the results on the Amazon data set and Yelp data set, respectively. In Table 3 we see that our model outperforms previous models on all categories of the Amazon data set. The average improvement in AUC is 5.4% over the next best model. We observe that the degree of improvement varies from category to category. In the categories AC3 (Electronics), our model achieves improvement of 7.9%. In contrast, for the category AC4 (Grocery & Gourmet Food), the improvement is only 0.3%. We note that the category AC4, has less data than most of other categories (Table 1) . Only the category AC8 (Pet Supplies) contains fewer products and reviews. However, there are proportionally more reviews per product for the category AC8 than for the category AC4. We suspect that sentiment embedding and product embedding may not be learned well with such limited and divergent data. Therefore the improvement is not as high as that for the other categories. The results for the yelp data set are presented in Table 4 . We find that our model also outperforms the previous models in all categories. The average improvement in AUC is 1.5% over the next best model. We note that the overall improvement is not as high as that demonstrated in the Amazon data set.

HSA refers to the combination of the HBiLSTM with the sentiment attention layer. HPA refers to the combination of the HBiLSTM with the product attention layer. Finally, HSAPA refers to the complete model which implements both attention layers. From Table 5 , we see that adding a sentiment attention layer (HSA) to the base model (HBiLSTM) results in an average improvement in the AUC score of 2.0% and 2.6%, respectively on the Amazon and Yelp data sets. By adding a product attention layer (HPA) to the base model (HBiLSTM), the improvement is 0.7% and 1.3% on the Amazon and Yelp data sets respectively. Combining all three components results in an even larger increase in AUC score, 3.4% and 4.8%, respectively on the Amazon and Yelp data sets. We observe a synergistic effect resulting from the addition of the two attention layers. We also note that in both data sets, the improvement from the product attention layer is lower than that from the sentiment attention layer. This may be due to the fact that in the cold start scenario we have no information about the target product. Possibly the helpful attributes shared by related products may not be sufficiently accurate.",

Not surprisingly, the new models with more parameters do not demonstrate an improvement in performance in comparison to the models with hyper-parameters determined by grid-search. Our proposed model demonstrates improved performance, not simply because of greater modelling power due to more parameters, but because of the leveraging of sentiment and product related information by the sentiment and product attention layers.",

For this scenario, we randomly select 80% of the reviews as the training data, and use the remaining reviews as the test data. The data statistics are essentially the same in scenario 2 as that in scenario 1 (Tables 1 and 2 ). As 80% of the reviews for products are in training data set, this partitioning produces a warm start scenario. We also evaluated the contribution of each attention layer in the warm start scenario. Tables 6 and 7 show that, on average, the addition of the sentiment layer (HSA) to the base model increases the AUC by 1.8% and 2.7% on Yelp and Amazon data sets, respectively. We also find that the addition of the product attention layer (HPA) to the base model increases the AUC by 3.8% and 5.5% on Yelp and Amazon data sets, respectively. Comparing the results from warm start scenario to cold start Scenario, we make the following observations. First, the average performance of the base model (HBiLSTM) is very similar in both scenarios. Second, the AUC improvement from the product attention layer (HPA) is higher than that from the sentiment attention layer (HSA) on both data sets in the warm start scenario. This improvement is not seen in the case of the cold start scenario. In the cold start scenario the product embedding can only be learned from reviews of related products. In contrast, in the warm start scenario product information can be learned from both the target product and related products. This explains why the product attention layer can achieve better performance in warm start compared to cold start scenario. From the performance results described in the cold start scenario section (Tables 3 and 4) , we see that HSAPA out-performs the other models. We also see that HSAPA has even better performance in the warm start scenario (Tables 6 and 7 ). In practice, one can expect a mix of cold and warm start scenarios where HSAPA can be expected to demonstrate superior performance than in cold start scenario. ",

We use two colors: red and green to represent the sentiment attention scores and product attention scores respectively. The lightness/darkness of the color is proportional to the magnitude of the attention score. There are a few interesting patterns to note. First, for the sentiment attention layer, the words that are assigned large weights have sentiment that is close to the overall sentiment of the review. For instance, in the example 2 the overall sentiment of the review is positive (5 out of 5). Although there are several negative words such as \"no\" and \"don't\", the positive words/phrases like \"great\", \"remain sharp\" are still assigned higher attention weights. This observation is consistent with our previous hypothesis that the word importance in a review can be affected by review sentiment. Second, the attributes or descriptive words of an attribute of the product in a review text gain higher weights from the product attention layer. For instance, in the first example the descriptive words \"fit\", \"enough\" and the noun \"tub\" are assigned relatively high attention scores. Third, the combination of the important words captured by two attention layers can give us a brief and thorough summary of a review. It may also visually explain why the combination of these two can achieve a better result compared to a single attention layer.",

Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of each attention layer of proposed model in both scenarios. Both attention layers contribute to the improvement in performance. In the warm start scenario, the product attention layer is able to attain better performance than in cold scenario since it has access to reviews for targeted products. In this work, we evaluate review helpfulness from the perspective of review quality.
