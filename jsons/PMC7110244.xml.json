As described in our previous report [26], reverse transcription was performed on DNase-treated total RNA. The cDNA was synthesized from mRNA with oligo(dT)12\u201318 primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The cDNA samples were diluted (1:10) and used as template. Specific primers and probes ([26, 27] and table 1) were used in a real-time PCR assay, detected by use of an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The standard curve was generated using serial dilution of plasmids (from \u223c10 to 107 copies) containing the respective cloned gene targets.

Virus-induced CCL5 and activation of CCR5 are required to prevent apoptosis of influenza virus\u2013infected mouse macrophages in vivo and of human macrophages ex vivo [28]. Therefore, we determined whether the expression of chemokine receptors differed between virus-infected adult and neonatal MDMs. Chemokine receptors could bind several members of the same chemokine subgroup with high affinity. Both CCR1 and CCR5 could bind to CCL3 and CCL5 [1, 2, 4, 11]. As shown in figure 5, little change in CCR1 and CCR5 expression was found in H1N1/98-infected MDMs. At the 12-h POI, significantly higher expression of both CCR1 and CCR5 was detected in H9N2/G1-infected adult MDMs than in H1N1/98-infected adult MDMs (CCR1, P=.0025 [figure 5A]; CCR5, P=.0022 [figure 5C]; n=6). Similar to that in adult MDMs, CCR1 expression in H9N2/G1-infected neonatal MDMs displayed a gradual increase with time and, at the 12-h POI, was significantly higher than that in H1N1/98-infected neonatal MDMs (P=.0087; n=6) (figure 5B). However, there was little change in the expression of CCR5 in H1N1/98- or H9N2/G1-infected neonatal MDMs, and <20 gene copies/104 copies of \u03b2-actin were detected (figure 5D)",

Furthermore, significantly higher expression of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10 was found in response to avian influenza viruses, compared with human influenza viruses (figures 2 and 4). Expression of these chemokines is also up-regulated in other viral infections, such as lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and hepatitis C virus infections [29\u201332\n]. The chemokine-dependent trafficking of monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and lymphocytes between the site of infection, the circulation, and the draining lymph nodes provides protective immunity against viral infections. Paradoxically, the same chemokines could exacerbate virus-induced inflammation and pathology via exaggerated cell-mediated responses [1, 2, 31, 32]. Therefore, the rapid and strong chemokine response detected in both adult and neonatal MDMs infected with avian influenza viruses may partially explain the greater clinical severity observed",

Strikingly, the fold increase in CCL3 expression in H5N1/97-infected adult MDMs was significantly higher than that in neonatal MDMs (figure 3). The detrimental effects of CCL3 have been widely studied in viral infections. Higher CCL3, interleukin (IL)\u20136, IL-8, and IL-1 levels have been found in plasma from patients with fatal H5N1 infection than in plasma from survivors [14]. Elevated CCL3 and IFN-\u03b3 levels have been detected in inflammatory tissues from patients with infection-induced hemophagocytic syndrome [33]. Additionally, levels of CCL3, but not of other CC chemokines (CCL2 and CCL5), have been found to be higher in nasopharyngeal secretions from infants with more-severe hypoxic bronchiolitis due to influenza virus [34]. It has been found that less mononuclear cell infiltration and pulmonary edema occurs in gene-deficient CCL3\u2212/\u2212 mice than in wild-type mice during respiratory virus infection [35, 36]. The higher CCL3 response in adult MDMs may be one of the important factors responsible for the age-related severity of avian influenza virus infection in 1997",

The process by which human monocytes mature into tissue macrophages is accompanied by a loss in CCR2 expression, an increase in expression of CCR1 and CCR5, and an enhanced functional response to CCL3 [37, 38]. During influenza virus infection, CCL3 may primarily function through CCR1 or CCR4, and its interaction with CCR5 is limited [39]. Moreover, activation of CCR1 is an early event in the systemic inflammatory response and occurs in various cell types [40, 41]. The trafficking of myeloid cells and neutrophils is disordered in CCR1\u2212/\u2212 mice [41]. Improved survival was detected in gene-deleted CCR1\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with pneumonia virus, compared with that in wild-type mice [42]. We detected the up-regulation of both CCR1 and CCR5 expression in avian virus H9N2/G1\u2013infected adult MDMs; however, only CCR1 expression was up-regulated in H9N2/G1-infected neonatal MDMs (figure 5). These results suggested that the activation of CCR1 may be the major response in macrophages to avian influenza virus. In contrast to H5N1/97-infected adult MDMs, which had a several-fold increase in CCR1 and CCR5 production, H5N1/97-infected neonatal MDMs had a minimal fold increase of CCR1 and CCR5 production at the 7-h POI (figure 6). The difference may be explained by delayed chemokine-receptor activation of neonatal MDMs in response to H5N1/97 virus, compared with that of adult MDMs, or by an intrinsically weaker response in neonatal MDMs. The latter is supported by the observation that there is an age-related increase of CCR5 expression in monocytes, lymphocytes, and NK cells [43]",

Recently, it has been reported that virus-induced CCL5 (but not CCL3 or CCL4) and activation of CCR5 (but not CCR1 or CCR3) are required to prevent apoptosis of influenza virus\u2013infected mouse macrophages in vivo and human macrophages ex vivo [28]. As is shown in our study, significantly higher expression of CCL5 was detected in avian influenza virus\u2013infected human MDMs than in human influenza virus H1N1/98\u2013infected MDMs (figures 2, 3, and 4). In human patients and mouse models, it has been found that the replication of H5N1 virus or H5N1 nonstructural gene reassortant virus is prolonged [14, 44]. We have recently demonstrated that lesser cytopathogenic effects were caused by avian influenza viruses H9N2/G1 and H5N1/97 in Jurkat T cells [23] and other cell types, such as dendritic cells (data not shown), compared with human virus H1N1/98. The lesser cytopathogenic effects or lower percentages of apoptosis in avian influenza virus\u2013infected cells may contribute to the prolonged viral replication, and this process may be a result of the antiapoptotic effects of CCL5 and CCR5",
