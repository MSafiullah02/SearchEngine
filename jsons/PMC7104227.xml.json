These viruses belong to numerous different families and the diseases associated with their infection may range from mild diarrhea to severe neural diseases, flaccid paralysis, with even rare events of myocarditis, respiratory disease or hemorrhagic fever. Nevertheless, the most frequently reported foodborne syndromes are gastroenteritis and hepatitis. This review will be focused on the viruses most commonly found as food contaminants, noroviruses (NoV); the virus causing the most abundant type of hepatitis, hepatitis A virus (HAV); and on another hepatitis virus that represents an emerging foodborne threat, hepatitis E virus (HEV).",

The infection is mostly asymptomatic in children younger than six while the severity increases thereafter, being the illness very severe in those older than sixty (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/). Since the infection induces a life-long immunity, severe infections among adults are rare in endemic regions where most children are infected early in life. By contrast, in non-endemic developed countries the disease occurs mostly in adulthood, mainly as a consequence of consuming contaminated water or food, traveling to endemic regions or having risky sexual practices and hence the likelihood of developing severe symptomatic illness is high [22].",

Genotypic characterization is highly relevant to trace the origin of an outbreak [24, 25\u2022], but also to anticipate the severity of cases. Hepatitis cases associated to subgenotype IIIA have been reported to be more severe, with higher alteration of clinical parameters and requiring longer hospitalization. In a study conducted in Catalonia, covering the decade 2004\u20132013, a significant increase of subgenotype IIIA was detected in 2012 and associated cases were all in toddlers younger than 4 years [26\u2022]. This is an unexpected result since under the age of six years hepatitis A is mostly asymptomatic and thus indicates a more severe outcome compared to other genotypes.",

We have performed for this revision a meta-analysis with all data included in previous studies to balance the worldwide prevalence of subgenotypes in different years. This meta-analysis has revealed that the prevalence of subgenotypes IA, IB and IIIA is of 66%, 14% and 21%, respectively, while their association to fulminant cases is of 30%, 30% and 41%, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that fulminant outcomes associate with infections with viruses belonging to subgenotypes IB and IIIA. From this meta-analysis it can also be inferred that subgenotypes IA, IIIA and IB are the most abundant worldwide. Particularly, IA is the most prevalent genotype followed by IB (particularly in Africa) with the exception of the South Asian continent, including India and Pakistan, where IIIA is the most abundant type. However, it should be pointed out that subgenotype IIIA is rapidly spreading to other parts of the world [27, 28].",

In addition, the low number of contaminating virus particles may not be uniformly distributed and some of the components in the food matrix may be potent inhibitors of molecular assays. Two International Organization for Standardization (ISO) procedures for quantitative and qualitative detection of NoV (GI and GII) and HAV in selected foodstuffs (soft fruits, salad vegetables and bivalve molluscan shellfish), bottled water and food surfaces were published in 2013 (ISO/TS 15216-1 and ISO/TS 15216-2) [45\u2022\u2022]. The availability of these standard methods may set the basis for the formulation of regulatory standards for viruses in food and water in the near future. The following sections describe these validated methods and other published efforts channeled toward the optimization of the virus concentration procedure, as well as approaches aiming at providing added value to the basic viral detection and assisting in the interpretation of a positive result. A general flow chart for the recently developed analytical options for the detection and characterization of viruses in food is shown in Figure 2\n.",

With slight modifications in some instances, the ISO methods have been widely used to screen naturally contaminated sample matrices [46, 47], and several companies also offer commercial kits based on RTqPCR assays closely related to the one used in the ISO validation. However, despite the wide acceptance of the standardized method and its variations among research labs, most studies do not report the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the assay and this complicates comparisons and drawing of general conclusions. Regarding the process control virus, the use of Mengo virus strain MCo or murine norovirus (MNV) is widespread in most studies [48]. Due to the complexity of food matrices, an extraction efficiency above 1% is considered satisfactory. An assay multiplexing HAV, NoV GI, NoV GII and Mengo virus as a process control was optimized and validated on naturally contaminated bivalve mollusks and water samples [49\u2022\u2022]. The quadruplex assay fulfills the ISO requirements, showing in the worst-case scenario an average sensitivity loss of 0.4 logs. Most virus concentration protocols are time-consuming and laborious, and the great variety of food matrices makes selection of a single method not straightforward. For berries, baby spinaches, lettuce and sliced tomatoes for example, alternative methods of extraction in which RNAs are directly extracted from food have shown good performance and shorter times [50, 51]. However, all alternative methods must be validated versus the ISO standard.Box 1Key features of the validated ISO/TS 15216-1 and ISO/TS 15216-2 procedures\n\n",

Factors such as the degree of secondary structure present within the target RTqPCR region, its level of interaction and protection by capsid proteins, the mechanical stability or plasticity of the viral capsid, or the level of viral aggregation within the sample, may cause bias in the application of EMA/PMA-RTqPCR methods.
