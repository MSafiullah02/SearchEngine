Vaccines are major weapons against PRRSV, however, current available vaccines have several limitations. Developing chemical drugs as alternatives is required. On the basis of traditional medical knowledge, we purposely selected 15 natural products originated from Chinese herbs with anti-infectious effects. Their antiviral activities were evaluated by PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect(CPE) on MARC-145 cells and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assay. Compounds ethoxysanguinarine(EOSG) and atractylodinol were found to be the hits which could significantly reduce PRRSV-associated CPE with 50% inhibited concentration(IC 50 ) values of 7.9 and 39.4 \u03bcmol/L, respectively. Meanwhile, compounds ethoxysanguinarine and atractylodinol significantly decreased mRNA expression of ORF7 gene in a dose-dependent manner. Study results suggest that compounds ethoxysanguinarine and atractylodinol may be useful anti-PRRSV drugs for swine industry or the hits for further lead optimization.",

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by PRRSV is characterized by miscarriages, premature farrowing, stillborn pigs, infertility, slow growth, anorexia, fever, cough, dyspnea and so on [4, 5] . PRRSV can transmit via semen, saliva, urine, and aerosol within and between herds [6] [7] [8] . PRRSV was first discovered in the United States in 1987, and swept over the North America and Europe in 1991. To date, even over two decades has gone by since PRRSV emergency. However, it is still a mystery swine disease, and continues to be a serious threat for swine industry, causing great economic losses. Various measures have been taken to control PRRSV. Eradication is an efficient measure, while this method is very expensive and needs early accurate detection in the negative herds. Vaccines have been the major weapon to combat PRRSV. Nevertheless, current commercial vaccines have several limitations. PRRSV-induced immune evasion is becoming serious and none of the vaccines could completely prevent respiratory infection. Up to now, though a great effort has been taken to develop PRRSV vaccines, yet little progress has been made at present [9, 10] .",

Total RNA was isolated via RNA isoTMPlus kit(TaKaRa Biotech., Dalian, China) and kept in 0.02% diethyl pyrocarbonate(DEPC)-treated water at -80 \u00b0C according to the manufacture instructions. All the samples were quantified and the purity was determined on a spectrophotometer by OD 260 /OD 280 ratios. For each sample, 2 \u03bcL of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis via SYBR \u00ae PrimeScript RT \u00ae reagents kit(TaKaRa Biotech., Dalian, China).

            "text": "It is well recognized that natural sources play an essential role in drug discovery. Traditional Chinese medicines have been used for millennia for mankind around the world, especially in China. It is estimated that around 10000 plants have been medicinally used, accounting for over one third of terrestrial higher plants [17] . It was reported that 122 plant-derived natural products exhibit therapeutic effects, and over 70% of them is related with ethno-knowledge [18] . As far as epidemic diseases are concerned, hundreds of herbs have been recorded to have anti-infectious effects, such as Lonicera japonica Thunb, Isatis tinctoria L., Viola philippica Car., and so on. Viral diseases are considered to be related to murrain which has been recognized earlier by Chinese ancient doctors. Therefore, there remains a great interest in searching for antiviral agents from natural origin. New methods like the solidification of floating organic drop liquid phase microextraction(SFODLPM) and HPLC are continuously applied to the extract of active compounds [19] , and even there is ongoing research of further development cancer therapeutic drugs [20] . However, anti-PRRSV efforts on small molecules from the nature have been neglected. In this study, we selected 15 representative compounds from 7 herbs on the basis of traditional medicinal knowledge and modern scientific research achievements of Chinese medicine. PRRSV-induced CPE assay shows that ethoxysanguinarine(EOSG) and atractylodinol exhibited significant inhibitory effects on PRRSV with IC 50 values of 7.9 and 39.4 \u03bcmol/L, respectively (Table 1) . RT-PCR assay demonstrates that EOSG and atractylodinol significantly decreased mRNA expression of ORF7 gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2) . Sanguinarine(SG) is an alkaloid, which has been found mainly in the plants of Papaveraceae family, such as Sanguinaria canadesis, Eomecon chionantha, Corydalis edulis, Chelidonium majus and Macleya cordata that have been medicinally used for hundreds of years [21] [22] [23] . SG as a representative agent contained in the above plants has been well studied in veterinary and human phytopreparations [24] , which shows broad antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor activities. EOSG is a stable sanguinarine derivative prepared in alcohol. Up to now, anti-PRRSV effect is poorly understood. CPE assay indicates that EOSG has potent anti-PRRSV activity, which has been further confirmed by a RT-PCR assay, implying that EOSG could inhibit mRNA in a dose-dependant manner. Atractylodinol is a furan derivative with a polyacetylene side chain. This compound is present in Atractylodes lancea, a typical Chinese medicine. It was recorded in ancient book that the smoke of A. lancea could prevent murrain transmission. We thus selected some compounds from this herb to test their anti-PRRSV activity. Atractylodinol was found to be against PRRSV in CPE assay and exhibited a good dose-dependant effect in RT-PCR assay, whereas other sesquiterpenoids are inactive. It was noted that atractylodin and atractylodinol are structurally similar compounds, while they showed a distinct anti-PRRSV effect difference, which may imply that the end alcohol group in the structure of atractylodinol is important for keeping the activity.",

SG is naturally abundant, and the stable EOSG could be easily prepared by dissolving SG in ethanol. Atractylodinol has a simple structure which could be chemically synthesized.
