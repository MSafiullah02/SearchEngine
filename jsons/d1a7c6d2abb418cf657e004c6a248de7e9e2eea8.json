In acute otitis media, middle ear effusion is present behind the tympanic membrane with signs of middle ear inflammation. The presence of middle ear effusion without acute inflammation, either persisting after acute otitis media or occurring de novo, is defined as otitis media with effusion. Although acute otitis media is generally considered to be a bacterial infection, it is acknowledged that respiratory viruses play a role in the development of acute otitis media by increasing the adherence of bacteria to epithelial cells and by virus-induced dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, which interferes with clearance of middle ear effusion. In addition, host-mediated responses to viral infections such as production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators may contribute to the pathology of otitis media [Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003; Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2006] . The persistence of viruses in the middle ear may also lead to relapse of acute otitis media, even if the initial acute otitis media episode was cleared, and may therefore contribute to the long-term presence of middle ear effusion [Rovers et al., 2004] .",

            "text": "Using culture methods, viruses have been found in the nasopharynx of 30-50% of children with acute otitis media and in 10-20% of middle ear effusion specimens [Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003] . The use of more sensitive PCR techniques and the ability to detect novel viruses such as human bocavirus (HBoV), polyomaviruses (PyV), human metapneumovirus, and human rhinovirus C (HRV C) described recently has significantly increased these percentages, with one study indicating that a virus was present in the nasopharynx of approximately 90% of children with acute otitis media [Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003] . Studies showing protection against acute otitis media development by immunization with influenza vaccines and the demonstration that experimental viral infection of healthy volunteers resulted in otologic changes, further suggest a role for viruses in acute otitis media pathogenesis [Buchman et al., 2002; Marchisio et al., 2009] . Data is inconsistent regarding the importance of specific viruses in acute otitis media. In studies using viral culture and antigen detection methods, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most prevalent virus in the nasopharynx and middle ear of children with acute otitis media, whereas a study using PCR assays indicated that human rhinovirus (HRV) was predominant [Pitkaranta et al., 1998; Heikkinen et al., 1999; Yano et al., 2009 ]. To gain a better understanding of the potential role for specific viruses in otitis media, a multiplex real-time PCR (RT PCR) and traditional PCR assays were used to determine the presence of nucleic acids of human rhinoviruses (HRV; types A, B, and C), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV; types A and B), bocavirus (HBoV), adenovirus (HAdV), enterovirus (EV), coronaviruses (CoV; types 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), influenza viruses (types A, B, and C), parainfluenza viruses (PIV; types 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B), human metapneumovirus (HMV), and polyomaviruses (PyV; types KI and WU) in the nasopharynx of children between 6 and 36 months of age either with (n \u00bc 180) or without (n \u00bc 66) a history of recurrent acute otitis media and in 238 middle ear effusion samples collected from 143 children with persistent middle ear effusion due to recurrent acute otitis media. The association of the presence of specific viruses in the nasopharynx and the middle ear of children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media was investigated to determine the capacity of specific viruses to enter and/or persist in the middle ear. In addition, specific associations between viral and bacterial pathogens were investigated. Together this data will further the understanding of the potential role for specific viruses in otitis media and may contribute to the design of better treatment and prevention strategies for otitis media.",

Children requiring the insertion of ventilation tubes for persistent middle ear effusion without a history of acute otitis media were not included. Children undergoing general surgery (predominantly orthopedics, strabismus, circumcision, cryptorchidism, hypospadias repair) and with no history of any form of otitis media, were recruited as healthy controls.

Briefly, nucleic acid was extracted from a 200 ml volume of sample using a modified liquid sample extraction protocol on an automated extraction instrument (Xtractorgene, CAS1820, Corbett, Brisbane, Australia). Standardized amounts of equine herpesvirus and MS2 RNA coliphage were added to the lysis buffer to monitor the efficiency of sample extraction, the removal of PCR inhibitors and the cDNA process. Negative controls were included in the extraction process after every five clinical samples and treated as samples for the completion of the assay. Nucleic acid (8 ml) was added to two multiplex PCR mixes (12 ml) containing 27 and 7 primer pairs. Following 20 amplification cycles, liquid handling robots were used to transfer 1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of that product to several RT PCR (20 ml) mixes containing 2-3 primer pairs. RT PCRs (40 cycles) were conducted in Rotor-Gene 6000 instruments (Corbett, Brisbane, Australia). The multiplex RT PCR assay detects adenovirus types B-E, bocavirus, coronavirus types 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63, influenza virus types A-C, parainfluenza virus types 1-4, polyomavirus types KI and WU, and RSV types A and B. Separate semi-nested PCR assays were performed to detect enterovirus, HRV and human metapneumovirus and PCR products were further characterized by DNA sequencing. Additional characterization of the HRV types utilized primers directed against the VP1 and VP4/2 regions of the genome [Coiras et al., 2004; Ledford et al., 2004; McIntyre et al., 2010] .",

This suggests that a respiratory virus may be present in the nasopharynx for a limited amount of time and supports the validity of using PCR to detect ''true'' respiratory infections. However, next to measuring the presence of viruses, the quantification of viral-loads will be important to determine the importance of specific viruses in disease. In this study the samples were not collected during an acute otitis media episode and therefore a causal relationship between the viral nucleic acid detected in the nasopharynx and otitis media pathogenesis cannot be confirmed. Others have shown that respiratory viruses are isolated from the nasopharynx during an acute otitis media episode in 30-50% of cases using PCR [Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2004; Yano et al., 2009] . Longitudinal studies have also demonstrated that the presence of a virus in the nasopharynx is associated with the subsequent development of otitis media [Winther et al., 2007; Chonmaitree et al., 2008; Alper et al., 2009] . None of these studies had as high detection rates as described in the current study, potentially because a wider range of viruses, such as the more recently discovered HBoV, polyomaviruses, and human metapneumovirus, was tested for here. In addition, molecular methods were used for the detection of all viruses, whereas other studies used combinations of PCR-, antigen detection-, and culture methods.",

Even though in the current study the classical otitis-prone definition was not used [Howie et al., 1975] , children were at the severe end of the otitis media spectrum with a median of seven acute otitis media episodes before the insertion of ventilation tubes. The difference in detection rates of viral nucleic acids in the nasopharynx between this group and a group of children without a history or recurrent acute otitis media was most significant for RSV with an odds ratio of 9.1, supporting a potential role for RSV in otitis media as described by others [Heikkinen et al., 1999; Patel et al., 2007; Yano et al., 2009] . HRV nucleic acid was the type detected most frequently in the middle ear (46%) of children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media which is in accordance with several other studies and suggests HRV may be important in otitis media [Pitkaranta et al., 1998; Blomqvist et al., 2002; Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2004; Chantzi et al., 2006; Kleemola et al., 2006; Ruohola et al., 2006] . This role for HRV in otitis media may be attributable to the capacity of HRV to induce the release of bacteria from biofilm [Chattoraj et al., 2011] or the persistence of HRV in adenoid tissue [Pitkaranta et al., 2002; , 2004] . In addition to the classical HRV species A and B, a third rhinovirus species, HRV C, was identified recently [Arden et al., 2006; Lamson et al., 2006] . It has been suggested that HRV C causes more severe disease, however, debate is ongoing [Arden and Mackay, 2010; Gern, 2010] . HRV A was the predominant HRV type in the nasopharynx and middle ear effusion of children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media described here, whereas HRV C was the most common type in the nasopharynx of healthy children, which does not support a predominant role for HRV C compared to other HRV types in otitis media.",

Since the discovery of HBoV in 2005 [Allander et al., 2005] debate on the role of HBoV in respiratory disease has been ongoing. Detection rates of HBoV in the nasopharynx of asymptomatic children vary widely from <10% [Kesebir et al., 2006; Brieu et al., 2008; Garcia-Garcia et al., 2008; von Linstow et al., 2008] to two studies describing an infection rate of 40% [Longtin et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2010] . The findings in these latter studies which included otitisprone children were similar to our observations for children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media. In the current study the detection rate of HBoV nucleic acid in the middle ear effusion was relatively low compared to the detection rate of HBoV in the nasopharynx, which is in agreement with findings from others [Ruohola et al., 2006; Beder et al., 2009; Rezes et al., 2009] . Additional viruses discovered recently, the polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) [Allander et al., 2007; Gaynor et al., 2007] were detected in the nasopharynx of 15.2% of healthy controls and 36.1% of children with a history or recurrent acute otitis media. These rates are high compared with other studies where WUPyV and KIPyV is detected in 1-6% of respiratory tract secretions collected during acute respiratory disease Rhinovirus positive 28 7 (25.0) 5 (17.9) 2 (7.1) 2 (7.1) 2 (7.1) 1 (3.6) 1 (3.6) 1 (3.6) -Rhinovirus negative 38 6 (15.8) 5 (13.2) 4 (10.5) 4 (10.5) 2 (5.3) 4 (10.5) 3 (7.9) 0 (0 [ Babakir-Mina et al., 2011] , but they are more similar to a recent study where KIPyV and WUPyV were detected by real-time PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs from 7 (3.0%) and 38 (16.4%) of 232 children with respiratory tract infections [Teramoto et al., 2011] . In addition, the seroprevalence of KIPyV and WUPyV in adults is 55% and 69%, respectively, suggesting that exposure to these viruses, probably in childhood, is very common [Kean et al., 2009] . The fact that in the current study nucleic acid from HBoV, KIPyV, and WUPyV were detected frequently in asymptomatic controls and not commonly in middle ear effusion samples, may suggest their role in otitis media is limited, but further studies are required.",

            "text": "In the current study RSV was associated most frequently with the presence of other viruses in the nasopharynx, which may suggest that RSV facilitates subsequent infections with other viruses. Conversely, a virus that is detected on its own and not associated with other viruses, for example, HRV or adenovirus, may be more important in disease pathogenesis. In nasopharyngeal samples from children with a history of recurrent acute otitis media, a positive association of adenovirus with S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis was observed. A similar positive association between adenovirus and M. catarrhalis was found in children in a semi-arid zone of Western Australia, however, a negative association between adenovirus and S. pneumoniae was described in this cohort when using adjusted statistical models [Jacoby et al., 2007; Moore et al., 2010] . A chinchilla model showing adenovirus does not promote otitis media due to M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae does not support results described in the current article [Bakaletz et al., 1995; Tong et al., 2000] . In the middle ear, a positive association between HRV and NTHi was observed which was not noted in the nasopharynx, which may suggest that interactions between pathogens are dependent on the local environment. These conflicting results highlight the complexity of pathogen interactions. The interpretation of data from animal models, different human populations, sampling environments, and various statistical models are challenging, further emphasizing that more studies are necessary.",
