In 2014, our group\nintroduced the novel concept of the \u201cpersonalized\u201d or\n\u201cdisease-specific\u201d protein corona, in which we revealed that the composition\nof protein coronas on the surface of identical NPs differ dramatically depending on the type\nof disease(s) the plasma donors have had (see Figure 1 as an example of corona patterns of various diseases including the common cold,\nwhich is a viral infection).19,20 The concept of disease-specific NP protein corona19\u221221 opens the door to unique diagnostic applications. In other words,\nidentical NPs may form different protein corona profiles in patients with various diseases,\nsignificantly affecting the safety and therapeutic efficacy of the NPs across patients;\nhowever, those very differences in the protein corona that constitute a huge shortcoming for\ntherapeutic applications can be exploited for disease detection ex\nvivo.",
