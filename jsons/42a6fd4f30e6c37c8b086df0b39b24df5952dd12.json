The macrophage population exhibits strong plasticity that varies according to the stimuli in the microenvironment of lesions M1 profile promotes a Th1 pattern of cytokines and a microbicidal function and M2 is related to Th2 cytokines and immunomodulatory response. We investigated the population of M1 and M2 polarized macrophages in human cutaneous lesions. A total of 27 biopsies from human lesions were submitted to an immunohistochemistry protocol using antibodies to detect M1 and M2 macrophages (Arginase-1, CD163, iNOS, RBP-J and cMAF). We could observe high number of cells expressing Arginase1, CD163 and c-MAF that correspond to elements of the M2 profile of macrophage, over iNOS and RBP-J (elements of the M1 profile). The results suggest a predominant phenotype of M2 macrophages, which have an immunomodulatory role and probably contributing to chronicity of Lacaziosis.",
