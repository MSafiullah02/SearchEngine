            "text": "Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection with short turn\u2010around\u2010time (TAT) is pivotal for rapid decisions regarding treatment and infection control.1, 2 Current diagnostics for the detection of influenza virus and RSV include direct antigen detection (DAD), virus isolation by cell culture (VIC), and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT). DAD is rapid, but had been shown to be of limited sensitivity compared to VIC.3, 4 In the past, VIC has been the gold standard for sensitive and specific identification of community\u2010acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) including influenza viruse and RSV. However, VIC requires skilled technicians, dedicated cell culture equipments, and a TAT of several days, which limits the use of this technique to specialized laboratories.5 By contrast, NAT has the advantage of a shorter TAT of approximately 6 to 8 hours, and the detection of multiple pathogens by parallel testing in a semiquantitative format and as multiplexNAT. More recently, NAT platforms became available for detecting influenza viruse as point\u2010of\u2010care tests (POCTs).3, 6, 7 Besides short TAT of less than 2 hours, cartridge\u2010based POCTs are simple to operate, which permit their use in near\u2010patient settings without extensive laboratory training. However, negative results are difficult to interpret since POCT may have a limited sensitivity or the influenza\u2010like illnesses in question may be due to other CARVs not covered by the POCT. For this reason, comparison with a multiplexNAT assay is of considerable advantage.3 In fact, a number of centres are exploring deep\u2010sequencing to detect other CARVs.8 The Cobas Liat Influenza A/B and RSV real\u2010time assay (LIAT) is of interest, since both influenza virus\u2010A, \u2010B as well as the RSV\u2010A and \u2010B are targeted, all of which cause significant morbidity in younger children and older adults during the cold season, and can therefore guide initial decisions regarding antiviral therapy as well as infection control measures.9, 10, 11, 12\n",

In our laboratory, the LIAT was easy to handle including inexperienced personnel and features like barcode reading and direct transfer of the results into the laboratory information system saved time and eliminated error\u2010prone manual procedures. A hands\u2010on time of less than 5 minutes plus an assay time of 15 minutes resulted in a TAT of 20 minutes that can be reached even for personal with minimal training. Thus, the LIAT permits rapid responses including decisions regarding antiviral therapy for influenza as well as to cohort patients as part of infection control in institution settings including outpatient clinics, emergency rooms, and intensive care units.",

            "text": "The following limitations should be noted. First, batch testing of patient samples is not possible and at the peak season of influenza and RSV, the sequential testing may result in the loss of the TAT advantage (3 samples per hour, 24 per 8 hours, 72 per 24 hours). However, it can be partly compensated for by direct and parallel testing on more than one LIAT instrument. Second, LIAT lacks the identification of influenza virus\u2010A subtypes. Detection of influenza virus\u2010A subtypes may influence isolation procedures in hospital settings. In addition, in immunocompromised patients may be at risk for dual infections, which is rare and usually one pathogen is dominant. In such cases, subsequent multiplexNAT or QNAT provide semiquantitative results that are helpful to identify the main driver of the infection. Because the LIAT is easy to handle, the testing system may be attractive for being used by personnel not trained as professional laboratory analysts. However, in our practice, a qualification program with corresponding documentation and requalification every 1 or 2 years need to be performed in accordance with laboratory regulations, and not only when failing internal and external quality assurance programs.",

In this study, the sensitivity of the LIAT seemed to be equivalent or slightly increased over current multiplexNAT and comparable to specific QNAT. The specificity was similar to the multiplexNAT. Thus, LIAT seems useful for rapid testing and management decisions regarding infection control and therapy, and could be followed by QNAT to document viral replication and clearance if needed, and/or by multiplexNAT to detect other respiratory pathogens.",
