These might include concerns re household job security and business viability (especially for private practitioners), through to cancelation of weddings and travel plans, and a loss of self-identity (eg, male colleagues are shaving their beards to ensure that mask fit is adequate for personal protection). These stressors may culminate in grief, anxiety and/or depression. More heart-wrenching aspects might include being unable to hug loved ones due to social distancing, or considering preferences for medical treatment in the event of critical illness for ourselves and those for whom we are responsible. We may experience anxiety about becoming infected and passing on the infection to others. We may also be anxious about the severity of the illness experienced. This may be particularly relevant if you or those close to you are at increased risk medically (eg, pregnancy, immunosuppression, older age) 1 and/or socially (eg, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, refugees, or those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, all of whom are typically underserved by the healthcare system). Caring responsibilities for children or the elderly introduce additional considerations and stress. Many avenues that we might ordinarily use to manage these stressors may no longer be available due to social distancing, governmental closures of non-essential services, and infection control requirements.",

This may involve re-skilling and redeploying staff to expanded intensive care units, and discharging patients from our care earlier than usual to maintain intensive care and hospital bed access and flow. In outpatient and private practice, treatment may be able to be provided via telehealth technology. We are also required to work within new confines of infection control, where we might have to reconsider standard approaches to assessment and management of equipment. These changes will influence how we interact with patients and their families to manage their clinical conditions or involve them in clinical research. Local and global perspectives, and federal and state recommendations, also influence the rapidly changing situation. With so many modifications to decide upon and implement with urgency, it is important that we do not reinvent the wheel where resources already exist to help us.",

The recommendations published in this issue suggest that physiotherapy interventions are likely limited in COVID-19 patients when in the intensive care unit, 2 so an important role will be advising and supporting colleagues on how best to exercise these compromised, hypoxaemic patients on the wards. For those patients who do survive intensive care, reducing ongoing disability will be an important role for physiotherapists.",

Many hospitals will have issued directives about how to appropriately manage research activity including contingency planning, communication, management of participants, notification of protocol breaches, suspension of research, and communicating with ethical review committees. The Australian Clinical Trials Alliance has also provided valuable resources that address issues such as: suspending/ restarting a trial, remote monitoring, replacing in-person visits with phone calls, and reducing the number of participant monitoring visits. 19 A critical point for physiotherapy researchers to note is this: if a trial is amended to accommodate new restrictions and organisational directives, the registered trial protocol should be immediately updated on the registry to explain what is being changed and why. Otherwise, the opportunity to publish in high-impact journals may be limited, given the submitted trial must be completely consistent with the registered protocol. Also consider liaising early with funding bodies about any anticipated delays or change in research plans. Physiotherapy research higher degree students should keep up to date with university directives, and ensure regular communcation with their supervisors to develop and modify research plans.",

The recommendations published in this issue pull a lot of useful information together in one place for acute care physiotherapists. 2 However in an ever-changing environment it is relatively static, which the authors intend to address with a future update(s). Other alternatives in this dynamic clinical situation include a living systematic review as a way to \"seamlessly connect evidence and practice\", 20,21 or a clinical practice guideline following the methodology as set out by the National Health and Medical Research Council. 22 Another rapid and clinically useful approach would be to adopt a model of crowdsourcing to identify the challenges, and then harness both clinical and research expertise to address them. 23, 24 World events such as wars and the polio epidemic have fundamentally changed the way healthcare is delivered. Clinicians practise in ways previously considered impossible; road blocks to rapidly implementing new models of care are removed. The opportunity to evaluate these changes on important patient outcomes should not be missed.
