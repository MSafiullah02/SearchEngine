Because it contains the battery, the pulse generator is relatively bulky. It is typically placed in the chest or abdomen, with the leads connecting to it on one end and to the myocardium on the other. Approximately 30% of patients with chronic heart failure have electrical dyssynchrony in myocardial activation11, and require cardiac resynchronization therapies (CRTs). Existing CRTs rely on the use of multiple intracardiac leads to pace both ventricles in a synchronized sequence12. While clinical improvements are generally achieved, six-month nonresponder rates have been reported to be as high as 32\u201343%11,13, which is partially attributed to anatomic constraints of lead positioning14. Transvenous leads are also associated with various complications such as lead dislodgement15, tricuspid valve dysfunction16, and thromboembolism17, etc., which would be solved with leadless pacemaker technologies18\u201320.",

On the contrary, electromagnetic energy in near- and mid-field supplies sufficient power to medical implants4,24, as magnetic fields penetrate through tissue as in free space25. Utilization of such energy, however, poses two challenges: first, achieving resonant coupling in the low-frequency regime could often result in over-size of the implant due to the associated long wavelength. Second, the magnetic field decays as the inverse cube of distance limiting the maximum operating range26. This study seeks to mitigate the first challenge by achieving a relatively miniaturized, flexible and lightweight design to minimize the invasiveness for epicardial implantation27,28. For the second, the power consumption of the pacemaker is substantially reduced by customizing a low-power integrated circuit (IC), which alleviates the need for the incident power and, therefore, extends the distance of operation.",

To demonstrate wireless CRT, two such pacemakers were epicardially implanted on the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) in a porcine model for synchronized biventricular (BiV) pacing with controllable interventricular offsets. BiV pacing with zero offset achieves a QRS duration and hemodynamic response comparable to those of the intrinsic non-pathologic heartbeat. Closed-chest BiV pacing was further demonstrated with the specific absorption rate (SAR) orders of magnitude lower than the safety regulation limit. This work is the first demonstration of the multisite CRT based on batteryless and leadless pacemakers with improved clinical outcomes in both interventricular synchronization and cardiac stroke volumes. The wireless powering strategy can be applied to various other medical implants as well.",

The link efficiency as a function of Tx-Rx distance is shown in Fig. 3e. The 13.56 MHz shows a slower decay because of the slightly larger Tx coil. Both wireless power transfer links are validated in benchtop tests. With 1 W Tx power, 40.68 MHz and 13.56 MHz links render the maximum operating distance of 8.5 cm and 11 cm as shown in Fig. 3f,g, respectively. It shows that while the efficiency of near-field inductive coupling systems decays according to the inverse-cubic relationship, \u00b5W-level wirelessly powered implants can still obtain a considerable range of operation.

BiV pacing with LV-lead 20 ms and 40 ms are demonstrated in Supplementary Videos S1 and S2 with 10-fold speed reduction. The QRS duration in the ECG tracing has been well used as a prognostic indicator of the clinical effectiveness of synchronized BiV pacing14,33. The widening of QRS duration is clinically associated with worsening hemodynamics due to electrical blocks in the conduction system. In this study, the QRS durations corresponding to different single-site and BiV pacing modalities are demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. S3 and the result is summarized in Fig. 4g. The QRS duration of the intrinsic non-pathologic heartbeat is 60 ms and BiV pacing with zero offset renders a similar value. BiV pacing with LV leading by 20 ms and 40 ms also outperforms single-site RV and LV pacing. In contrast, BiV pacing with RV leading by 40 ms shows a worsened result, suggesting a contradiction to the inherent conduction. Diagnostic electrophysiology (EP) catheters (Boston Scientific, MA) inserted into the RV and coronary sinus (CS) successfully measured reproducible changes in myocardial wavefronts associated with each pacing modality as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4a\u2013d. Distinct pacing artifacts with the programmed offsets are also evident.",

The porcine chest is about 5 cm thick so that implanted pacemakers are about 6\u20138 cm from the body surface as shown in Fig. 6a. The 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz pacemakers were implanted on the RV and LV, respectively, with their positions indicated in the fluorescent image in Fig. 6b. Tx coils were placed at approximately 0.5\u20131 cm outside the sutured chest as shown in Fig. 6c. Closed-chest RV pacing and LV pacing were enabled with Tx power as low as 25 dBm (0.3 W) and 29 dBm (0.8 W), respectively. BiV pacing is also successfully performed in the closed-chest setting as shown in Supplementary Video S3. Figure 6d demonstrates the intrinsic ECGs in the closed-chest setting. The ECGs for RV pacing, LV pacing and BiV pacing with LV-lead 20 ms are shown in Fig. 6e\u2013g, respectively. A section of the QRS waveform during BiV pacing as shown in Fig. 6h evidently shows the pacing artifacts with a programed 20 ms interval.",

The current embodiment of this technology requires the use of a standard dual-chamber pacemaker with only the LV wirelessly paced via ultrasound power transfer, thus limiting the potential benefits of leadless pacing. The implantation of a hardware in the LV endocardium also necessitates a retroaortic access coursing through the arterial system. Because the pacing lead is placed on the LV endocardium, antiplatelet therapy is warranted. Our technology, however, does not have such limitations. The proposed work demonstrates synchronized leadless pacing over multiple sites for the first time, and this approach can potentially offer more flexibility and advantages in customizing CRTs for different individuals. In the comparison of the wireless powering strategies, magnetic fields in inductively coupling systems are not affected by biological tissues, while ultrasound power transfer essentially works through vibrations, which could deteriorate over air-filled viscera and obstructions, such as lungs and bones36.",

They were implanted on the RV and LV of a porcine model, respectively, which successfully demonstrated the leadless CRT. Different pacing modalities, i.e., single-site pacing and BiV pacing with different offsets, were studied, and BiV pacing showed improvements in the QRS duration and cardiac stroke volumes. The closed-chest leadless BiV pacing was further validated. The 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz links only required the Tx power of 0.3 W and 0.8 W, respectively, which lead to SARs 2\u20133 orders of magnitude below the safety threshold.
