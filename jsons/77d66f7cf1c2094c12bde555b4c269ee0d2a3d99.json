As a respiratory illness, the symptoms of the virus in humans include cough, fever, and shortness of breath [1] . Thus far, there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 infection. Hence, some infected people have become seriously ill, and thus died. In addition, the globalized arena has enabled the virus to spread across many nations.",

Further, because the period of emergency response against COVID-19 has been relatively short, each neighboring nation should be quick to apply the lessons learned from the transition. One significant difference between the self-interesteoriented response and the shared-interesteoriented response is the absence or presence of an integrated emergency management system (IEMS). An IEMS aims to form various networks among the stakeholders for emergency response [4] . In the self-interesteoriented response, the stakeholders pursue their own interests because the extent of the networks formed among them is not so strong in terms of cooperation, transparency, and specialization. In the shared-interesteoriented response, the stakeholders embrace their shared interests because the level of networks formed among them is substantially high.",
