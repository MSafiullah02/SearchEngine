            "text": "The most common Bartonella species isolated from cats is B. henselae. Less commonly, cats are infected with Bartonella clarridgeiae or Bartonella koehlerae, which also have been linked to human disease.5., 8. Young cats (\u22641 year) are more likely than older cats to be bacteremic, and stray or feral cats are more likely to be bacteremic than pet cats.5., 9., 10. Older cats are more likely to be seropositive than young cats, which likely reflects the increased chance of exposure over time. The prevalence of Bartonella bacteremia in cats is also highest in warm, humid climates (e.g., 68% in the Philippines), whereas it is low in colder climates (e.g., 0% in Norway).5 At least two genotypes of B. henselae infect cats, type Houston-1 (type I) and type Marseille (type II). B. henselae type Marseille predominates among cats in the western United States, western continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia; type Houston-1 is dominant in Asia (Japan and the Philippines).5 However, within a given country, the prevalence of these types varies among cat populations, and type Houston-1 is more often isolated from humans with bartonellosis, even when type Marseille is more prevalent in the cat population. Some molecular typing methods reveal an even broader genetic diversity among feline strains, and most of the strains that infect humans cluster in a limited number of groups.\n",

Unfortunately, this correlates poorly with bacteremia. In addition, serologic cross-reactivity occurs among Bartonella species so seroprevalence studies cannot be Bartonella species-specific. The prevalence of antibodies to B. v. berkhoffii in dogs is highest in tropical or subtropical regions. For example, seroprevalences as high as 47% were detected in stray dogs from Morocco.14 In the southeastern United States, the prevalence of B. henselae antibodies in healthy dogs was 10%; a higher prevalence (27%) was found in sick dogs.15 Risk factors identified in dogs in the southeastern United States were tick exposure, residence in a rural environment, roaming, and outdoor exposure.16 The prevalence of B. henselae antibodies in sick dogs from the western United States is less than 2%.17\n",

Bartonella is thought to cause vasculoproliferative disease via cytokine-induced stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis. Virulence factors characterized in Bartonella species include adhesins, heme acquisition mechanisms, type IV secretion systems, and a low-potency lipopolysaccharide, among others.20 Host immunocompromise, such as due to genetic susceptibility (e.g., breed-related immunodeficiency syndromes), poor nutrition, overcrowding, co-infections with other pathogens, immunosuppressive drug treatment, or defects in normal host barriers (such as congenital valvular disease in dogs with endocarditis), may also influence whether disease ultimately develops in infected dogs and cats.",

Infection with Bartonella was identified in 6 (19%) of 31 dogs with culture-negative endocarditis in California.61 Worldwide, the DNA of several Bartonella species has been detected in the heart valves of dogs with endocarditis. The most common species identified has been B. v. berkhoffii. In dogs, Bartonella endocarditis usually involves the aortic valve, although the mitral valve is occasionally affected, so the possibility of bartonellosis should not be ruled out in dogs with mitral valve endocarditis. Dogs with Bartonella endocarditis are more likely to be afebrile and more likely to have congestive heart failure than dogs with other causes of endocarditis, and their median survival time is shorter (Figure 52-3\n).61 Complications of Bartonella endocarditis include thromboembolic disease and neutrophilic polyarthritis.",

Bartonella was detected in a dog with peliosis hepatis and a dog with bacillary angiomatosis, rare conditions that are strongly associated with Bartonella infection in humans.54., 60. Peliosis hepatis and bacillary angiomatosis are vasculoproliferative diseases characterized by the presence of blood-filled proliferations of vascular tissue in the liver and skin, respectively. Based on case reports and seroprevalence studies, Bartonella is suspected to cause polyarthritis, epistaxis, thrombocytopenia, and/or splenomegaly in dogs.17 However, these associations could also reflect the presence of other detected or undetected, co-transmitted vector-borne pathogens that cause these disorders. Bartonella has been investigated for its role in canine lymphoma62; neurologic disease63; splenic disorders including lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, hemangiosarcoma, and fibrohistiocytic nodules64; idiopathic cavitary effusion65; and idiopathic rhinitis.66 As for cats, the role that Bartonella plays in these conditions, if any, is unclear and requires further study.",

However, blood culture requires special techniques and can be insensitive because of the relapsing nature of bacteremia. In contrast to the situation in cats, culture has especially low sensitivity in dogs because of the low level of bacteremia in dogs (especially when they act as incidental hosts and develop disease). Blood for culture should be obtained using sterile technique and the blood placed in EDTA-containing tubes, and then chilled or frozen during shipment. Collection of blood into plastic EDTA tubes allows the tubes to be frozen directly, which releases organisms from erythrocytes after which they are plated onto special media. Blood should be sent to laboratories familiar with the culture of these fastidious organisms, and the laboratories should be contacted for specific instructions regarding specimen collection and submission. Special media (such as fresh chocolate agar, or brain-heart infusion agar enriched with 5% to 10% blood) and culture conditions (5% CO2, temperatures of 35\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C) are used to enhance the likelihood of isolation of Bartonella.62 Extended incubation times of up to 6 to 8 weeks are often required. Serial Bartonella blood cultures may enhance the chance of a positive result. The use of an insect growth medium (Bartonella Alpha Proteobacteria Growth Medium, or BAPGM) that is enriched with multiple micronutrients and defibrinated sheep blood for pre-enrichment culture of blood and potentially other tissues, followed by PCR assay of the liquid culture and subinoculation of the liquid culture onto agar plates, may enhance the sensitivity of culture for diagnosis of Bartonella infections of dogs. It also has the potential to yield other fastidious organisms not cultured under routine conditions that may play a role in endocarditis.70\n",

If serologic testing is performed in dogs, at a minimum it should include testing for B. henselae, B. v. berkhoffii, B. rochalimae, and B. clarridgeiae. Measurement of serum antibodies to Bartonella has a limited ability to help determine whether a sick animal has an active Bartonella infection. In both cats and dogs, bacteremia can occur in the absence of detectable antibodies (see Figure 52-2), and seropositive cats and dogs are not always bacteremic. Fewer than half of antibody-positive cats are bacteremic, and 3% to 15% of antibody-negative cats are bacteremic.67 Because of this, serology is not recommended for routine diagnosis of Bartonella infection in cats. Because of the low sensitivity of PCR and culture in dogs, serology could be considered when these assays and routine blood cultures are negative (or in conjunction with PCR and culture) to support a diagnosis of Bartonella endocarditis (which is usually associated with high antibody titers).",

            "text": "Cats are the major reservoirs for B. henselae, the principal cause of CSD in immunocompetent humans. CSD is characterized by formation of a pustule at the site of inoculation (a cat scratch) within 14 days, followed by development of local lymphadenopathy and malaise 1 to 3 weeks after the scratch (or bite), which can persist for weeks to months. Most cases of CSD are self-limiting after several months and respond minimally to antimicrobial drug treatment. Occasionally CSD is complicated by other disorders such as encephalopathy, relapsing bacteremia, osteomyelitis, neuroretinitis, or endocarditis, which require antimicrobial drug treatment. Vasculoproliferative diseases such as bacillary peliosis (e.g., peliosis hepatis) and bacillary angiomatosis (Figure 52-7\n) are among the most common complications in immunocompromised humans.20 Young cats are most often implicated in transmission to humans, because young cats are more likely to be bacteremic than older cats. Dogs are less likely to act as reservoirs for human disease when compared with cats, because the prevalence of Bartonella infection and the magnitude of bacteremia in dogs are lower than that in cats. Nevertheless, dogs have occasionally been implicated in transmission of Bartonella to humans through bite wounds or scratches, and to date, all Bartonella species identified in sick dogs are also pathogenic or potentially pathogenic in humans. Immunocompromised humans should preferably choose adult, well-socialized cats over kittens as pets and should be properly educated in regard to the need for flea prevention. Cats' claws should be trimmed regularly, but there is no evidence that declawing prevents transmission. Animal scratches or bites should be avoided, and if they occur, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water, after which prompt medical attention should be sought. The Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections among HIV-Infected Persons (United States Public Health Service and Infectious Diseases Society of America) state \"No evidence indicates any benefits to cats or their owners from routine culture or serologic testing of the pet for Bartonella infection.\"78 There is also no antimicrobial drug treatment that reliably eliminates bacteremia from cats, and administration of antimicrobial drugs to cats may result in unnecessary bites, scratches, and contact with cat saliva. Pros and cons for the testing of healthy cats for Bartonella infection are shown in Box 52-2\n.67\nBOX 52-2Advantages and Disadvantages of Routine Testing of Healthy Cats for Bartonella spp. InfectionAdvantages\nCats with positive Bartonella test results can be eliminated as blood donors or breeding animalsCats with negative Bartonella test results (serology and culture or PCR) may be safer pets than cats that test positiveTesting cats for Bartonella spp. may allow veterinarians to avoid claims or litigation\nDisadvantages\n\nBartonella serology and PCR can be falsely positiveSome cats with positive serologic test results may have eliminated infection and be immune to reinfectionCats with negative test results may still be bacteremic, or become bacteremic within the near futureDetection of positive Bartonella spp. test results in some situations may lead to needless euthanasiaA focus on testing may lead to underappreciation of the need for other relevant health care such as flea controlThere is no treatment that reliably eliminates bacteremia in healthy cats, and antimicrobial drug treatment of cats has not been shown to prevent human infectionTreatment of positive cats may increase the risk of human infection due to an increased risk of bites and scratchesTreatment of positive cats may lead to unnecessary life-threatening adverse drug reactions such as esophageal strictures (doxycycline) or blindness (fluoroquinolones); it also selects for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria\n",

Since obtained as a kitten, she had shown intermittent signs of upper respiratory tract disease, characterized by sneezing, serous to mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharges, inappetence, blepharospasm, tachypnea, and a cough, for which she had been treated with amoxicillin or doxycycline on at least three separate occasions. Between episodes she appeared healthy, but she had always been thin. There had been no vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in thirst or urination. Pesto was obtained as a stray kitten, tested negative for FeLV and FIV, and had been housed indoors ever since. She was neutered at 8 months of age without complication. Five months earlier, she traveled briefly to Oregon with the owner. She lived with a dog and a retrovirus-negative kitten that was introduced 5 months ago. One other sibling had died of FIP, which was confirmed on necropsy. Pesto was up to date on vaccinations for respiratory viruses, panleukopenia virus, and rabies. She was not receiving any medications.Physical ExaminationBody Weight2.9 kg.GeneralQuiet, alert, responsive, and hydrated. T = 103\u00b0F (39.5\u00b0C), HR = 240 beats/min, RR = 40 breaths/minute, moist and pink mucous membranes, CRT <2 s.IntegumentNo ectoparasites were noted. The haircoat was full and lustrous.Eyes, Ears, Nose, and ThroatIn the left eye, mild conjunctivitis with moderate serous ocular discharge was present. Mild corneal opacity was present in the right eye. No abnormalities detected on examination of the oral cavity. There was no evidence of nasal discharge or abnormal nasal airflow.MusculoskeletalBody condition score 4.5/9, ambulatory, adequate muscle mass.All Other SystemsNo clinically significant abnormalities were detected. A full neurologic examination was not performed.Ophthalmologic ExaminationPesto behaved as if visual and was relatively comfortable with mild blepharospasm. The menace response, palpebral reflexes, and pupillary light reflexes were normal. There was no evidence of eyelid abnormalities or episcleral or conjunctival injection. Mild chemosis was present bilaterally. There was no aqueous flare, the lenses were normal, and a fundic examination was normal. The dorsal third of the right cornea had superficial vessels that extended from the limbus and a 2- to 3-mm central area where ghost vessels were present, which may have represented a previous dendritic ulcer. A rose Bengal stain was negative for ulceration.Laboratory FindingsCBCHCT 31% (30%-50%)MCV 37.8 fL (42-53 fL)MCHC 34.2 g/dL (30-33.5 g/dL)Reticulocytes 29,000 cells/\u00b5L (7000-60,000 cells/\u00b5L)WBC 7030 cells/\u00b5L (4500-14,000 cells/\u00b5L)Neutrophils 4570 cells/\u00b5L (2000-9000 cells/\u00b5L)Lymphocytes 2179 cells/\u00b5L (1000-7000 cells/\u00b5L)Monocytes 141 cells/\u00b5L (50-600 cells/\u00b5L)Eosinophils 70 cells/\u00b5L (150-1100 cells/\u00b5L)Basophils 70 cells/\u00b5L (0-50 cells/\u00b5L)Platelets clumped but adequate.

Hepatic and sublumbar nodes were enlarged to a lesser degree. The echotexture of the enlarged nodes was homogeneous. The left adrenal gland was moderately enlarged, measuring 0.66 cm in thickness. The right adrenal gland could not be differentiated from multiple enlarged nodes. No free fluid was identified.Microbiologic TestingIn-clinic FeLV antigen and FIV antibody ELISA assay: Negative.Feline coronavirus serum antibody IFA assay: Positive at 1:25,600.TreatmentPesto was treated with l-lysine (500 mg PO q12h), for possible FHV-1 infection, and doxycycline (10 mg/kg PO q24h, immediately followed by a bolus of water), for possible chlamydiosis or mycoplasmosis. The owner could not administer the l-lysine, only the doxycycline, and reported improvement in Pesto's activity level and appetite several days after starting the doxycycline.Additional Diagnostics and OutcomePesto was evaluated again 2 weeks later for possible lymph node aspiration or biopsy under sedation. Abdominal ultrasound showed persistent abdominal lymphadenomegaly. Cytologic examination of an ultrasound-guided aspirate of a mesenteric lymph node revealed mild to moderate lymphoid reactivity. Plasma cells were increased in number and were admixed throughout the specimen with rare mast cells and eosinophils. Low numbers of vacuolated macrophages and nondegenerate neutrophils were also observed. RT-PCR for feline coronavirus RNA on the lymph node aspirate was negative. IFA serology for antibodies to B. clarridgeiae was negative, whereas serology for antibodies to B. henselae was positive at 1:64. B. henselae was cultured from the blood. Treatment was changed from doxycycline to azithromycin, and again there was mild improvement in Pesto's attitude. However, several days later the cat became lethargic again, and her appetite decreased further. After 3 weeks of treatment with azithromycin, Pesto was reexamined. Because of the cat's fractious temperament, sedation was required. No abnormalities were detected on physical examination. A CBC showed a hematocrit of 23%, MCV of 39.2 fL, MCHC of 32.6 g/dL, reticulocyte count of 23,200 cells/\u00b5L, 8220 slightly toxic neutrophils/\u00b5L, 788 band neutrophils/\u00b5L, 1239 lymphocytes/\u00b5L, 788 eosinophils/\u00b5L, and 298,000 platelets/\u00b5L. A biochemistry panel showed similar abnormalities to those previously present (mild hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hyperglycemia and low creatinine), and the globulin had increased to 12.4 mg/dL, with a total protein of 14.4 mg/dL. IFA serology and culture for Bartonella were repeated and showed a titer of 1:1024 to B. clarridgeiae and 1:4096 to B. henselae; Bartonella spp. culture was negative. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of an enlarged mesenteric lymph node was obtained. Histopathology showed a mixed, dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Some of the macrophages present stained positive using immunohistochemistry for feline coronavirus antigen. Treatment with prednisone (1 mg/kg PO q12h for 5 days, then 1 mg/kg PO q24h thereafter) was initiated. Four days later, the cat became anorectic and tachypneic and was euthanized. A necropsy was not performed.\nDiagnosisFeline infectious peritonitis and concurrent B. henselae bacteremiaComments\nBartonella infection in this cat was initially suspected because of fever and lymphadenopathy, and infection with B. henselae was confirmed with Bartonella culture. Ultimately, an alternate diagnosis (FIP) was made based on the presence of the combination of marked hyperglobulinemia, a very high feline coronavirus titer, and histopathology of a mesenteric lymph node and IHC for coronavirus antigen. There was also minimal response to antimicrobial drugs with activity against Bartonella. Thus, the Bartonella bacteremia was an incidental finding. Bartonella bacteremia was detected in the face of doxycycline treatment, which highlights the fact that antimicrobial drug treatment does not always clear bacteremia. The cat was fractious and the owner could not effectively administer the l-lysine twice daily, but assured the veterinarian that Pesto had received the doxycycline. The owner may have been exposed to Bartonella during treatment. Treatment with azithromycin was followed by a single negative culture, but antibody titers increased, so the Bartonella infection may have been relatively recent.\n",
