            "text": "Influenza A community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized adults [1, 2]. In winter months, other non-influenza viral influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) cocirculate with influenza strains [2]. In January 2015, influenza A (H3N2) cases reached epidemic proportions, as did non-influenza viral ILIs. In hospitalized adults, the clinical problem is to rapidly differentiate influenza A from ILI mimics of influenza A, e.g., human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) and Legionnaire\u2019s disease (LD) [3\u20135]. Accurate diagnosis of influenza A is necessary to determine appropriate infection control (IC) precautions, as well as early initiation of anti-influenza therapy [1, 2]. The diagnosis of influenza A in hospitalized adults is usually either by rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) or by viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. RIDTs are commonly used because of their rapidity, simplicity, and low cost, but false-negatives are problematic [6, 7]. There are few false-positives with RIDTs, but frequent false-negatives [6\u20139]. ILIs with negative RIDTs should be retested by viral PCR [10]. In adults, viral ILIs are most often due to human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses (COR), rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (R/E), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [10, 11]. To definitively diagnose non-influenza viral ILIs, viral respiratory PCR is ideal, but requires more time than RIDTs, is expensive, and not available everywhere [10]. When testing demands are exceeded during epidemics, non-specific laboratory findings have been used as surrogate influenza markers, pending definitive PCR diagnosis [12\u201315].",

In addition, L:M ratios <2 have been used as an indicator of influenza A [21, 23]. L:M ratios have the advantage of being readily and rapidly available. There are no longitudinal data on L:M ratios in non-influenza viral ILIs in hospitalized adults during influenza A (H3N2) epidemics. Published data from young healthy volunteers after viral challenge indicated that R/E and RSV L:M ratios were expectedly >2 [23]. However, there are no data on L:M ratios on hospitalized adults with naturally acquired hMPV or HPIV-3 infections. In reviewing our experience with hospitalized adults during the 2015 influenza epidemic at our hospital, we were able to analyze 37 ILI patients diagnosed by PCR. The L:M ratios of non-influenza viral ILIs depended on viral type. L:M ratios >2 were present with ILIs due to R/E, RSV, and hMPV. In contrast, HPIV-3 patients had L:M ratios <2, mimicking influenza A (H3N2). Interestingly, L:M ratios in HPIV-3 patients were present on admission and persisted for >3 hospital days.",

In patients with non-influenza viral ILIs, with the exception of HPIV-3, L:M ratios <2 may be used to differentiate viral ILIs from influenza A (H3N2). Patients with HPIV-3 had L:M ratios <2 on admission and persisted for >3 days into hospitalization. L:M ratios may be useful not only in differentiating influenza from ILI viruses, but may also have important infection control and therapeutic implications, i.e., oseltamivir therapy for those ILIs with L:M ratios <2. We conclude that HPIV-3 mimics influenza A (H3N2) in hospitalized adults with relative lymphopenia, monocytosis, and L:M ratios <2 [14, 15]. Unlike influenza A (H3N2) or other respiratory viral ILIs, HPIV-3 L:M ratios persisted for >3 days into hospitalization. Clinicians should be aware that, in hospitalized adults, HPIV-3, among viral ILIs, is most likely to mimic influenza, with L:M ratios <2 [5, 11, 17, 24, 25]. Based on our experience, L:M ratios <2 should not be used to differentiate influenza A (H3N2) from HPIV-3 in hospitalized adults.",
