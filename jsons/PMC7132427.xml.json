            "text": "Positive-strand RNA viruses account for over one-third of all virus genera (van Regenmortel et al., 2000), and include significant human, animal and plant pathogens, e.g. the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and tobacco mosaic virus. Upon infection of a cell, the genomic RNA is first translated to produce viral proteins, including the nonstructural proteins involved in replication of the viral genome. Viral replication requires the assembly of replication complexes \u2013 intricate \u201cfactories\u201d featuring the close association of both viral and host components in virus-induced intracellular membrane compartments (reviewed in Buck, 1996, Ahlquist et al., 2003, Salonen et al., 2005, Sanfa\u00e7on, 2005, Nagy and Pogany, 2006). Successful assembly of such replication complexes is likely to depend on many critical interactions between viral RNA, proteins and lipids. Within these complexes, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays a pivotal role, catalyzing synthesis of new viral RNA genomes from the original infecting RNA in a two-stage process: the incoming positive-strand RNA is first used as a template to generate a complementary (negative-strand) RNA, which in turn directs the synthesis of progeny positive-strand RNAs. As a general rule, a large excess of positive- over negative-strands is produced, but the molecular mechanisms regulating this observed asymmetry and its temporal control remain largely unknown (Buck, 1996; Ahlquist et al., 2003). The fact that positive-strand RNA virus genomes can serve as templates for both translation and replication also suggests a need to coordinate their use during the viral multiplication cycle. While significant progress has been made in deciphering the molecular mechanisms of the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses, crucial details of many important regulatory steps remain to be elucidated.",

            "text": "The formation of multi-protein complexes requires specific interactions between the individual components. The first evidence suggesting that phosphorylation might regulate interactions between viral proteins within the viral replication complex came from studies performed on Dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2), a member of the family Flaviviridae (Kapoor et al., 1995). The NS5 protein, which harbors motifs indicative of RdRp activity, was shown to be phosphorylated on serine residues in virus-infected cells. Subcellular fractionation and phosphatase treatments revealed the existence of multiple forms of NS5 due to different extents of phosphorylation, with the hyperphosphorylated form being located predominantly in the nucleus. Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the replication protein NS3 \u2013 which contains proteinase and RNA helicase domains \u2013 interacted preferentially with the hypophosphorylated cytoplasmic form of NS5, suggesting that differential phosphorylation might regulate the interaction between NS3 and NS5, and thus their participation as components of viral RNA replication complexes. Subsequently, yeast two-hybrid experiments revealed that the same region of NS5 interacted both with NS3 and with the cellular nuclear import receptor importin-beta, suggesting that NS3 and importin might compete for interaction with NS5 (Johansson et al., 2001). Kapoor et al. (1995) suggested that phosphorylation of NS5 by cellular kinase(s) could cause the disruption of the NS3\u2013NS5 complexes involved in viral replication in order to promote transport of NS5 to the nucleus to fulfill an as yet uncharacterized function, but this remains to be demonstrated.",

            "text": "Evidence for a link between phosphorylation and inhibition of an interaction between replication proteins has been established in the case of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a plant virus belonging to the family Bromoviridae (Kim et al., 2002). The 2a protein encompassing the RdRp domain was reported to be phosphorylated in infected cells at a late stage of the replication cycle and was also shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by membrane-associated host kinase(s). In vitro phosphorylation assays carried out with truncated versions of the 2a protein revealed the presence of at least three potential phosphorylation sites: one in a central region comprising the conserved RdRp catalytic core, and the other two in the N-terminal part of the protein. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the N-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for interaction with the replication protein 1a, which contains motifs indicative of RNA-capping and helicase functions (Kim et al., 2002, Suzuki et al., 2003). Interestingly, in vitro phosphorylation of CMV 2a protein (or its N-terminal region) led to inhibition of the interaction with the 1a protein, raising the possibility that the phosphorylation status of the 2a polymerase might regulate interactions between viral proteins within the replication complex. Phosphorylation of the 2a polymerase at a late stage of infection would thus prevent the formation of new 1a\u20132a protein complexes, or induce disassembly of existing complexes. It is also possible, as suggested by Kim et al. (2002), that the pool of phosphorylated 2a may have another function besides replication, such as interactions with host factors leading to virus movement or host defense responses.",

This idea is supported by recent studies on the NS5A replication protein of HCV, a member of the family Flaviviridae. NS5A is a multifunctional subunit of the replication complex, playing key roles in both viral replication and modulation of host cell physiology (reviewed in Macdonald and Harris, 2004). Two phosphorylated forms of NS5A, termed p56 and p58, can be distinguished by their electrophoretic mobility. The 56 kDa form contains unphosphorylated NS5A and basal phosphorylated forms arising from phosphorylation at residues in the centre and near the C-terminus, while the 58 kDa protein \u2013 referred to as the hyperphosphorylated form \u2013 is phosphorylated within a serine-rich central region of the protein (Kaneko et al., 1994, Tanji et al., 1995, Huang et al., 2004). Hyperphosphorylation appears to be a highly regulated process that depends on the expression of other nonstructural HCV proteins (Kaneko et al., 1994).",

Such results imply that, in this context, extensive phosphorylation of NS5A is not required for its function in viral replication, a finding consistent with the fact that a derivative of NS5A whose phosphorylation was undetectable in vivo was still able to support replication of the HCV replicon (Huang et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Interestingly, a possible molecular basis for the deleterious effects of NS5A hyperphosphorylation on viral replication was proposed by Evans et al. (2004), who observed an inverse correlation between the phosphorylation state of several NS5A variants and their capacity to interact in the yeast two-hybrid system with a host protein termed hVAP-A (for human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A). hVAP-A \u2013 an integral membrane protein involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking \u2013 has been proposed as a membrane docking site for assembly of HCV replication complexes (Tu et al., 1999, Gao et al., 2004). Strikingly, in the replicon system, NS5A mutations that impair the interaction with hVAP-A strongly reduce the efficiency of viral replication (Evans et al., 2004). Collectively, these findings support a model in which the deleterious effect of NS5A hyperphosphorylation on viral replication is due to disruption of the interaction with hVAP-A, which impairs the assembly of viral replication complexes on target membranes. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that hyperphosphorylated NS5A is found neither in affinity purified HCV replication complexes (Waris et al., 2004) nor in the detergent-resistant membrane fractions proposed to be the site of viral RNA replication (Shi et al., 2003, Gao et al., 2004).",

Another recent example is the case of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), a member of the family Tymoviridae. TYMV 66K protein, which encompasses the RdRp domain, was shown to be phosphorylated both during viral infection and when expressed in isolation, and several phosphorylated residues have been identified (H\u00e9ricourt et al., 2000, Jakubiec et al., 2006). Two phosphorylation sites are located in the N-terminal region of the protein, within a PEST sequence \u2013 a conditional signal for protein degradation (Rechsteiner and Rogers, 1996) \u2013 that is invariably identified in this region of tymovirus RdRps (H\u00e9ricourt et al., 2000). Infectivity assays revealed that mimicking phosphorylation of those residues had a detrimental effect both on the accumulation of 66K protein and on viral replication, thus it was proposed that phosphorylation of these sites may serve to regulate the accumulation level of 66K via activation of the latent PEST signal controlling the metabolic stability of the protein (Jakubiec et al., 2006). Mimicking phosphorylation would lead to increased turnover of RdRp, which would thus become a limiting component in the replication machinery, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication. A recent finding that mutation of these phosphorylation sites affects 66K stability in vivo, whereas expression of the TYMV 140K replication protein \u2013 reported to inhibit 66K phosphorylation \u2013 led to its stabilization, supports this hypothesis (Jakubiec et al., 2006, our unpublished data). These results suggest that controlling the stability of a viral replication protein may have a profound influence on the efficiency of viral replication, and highlight the role that other viral proteins may play in that regulatory process.",

The p33 protein of cucumber necrosis virus (CNV), a plant virus belonging to the family Tombusviridae, is a nonstructural replication protein involved in RNA template selection and recruitment into replication complexes. p33 was recently demonstrated to be phosphorylated within CNV replication complexes (Shapka et al., 2005). Based on in vitro assays in which synthetic peptides are phosphorylated by membrane-associated host kinase(s) and/or protein kinase C (PKC), two phosphorylation sites were mapped to residues adjacent to the RNA-binding domain (Shapka et al., 2005). Interestingly, in vitro phosphorylation by PKC of recombinant p33, or amino acid substitutions mimicking phosphorylation, both reduced the ability of p33 to bind the viral RNA in vitro, while a kinase treatment promoted release of the viral RNA from a prebound p33:RNA complex (Stork et al., 2005). These results suggest that phosphorylation of p33 can inhibit its binding to viral RNA, presumably by neutralizing a positively charged motif in the adjacent RNA-binding site. Further insight into the potential function of p33 phosphorylation during CNV replication was provided by the characterization of viral mutants bearing phosphorylation-mimicking or phosphorylation-deficient substitutions. This analysis revealed that mimicking phosphorylation strongly impaired the activity of purified replication complexes isolated from yeast \u2013 a heterologous host supporting tombusvirus replication \u2013 and also drastically inhibited the accumulation of viral products in infected yeast or plant cells (Shapka et al., 2005, Stork et al., 2005). These findings are consistent with a model in which the phosphorylation state of p33 could serve as a switch during the replication cycle, allowing the binding or release of viral RNA. As suggested by Stork et al. (2005), in addition to fine-tuning of the replication process (see below), it is possible that phosphorylation of p33 at a late stage of infection could prevent the assembly of new replication complexes, and/or promote the release of viral RNA from the existing complexes, rendering it available for other processes such as translation, encapsidation or virus movement.",

Both are phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues that map to a C-terminal hypervariable domain (LaStarza et al., 1994, Vihinen and Saarinen, 2000, Vihinen et al., 2001), and phosphorylated nsP3 was detected in cellular membrane fractions enriched for viral replication complexes (Peranen et al., 1988, Barton et al., 1991) suggesting an active role for phosphorylated nsP3 in alphavirus RNA replication. Consistent with this suggestion, SFV nsP3 deletion derivatives with reduced or undetectable phosphorylation exhibited a decreased rate of RNA synthesis at early stages of viral infection in cell culture (Vihinen et al., 2001), while reduced phosphorylation of SIN nsP3 caused by thermosensitive mutations correlated with decreased negative-strand RNA synthesis (De et al., 2003), opening the possibility that phosphorylation of nsP3 might have a regulatory function at this stage of the replication cycle. Recently, SFV nsP3 was reported to carry neurovirulence determinants (Tuittila et al., 2000), and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant displayed severely reduced pathogenicity in mice (Vihinen et al., 2001) suggesting that, in addition to a role in fine-tuning of the replication process, phosphorylation of nsP3 might also be involved in regulation of viral pathogenicity.",

In particular, phosphorylation-deficient mutants displayed a change in the ratio of sgRNAs synthesized and showed a reduced ratio in positive- versus negative-strand synthesis. This finding opens the possibility that p33 phosphorylation might be involved in fine-tuning of the viral replication process during early stages of the viral cycle. Interestingly, pathogenicity in plants was also affected, as a phosphorylation-deficient mutant exhibited delayed accumulation and milder symptoms (Shapka et al., 2005). Similarly, substitutions affecting phosphorylated residues within the genome-linked VPg protein appeared to affect both replication and pathogenicity of potato virus A, a plant virus belonging to the family Potyviridae (Puustinen et al., 2002; K. M\u00e4kinen, personal communication).",

            "text": "Phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanisms of the RNA synthesis process may also depend on the phosphorylation status of the polymerase itself, as recently reported in the case of TYMV (Jakubiec et al., 2006). Remarkably, one of the residues identified as being phosphorylated during viral infection was mapped within the conserved palm subdomain of RdRp. This subdomain harbors the polymerase catalytic site and contains the conserved sequence motifs (A\u2013E) found in all polymerases (Poch et al., 1989, Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006). The phosphorylated residue is located in the so-called motif A \u2013 predicted to be involved in nucleotide recognition and binding \u2013 at a position that is strictly or highly conserved in two out of three subgroups of RdRps (Koonin, 1991). Infectivity assays with viral mutants bearing substitutions of the phosphoacceptor residue revealed that mimicking phosphorylation abolished viral replication, while a phosphorylation-deficient mutant was infectious but displayed a drastically reduced ratio of positive- versus negative-strand synthesis (Jakubiec et al., 2006). These results are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of this residue within the palm subdomain is a dynamic process that may serve as a switch to control strand asymmetry during the replication cycle. Interestingly, the evolutionary conservation of this target residue from alphavirus to picornavirus RdRps (Koonin, 1991) suggests that it may also constitute a phosphorylation target site in other viruses. Consistently, the existence of phosphorylated residue(s) within the palm subdomain of CMV polymerase 2a and within the palm and finger subdomains of HCV polymerase NS5B have been reported (Kim et al., 2002, Kim et al., 2004), although the precise target sites remain to be identified. In the latter case, the isolation of PRK2 (protein kinase C-related kinase 2) as an interacting partner of HCV NS5B (Kim et al., 2004) supports the idea that NS5B phosphorylation can regulate HCV RNA replication. Indeed, downregulation of PRK2 expression by RNA interference was shown to inhibit NS5B phosphorylation in vivo and correlated with decreased accumulation of HCV replicon RNA, whereas overexpression of PRK2 had the opposite effect.",
