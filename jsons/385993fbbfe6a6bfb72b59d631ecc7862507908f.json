The common cold is often referred to as the most frequent illness occurring in humans: over 40% of Americans suffer from a \"cold\" each year, accounting for more lost productivity than any other illness. Pharyngitis affects almost 30 million patients annually, with over 10% of all school-aged children seeking medical care each year. Seventeen million patients a year are diagnosed with asthma, with more females than males among adult-onset patients. Whether it is the reason for our patient's visit or an incidental complaint, we are involved with the diagnosis and management of these problems.",

The accumulation of purulent material in infl amed paranasal sinuses results in a feeling of fullness and pressure in and over the involved sinuses. These symptoms are worse with posture changes, bending, or with air travel-anything that alters pressure inside the sinuses. Nasal congestion and a purulent, blood-tinged discharge, general malaise, low-grade fever, and sore throat are common. These patients will have tenderness over the involved sinuses and edematous or thickened mucosa may be noted on physical examination. These fi ndings help to differentiate sinusitis from the more common cold.",

Streptococcal pharyngitis has its greatest incidence between the ages of 5 and 18 years, but is still common in patients seen in a gynecology offi ce setting. (See Fig. 19 .2 for a decision tree for sore throats.) A sore throat, tonsillar enlargement (often with exudates), soft palate petechiae, and cervical adenopathy characterize true pharyngitis. Hoarseness and lower respiratory symptoms should be absent. Streptococcal pharyngitis usually runs a 5-7 day course, with a peak fever at 2-3 days. This time course and the presence of a moderate to high fever help to differentiate true pharyngitis from the common cold.

The diagnosis of asthma is made mainly on the basis of the recurrent clinical pattern. Allergy testing, spirometry, and chest X-ray may support or clarify the diagnosis. Unusual conditions such as recurrent pulmonary emboli and cystic fi brosis, or more common processes such as congestive heart failure and tuberculosis, must all be considered. Special attention should be paid to the nose and sinuses for evidence of chronic infection. A spirometer may be used to objectively measure the amount of air inhaled and exhaled and to determine the level of airway obstruction, though the simple bedside test of asking the patient to blow out a match held at arm's length can provide a quick assessment of forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ).",
