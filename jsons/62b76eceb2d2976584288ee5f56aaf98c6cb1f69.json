We have constructed a prototype double-cuffed ETT equipped with a supplemental port in-between the cuffs through which continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is delivered. Pressure in the intercuff space propels secretions upwards and produces 100% tracheal sealing in an in vitro model. We conducted a 24 h study to investigate the sealing effect of this ETT in 12 critically ill mechanically ventilated patients. Methylene blue, instilled through a bronchoscope on top of the proximal cuff, was used as leakage tracer. Fiberoptic visualisation of the trachea was performed 1 h and 24 h thereafter. Leakage was confirmed if blue dye was detected on the tracheal mucosa beyond the tip of the ETT. In no patient, dye passed by the cuffs during the study period. Presence of the ETT did not interfere with ventilator settings, patient mobilization, physiotherapy, and technical acts. Overall, pressures in the intercuff space remained between 10 and 15 cmH 2 O. Excessive pressure swings were swiftly corrected by the CPAP system. A double-cuffed ETT, offering \"pressurized sealing\" of the trachea, safely and effectively prevented leakage during 24 h mechanical ventilation.",

Briefly, this novel ETT is double-cuffed and equipped with a supplemental port in the space between the cuffs (Fig. 1 ). ETT and cuffs are made of polyvinylchloride. Both cuffs are cylindrical and have a high volume-low pressure design. A positive pressure, created and regulated by an external source, is continuously presented to the intercuff space (ICS) and propels secretions upwards towards the oropharynx. We previously demonstrated superiority of this ETT above currently commercialized ETTs in preventing leakage of secretions in a vertical syringe model and in an artificial trachea [4] .

Cuff pressures were permanently kept at 25 cmH 2 O by an automated digital cuff pressure manometer (VBN cuff controller, VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz am Neckar, Germany). An external device (Respironics REMstar, Phillips, Herrsching, Germany) delivered CPAP to the ICS via the port in-between cuffs. The flow generated by the CPAP source was continuously measured (Mass Flow Meter 4040, TSI, Minnesota, USA). Ventilator settings were not changed during the study. At zero flow, ICS pressure equalled the working pressure (16 cmH 2 O) of the external CPAP device. An increase in flow was associated with lower ICS pressure due to resistance at the entrance of the flow conduit into the tube. When ICS pressure exceeded working pressure, air flow reversed and left the circuit through the CPAP device. Overall, ICS pressures were maintained between 10 and 15 cmH 2 O.",

            "text": "The presence of an ETT increases susceptibility to VAP because bacteriologically contaminated secretions leak around an inflated ETT cuff [5] and/or biofilms infested with bacteria are formed inside the ETT [6] . In addition, patient disconnection from the ventilator, either accidentally or preparing extubation, or cuff deflation may cause inflow of secretions. Measures to avoid leakage and aspiration include the use of specific cuff materials (e.g., polyurethane), cuff shapes (e.g., conical), continuous automatic maintenance of cuff pressure, and ETTs equipped with a suction lumen for aspiration of subglottic secretions [7] . Silver-coated ETTs may limit bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in the lumen of the ETT [8] . Comparative trials assessing these specifically designed ETTs have shown a decreased aspiration risk, a lower VAP incidence, a decreased ventilation time and a delay in VAP onset [9] [10] [11] but no effect on duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, or hospital stay [12, 13] . A main issue is that, regardless of the type of inflow prevention incorporated in an ETT, some leakage still occurs along the cuff folds [14] . Moreover, important safety concerns remain. Subglottic suctioning may cause pharyngeal and laryngeal injury [15] and condensation in polyurethane-cuffed ETTs leads to erratic manometric cuff pressure readings [16] .",

Hwang et al. designed a double-cuffed tracheal tube similar to ours but filled the intercuff space with a water-soluble gel. Applying this interrupting gel layer prevented fluid leakage for 48 h in a benchtop model [19] . This ETT was never tested in vivo because prolonged exposure to the gel components might harm the Fig. 2 Schematic representation of evolution and interaction of airway pressure (continuous line), intercuff space (ICS) pressure (straight dotted line) and flow from the CPAP device (spherical dotted line) during controlled and spontaneous ventilation. During controlled ventilation, ICS pressure rises with peak inspiratory pressure and CPAP flow decreases. During (PEEP-supported) expiration, ICS pressure decreases and CPAP flow increases accordingly. Dur-ing spontaneous breathing (sustained by a pressure support up to 5 cmH 2 O), inspiration draws air from the ICS. The resulting decrease in ICS pressure is promptly restored by an increase in CPAP flow. Expiration produces the opposite effect. At pressure support levels above 5 cmH 2 O, pressures and CPAP flow follow the same pattern as in controlled ventilation tracheal mucosa. In a later study, the same investigators connected a pressure system to the intercuff port. Application of appropriate negative suction pressures in the intercuff space completely inhibited saline leakage past the cuffs [20] . However, cuff length of this ETT prototype was too long to allow safe clinical use.",

This allowed adequate visualisation but findings might have differed if liquids with heterogeneous visco-elastic properties or higher viscosity were used. Second, occurrence of VAP is tightly correlated with bacterial load. Methylene blue as marker of leakage does not allow quantitative evaluation of microaspiration. Other markers (e.g., pepsin or amylase) present in tracheal secretions can overcome this limitation in a clinical setting [21] . Third, the sealing efficacy of the ETT was studied for only 24 h. It remains to be proven whether complete sealing persists when patients remain longer ventilated.",
