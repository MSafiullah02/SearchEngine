In this point of view, more attention needs to be paid to the effect of\nspatiotemporal characteristics.

However, in communication networks, such as Internet and telephone network,\ntime delay of contact has no relation with the geometric distance. Thus, contact patterns\nof human activities can be divided into two categories. The first pattern is the\nheterogeneous time delay (HETD) of contact activities, which depends on the geometric\ndistance. For example, cities far from disease origins are infected later than those near\nthe origins. Thus, the time delay of a contact \u03c4ij is\nproportional to the geometric distance dij between\ntwo neighbors. Obviously, the time delay distribution of contact follows power law, which\nis consistent with the distribution of time intervals between two successive messages\narriving at a given receiver.51 The\nsecond pattern is the homogeneous time delay (HOTD), in which the distance is ignored. For\nexample, in communication networks, computer virus spreading is not restrained by the\ngeometric distance. For this reason, we set the time delay \u03c4ij of a\ncontact a constant. To compare effects of different contact patterns on epidemic\nspreading, we set the mean time delay of all contacts as a fixed value in simulations. It\nis noted that time delay \u03c4ij is\ngenerally not an integer such as 1.3. We separate its integral and decimal parts as\n1.3=1+0.3,\nand then reset the time delay \u03c4ij=1\nwith probability 1\u20130.3, while \u03c4ij=1+1\nwith probability 0.3.

We first pay attention to the case of random seed, that is,\na node selected randomly as the initial seed. Obviously, in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), new cases in HETD has the lower peak value\nnmaxHETD\u22480.006<nmaxHOTD\u22480.022,\nand the longer full prevalence time TfHETD\u2248600>TfHOTD\u2248175,\nwhere the full prevalence time Tf\nis defined as the amount of time that all nodes of the network are infected by a seed.\nMeanwhile, a upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon in HETD is very intriguing, which is\nconsistent with the results in Refs. 24, 45, and\n52. We suppose that this phenomenon might origin from the correlations between\ntime delay and network hierarchy: time delays of contacts between the high-layer nodes are\nmuch greater due to longer distance from each other. To gain insight into the effect of\nthese correlations, we employ null model where time delays are randomly exchanged between\nrandomly chosen links (RNTD), and the time delay-network hierarchy correlations are thus\ndestroyed. In Fig. 2(a),\nn(t) in RNTD displays almost the same unimodal pattern\nto that in HOTD, except for a slightly lower spreading (i.e., nmaxRNTD\u22480.020<nmaxHOTD\u22480.022).\nBy comparison, we can conclude: although the heterogenous time delay of contact activities\ncan result in slow spreading,36,37,39 the very low spreading is dominated by the time\ndelay-network hierarchy correlations. More importantly, it indicates that these\ncorrelations certainly lead to the upward cascading multi-modal phenomenon. In this\nnetwork, the outbreaks in low-layer sub-regions occur much earlier than that in high-layer\nsub-regions because low-layer nodes are much closer to each other. Even if the high-layer\nnodes are infected, outbreaks will not occur in a wider range until their child nodes are\ninfected after a long time. Therefore, the peak values at t\u22487,33,78,170,and 350\nin Fig. 2(b) correspond to the outbreaks in the 5th,\n4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st layer sub-regions, respectively.",

Correspondingly,\nthe variability in HETD is lower but several comparable peaks make the long-term prediction\nof epidemic spreading hard. Second, we investigate the effect of seeds from different layers\non epidemic spreading. For three contact patterns, the high-layer seeds make outbreaks occur\nmuch fiercer, while the low-layer seeds in HETD make outbreaks occur much earlier due to the\nsmall distance between nodes in the low-layer sub-regions. Interestingly, three contact\npatterns display distinct trends of variabilities with the different layers of seeds.
