            "text": "This paper belongs to the field of theories of the Policy process and contributes to the literature on the multiple streams approach (MSA), by investigating bricolage as an alternative type of agency in agenda-setting and policy formulation. The bricoleur frames conditions as a problem that can and must be fixed and emerges as the one who looks for a solution. For the bricoleur outcome goals, or rather, the choice of a particular outcome is less important than the process goal. Therefore, the bricoleur selects policy ideas depending on the properties they display and combines them to create the best \"fit\" to couple the streams. Bricolage relates to the organizational properties of certain actors, in this case the European Commission. Evidence comes from the case of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and its origins, created in the aftermath of the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis. I will demonstrate that the crisis did not trigger the creation of the ECDC but rather was framed as a salient issue to be resolved by the Commission. The process of policy formulation that followed resulted in a bespoke solution. As such, this paper contributes to the development of the MSA but also to the literature on ideational politics and European agencies.",

            "text": "C ross-border health crises have attracted a lot of attention among the general public in the last few years, most recently with the Ebola virus. The European Union (EU) has a long history of health crises (such as the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy or \"mad cow\" disease). Most pertinently perhaps, the creation of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is often portrayed as the functional response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis that occurred between November 2002 and July 2003 (Greer 2012; Greer and L\u00f6blov\u00e1 2016; McKee, Atun, and Coker 2008) . This perspective on the importance of the crisis in the creation of the agency is often used to explain why such a short period was spent between the European Commission drafting a proposal to create the ECDC in July 2003 and the creation in situ of the agency in May 2005. The ECDC hence looks like a mundane case of agency creation: a crisis triggered a response; this response was a new agency. This idea that the time \"has come\" for an agency to be created is a recurring theme in the official narratives of agency creation as well as in the literature on the emergence of agencies that regulate or distribute information used by regulators (Alam 2007; Maggetti 2013) . The ECDC, in particular, is charged with bringing expertise to the table, thus reducing uncertainty and allowing an evidencebased regulation of risk.",

But in the field of disease prevention and control in Europe, we can observe that some features of the ECDC were pre-existent to SARS; notably a network of epidemiological surveillance, now an integral part of the ECDC, existed since the early 1990s. Moreover, the creation of a European agency dedicated to disease control has been disputed among experts and has been a topic of disagreement between European institutions since the late 1990s. At a minimum, the creation of an agency as response to the crisis has to be put in its context of conflict and contestation of the various institutional choices aired at the time. In this paper, I challenge the conventional wisdom of agency creation as response to the crisis and open the black box of the organizational and political processes of creation dynamics. As shown by Moe (2005) , institutional emergence is a political process where power is created, distributed, and re-arranged in the form of a precise set of organizational features.",

In European Studies, the MSA has been fruitfully applied to the study of agenda-setting in the EU (Ackrill, Kay, and Zahariadis 2013; Herweg 2015; Zahariadis 2008 )-adapting a model explaining agenda-setting in the United States (Kingdon [1984] 2003).

However, in the case of the ECDC, there is no figure that emerges as a policy entrepreneur. Some ideas were championed by different actors; however, rather than one idea emerging, bits and pieces of different ideas seem to have been recombined in a proposal of the European Commission. How can organizational change be explained without a policy entrepreneur? Can the MSA be refined to present coupling the streams as something other than the result of policy-entrepreneurs? How can we explain that ideas, sometimes presented as contradictory, may be identified in the institutional features of the ECDC? This paper makes two conceptual moves. First, this paper presents a critical approach to the MSA and looks for an alternative to the policy entrepreneur. I will define a new type of agency based on the search for solving a problem rather than the advancement of a solution. Second, this paper presents a different relationship between policy ideas and the agent; as such it contributes to the development of the MSA and to the literature on the creation of European agencies.",

            "text": "Agency in the MSA is usually incarnated in the figure of the policy entrepreneur. Walker (1974, 113) defines policy entrepreneurship as the advancement of solutions that are tied closely with the maintenance of entrepreneurial needs and interests. Zahariadis (2008, 18) presents the policy entrepreneur as the proactive element of the MSA capable of developing strategies to promote her solutions. In the MSA, policy entrepreneurs are successful when their efforts for entrepreneurship lead to coupling the streams in accordance to their preferences. Policy entrepreneurship is thus defined as efforts made by the policy entrepreneur to promote solutions consistent with her needs and interest. From these definitions, I infer that the actions of the policy entrepreneur are a solution-driven process from softeningup to coupling the streams. Nevertheless, Zahariadis (2003, 73) identifies two types of coupling: \"when windows open in the politics stream, coupling is likely to be doctrinal (finding a problem to a given solution),\" and \"when policy windows open the problem stream, coupling is likely to be consequential (finding a solution to a given problem).\" While doctrinal coupling suits the traditional assumptions on the activities of the policy entrepreneur (a solution-driven process or an outcome process), consequential coupling underlines that coupling can be seen as a problem-driven process. Therefore, let us turn to the literature on the problem stream that is eloquent on the notion of focusing events and how they lead to policy windows. This notion, first introduced by Kingdon ([1984] 2003), was then adapted by Birkland (1998a; 1998b) to study the effect of accidents and natural disasters as drivers of change. In the literature, new research venues appeared recently, inspired by the financial and budgetary crisis, such as Saurugger and Terpan (2015) , refining the MSA to demonstrate that the stronger the crisis, the more important the change. While the literature informs us on drivers and scope of change, there is room for studying a type of agency in the MSA that is defined as a problem-driven process rather than a solution-driven one. I thus suggest the introduction of a new type of agency in the MSA. My argument is that coupling is not necessarily the result of the efforts of a policy entrepreneur, but rather arises out of a different type of agency: bricolage, in which the one who couples the streams combines different policy ideas to formulate a bespoke solution to a problem.",

Here enters the second theme: how does the bricoleur select these policy ideas? Why are bricoleurs drawn to some ideas rather than others? The emergence of ideas in the MSA is likened to a process of natural selection (Kingdon [1984] 2003) in which the \"survival\" of ideas is arbitrated by two criteria: value acceptability (compatibility with the values of the policy network) and technical feasibility (to what extent can the idea be translated into the real world?). These criteria are relevant to understand what ideas are at the disposal of the bricoleur and why they survived the natural selection process, but do not offer explanatory leverage on why the bricoleur selects some ideas rather than other ones. On what does the bricoleur base her judgement? I suggest two criteria that the bricoleur uses when she arbitrates different policy ideas.",

This paper proceeds as follows: after entering bricolage and how it can contribute to the enrichment of the MSA, I first draw on process tracing to present the context in each stream, up to the SARS crisis. The first stream is the policy stream. Different ideas navigate in the policy stream: how do they stand the criterion of increasing returns? Evidence comes from the debate that animated the policy community by analyzing articles in different publications of practitioners. This paper then investigates the variations in the politics stream and analyze how the respective positions of the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament (EP) have shown appetite for different solutions, how the European Commission has evolved from opponent to promotor of the creation of the ECDC and how this has affected the recombination of ideas. In order to do so, official positions of the institutions have been identified from the Official Journal of the European Union and the archives of the different institutions. The problem stream is eventually analyzed in terms of perception, also drawing from archives and speeches. The second methodological step is to demonstrate the lack of fit of the figure of the policy entrepreneur in a part that reflects on the window of opportunity and agency and on how the European Commission's framing of the SARS crisis led to coupling by bricolage. Eventually, building on the analysis of the three streams, this paper focuses on the policy formulation part of bricolage, as well as the decision-making process and delivers a review of the concept in conclusion.",

In his book The Savage Mind, first published in 1962, Levi-Strauss (1988, 12) introduced the bricoleur as one who \"addresses himself to a collection of oddments left over from human endeavours\". While Levi-Strauss looked at the concept from an anthropological point of view, the concept of bricolage resonated in different disciplines of social science. In public policy, the concept captures epistemological strategies and rationalities, under the name of Epistemological Bricolage (Freeman 2007) . The concept is identified as a self-learning process, the act of piecing together knowledge, as one \"acquires and assembles tools and material as he or she goes.\" (Freeman 2007, 486 ; see also Carstensen 2011) . Freeman is interested in understanding how knowledge is formed and thus identified dynamics of learning. However, if the concept of policy change is questioned, identifying the type of \"learning\" only gives a partial answer. The concept of bricolage in public policy needs to be refined to unlock its potential in explaining policy change.",

In his classic bricolage piece of 1962, the word is mainly used to describe some extraneous, oblique movements in ball games, as well as snooker or racing. The use of the word bricolage and bricoleur is nowadays very different. The bricoleur is one in a domestic environment such as a workshop, using whatever is at hand to perform a form of craftsmanship. Now, imagine a bricoleur trying to fix a table, running out of screws. She is deprived of a solution to the problem and needs a new solution. However, she is bounded to what is available in the workshop; she looks for alternatives and decides to use a nail instead of screw. Let us now imagine that the nail is too short for the hole of the screw. The bricoleur looks again around her and finds a chip of wood. She has an idea: by sticking the chip of food at the bottom of the hole, she can use the nail. The bricoleur has thus fixed the table but rather than using \"by the book\" solutions, she combined different solutions to make it fit to the situation. The solution is not a type of modus operandi: the bricoleur will not start using nails and wood chips instead of screws. Rather, this solution is a devious mean used to keep the process of fixing the table on going.",

The idea was also supported by \"several scientific organizations, including the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases\" (Butler 1998) . The proposal was championed by Michel Tibayrenc, Director of the Centres d'Etudes sur le Polymorphisme des Mico-organismes in Montpellier, France and suggested the creation of \"scientific board\" based on the existing US Center for Disease Control (CDC). In this perspective, the ECID would be created bearing in mind that \"health policy remaining under the sovereignty of each nation and the ECID providing complementary overall coordination\" (Tibayrenc 1998) . Rather than cooperation based on surveillance of disease, the ECID would be a more ambitious idea, as its inspiration the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), being consequential in terms of training, surveillance, and research, areas in which the Charter group had demonstrated no ambition. The proposal enriched the primeval soup but never met a strong support within the policy community. As such it remained an idea \"on the shelf\": the only member of the policy community to put efforts and time in the idea was Michel Tibayrenc, but the idea never involved efforts from the community in designing a specific plan nor bared a cost. It is interesting to note that this policy idea is a cased for policy diffusion and as such cannot be considered to present increasing returns without the policy community making efforts to translate the US model to the European context.",

The journal for medical practitioners The Lancet featured an unsigned editorial titled \"Not another European Institution\" (Lancet 1998). The Editorial recalled the accomplishments of the Charter Group, in terms of trainings or surveillance. It was followed by a stream of back and forth open letters and articles dedicated to support one idea over the other one, in different public health journals (see Butler 1998; Dove 1998; Giesecke and Weinberg 1998; MacLehose, McKee, and Weinberg 2002; Newton, Grimaud, and Weinberg, 1999; Reichhardt 1998; Tibayrenc 1998; . This debate explains how these two policy ideas survived the primeval soup. The Charter Group seems to have won the battle: as a matter of technical feasibility, the Charter group was a \"light structure\" designed for the exchange of information not the funding and hosting of research facilities that is why a \"bricks and mortar\" solution was not deemed necessary. In terms of value acceptability, this was a clash between the creation of a Europeanwide institution and the reluctance of national institutionalized experts to cede sovereignty over public health policy. More importantly, the debate revolved around how each idea had the potential to be used by policymakers. However, I will demonstrate later on that the idea of an agency had limited receptivity in the politics stream.",

In the case of the EP, this happens in a context of growing hostility towards agencification where new agencies are seen as an \"irresponsible\" development of the European Executive that endangers the balance of power between elected bodies and technocratic institutions (Lord 2011 , 912, quoting the Herman Report, European Parliament 1999 . Nevertheless, the EP has demonstrated no suspicion toward the creation of an agency dedicated to the surveillance, control, and prevention of communicable diseases and even championed the creation of an institution from the beginning (Bowis 2004) . What explains the role of the EP in championing the Agency approach rather than the Network approach? The agency idea presents technical characteristics that leave room for a greater oversight of the EP. While agencification is usually seen as a phenomenon that accentuates deparliamentarization (Lord 2011, 913) , the case of the ECDC differs from policy sectors of exclusive competences. The EP's preferences were formulated in a policy vacuum and it is then not surprising that an institution traditionally eager to secure oversight makes the choice of the most institutionalized option. Lord comes to this conclusion about the EP when the other option is a \"voluntary pattern of co-operation\" (2011, 915) . Kelemen (2014) underlines that, where the EP has influence over agency design, it tends to weight on the creation of bureaucratic structures to enhance the transparency and accountability of agencies. The EP thus favors the Agency idea because it gives the Agency a stronger value acceptability than a network approach, based on oversight considerations. The amendments of the EP have been consistently suggesting creating a center rather than a network: \"Having regard to the current shortcomings in the structures for the epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases in the Member States and, therefore, the need to establish a permanent structure at Community level\"; and suggests \"collecting information relating to epidemiological surveillance and coordinating control measures in order then to forward them to a central body: the European Centre for the Surveillance of Communicable Diseases.\" (Cabrol 1997) .",

If not relying on grand theories of integration, the assumptions have been that health policy was progressively Europeanized (B\u00f6hm and Landwehr 2013) . However, the case of disease prevention is particular in the sense that the Maastricht Treaty (art. 129) gave, for the first time, legal competences to the European Commission to complement national policies, within the limits of disease prevention, health information, and education. The Maastricht Treaty paved the way for this opportunity for the fathers of the Charter group by asking the Commission to finance their initiative. This demonstrates that this policy idea emerged thanks to the realization of a problem that was recognized in the treaties, in line with the neo-functionalist or the Europeanization assumptions presented earlier. The problem is thus perceived as a consequence of the spillover of European integration: since borders are now open and microbes know no borders, transnational cooperation is needed to tackle potential transnational health problems.",

The risk of a similar outbreak was thus what the proposal suggested to tackle: the Commission framed the SARS to show that competencies were lacking at the EU level, defining \"public health matters as an area where Community competencies should be consolidated\" (European Commission 2003a; 2003b) . The solution the European Commission was looking for was not a tool to solve the threat of the SARS outbreak; rather it was the result of considerations that the EU could be at risk.

While being a convincing explanation for agencification in general, it is limited in the case of the ECDC and not supported by evidence: the ECDC is a discreet agency. As demonstrated by the limit of its competences, the ECDC reflects the Member states' preferences more than the Commission's needs and interests in seeking reputational gains. The recombination of ideas is, however, in line with the assumption that the proposal was an \"immediate action [is] motivated more by the need to avoid higher costs rather than the need to reap more benefits\" as defined by Zahariadis in his definition of consequential coupling and search for fit (Zahariadis 2003, 72) .

This new take on agency in the MSA is a response to criticisms that underline that ambiguity of preferences clashes with the existence of a policy entrepreneur with a clear personal agenda (Zohlnh\u00f6fer and R\u00fcb 2016) . In bricolage, the agent does not have clear preferences on how to solve the problem. The micro-foundations of the bricolage are that preferences regarding solutions are secondary; the issue of problem solving is at the core of this type of agency.",

Here the process tracing showed that the Commission's choice relates to the increasing returns of the network of epidemiological surveillance and the evolving ripeness of policymakers to the idea of an agency. Our bricoleur avoided the costs of exit from the network and combined elements of the agency idea to the solution because the member states were ripe to it.",

The fact that the bricoleur is a process-oriented actor chimes with the organizational properties of the Commission, which is an actor that follows process goals to outcome goals. In the EU system, other institutions may be problem-minded rather solutionminded depending on the issues at stake -this is an open question for further empirical research. I suspect that the role of bricoleur would suit a single Member of the European Parliament (MEP) or a national delegate within a Council formation. Collectively the MEPs could become a bricoleur when the EP identifies problems that the Commission is reluctant to deal with. While the policy entrepreneur is defined by their activities rather than by means of their position, the bricoleur is a concept that rather suits policymakers until empirically proven wrong.",

Cram (1993) introduced the purposeful opportunist using a very similar empirical case: a policy field in which the EU has reduced competences but in which and there is still a form of European integration. The purposeful opportunist is different from the bricoleur, while both are empirically identified as the Commission, and both can be seen as process goal driven rather than solution goal driven. Important differences remain. Cram's purposeful opportunist is an agent that accumulates knowledge until the moment it can seize an opportunity. The bricoleur is less strategic in cumulating reservoirs of knowledge that can be mobilized when the right moment comes. Bricolage can also be put in relation to models of decision. Prima facie it may resemble muddling through (Lindblom 1959) , especially considering the importance of the concept ripeness of the politics stream. Bricolage and muddling through are, nevertheless, different. Muddling through is a collective process of partisan mutual adjustment. Bricolage takes partisan adjustments as one of the elements of the equation along with increasing returns of ideas. Moreover, these adjustments are not mutual, rather the bricoleur should be seen as one who has a precise idea of the policymakers' preferences and who is able to come up with a solution in the function of these preferences.",
