They are non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses with a circular genome of approximately 2.0 kb, and typically cause severe pig and poultry disease [5]. Their genome contains two major open-reading frames (ORFs) encoding replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, inversely arranged. Circoviruses are among the most diverse viruses in the world and have recently undergone a rapid expansion, reaching 70 species classified into genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus [6]. Circovirus have been identified as causative agents of many animal diseases, such as swine pathologies caused by porcine circoviruses, psittacine beak and feather diseases in birds, enteritis epidemics in mink and diseases in fish species [7].",

The first bat-associated cyclovirus (BatACyV) and circovirus (BatACV) were reported in 2010 [8], and in 2011 [9], in US and China, respectively. Recently, other Circovirus species were identified in bats from Asia and South America [5]. To date, there is still no evidence of Circoviruses in European bats. As bats may be natural reservoirs for a large variety of emerging viruses, it is essential to identify and characterize the currently unrecognized viruses circulating in bat populations.",

Cutaneous, oral swabs, and faecal samples were collected from 46 bats, belonging to 15 different species, from 8 different localities distributed in northern and central Sardinia, and tested for the presence of Coronavirus, Herpesvirus, Poxvirus, Papillomavirus and Circovirus [10]. Captures were performed by experts within a regular census program of Sardinian bat populations, between 2017 and 2018. All international, national and institutional guidelines for the care of sampled animals were followed. Faecal samples were non-invasively collected and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. DNA was extracted from faeces using the QiAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C. A semi-nested PCR based on degenerate primers targeting a conserved Rep sequence in Circoviruses was used to detect and amplify a fragment of about 400 bp of the Rep gene [7, 9]. PCR amplifications were performed in a 50 \u00b5l reaction mix containing 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, 0.2 \u00b5M each of Forward and Reverse primers, 1X TaqBuffer and GoTaq (Promega) DNA polymerase. PCR conditions were: 5 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 1 min at 95 \u00b0C, 1 min at 50 \u00b0C (56 \u00b0C in the second PCR), and 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by a final extension time of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. PCR products were purified using DNA Clean & Concentrator purification kit (Zymo Research), and directly sequenced in both forward and reverse directions by BMR Genomics Sequencing Service (Padova, Italy). Sequences were checked against the GenBank database using nucleotide BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).",

Reaction profile was: 3 min at 94 \u00b0C, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, with a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for another 10 min. PCR amplifications were performed in a 50 \u00b5l reaction mix as above, and Taq (Qiagen) DNA polymerase was used. The amplicon was purified with the DNA Clean & Concentrator purification kit (Zymo Research), cloned into the pCR4-TOPO Vector (ThermoFisher Scientific), and the sample was sequenced using universal M13 primers by BMR Genomics Sequencing Service (Padova, Italy). Two specific internal primers were newly designed: CircoBatF3 (5\u2032-AAACACTTCCATGTCCGGCT-3\u2032) and CircoBatF4 (5\u2032-CACTCTGTATGTTGTATTCAG -3\u2032), to obtain the complete sequence by primer-walking technique. Putative ORFs were predicted using NCBI ORF Finder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/), and the circular ssDNA genome\u2019s map was constructed with PlasMapper version 2.0 (https://wishart.biology.ualberta.ca/PlasMapper/index.html). The stem-loop structures were identified using RNAfold web server (https://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum Parsimony (MP) methods implemented in MEGA 6 [12], after testing the best fitting evolutionary model to the data. Tamura 3-parameter, discrete Gamma distribution (T92 + G), was selected as the best model to analyze data and to infer evolutionary history. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. Bootstrap support values and reliability of internal branches were calculated from 1000 replicates and are located at nodes of the tree.",

Predicted ORFs, Rep and Cap (expressing replicase and capsid proteins), were present and inversely arranged, as usual in Circoviruses (Fig. 1).

            "text": "This is the first report of BatACV in Europe, as well as the first identification of these circular ssDNA viruses in European M. schreibersii bat populations (Schreiber\u2019s bent-winged bats). This bat species, listed as Near Threatened by IUCN Red List (https://www.iucnredlist.org/), is found in southern Europe and in Sardinia, typically inhabiting caves and forested habitats, but can also be found in farm environment. Full-genome sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses clarified the evolutionary relationships of this novel virus within the Circoviridae family, clustering with other previously identified bat-associated circoviruses. Interestingly, a 58 nt polythymidine (poly-T) tract was identified in the 3\u2032 IGR of Sardinian BatACV, which was previously only found, with different nt numbers, in BatACVs from Heilongjiang province, China [7]. These authors tested and showed that poly-T tract did not play any particular role in viral replication, however, the presence of this feature might have implications in the genome post-transcriptional processes, and further research may highlight these mechanisms. As previously discussed [7], it is likely that many CVs or similar circular DNA viruses are circulating in various bat species, and novel viruses thus remain to be identified. BatACVs show an average high level of genetic diversity, as well as a wide distribution. Although it is not known whether BatACVs are associated with disease, however, they are found in a broad bat host range and, as previous works and the present study support, with a wide geographic distribution, spanning from Asia to Europe to South America. Further studies should aim to investigate the possible role of bats in the transmission of circoviruses to other animal species, including porcine or avian hosts, and highlight potential zoonoses risks. Giving the high diversity of bat circoviruses and the high variability and mutation rate of ssDNA circular genomes, it is paramount to further investigate the relationships between CVs and bats, and their relevance in pathogenesis. Future surveillance of BatACVs in Sardinian bat populations should be intensified, as M. schreibersii bats share habitat and caves with many other species (such as Myotis and Rhinolophus spp.), and as cross-species transmission also to terrestrial mammals has been reported [13].",
