Zhao et al. utilized a unique approach for producing susceptible mice that could replicate human isolates of MERS-CoV in the lungs by infecting mouse lungs with an adenovirus that constitutively expresses the full-length hDPP4 gene (Fig. 1) [37]. Transient expression of hDPP4 supported infection and replication with human strains of MERS-CoV in the lungs and indicated that this technology may be an effective rapid response platform for initial evaluation of emergent and pre-emergent viruses. However, pathology associated with a fatal MERS-CoV infection was not observed in the Ad-hDPP4 model [37], which limited the capacity to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic countermeasures.",

Knock-in of full-length hDPP4 rendered mice susceptible to human isolates of MERS-CoV at low infection doses (Fig. 1) [38\u201340]. Knock-in mice exhibited severe pulmonary pathology and increased mortality; however, widespread constitutive expression of full-length hDPP4 resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV infection and replication in extrapulmonary tissues [38\u201340]. In some studies, higher viral loads could be detected in the brain compared to the lungs [39, 40]. Mice with infections of the central nervous system (CNS ) exhibited encephalitis that corresponded with the kinetics of mortality [39]. Currently, there is no evidence to support a CNS component associated with MERS-CoV pathogenesis in humans. Attempts to restrict hDPP4 expression to epithelial cells of the lungs using constitutive tissue specific promoters (e.g., cytokeratin K18) yielded outcomes similar to those observed with SARS-CoV mouse models, wherein high levels of MERS-CoV infection/replication were detected in the brains (Fig. 1) [39].",

Pascal et al. employed Regeneron\u2019s VelociGene technology to replace sequences encoding nearly the entire mDPP4 genomic region with those encoding the exons/introns from the hDPP4 genetic region (Fig. 1) [41]. Retaining the mDPP4 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genetic elements that regulate expression maintained inherent expression profiles of full-length hDPP4 in mice [41]. Importantly, MERS-CoV infection/replication was readily detected in the lungs with little involvement of extrapulmonary tissues [41]. Infection with human isolates of MERS-CoV caused moderate respiratory pathology with mortality determined by euthanasia of mice at 20% weight loss [41]. Unfortunately, commercial restrictions limit the availability and use of this model to the broader scientific community. In addition to the concerns raised above, the first generation of mouse models was developed with the full-length hDPP4, which may alter the inherent physiological properties of the mouse.",

            "text": "The multifaceted involvement of DPP4 in maintaining immune homeostasis is of significant importance regarding susceptibility to infectious disease [57]. DPP4 exists in two forms: (1) a membrane anchored form on the surface of multiple cells types (e.g., B cells, T cells, NK cells, and epithelial cells to mention a few) and (2) a secreted form that can be identified in human serum [57]. DPP4 interacts with and modifies heterologous protein molecules involved in nociception, neuroendocrine function, metabolism, cardiovascular function, immune regulation, and infection [57]. Modification of heterologous protein function can proceed through cleavage of N-terminal amino acids through the enzymatic activity of the \u03b1/b-hydroxylase domain, or allosteric interaction/signal transduction [57]. The species specificity of DPP4 is exemplified by the interaction of hDPP4 with adenosine deaminase (ADA), a well-recognized binding partner of hDPP4, which modulates downstream T cell functions [58\u201360]. The hDPP4/ADA interaction evolved in higher mammalian species (human, NHP, bovine, rabbit), but not in mouse or rat [58\u201360]. Interestingly, in one study ADA was demonstrated to block infection of MERS-CoV in tissue culture [20], indicating that the binding site on hDPP4 for ADA, and the MERS-CoV RBD, may overlap. Consequently, introducing full-length hDPP4 into mice may skew innate immune mechanisms that could influence responses to therapeutic countermeasures.",

Li et al. recently developed a mouse model wherein the mDPP4 genomic region encompassing exons 10\u201312 were replaced with the respective genomic region from hDPP4, referred to as an hDPP4 knock-in model (hDPP4-KI) [43]. Exons 10\u201312 encode contact amino acids at the hDPP4/MERS-CoV RBD interface that were able to support replication of human MERS-CoV isolates in the lungs, but did not elicit a mortality phenotype [43]. Adaptive evolution of human MERS-CoV in the hDPP4-KI mouse resulted in mouse-adapted viruses that evoked a lethal respiratory phenotype with little involvement of extrapulmonary tissues. The lethal respiratory phenotype is a consequence of novel mutations acquired during adaptive evolution. A combination of mutations in both the S1 and S2 regions of the MERS-CoV spike protein facilitated a lethal respiratory phenotype [43]. Results in the hDPP4-KI model substantiate an earlier mouse model referred to as the 288\u2013330+/+ model, which was designed with only two amino acid changes in mDPP4 to generate MERS-CoV susceptible mice.",

Initial studies in tissue culture revealed that human and rodent cell types were resistant to MERS-CoV infection upon overexpression of mDPP4; however, overexpression of hDPP4 conferred permissivity to infection/replication [53]. Comparative structural modeling of hDPP4 and mDPP4 revealed putative contact residues in mDPP4 amenable to modification at the DPP4/RBD interface. Modification of two amino acids (A288L and T330R) was sufficient to endow mDPP4 with the capacity to mediate MERS-CoV infection/replication [53]. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV into humans in 2012, the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology became available for applications to modify mammalian genomes in vitro and in vivo [61\u201363]. Recognizing our unique situation, we designed CRISPR/Cas9 targets to modify the mouse genome encoding amino acids A288 and T330 in exons 10 and 11 of the mDPP4 gene (Fig. 3) [12, 42]. Concomitant with mouse development, in vitro studies were initiated to adapt MERS-CoV to the modified mDPP4 [42]. Tissue culture adaption resulted in MERS-0 virus, which contained an RMR insertion and S885L mutation in the S2 region of the MERS-CoV spike protein [42]. A MERS-0 molecular clone exhibited enhanced replication kinetics and higher titers compared to human MERS-CoV isolates. Additionally, the MERS-0 virus replicated to higher levels in the lungs of 288\u2013330+/+ mice, compared to human and camel MERS-CoV isolates [42]. Based on these data the MERS-0 virus was used to initiate passaging in mice heterozygous for mDPP4 with A288L and T330R mutations, 288\u2013330+/\u2212 (Fig. 4). We reasoned that adaptation around one expressed copy of the mDPP4 with 288\u2013330 mutations, and a wild-type mDPP4 expressed copy, might cultivate generation of a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that could utilize wild-type mDPP4 as the primary receptor. After 15 passages we obtained a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS15c2) exhibiting a lethal respiratory phenotype in the 288\u2013330+/+ mice [42]. Our MERS-CoV reverse genetic system was used to generate an infectious clone of the mouse-adapted virus, icMERSma1 [42]. Lethal respiratory pathology with icMERSma1 required high infectious doses (5 \u00d7 106 Pfu). An additional 20 passages of icMERSma1 in 288\u2013330+/\u2212 mice bore a novel mouse-adapted MERS-CoV that produced lethal respiratory disease at doses of 5 \u00d7 105 Pfu, and lung pathology associated with severe respiratory disease at 5 \u00d7 104 to 5 \u00d7 105 Pfu [44] (Fig. 1). This MERS-CoV model system (288\u2013330+/+ mice and mouse-adapted MERS-CoV viruses) is now being employed to: (1) understand complex virus-host interactions [12, 31, 42, 64\u201367], (2) evaluate antibody-based therapeutics [42], (3) evaluate drug-based therapeutic countermeasures [68], and (4) evaluate anti-MERS-CoV vaccines [42, 66]. The goal of this chapter is to provide an outline of how to rationally design a mouse with altered susceptibility to MERS-CoV. For additional information there are a number of detailed reviews and book chapters describing the design and utilization of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for generating mouse models [69, 70].",

Notably, the 288\u2013330+/+ mice were initially generated in the Animal Models Core facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The extensive technical expertise required for genetic engineering of mice is the subject of many expert reviews and book chapters that will not be covered here. Nevertheless, we provide a conceptual overview of the steps to generate the 288\u2013330+/+ mice.Design guide RNAs to target each of the A288 and T330 alleles. Cockrell et al. designed the guide RNAs to direct the Cas9 to cut as near the mutation site as possible (Fig. 3) (see\nNote 7 for helpful resources to design and genetically engineer mouse knockouts).Test guide RNAs in vitro for the capacity to cut a target sequence (Fig. 3).Generate double-stranded ODNs or a plasmid containing the target sequence with the correct PAM site.Assemble ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (see\nNote 8).Subject double-stranded DNA with target sequence to RNP complexes and assess digestion pattern on an agarose gel (Fig. 3).Two separate oligos are also designed to introduce the novel mutations on exons 10 (A288L ) and 11 (T330R) of mDPP4, through homology-directed repair (Fig. 3).Fertilized zygotes are collected from C57BL/6J female mice that were superovulated and mated to male C57BL/6J mice.In vitro transcribed RNAs encoding the guide sequences and Cas9 endonuclease, combined with ODNs encoding the replacement alleles for 288 and 330 in mDPP4, were all pronuclear injected into the fertilized zygote [42] (Fig. 3). The fertilized zygotes were from C57BL/6J mice.The injected embryos were implanted into pseudopregnant recipient females.Newly born pups were screened for the presence of the correct change at the 288 and 330 alleles by standard PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 3) (see\nNote 9).Mice identified to have both mutations were crossed with wild-type C57BL/6J mice to obtain heterozygous mice with the mutated 288 L and 330R alleles in cis.The F1 heterozygous mice were intercrossed to generate homozygous breeders to develop the 288\u2013330+/+ colony, and for utilization in subsequent experiments.The mouse colony is maintained under conditions delineated by the institutional Department of Comparative Medicine (DCM) and Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC).",

Holding the animal vertically, apply 50 \u03bcL of virus solution by pipetting onto their nostrils and allow them to inhale. To ensure that all of the 50 \u03bcL reach the lower respiratory tract hold the mouse upright for an additional 30 s (see\nNote 12).Note any inconsistencies during infection, including: (1) presence of bubbles of inoculum from nasal cavity, (2) occurrence of inoculum in mouth, or (3) failure to inhale entire dose of inoculum. Notes will help to explain potential inconsistencies in readout parameters and may be used as exclusion criteria for inefficient infections.Mice are put back into the cage and placed on their back to ensure virus solution will stay in the lungs.

A study by Menachery et al. comprehensively describes the application of plethysmography to infectious respiratory viruses in mouse models [73] (see\nNote 17).A variety of lung function-related parameters are then recorded over a period of 5 min [e.g., enhanced pause (PenH), mid-tidal expiratory flow (EF50), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and peak inspiratory flow (PIF)].Respiratory function can be performed every day over the entire course of infection, or on single selected days. Investigating a novel respiratory virus may require the investigator to perform a time course to determine the most effective time points for measurement. The largest differences between groups typically correlate with peak viral replication.At each time point measured the mice need to be randomized into different chambers to avoid technical artifacts (e.g., a mouse measured at day 1 in chamber 1 should be evaluated in a different chamber on day 2 measurement). Practical considerations dictate that 8\u201312 animals can be measured at any one time, and each group of 8\u201312 mice may take an hour for a proficient technician. Therefore, experiments should be carefully planned to limit the number of mice to be evaluated.Mice that are difficult to handle can be slightly anesthetized by applying isoflurane to the chamber in order to remove them from the chamber and return to their cage (see\nNote 18).\n",

Nonetheless, Cockrell et al. chose to initiate their MERS-CoV adaptation studies on tissue culture cells while the 288\u2013330+/+ mice were in the process of being generated [42]. Therefore, for the purposes of this chapter this is included as a potential starting point for MERS-CoV adaptation.Cockrell et al. initiated adaptation experiments with a rMERS-CoV expressing the tomato red protein in place of the Orf5 ORF [42, 71, 72].This can also be achieved using a readily transfectable human embryonic fibroblast cell line such as HEK 293T cells and selecting for stably transfected cells.Cells can be counted by seeding an extra well, but it is safe to assume that the cell number is approximately doubled after 24 h.This can also be achieved using a microscope to assess plaque size if plaques can be readily detected.Since the major determinant of MERS-CoV tropism is the spike protein, it would be anticipated that mutations having the most significant impact on infection might occur within the gene encoding the spike protein. Nonetheless, as described by Cockrell et al., Douglas et al., and Li et al., a number of mouse-adapted mutations were identified in genetic regions outside of the spike gene, which may have a significant influence on virus fidelity and evasion of host immune responses [42\u201344].At the time that these mice were being generated in early 2014, CRISPR/Cas9 reagents were not readily available. Additionally, there were few bioinformatics tools available to facilitate guide RNA design and off-target potential. In the current research environment CRISPR/Cas9 reagents can be sourced from multiple commercial entities and there are a number of bioinformatics tools to assist with design. Addgene is a nonprofit plasmid repository where CRISPR reagents and resources can be readily obtained (https://www.addgene.org/). Additional guidance for generating mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be found in more comprehensive protocols [69, 70].All relevant reagents and protocols can now be obtained from commercial sources as readily synthesized RNAs and purified proteins (e.g., Integrated DNA Technologies).Although a number of pups may be identified to have the correct mutation, many will likely be mosaic for random mutations including insertions/deletions due to the higher efficiency of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) after Cas9 digestion compared to the desired HDR employed to mediate allele modification.The administered dose will depend on the weight of the animal which should be predetermined the day prior to initiating the experiment.It is not necessary to anesthetize mice for measuring daily weights.It is important that the inoculum reaches the lower respiratory tract for a successful MERS-CoV infection.Mouse adaptation can be initiated with any MERS-CoV strain that exhibits some pulmonary replication.Mice should never come into contact with the isoflurane. To prevent direct contact, a layer of aluminum foil is placed at the bottom of the jar and this is covered with two additional layers of paper towel.The percent body weight is typically calculated after leaving the BSL3 environment. Therefore, the weight sheets should have the anticipated weights of each animal at 20% weight loss. This will provide a real-time indication of when the mice are approaching the criteria established for humane euthanasia.Institutional approval is required for animals to be placed under exception. It cannot be emphasized enough that all animal work should be pre-approved by appropriate University IACUC and IBC committees and should be in accordance with the recommendations for the care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare at NIH.Assessing respiratory function using plethysmography under BSL3 conditions requires costly equipment and extensive training prior to use.Anesthesia should be avoided prior to measuring lung function to prevent interference with lung function measurements.\n",

(a) In vitro validation of guide RNAs via Cas9 endonuclease assay (image was kindly provided by Dale Cowley in the Animal Models Core Facility at the University of North Carolina). Agarose gel separation based on size allows for discrimination between target DNA, Cas9 digested targets, and guide RNAs. (b) Schematic utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 technology to genetically engineer mice. Fertilized C57BL/6 J zygotes are collected and injected with RNA encoding Cas9, DPP4 single guide RNA, and oligos to facilitate homology-directed repair (HDR). Microinjected zygotes are implanted into pseudopregnant recipient female C57BL/6 J mice. Offspring are screened by sequencing for the intended change at positions 288 and 330. Mice identified as having the appropriate changes are backcrossed to C57BL/6 J mice to maintain the pure C57BL/6 J background, or may be crossed to any desired strain (e.g., BALB/cJ or 129S1/SvImJ). (c) Table describing sequences of Cas9 guide RNAs and oligos for HDR to genetically engineer amino acid changes at position 288 (Ala to Leu) and 330 (Thr to Arg). (d) Sequencing chromatograms highlighting how the F0 offspring from embryo implantation can be a mosaic of insertion/deletions (InDel\u2019s) generated by random non-homologous end joining from Cas9 cutting at the genomic alleles, and the HDR repair that incorporates the intended changes encoding amino acids at positions 288 and 330. Pure homozygous 288\u2013330+/+ lines were obtained by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 J mice. The highlighted mutations CAA (TTG in the reverse orientation) and AGA encode the novel 288 L and 330R amino acids",
