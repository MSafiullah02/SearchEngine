And, though only briefly discussed in this chapter, the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention center (the Center) in Wan Chai and Golden Bauhinia Square (the Square) attached to it on Victoria Harbor have special political significance (Clarke 2007) as well as serves as sites of protest as they are seen by some subalterns emblematic of the Hong Kong SAR (HKSAR) instead of Hong Kong. The Center is where the ceremonies for Hong Kong's return to China were held in 1997 and its chief executives are sworn in to office by China. The Square is also the location of the SAR formal flag rising and SAR Day celebrations on the first of each July. China's national holidays are also celebrated at the Square with flag raising ceremonies. A variety of large government forums related to Hong Kong's relationship to the mainland are also hosted at the Center by senior Chinese government officials and senior leaders. In 2012 it was the location of days-long major protests over the installation of the new chief executive by China's President Hu Jintao. As an iconic resource of the local and national hegemons, this space during the special days and events becomes \"activated\" in the political rhetoric of \"one country, two systems\" and has an increased subaltern interest as a counter-hegemonic site of visual contention and disruption. Situated at a short distance from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) barracks and the new central government offices in admiralty, the area will probably increase in importance as a protest site in the future given the growing contestations between Hongkongers and their local and central governments. Sites of relevance in Hong Kong's Central District include, Charter Garden, Statute Square, the former Legislative Council (LegCo) Building, and the former central government offices (both, as of late 2011, have been moved to new locations at Tamar in Admiralty). Similar to Causeway Bay, Charter Garden Road, adjacent to an urban park, is a frequent staging point for marches to either the central government offices or China's Liaison Office in Western.",

Since 2008, the complex has been the target of disputes over its use of public space for commercial purposes (Chui 2008; Lee 2008) . In 2010, for instance, a pre-June 4th rally in the Times Square piazza featured a large replica of the Goddess of Democracy that was subsequently confiscated by the Hong Kong police; reportedly over to \"safety\" concerns raised by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department 2 . Activists arrested in the incident were prosecuted and found guilty under a Places of Public Entertainment Ordinance because they did not have a license to display the statue; this was the first time ever that the Ordinance had been used to squelch political speech. (Chiu 2011a) The statute had been displayed in prior years without incident. (LegCo 2010, p 10662) According to media accounts, the Times Square management had refused to allow the exhibition claiming, \"We rejected the application because we wanted to keep the place politically neutral so we did not want any political activities taking place there.\" (Chiu 2011b ) The manager's statement is a bit ironic in that the SAR Government has hosted a number of exhibits there that conceptually fall under the category of national/patriotic education which is an inherently political and controversial issue in the SAR-as was vividly demonstrated in 2012 by the months-long anti-Moral and National Education (MNE) movement. Further incidents regarding the public display of the Goddess of Democracy at several Hong Kong universities transpired shortly thereafter including one institution that announced \"a ban on the permanent display\" of the statue (Ching 2010) . The incident was subsequently cited in Amnesty International's 2011 annual China report under freedom of expression, association, and assembly incidents (Amnesty International 2011). The Government's efforts in confiscating the replica and attempting to justify its actions were said to have led to a boost in attendance at that year's candlelight vigil (Chueng and Fung 2010) (Figs. 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 and 4.18) .

Though the park is frequently mentioned in news reports and books as the site of Hong Kong's two major political rituals and its political importance 3 has been long noted, scholarship on Victoria Park and its larger importance within the political space of the SAR and as a site of resistance is scant (Chiu and Lui 2000; Clarke 2007 ). Typically, passing references to the urban green space are background for other sociological phenomena such as convergence of, and usage by, thousands of foreign domestic workers (FDW) in Hong Kong (Koh 2007) . In fact, emerging evidence appears to suggest that the HKSAR Government specifically wants to avoid the association of the park with \"protests\", even when they are not oriented toward demands for democracy or criticism of the People's Republic of China (PRC). For instance, the director of Hong Kong's Pride Parade claimed the SAR Government's Leisure and Cultural Services Department which oversees the SAR's urban parks reportedly \"told her the application [to use the park to host the LGBT event] was rejected because it did not want the park to be known as a meeting point for parades or protests\" (Cheng 2011) . Such an attempt to \"disappear\" or render \"invisible\" cultural, social, and political significance of Victoria Park as a space of subaltern resistance toward the local and central governments is not unprecedented and implicitly invokes the culture and politics of disappearance described by Abbas (1997) .",

This structure was built on land reclaimed from the harbor for the purpose, and the handover ceremony was the very first occasion the building was used. Consequently it was possible for the beginning of the post-colonial era in Hong Kong to be marked at a site with no colonial associations, \u2026 All memory was deliberately absent in this site, enabling it to function as a locus for forward-looking national meanings that had no previous point of purchase in Hong Kong space\" (Clarke 2007, p 361) . Clarke also argues, with good reason, that Victoria Park maybe \"the most important site for a politics of memory in Hong Kong\" due to its hosting of the annual 4 June candlelight vigils remembering the fallen in Tiananmen. It is, he writes, \"a site for remembrance of one of the most difficult and contested events of recent Chinese history\" (Clarke 2007, p 364) .",

The sidewalk seethes with residents and tourists and the one-way car lane in front of the exit heading towards Victoria Park turns into a pedestrian thoroughfare ringed with Hong Kong's mainstream and radical pan-democratic political parties fund raising: selling bags, political magazines, t-shirts, stickers, pins, and distributing flyers mostly filled with calls for the Chinese Communist Party to revisit its declaration that the student protestors were leading a counter-revolutionary movement. Mixed with these demands is a cornucopia of local political and social justice issues. One party offers T-shirts depicting the chief executive elect as a sly wolf; others have a huge proletarian worker crushing Hong Kong's tycoons and colluding government officials for bleeding the residents dry; the Tiananmen Mothers and the 'Tank man of Tiananmen' are other iconic visuals on display.",

Dealing with sedition, subversion, secession, and treason against the communist state, the law was inserted into the Basic Law by Chinese authorities at the last minute in 1989 after a million Hongkongers supported the student movement in Beijing by taking to the streets themselves, sending aid to those protesting in the Square, and then abetting the escape of many student leaders and followers following the events of June 3rd and 4th.",

Following the SARS crisis the SAR government introduced the legislation and prepared to debate and vote on it, but was forced by the massive demonstration that shocked and unnerved the local and central governments to indefinitely table it. Since then innumerable articles, commentaries, books, and editorials have been published on the protest and its aftermath.

Some consider the turnout of the event to be an indicator of the health and strength of the local pro-democracy movement and the movement's death has been announced several times by myriad regime officials and their clients after disappointing turnouts. Conversely, when there are large or huge turnouts as there were in 2012 and 2013, the regime tends to dispute and mitigate protester counts. As such, an ascendency in use of images of massive numbers of protesters in the streets as visual claims are evident whether it be the June 4th, July 1st, October 1st, the anti-MNE, or plain old \"chief executive step-down!\" protests.",

Unlike \"riot porn\" which typically invokes the image of violence, Hongkongers-even the more radical actors-are probably more likely to adopt something akin to \"defiance porn\": images of standing up to the regime be it in front of a police riot line or sitting in the middle of vehicle intersections (traffic stoppage).

Other issues included the alleged scarcity of infant milk powder for \"Hong Kong babies\" said to be caused by mainlanders buying large quantities of formula in Hong Kong for resale on the mainland. This trade was driven in part by mainland food safety and counterfeit concerns. Anxieties regarding mainland drivers included fears of hit and run crimes by mainland drivers who might then flee to the Mainland to escape prosecution. See (Garrett 2013) and larger issues of social justice within Hong Kong like, locals' fears over the SAR Government's intention to allow Mainland drivers to drive in Hong Kong, anger over pressure on limited local maternity wards and resources from an influx of pregnant Mainlanders that precluded local women receiving care, and instances of discrimination toward Hongkongers in preference for Mainland customers by some local and international retail and luxury chains. Locals' anxieties were accentuated by an October 2011 incident in a nearby Chinese city where a small child was run over and ignored by the driver and more than 20 pedestrians who callously walked by without intervening. The level of Mainland tourist inflows, four times the entire population of Hong Kong visited in 2011 alone, and cultural clashes between them and locals were another significant factor stoking tensions (Figs. 4.22, 4.23 and 4.24).",

The protesters were reacting to Mainland Chinese authorities' proposal to replace prime time Cantonese television shows with Mandarin which is the official language of the PRC (Yang 2010) . Related \"language\" issues involving a visual component center on some Hong Kong retailers using simplified Chinese characters (official writing style) in place of traditional (used in Hong Kong) characters. Beyond intelligibility issues, this was also seen as a \"culture war\" with some Hongkongers referring to simplified writing as writing with \"crippled Chinese.\" Within Hong Kong this touches on larger and equally sensitive issues of local identity and culture which have increasingly been under contestation as the SAR continues to be integrated and assimilated into mainland China.",

Most spectacular to date was the creation of a large mockup of a PLA warship and its subsequent destruction by environmental activists, harbor conservationists, and subaltern legislators using a sledge hammer branded \"I [heart] HK.\" Photographs of the preparation of the ship and the actual demolition of the vessel were shared over Facebook and other social media to enhance the visuality of the event and the nascent \"Save Central\" movement. Notably, the activist artist, Kacey Wong, responsible for creating the ship and the \"image event\" has been involved in several other high-profile \"political art interventions\" during recent July 1st marches. (See Chap. 6) Located in the Western District of Hong Kong Island, the Liaison Office is situated a bit out of the way from the normal hustle and bustle of Hong Kong daily and tourist life. Unlike the SAR Government offices, it is not located close to the MTR but it is near Hong Kong's tram and numerous bus lines. Furthermore, the open space for holding protests infront of the office is very limited with busy roadways in front and behind the building and other skyscrapers located on either side of it. As during most demonstrations in Hong Kong, there is normally a very heavy police presence. That said, demonstrators in a 2010 New Year protest at the Liaison Office did try to force their way into the building. In general, 2010 marked the beginning of a period of increasingly confrontational exchanges between police and local prodemocracy supporters and of increasing willingness of the latter to directly target Beijing's icons of power in the SAR rather than simply content themselves with demonstrating against China's clients in Hong Kong. To date in 2012, large protests targeting the Liaison Office seem to become the norm as demonstrated by events in June and July.",

All of which were easily visible to pedestrians, and trams and vehicular traffic. The demonstrators' \"occupation city\" consisted of bookshelves, couches, desks, sleeping bags, tents, and even a small kitchen. According to press accounts, about 50 protesters lived in the camp at the peak of the movement. Following the trend of other major cities evicting \"occupy\" settlements from public urban spaces, HSBC took legal action in June 2012 to begin the removal of the camp, claiming that it needed the public area for fund raising and other events, and that the occupation had been a nuisance to its customers and had forced the bank to incur security expenses because of the protesters; they also accused the movement of attempting to monopolize the public space (Cheung 2012 ",

As one historian put it: \"Few other sites in this city of over 7 million people carry as much colonial 'baggage' as this one\" (Le Pichon 2009). Statute Square was, during colonial times, situated at the heart of the colonial power elite: \"Influence in Hong Kong was wielded around Statue Square. In order to exercise it and to perform the necessities and duties of their professional lives, all they had to do was to cross Statue Square in one direction or the other and to find in its various buildings all that they could possibly wish for-good food, good wines, good legal advice, good bank loans, and, in the evening, at the City Hall, good performances of Gilbert and Sullivan\"(Le Pichon 2009).",
