Translational control can be global, regulating expression of most transcripts, or transcript\u2010selective, modulating a defined subset of mRNAs.3, 4, 5 Transcript\u2010selective regulation is generally mediated by proteins or complexes binding to specific elements in the 5\u2032\u2010 or 3\u2032\u2010untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs.6, 7, 8 Such coordinate, posttranscriptional control of expression of functionally related genes has been termed as \u2018posttranscriptional regulon.\u20199, 10 We have described a 3\u2032\u2010UTR\u2010specific, transcript\u2010selective translational control mechanism that regulates a group of functionally related genes.11 In human myeloid cells, the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3) induces recruitment of several abundant \u2018housekeeping\u2019 proteins for assembly of a heterotetrameric IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex (Figure 1). The human GAIT complex consists of glutamyl\u2010prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS), NS1\u2010associated protein 1 (NSAP1), ribosomal protein L13a, and glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).12 Interestingly, the heterotrimeric murine GAIT complex lacks NSAP1.13 The GAIT complex binds a defined bipartite GAIT element consisting of a 29\u2010 to 33\u2010nucleotide (nt) stem\u2010loop in the 3\u2032\u2010UTR of multiple inflammation\u2010responsive mRNAs and inhibits their translation without affecting total protein synthesis.11, 14\n",

For example, the requirement for two independent, temporally distinct signaling pathways, namely, early induction of EPRS phosphorylation and delayed induction of L13a phosphorylation.15, 18 Also, the complex is formed from proteins with canonical activities distinct from their function in the GAIT system. For example, EPRS and L13a are ubiquitous components of translation machinery required for mRNA translation, but when assembled into the GAIT complex they adapt to perform \u2018moonlighting\u2019 functions in translation repression.11 Likewise, GAPDH activity is essential for glycolysis and energy production, but it displays a noncanonical chaperone\u2010like activity in the GAIT system.19 Also remarkable is the stimulus\u2010dependent release of EPRS and L13a from their macromolecular complexes: the MSC and ribosome, respectively.12, 20 These findings introduced the concept that otherwise stable macromolecular complexes, particularly the MSC, can act as depots of stimulus\u2010dependent releasable regulatory proteins that perform specialized auxiliary functions unrelated to their primary function within the parental complex.21 Here, we review the function of the individual constituents in GAIT complex assembly and the 3\u2032\u2010UTR GAIT element\u2010bearing targets subject to translation\u2010repression, as well as the auxiliary activities of the GAIT complex proteins.

In human EPRS, the two enzymatic domains are joined by a noncatalytic linker containing three helix\u2010turn\u2010helix WHEP domains (named after the AARSs first shown to contain these domains, i.e., Trp(W)RS, His(H)RS, and EPRS).31 The N\u2010terminus of EPRS also contains an appended glutathione\u2010S\u2010transferase (GST)\u2010like domain that has an important role in MSC assembly and structure.32 EPRS along with seven other AARSs and three non\u2010AARS proteins reside in the MSC, a cytoplasmic 1.5\u2010mDa macromolecular complex.33 The MSC has been shown to bind ribosomes and is thought to improve translation efficiency by direct channeling of charged tRNAs to the ribosome A\u2010site.34, 35 Activation of EPRS during GAIT complex assembly in myeloid cells requires IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced phosphorylation of Ser886 and Ser999 in the linker region, followed by release of EPRS from the MSC.15 Free, phosphorylated EPRS binds NSAP1 and the other GAIT components to form the active translational silencing complex. Recently, EPRS has been observed to exhibit several GAIT\u2010independent, noncanonical activities related to adiposity and antiviral defense, and possibly in breast cancer progression.17, 36, 37, 38 Interestingly, EPRS is not unique among AARSs in the expression of a noncanonical function as recent studies have shown many, if not most, AARS also express secondary activities unrelated to tRNA charging.39, 40 Beyond the noncanonical function, elucidation of EPRS's mode of activation revealed an unexpected finding, namely, stimulus\u2010dependent release of EPRS from its parental complex, the MSC.12, 15 This observation, coupled with stimulus\u2010dependent release of L13a from the 60S ribosome (see below), led us to propose the \u2018depot hypothesis\u2019 in which macromolecular complexes serve as depots or reservoirs of proteins that can be released under specific conditions or stimuli to perform new functions unrelated to the primary function within the complex.20, 21\n",

Surprisingly, although EPRS is released from the MSC within a few hours following IFN\u2010\u03b3 stimulation, the interaction with the GAIT RNA element is delayed for at least 10 h.12 Interaction of NSAP1 with the downstream, overlapping pair of WHEP repeats, R2 and R3, prevents EPRS binding to target mRNAs.41 The inhibition is reversed by delayed interaction of EPRS with Ser77\u2010phosphorylated L13a and GAPDH that induces a conformational shift in the EPRS/NSAP1 complex thereby exposing the RNA binding site (Figures 2 and 4).18, 42 A proteomic screen using RBDmap to identify RNA\u2010binding proteins (RBPs) and domains identified the EPRS linker as an atypical RNA binding site.43 Each of the phospho\u2010sites in the human EPRS linker has its own protein\u2010binding function. Phosphorylation of Ser886, located in the spacer between R2 and R3, is essential for NSAP1 binding, whereas phosphorylation of Ser999, located just upstream of the PRS domain, facilitates the binding of L13a and GAPDH, completing the formation of the GAIT complex15, 41 (Figure 4).",

Normoxia and hypoxia induce distinct conformational structures in the VEGFA 3\u2032\u2010UTR driven by alternative binding of the GAIT complex and an hnRNP L\u2010containing complex, respectively.82, 99 When myeloid cells are stimulated with IFN\u2010\u03b3 under hypoxic conditions, hnRNP L is phosphorylated at Tyr359 and accumulates in the cytoplasm in a complex with hnRNP A2/B1 and DRBP76 (double\u2010stranded RBP) (Figure 6(iii)).100 The hnRNP L in the HILDA (hypoxia\u2010induced hnRNP L\u2010DRBP76\u2010hnRNP A2/B1) complex binds a CA\u2010rich element directly adjacent to the GAIT element, and DRBP76 binds a downstream AU\u2010rich stem\u2010loop thereby disrupting GAIT element formation, preventing GAIT complex binding, and enhancing VEGFA mRNA translation.

We identified the constitutive presence of low levels of a C\u2010terminus truncate of EPRS, termed EPRSN1, that contains the RNA\u2010binding domain, i.e., the upstream pair of WHEP domains, but not the downstream domain required for GAIT complex assembly.27 Thus, EPRSN1 shields a small amount of target transcripts, including VEGFA and ZIPK mRNAs, from GAIT complex\u2010mediated translation\u2010repression, thereby permitting continuous, leaky translation of the target transcripts at a very low rate that we termed a \u2018translational trickle\u2019 (Figure 6(v)). Investigation into the mechanism of EPRSN1 generation revealed an unexpected twist on alternative polyadenylation (APA). Polyadenylation normally occurs downstream of the coding region to terminate the 3\u2032\u2010UTR. APA events most often alter 3\u2032\u2010UTR lengths, but also can occur within introns to alter splicing events yielding an alternative coding region.102 We observed a cryptic polyadenylation signal within the EPRS coding sequence consisting of an UA cleavage site within an UAU codon specifying Tyr, an upstream AAUAAA polyadenylation element, and a downstream U\u2010rich element. During generation of EPRSN1, the UA cleavage site is polyadenylated to convert the UAU codon to the UAA stop codon.27 Thus, polyadenylation\u2010directed conversion of a Tyr codon to a stop codon (PAY*) results in a truncated, but translatable, transcript in which the newly generated stop codon is followed directly by a polyA tail without an intervening 3\u2032\u2010UTR. The low efficiency of EPRSN1 mRNA generation might be due to sub\u2010optimal distances between the polyadenylation elements, or possibly to interference by downstream secondary sequences or structures that interfere with the PAY* process.103, 104 Global analyses have indicated several APA events within coding regions, however, they most often generate truncated transcripts lacking a stop codon, and are subject to nonstop mRNA decay.105, 106, 107 The PAY* process discovered in EPRSN1 not only reveals a novel cellular mechanism for regulating gene expression, but it also provides a new genetic mechanism for transcriptome and proteome expansion.",

Deletion of essentially the entire Rpl13a gene, as was done in the experiments described here, might have also deleted the snoRNAs that have been shown to confer resistance to lipotoxic and oxidative stress in vitro.72 Importantly, deletion of the Rpl13a snoRNAs in a mouse model, while leaving the coding and regulatory regions intact, profoundly influenced mitochondrial metabolism, resulting in enhanced systemic glucose tolerance and protection against oxidative stress.128 In view of these potentially confounding functions of the Rpl13a gene locus and protein, the development of alternative in vivo models is required to confirm the role of the GAIT system in inflammation\u2010resolution. We have generated mice with Ser999\u2010to\u2010Ala mutation in the Eprs gene and thus defective in stimulus\u2010dependent phosphorylation required for EPRS activation and participation in the GAIT complex.17 Unexpectedly, these mice exhibit low body weight, reduced fat mass, and longer life span comparable to mice with defects in the upstream mTORC1\u2010S6K1 signaling axis that phosphorylates EPRS at Ser999. The phospho\u2010deficient mice do not exhibit an inflammatory phenotype as determined by cytokine levels in serum, but they have not yet been challenged with pro\u2010inflammatory stimuli. Phospho\u2010defective EPRS mice will be helpful for investigating GAIT system activity, however, the metabolic phenotype, and other noncanonical functions of EPRS, might confound interpretation of inflammation\u2010related parameters. Possibly, the development of phospho\u2010defective L13a mice will provide the most specific and reliable information on the role of the GAIT system in inflammatory responses.",

The human and mouse GAIT systems differ as the latter lacks NSAP1 in the GAIT complex and its phosphorylation\u2010mediated binding site in the EPRS linker.13 This species\u2010specific difference is not completely unexpected, particularly in innate immunity systems. For example, macrophages and other immune cells in the two species, often respond differently to pro\u2010inflammatory stimuli.52, 129 These species might have acquired these disparate functional differences in both orthologous and paralogous genes due to (1) divergence ~65\u201375 million years ago and (2) more importantly, dissimilar ecological niches with distinct pathogenic challenges. The targets of the GAIT complex also reveal species differences. A pattern search for Cp\u2010like GAIT elements in an UTR database suggests their presence in multiple nonhuman mammalian species, e.g., sheep and baboons, but it appears to be absent in rodent Cp mRNA.14, 82 Likewise, the same search suggests that mouse VEGFA mRNA lacks a GAIT element. However, translational repression of VEGFA mRNA is observed in both mice and humans.99 These observations suggest that the mouse and human GAIT complexes recognize different structural elements, and our ability to bioinformatically detect GAIT element is limited due to the structural diversity.",

            "text": "In the human GAIT system, the upstream pair of EPRS WHEP domains are required for binding GAIT element\u2010bearing RNA targets. The presence of WHEP domains in EPRS is conserved from unicellular filasterean animal\u2010like organisms to multicellular mammals; the sole exception is the WHEP\u2010less EPRS found in several parasitic protostomes.44 One informative example is the stinging sea anemone N. vectensis which expresses three alternatively spliced mRNAs from the EPRS gene; two mRNAs encode EPRS bearing a single WHEP domain in the linker, whereas the third encodes a form bearing two adjacent WHEP domains.45 Binding studies of expressed N. vectensis EPRS linkers revealed one of the 1\u2010WHEP isoforms bound tRNA with high affinity, but the 2\u2010WHEP isoform bound human Cp GAIT element RNA with high affinity. A third isoform with a unique single WHEP domain binds both RNA classes with intermediate affinity. One can surmise the evolutionary history of EPRS function from the unusually complex splicing pattern that generated these isoforms. Possibly, a linked EPRS bearing a single WHEP domain evolved to insure the availability of tRNA to the adjacent synthetases for increased charging efficiency. Later duplication of the WHEP domain permitted additional RNA\u2010binding characteristics such as GAIT element\u2010binding, and perhaps other regulatory RNAs. Studies to test the role of these isoforms in regulating N. vectensis gene expression have not been done. However, it is tempting to speculate that an early version of the GAIT system originated in a closely related ancestor of N. vectensis and has persisted in metazoans for hundreds of millions of years. There is no experimental evidence for the presence of GAIT function in more complex, i.e., bilaterial, metazoans other than mice and humans. The urochordate sea squirt Ciona intestinalis exhibits a structural equivalent of a GAIT element in the 3\u2032\u2010UTR of a CAP gene member of the cysteine\u2010rich secretory protein, antigen 5 and pathogenesis\u2010related 1 superfamily thought to be involved in modulation of host immune responses.130 Interestingly, formation of the GAIT is regulated, and only forms when the organism is challenged with LPS, consistent with a role in innate immunity. Genome sequencing of C. intestinalis revealed that EPRS mRNA contains two WHEP domains comparable to the RNA\u2010binding, upstream pair of WHEP domains in the human ortholog, suggesting a potential GAIT element\u2010binding activity of EPRS and GAIT\u2010mediated innate immune function.44 Finally, a GAIT\u2010like RNA sequence has been described in the 3\u2032 terminus of the transmissible Gastroenteritis coronavirus genome, with a possible function in modulating innate immunity.131\n",

Prominent among these are questions at the molecular level such as the mechanism of release of phospho\u2010EPRS and phospho\u2010L13a from their parental macromolecular complexes, and the specific role of phosphorylation in these events. Although, the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010activated proximal kinases that phosphorylate EPRS and L13a have been elucidated, our knowledge of the upstream activation pathways that coordinate early and delayed phosphorylation of EPRS and L13a, respectively, is limited. Also, the unexpected requirement of both Cdk5/p35 and S6K1 (as well as mTORC1) in EPRS phosphorylation remains unclear.16, 17, 133 The early formation of the pre\u2010GAIT complex about 12 h before formation of the functional GAIT complex remains puzzling, and its function, if it has one, is completely undefined. We also have very limited structural information about the protein\u2013protein interactions within the GAIT, HILDA and S100A8/A9\u2010iNOS complexes, and their interactions with targets.

Furthermore, the discovery of GAIT complex activation in other immune cells as well as in nonmyeloid cells by non\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b3 agonists would certainly alter our understanding of the significance of the system. Also, the identification and verification of new GAIT element\u2010bearing target mRNAs should provide additional insight. Additional genetic animal models should prove helpful. As described above, the important studies using myeloid\u2010specific, L13a\u2010deficient mice are consistent with an anti\u2010inflammatory role of the GAIT system, however, their interpretation is confounded by the other moonlighting activities of L13a, and by the presence of snoRNAs within the RPL13a gene itself.72, 73, 76, 128 Likewise, phospho\u2010deficient EPRS mice exhibit strong, potentially confounding phenotypes unrelated to inflammation.17 Possibly, a mouse with a mutation in the RPL13a gene that prevents release from the ribosome and GAIT complex formation, but still permits rRNA methylation, would be informative. A critical void is the absence of information on the role of the GAIT system in regulating inflammation and inflammatory disease in humans. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that influence GAIT complex constituents or GAIT elements in target mRNAs have not been reported. Likewise, the roles of environmental effectors of GAIT system activity such as LDLox or hypoxia have not been investigated in vivo, either in humans or in mice. The regulation and dysregulation of posttranscriptional mechanisms contributing to the resolution of inflammation is a critical, under\u2010investigated area. We believe that a deeper understanding of the \u2018off\u2010switch\u2019 provided by the GAIT system, both at the mechanistic and physiological levels, will provide new avenues and opportunities for development of novel therapies against chronic inflammatory diseases.",
