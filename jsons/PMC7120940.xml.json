For example, an early application included the introduction of over 27 mutations into the SARS-CoV genome at 9 different genome transcription regulatory sequences, thereby demonstrating for the first time that the transcription regulatory circuit of a virus could be rewired [33]. The applicability of the RGS was ratified in ensuing reports describing the cause-and-effect relationship between site-directed mutations introduced into the viral genome which altered viral fitness and in vivo pathogenesis phenotypes [17, 18, 33\u201336].",

            "text": "In a seminal pathogenesis study RGS was used to validate that six mutations acquired during mouse adaptation of the SARS-CoV Urbani (MA15 ) strain indeed caused lung pathology associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [18]. Since these mutations were dispersed across the entire genome, RGS proved to be an efficient method to introduce all six mutations simultaneously in order to generate a robust mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strain. Notably, because MA15 SARS-CoV is a novel virus strain, RGS is an effective method to validate Koch\u2019s postulates by demonstrating a cause-and-effect relationship. After nearly a decade of research the MA15 strain continues to play a dominant role in SARS-CoV mouse pathogenesis studies, including vaccine and therapeutic evaluations [7, 17, 37\u201339]. In today\u2019s research environment these studies would be considered gain-of-function (GOF ) studies, and thereby would have been subject to increased government oversight, which would have inevitably stymied progress into understanding the molecular mechanisms governing emerging coronavirus pathogenesis, host range, receptor usage, virus replication, and vaccine and therapeutic efficacy [3]. Notably, SARS-CoV gain-of-function (GOF ) studies have yielded invaluable information regarding the role of viral proteins in pathogenesis in animal models and in tissue culture studies [17, 36]. Applying the combined technologies of GOF studies with the RGS will be essential to future research on emergent and preemergent coronaviruses.",

            "text": "More recently RGS applications were extended to MERS-CoV wherein a replication-competent MERS-CoV expressing the tomato red fluorescent protein (tRFP) was rapidly generated (reproduced from [25]) (Fig. 5). The infectious clone (icMERS-CoV-tRFP) has since been applied to understanding host factors that restrict MERS-CoV infection [40, 41]. Figure 5 demonstrates how the icMERS-CoV-tRFP was used to facilitate mapping of specific amino acids in the host dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4) receptor that are necessary to permit MERS-CoV infection and replication [40]. Humanizing the mouse DPP4 by changing a minimum of two amino acids (A288L and T330R) on the mouse DPP4 protein conferred efficient infection/replication of MERS-CoV as determined by expression of tRFP from the icMERS-CoV-tRFP virus (Fig. 5) [40]. The following protocol outlines the RGS used to generate infectious clones of MERS-CoV , and provides detailed methods for building recombinant coronaviruses using this technique.\n",

UV will introduce random mutations into the inserts that can prevent viral replication and will reduce sequence fidelity. Instead, use a blue-light (dark reader) based transilluminator box to visualize and cut out inserts.Because of the large volume of digested plasmid to be resolved, a gel apparatus should allow for 50\u201375 \u03bcL volumes per well.All steps prior to fragment assembly can be executed under BSL1/BSL2 conditions. MERS-CoV ligation and subsequent steps must be performed in a biosafety level three containment lab.From this point on all working environments should be RNase free . All reagents should be treated with RNase Zap, or similar treatment, to avoid contamination with RNase.Co-electroporation of full-length viral RNA\nand capped N-gene mRNA has been shown to enhance the transfection efficiency of CoV full-length transcripts.Generally, transcription reactions are performed for a short time at 37 \u00b0C. However, in order to ensure the full transcription of all 30 kb of the genome, and to promote sequence fidelity, a lower temperature and longer reaction time are executed.Because of the relative instability of RNA, the full-length transcription reaction should be performed on the same day as the electroporation, typically 5\u20136 h prior to electroporation.Cells should detach through trypsin digestion and not through physical agitation, as a clean single-cell suspension is desired for efficient electroporation.All subsequent steps should be performed on ice or in a refrigerated centrifuge.Each electroporation cocktail (RNA and cells) should be prepared one at a time. Each subsequent reaction should be prepared following electroporation of the previously prepared cocktail.Successful generation of viral RNA and electroporation will result in loss of cell adherence and cell death within 24\u201372 h of electroporation. The range of times indicated will depend on the infectious clone being generated.Mutant viruses may take longer to show cytopathic effects and may result in lower overall viral titer. If particularly deleterious mutations have been introduced, cytopathic effects may not be seen, and a secondary means of confirmation will be required to assess the success of virus generation. Additional means of confirmation may include staining with antibody and visualizing by immunofluorescence microscopy or isolating total RNA from cell lysates to confirm by RT-PCR .If deleterious mutations have been introduced during cloning, be sure to sequence verify passage 0 and subsequent virus passages, preferentially using P0 virus to assure sequence fidelity.Expanding viral stocks by passage through cell culture can lead to the natural accumulation of tissue culture-adapted mutations. Viral stocks should routinely be sequence validated.Freezing and thawing virus will result in an approximate log drop in titer for each freeze-thaw cycle.Plates should not be disturbed (i.e., moved) during incubation to ensure clear identification of plaques.It is recommended to run wild-type virus and a non-mutated infectious clone virus as controls for a growth curve of any reverse genetics mutant.At the time of writing this chapter MERS-CoV genomic length RNA is not considered a select agent. Therefore, samples can be inactivated in Trizol under BSL3 conditions, and then moved to BSL2 for subsequent work. In the case of select agents, like SARS-CoV, the handling of genomic length RNA falls under the Federal Select Agent Program, and must be handled accordingly.During replication, CoVs generate a nested set of sgRNA intermediates containing the leader sequence at the 5\u2032end, a portion of the ORFs present in the CoV genome, and a 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. 4). As a result, primers built into the leader sequence and the N-gene will generate PCR products of various lengths representing the cDNA from both full-length and sgRNA . If the presence of sgRNA is detected, it can be assumed that the CoV clone is infectious and replication competent.\n",

Using a biotinylated or radioactive probe against the CoV N-gene, all sgRNA species can be visualized by running RNA isolated from CoV-infected cells on a northern gel (left). Northern blot image is reprinted from [25]. Alternately, PCR primers contained within the leader sequence and N-gene can be used to generate PCR products from viral cDNA in order to visualize sgRNA, signifying productive CoV replication (right). Here, PCR products confirm productive replication of MERS-CoV in the lungs of a mouse permissive to MERS-CoV infection (transgenic mouse lung), but not in a nonpermissive, wild-type mouse lung. Both of these methods can be used to confirm productive CoV replication following RGS clone generation",

(a) Genomic representation of an infectious clone of MERS-CoV containing the tomato red fluorescent protein (tRFP) substituted for the orf 5 gene (icMERS-CoV-tRFP). (b) Protein sequence alignment of human, mouse, and chimeric dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ( DPP4) MERS-CoV host receptor sequence with five specific amino acid changes indicated by red arrows. Figure reprinted from [40]. (c) The indicated chimeric DPP4 receptor constructs were overexpressed in 293T cells and subsequently infected with the icMERS-CoV-tRFP virus to map the minimal number of amino acids required to facilitate MERS-CoV infection. Two amino acid changes (A288L and T330R) were sufficient to support infection and replication of MERS-CoV . Figure reprinted from [40]",
