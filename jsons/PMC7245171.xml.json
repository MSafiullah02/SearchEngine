Additionally, she developed neutropenia, anaemia and bone marrow suppression secondary to palbociclib. The administration of prednisolone for intestinal obstruction due to peritoneal tumour progression also contributed to development of the opportunistic infections [not all routes stated; durations of treatments to reactions onsets not stated].",

            "text": "The woman, who had been receiving palbociclib and exemestane for metastatic breast cancer, was admitted to the emergency department in August 2019 due to acute dyspnoea in the setting of severe cellular immunodeficiency. On anamnesis, it was found that she had received first-line therapy with taxanes [specific drug not stated] and bevacizumab, and then consecutive hormone therapies [specific drug not stated] from February 2012 to January 2019. A symptomatic peritoneal tumour progression had occurred in January 2019. Oral palbociclib 125mg per day was then started in 4-week cycles (3 weeks on followed by 1 week off) concomitantly with exemestane 25mg per day. In May 2019, she had developed an intestinal obstruction due to peritoneal disease. Both CT scan and cancer antigen 15-3 had shown no evidence of disease progression. In May 2019, she had started receiving prednisolone 40mg daily for 5 days, followed by 20mg daily for long-term management of the intestinal obstruction associated with peritoneal disease. According to the palbociclib-induced neutropenia management guidelines, the dosage of palbociclib had been decreased from 125mg per day to 100mg per day. A CT scan performed in the July 2019 had shown no evidence of the disease progression. During the current admission in August 2019, she was admitted due to the deterioration of general status and fever. She had an underlying hypercalcaemia. She received bisphosphonates [specific drug not stated] for hypercalcaemia. She was diagnosed with obstructive pyelonephritis as a result of double J-catheter impairment. Bacteriological investigation showed colonisation with Enterococcus faecalis and Klebsiella oxytoca. Consequently, she underwent ureteral stents replacement and received piperacillin/tazobactam for 7 days. She remained persistently febrile, with acute respiratory symptoms (coughing, phlegm and dyspnoea). Blood culture was found to be negative. Urine antigen tests for the diagnosis of respiratory infections (legionellosis and pneumococcal pneumonia) were found to be negative. Chest X-ray and CT scan confirmed acute diffuse interstitial pneumonia. A bronchial wash was performed and PCR assays for influenza virus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus were found to be negative. However, a Pneumocystis-specific PCR was found to be positive, conferring the development of pneumocystis pneumonia. She was then found to be positive for fungal \u03b2-D-Glucan antigen. She was also found to have a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus niger. A PCR revealed reactivation of multiple latent viruses comprising Herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella-zoster virus, Aleution disease virus and Cytomegalovirus. Viral cytomegalovirus level was mildly increased in both the plasma and in the bronchial washing fluid. After a close observation of her medical records, it was found that she had a decreased lymphocyte count from 1.3 g/L in January 2019 (i.e. at the time of palbociclib and exemestane initiation) to <0.5 g/L in May 2019. It was concluded that she had grade 3 lymphopenia. Grade 2 anaemia and grade 3 neutropenia was also observed. Immunophenotyping of peripheral T-lymphocytes showed a reduction in absolute number of CD4+ T cells, suggestive of palbociclib-induced bone marrow suppression. The HIV virus test was found to be negative. The anaemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and bone marrow suppression were considered secondary to the administration of palbociclib. Additionally, the role of exemestane in the development of lymphopenia was also considered.",

However, she experienced no improvement and her respiratory status deteriorated. Due to the treatment failure and severe deterioration in her general status, she was initiated on best supportive care [details not stated]. She died a few days later due to pneumocystis pneumonia.",
