To combat this pandemic, different strategies need to be tailored and implemented in countries with different situations. First, in countries with an ongoing explosion of the outbreak (i.e. the USA, Spain, and Italy), strategies suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) which have been proven useful in China should be adopted for implementation. Secondly, countries in the regions that are still at the early stages of the outbreak (i.e., the Africa region, where many countries have only found imported cases) should further strengthen travel restrictions to reduce the risk of imported cases as well as the risk of developing local transmission. Furthermore, countries that have achieved great success in COVID control (i.e. China, South Korea, and Singapore) should continue implement the successful strategies and further roll-out strengthened new strategies to prevent new imported cases. In addition, surveillance on the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 is in need in all countries as some studies have found multiple mutants of SARS-CoV-2, although the impact of the mutation on the infectivity and lethality of the virus was still unclear.",

This was very different from the situation on March 14 when Italy was the only European country with over 10,000 cases. 1 In addition to Europe, North America has become the second-largest battlefield, and the number of confirmed cases in the United States rapidly increased to 124,739 on March 28. 2 Although Iran has also been another epidemic center since early March, development of the disease outbreak in the Eastern Mediterranean Region has been slow and most of Iran's neighboring countries had reported less than 1,000 cases by March 28. 1 The pattern of the global epidemic has changed dynamically from the first stage of a single epidemic center (China) in January and February to the second stage of multiple epidemic centers (Italy, Iran, and South Korea) in March.Toward the end of March, however, the world began experiencing a rapidly increasing number of cases with an estimated 50,000 cases confirmed globally per day.

In addition, based on the lessons learned from the countries that have experienced the severity of this pandemic, countries in the African region should implement stricter strategies in preventing the establishment of local transmission, allocating resources to improve testing and facilitating their preparation in response to any potential rapid local transmission. In addition, strategies aimed to reduce hospital-acquired infection, which usually happens at the early stage of the outbreak, should be emphasized. Given the limited resources in the region, researchers in the region should also focus on identifying the most cost-effective COVID-19 prevention and control strategies and facilitate the rapid implementation of these strategies to prevent the eruption of an epidemic center in the region.",
