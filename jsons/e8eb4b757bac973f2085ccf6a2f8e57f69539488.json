The model proposed is based on the available facts like the onset of lockdown (as announced by the Government on 25 th day, \u03c40 and the recovery pattern dictated by a mean life recovery time of \u03c41 (normally said to be around 14 days). The data of infected COVID-19 patients from March 2, to April 16, 2020 has been used to fit the evolution of infected, recovery and death counts. A slow rising exponential growth, with R0 close to 1/6, is found to represent the infected counts indicating almost a linear rise. The rest of growth, saturation and decay of data is comprehensibly modelled by incorporating lockdown time controlled R0, having a normal error function like behaviour decaying to zero in some time frame of \u03c42 . The recovery mean life time \u03c41 dictates the peak and decay. The results predicted for coming days are interesting and optimistic. The introduced time constants based on experimental data for both the recovery rate as well as for determining the time span of activity of R0 after the lockdown are subject of debate and provide possibility to introduce trigger factors to alter these to be more suited to the model. The model can be extended to other communities with their own R0 and recovery time parameters.",

Waking up lethargically in the new year, we slowly had to accept the reality that most part this year was an exceptional year of destruction without a blast. The new disease initiated during the fag end of 2019, identified as COVID-19 virus infection was declared Pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020 as it engulfed almost the entire globe in a span of a couple of months. Every day the data throws more and more deaths, disease and helplessness with little hope of recovery. The scale of death, misery, helplessness and negativity caused by the disease is monumental. There is great deal of pessimism at this point of time. We don't seem to know when and if this will end and how. Therefore, during such times a convincing forecast based on acceptable physical, data based arguments becomes necessary. This paper presents simple physical model based on data to show how and when we will come over this pessimism. Though the model proposed is India specific, but in quick time the results can be recalculated for any country or community using the same source code.",

The alarming number of deaths predicted in this work motivated me to apply simple physical methods of growth and decay to make a fresh assessment. Indeed simulation models many times lack in insight and non-transparent making it difficult to find the control factors of the real processes.",

There are other studies on similar lines [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] expressing projections of this epidemic, including some theoretical analysis of epidemic sometimes using statistical physics have been made in the past [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .

As can be easily observed from Fig. 6 , the observed data fits excellently to an exponential growth but with a small rate of increase. The fit has been incorporated into an expected evolution of infected number assuming a lockdown initiation. As R tends to zero, the number saturates. Again, when recovery is introduced in mean half life of 50 days, we get a peaked curve which may be a true picture, provided no new factors emerge.

There may be possible objections to the choice of breadth of R after lockdown. There are also additional factors which develop as some hotspots emerging. A more realistic model needs to address these issues. However a new way to establish the data based theoretical model gives a new idea with great insight into how the factors are controlled and should be applied in most such studies instead of simulations where the contact with the processes is lost.",
