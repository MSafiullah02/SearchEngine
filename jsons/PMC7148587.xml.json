            "text": "Several species of vertebrates, especially mammals, have been successful invaders and colonizers of new territories, in particular, insular island ecosystems. Others have exhibited high environmental tolerance and adaptability after careful and repeated introductions to new locales by humans. Following establishment, several vertebrate species have become important pests. These pests harm agricultural systems by damaging agricultural lands [e.g., rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus Linnaeus) in Australia and New Zealand], by attacking crops [e.g., European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris Linnaeus) in the United States], and by acting as sources for communicable diseases [e.g., brushtail possums, (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr), are reservoirs for bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis Karlson and Lessel) in New Zealand]. Other pest vertebrates damage natural systems by threatening the continued existence of endangered flora [e.g., goats (Capra hircus Linnaeus) on the Galapagos Islands] and fauna [e.g., brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis {Merrem}) on Guam], and by adversely affecting wilderness areas by changing ecosystem functions and diversity (Vitousek et al., 1996). The continued relocation of vertebrates exacerbates the ongoing problem of global homogenization of biota (Lodge, 1993).",

The vast majority of vertebrate translocations have been human assisted. Accidental introduction has occurred as a consequence of human transportation [e.g., brown tree snakes, mice (Mus musculus Linnaeus), and rats such as Rattus rattus Linnaeus and R. norvegicus Berkenhout)]. Some releases have been intentional (but illegal) to serve self-centered private interests [e.g., monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus {Boddaert}) in New York, Florida, and Texas]. Other species have been legitimately introduced to procure public benefit by providing: (1) new agricultural products [e.g., European wild boars (Sus scrofa Linnaeus); sheep (Ovis aries Linnaeus); cows (Bos taurus Linnaeus), goats and rabbits for meat, and brushtail possums for fur in New Zealand], (2) recreation [e.g., red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus), fallow deer (Dama dama Linnaeus), and trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus and S. gairdneri Richardson) in New Zealand]; (3) companionship [e.g., cats (Felis domesticus Linnaeus) and dogs (Canis familiaris Linnaeus)]; or (4) biological control agents [e.g., the European fox (Vulpes vulpes Linnaeus), stoats (Mustela erminea Linnaeus), weasels (M. nivalis Linnaeus), and ferrets (M. putorius furo Linnaeus) for the control of rabbits in Australia or New Zealand; cane toads (Bufo marinus Linnaeus) for control of gray-backed cane beetles (Dermolepida albohirtum {Waterhouse}) in sugarcane plantations in Australia; and the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus {Saint-Hilaire}, {= auropunctatus (Hodgson)}) for control of rats in Hawaii].",

Biological control of vertebrates, a potentially less expensive and self-sustaining method of population suppression, has focused primarily on mammalian pests. Predators, parasites, and pathogens specific to mammals with two notable exceptions (the myxoma and calici viruses that infect rabbits) have failed to provide satisfactory control (Shelford, 1942; Howard, 1967; Davis et al., 1976; Wood, 1985; Smith & Remington, 1996; Whisson, 1998). Historical records indicate that the majority of attempts at vertebrate biological control have been ad hoc efforts and not the product of careful studies designed to elucidate factors and conditions likely to affect the impact of natural enemy introductions on pest populations. Furthermore, failure of biological control of vertebrates by predatory vertebrates has compounded problems associated with exotic vertebrates because control attempts result in addition of new species that cause biological and conservation problems.",

Immunocontraception utilizes genetically modified pathogens that express surface proteins from the target pest's egg or sperm to induce an immune response in the host. Antibodies then attack gametes in the host's reproductive tract causing sterilization (Tyndale-Biscoe, 1994b, 1995). Computer models indicate that immunocontraception may provide long-term control of vertebrate pests because genetically modified pathogens reduce net reproductive rates without killing hosts (Barlow, 1994, 1997).",

Elton (1958) suggested that species-poor communities (e.g., islands) or highly disturbed habitats are more permissive to successful introductions of new species. Elton's (1958) predictions have been substantiated in part by paleobiological reconstructions of invasions between newly joined communities (Vermeiji, 1991) and by mathematical modeling describing multi-species interactions in communities (MacArthur, 1955; Case, 1991). Isolated oceanic islands (e.g., New Zealand), and insular continents and habitats (e.g., Australia and lakes) often have a low diversity of native species. Such environments have typically experienced little immigration and are susceptible to invasion by vertebrates (Brown, 1989). Stable, speciose communities with high levels of interspecific competition appear to resist invasion by new species and are sources of successful colonists into less speciose or disturbed communities (MacArthur, 1955; Brown, 1989; Lodge 1993). This phenomenon has produced asymmetrical patterns of colonization, with successful vertebrate invaders usually being native to continents or extensive nonisolated habitats within continents with more diverse biotas (Brown, 1989; Vermeiji, 1991).",

Niches equivalent to those on the mainland are largely unoccupied (Brown, 1989). Insular ecosystems therefore often appear to readily accommodate generalist herbivores and predators, perhaps because of low levels of competition for resources that are often inadequately defended chemically or physically (Vitousek, 1990; Vermeij, 1991; Bowen & van Vuren, 1997). Organisms from insular habitats that have not coevolved closely with predators or herbivores lack life history features that deter attack or permit survival despite high mortality from predation or herbivory (Bowen & van Vuren, 1997). Lack of such biological attributes may increase the competitive advantage of exotics (Case, 1996; Coblentz, 1978; Vitousek, 1990).",

European rodent populations exhibit fluctuations in size as a response to variation in food availability. These fluctuations are also influenced by predation.

Mouse populations are regulated in a similar fashion by predators (raptors and foxes) in Australia (Sinclair et al., 1990).

The model suggests that once prey populations fall below certain densities (i.e., because of culling or disease) predators can prevent recovery to higher levels. Generalist predators achieve this by maintaining relatively high numbers by attacking alternate prey species, and low but persistent levels of predation on species in the pit prevents pest populations from outbreaking. For the rabbit\u2013fox system in Australia, a predator pit operates at densities of 8 to 15 rabbits per kilometer of linear transect. Below these densities foxes utilize alternate food sources (e.g., native animals) and above this critical density rabbit populations escape regulation by predators (Newsome, 1990). In New Zealand, rabbits are contained in the pit by cats and ferrets when densities are 0.4 rabbits per hectare (Barlow & Wratten, 1996). The effect of predators on long-term population dynamics of alternate prey species is generally difficult to disentangle from confounding effects of habitat degradation and competition for food and breeding sites from other introduced species (Pech et al., 1995).",

Predation by abundant predators on secondary prey (e.g., native animals) result, leading to declines in secondary prey density. Under such circumstances native prey species may only persist in refugia or in areas with artificially reduced predator pressure (Pech et al., 1995). Alternatively, declining densities of a primary pest prey species (either through management or disease) can intensify predator attacks on nontarget organisms. Therefore, when conservation of endangered natives is a concern, culling of predators may be undertaken either concurrently with the decline in prey density or in anticipation of such a decline (Grant Norbury, personal communication, 1997). In such situations an integrated approach to managing vertebrate pests and their predators is necessary (Newsome, 1990).",

Barn owl numbers and predation rates on rodents increased following habitat modification (Mu\u00f1oz & Mur\u00faa, 1990). Under increased predation pressure, rodents will modify foraging behaviors by reducing activity when owls are flying or making hunger calls (Abramsky et al., 1996). Learning in this manner produces behavioral adaptations because of strong selection pressures to minimize predation risks on pest populations (Davis et al., 1976).",

Host parasite load also affects the ability of individual parasites to grow, reproduce, and survive in definitive hosts; and the severity of density dependence on host and parasite fitness is affected by patterns of parasite distribution in host populations (Scott & Lewis, 1987). Helminths, for example, tend to be aggregated within host populations so that few hosts are heavily burdened while most are lightly infected (Scott & Lewis, 1987). Density-dependent constraints on parasite survival and reproduction occur in the few heavily infected hosts, and under such conditions, helminth population stability is enhanced (Anderson & May, 1978; May & Anderson, 1978). Furthermore, parasites with low-to-moderate pathogenicity exert stronger regulatory actions on populations than highly pathogenic species that cause their own extinction by killing hosts before transmission (Anderson, 1979).",

The parasitic helminth Trichostrongylus tenuis (Cobbold) is the primary agent responsible for long-term population cycles in red grouse [Lagopus lagopus scoticus (Latham)] inhabiting Scottish heathlands (Dobson & Hudson, 1994). The regulatory effect of T. tenuis has been demonstrated by reducing parasite infestations with helminthicides in experimental birds. Treated grouse showed increased overwintering survival, clutch sizes, and hatching rates when compared with untreated birds (Dobson & Hudson, 1994). In the laboratory, introduction of the nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus Dujardin reduced mice densities by 94% in comparison with control populations. Reduction of nematode transmission rates and elimination of parasites with helminthicides allowed infested mouse populations to increase (Scott, 1987). Although host and parasite densities in this study were higher than those found in nature, the data showed that introduction of a parasite regulated host population abundance. The potential effectiveness of nematodes as biological control agents in field situations has been evaluated for control of the house mouse, an introduced pest in Australia (Singleton & McCallum, 1990; Spratt, 1990).",

Outbreaks are associated with high autumn rainfalls following prolonged periods of drought that extend the growing season for grasses that set seeds. This high-quality food source increases high mouse survivorship and breeding throughout winter. Population crashes occur when food supplies are exhausted (Singleton, 1989).

It is, however, absent in mouse populations in cereal-growing areas (Singleton et al., 1991). This nematode is unique because it is the only known helminth with a direct life cycle that requires host death for transmission. Female nematodes deposit eggs in the host's liver; and these eggs are liberated by predation, cannibalism, or necrophagy with subsequent digestion of infected liver. Unembryonated nematode eggs voided after ingestion undergo embryonation to become infective and are probably consumed when mice preen their fur and feet (Singleton et al., 1991) (Fig. 1\n). Ground beetles (Carabidae) may vector C. hepatica eggs after they have been eaten (Mobedi & Arfaa, 1971). First-stage larvae emerge from ingested embryonated eggs and move into the liver through the hepatic portal system (Wright, 1961). Nematode infestation significantly reduces natality and numbers of young mice weaned by infected females (McCallum & Singleton, 1989; Singleton & McCallum, 1990; Singleton & Spratt, 1986; Spratt & Singleton, 1986). Capillaria hepatica is associated with introduced rat and mouse species in urban areas, and naturally occurring infections in native Australian mammals are rare probably because of the susceptibility of nematode eggs to ultraviolet radiation and desiccation (Spratt & Singleton, 1986; Singleton et al., 1991). Native Australian mice and marsupials are susceptible to experimental infection in laboratories (Spratt & Singleton, 1986).",

In the absence of resource limitation mouse densities increase similarly to disease-free populations before parasites have an impact and infected populations decline in density (McCallum & Singleton, 1989). Slow regulation of mouse populations occurs because of the need for host death for transmission. Consequently, the nematode's life cycle operates on the same time scale as that of its host instead of being orders of magnitude faster, as is the case with other parasites that do not require host death for transmission (McCallum & Singleton, 1989; Singleton & McCallum, 1990).",

Soil type, temperature, and moisture content do not affect nematode egg survival and embryonation under favorable conditions in outbreak regions (Spratt & Singleton, 1987). Outbreak intensity can theoretically be reduced by C. hepatica if populations are inoculated early, preferably 1 year before an outbreak is expected (McCallum, 1993). Releases of high doses of nematode eggs in the summer or autumn when mouse densities are sufficient to enable high levels of transmission may offer the best chance for successful control (McCallum & Singleton, 1989; McCallum, 1993).",

Transmission of C. hepatica in treated populations is not density dependent and can occur at low levels for 12 to 18 months. Transmission rates show seasonal trends influenced by soil temperatures and increasing aridity (Barker et al., 1991; Singleton & Chambers, 1996).

Sparrows and starlings, both successful colonizing species from Europe, have two to three times fewer parasites in North America compared with populations from which they originated. Populations established outside of Europe may have benefited from reduced parasite burdens, although there are no quantitative data to indicate that this aided establishment and proliferation (Dobson & May, 1986).

Fewer parasites coupled with presumed low genetic diversity of small founding populations, and reduced selection pressures for parasite resistance may make these pest vertebrates vulnerable to introduced host-specific parasites. The ideal parasite introduced into a high-density pest population that originated from a small founding population should have low-to-intermediate pathogenicity, because such parasites establish and maintain themselves in populations at lower densities than more pathogenic species do (Anderson & May, 1978; May & Anderson, 1978). Macroparasites that reduce both host longevity and fecundity may have the potential to cause sustained reductions of host population densities (Dobson, 1988). Low genetic variability among target populations should theoretically enable introduced parasites to become more evenly distributed among hosts, and reduction in parasite aggregation would increase natural-enemy efficacy (Dobson & Hudson, 1986).",

The snake also has caused declines of native reptile and small mammal populations, and enters houses and attacks sleeping human infants (Rodda et al., 1997). Additionally, the brown tree snake has caused economic losses by adversely affecting domestic animals (e.g., chickens and pets), and high densities of snakes on power lines regularly cause short circuits that interrupt electrical supplies and necessitate repairs.

Pathogens tend to be unicellular and exhibit epizootic (i.e., boom or bust) life cycles due to rapid proliferation in hosts (Anderson, 1979; McCallum, 1994). The potential of pathogens to regulate vertebrate population densities by reducing the longevity and fecundity of infected hosts has been demonstrated theoretically with mathematical models and by perturbation experiments using vaccines (Smith, 1994). As with macroparasites, models indicate that microparasites of intermediate pathogenicity are more effective biological control agents (Anderson, 1982). Highly virulent pathogens kill themselves by destroying hosts before they can be transmitted and avirulent strains are not transmitted because they are removed by the immune system. The immune system is theorized as being responsible for maintaining the intermediate virulence of vertebrate microparasites (Anita et al., 1994). Pathogens that are readily transmitted (i.e., microparasites spread by water, air, and vectors) or have high-density host populations are more contagious than those with low transmission rates (i.e., spread is by host-to-host contact) or low host densities (Ebert & Herre, 1996).",

Experimental evidence indicates that novel disease-causing organisms are on average less harmful, less infectious, and less fit than the same parasite strain infecting the host it is adapted to (Ebert & Herre, 1996). Also, a microparasite's ability to infect and exploit novel hosts decreases with increasing geographic and presumably genetic distance from the host to which the pathogen is adapted (Ebert, 1994). Exceptions do occur, however, and pathogens can have devastating impacts on hosts that have no evolutionary history with the disease organism. An example is the myxoma virus, the causative agent of myxomatosis in European rabbits. The use of this natural enemy against rabbits in Australia and Europe has been the most thorough biological control program against a vertebrate pest.",

The virus initially had a major impact on the estimated 600 million rabbits and on the damage they caused, reducing population density by 75 to 95%.

A second highly contagious viral disease emerged in the mid-1980s and was accidentally introduced onto mainland Australia (O'Brien, 1991). It is the first pathogenic natural enemy to have established in New Zealand for biological control of rabbits. Rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD) [also known as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV)] emerged as a fatal disease in 1984 in Angora rabbits exported from East Germany to Jiangsu Province of China (Liu et al., 1984). In 1986, the disease appeared in Italy where 38 million rabbits were estimated to have died. The disease spread rapidly through rabbit populations in Europe reaching the United Kingdom in 1992 (Chasey, 1994). The probable mechanism for dispersal in continental Europe was the movement of live rabbits and rabbit products. Transmission of RCD from France into coastal areas of southeast England is thought to have occurred by wind-borne aerosols containing virus, birds, and transchannel ferry traffic (Chasey, 1994). Outbreaks of RCD occurred in Mexico in 1988 and 1989 (Gregg et al., 1991) and in R\u00e9union Island in the Indian Ocean in 1989. Movement of RCD to these areas probably occurred with imports of frozen rabbit carcasses from China because the virus can survive freezing to temperatures of \u221220\u00b0C (Chasey, 1994).",

Disease symptoms are characterized by high morbidity and mortality in rabbits over 8 weeks of age. Younger rabbits often survive infection and may develop antibodies to RCD virus (Nagesha et al., 1995). Clinically, RCD symptoms are expressed after an incubation period of 24 to 48 h in which a febrile response and increasing lethargy are observed. Infected rabbits typically die within 12 to 72 h postinfection and 90% mortality is observed after 5 days. Necropsies show a pale swollen friable liver, enlarged spleen, and clots in blood vessels. Death is ascribed to acute necrotizing hepatitis and possible hemorrhaging (Fuchs & Weissenb\u00f6ck, 1992; Studdert, 1994). However, necropsies close to the time of death show an absence of hemorrhaging and inclusion of hemorrhagic in the name of this rabbit disease that indicates the cause of death is misleading (Studdert, 1994).",

The disease was first recorded in Sweden in 1980, and spread through continental Europe and reached the United Kingdom in 1990 (Fuller et al., 1993). In Sweden, losses of hares to EBHS occurred 10 years prior to sympatric rabbit populations developing RCD. Similar observations were made in the United Kingdom where hares began dying from EBHS 2 years before RCD was observed in rabbit populations (Fuller et al., 1993). Electron microscopy, nucleotide sequencing, and experimental cross-transmission studies have indicated that RCD virus and EBHS virus are closely related (Le Gall et al., 1996) but distinct members of the Caliciviridae (Chasey et al., 1992; Nowotny et al., 1997). Disease symptoms are generally similar for rabbits and hares but show distinguishing characteristics in necrosis of liver lobules and clotting of blood vessels (Fuchs & Weissenb\u00f6ck, 1992). Serological studies on rabbit sera collected in 1961 from Czechoslovakia and Austria indicate that RCD virus probably evolved from an apathogenic strain endemic to Europe from at least this time (Nowotny et al., 1997).",

Adaptation may have occurred because mutations caused increased virulence in an avirulent rabbit virus or increased the host range of hare-infecting viruses by allowing mutant strains to bind more efficiently to surface receptors on rabbit hepatocytes.

Studies monitoring the effects of RCD virus on rabbit populations were initiated on Wardang Island near Adelaide off the south coast of Australia in 1995 (Rudzki, 1995; Robinson & Westbury, 1996). In September 1995, RCD breached quarantine and appeared on mainland Australia, possibly carried there by calliphorid flies and onshore winds (Cooke, 1996; Lawson, 1995). Attempts at containment failed (Seife, 1996). Within 2 months of the initial discovery of RCD virus on the mainland, an estimated 5 million rabbits were killed in South Australia. In dry areas, 80 to 95% of infected populations died (Anderson, 1995) with dead rabbits averaging 15 per hectare. Elsewhere, fatality rates were closer to 65% (Anonymous, 1997b). In the period from October to November 1995, an estimated total of 30 million rabbits died from RCD in South Australia and the majority of surviving rabbits were less than 6 weeks of age (Cooke, 1996). The development of resistance in young rabbits may have profound effects on the long-term population dynamics on the rabbit\u2013RCD virus system. Ten arthropod vectors of RCD virus have been identified and include flies, mosquitoes, and rabbit fleas (Anonymous, 1997b).",

The New Zealand government has sanctioned controlled virus releases into new areas.

Virions found in high concentrations in feces, urine, saliva, and vomit were transmitted through direct contact between cats or contact with contaminated objects (Howell, 1984). Annual declines of cat numbers were 29% from 1977 to 1982. This rate decreased to 8% per year from 1981 to 1983 and was accompanied by lower titers of virus in serum samples collected from feral cats, indicating that viral efficacy was decreasing (van Rensburg et al., 1987).

Pest vertebrates have high r\nm values characterized by large litters, and by maturing sexually at young ages. Agents that reduce reproductive rates may be more effective for control than mortality-inducing biological control agents are because resistance development should take longer to occur and population recovery would be slower (Tyndale-Biscoe, 1994b). Resistance development may be further delayed by combined use of multiple agents that affect fertility in different ways [e.g., using agents that cause sterilization, alter levels of reproductive hormones, or affect lactation (Cowan & Tyndale-Biscoe, 1997)]. In sexually reproducing vertebrates, proteins associated with male and female gametes are potentially foreign antigens in the opposite sex. Exposure to reproductive antigens occurs when females receive sperm and accessory fluids from males during copulation. As a general rule, females do not develop antibodies to these antigens because physiological and immunological mechanisms have evolved to prevent this (Robinson & Holland, 1995). Inoculation of sperm into females of the same species either subcutaneously or intramuscularly produces high sperm antigen antibody titers in recipients. In most cases, this causes either permanent or temporary infertility in females. Such results indicate that sperm antigens in the reproductive tract are tolerated and that exposure to these antigens by different routes overcomes protective mechanisms, with infertility resulting (Robinson & Holland, 1995).",

Free-ranging feral mares inoculated by dart gun with porcine zona pellucida showed depressed urinary estrogen concentrations and failure to ovulate. Zona booster inoculations given 2 years after initial inoculations prevented conception in treated horses for a third year compared with control populations that were not vaccinated. Contraceptive effects were reversible after 4 years of consecutive treatment, but prolonged treatment (5 to 7 years) with zona preparations caused irreversible ovarian dysfunction and fertility loss (Kirkpatrick et al., 1992, 1997). Similar results have been achieved with porcine zona pellucida inoculations in white-tail deer [Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman)] (Kirkpatrick et al., 1997).",

Potential baits include dried meats that contain microencapsulated antigens. Use of recombinant bacterial vectors (e.g., Salmonella typhimurium) also are being considered. An orally administered agent needs to reach the lower gastrointestinal tract to stimulate a response in the common mucosal immune system in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue.

Problems of hormonal modification of behavior and delayed population control are additional drawbacks. One advantage is that baits can be used to treat localized populations that are problematic. Similar shortcomings exist with antigen inoculations by projectiles where cost estimates are significant. To control the estimated 300,000 wild horses in Australia with dart-delivered porcine zona pellucida would cost $20 (Australian) per horse per year compared with 50 cents for permanent control with a bullet (Tyndale-Biscoe, 1991). Lethal methods of control provide immediate impact on pest populations and reduce pest status rapidly, with control being quickly observable. In contrast, fertility impairment is not immediate, population responses are delayed, and large proportions of populations need to be sterilized for this technique to be effective. Large-scale distribution of gametic antigens might be possible through releases of host-specific microparasites expressing species-specific antigen genes (Tyndale-Biscoe, 1994a, 1994b). Self-spreading and replicating parasitic vectors that have been genetically engineered and that may require periodic reinoculation into populations are analogous to augmentative biological control programs with traditional natural enemies (e.g., parasitoids, predators, or pathogens) released periodically for the control of pest arthropods.",

This technique prevents conception among predetermined proportions of females in populations without interfering with hormones or reproductive behavior (Williams & Twigg, 1996). The dynamics of 12 rabbit populations enclosed by rabbit-proof fencing that exhibited 0, 40, 60, or 80% sterilization of females were studied in each of two locations in western and eastern Australia where climate patterns differed. Females born into treatment populations were trapped and sterilized to maintain the same overall sterility levels (Williams & Twigg, 1996). Juvenile rabbits born into populations with sterilized females exhibited greater survivorship because of lowered competition for resources. This greater survival compensated for decreased fertility, but recruitment rates were ultimately constrained by environmental factors (e.g., depletion of vegetation). In populations with 80% sterility, reduced juvenile mortality did not compensate fully for lowered reproduction, smaller numbers of rabbits were recruited into these populations, and numbers subsequently declined. These results indicate that levels of sterilization with a genetically altered micorparasite have to reach at least 80% to achieve reductions in population density (Williams & Twigg, 1996).",

Higher proportions of sterile females may reduce numbers of infective individuals harboring sterilizing microparasites and numbers of vectors (e.g., fleas that would spread an engineered myxoma virus), and may contribute to decline of transmission rates.

This is of special concern when pests inhabit suburbs, urban parks, government and state campuses, nature reserves, military bases, or other areas where lethal controls may no longer be legal or safe (Kirkpatrick et al., 1997; Williams, 1997). The concept of virally mediated immunocontraception has generated considerable debate on legal and ethical issues concerning releases of engineered microorgansims into the environment.

Under certain circumstances, the use of vectors to disseminate genetically engineered viruses is warranted (McCallum, 1996). Experience with the myxoma virus in Australia indicates that it has not been deliberately or accidentally spread to any other country since its introduction in the 1950s because of either the lack of suitable arthropod vectors or the inability of the virus to establish where different strains are already present. This history may indicate possible difficulty for unintentional establishment of genetically engineered microparasites in new areas, and establishment of engineered myxoma viruses may be possible only with carefully timed and repeated releases into rabbit populations (Tyndale-Biscoe, 1995).",

New Zealand's experience with RCD indicates it is possible for lay people to illegally import and establish reproducing populations of exotic pathogens. In Australia, RCD breached a carefully planned quarantine on an offshore island. Unintended establishment and proliferation of engineered viruses may be contained if outbreaks are recognized early, and if proportions of susceptible individuals are removed rapidly from the population either by culling or by immunizing against the pathogen (Tyndale-Biscoe, 1995). This has never been tried with wild animal populations. The containment of contagious pathogens, such as foot and mouth disease in livestock, indicates such an approach may be possible. Highly attenuated forms of myxoma virus are used to protect wild and domestic rabbits in France and the United States, indicating the availability of such technology for this virus at least (Fenner & Ross, 1994; Tyndale-Biscoe, 1995).
