The case was later identified in September 2012 as a novel betacoronavirus belonging to lineage C (Zaki et al., 2012). Retrospective testing of samples in the Middle East identified a further nine cases in Jordan (Hijawi et al., 2013). The disease was considered a clinical syndrome ranging from asymptomatic cases to respiratory failure to multisystem organ failure. The syndrome was termed \u201cMiddle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome\u201d (MERS) and testing was performed accordingly in the Middle East and for return travellers from Middle East countries based on epidemiological risk factors.",

He was transferred from Qatar to a hospital in England where he clinically deteriorated and was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) however, unfortunately had a fatal outcome (Bermingham et al., 2012). A second case in the UK was confirmed in February 2013, in a return traveler from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who was admitted with severe acute respiratory symptoms. This patient required ECMO treatment, however also unfortunately died. This case resulted in onward transmission to two further cases, of which one subsequently died (The Health Protection Agency UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation team C, 2013). In August 2018, a fifth case of MERS was diagnosed in a return traveler from the Middle East. The patient was initially admitted to a hospital in Leeds and then transferred to a specialist infectious disease unit in Liverpool. The patient had a positive outcome and there was no onward transmission of MERS-CoV to the close contacts (PHE, 2018)",

Nosocomial outbreaks have occurred in Saudi Arabia and South Korea demonstrating the need for stringent infection control polices (Park et al., 2015). In view of the high risk of imported cases, Public Health England (PHE) commissioned regional centers to perform MERS-CoV testing for possible MERS cases arriving in England. PHE Manchester laboratory is one of two centers that currently perform testing for MERS-CoV. It receives samples from the Greater Manchester region and surrounding counties of Lancashire, Merseyside, Cumbria and Cheshire. Additionally it receives samples from other areas of the North-West region of the United Kingdom which entails the counties of Yorkshire, Humber and also the counties of the North-East region.",

The GM region also has a Muslim population of 15.8% (Office for National Statistics O, 2019, Review WP, 2018) which is greater than the national average in the United Kingdom of 5% (Office for National Statistics O, 2019). The Muslim population will visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) at least once in their lifetime to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the compulsory pilgrimage of Hajj. Over 2 million pilgrims from 188 countries attend the Hajj annually, which may result in dissemination of MERS-CoV or other pathogens to multiple countries, including to the United Kingdom. Muslims also travel to KSA for Umrah (mini-pilgrimage) and Ramadan which may increase the possibility of the spread of MERS.",

Additionally, it is noted that sputum PCR positivity is higher than the combined pool positivity of all nose, throat and combined nose-throat swabs.

            "text": "With the positive MERS-CoV case in August 2018 in the UK and previous devastating nosocomial outbreaks of MERS in the world, it is essential to raise awareness of this fatal pathogen. We need to continue proactive investigation and rapidly identify and isolate possible MERS-CoV patients after return from the Middle East. We need to continue surveillance of returning travellers at risk for MERS-CoV infection not only to further the knowledge of this important syndrome but also to facilitate the public health response and management of cases. MERS-CoV is a high consequence infectious disease which requires the highest vigilance to ensure preventing its spread and lethal outcomes.",
