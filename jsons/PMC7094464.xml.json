            "text": "Neutralizing antiviral antibodies have become a potent tool for the treatment and prevention of severe viral infections during the past decades (Marasco and Sui, 2007). Polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations derived from immunized human donors are used against a wide range of viral infections, such as the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), rabies and other viral infections (Both et al., 2013). However, the efficacy of such preparations is limited since virus-specific neutralizing antibodies are only a minor proportion of the total pool of polyclonal serum-derived antibodies (Marasco and Sui, 2007). The development of the hybridoma technology for the production of monoclonal antibodies by K\u00f6hler & Milstein in 1975 was a mile stone in the antibody field and led to the isolation of numerous monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Kohler and Milstein, 1975). From then on, numerous potent antiviral monoclonal antibodies against H5N1 influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other viruses causing dangerous infections were isolated and are currently in clinical studies or even approved for antiviral treatment (Bornholdt et al., 2016; Both et al., 2013; Caskey et al., 2016; Kwong et al., 2013; Pelegrin et al., 2015; Traggiai et al., 2004). Human monoclonal antibodies can be isolated from the B-cells of patients who have recovered from disease (e.g. SARS or Ebola) or are long-term controllers of chronic infections (e.g. HIV or herpesviruses). Several technologies are available including the immortalization of human B-cells with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Ali et al., 2015; Traggiai et al., 2004), generation of stable human hybridomas (Yu et al., 2008), direct cloning of the heavy and light antibody chains (VH and VL genes) into phage expression libraries (Diebolder et al., 2014; Marks et al., 1991; McCafferty et al., 1990) or the generation of monoclonal antibodies from single human B-cells by single cell PCR (Tiller et al., 2008; Wardemann et al., 2003). Many of these strategies are time-consuming and laborious. In the case of working with EBV-immortalized B-cells or hybridoma cells, the sorting of antigen-specific donor B-cells prior to culturing can significantly facilitate the identification of rare B-cells secreting neutralizing antibodies (Kodituwakku et al., 2003; Morris et al., 2011; Potzsch et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016). For this purpose, donor B-cells are presorted by flow cytometry techniques using recombinant viral glycoproteins. This strategy is highly promising if the target antigen of the neutralizing antibodies is known or if the virus incorporates only one or two surface glycoproteins as potential targets of neutralizing antibodies (e.g. Ebola) (Zhang et al., 2016). In the case of complex viruses like the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) or the herpes simplex viruses (HSV), an enrichment of antigen-specific B-cells may be highly challenging, particularly if the target antigen is not exactly known. Herpesviruses use complex entry machinery consisting of numerous glycoproteins (Connolly et al., 2011; Sathiyamoorthy et al., 2017). Four viral glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH and gL) are required and sufficient for HSV-1 and 2 entry into host cells (Agelidis and Shukla, 2015). HCMV uses two distinct pathways to enter host cells. While gB represents the fusion protein, two different glycoprotein complexes control the cell tropism of the virus: the gH/gL/gO trimer is involved in the infection of all cell types, while the gH/gL/pUL128/pUL130/pUL131A pentamer is additionally required for the infection of endothelial, epithelial and myeloid cells (Kabanova et al., 2016; Vanarsdall and Johnson, 2012; Zhou et al., 2015). Neutralizing antibodies targeting such complexes often bind to conformation-dependent epitopes (Bender et al., 2007; Chandramouli et al., 2017; Ciferri et al., 2015; Gardner et al., 2016; Macagno et al., 2010; Ohlin et al., 1993; Wussow et al., 2014). Obviously, a critical factor for the successful isolation of monoclonal antibodies from blood donors is a proper screening strategy. The most crucial element of the detection strategy is a highly specific antibody-antigen interaction. A prerequisite to identify such antibodies is the use of a correctly folded antigen or antigen complex. This issue may be simple for viruses using only one glycoprotein for cell entry (e.g. Ebola), but challenging for herpesviruses using highly complex entry machinery. Therefore, conventional screening strategies based on single recombinant proteins may be unsuitable to identify antibodies/B-cells specific for such antigens (de Alwis et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2016). Prior studies have shown that some dengue virus neutralizing antibodies target complex epitopes that exist in a correct conformational state only on the surface of the virion particle, but not on a recombinant soluble antigen (Smith et al., 2014). A promising strategy to improve the recovery of rare neutralizing antibodies to complex epitopes can be the inclusion of a whole virus-based screening of EBV-immortalized B-cells or hybridomas into the standard antibody isolation protocol prior to the amplification of VH/VL genes for antibody production.",

Non-specific binding was blocked with PBS containing 0.5% BSA (Life Technologies Gibco) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the plates were washed three times with PBS. Immobilized HSV-1 \u0394gE was then incubated with different numbers (500, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1) of murine hybridoma cells secreting the monoclonal antibody mAb 2c and SP2/0 cells secreting the humanized counterpart mAb hu2c. Both antibodies recognize a conformational epitope on the HSV-1 gB. The cells were diluted in culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, respectively. As control, either murine H34-hybridoma cells or human IM9 multiple myeloma cells were added as an unspecific control to reach a total number of 500 cells/well. The cultures were then incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 thereby lysing the cells in order to remove cells and unbound antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using an ultra-sensitive ABC mouse IgG staining kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 32052). The kit includes a goat-anti-mouse (GAM) IgG-specific, biotin-conjugated secondary antibody. The bound secondary antibody was then incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) complexes to maximize the signal. The secondary antibody in combination with the avidin-peroxidase complex was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing three times with PBS 0.2% Tween 20. The same kit was used to detect bound humanized mAb hu2c, but the secondary antibody was replaced by a biotin conjugated goat-anti-human (GAH) IgG-specific secondary antibody (cat. no. 109-065-008, JacksonImmunoReseacrh, Cambridgeshire, UK). TMB-ELISA substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was then incubated for up to 15 min, until a characteristic colour change was detectable. The reaction was stopped with 2 M sulfuric acid (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) and the signal was measured by spectrophotometry (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany) at 450 nm. Cut-off was defined as a 3-fold value of the PBS control.",

The assay is designed for the screening of antibody-secreting cells or cell culture supernatants for HSV-specific antibodies. Microtiter plates are coated with HSV-1 \u0394gE lacking the HSV-Fc-receptor (gE/gI complex) to minimize unspecific binding of antibodies (Fig. 1A). The binding of the IgG-Fc domain to the HSV-Fc-receptor is species-specific. In contrast to murine antibodies, human IgGs bind to the HSV-1 Fc-receptor (Sprague et al., 2006). To exclude unspecific binding when working with human antibody-secreting cells or antibodies in subsequent studies, we decided to establish this assay with the HSV-1 \u0394gE mutant. The immobilized virus is then fixed and overlaid with murine human antibody-secreting cells. The cells are incubated for 48 h with the immobilized virus (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, antibody-secreting cells and HSV-unspecific antibodies are removed (Fig. 1C). Bound HSV-specific antibodies can be detected with a peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 1D). Cell cultures positive for virus-specific antibodies can subsequently be diluted to single cell level, expanded, retested for specific antibodies and selected for the production of monoclonal antibodies.",

The method was established for the detection of cells secreting murine and human antibodies. As a model system for cells secreting murine or human antibodies, we used a murine hybridoma cell line 2c and a stably transfected Sp2/0-Ag14 cell line producing the humanized antibody mAb hu2c. Both antibodies are specific for a conformational epitope on the glycoprotein B of HSV-1/2 (Eis-Hubinger et al., 1993; Krawczyk et al., 2013; Krawczyk et al., 2011). Microtiter plates are coated with HSV-1 \u0394gE. Immobilized HSV-1 \u0394gE was then incubated with distinct numbers of either 2c-hybridoma cells or Sp2/0-Ag14 cells (500, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5 and 1) secreting murine or humanized HSV-1 specific antibodies. The cells were mixed with the respective number of murine, Friend-Virus-specific H34 hybridoma cells or human IM9 cells secreting a monoclonal antibody not specific for HSV-1 as an unspecific control to reach an equal number of 500 cells per well. H34 or IM9 cells alone served as a background control. The cut-off was defined as the twofold value of the unspecific background measured for 500 H34 or IM9 cells, respectively.",

HCMV-gH-specific hybridoma cells (clone H10) served as a positive control as the respective antibodies can bind to the surface of virions. Hybridoma cells of clone 28\u201377 served as a background control as they release antibodies directed against an HCMV tegument protein (pp65), which is not accessible at the surface of virions. In addition, a mixture of both hybridoma cells was applied, seeding 10 cells of clone H10 together with 490 cells of clone 28\u201377 per well.

When 10 cells of clone H10 were seeded together with an excess of clone 28\u201377, foci of infected cells were clearly distinguishable and the number of foci was below 10, fitting with the assumption that reporter virus would focally adhere at sites where H10 cells had been sedimented before (Fig. 5B).",

After washing and the addition of indicator fibroblasts and further incubation for two days, cultures were screened for GFP-expressing cells with a fluorescence microscope and the number of infectious foci was counted (Fig. 7\n). Expectedly, the number of visible footprints increased with the number of H10 hybridoma cells per well. The probability that seeded hybridoma cells would form a focus of infected cells was around 50% at all concentrations, i.e. seeding of 5 hybridoma cells reliably resulted in the formation of 2\u20133 foci in three repeated experiments. Even if only a single H10 cell was seeded among 500 28\u201377 cells, a focus was detected in 1 out of 3 experiments. This indicates that the assay is suitable for the detection of HCMV surface antigen-specific specific B-cells in a cell mixture. For example, if only 1 out of 10,000 B-cells of a donor is directed against an envelope protein of HCMV and 100,000 cells are screened (= 200 wells, each containing 500 cells), the probability of finding HCMV-specific B-cells can be calculated as >99%. This is easily feasible with this assay.",

Therefore, the screening and selection process is a crucial step to identify antigen-specific B-cells from the whole B-cell repertoire of seropositive humans or immunized mice in a limited time, particularly when looking for B-cells secreting antibodies targeting complex discontinuous epitopes on viral surface antigens. Functional assays such as a microneutralization assay are useful and contribute to the isolation of potent neutralizing antibodies against HCMV (Macagno et al., 2010). Alternatively to performing neutralization assays, which may require high amounts of purified antibodies, B-cells or cell-culture supernatants can be screened for antigen binding. Conventional ELISA assays are well established for routine diagnostics and usually based on purified viral antigens (Liermann et al., 2014). High throughput screening techniques based on antigen microarrays were developed to facilitate the screening process (De Masi et al., 2005; Tickle et al., 2015). These methods allow for the simultaneous screening of B-cells for antibody specificity to one particular antigen or to several antigens. However, since these assays are based on purified recombinant peptides or proteins, they are inadequate to detect neutralizing antibodies targeting complex surface-antigen epitopes.",

Accordingly, Dengue virus (DENV) immune serum depletion studies have shown that the antibodies responsible for serum neutralizing activity following primary DENV infection target complex epitopes that exist in a correct conformational state only on the virion particle, but not on recombinant soluble forms of the viral surface antigen E (Smith et al., 2014).

            "text": "When working with herpesviruses such as HSV or HCMV, one should keep in mind that these viruses can bind antibodies via viral Fc-receptors (Atalay et al., 2002; Ndjamen et al., 2016; Sprague et al., 2006). The interaction between the viral Fc-receptors and immunoglobulins is species-specific. IgGs from humans exhibit stronger binding to the HSV-FcR and HCMV-FcR than mouse IgGs (Antonsson and Johansson, 2001; Johansson et al., 1985). The Fc-related unspecific binding can be eliminated by using an Fc-receptor-lacking virus or by blocking the viral Fc-receptors with human Fc-fragments or sera from seronegative donors. The HSV-1 Fc-receptor consisting of the glycoprotein dimer gE/gI is well characterized, and a gE-deletion mutant lacking the viral Fc-receptor is available (Farnsworth et al., 2003). In the present study we worked with the HSV-1 \u0394gE mutant to exclude unspecific binding related to the HSV-1 Fc-receptor. There was no significant unspecific binding observed when using a human antibody not specific for HSV-1, indicating that the assay is reliable for detecting virus-specific antibodies in particular. Since there are a number of HCMV proteins described that can bind the human IgG-Fc-domain, and no appropriate deletion mutant was available, we decided to use an HCMV-GFP reporter virus. Although we could not observe any background related to HCMV-receptor binding of HCMV-unspecific antibodies in our study, such binding can easily be inhibited by pre-incubation of the reporter virus with human Fc-fragments as previously described (Antonsson and Johansson, 2001) when indicated. A critical point for identifying HSV or HCMV specific antibodies with the assays described here might be the antibody affinity. Cells secreting low-affinity HSV or HCMV specific may induce only weak signals and thus remain undetected. However, we know from the HIV, HSV or influenza field, that the best neutralizing antibodies bind the target antigens with a high affinity, at least at nanomolar range (see e.g. (Mascola and Haynes, 2013)). The assays described here were developed to support the identification of novel, highly neutralizing antibodies that can be further developed for clinical use. In line with prior studies, we expect that such antibodies will bind the target antigens with a high affinity. The affinity of the HSV-1 specific mAbs 2c and hu2c used in this study are at nanomolar range (Krawczyk et al., 2013). The affinity of the HCMV-specific IgG 8 J16 could not yet be determined, but based on a prior study we estimate that it is also in the nanomolar range (Macagno et al., 2010). Therefore, we conclude that the methods described in the manuscript are suitable for the detection of high-affinity antibodies targeting HSV or HCMV.",

After a positive selection of high-affinity binders, the newly identified antibodies need to be further characterized for potent virus neutralization to select potential candidates for clinical use. These methods described here may facilitate the screening procedure of B-cells specific for HSV and HCMV surface antigens, including those targeting highly complex epitope structures, and contribute towards identifying novel potent antibodies against HSV and HCMV.",
