            "text": "In 1967, Ashbaugh and colleagues first described a respiratory distress syndrome in 12 patients with acute onset of tachypnea, refractory hypoxemia, loss of lung compliance, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR) [1]. They noted that these patients had features similar to infantile respiratory distress syndrome, and that they did not respond to standard treatment. Over the years, many different definitions for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have been proposed, with the American European Consensus Conference (AECC) most commonly used in the past and the Berlin definition (Table 26.1) being the most commonly used presently. The Berlin definition of ARDS was published in 2012 and was endorsed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) [2]. They defined ARDS as new or worsening respiratory symptoms within 1 week of clinical insult with bilateral opacities on CXR (Fig. 26.1) or computerized tomography (CT) scan (Fig. 26.2), not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. They further classified ARDS into three categories (Table 26.2) based on the arterial oxygen tension: fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) and with a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. The Berlin definition is notably different from prior definitions in that it recognizes that a CT scan can be used in lieu of a chest radiograph, acknowledges that diagnosis can occur in the presence of cardiac failure, and includes a minimum PEEP of 5 cm H2O (or CPAP for mild ARDS). The Berlin definition simplifies the prior definition by removing the classification of acute lung injury (ALI) and instead utilizing mild, moderate, and severe ARDS classifications. These classifications remain important to the definition of ARDS due to differences in mortality, as well as treatment options.\n\n\n\n",

The Acute Lung Injury: Epidemiology and Natural history (ALIEN) study evaluated patient data from Spain and estimated an incidence of 7.2/100,000 population/year and an ICU mortality of 42% despite lung protective ventilation [3]. A broader study, which looked at 459 ICUs across 50 different countries, concluded that ARDS represented 10.4% of total ICU admissions and 23.4% of all patients on mechanical ventilation [4]. They also noted that ARDS continues to be underdiagnosed, with only 60% of patients qualifying for ARDS under the Berlin definition being recognized by clinicians.",

            "text": "Aside from lung injury, it has been hypothesized that genetic predisposition may increase the risk for developing ARDS. Although no single gene has been identified as a culprit, over 40 genes have been associated with ARDS. These include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), epidermal growth factor (EGF), factor V, IL6, IL8, IL10, surfactant protein B, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), and Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) [6] among others. ACE has the clearest association with ARDS, which came into light when ACE2 was identified in in vitro studies as a potential receptor for the coronavirus that caused SARS [7]. This was confirmed by showing that ACE2 expression in cells that initially were not susceptible to the SARS infection would allow entry of the virus into the cell [8]. This has led to the possibility of recombinant ACE2 protein as a potential treatment for preventing the spread of SARS and protecting infected patients from worsening lung failure. Studies are also being conducted to better define the role of ACE2 in other emerging lung infections such as avian influenza A.",

The exudative phase occurs within 1\u20137 days after the initial insult to the lung. The initial insult may be a direct insult to the alveolar epithelium (pneumonia) or an indirect insult such as pancreatitis. This phase is characterized by immune cell-mediated damage of the alveolar capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells. The result is a loss of the alveolar barrier and accumulation of protein-rich edema with the formation of a protein-rich hyaline membrane. Alveolar M1 macrophages secrete cytokines (IL-1, 6, 8, and 10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and lipid mediators. In response to these pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils are recruited to the area [9] as well as activation of alveolar epithelial cells and effector T-cells, which leads to sustained inflammation and tissue injury [10]. The resulting inflammatory exudate directly affects type II alveolar cells, leading to inactivation of surfactant and impairment of alveolar function. This cascade of injuries and decreased pulmonary compliance leads to worsening gas exchange, increasing ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, and refractory hypoxia which can be further worsened by mechanical stretch injury.",

One of the most influential studies, and one from which much of our current strategy for lung protective ventilation comes from, is the landmark ventilation with lower tidal volumes as compared to traditional tidal volumes for acute lung injury and ARDS (ARMA) study which was published by the ARDSnet group in 2000 [12].",

The study was stopped early due to an 8% reduction of mortality in the low tidal volume ventilation group (31% vs 38.8%). This led to the belief that higher tidal volume ventilation can lead to worsening pulmonary edema due to alveolar overdistention, which can cause additional damage to the endothelial and epithelial lining, and promote a pro-inflammatory cascade [13]. While the high tidal volume group in this study was significantly higher than typically used, this study offers evidence showing that mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes has a reduction in mortality.",

This results in a small portion of lung that must fulfill the ventilation requirements of the individual. Research by Amato and colleagues [21] uses this concept to suggest that tidal volumes based on ideal body weight (IBW) is a reflection of the lung volume of healthy individuals and does not take into account that the functional lung of a patient with ARDS is significantly reduced (baby lung). They suggest that taking into account the lower respiratory-system compliance (CRS) of the functional lung as a ratio of the lung volume based on IBW (VT) provides a better prediction for outcomes. They define this ratio as the driving pressure (\u0394P = VT/CRS), which can be calculated at the bedside as the plateau pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure (Pplat \u2212 PEEP). They reviewed 3500 patients from nine different trials and concluded that there was a higher mortality rate associated with patients with higher driving pressures. They also noted that the protective benefits of higher PEEP were only seen when it was associated with lower driving pressures. Their analysis suggests that driving pressures above 15 cm H2O may increase mortality. There are ongoing trials evaluating the benefit of reduced driving pressures in ARDS patients.",

The trial utilized prone positioning for a minimum of 16 consecutive hours per day. Placing a patient in prone position reduces the pleural pressure gradient from nondependent to dependent regions and allows for a more homogeneous distribution of aeration and strain from dorsal to ventral areas of the lung, thus protecting the lung from ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and allowing for improved VQ matching. Absolute contraindications to prone positioning include, but are not limited to: pregnancy, spinal instability, increased intracranial pressure, shock, anterior burns, and chest tubes.
