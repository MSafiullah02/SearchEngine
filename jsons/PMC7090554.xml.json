HIV/AIDS affected over 35 million people globally, and Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region with approximately 68 % people affected (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_HIV/AIDS#Sub-Saharan_Africa). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is currently the most effective therapeutic regimen decreasing the viral load, which prolongs the survival of AID-free patients [4, 40, 58]. These drugs include inhibitors of three essential HIV enzymes protease, integrase (IN), reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as entry and progression enzyme inhibitors of in the HIV life cycle [11, 41]. In spite of all currently existing anti-HIV therapies, resistant strains still poses a problem. This creates a demanding necessity for the identification of new antivirals that do not induce drug resistance.",

            "text": "Hsp90 is an ATP dependent chaperone protein crucial for maintaining active forms of other proteins which are known as client proteins [28]. Hsp90 has also been reported to be responsible for the replication of nearly all kinds of viruses such as DNA, RNA viruses, and double-stranded RNA viruses [23]. Hsp90 is a large protein, forming a homodimeric complex. Each monomer shares a common domain organization which consists of a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), a middle domain (MD) and an N-terminal ATPase domain (NTD) (Fig. 1), which is found mostly in almost every part of eukaryotic cells [15, 35, 46]. Amongst other proteins, Hsp90 is one of the most profuse proteins in the cytoplasm, where it makes up approximately 1\u20132 % of the total protein levels (Anon n.d.). It is responsible for the controls of activities, such as the maturation, localization of a selected large number of substrates called \u201cclient proteins\u201d in the cytoplasm. These clients proteins are part of several processes including transcription, translation, mitochondrial function, kinetochore assembly, inflammation, immunology, cellular antiviral defense pathways, apoptosis, centrosome function and cell cycle [18, 30, 39]. Studies have demonstrated that the replication of viruses to be sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors at very low concentrations without affecting cellular viability, due to their dependence in Hsp90 for their survival. Hsp90 is regarded as an essential protein for malignant transformation and progression, thus target protein for anti-cancer drugs [45, 54]. A previous study in our laboratory gave a computational perspective of Hsp90 as an anti-cancer target [36]. Recently it has been reported as a potential target for anti-HIV therapy [60].\n",

            "text": "Molecular dynamic simulations and post-dynamics (PD) analysis appeared as the closest methods to the actual experimental work and is of great help in the understanding of the complex biological phenomenas [12]. An application of continuous MD simulations to reveal folding and the unfolding activities of biological enzymes has made it convenient to fathom the dimerization process complexity of macromolecules [8, 20, 25, 37, 55]. The heightened utilities of the PD methods demonstrated to be effectual in comprehending the conformational background of biological macromolecules. The most extensively improved PD methodologies used to seek structural variations within distinctive biological phenomenas include principal component analysis PCA or essential dynamics (ED) [11]. Although PCA has attested its competency to be implement in the likening of motions of different macromolecules there are additional techniques, which were applied to understand such biological conformational behaviors [9, 49]. Such may include dynamic cross-correlation (DCC), which was valuable to gain insights on macromolecular motions in different biological systems [22]. To understand both the dimerization and the inhibition processes of Hsp90, virtual MD simulations were employed for the bound and the unbound conformations. To our understanding, this is the first report of such adequate computational insight on Hsp90 as a vital HIV target. Thus, we trust that this account aids as a significant computational study towards an improved understanding of the Hsp90 protein structure, dynamics and its mechanism of inhibition. Herein, we presented the structural and dynamic insight that can be executed in the discovery of drugs and the development of more effective HIV inhibitors against Hsp90.",

The ff99sb force field [19] applied with Amber 14 was employed in the description of the protein systems. To neutralize the system, missing hydrogen atoms and counter ions were added using the Leap module, integrated with Amber 14. All the systems were submerged into an orthorhombic box with TIP3P [29] water molecules in a manner that none of the protein atoms were contained in 12 \u00c5 of any box edge prior to the set up. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) [27] technique was employed to calculate the continuous electrostatic interactions and van de Waals cut-off of 12 \u00c5. Initial system minimization for 500 steps using steepest descent was followed by 100,000 steps using conjugate gradients algorithm was performed to relax the system and remove all unfavorable clashes. CPU version of Amber14 was used to perform all the minimization but before the minimization step, a gradual heating from 0 to 300 K by means of Langevin thermostat [62] with a collision frequency of 1/ps using an official ensemble (NVT) was used. All systems were successively equilibrated at 300 K in a NPT ensemble for 100,000 ps with no restrained and to uphold the pressure at 1 bar Berendsen barostat [10] was used. To restrict the bonds of all covalently bonded atoms to hydrogen atoms for all MD simulations runs the SHAKE algorithm [34] was used. The MD was run continuously in a NPT ensemble for 100 ns with a target pressure of 1 bar and a pressure-coupling constant of 2 ps. In every 1 ps the trajectories were examined and more analyses namely RMSD, RMSF, Rg, inter atomic distances, DCC and PCA were performed using PTRAJ and CPPTRAJ modules intergrated in Amber 14. All plots and visualization were performed in Chimera molecular modeling tool [47] and Origin data analysis software (www.originlab.com) respectively.",
