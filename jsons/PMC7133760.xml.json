Integral to healthcare education, simulation training ensures familiarity prior to patient care, providing a safe environment for \u2018deliberate practice\u2019 of procedural skills, communication and teamwork, and management of medical emergencies [14]. An example of simulation that has expanded greatly in recent years is the use of ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence markers, well established as a means of assessing compliance with hand hygiene, but also for assessing contamination of the environment and equipment [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Their value in assessing PPE and user competence, especially for HCID pathogens, is increasingly recognized, with visualization of cross-contamination providing strong and instant feedback to users. However, these studies have low numbers of participants. The lack of clear evidence for PPE components and training methods required for their correct use and doffing was concluded in a Cochrane review, which called for higher-powered studies to address both issues [23].",

A range of commercially available UV markers was evaluated; those selected were ideally transparent or colourless under normal lighting conditions, but clearly visible under UV light with a range of distinguishable colours. The strength of fluorescence, effect of combining with other fluids, and compatibility with PPE material and colours were taken into consideration. The intention was to create a reasonable representation of the bodily fluids in terms of method of transfer and quantity of contamination for the purposes of the scenario, with the simulant fluids and delivery mechanisms designed as follows:\u2013Vomit: This was created using the mechanism from \u2018Vomiting Larry\u2019, a pneumatic system designed to simulate projectile vomiting in norovirus infection (Figure 1\na) [17]. A blue UV tracer (Tinopal CBS-X) was incorporated into water, in this case with a volume of 800 mL to reflect estimated maximal human vomit [26]. The liquid chamber and piston-driven delivery mechanism from \u2018Larry\u2019 was connected into the mannequin via a pipe through the back of the head to her mouth (Figure 2\na); this allowed her to vomit when the piston was triggered remotely.\u2013Diarrhoea: A flour-, water- and salt-based mixture was used to mimic type 7 on the \u2018Bristol stool scale\u2019, to which a yellow UV tracer (UV Gear Ltd, Reigate, UK) was added [27]. A representative volume was placed in the mannequin's underwear and incontinence pad before each simulation exercise started.\u2013Sweat: Glycerol was considered a suitable simulant for sweat, mixed with an orange UV tracer (UV Gear Ltd) and manually applied to the skin of the mannequin immediately before starting each exercise. Although the viscosity differs from that of human sweat, it was acceptable for the purpose of this exercise, staying in place after application without \u2018pooling\u2019 or dripping off, yet transferring well on contact as determined by prior testing.\u2013Cough: Both aerosol and droplet spread of particles are potential routes of respiratory infection transmission such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and so the aim was to replicate both [3]. Advice was sought from an aerosol physicist about cough velocity, droplet/aerosol mix and spread, concluding that a commercially available artist's airbrush delivered an acceptable simulation, and could be adapted to fit into the mannequin's lower jaw (Figure 2b). A similar approach has previously been used to mimic a cough/sneeze in respiratory protection challenge studies using a breathing mannequin [28]. The airbrush reservoir was filled with an aqueous solution of a red UV tracer (UV Gear Limited) and activated remotely to spray into the zone the healthcare worker would enter during the patient care scenario.\n",

However, their use is technically more complex and lacks instant visual results. For example, using UV markers facilitated timely, simple and comprehensive screening of equipment, identifying unexpected cross-contamination such as glove boxes. This would not have been possible in near-real-time with a viral surrogate. Reassuringly, work using both methods showed no difference in rates of contamination events on healthcare workers, suggesting that both are suitable for PPE assessment. Furthermore, in the absence of minimum infecting dose of HCID pathogens through cross-contamination, presence or absence of contamination is the valid basis of safety assessment [6], [20], [38]. Using qualitative fluorescent markers therefore provides an evidence base for real-time training.",
