Thus, in this review we present an overview of the preparation for the Hajj as an example of a mass gathering.

IT plays an essential and important role in the success of the pilgrimage season in many ways, most notably by providing a robust medium that transfers and analyzes data in a timely manner to prepare accurate statistics, which facilitates appropriate decision-making. A centralized and dedicated data center was built to eliminate the process of connecting to different sites in order to obtain the data needed for the Hajj operation team. The first step in gathering and sending data to the Hajj operation team at the command center involves the end-user stations. Therefore, major local area network (LAN) projects were implemented to connect all end-user stations with both wired and wireless connections to the data center. These projects included all the hospitals and medical centers at the Holy sites (Mena, Arafat, and Mozdalefah). Due to constant connectivity problems related to the service provider, a major wireless wide area network project was started in 2011 to cover all participating hospitals, medical centers, and directorates in both Makkah and Madina cities. The new network is owned by the Ministry of Health and has various connection speeds \u2013 starting from 54 MB and going up to 1.2 GB \u2013 depending on each site's criticality and workload.",

To simplify data gathering at the primary medical center, the use of digital pens was implemented in 2012 for the transformation of conventional forms into digital forms that provide demographic and medical data in a timely fashion. The system was enhanced in 2013, adding dressing and observation forms, and was also implemented in the outpatient departments of two hospitals (Mena Emergency Hospital and Jabil Arrahma Hospital). Figure 3\ndepicts an example of the data produced using digital pens to monitor the categories of diagnoses for patients visiting primary care clinics during the Hajj. Database-level integration with both statistics and the Hajj System was achieved and data smoothly transferred from the digital pen system to the other two systems.

The most common viral respiratory tract infections are influenza and rhinovirus.17 The estimated incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) during the Hajj ranges from 20% to 80%, depending on the type of method used to confirm the diagnosis.15 During the 2009 Hajj season, the emergence of pandemic H1N1 was of great concern. There was no increased risk of this virus during the Hajj season.17 A cohort survey was conducted in collaboration between France and Saudi Arabia during the Hajj 2012.18, 19 Participants were followed up and sampled before departing from France to the KSA, during their pilgrimage in the KSA, and just before leaving the KSA.18, 19 Nasal swabs were collected from participants and tested for 11 respiratory viruses and four bacteria by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Of 165 participants who had nasal swabs collected before departing to the KSA, eight (4.8%) were positive for one virus or more, including rhinovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus, and 7.3% had Streptococcus pneumoniae.18, 19 Among symptomatic pilgrims, 27 (38.6%) were positive for one or more viruses.18 The rate of S. pneumoniae carriage was 7.1% in the country of origin and 19.5% before departing from the KSA.19 These data indicate the risk of acquiring respiratory tract infections during the Hajj and the potential for the spread of the acquired organisms upon returning home.18, 19\n",

In addition, member states should support the efforts of the KSA MoH in making health-related advice available to all travelers departing for Umra or Hajj by working with the travel and tourism sectors and placing such materials at strategic locations. Various strategies for the communication of the health recommendations should be utilized, including pamphlets and radio and television programs.37 In their guidance to countries, the WHO stressed the enforcement of the recommendation that pilgrims who develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough (severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities) during Umra or Hajj, or after return to their country of origin, should report to the medical health facility closest to them and cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing and wash hands afterwards, or if this is not possible, cough or sneeze into the upper sleeves of their clothing; further they should avoid attending crowded places and preferably isolate themselves until the end of the respiratory symptoms and, if isolation is not possible, use a tissue to cover the nose and mouth or a surgical mask when in crowded places.",

This has been applied to Ebola this year, with a restriction on pilgrims from countries where outbreaks of Ebola are ongoing, such as Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak was initially reported from Guinea, including the capital city of Conakry, and then in March 30, 2014, cases were reported in the district of Foya in neighboring Liberia; in May 2014, the first cases were identified in Sierra Leone.38 On August 8, 2014 the World Health Organization declared that the epidemic of ebola to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In addition, the recent polio outbreak in Pakistan and Syria and the WHO International Health Regulation Emergency Committee recommendations have been enforced. Recently, Brazil was exposed to a poliovirus importation with no evidence of transmission and thus no additional measures were needed for travelers.39\n",
