This link was eloquently documented by German pathologist Rudolf Carl Virchow, investigating an outbreak of typhus in the nineteenth century:The population had no idea that the mental and material impoverishment to which it had been allowed to sink, were largely the cause of its hunger and disease, and that the adverse climatic conditions which contributed to the failure of its crops and to the sickness of its bodies, would have not caused such terrible ravages, if it had been free, educated and well-to-do. For there can now no longer be any doubt that such an epidemic dissemination of typhus had only been possible under the wretched conditions of life that poverty and lack of culture had created in Upper Silesia. If these conditions were removed, I am sure that epidemic typhus would not recur. Whosoever wishes to learn from history will find many examples.4\n",

In early December 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity Mortality and Weekly Report announced that the outbreak had spread nationwide. At that time, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) reported 91,770 cases of cholera, including 43,243 hospitalizations and 2071 deaths.

However, a narrative that uses phrases such as medical and natural implies inevitability and general inculpability. A more careful reading of the context in which the cholera outbreak has occurred proves such ahistorical views misleading.",

After more than a decade of war that destroyed the country\u2019s infrastructure and cost tens of thousands of lives, the French relinquished military control in 1804. However, France maintained financial repression by demanding that the fledgling nation pay damages for property losses incurred during the revolution. These demands marked the birth of Haiti\u2019s longstanding debt burden. As historian von Tunzelmann6 describes, Haiti was on the brink of humanitarian calamity even before the devastating earthquake of 2010:\u2026 France gained the western third of the island of Hispaniola\u2014the territory that is now Haiti\u2014in 1697. It planted sugar and coffee, supported by an unprecedented increase in the importation of African slaves. Economically, the result was a success, but life as a slave was intolerable\u2026After a dramatic slave uprising that shook the western world, and 12 years of war, Haiti finally defeated Napoleon\u2019s forces in 1804 and declared independence. But France demanded reparations: 150 [million] francs, in gold.For Haiti, this debt did not signify the beginning of freedom, but the end of hope\u2026 By 1900, it was spending 80% of its national budget on repayments. To manage the original reparations, further loans were taken out\u2014mostly from the United States, Germany and France. Instead of developing its potential, this deformed state produced a parade of nefarious leaders, most of whom gave up the insurmountable task of trying to fix the country and looted it instead.\n",

It was in the context of hundreds of thousands of people living in refugee camps (1 million on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince alone) with intermittent access to drinking water and gross underprovision of sanitation facilities that cholera took hold.11 Recent findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine and using third-generation single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing found that the clonal strain causing the Haiti outbreak was genetically similar to those previously isolated in Bangladesh. The study investigators concluded that, \u201cCollectively, our data strongly suggest that the Haitian epidemic began with introduction of a V. cholerae strain into Haiti by human activity from a distant geographic source.\u201d12 These results corroborated those from the CDC and the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) in Haiti.13 The initial CDC findings were released in early November and sparked protests against the Nepali UN peacekeepers quartered near the river presumed to be the source of the outbreak. At least 3 Haitians were killed.14 After a 100-year hiatus, cholera has now gripped Haiti and has started to spread to the Dominican Republic.15 Given the increased virulence associated with this particular strain (the death rate in Haiti is 12 times higher than that of the 1991 Peruvian epidemic) there are calls from public health leaders to mass vaccinate the populations of the island and its closest neighbors.16 Taking into account the long view of Haiti\u2019s history, from slavery to colonialism, debt, despotic leaders, and a woeful undersupply of public goods, the cholera outbreak seems less like an unforeseen catastrophe and more like an event that Virchow would have easily predicted.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), NTDs are defined by their association with poverty: \u201cthough medically diverse, neglected tropical diseases form a group because all are associated with poverty.\u201d17 Substandard housing, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, and inadequate vector control contribute to the efficient transmission of infection. Currently, of the world\u2019s 2.7 billion impoverished individuals, more than a billion people suffer from NTDs.17 Thankfully, there is growing attention to this matter among the international community. The first annual report on NTDs was released by the WHO in 2010. Director-General Margaret Chan refers to the MDGs in her preface and provides several examples of how eliminating NTDs would foster economic development: \u201cOnchocerciasis and trachoma cause blindness. Leprosy and lymphatic filariasis deform in ways that hinder economic productivity and cancel out chances for a normal social life. Buruli ulcer maims\u2026Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) severely debilitates before it kills. Chagas disease can cause young adults to develop heart conditions, so that they fill hospital beds instead of the labor force,\u201d and so on.17 The emphasis on potential negative productivity implications associated with untreated NTDs is understandable. Like cancer and heart disease, NTDs do not travel widely. New justifications are needed to persuade the international community to intervene when the direct threat to the health of wealthy country inhabitants is muted. If the medical community is to be committed to global health equity and not simply to reducing morbidity or mortality from the cluster of diseases that most affect the wealthy world, a rights-based approach to health care must be adopted.",

In Aiding Violence, he summarizes:[A]id financed much of the machinery of exclusion, inequality, and humiliation; provided it with legitimacy and support; and sometimes directly contributed to it. To their credit, some aid agencies\u2014some nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) foremost among them\u2014may have had different impacts; they may have softened some parts of the crises faced by ordinary Rwandans.

            "text": "There is a strong association between child survival and fertility. Total fertility rate (TFR; the number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance with current age-specific fertility rates) and mortality before 5 years of age (child mortality rate [CMR], the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby will die before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to current age-specific mortality) have a correlation coefficient of 0.876. Table 1\nshows the linear trend between these indicators.10 Explanations abound as to why the relationship between child survival and fertility are so robust. One view espoused by many demographers and economists is that families in societies where child survival is low tend to compensate for expected and actual child deaths by having more children. Nobel laureate and economist Gary Becker famously modeled this quality/quantity trade-off with respect to family size. Another explanation is that places with high child mortality also lack access to contraception, educational opportunities for women, and gender equality. Although desired family size is a difficult concept to define and measure, the World Bank does attempt to collect data on access to contraception and indices of gender inequality.10 Although the correlation between the gender inequality index and child mortality in the World Bank\u2019s indicators database is negligible (0.01), perhaps at least in part because of the small sample size (75 countries) and imprecise measuring, contraceptive prevalence is negatively correlated with child mortality (\u22120.32). Although a major focus of academic inquiry is the direction of causality in the fertility-CMR relation, it seems safe to assume that the relationship is bidirectional. These data imply that efforts to improve public health through the provision of either culturally appropriate family planning or pediatric care would also pay dividends in the other health sector. From an economic standpoint, household resources are divided among fewer individuals as family size shrinks. This division allows parents to invest more in their children\u2019s education and nutrition, potentially interrupting the intergenerational transmission of poverty.",

            "text": "As with the relationship between child survival and fertility, the interplay between health and education is complex. As mentioned earlier, more-educated mothers tend to have fewer and healthier children. Moreover, the returns from education in terms of increased wages or agricultural output give heads of households the financial opportunity to promote their own health and that of their children. David Barker, a British physician who noted a correlation between low birth weight and cardiovascular health in midlife, put forward the fetal origins hypothesis that the in utero environment has important consequences for health and cognitive abilities later in life. Several epidemiologists have since confirmed this association.26 Almond,27 an economist at Columbia, used the natural experiment of the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic to assess the impact of fetal health on educational and labor outcomes. Pairing data from the pandemic with those from the 1960 to 1980 decennial US censuses, Almond27 found that cohorts in utero during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, and lower socioeconomic status compared with other birth cohorts. Similarly, Miguel and Kremer28 analyzed a randomized control trial of deworming in Kenyan schools at the facility level designed to capture the positive externalities associated with reducing the transmission of helminths. Miguel and Kremer28 found that the program reduced absenteeism from school by one-quarter, although there was no significant effect on test scores. A series of follow-up studies have shown that those who received deworming for a longer period of time enjoy higher wages years later. Taken together, these results suggest that health investments, especially early in life, affect educational attainment.",

            "text": "There is perhaps an even more subtle way in which health affects education and economic outcomes: through the channel of savings and investment. Economic growth theory has repeatedly underscored that savings and investment are engines of development,29 but what explains why some countries invest more than others? This question was first posed by John Rae writing in the early nineteenth century. As Frederick and colleagues30 explain, \u201cLike [his contemporary] Adam Smith, Rae sought to determine why wealth differed among nations. Smith had argued that national wealth was determined by the amount of labor allocated to the production of capital, but Rae recognized that this account was incomplete because it failed to explain the determinants of this allocation. In Rae\u2019s view, the missing factor was \u2018the effective desire of accumulation,\u201d which determines the \u201crate of time preference.\u201d The rate of time preference is a mathematical representation of the tendency individuals have to weight the present more heavily than the future when making decisions. It summarizes how willing consumers are to delay immediate consumption and instead invest or save their income.30 Thus, the relationship between the rate of time preference and savings behavior at the individual level can be linked to income growth and disparities at the aggregate level. Studies by psychologists and economists have shown that the poor discount the future more steeply than the wealthy.31 This result has given rise to the view that the poor are impatient or, more pejoratively, lack self-control. However, this rationale fails to account for the uncertainty and risks associated with living in poverty. In particular, how do health status and expectation of longevity influence one\u2019s willingness to make trade-offs over time? Recent evidence from Sri Lanka sheds light on this question. Jayachandra and Lleras-Muney32 examined how a sudden drop in maternal mortality between 1946 and 1953 sharply increased the life expectancy of girls. This increase in turn led to greater investment in their education: Jayachandra and Lleras-Muney32 found that, for every extra year of life expectancy, literacy among girls increased by 0.7 percentage points (2%) and years of education increased by 0.11 years (3%). At Partners In Health, we often use the phrase antidote to despair to describe our work. Translating the language of social justice into the language of economics, the antidote is the extended time horizon afforded by longevity. Knowing that a healthy and well-fed tomorrow awaits may affect the psychology of those living in poverty. The impact of this health-led hope on investments in microenterprise, education, and complementary health inputs has yet to be fully measured.",

As shown by disease patterns in Haiti and Rwanda, social forces interact with human biology and affect who falls ill and who has access to care. Thus, use of a biosocial analytical framework provides a useful and effective tool for designing and implementing health interventions to address these inequalities. Failure to use a biosocial lens often gives rise to charity and development models of health intervention that replicate preexisting unequal structures. Such models localize blame for disease with the poor themselves. In contrast, a biosocial lens makes clear that disease among the poor results from the embodiment of structural violence and requires that any serious attempt to address disease in resource-poor settings incorporates efforts for social change. Through commitment to models built on the principles of social justice, we have found that advocacy and long-term partnerships with the public sector and the communities in which we work are indispensable to sustainable transformations in health that reduce suffering caused by infectious and chronic disease.",

In Haiti, Rwanda, and numerous other settings, Partners In Health and local partners provide care that integrates social and economic programs. These programs include constructing homes and schools, establishing potable water systems, and providing food and transportation stipends. In addition, paid community health workers are used to deliver top-quality health care to patients in their homes, rather than requiring sick, impoverished individuals to confront innumerable barriers to reaching clinics and hospitals. Such solutions, which privilege a biosocial approach to identifying and breaking down barriers to care, have resulted in remarkable successes in addressing epidemics of HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, and other communicable and chronic diseases in some of the most challenging domestic and global settings.33\n",

Although there is ample evidence that heath investments pay dividends in labor productivity, educational attainment, population control, and, potentially, capital investments, the idea that health is an instrument for development should complement, not supplant, a rights-based approach to health equity. It is plausible that most health interventions in resource-poor settings could garner support based on cost/benefit ratios with appropriately lengthy time horizons to capture the return on health investments and an adequate accounting of externalities; however, such a calculus masks the untold suffering of inaction and risks eroding the most powerful incentive to act: redressing inequality.",
