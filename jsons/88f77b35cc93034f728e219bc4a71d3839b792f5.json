According to Bauer (1960) , perceived risk is the subjectively discerned risk in a situation where customers need to make a choice for a brand, store, and way of purchase. In other words, perceived risk comes from uncertainty of a decision's outcome. Therefore, the customer's purchase and selection decision can result in unpredicted results and sometimes leads to negative consequences because of the uncertainty (Assael 1995) . Cox (1967) stated that perceived risk is subject to intrinsic risk and its quantity, and it is perceived because customers cannot be confident that their decisions would accomplish the goal of purchase. Engel and Blackwell (1983) defined perceived risk as the amount of risk involved in the purchase of a product, and Assael (1995) described it as a dilemma between the desire to purchase and an uncertain loss from the purchase. On the other hand, Gartner (1989) considered perceived risk as the expected loss and its negative effect as a result of selection.

Travelers usually have different responses about their travel experience, and the level of satisfaction might also be different even though they had the same travel. Research on customer satisfaction has generally been done based on the expectation-performance inconsistency theory of Oliver (1980) , focusing on theoretically critical factors of satisfaction. In this theory, customer satisfaction can be evaluated by the difference between expectation and performance. The expectation-performance inconsistency approach has been widely used in studies on travelers' satisfaction (Sonmez and Graefe 1998) . In this light, the level of perceived risk before travel can be seen as a gap between expectation and the level of perceived performance, on the basis of which travel satisfaction can be evaluated (Raaij and Francken 1984) . Oliver and Bearden (1985) argued that there is a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and repurchase intention and this relationship is nonlinear. Cronin and Taylor (1992) stated that customer satisfaction has a high level of relationship with repurchase intention regarding fast food, bank, and laundry services. In a tourism context, Tian (1998) showed that a travelers' satisfaction of the overall service quality directly affects repurchase intention and future travel behavior.
