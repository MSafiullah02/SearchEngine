The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently wrote, \"Given their congregate nature and residents served (eg, older adults often with underlying chronic medical conditions), nursing home populations are at the highest risk of being affected by COVID-19. If infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, residents are at increased risk of serious illness.\" 1 However, in the United States and many other countries, nursing homes are not the only congregate setting that serves older adults with underlying chronic medical conditions. More so, they have been a shrinking component of the residential long-term care system, with some of the largest growth having been in assisted living (AL). AL communities provide supportive care, at least 2 meals a day, and 24hour supervision to individuals who need daily supportive care, but not daily nursing care. 2, 3 Recent estimates are that there are 30,200 licensed AL communities across the United States, providing care to more than 835,000 residents 4 dwhich constitutes almost 40% of persons who receive residential long-term care in this country. More than half of the AL residents are \"old-old\" or \"oldest-old\": 53% are aged 85 or older, compared with 42% in nursing homes and 47% receiving hospice. 4 More so, many have the chronic underlying conditions implicated in COVID-19: 34% have heart disease, 17% have diabetes, and 15% have lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions), and more than a quarter have between 4 and 10 chronic health conditions. 5 Thus, the AL population is at high risk for being affected by COVID-19 and suffering serious outcomes.",

In those instances, AL staff may need to be more involved than usual to facilitate social contact, and to actually assume responsibility for doing so, especially for residents with cognitive or physical impairment. In addition, staff may need to help families and others connect through other means, such as sending letters and photographs, and perhaps dropping off special meals at the AL door. There have been anecdotal reports of families connecting with their relative from outside the community, such as a husband who celebrated his 67th wedding anniversary with his wife from outside her window 12 ; encouraging such engagement may be especially meaningful for family members as well.",
