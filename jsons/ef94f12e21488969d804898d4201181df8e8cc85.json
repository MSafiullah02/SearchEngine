In the 14th century, China lost half its population to the plague, which then spread to Europe, resulting in the deaths of approximately 75 million people [1] - [3] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2003, 3,098 people were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide and 774 died [4] , [5] . The number of deaths from the Hong Kong flu outbreak was 600 in 2017, with the total number of deaths being approximately twice the number of SARS deaths. Humans have always suffered from a variety of infectious diseases such as avian flu, swine flu, SARS, Ebola, and Zika. We still suffer not only from emergent infectious diseases but also recurring infectious diseases. Recent advances in medical technology have halted the spread of many infectious diseases through the development of appropriate vaccines. However, vaccine development requires a considerable amount of time.",

In 1994, the United States began providing infectious disease outbreak information for the first time through the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases mail (ProMED-mail) [14] , [15] . ProMED-mail sends infectious disease outbreak information via e-mail and is now available on the web. ProMED-mail procures information regarding infectious disease outbreaks by analyzing e-mails from its subscribers. It then filters this information through a review process, sends it to ProMED-mail subscribers via e-mail, and posts it on a website. On the website for ProMED-mail, users can retrieve infectious disease information by searching for keywords associated with an infectious disease, dates, or locations. ProMED-mail analyzes infectious disease information and presents the risk levels based on three colors of red, yellow, and green. Red indicates high risk, yellow indicates moderate risk, and green indicates low risk. The Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) is a disease information system developed in Canada in collaboration with the WHO in 1997 [16] , [17] . This system displays real-time data regarding various publichealth-related information and diseases. The GPHIN collects articles related to diseases from the web and analyzes them. The GPHIN then delivers filtered information to users via e-mail. When the e-mails are delivered, the GPHIN provides customized information according to pre-collected user preferences. Additionally, the system provides web search functionality, allowing users to view article information collected by the GPHIN. The Medical Information System (MedIsys) collects infectious disease information from media sources and analyzes it. Users can receive the analyzed information via e-mail or SMS by searching for keywords or selecting countries. Finally, GETWELL is a system that provides disease information utilizing the search engine of a medical website [18] . GETWELL stores queries from the search engine in its database with search dates, analyzes the queries, and sends the resulting information to users via e-mail.",

            "text": "There are also disease information systems that utilize methods for providing information regarding disease outbreaks on a map. Typical examples are HealthMap [23] , BioCaster [24] , Google Flu Trends [25] , [26] , FluNet [27] , and EpiSPIDER. HealthMap is a mutual disease information map based on the Google Maps API. HealthMap provides information regarding the occurrence of infectious diseases, primarily through geographic locations. This system collects infectious disease outbreak data in real time via Google, the news media, WHO, and infectious-disease-related websites. The filtered information includes the date of infectious disease outbreak, location where the infectious disease appeared, and other infectious disease information. The location of an outbreak is shown on a map. HealthMap calculates weights according to the date of occurrence, number of disease outbreaks, and location information, and it displays risk levels on a map. The aforementioned ProMED-mail also provides location information via the HealthMap in web-based systems. BioCaster also presents new keywords and information related to diseases filtered by month or week. Google Flu Trends analyzes influenza-related terms entered by users with regard to specific regions and then classifies influenza activity into five grades: intense, high, moderate, low, and minimal. The system then visualizes the grades on a map. Flunet is a web-based system implemented by the WHO to create a global influenza network. Flunet fetches weekly data from influenza centers in several countries, analyzes outbreak information, and fetches infectious disease information from national agencies and the media in real time. This system visualizes the risk of influenza in a country on a map. Finally, EpiSPIDER extracts subjects, dates, and location information related to diseases from data collected by news agencies and other sources. This system provides disease information for a year on a map. Some systems also chart disease outbreak information [28] - [30] . Fluview in the United States charts influenza outbreaks as a weekly chart of patient or death statistics, or charts outbreaks by age groups utilizing these data. The aforementioned HealthMap system presents infectious disease trends for one-year periods in the country where an infectious disease occurred when a user searches for the infectious disease. BioCaster in Japan visualizes the statistics of infectious disease outbreaks on a chart sorted by country. MedISys in Europe provides information in three classes, namely high, medium, and low, based on the order of the most frequent infectious diseases in each country. The statistics in this system are based on the number of articles related to infectious diseases. GETWELL in Sweden saves and analyzes queries from a search engine with dates and aggregates queries that are analyzed weekly. The aggregated results are listed on a web page as a graph. The system presents the graph as a time series graph for specific queries. Epidemic.co.kr in South Korea presents DiTex, which extracts important disease related topics from news media and SNS sources, presents weekly trends in the form of graphs, and visualizes topics utilizing World Cloud [31] . It also collects disease related data from news media SNS sources and analyzes characteristics of news and SNS data [32] . Flunet distinguishes influenza viruses as Virus A (H3N2), Virus A (H1N1), Virus B, etc. [33] . It also presents the numbers of outbreaks for each virus as a weekly bar graph. Finally, Europe's Influenzanet presents the outbreaks of each influenza-like illness as a line graph for each country [34] . One graph compares data from Influenzanet to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. This system allows users to predict outbreaks and compare outbreak rates across countries in Europe.",

Our system retrieves infectious disease statistics collected by the KCDC and stores them in our database. Our system visualizes the stored numerical data according to user requests. We implemented our system in the Eclipse Java EE Oxygen integrated development environment [35] . Eclipse is an open-source integrated development environment that supports various computer languages, including JAVA. We utilize JAVA [36] , [37] , HTML5 [38] , CSS [39] , and JQuery [40] in our system. First, we implemented our statistical program utilizing JAVA and created a layout that users can view on a web browser utilizing HTML5. We also applied styling to present charts on a web page utilizing CSS. We implemented asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) [41] data transfer via JQuery. On the server side, we utilize jetty-9.0.6 for our web server and Spring Framework 4 [42] for our application server. Jetty is a JAVA web server and JAVA servlet container. Spring Framework is an open-source application framework for supporting JAVA. This framework provides a variety of functions for dynamic implementation of websites. Our system utilizes the Spring Framework to interact with the database and store or retrieve data. The framework then responds to requests from the web server in an appropriate form. Finally, we utilize PostgreSQL 9.6 [43] , [44] for our database. Post-greSQL is an object-relational database management system. It supports SQL [45] standard and complex queries better than MYSQL [46] and has superior performance. Figure 1 presents the architecture of our system implemented in the development environment described above. Our system consists of a client, web server, application server, and database. The client accesses figures for infectious disease statistics utilizing the web browser through the following processes: (1) The client sends a request to the web server including parameters specifying the information the user wishes to retrieve. Currently, the request method is HTTP GET [47] . The web server provides a web page implemented in HTML when a user receives a service request. (2) After confirming if the data selected by the user are appropriate based on the request transmitted from the client, the web server transfers the request to the application server. The application server is responsible for executing the program or generating a query through the database connection and receiving data. (3) The application server in our system generates a query for the received request and sends it to the database. The application server then receives the query results from the database. (4) The database sends the query results to the web server. (5) Finally, the web server adds the data to the body of the HTTP response and responds to the client.",

Depending on the VOLUME 6, 2018 location of the district, the terrain and climate are different. In other words, the risk of infection for each infectious disease varies according to the characteristics of the district. In the Middle East, which has a desert-like climate, people encounter infectious diseases such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) and cholera. The outbreak of malaria in Korea was severe in Incheon, Gyeonggi, and Gangwon, which is close to North Korea. In Jeonnam, Gyeongnam, and Chungnam, the risk of scrub typhus is high. Figure 4 -a presents the top five districts in Seoul in July, 2017 in terms of risk for malaria infection. Figure 4 -b presents the top five districts in Gyeonggi in terms of risk for malaria infection. Figure 5 presents the top five districts nationwide in July, 2017 in terms of risk for malaria infection. The x-axis represents the district, and the y-axis represents the infected population. This chart shows the user the district where the outbreak of the infectious disease was the most severe when they select the year, month, district, and infectious disease. Additionally, users can infer risky districts by comparing the charts from each district utilizing the infectious disease criteria. Figure 4 shows users the districts that are at high risk of infection in Seoul and Gyeonggi and helps by comparing the two charts to identify sensitive districts in terms of malaria occurrence. Figure 4 -a presents the number of infections in each district with a high risk of infection representing three or fewer infections, whereas Figure 4 -b-reveals that there were more than 20 infected people in a single district. The user can compare these two charts and predict that malaria will occur much more frequently in Gyeonggi than in Seoul.",

Most existing infectious disease information systems display only text-centric information with regard to infectious disease outbreaks. Therefore, grasping infectious disease outbreak information at a glance is difficult for users. The infectious disease information system proposed in this paper provides infection outbreak information through various forms of charts. We described our system configuration and showcased various implementation results in this paper. Our system, DOVE visualizes statistical data by district, time, infectious disease, gender, and age through a web interface. Users can not only infer the characteristics of infectious diseases from various charts but also predict their occurrence based on district, time, gender, and age. We believe that DOVE can aid people in easily identifying and preventing infectious diseases. DOVE is currently live on the web at http://www.epidemic.co.kr /statistics.",
