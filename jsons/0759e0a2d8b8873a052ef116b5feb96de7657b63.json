A full list of CCS guidance documents is available in the editorial by Graham et al in this issue. 1 For its part, the CJC has developed a strategy to allow rapid review, dissemination and publication of manuscripts related to Covid-19. All relevant submissions are sent out for rapid review, aiming to provide an editorial decision within 7 days. Papers are then published rapidly in electronic form and designated for print publication in the next available issue. The first set of Covid-related papers appears in print form in this (June) issue of CJC, and is the focus of the issue.",

The Chinese used vigorous case identification, along with tracking of contacts and isolation of sources of infection, to limit spread and eventually allow cautious resumption of activities. While one can argue about the precise details of the Chinese approach and its effectiveness, one must not ignore it and the many lessons that can be learned. China and other countries like South Korea that effectively controlled Covid-19 relied heavily on extensive screening followed by careful isolation/tracking of cases and contacts. Since effective broadscale vaccination is likely 12-18 months away, the only way that the public can be protected, while avoiding economic ruin, is to enforce strict public health measures. Any society that attempts to reopen economic activity without careful public health controls risks seeing rapid reactivation of widespread infection and death. patients, 11 reminding us that Covid-19 can produce serious cardiac complications. 5 Finally, Babu et al provide discuss approaches to maintaining cardiac rehabilitation services despite social distancing and limited institutional access. 12 Their suggestions for more effective use of technologically-driven remote rehabilitation may prove valuable outside the pandemic in underserviced areas of challenging environments like rural Canada. 13 CJC and CJCO are continuing to receive many submissions related to Covid-19, and to prioritize rapid editorial consideration and dissemination. Covid began as a sprint, but unfortunately is likely to play out as a marathon (and will feel still longer); optimizing the information base will help to deal with the cardiovascular complications along the way.

Cardinal et al provide preliminary evidence that the use of fetal echocardiography to screen for congenital malformations can be reduced greatly for patients with a normal 2 nd trimester scan, without missing severe congenital heart disease. 7 Marenzi et al share their experience dealing with tertiary in-hospital management of acute coronary syndromes in the hard-hit Lombardy region of Italy, without units dedicated to isolation of Covid-19 patients. 8 While the optimum is clearly to have all Covid-positive patients hospitalized in individual negative-pressure rooms geographically distinct from Covid-free subjects, this is often not possible under real-world conditions. Thadathilankal et al provide a commentary 9 that takes issue with prior comments by Bombardini et al, 10 emphasizing the complexity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) system balance that governs the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the most common major complication of Covid-19. Peng et al report cardiac-rhythm complications in Covid-19",
