            "text": "The search for order and pattern in the immense complexity of tropical forests led early workers to hypothesize that tree species were associated with microhabitats defined by topography, drainage, soils or light at the local (<1 km2) scale (e.g., Richards 1952, Poore 1968). These ideas have borne out: virtually every study that has looked for evidence of species\u2010habitat associations in tropical forests has found it (the literature survey in Appendix S1 lists nearly 40 studies from the last two decades alone). Habitat associations are typically inferred from statistically significant differences in densities across discrete habitats or continuous environmental gradients as a first step. Processes underlying this differential success can then be inferred from studies of demography (survival, reproduction, dispersal and growth), traits, and phylogenies (Baraloto et al. 2007, Yamada et al. 2007, Russo et al. 2008, Comita and Engelbrecht 2009, Kraft and Ackerly 2010, Zuidema et al. 2010).",

            "text": "To what extent does niche specialization result from niche differentiation\u2014i.e., segregation of species along niche axes as predicted by niche theory (Hutchinson 1957)? The two phenomena are often implicitly conflated, but this is unjustified because niche specialization is neither necessary nor sufficient for niche differentiation. It is not necessary because niches could be partitioned amongst sub\u2010populations of species, and it is not sufficient because multiple species could be specialized to the same niche. Indeed, trees may specialize along niche axes independent of the existence of other tree species: intrinsic tradeoffs in fitness across environments, underlain by costs of adaptation to particular conditions, can force species to specialize (Futuyma and Moreno 1988, Kassen 2002). Species may specialize to different regions in niche space simply as a consequence of their differing evolutionary and biogeographic histories, which, in essence is an individualistic or autecological view of species in communities (Gleason 1926, Strong 1983). In neutrally assembled communities, therefore, species\u2010pairs can exhibit a gradient of niche overlaps even in the absence of interspecific interactions. Classical niche theory predicts that overlaps in equilibrium communities would be minimized because species occupying identical niches cannot coexist indefinitely (Hardin 1960)\u2014this is one extreme scenario, where every species ends up specialized to a niche distinct from that of all other species in the community. In the other extreme, neutral\u2010theoretic scenario (Hubbell 2001), species with identical niches and no fitness differences are able to coexist long enough for local and global extinctions to be offset by immigration and speciation, respectively. Testing for the presence of both habitat associations and niche differentiation tells us where a community lies in this spectrum of possibilities. This has rarely been done: the few studies from tropical forests that have tested if observed tree niches differ more than a null model that excludes niche differentiation (Potts et al. 2004, Noguchi et al. 2007, Inman\u2010Narahari et al. 2013) suggest that niche differentiation is less prevalent in these forests than is suggested by the presence of habitat associations.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the prevalence of habitat associations and niche differentiation appears to vary considerably across studies and forests (Appendix S1). This leads to the question of whether the importance of niche structuring relative to other processes varies across forests and whether this happens in any systematic manner. Comparing data from 14 forests, Brown et al. (2013) found that the variance in the spatial overlap of tree\u2010species pairs\u2014which they interpreted as importance of spatial niche differentiation\u2014tended to increase with increasing topographic heterogeneity. The idea here is that increasing topographic heterogeneity creates increased spatial niche opportunities. Similarly, it may be hypothesized that the importance of temporal niche differentiation increases with increasing temporal resource heterogeneity\u2014indeed, environmental fluctuations such as seasonality, interannual climatic variation, and disturbance can promote coexistence by creating temporal niche opportunities (Chesson and Huntly 1997, Chesson et al. 2004, Miller and Chesson 2009).",

However, studies from seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) are conspicuous by their near absence from the surveyed literature (Appendix S1). Available evidence suggests that tree species distributions are less strongly structured at the local scale by topography or soils, compared to forests in the wetter tropics (Bunyavejchewin et al. 2004, John and Sukumar 2004, Baldeck et al. 2012). SDTFs, which constitute 42% of tropical ecosystems globally, experience\u2014by definition\u2014several months of severe drought (Mooney et al. 1995) which influences the phenology of the forest as a whole (Dirzo et al. 2011). In addition, some SDTFs experience considerable interannual precipitation variability (Murphy and Lugo 1986) and are characterized by pulse disturbance agents such as fire (McShea and Davies 2011) and large herbivorous mammals (Sukumar et al. 2005). It is therefore possible that SDTF tree species stably coexist even if they do not appear to segregate along spatially varying, but temporally fixed, resource gradients, if indeed temporal segregation is more important in these ecosystems than in forests in the wetter, aseasonal tropics.",

            "text": "The justification for spatiotemporal analysis is as follows. The stand of a given species at a given point in time is a superimposition of individuals that had recruited at various previous points in time. However, recruitment can shift spatially depending on environmental conditions (e.g., Metz 2012). For instance, we observed that recruitment in most species in a permanent 50\u2010ha tropical dry forest plot at Mudumalai (Sukumar et al. 2004) during a drought in 2002\u20132004 was largely restricted to lower elevations, particularly close to stream channels. Conversely, during an above\u2010average precipitation period of 2006\u20132008, recruitment occurred more strongly at higher elevations. If niche differentiation is only important at the recruitment (sapling) stage, it is possible that recruits spatially niche\u2010segregate at every given point in time, but, because recruitment shifts in space over time, no signature of spatial niche segregation is detectable in any given stand, which is an integration of a large number of past recruitment events. On the other hand, niche differences amongst recruits in any given year may be difficult to detect due to small sample sizes, compared to the entire stand. The spatiotemporal analysis of recruits in the elevation\u2010precipitation niche space provides a means to detect this kind of niche differentiation.",

The plot lies in a transition zone between tropical dry\u2010deciduous and moist\u2010deciduous forest types (Champion and Seth 1968) to the east of a local peak (Bellur Betta, 1,083 m). The topography is undulating (elevation range 120 m, slope range 0\u201330\u00b0) and is dissected by a network of ephemeral, monsoonal streams that combine to drain the plot from the southern edge. Weathering\u2010resistant amphibolites dominate higher elevations while lower elevations are dominated by relatively weathering\u2010susceptible hornblende\u2010biotite gneisses; charnockites are distributed throughout in smaller numbers (Pulla et al. 2016). Soils are nutrient rich, nearly neutral, black to reddish\u2010brown sandy clay loams and sandy clays. Higher elevations in the plot have greater soil moisture, plant\u2010available Ca, Cu, Mn, Mg, Zn, B, clay and total carbon compared with lower elevations, a pattern that reflects the variation in lithology and topography (Pulla et al. 2016). Other soil properties\u2014Fe, Al, P and K\u2014are either weakly related or unrelated to variation in lithology and topography; a NE\u2013SW trending high\u2010P patch is notable. All soil properties except pH show spatial autocorrelation up to at least 100 m. Mean annual precipitation at Kargudi, located ~4 km from the plot, during 1988\u20132015 was 1,260 \u00b1 274 mm (range 763\u20131,840 mm). Mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures at Kargudi during 1990\u20132013 were 27.4\u00b0C and 16.4\u00b0C, respectively. Precipitation largely occurs during the southwest or summer (June\u2013September) and the northeast or winter (October\u2013November) monsoons; it is <100 mm per month during the 6\u2010month dry season (November\u2013April). At the landscape scale, dry\u2010season ground fires occur with an average fire\u2010return interval of 6 yr in the tropical dry deciduous forest region (Kodandapani et al. 2008) though there are differences in these intervals across a precipitation gradient (Mondal and Sukumar 2016). Logging of select species in the region in which the plot is located extended from at least the early part of the nineteenth century to prior to 1968 (Sukumar et al. 2005). The diameter distribution of the community is left\u2010skewed, but exhibits large inter\u2010census variation in the smaller (<20\u2010cm) size classes, owing mainly to large abundance fluctuations in the understory species; the larger (\u226520\u2010cm) size classes have remained relatively stable across censuses (Sukumar et al. 2005). Most species are spatially aggregated, regardless of abundance, with the intensity of aggregation tending to increase with decreasing spatial scale and with increasing tree diameter (Condit et al. 2000). The canopy cover is 50\u201375% and canopy height 15\u201320 m (Sukumar et al. 2004). Characteristic canopy species include Lagerstroemia microcarpa Wt., Terminalia crenulata Roth., Anogeissus latifolia (DC.) Bedd. and Tectona grandis L. f. The understory is characterized by Kydia calycina Roxb., Helicteres isora L., Cassia fistula L., Catunaregam spinosa (Thunb) Tirveng., Phyllanthus emblica L., and the alien invasive species Lantana camara L. and Chromolaena odorata (L.) King & Robinson. The forest floor is dominated by perennial tall grasses, mainly Themeda cymbaria Hac. and Cymbopogon flexuosus (Steudel) Watson.",

Subsequent annual censuses recorded recruitment and mortality in the entire plot for the first 20 yr, following which, owing to a spurt in total number of individuals, annual censuses were restricted to a subsample of 100 40 \u00d7 40\u2010m quadrats, representing roughly one\u2010third of the plot. Diameter at breast height was measured in the entire plot every fourth year starting 1988.

(2016). To reduce the number of variables being considered, we combined Ca, Mg and K into a single measure representing Total Exchangeable Bases (henceforth TEB). Plant\u2010available N (in nitrate\u2010 and ammonium\u2010 N forms) was not used as it appears that stocks were being rapidly modified while sampling progressed from one end of the plot to the other (Pulla et al. 2016). Soil point samples were used to generate nutrient maps using trans\u2010Gaussian kriging with external drift. Since the number of spatial variables was very large (14) and since several of them were correlated with each other, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to obtain a smaller set of uncorrelated variables. Topographic and soil variables, and their principal components, are hereafter collectively referred to as spatial environment variables. Each quadrat's spatial environment variable value was calculated as the average of the values of its four vertices. For each census, quadrat values were assigned to all individuals present within the quadrat during that census. Annual precipitation in the year preceding a census was used as the temporal environment variable and assigned to all individuals present in the census.",

In practice, we found using simulated data that the histogram was as accurate in measuring niche overlap as Gaussian kernel density estimators. In addition, current implementations of the latter were either restricted in dimensionality or were extremely slow to compute in higher dimensions; we therefore used histograms in our analyses. Since not all combinations of environment variable values occur with the same frequency in the plot, the occurrence density was divided by the density f\ne(z) of the environment variables themselves in order to obtain the \u201coccupancy\u201d density for a given entity (Broennimann et al. 2012; also referred to in the literature as \u201celectivity\u201d, see (Gotelli and Graves 1996); this is the \u201cadjusted\u201d density of Itoh et al. 2010): gs(zi)=fs(zi)/fe(zi)iffe(zi)\u226000otherwise,i=1,\u2026,k,where the density is evaluated at k points. g\ns(z\ni) was then rescaled to integrate to 1: gs\u2032(zi)=gs(zi)\u2211i=1kgs(zi).\n",

Thus, environmental maps were randomly translated and reflected along cardinal directions 2500 times following toroidal edge\u2010wrapping rules (Lotwick and Silverman 1982, Upton and Fingleton 1985) and the test statistic (i.e., generalized standard deviation) recalculated each time in order to generate its null distribution.

Homogeneous PCPs were used to simulate species under the null, while inhomogeneous PCPs were used to simulate them under the alternate hypothesis. In both cases, species exhibited spatiotemporal contagion in world space according to PCP parameters (namely, number of cluster centers, number of points per cluster, and the standard deviation of each cluster), regardless of their densities in niche space.

Variances of this multivariate distribution for each species were drawn randomly and independently from a log\u2010normal distribution while means were drawn randomly from a normal distribution with a covariance matrix that had negative off\u2010diagonal elements, which results in overdispersed means and, hence, reduced niche overlaps.

            "text": "While distilling general patterns from the literature survey in Appendix S1 is stymied by differences in sampling design, niche variables considered and statistical analyses performed, a few tentative insights are offered here. There is growing evidence, particularly from large, fully censused plots, which argues that species\u2010habitat associations at the local scale are the norm in tropical forests around the world. Habitats in these studies were typically defined by topography, soils and light availability. Although topographic variables, being readily available, were used in virtually all studies, inclusion of soil variables tended to further emphasize habitat structuring of communities (Hall et al. 2004, Baldeck et al. 2012). Studies using identical sampling design and statistical tests across multiple sites suggest that the sharper the environment gradient\u2014or the more abrupt a discontinuity\u2014at the local scale, the stronger, apparently, the restriction in species distributions with respect to that gradient or discontinuity (Potts et al. 2004, Davies et al. 2005, John et al. 2007, Brown et al. 2013). Indeed, some of the best examples of habitat\u2010niche specialization are from highly topographically heterogeneous sites (Gunatilleke et al. 2006, Zhang et al. 2011). Nevertheless, most studies find that species often appear to specialize to the same locations in niche space. Studies that show systematic niche differences across entire plant communities, such as those from lowland wet meadows in the UK or the South African fynbos (Silvertown et al. 1999, Araya et al. 2011), are yet to be replicated in tropical forests. While it is possible that important axes for niche differentiation may have been missed in tropical forest studies, axes relating to resources (water, nutrients, light), substrate and microhabitat conditions have all been considered. Low statistical power may play a part in the inability to detect statistically significant species\u2010habitat associations or niche differences, especially given the large numbers of rare species in most tropical forest communities, although it is difficult to be sure how prevalent an issue this is since power is rarely quantified. On the other hand, the false\u2010positive rate in some studies may be higher than the nominal 5%: awareness of violation of statistical test assumptions due to positive spatial autocorrelation was limited in studies prior to the work of Plotkin et al. (2000) and Harms et al. (2001), and P\u2010values have not always been adjusted for the large numbers of hypotheses tests conducted. An important caveat in our survey is possibility of the presence of both selection bias (e.g., selection of a few \u201cinteresting\u201d species from the community rather than on the basis of some objective criteria) and publication bias (under\u2010reporting of negative results).",

            "text": "Broadly overlapping niches of tree species reported in some studies (Appendix S1) need not automatically invoke undiscovered niches; indeed, they may represent convergent adaptation of several species to a frequently encountered environmental condition (Hubbell and Foster 1986). This is consistent with the idea that niche limits are also imposed by intrinsic tradeoffs (Kassen 2002). Consequently, a substantial amount of the observed niche convergence or divergence in any community may be attributable to chance variation in evolutionary histories of species, independently of the presence of other species in the community (Strong 1983). This autecological perspective is more parsimonious than one involving competitive interactions and is consistent with two recent, global tropical forest studies of large plots that included the Mudumalai 50\u2010ha plot. Brown et al. (2013) found that species have more restricted distributions with increasing topographic heterogeneity, thereby increasing both positive as well as negative spatial overlaps (Fig. S1 in Brown et al. 2013). If this pattern was caused only by niche differentiation, we would not expect positive spatial overlaps to increase with topographic heterogeneity. If, instead, species became restricted in geographical space primarily due to intrinsic tradeoffs in performance over ever sharper environmental gradients, both positive and negative spatial overlaps would be expected to increase. However, niche differentiation is a possible explanation for the left skew of these distributions, representing a slightly greater proportion of negative, compared to positive, spatial overlaps. Chisholm et al. (2014) reported large abundances fluctuations in tropical forests at the decadal timescale that were greater in magnitude than would be expected if either negative\u2010density dependence resulting from niche differentiation or species\u2010neutral demographic stochasticity were dominant. A parsimonious interpretation of this pattern is that species are responding to fluctuations in the environment in an individualistic manner. Thus, the order that many have sought in the complexity of tropical forest communities does exist to the extent that the distributions of several species are restricted to locations in space and time defined by environment gradients. This is not to deny that fine\u2010scale niche differentiation may exist, but current available evidence from tropical forests does not seem to support it.",
