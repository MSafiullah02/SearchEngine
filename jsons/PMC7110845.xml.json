The clinical features of PRRS are well known, a global picture of the epidemiology has been drawn, although some gaps remain to be filled, management and husbandry procedures have been devised for controlling the disease and vaccines are available. However, infection by PRRS virus (PRRSV) is still widespread and the virus is frequently reintroduced to farms after eradication. What are the reasons for such failures? The answer is not simple, but examination of the scientific literature and problems reported by pig veterinarians indicates that vaccines can be a useful tool, although their efficacy is far from being universal and complete. The approach of \u201clet\u2019s take a strain, let\u2019s attenuate or inactivate it and, voil\u00e0! the vaccine will generate sufficient immunity to protect against the disease\u201d is not valid for PRRSV.",

PRRSV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) reaches a peak at day 14 PI and then declines to undetectable levels by 42 days PI. Concentrations of IgG reach a maximum at 21\u201349 days PI (Vezina et al., 1996, Loemba et al., 1996). However, this rapid IgM and IgG response does not correspond to neutralising antibodies (NAs) (Yoon et al., 1994).",

Other studies showed that non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) contains a cluster of non-neutralising B-epitopes and probably is the immunodominant protein of PRRSV (Oleksiewicz et al., 2001, de Lima et al., 2006).

Other authors showed that complement may increase VNT titres by one dilution (Diaz et al., 2005, Diaz et al., 2006). Since the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol significantly reduced the sensitivity of the modified VNT, it is likely that low levels of neutralising IgM appear in the early phases of the infection (Takikawa et al., 1996). However, even with this modified VNT, NA titres were still relatively low (1/32\u20131/64) by day 42 PI.",

Targets for these antibodies are GP5 and N proteins (Yoon et al., 1996, Cancel-Tirado et al., 2004). The non-neutralising humoral response may act as a Trojan horse for PRRSV by coating the virus and enhancing the internalisation of viral particles into macrophages.

Following experimental infection, viraemia may be resolved without detectable levels of neutralising antibodies (Diaz et al., 2006). Similar to the related virus lactate dehydrogenase virus (LDV), the dynamics of PRRSV-susceptible macrophages may govern the levels of viraemia (Diaz et al., 2006). If cytolysis or apoptosis exhaust most susceptible macrophages, infection will be confined to macrophage-rich organs, such as lymph nodes.

GP5, the main target for NAs, contains up to four glycosylation sites, located in or close to the neutralising epitope. American field strains of PRRSV lacking glycosylation sites in the upstream hypervariable region induced NAs more rapidly and more strongly in infected pigs than strains lacking the downstream glycosylation site at position 44 (N-44), even though all strains were equally susceptible to NAs (Faaberg et al., 2006). As Spanish PRRSV strains have evolved from 1991\u20132005, there has been a trend to lose the glycosylation site at N-46 (equivalent to N-44 of American strains) and to maintain or gain glycosylations in the flanking regions (N-37 and N-53), consistent with selection of strains inducing weaker NA responses (Mateu et al., 2006).",

NAs may protect against disease if present in sufficient quantities before infection, but they do not seem to be essential for clearing virus in blood during the course of the infection. PRRSV is able to modulate innate responses, probably through the regulation of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-10 responses. Two different PRRSV genotypes exist that have evolved in parallel. Cross protection afforded by each genotype is only partial and genetic diversity within each genotype can be high enough to allow a vaccinated animal to be re-infected by a different strain of the same genotype.
