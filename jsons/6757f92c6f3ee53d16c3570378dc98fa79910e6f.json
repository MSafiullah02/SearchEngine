Procedure Normal Harderian glands were evaluated ultrasonographically in 20 rabbits, 10 guinea pigs, and eight chinchillas. The Harderian gland was measured ultrasonographically in horizontal and vertical planes. Normal Harderian gland sizes were then compared with sizes in 27 rabbits, 13 guinea pigs, and three chinchillas that had exophthalmos. Results Harderian glands in normal rabbits were 0.69 AE 0.07 cm (mean value AE SD) horizontally and 1.33 AE 0.14 cm vertically. Harderian glands in normal guinea pigs were 0.58 AE 0.05 cm horizontally and 0.61 AE 0.10 vertically. In normal chinchillas, the Harderian glands were 0.53 AE 0.04 cm horizontally and 0.53 AE 0.03 cm vertically. Harderian glands were significantly larger in the vertical plane in rabbits with exophthalmos (P = 0.001) and in the horizontal plane in guinea pigs with exophthalmos (P = 0.018). Harderian glands of rabbits with exophthalmos were significantly larger in both diseased and healthy glands in both planes compared with those of normal rabbits. Guinea pigs and chinchillas with exophthalmos had larger Harderian glands bilaterally in only the vertical plane. Conclusions Ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic imaging technique to evaluate the Harderian gland in the rabbit, guinea pig, and chinchilla. Retrobulbar pathologic processes cause enlargement of the Harderian gland, which may be attributable to inflammation or possible obstruction of the excretory ducts.",

            "text": "The Harderian gland is an orbital gland found in some vertebrates and was first described in 1694 by Johann Jacob Harder in deer, giving the gland its name. 1, 2 The gland is also called the Glandula palpebrae tertiae profunda, associating it with the third eyelid in mammals. 3 The gland is a tubuloalveolar gland with its secretory duct opening at the nictitating membrane in the posterior canthus. The main secretory substance of the mammalian Harderian gland is lipid. 4, 5 The Harderian gland has various functions including lubrication of the ocular surface and third eyelid, a site of immune response, a photoreceptive organ, a source of pheromones, thermoregulation, and a source of growth factors. 4, 5 The Harderian gland of the rabbit is located infraorbitally between the eyeball and medial or ventral part of the orbit and is in contact with the nictitating membrane. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] It is divided into a white lobe, which is smaller and located more rostral, and a larger pink lobe in the ventral part of the orbit. Both lobes are divided by a thin band of connective tissue and converge into a single excretory duct which opens into the lower posterior part of the third eyelid near the conjunctival sac. 5, 11, 12 The pink lobe consists of cuboidal cells and contains large lipid vacuoles, producing more lipids than the white lobe. The white lobe cells are columnar with smaller vacuoles. [12] [13] [14] [15] The guinea pig's Harderian gland is large and occupies a considerable part of the retrobulbar space, resting against the posterior part of the globe. [6] [7] [8] 13, 16, 17 The gland is round, smoothly margined, and whitish to slightly pink in color. The optic nerve and extraocular muscles are embedded in the lobulated gland. The Harderian gland has both a dorsolateral and medial attachment to the periorbita. 17 The single excretory duct opens into the posterior 16 or anterior 5 surface of the rudimentary third eyelid. The alveoli of the Harderian gland have wide lumina and produce lipids. 5, 13, 17 Myoepithelial cells are attached to the glandular endpieces, maintaining their contour, and serving as their exoskeleton. 18 The Harderian gland of the chinchilla is oval, 0.9 cm in length, whitish in color, and nonlobulated. It is firmly attached to the posterior part of the globe and extends medially. 19 The tubuli and alveoli are lined with cuboidal to columnar cells. The gland produces lipid and has small intra-and interglandular ducts. Clinical visualization of the excretory duct has not been possible. 19 The third eyelid is rudimentary. 19, 20 The purpose of this study was to determine, whether the Harderian gland is visible ultrasonographically and to establish normal size reference values for rabbits, guinea pigs, and chinchillas. These values were compared with those measured for the Harderian gland in animals with exophthalmos, to establish whether the Harderian gland becomes enlarged with orbital disease.",

An HDI 5000 ultrasound unit (Philips, Bothell, WA, USA) with a 5-8 MHz small parts transducer or 15-7 MHz linear transducer was used for the examination of all animals, except for the normal rabbits, where a Logiqbook ultrasound unit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) with a 5-8 MHz small parts ultrasound transducer was used.

The others are the lacrimal, intraorbital, and superficial gland of the third eyelid. 22 The exact proportion of tear production by each gland has not been reported. The Harderian gland in the rabbit produces lipids, especially in the pink lobe. 4, 5, 11, 14 Due to this lipid production, the Harderian gland is difficult to visualize ultrasonographically and to differentiate it from retrobulbar fat. Knowledge of its special anatomy and size allows ultrasonographic imaging of the Harderian gland. The gland appears hypoechoic in the rabbit with the pink lobe slightly more hypoechoic than the white lobe. The echogenicity of fat depends on the number of fat-filled vacuoles in an area as well as their size. This phenomenon has been described with hypoechoic foci in hepatic lipidosis. 23 The larger the fat vacuoles, the more hypoechoic the area appears due to fewer tissue interfaces. This would also explain, why the pink lobe with larger vacuoles is more hypoechoic than the white lobe. [12] [13] [14] The white lobe has a higher content of lipid droplets which gives it its white color. 24 Measurements of the normal rabbit Harderian gland in anatomic sections have been reported to be approximately 19 mm long and 4-6 mm thick. 24 In our study, the mean length of the gland was 13 mm, the mean thickness was 6.9 mm. Differences in measurement values may be attributed in part to variation in age among rabbits of the study reported here. Additionally, morphological and biochemical property variations of Harderian glands exist and are influenced by endogenous factors (e.g., hormones) and exogenous factors (e.g., temperature, photoreception, and thermoregulation). 5, 13 The discrepancy in length may also be due to the fact that the gland has rounded margins and wraps around the medial and ventral portion of the eyeball.",

Other pathologic processes included steatitis and purulent necrosis of the retrobulbar fatty tissue. In rats, inflammation of the lacrimal and salivary glands (sialodacryoadenitis) is associated with hypertrophy of the Harderian gland and is caused by a rat coronavirus. 25 In the rabbit, primary inflammatory disease of the Harderian gland is not reported, but it appears to undergo a similar pathogenesis secondary to retrobulbar inflammation. One rabbit had lymphoma of the Harderian gland previously described. 21 Tumors of the Harderian gland have been described in mice, with cystadenomas and adenocarcinomas occurring most frequently. 26 Exophthalmos associated with a cranial mediastinal mass or thymoma is commonly bilateral. This is believed to be a paraneoplastic syndrome and occurs when venous drainage by the jugular veins is obstructed. 22, 27, 28 In this study, two rabbits with thymoma and bilateral exophthalmos were found. There was retrobulbar edema, and all four Harderian glands were enlarged and appeared more hyperechoic.",
