            "text": "In May 2015, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) caused 185 cases and 36 deaths in the Republic of Korea (Lee and Wong, 2015) when the virus is circulating mainly in Saudi Arabia since September in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012). One decade ago, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2010CoV caused total 8096 cases worldwide and 346 cases with 37 deaths in Taiwan (Ksiazek et al., 2003). Phylogenetic analysis showed that MERS\u2010CoV clustered in the same subgroup with Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Lau et al., 2013). Later, bat CoV HKU4 was found capable of using the same cell receptor of MERS CoV (Yang et al., 2014b). MERS\u2010related CoV was also detected in Nycteris bats of Ghana and Pipistrellus bats of Europe, Neoromicia zuluensis bats of South Africa, and Vespertilio superans bats of China (Annan et al., 2013; Ithete et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014a). Rhinolophus bats have been suggested as natural reservoirs of SARS\u2010CoV because the SARS related (SARSr) CoV found in Rhinolophus sinicus of Yunnan in China had 99.9% of sequence identity with human SARS\u2010CoV and were able to use the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of humans, civets and bats as receptors to infect cells from human, civets and bats (Ge et al., 2013). The outbreaks of MERS CoV re\u2010emphasized the importance of bat\u2010surveillance programs on CoV since the emergence of SARS CoV.",

            "text": "The organization of CoV genome is in the order of 5\u2010polymerase\u2010spike (S)\u2010envelope (E)\u2010membrane (M)\u2010nucleocapsid (N)\u2010polyA\u20103. The polymerase gene encodes 15 to 16 non\u2010structural proteins including RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, used commonly for phylogenetic analysis (Woo et al., 2012). As the largest enveloped RNA viruses with single plus\u2010stranded RNA genomes of 26 to 32 kb, CoV are classified into four genera from Alpha\u2010 to Deltacoronavirus. The genus Betacoronavirus had four subgroups from 2a to 2d, including SARSr CoV from human, civet cats, raccoon dogs and bats belonging to subgroup 2b and MERS CoV belonging to subgroup 2c (Agnihothram et al., 2014). Both Alpha\u2010 and Betacoronavirus have been found in the countries around Taiwan, including China, Philippines, Thailand and Japan. The most common bat species carrying bat CoV are Rhinolophus, Pipistrellus and Miniopterus bats (Tang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2010; Gouilh et al., 2011; Shirato et al., 2012), which distribute widely in Asia, including Taiwan. They could carry and transmit bat CoV into local bat population of Taiwan via migration even though little is known about the migratory patterns of bats. Closely related CoV can be detected in the same bat species living at locations separated by thousands of miles (Drexler et al., 2010) and different CoV species or genera can be found in different bat species living at the same roosting sites (Chu et al., 2006; Gloza\u2010Rausch et al., 2008; Tong et al., 2009; Drexler et al., 2010). From a host switch, certain CoV species can be detected in totally different hosts (Gloza\u2010Rausch et al., 2008). In addition, one bat species can harbour more than one CoV species (Chu et al., 2006; Tong et al., 2009). There are 11 endemic species and six endemic subspecies in 36 bat species in Taiwan (Wu et al., 2012; Csorba et al., 2014; Ruedi et al., 2015). Between two biodiversity hotspots, Southeastern China and Philippines, Taiwan has an impressive biodiversity on unit area, 4.6 and 9 times higher than Thailand and Japan, respectively (Csorba et al., 2014). It is critical for public health to understand the correlation between the prevalence of CoV and the dynamics of endemic and non\u2010endemic bat species in Taiwan.",

Because of the ability of fly and migrate and the tendency to live in the large sizes of social groups, bats are predisposed to maintain and transport viruses to other mammals for the possible outbreaks of epidemics (Bennett, 2006). Habitat types of bats include caves, trees and human\u2010made constructions. The accumulation of bat faeces in schools or houses posts a potential risk for public health (Dobson, 2005). As a potential zoonotic pathogen, CoV is regarded as particularly significant because its high mutation rate, high frequency of recombination, faecal\u2010oral transmission, and environment resistance of faeces\u2010immersed virus particles (Casanova et al., 2010; Graham and Baric, 2010; Geller et al., 2012). The investigation of RNA or infectious particles of CoV in the faeces accumulated on the ground under the roosting locations near or within human community, like Scotophilus bats in schools and houses, can be used to evaluate the exposure risk of CoV to human. Previous studies have shown that young and lactating female bats in maternity roosting sites had significant higher detection rate for bat CoV RNA (Gloza\u2010Rausch et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2010; Osborne et al., 2011). It is important to analyse the effects of bat physical properties on CoV infection for the risk assessment.",

A harp trap, butterfly net or mist net was used to catch bats. Species, body weight, gender, reproductive status and maturation status of bats were determined by experienced bat biologists at the Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute. According to the swelling of nipples, female bats can be classified into lactating, weaning and non\u2010lactating females. The mating status of male bats include mating, prepared to mate and non\u2010mating based on the production of semen by the descent testicles into scrotum. The bats with insufficient ephiphyseal\u2013diaphyseal closure in the metacarpal\u2013phalangeal joints were considered younger than 1 year old and others were considered adults. The captured bats were individually placed into cotton bags and allowed to produce faecal pellets. To clarify whether CoV RNA can be maintained in the surrounding environment, the accumulated faeces on clean plastic sheets overnight from Myotis formosus flavus at location 8 and those from Scotophilus kuhlii at location 6 and 9 were collected as ground faecal samples. Faecal samples were collected by 70% ethanol rinsed tweezers into tubes containing RNAlater\u00ae RNA stabilization solution (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for sample storage and transportation.",

Compared to the detection range of 5\u201373% for CoV RNA in bats worldwide, the CoV prevalence of 23% in Taiwan confirmed the widely distribution of CoV (Tang et al., 2006; Tong et al., 2009; Rihtaric et al., 2010; Balboni et al., 2011; Shirato et al., 2012; Woo et al., 2012; G\u00f3es et al., 2013; Su et al., 2016). Female bats had significantly higher detection rate for bat CoV in this study, especially Rhinolophus monoceros (38% in females and 8% in males). In breeding season, female bats and their offspring tend to roost together as maternity colony and viruses are easier to circulate in large number (Gloza\u2010Rausch et al., 2008). However, male and female Scotophilus bats roost together so no significance was found in the detection rate of CoV RNA for different genders, reproductive and maturation status of Scotophilus bats in this study. The presence of bat CoV RNA in 17% of ground faecal samples could post a risk for potential interspecies transmission through gene recombination, such as the emergence of human CoV (HCoV) NL63, HCoV HKU1, SARS CoV and MERS CoV (Bolles et al., 2011), if the faeces containing bat CoV are ingested by animals or humans. Further investigation on the survival of infectious bat CoV in the environment is needed.",

Similar observation was noted in the Rhinolophus pearsoni carrying SARSr CoV Rp3 in Guangxi of China, which caused acute and self\u2010limiting infection with viral clearance occurring between 2 weeks and 4 month (Lau et al., 2010). Recombination between SARSr CoV Rp3 from Guangxi and Rf1 from Hubei may generate SARSr CoV SZ3 isolated from civets. A 4\u2010year investigation on the migration pattern and genome epidemiology showed that Rhinolophus bats can migrate from 1.86 to 17 km and carry bat CoV HKU2 or SARSr CoV Rp3 for further co\u2010infection and frequent recombination (Lau et al., 2010). Scotophilus bat CoV 512 was only detected in one bat species, Scotophilus kuhlii, in Hainan Island of China and the Philippines previously (Tang et al., 2006; Watanabe et al., 2010). In this study, endemic Rhinolophus monoceros, endemic Kerivoula titania and migratory Miniopterus fuliginosus were detected positive for bat CoV RNA belonging to Scotophilus bat CoV 512 related lineage beside Scotophilus kuhlii.

            "text": "Bat CoVs sharing 96% of nucleotide identity to those of Miniopterus bat CoV 1A were not only detected in migratory Miniopterus fuliginosus but also endemic Submyotodon latirostris. It is also the first report that Miniopterus bat CoV 1 A can be detected in a non\u2010Miniopterus bat species. These two bat species did not share roosting location although all bats tested positive came from northern Taiwan. Another unique finding is that two different bat CoV lineages were detected in two different populations of Miniopterus fuliginosus whose living areas did not overlap. The distribution patterns of bat CoV in Miniopterus bats are very complicated. In Hong Kong, phylogenetically related Miniopterus bat CoV 1A and 1B have distinct host specificities to Miniopterus magnate and Miniopterus pusillus, respectively, even though these two bat species co\u2010inhabit the same cave. On the other hand, co\u2010infection of bat CoV 1B and HKU8 was detected in Miniopterus pusillus. No evidence of recombination was detected between bat CoV 1A, 1B, HKU8, 512, HKU2 and SARSr CoV isolated from Miniopterus bats (Chu et al., 2006). In Kenya, bat CoV 1A was isolated in Miniopterus africanus, Miniopterus minor and Miniopterus natalensis, and both bat CoV 1A and HKU8 can be isolated in Miniopterus inflatus (Tong et al., 2009). In Bulgaria, bat CoV 1A, HKU\u20107, and HKU\u20108 were detected in Miniopterus schreibersii but not Rhinolophus and Hipposideros bats although all three bat species shared the same cave (Woo et al., 2012). Since Miniopterus bats are migratory and the distance of migration is reported to be several hundreds of kilometers (Ramos Pareira et al., 2009), it is implied that Miniopterus bat CoV might be transmitted between Hong Kong, Japan, even Europe as a result of bat migration. Further investigations on the distribution of bat CoV and interactions between migratory and endemic bat species are required for the close monitoring on SARSr\u2010CoV and other bat CoV in Taiwan.",

Three bat CoV lineages identified as SARSr CoV, Scotophilus bat CoV 512 and Miniopterus bat CoV 1A, are very common in countries around Taiwan. Host switch may play a very important role in the distribution of different bat CoV from migratory bat species to Taiwan endemic bat species. Ongoing surveillance on bat CoV in different bat populations is necessary to understand the zoonotic potential of bat CoV.",
