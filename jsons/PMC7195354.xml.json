The novel coronavirus was officially named \u2018SARS-CoV-2\u2032 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and disease infected by this virus was termed \u2018COVID-19\u2032(Zu et al., 2020). Since the rapid spread of this epidemic disease, the government of China has quickly issued a public announcement on the prevention and treatment of the most serious infectious disease, which required that determine efficacious and straightforward measures to prevent disease transmission. However, coronavirus pneumonia patients were found in almost all provinces across our country in the short term. There was no doubt that medical workforce played an indispensable role in this major public health emergency.",

As a general provincial hospital in South China, our institution undertook a considerable number of investigations and diagnosis of suspected patients. Hospital staff were exposed to stress both physical and psychological in response to this serious infectious public health event (Chen et al., 2020a; Phelan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020b). Initially a comparison was conducted across hospital staff in due to the fact that the potential for work-related accumulated in declining mental health of them (Mulfinger et al., 2019), yet had not been examined during the epidemic of major infectious diseases. Besides, a study demonstrated that 42.0% of doctors working in Tertiary Hospitals in mainland China experienced very high levels of accumulated fatigue (Tang and Liu, 2019). Especially during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the heavier workload and life-threatening medical workers were facing aggravated the psychological pressure, even mental illness. Follow-up data suggested that hospital workers particularly doctor and nurse were more susceptible to psychological disorders after participating in the treatment of SARS patients over a decade ago (Verma et al., 2004). In particular, increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases were verified in many countries outside China. Therefore, it is extremely important to realize the psychological status of the medical workforce.",

We further divided all the participants into three subgroups according to the possibility to contact with coronavirus pneumonia patients of their departments: high-risk contact (working in department of respiratory, emergency, ICU and infectious disease), low-risk contact (working in the other clinical departments), and non-clinical (working in administrative, technical operation). As shown in Table 4\n, there were significant differences in fear (p = 0.027), anxiety (p = 0.003) and depression (p = 0.007) levels among three subgroups. Additionally, comparisons of three subgroups with each other, the staff working in the departments with high-risk contact with patients exhibited significantly greater fear (p = 0.024), anxiety (p = 0.005) and depression (p = 0.007) than those non-clinical staff, and obviously greater anxiety (p = 0.026) than the low-risk contact staff. In final multivariate analysis (Table 5\n), high-risk contact subgroup staff were 1.4 times as likely to feel fear (OR, 1.408; 95% CI, 1.025 - 1.933), twice as likely to suffer anxiety (OR, 2.062; 95% CI, 1.349 - 3.153) and depression (OR, 2.016; 95% CI, 1.102 - 3.685) than non-clinical subgroup staff.",

From a data analysis perspective, comparing the average values of fear, anxiety and depression between two groups, medical staff unfolded greater fear, anxiety and depression than administrative staff. The further analysis presented that the medical staff working in those departments close contacted with coronavirus pneumonia patients, such as respiratory department, emergency department, intensive care unit, and infectious diseases department, revealed more psychological disorders, and had almost twice risk for suffering anxiety and depression, compared to the non-clinical staff with hardly possibility to contact with coronavirus pneumonia patients.",

            "text": "What made them uneasy? Be universally known, SARS-CoV-2 highly infectious and spreads rapidly, front line health workers were bearing significantly increased workload. Directly contacting with confirmed patients, the shortage of protective equipment, suspected patients concealing medical history, all of these could increase the risk of being infected for them. Besides, they were afraid of bringing the virus to families and incapability when facing with critical patients. The greater number of these hurdles that they experienced, the greater likelihood that they felt incapable of reaching their aspirations. The resulting strain may then, in turn, be internalized and create anxiety and depression (Liu et al., 2019; Tempest et al., 2017). As we know, after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, medical workforce took pains to struggle with disease in the front line and protected health of the public (Wang et al., 2020; Xiao, 2020). These specific situations posed considerable stress on them, which might lead to high levels of psychological distress. Our discussion was consistent with studies regarding epidemic of SARS and MERS (Lee et al., 2018; Verma et al., 2004). The Chinese government has initiated strategies to emphasis the control of transmission (Kickbusch and Leung, 2020; Lee et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2020), and issued numbers of documents calling for attention to the mental and physical health of medical staff, even offered a series of supports and encouragements, such as provided a place for rest with food and supplies, replenished the protective equipment, medical team reinforcements, and strengthened security forces to maintain the order of medical treatment (Chen et al., 2020a; Qing et al., 2020; Zeng and Zhen, 2020). Then, for every hospital, it was important to help deal with coping strain and reduce the risk of suffering anxiety and depression of medical staff. Therefore, a human-oriented culture and paying more attention to the mental health of medical staff should be promoted for the future advancement of a hospital in China. In regard to the psychological problems of them, the comprehensive psychological consultation organization had established, even regularly do well on mental health management for medical staff for a long time (Friedman et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020b; Swerdlow and Finelli, 2020). For those who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Mak et al., 2010), we could track the follow-up conditions and order proper treatment.",
