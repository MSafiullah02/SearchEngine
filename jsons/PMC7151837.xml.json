This chapter begins with a brief overview of infection and autoimmunity in the eye, focusing on some of the unique features of the ocular microenvironment. This is followed by specific examples of infections and autoimmunity in the retina. We highlight two human diseases triggered by Onchocerca volvulus or Toxoplasma gondii and discuss an experimental model of retinal degenerative disease, referred to as experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR). This degeneration is triggered by the murine coronavirus, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and is characterized by genetic predisposition and autoimmune reactivity. Finally, we explore mechanisms by which different infectious agents trigger autoimmune reactivity.",

The eye is unique in that it lacks lymphatics and still enjoys an intimate relationship with the immune system. An inflammatory process nor where in the eye is called uveitis, but this term does not reflect the origin of the inflammatory process nor where in the eye it is located. While there are many descriptions of inflammatory processes in the eye, there are three major presentations of these conditions. If the inflammatory condition is centered in the front of the eye, the process is termed an anterior uveitis. If upon examination the dominant part of the inflammation is centered in the vitreous of the eye, it is termed an intermediate uveitis. Finally, if inflammation occurs in the back of the eye and is centered in the retina or the choroid, it is termed a posterior uveitis. Clearly, inflammatory conditions may involve several parts of the eye, and if all anatomic components of the eye are involved, it is termed a panuveitis.",

This is an excellent way to evaluate the retina\u2019s ability to react to a light stimulus. Fluorescein angiography, which uses a dye injected into a vein in the arm, allows photographs of the retina to be printed. This approach helps to visualize the vascular system and the integrity of the retina. The severity of the inflammatory response can be graded by direct visualization of the ocular inflammatory response. Most inflammatory processes that we recognize have associated cellular responses. We also know that antibody-mediated pathology, as seen in such entities as cancer-associated retinopathy, can occur but seem to do so in the distinct minority of cases.",

It is known that an antigen placed into the anterior chamber of the eye induces a deviated immune response, with a marked decrease in cell-mediated responses, but intact cytotoxic and B-cell responses are maintained (1). In addition, the retina is a complicated structure; several layers are needed to turn a light stimulus into a chemical signal that is ultimately sent to the brain. A number of uveitogenic antigens have been identified and characterized at the photoreceptor level and the single layer just below it, that is, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (2). Two antigens in particular, the retinal S-antigen and the inter-photoreceptor binding protein (IRBP), have been used to develop a model of autoimmune ocular disease, called experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (3). This model has many qualities of the disease observed in humans, and it has enhanced our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to disease. One major difference between this model and human disease is, of course, that it is not spontaneous. It is not clear what triggers the human disease. This chapter explores one such trigger\u2013ocular infection. Several entities, some based on animal models, others seen in the clinic, are discussed to elucidate the possible role between infection and autoimmunity.",

Either of these strains is responsible for approximately 50% of the incidence of the common cold. A new human coronavirus was discovered as the causative agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).12 One of the closest relatives to the human SARS-coronavirus is the murine coronavirus MHV. The JHM strain of MHV is the most thoroughly studied neurotrophic coronavirus. It causes both acute and chronic central nervous system (CNS) effects in mice and rats. Acute encephalomyelitis and chronic CNS disease have been observed in mice, whereas an autoimmune disease known as subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis has been described in rats.",

The presence of IFN-\u03b3 also was associated with an up-regulation of MHC class I and II molecules on a variety of retinal cells. In contrast, MHC class I and II molecules were not identified within the normal or mock-injected retinas. It was noted that the first cell to express these MHC molecules was the RPE cell. This cell is also the first cell to express new viral antigens during infection in vivo and is persistently infected in vitro.18 It is critically important to point out that this RPE cell has been shown to process and present retinal and non-retinal antigens to sensitized T cells, and it is up-regulated to express MHC class II molecules during retinal autoimmune and degenerative processes.19,\n20\n",

These studies identified a distinct difference in the early innate immune response between the susceptible and resistant mouse strains.21 These differences are noted in the production of IFN-\u03b3 and the two chemokines triggered by IFN-\u03b3: CXCL9 and CXCL10. For example, on day 2 and 3 PI, the BALB/c mice have high levels of IFN-\u03b3, CXCL9 and CXCL10 in their sera. At the same time, significantly lower levels of these molecules are detected in the sera from CD-1 mice. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis of retinas confirmed that CXCL9 and CXCL10 gene expression is significantly greater in the BALB/c mice retinas compared with CD-1 mice retinas. CXCL9 and CXCL10 interact with CXCR3, which is present on activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and they direct the migration of these cells to specific targets, such as the retina.22 These studies underscore an important concept: that innate immunity directs and sets the stage for adaptive immunity. In this model system, we describe how the robust immune response in the BALB/c mouse could trigger an autoimmune component.",

We inoculated selected strains of mice (BABL/c, C57B1, A/J, and CD-1) and examined the retinal disease. When C57B1 and A/J mice were evaluated, we observed a disease pattern similar to that observed in the BALB/c mice. However, retinal tissue damage induced by the JHM virus in the CD-1 mice was very different (Table 1\n). Only the early phase of the disease, consisting of retinal vasculitis, was observed. These CD-1 mice did not develop retinal degenerative disease. In fact, by day 20 PI, the retina had a normal appearance. These studies underscore the role of genetics in ECOR and showed that the genetics of the host profoundly affects the nature of retinal tissue damage.",

Inasmuch as viruses are known to trigger autoimmune phenomena and some human retinopathies may be associated with autoantibody formation, we studied the possible production of anti-retinal autoantibodies.23 We found that the degenerative process in the BALB/c mice was associated with the presence of anti-retinal autoantibodies (Table 2\n).

Villin-2 is found in both RPE cells and M\u00fcller cells. A truncated form of \u03b1-fodrin was expressed and purified. This purified \u03b1-fodrin reacted only with sera from virus-infected BALB/c mice. Moreover, CD4 T cells from virus-infected BALB/c mice specifically responded to \u03b1-fodrin peptide. These data suggest that both antibodies to \u03b1-fodrin and CD4 T cells specifically sensitized to \u03b1-fodrin may contribute to the retinal degeneration seen in the ECOR susceptible mice. It is of interest to note that autoantibodies to \u03b1-fodrin have been observed in three human diseases: glaucoma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.",

They reported that all the patients initially tested showed antibody responses to all three antigens.

However, 6 of 16 controls showed a similar staining pattern (p\n < 0.001). Interestingly, using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to measure the presence of anti-S-antigen antibodies, the researchers observed that 27 of 36 sera samples from patients with toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis were positive, but so were those from 10 of 16 normal individuals (p\n > 0.05).

In addition to the retinal S-antigen, we also evaluated the response to crude Toxoplasma antigen and to purified antigens from the parasite.31 We also used EIA to look for anti-S-antigen antibodies and investigated HLA phenotyping to determine whether a specific HLA type was associated with S-antigen responsiveness.

They found that patients with mild disease responded to one or more retinal antigens with a significantly higher frequency than patients without disease or with severe disease. Based on these findings, they suggested that the presence of cellular immune response towards retinal autoantigens is not protective against the development of ocular lesions induced by T. gondii, but it may protect against the development of severe disease. Autoimmune responses may protect the neural retina against the damage caused by infection with T. gondii. This protective effect may occur by providing the local cells with cytokines and growth factors that protect retinal cells and limit T. gondii replication.",

Using an immunofluorescent assay of human retina tissue, they observed reactivity in the inner retina and photoreceptor layers. During the 1990s, researchers performed a number of studies to elucidate the nature of autoimmune reactivity.36, 37, 38, 39 They identified a recombinant antigen in O. volvulus that showed immunologic cross-reactivity with a component of the RPE.36,\n37 Using Western blot analysis, an antibody to a 22,000-molecular weight antigen (OV39) of O. volvulus recognized a 44,000-molecular weight component of the RPE cell. Subsequent studies showed that hr44 antigen is present in the optic nerve, epithelial layers of iris, ciliary body, and RPE. Although OV39 and the hr44 proteins are not homologous, they did show limited amino acid sequence identity.40 Immunization of Lewis rats with either OV39 from O. volvulus of hr44 from human retinal tissue induced ocular pathology.39 Retinal disease in the rat was characterized by extensive breakdown of the posterior blood\u2013ocular barrier, iridocyclitis and retinitis and the activation of retinal microglia.

As the name infers, they are all characterized by whitish lesions of varying sizes that are found scattered throughout the fundus. Some patients have a significant associated inflammatory reaction, whereas others do not. The natural history of some may lead to significant visual handicap, whereas others may not. Some of these disorders seem to progress, yet others fade away. These disorders include such entities as acute multifocal placoid posterior pigment epitheliopathy (AMPPE), serpiginous choroiditis, the multifocal evanescent white dot syndrome, and multifocal choroiditis. The underlying cause of these diseases is unknown. Many of these disorders seem to be preceded by a viral illness, and AMPPE, was hypothesized to be due to Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection;43 however, this concept is no longer thought to be the case.44 A few patients have been treated with anti-viral medications, with unclear responses. The most common therapy for all of these conditions is immunosuppression, and therapy is directed against what is believed to be an autoimmune, or least non-infectious, process in the back of the eye.",

These data also indicate that distinct pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the induction of autoimmunity triggered by these three organisms. In T. gondii infections, the persistence and chronic reactivation of the organism is probably responsible for the introduction and presentation of sequestered retinal epitopes to the immune system. In O. volvulus infections, molecular mimicry between the organism and human RPE protein may contribute to the retinal pathology. In ECOR, similar processes are induced in coronavirus-infected mice displaying either susceptibility or resistance to retinal degeneration. However, recent evidence indicates that differences in time of induction, duration, and intensity of innate immune reactivity may contribute to autoimmune reactivity in BALB/c mice.",
