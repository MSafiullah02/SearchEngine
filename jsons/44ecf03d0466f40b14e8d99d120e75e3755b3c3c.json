For method 1, estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPe) was calculated as: CPPe = MAP \u00d7 (diastolic flow (Vd)/ mean flow (Vm)) + 14. For method 2, critical closing pressure (CrCP) was identified as the intercept point on the x-axis of the linear regression line of blood pressure and flow velocity parameters. CrCP/CPPe was then calculated as MAP-CrCP. Measurements and main results One hundred eight paired measurements were available. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CPPe was significant (r = 0.78, p = < 0.001). However, on Bland-Altman plots, bias was 3.7 mmHg with 95% limits of agreement of \u2212 17 to + 25 for CPPe. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CrCP/CPPe was significant (r = 0.59, p = < 0.001), but again bias was high at 11 mmHg with wide 95% limits of agreement of \u2212 15 to + 38 mmHg. Conclusions CPPe and CrCP/CPPe do not have clinical value to estimate the absolute CPP in pediatric patients with TBI.",

Neurosurgical expertise necessary to place invasive monitors is often not available in rural or in resourcelimited settings. Additionally, in some centers, there remains a lack of confidence that ICP/CPP-directed therapy benefits patients and children are managed with alternative therapeutic approaches [14] [15] [16] . Furthermore, while the risk is minimal, it is an invasive surgical technique occasionally associated with complications including infection and hemorrhage [17] . In a cohort of 4667 children with severe TBI, only 55% of patients had an ICP monitor placed [18] . Younger children may be even less likely to receive invasive ICP monitors. In another study of 238 children under age 24 months with severe TBI, only 17% had a monitor placed [19] . Outside the management of TBI, use of an ICP monitor in children may be even rarer. Odetola et al. evaluated > 1000 children requiring mechanical ventilation during treatment for severe bacterial meningitis, and found placement of an ICP monitor occurred in only 7% of cases [20] . Other examples where CPP monitoring may be helpful but in whom invasive monitoring is not routinely performed or is contraindicated include children with coagulopathy in the setting of sepsis or liver failure, or while undergoing support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a portable, repeatable, noninvasive means that measures cerebral flow velocities (CBFVs) in the cerebral vasculature. In adult patients, TCDderived parameters have successfully been used to calculate an estimated CPP by several different mathematical approaches [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Two that have been described require only systemic blood pressure monitoring and basic non-continuous TCD data [27, [30] [31] [32] . One method described by Czosnyka et al. calculates an estimated CPP (CPPe) as MAP \u00d7 (diastolic flow (Vd)/mean flow (Vm)) + 14 [27] . In the second method, cerebral CrCP can be determined by plotting the dynamic pressure-flow relationship between systemic blood pressures and TCD flow velocities and determining the x-axis intercept of the linear regression line [30] [31] [32] . Estimated CPP by this method (CrCP/CPPe) is then calculated as MAP \u2212 CrCP [30] [31] [32] . There is a paucity of literature evaluating the use of either of these methods to non-invasively estimate CPP in pediatric patients. We therefore performed the current study to test the hypothesis that CPPe and CrCP/CPPe derived according to these methods would have good agreement with invasively monitored CPP in children.",

Using the second method we evaluated, CrCP/CPPe had good correlation with CPP in 70 adult patients with TBI (r = 0.92) [31] . These authors promoted the use of both of these methods to non-invasively estimate CPP in adult patients based on a good correlation between the invasively measured and estimated CPP. In fact, correlation of CPP and CPPe from our cohort was also reasonably good (r = 0.78). However, since correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another but not the differences between them, it may not be the most appropriate method to assess comparability between a gold standard and new method.",

            "text": "In a recently published paper using continuous TCD recordings to non-invasively estimate CPP in children who had suffered TBI, CPPe overestimated CPP by 19.61 mmHg with wide 95% CI of \u00b1 40 mmHg on Bland-Altman analysis [36] . Our results are similar to this study in that we also identified wide limits of agreement for both the CPPe and CrCP/ CPPe methods (> \u2212 15 to > + 25). Thus, the clinical utility of either method to non-invasively estimate the absolute value of CPP at a single time point in children with TBI also appears to be limited. Some work has previously been done suggesting that TCD parameters may have a role in non-invasively estimating CPP < 50 mmHg in children with severe TBI [40] . Figaji et al. reported that the TCD-derived PI was 0.95 \u00b1 0.17 when CPP was \u2264 50 mmHg and 0.78 \u00b1 0.20 when CPP was \u2265 50 mmHg. However, sensitivity and specificity of the PI to determine a Fig. 4 Linear regression analysis of pressure-flow relationships during [1] , and after [2] use of mannitol, hypertonic saline, and hyperventilation to manage intracranial hypertension. The critical closing pressure (CrCP) is represented by the intercept of the regression line with the x-axis. CrCP for 1 = 60, CrCP for 2 = 72.9. CrCP high due to increased ICP. Increasing CrCP could be partially caused by increased cerebrovascular resistance from reducing partial pressure of carbon dioxide, but a lack of reduction in CrCP is consistent with an ICP that continued to increase despite treatment Fig. 3 Linear regression analysis of pressure-flow relationships before [1] , during [2] , and after [3] use of hypertonic saline to manage intracranial pressure spike. The critical closing pressure (CrCP) is represented by the intercept of the regression line with the x-axis. CrCP for 1 = 19, CrCP for 2 = 39, and CrCP for 3 = 18.8. CrCP likely increased due to ICP increases given that other contributory physiologic variables that contribute to CrCP were unchanged CPP below 50 mmHg was not done due to an inadequate number of paired measurements when CPP was low. In our study, in a limited number of episodes (n = 14), CPPe was noted to have a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91%, and a positive predictive value of 27% to predict CPP < 50 mmHg. The low positive predictive value we report is likely due to the relatively low prevalence of cerebral hypoperfusion < 50 mmHg in this cohort of children. Larger studies can be considered to evaluate if these values of sensitivity and specificity for any of these methods hold with increased measured episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion < 50 mmHg. However, the significant reduction in sensitivity and specificity of this method in a larger number (n = 22) of subjects at a higher target CPP (< 60 mmHg) seen in our study suggests that they likely will not. Identifying a non-invasive means by which to determine cerebral hypoperfusion is thus still necessary.",

As ICP rises and reaches or exceeds the critical closing pressure at the arteriolar level, other contributors to the calculated CrCP become less important and the discrepancy between the estimated and actual CPP decreases [41] . Following decompressive craniotomy, ICP in general is assumed to not reach critical levels. Sample sizes did not allow for matched comparisons at various ICP values between children with and without DC, but a difference in ICP/higher ICP may have contributed to the slightly improved agreement in patients who had not undergone DC. However, wide limits of agreement in this group of children would still prohibit its use clinically. Additionally, bias between the methods was slightly better when the PaCO 2 values were low (30-35 mmHg) and progressively worsened as PaCO 2 values rose (> 45 mmHg). Autoregulation is known to be most effective and CVR highest at lower PaCO 2 values [42, 43] . The overall effect of these factors on measured CBFVs may account for the modest improvement in agreement at relative hypocapnea.",

            "text": "Another important clinical need is the ability to monitor noninvasively, not just at a single point but over time, the actual cerebral perfusion of these critically ill children. The components that contribute to the calculation of the CrCP, and thus, the CrCP/ CPPe include not just the tissue pressure (ICP) but also the cerebrovascular resistance/vasomotor tone (CVR), and the downstream venous pressure [30, 31] . Thus, the calculation of the CrCP/CPPe reflects the net effect of local and systemic physiologic or pathologic alterations on the cerebral circulation. If trended over time, it may be useful to assist in determining an individual's overall response to progressive or improving pathologic states and the effects of therapeutic strategies on the effective cerebral perfusion pressure. In two small experimental animal studies, this has been done successfully. Varsos et al. calculated CrCP during 38 episodes of ICP plateau waves induced by lumbar infusion. ICP increased during infusion on average by 24 mmHg and a concomitant increase in CrCP of 27% from baseline was identified (mean CrCP 51.9 \u00b1 8.76 at baseline ICP; mean CrCP 63.31 \u00b1 10.83 at the top of the plateau waves) [34] . The same author, in a different study, determined that alterations to the calculated baseline CrCP and CrCP/CPPe accurately reflected the overall net effect of changes to ICP, mean arterial pressure, and ventilation in rabbits [44] . Three patients in our cohort had serial TCD examinations around the time of significant pathophysiologic changes and treatment interventions that allowed for the repeated calculation of CrCP and thus CrCP/CPPe. In all 3 children, CrCP and CrCP/CPPe trended in the expected direction based on the measurement of simultaneously captured invasive parameters. This is a very limited sample, however, so the importance of these results must not be overstated. Future studies in larger numbers of children should determine the utility of CrCP calculated non-invasively in this way to monitor for changing physiology and as a means to measure the response to therapeutic interventions in children with acute, severe, neurologic illness.",

Future studies could involve larger groups of children and attempt to capture agreement data with different subsets of patients and determine if CPPe or CrCP/ CPPe can be used to non-invasively predict CPP in some children. Furthermore, this study did not evaluate the techniques to non-invasively estimate CPP in children with disease processes outside TBI. Other disease processes that have different pathophysiologic mechanisms and more diffuse versus heterogeneous neurologic injury may have different levels of agreement.",

            "text": "If any of these studies were to find closer agreement between estimated CPP and invasively measured CPP, other considerations would need to be taken into account before widespread clinical use of the technique began. One limitation of TCD use in general is the considerable variation that can be seen between different operators. It would therefore be imperative that all operators at a single institution would have to undergo regular evaluation to ensure minimal variation in technique and results of their TCD examinations. This would help to ensure accurate and interpretable results when repeated examinations are done on a single patient over time by multiple operators. Furthermore, as CPP is highly dynamic and can fluctuate widely within minutes, improved technology that allows for continuous reliable TCD measurement and subsequent real-time non-invasive CPP calculation in children would be required in order to use the technique as anything other than a one-time screening tool.",
