However, many valid concerns of critics are being overlooked because metrics proponents\u2014including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), and The Lancet\u2014wield far more power than critics. In this Viewpoint, we discuss these criticisms and offer ideas for strengthening accountability of the enterprise. We argue that metrics leadership is more than a technical matter: it is a political and normative concern that bears on the legitimacy of the distribution of power in global health governance. Therefore, the global health metrics enterprise deserves the same kind of critical scrutiny that its backers seek of the policy makers whose decisions they hope to shape.",

Critics argue that the estimates are generated by opaque techniques and are potentially flawed and misleading. Over the long term, they want the world's population to be counted so that \u201ccomplex estimation techniques are not needed\u201d.18 Another concern is that GBD data are updated so frequently that they constitute an overwhelming flood of information for the field of global health. Additionally, observers point out that GBD figures often diverge considerably from country statistics and little effort is made to adjudicate between different sets of estimates. Beyond this, critics raise concerns that GBD estimates are used inappropriately to evaluate progress on goals, such as the SDGs.",

One way this happens is that resource-poor ministries in low-income countries observe global organisations using massive computer power to produce estimates in the absence of data, and thereby conclude that it is not worth investing in their own health information systems.5 A consequence of the neglect of national health information system development is an emphasis on the production of information useful for monitoring progress on objectives that global rather than local organisations deem valuable. Mahajan4 identifies an additional concern: as IHME and other institutions vacuum data19 gathered by organisations in low-income countries to produce and disseminate estimates globally, national governments must rely on these global institutions rather than information they control locally to know their very own populations.",

Farmer23 makes a similar point, noting that, \u201cthe experience of suffering\u2026is not effectively conveyed by statistics or graphs\u201d. Like many medical anthropologists, Adams25 calls for more ethnographic research that gets at everyday realities and that \u201cunseat tendencies toward the tyranny of numbers\u201d in the field of global health.

Critics question this assumption.4 They ask how the indicators and categories they purportedly illuminate came to exist in the first place, viewing these as products of social processes heavily reliant on interpretation. One of the most dramatic effects of metrics, they argue, is to create or alter the very phenomena their developers claim to measure.26, 27, 28 Hacking,29 for instance, speaks of the \u201clooping effects\u201d of classifications, including categories such as autism and schizophrenia. Individuals who know that they have been designated as autistic or schizophrenic might alter their behaviour, and thereby the very meaning of the classifications (sometimes with adverse, at other times with emancipatory effects).",

One reason is the alignment of organisations, the resources at their disposal, and their incentive structures. Global health metrics proponents are among the richest and most powerful organisations in the global health field. The IHME has been able to expand rapidly since its establishment in 2007 due to the availability of resources to produce metrics. Recently, the IHME has moved into areas even beyond health, producing population estimates, traditionally the work of the United Nations Population Division.30 The primary financier is the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which, over time, has provided the IHME with several hundred million dollars of support, and which uses GBD data for its own priority-setting exercises.31\nThe Lancet, the world's most widely read journal publishing on global health, has forged a close relationship with IHME, making a commitment to the regular publication of GBD data. Although driven primarily by the advancement of science, The Lancet, operating in a competitive medical journal market and owned by a large for-profit publishing company, might have incentives that extend beyond knowledge production. These incentives include the maintenance of a high journal impact factor, an objective facilitated by high citation rates for GBD studies. Meanwhile, critics operate with little funding and make their arguments in specialised outlets\u2014especially anthropology, sociology, and development journals\u2014with limited circulation and reaching largely only academic audiences.",

First is to ensure that the global health metrics and the national health information systems agendas advance synergistically. Both of these agendas contribute to the public good. Although not necessarily incompatible, at present the global health metrics agenda, undoubtedly unintentionally on the part of its proponents, might be having adverse effects on the national health information systems agenda. The leaders of the enterprise, national policy makers, and researchers need to find ways to ensure the two agendas strengthen one another.

A positive development is the growing cross-national network of researchers working on GBD: collaborators from 146 countries provided input in the latest iteration.1 Still, the enterprise might be developing in ways that concentrate power rather than foster pluralism.9 At the core of the enterprise are several institutions, the first three of which are based in high-income countries, and the fourth of which derives considerable power from the support of high-income countries: the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (the primary producer of metrics), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (the primary financier), The Lancet (the primary disseminator), and WHO (formerly in competition with but now in alliance with IHME in the production of metrics). As The Lancet editor Richard Horton has argued, \u201cWithout a diverse and vigorously contested field, the discipline of global metrics for global health will likely drift and lose focus on its true purpose\u2014serving communities in countries\u201d.41 These comments were made in 2013, defending the rise of IHME and GBD studies against critics. His point still holds, only now for a different set of actors.",

Just as plurality is to be valued within the metrics enterprise itself, it should also be valued with respect to the kind of knowledge that counts in global health.20, 25 Relatedly, one must keep in mind the contingent nature of the knowledge produced by metrics,26 questioning about what kind of interpretive work goes into the creation of categories and numbers, and whether, once created, these acquire a taken-for-granted legitimacy that might not be warranted.",
