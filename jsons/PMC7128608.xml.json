In Europe, specialized isolation facilities such as \u2018High Level Isolation Units\u2019 are held responsible for the management of cases in a safe clinical environment that minimizes risks for the personnel but allows state-of-the-art critical care [1]. Most often, isolation facilities are located in areas at risk for the occurrence of HIDs such as highly populated cities or are co-located with BSL-4 laboratories and international airports [15]. In contrast, experience gained from VHFs imported to Europe highlighted the fact that suspected cases are often not directly referred to isolation facilities but are encountered in standard hospitals not equipped to provide mid- or long-term care under strict infection control regimens [2], [16]. Hence, patients may need to be relocated to the closest isolation facility available if the clinical conditions allow transportation, although risks for personnel and patients en route must be considered [17].",

Hence, recommendations for ground ambulances affiliated with such facilities are not considered applicable to large outbreaks.

Hence, shortage of equipment or critical care capacity and the sufficient use of dispatch systems to prioritize capacities do not play a major role here as in other mass casualty incidents [20], [21]. However, providing adequate equipment and vehicles to relocate HID patients remains a critical aspect of preparedness as any mode of transport poses a risk to the patient, personnel on board and the public [17], [22].

Despite the increasing role of aircraft in trauma care, their use for repatriation of VHF patients is limited and even prohibited by international regulations [23], [24], [25], [26]. In addition, training of paramedics for biological events and ground ambulances are broadly accessible, although varying in concepts and outcome [27], [28]. Although required by some of the member states evaluated, the absence of specifically equipped ambulances or of an infection control regimen exceeding the use of droplet precautions for staff did not result in secondary cases of imported VHFs to Europe [2], [3], [4], [17]. Hence, and in accordance with international guidelines applicable even to smallpox, specific equipment of ambulances is not considered essential by the EUNID consensus [1]. Also, the US consensus considers special air-handling system equipment an \u2018ideal\u2019 situation, not an absolute condition [19]. Nevertheless, allocation of ambulances for HID transport in reduced resource settings may lead to critical shortage for more common medical emergencies such as trauma care. However, in contrast to mass casualties, focusing on small numbers of patients allows an increased attention to the level of infection control policies applied en route and after a patient was delivered to the respective isolation facility. Although infection control regulations for multi-resistant bacteria or other less contagious agents may be sufficient for VHFs, the SARS outbreak in Canada led to a significant shortage of emergency medical service personnel [22], [29].",

Although the need for reserved or even specifically equipped ambulances is debatable and highly depends on the available resources, data collected depict the awareness for the problems even when specific equipment is not available or recommended nationally. Within the EU, cases can occur in close proximity to countries other than the one initially affected and a patient may have to be relocated to the closest isolation facility available, even if not in the same member state. Hence, besides a harmonized approach defining minimal technical requirements, a legal frame for cross-border relocations is needed (See Table 1\n).",
