During mRNA synthesis, eukaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of critical modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm where they are translated into proteins. These processing events include the addition of a cap structure at the 5 -terminus, the splicing out of introns, the editing of specific nucleotides, and the acquisition of a poly(A) tail at the 3 -terminus. The eukaryotic cap structure found at the 5 -end of mRNAs is critical for the splicing of the capproximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation of mRNAs. 1 Synthesis of the cap structure occurs co-transcriptionnally on nascent mRNAs and involves three enzymatic reactions. First, an RNA 5 -triphosphatase hydrolyzes the gammaphosphate at the 5 -end of the nascent pre-mRNA to generate a 5 -diphosphate end. Second, a RNA guanylyltransferase then transfers a GMP moiety to the diphosphate end of the RNA.

Biochemical studies have shown that cvRtp1 has a greater affinity for PPPi than its natural triphosphorylated RNA substrate. 4 As cvRtp1 has a weak tripolyphosphatase activity, it is tempting to speculate that a non-hydrolyzable PPPi analog would be even more potent. Although the inhibition of the human capping enzyme (HCE) by PPi and PPPi has not been reported, it has to be pointed out that phosphate analogs, such as the FDA-approved anticytomegalovirus drug foscarnet, have already shown their efficiency in clinic. 7 Although PPi and PPPi could not realistically be used as a drug, they could serve as lead compounds for the rational design of novel anti-RTase drugs.

Nonetheless, minor differences between the members of this family can likely be exploited in order to develop antimicrobial agents. Several inhibitors of the GTase activity have been identified. However, most of these inhibitors display a relatively low specificity toward GTases of pathogens. For instance, recent in vitro studies have shown that foscarnet, an antiviral drug that targets the DNA polymerase of human cytomegalovirus, is a potent inhibitor of the GTase reaction. 12 Its mechanism of action is purported to occur through substrate binding inhibition on account of its analogous nature to pyrophosphate (PPi), a product of both the polymerase as well as the RNA guanylyltransferase reaction. Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog approved by the FDA as an antiviral for severe respiratory syncytial virus, Hepatitis C, and other viral infections, is another example of a RNA polymerase inhibitor with pleiotropic activities. 13 Its incorporation during strand synthesis, leading to chain termination or error catastrophe, is one of the modes of action of this antiviral. 13 In its cellular triphosphorylated form, ribavirin can also be used as a substrate by viral GTases. 14 However, RNAs capped with ribavirin are relatively inert to methylation by viral RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferases, thus resulting in mRNAs which are stable but not efficiently translated into viral proteins. 14 The incorporation of ribavirin instead of guanine as a 'pseudo-RNA cap' at the 5 -end of viral RNAs is a landmark demonstration that the viral RNA cap structure itself could act as an antimicrobial target. The use of guanine-N7 methylation-inert cap donor molecules could potentially prove to be an interesting line of research for the development of antimicrobial drugs. However, the ability to synthesize viral RNAs capped by nucleoside analogs in cells and, more importantly, the fate of these RNAs in the cells remain to be assessed.

The use of these non-nucleoside inhibitors leads to the formation of triphosphorylated prematurely terminated RNAs in antiviral assays, by preventing the guanylylation of nascent transcripts, thus effectively targeting the viral RNA capping mechanism rather than the polymerase reaction. 17 This class of inhibitors could be a vital starting point for the development of new drugs directed against the RNA capping enzyme of RSV.

In most eukaryotes, the recruitment of the capping machinery to the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex is dependent on the phosphorylation status of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the polymerase. 19 Moreover, in several micro-organisms, such as S. cerevisiae, the proper recruitment of the various enzymes involved in RNA capping is also fundamentally dependent on protein-protein interactions. 20 These interactions not only ensure the presence of the RNA capping machinery in close proximity to the nascent mRNAs, but are also important for the optimal activity and stability of each protein involved in the RNA capping machinery. For instance, in the budding yeast capping machinery, the GTase binds to the phosphorylated CTD, whereas the RTase enzyme lacks this property. However, the interaction of the RTase with the GTase guides the RTase to the site of RNA transcription. 20 Inhibitors targeting this interaction could prove to be vital for the development of highly selective antifungal agents. Alternatively, as distinct phosphorylation events of the RNA Pol II CTD are associated with RNA capping subunits recruitment, inhibitors targeting the protein-CTD interface could be an interesting line of research for antifungal development. On account of the different functional organization of the capping subunits in mammalian cells and unicellular organisms, side effects would likely be minimal. However, it should be pointed out that such a strategy might not be useful to target the capping machinery of some organisms.
