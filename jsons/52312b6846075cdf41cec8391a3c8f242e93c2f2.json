            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV), which belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, is the most significant mosquito-borne human viral pathogen. There are four serotypes of DENV (types 1-4) identified so far [1] . The DENV genome consists of a 5 0 -capped single-stranded RNA with positive polarity ((+) RNA) of approximately 11 kb in length encoding three structural proteins (core, prM, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, 2A, 2B, 3, 4A, 4B, and 5). Structural proteins are the components of the virus particle, and most, if not all, non-structural proteins participate in viral replication [2, 3] . DENV uses its capped genomic RNA to direct the translation of viral protein to produce more viral RNA progeny and virus particles. The 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTR) flanking coding sequences in the genome contain key RNA elements that control viral translation and replication [4, 5] . However, so far no viral RNA packaging signal has been identified. The DENV genomic RNA is assumed to fold into biologically relevant conformations and to switch between distinct conformations to accomplish its function at different stages of the viral life cycle. Hence, the genomic RNA and its RNA elements are most probably under-going structural rearrangements facilitated by a virus-encoded protein with RNA chaperone activity.",

They generally bind RNA non-specifically and cooperatively to facilitate RNA structural rearrangements in an ATP-independent manner [6] . The RNA chaperone property of a protein can be determined by strand annealing assay, strand displacement assay as well as its ability to rescue the formation of misfolded complex structures of a catalytic RNA, such as hammerhead ribozyme (HHRz) [7, 8] . Some virus-encoded proteins are nonspecific RNA chaperones, including core proteins of Flaviviridae and the nucleocapsid proteins of retroviruses, coronaviruses, and hepatitis delta virus [9] [10] [11] [12] . Apart from their basic nature, no motif specific for RNA chaperones has been identified. Recently, it has been suggested that small, highly basic and flexible protein fragments are a hallmark of active RNA chaperone domains in viral core/nucleocapsid proteins [9, 11] .",

CP is rich in basic residues, about a quarter of the 100 amino acids are either lysines or arginines (Fig. S1 ), and its overall pi value is 22.7. To assess the RNA-binding ability of CP, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using first the 3 0 -stem-loop of dengue genome, i.e., SL(+) (SD2), as the substrate RNA. Almost all SL(+) RNA (0.5 nM) formed a complex with CP (non-refolded form) at concentrations of 40 nM, 100 nM, and 400 nM under low-ionic strength conditions (0.1 M NaCl). The bound SL(+) RNA was retained in the gel well and no RNA-CP complex (RNP) of intermediate mobility was observed (Fig. 1F ). This result demonstrated that a threshold amount of CP appears to be needed to effective aggregate this SL(+) RNA. To assess the RNA-binding specificity of CP, we replaced the SL(+) RNA in the binding assay with different DENV RNA fragments in the size range of 100-300 nt, which were derived from the 5 0 or the 3 0 non-coding region or the coding region of DENV genome. We found that each of these RNA fragments had a CP binding profile similar to that of SL(+) RNA (data not shown). These results showed that CP has a high affinity to RNA and possesses a broad RNA-binding specificity.",

The cleavage of substrate RNA occurred regardless of the removal of CP (Fig. 3D) . Hence, the binding of CP to RNA was no longer required once two RNAs hybridized and adopted the catalytically active structure. This result indicated that CP acts as a bona fide RNA chaperone.",

The C-terminal domain of NS5 is an RDRP that binds specifically to the 5 0 stem-and-loop A (SLA) of DENV genome, and DENV genome circularization enables the translocation of NS5 from SLA to the 3 0 terminus of the RNA genome to initiate the replication process [4] . NS3 is a component of the viral replicase complex [3] , and the helicase domain of NS3 unwinds short 3 0 -tailed dsRNA of DENV and non-DENV sequences in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner [14] . Recombinant proteins corresponding to full-length NS5 protein (NS5) and the helicase domain of NS3 protein (NS3H) were prepared to analyze their putative RNA chaperone activities. The overall pI of NS5 and NS3H is 8.8 and 6.7, respectively. NS5 had a weak yet significant activity in facilitating the trans-cleavage of SUB2 and SUB3 RNAs by RZS RNA (Fig. 3E and F) . We reproducibly observed that NS5 had a weak activity in promoting the hybridization of SUB3m and RZS RNAs (SUBm3 was a cleavage site mutant of SUB3, SD2) (Fig. S5) . Moreover, the RDRP activity of NS5 did not contribute to RNA chaperone activity as a replication-defective mutant of NS5 displayed similar chaperone ability as the wild-type NS5 (data not shown). By contrast, NS3H did not promote the cleavage of SUB2 or SUB3 RNA by RZS RNA (Fig. 3E and F) , and it failed to facilitate the SUBm3/RZS hybrid formation, independently of whether the annealing assay was carried out in the presence or absence of ATP ( Fig. S5 and data not shown) .",

The lack of RNA chaperone activity of NS3 helicase indicates its major role as a helicase in RNA replication. Base on the finding of this study, we speculate that there is strong interaction between DENV genome and the replicase complex during RNA replication. NS3, a component of the replicase complex, unwinds the double-stranded RNA and works together with NS5 to provide RNA template for nucleotide incorporation.

All trans-cleavage reactions were performed at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 10 mM MgCl 2 and detailed reaction conditions were summarized in SD1. RNAs were resolved on a 5% PA-7 M urea gel. 5 0 P and 3 0 P represent the 5 0 -and 3 0 -cleavage products, respectively. are essential for NS5 to exert its RDRP function [4] . Besides the limited chaperone ability of NS5 and its binding on 5 0 SLA, it is speculated that the formation of the replicative form of circular genomic RNA requires concerted RNA-protein interactions among nonstructural proteins as well as host membrane to have efficient RNA replication.",

            "text": "During virion assembly, binding of CP to viral genome forms a nucleocapsid followed by budding into the ER lumen for virion envelopment. Since CP does not display specificity of RNA binding, it could either bind to (+) or (\u00c0) strand of viral RNA. The (\u00c0) strand exists in the (+)/(\u00c0) replication-intermediate form [20] ; thus, the (+) strand is more accessible to CP for nucleocapsid formation. Contributions to the RNA-binding ability of the core protein by the basic domains at both ends [21] and the membrane-associated hydrophobic cleft formed by the internal hydrophobic region suggest a model for nucleocapsid formation [13] . The nucleocapsid within the dengue virion lacks a well-ordered structure and no details pertaining to the interactions between the core protein and RNA or envelope proteins have been reported [22, 23] . Furthermore, the vesicle packets and convoluted membranes within the membranous web structures, which are induced upon virus infection, are the sites for viral RNA replication [3] ; hence, they provide micro environments for both replication and virion formation events to overcome the non-specific RNA binding feature of CP. Since these three tested viral RNA-interacting proteins are targeting the same RNA in carrying out their functions, it is conceivable that there are regulations of RNA affinity among CP, NS3, and NS5 in maintaining the balance among different events in the viral life cycle. manuscript editing.
