The population is divided into several different compartments (i.e., susceptible, infective, recovered, deceased) and specify how agents move across the separate compartments over time.

Compared to the official reports, which showed that the peak number of existing infected cases was 11,869 on April 27, these results indicated that 1) NPIs took in Period II might have reduced about 80% of the daily contacts per people compared to that before COVID-19; 2) owing to the effects of NPIs, the epidemic transmission may mainly have occurred through family contacts .

For an aging society like Japan, the most important prediction is the maximum number of patients who will require medical service. This prediction is of crucial importance to design for policies of COVID-19 containment in Japanese hospitals and to calculate the time period in which they need to be available. Meanwhile, as it is the first time to declare large-scale emergency declarations of infectious disease in Japan, the prediction is of fundamental significance to plan for social countermeasures such as NPIs.",

This method can generate more reliable predictions of the number of existing infected cases than using other methods. Reasons are that, first, we consider that the total confirmed cases are less challengeable for medical service than the existing infected cases. Studies have reported that, about 80% of COVID-19 patients did not need medical treatment, and thus do not exert any burdens on medical service (Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet, 2020a). Second, using the number of RT-PCR receivers to predict the peak incident can display the effectiveness of countermeasure policies. For instance, in Period II, the estimated peak incident is much more serious than the observed fact, meaning that the capacity of daily RT-PCR in Japan cannot satisfy the required numbers. Third, the prediction of peak incident in each period is crucial for the preparation of the minimum number of hospital beds. For instance, based on estimations of the peak incident by Japanese experts, the total hospital beds for COVID-19 patients have increased from about 2,000 in early February to 31,289 in May 2020 (Japan Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare, 2019).",

The biggest reason might be because of the capability of daily RT-PCR, which directly defines the observed confirmed cases. Another reason might be the high level of Japanese medical service. On Jan 28, the Japanese government announced that the COVID-19 epidemic has been defined as \"a designated notifiable disease\" according to the Law of Infectious Disease and Patient Treatment, and medical treatment expenses of COVID-19 patients will be covered by the national budget (Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet, 2020b). Owing to stable and high-qualified medical service, the Japanese society seems to successfully have discharged COVID-19 patients and have avoided collapse of hospital service.",
