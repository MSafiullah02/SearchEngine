In this study, we evaluated the Qiagen ResPlex II V2.0 kit and explored factors influencing its sensitivity. Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens were prospectively collected from pediatric inpatients with lower respiratory tract infections at the time of admission in the Shenzhen Children's Hospital from May 2009 to April 2010. Total nucleic acids were extracted using the EZ1 system (Qiagen, Germany) and 17 respiratory viruses and genotypes including influenza A virus (FluA), FluB, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses (RhV), enteroviruses (EnV), human bocaviruses (hBoV), adenoviruses (AdV), four coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1), and FluA 2009 pandemic H1N1(H1N1-p) were detected and identified by the ResPlex II kit. In parallel, 16 real-time TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR assays were used to quantitatively detect each virus except for RhV. Influenza and parainfluenza viral cultures were also performed. Among the total 438 NPS specimens collected during the study period, one or more viral pathogens were detected in 274 (62.6%) and 201(45.9%) specimens by monoplex TaqMan RT-PCR and multiplex ResPlex, respectively. When results from monoplex PCR or cell culture were used as the reference standard, the multiplex PCR possessed specificities of 92.9-100.0%. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR for PIV3, hMPV, PIV1 and BoV were 73.1%, 70%, 66.7% and 55.6%, respectively, while low sensitivities (11.1%-40.0%) were observed for FluA, EnV, OC43, RSV and H1N1. Among the seven viruses/genotypes detected with higher frequencies, multiplex PCR sensitivities were correlated significantly with viral loads determined by the TaqMan RT-PCR in FluA, H1N1-p and RSV (p=0.011-0.000). The Qiagen ResPlex II multiplex RT-PCR kit possesses excellent specificity for simultaneous detection of 17 viral pathogens in NPS specimens in pediatric inpatients at the time of admission. The sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCR was influenced by viral loads, specimen process methods, primer and probe design and amplification condition.",

            "text": "Rapid and accurate etiologic diagnosis of LRTIs is essential to patient management. Several multiplex RT-PCR-based devices are commercially available for detection and differentiation of a panel of respiratory viral pathogens (Zhang S, et al., 2011) . They are being increasingly used in the clinical setting as a cornerstone technique in the clinical virology laboratory as they possess sensitivities greater than rapid viral antigen testing and test turnaround time shorter than standard respiratory virus culture (Balada-Llasat J M, et al., 2011; Kim S R, et al., 2009; Rand K H, et al., 2011; Schindera C, et al., 2010) . Varying sensitivities have been reported between different devices for specific viral pathogens in different studies (Balada-Llasat J M, et al., 2011; Kim S R, et al., 2009; Rand K H, et al., 2011; Schindera C, et al., 2010) . In this study, we evaluated the ResPlex II V2.0 kit (Qiagen, Germany), which uses a target enriched multiplexing RT-PCR amplification coupled with a suspension array detection, for detection and identification of a panel of respiratory specimens in pediatric inpatients with LRTIs. Clinical accuracy of the ResPlex II assay was validated on a panel of prospectively collected consecutive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens in comparison to viral culture and a monoplex real-time TaqMan RT-PCR. We also correlated the ResPlex II assay sensitivity with viral loads determined by the quantitative, monoplex real-time TaqMan RT-PCR.",

            "text": "Significantly lower sensitivities by the ResPlex II assay were observed especially for FluA, EnV, OC43, RSV and H1N1-p. We observed the following factors which might explain the discrepancies between our and previously reported studies. First, based on the patient populations and reference standards, the test sensitivities could vary significantly. Mak G et al (Mak G C, et al., 2011) reported the sensitivity of ResPlex II for FluA and H1N1-p were only 31.8% and 42.9% when monoplex RT-PCR was used for comparison. However in previous studies in which virus culture or DFA was used as the main reference standard, the sensitivities of ResPlex II were observed to be from 84%-100% (Balada- Llasat J M, et al., 2011; Li H, et al., 2007) . In our pediatric inpatients with lower respiratory tract infections at the time of admission, the monoplex RT-PCR detected significantly more Flu and PIV than in cell culture. Secondly, different extractions vary significantly in quality and quantity of nucleic acid recovery. In our study, nucleic acids were extracted using the Qiagen EZ-1 system for the ResPlex II, a system with reported low quantity and quality of nucleic acid recovery (Tang Y W, et al., 2005; Yang G, et al., 2011) . Finally, the multiplex PCR condition requires careful optimization; any addition or modification of primers/probes may significantly alter the amplification efficiency. In our study, when the target of H1N1-p was added, the sensitivities of ResPlex II plus panel PRE assay dropped for most of the viral targets, especially for FluA detection.",

In our study, among the seven viruses/genotypes detected with higher frequencies, ResPlex II sensitivities correlated significantly with viral loads determined by the TaqMan RT-PCR in RSV, FluA and H1N1-p. In contrast, no viral load correlation was observed in PIV3, hMPV, PIV1 and hBoV. Since viral load did not correlate with lower sensitivities for some of the targets, the PCR amplification and hybridization efficiencies may also play a role. It is reasonable that multiplex PCR sensitivities decreased with decreasing viral load of target virus. In the ResPlex II, primers and probes were designed from the F genome of hMPV in which significant sequence variations were revealed by the recent finding of four geno/ subtypes (Mackay I M, et al., 2006) . Whether the poor correlation between viral load and PCR sensitivity in hMPV is related to the primer/probe design merits further investigation. Varied analytical sensitivities were noticed in other viral targets in a recent study in immunocompromised children (Hayden R T, et al., 2012) .",
