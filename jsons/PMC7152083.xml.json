Mitigation through hardening has only limited use in systems or facilities such as hospitals where open access to the surrounding community is the hallmark of their operations. In these circumstances, a resilient system capable of flexing to accommodate damage and the ability to maintain or even expand current operations will make that system ultimately more secure. These efforts are solidly based within the community and their importance is emphasized by policy and supporting documentation from Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-8: National Preparedness, FEMA, the Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and The Joint Commission (formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, or JCAHO).",

This may include hardening structures in earthquake zones, protecting and monitoring the food chain and drinking water systems, and physically securing and protecting nuclear power plants. In these cases, resiliency may come too late to prevent illness and death in large numbers of patients, and planners should target hardening to whatever degree is practically and financially feasible.7 The threats of nuclear, radiological, chemical, and biological attacks present new challenges for emergency planners. The potentially covert nature of the attacks, the wide variety of possible agents (including contagious agents), and soft civilian targets make planning efforts exponentially more difficult than in the past.

Fusion centers have been implemented in jurisdictions across the United States.15\n,\n16 It is imperative that first responders and hospitals receive notification at the earliest indication of a contagious biological attack. Early notification allows state, regional, and local communities to implement appropriate responses that provide isolation, treatment, prophylaxis, and stockpiling and staging of federal resources, which, when rapidly implemented, could contain a potentially widespread event. This intelligence sharing must become a larger part of mitigation efforts aimed at also limiting the impact of natural and human-made disasters. The elevated status of intelligence within the National Incident Management System (NIMS) establishes the importance of early and effective intelligence sharing. The challenge is to establish these sharing relationships before a disaster by incorporating them into an ongoing hazard monitoring process, drills, exercises, and day-to-day activities to ensure that this critical resource is operational when needed to mitigate the consequences of a disaster.17 A similar analogy can be made with the early warning given to the medical community when a surveillance system detects an unusual cluster of illnesses, which triggers an investigation leading to increased awareness, training, laboratory recognition, and possible identification of a sentinel case long before the initial diagnosis may be confirmed at a physician\u2019s office or health care facility.",

Access to several Toronto area hospitals was significantly limited for several months because of illness, quarantined staff, and concerns about contamination. The economic costs to the city of Toronto were in the billions of dollars. Hospitals and their communities were thrown into a complex mitigation and prevention crisis. Like SARS, the steady spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia since 2012 poses similar threats and has disproportionately affected health care workers, who remain most vulnerable to contagious emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.",

During the fall of 2002, the U.S. government requested that all states prepare for a smallpox attack. The preparations called for each state to present plans to vaccinate all persons within the state, within a 10-day period, starting with health care workers.25 Each facility and community needs to look at the risk of a disease, the effect of vaccination on health care workers, and the ability to maintain continuity of care. One outcome of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was that several organizations, including the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommended that health care workers be mandated to receive yearly influenza vaccinations, which helps to minimize the risk that they will transmit influenza to high- and low-risk patients and bring influenza home to their families. If properly informed and vaccinated, health care workers could respond and treat patients without risk to themselves or their families. The availability of a vaccine and the ability to mass-vaccinate the majority of the population should be considered in all community response plans. The plans for both SARS and pan-influenza now need to address the availability and possible stockpiling of antiviral agents as well as procedures for mass vaccination of the population, if a vaccine were to become available.",

Communities must also look at the continuity of medical care as a community-wide issue and not just emphasize the hospital or emergency medical services aspects of medical care. The loss of community-based clinics, private medical offices, nursing homes, dialysis units, pharmacies, and visiting nurse services can significantly increase the number of patients seeking care at hospitals during a mass casualty event. Risk communication and education specifically aimed at protecting the affected population can help prevent surges of medical patients.50\n",

HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in FY2010 to $255 million in FY2014, including a one-third cut in the FY2014 omnibus.56 HPP provides financial incentives to ensure that hospitals are able to coordinate, cooperate, and reduce loss of life during an emergency. The program allowed the coalition in Boston to practice two 24-hour disaster simulations involving several area hospitals before the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. The planning and efficiency of the hospitals after the attack were major factors in saving the lives of the 264 individuals injured in the bombings, and there were no additional deaths after the three on-site fatalities.57 The loss of an estimated 46,000 state and local public health jobs since 200858 also has the potential to damage the progress made in all-hazards preparedness since 9/11. With little prospect of increased national funding in the immediate future, it is necessary for local communities to develop sustainability strategies to ensure every dollar is well spent in helping their communities prepare for disasters.59 The CDC Capability 10: Medical Surge publication encourages the widespread collaboration and allocation of resources in community-wide surge capacity efforts and has been helpful in focusing these efforts in a realistic and operational manner.60\n",
