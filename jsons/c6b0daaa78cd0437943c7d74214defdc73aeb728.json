Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether RVP positive testing is correlated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. Results: Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP.

Presentations can vary, ranging from failure to extubate to stridor and respiratory distress. Acute processes can arise from infectious processes and can mimic static airway lesions. In clinically complex scenarios, our institution uses rapid viral testing to help establish the clinical picture and determine the urgency of intervention as acute viral respiratory infection can increase perioperative risk of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, reintubation. Thus, a positive test may lead to medical management with steroids and close observation whereas a negative test may result in earlier operative intervention. We sought to explore these practices by examining the peri-operative outcomes of patients undergoing DLB with a recent history of viral testing. Interestingly, our study showed no association between respiratory viral positivity and increased complications among children undergoing inpatient DLB.

This study, with data on both symptoms and objective RVP assessments, as well as an analysis of the time interval between viral infection and bronchoscopy was designed to address these limitations. We found that symptom-based URTI criteria were met in 20.5% of encounters compared to a URTI diagnosis rate of 45.5% when RVP was used. Interestingly, 25.0% of RVP positive encounters were deemed URTIs based on symptoms alone and 16.7% of RVP negative encounters met symptom criteria for URTI. As a result, symptom-based URTI definitions do not appear to be a reliable measure for estimating RVP findings. The relatively low rate of symptom-based diagnosis compared to RVP-based diagnosis could be due to the RVP's ability to identify the DNA of a viral pathogen that is present but not causing clinically concerning symptoms. The low correlation between the two tests might be a result of the symptoms being caused by a disease process other than upper respiratory tract infection in the hospitalized patients. Furthermore, the symptom-based diagnosis results could be confounded by comorbid conditions and are limited by what was documented in the electronic medical record. In another study, Parnis et al. found that just 4.8% of patients that reported symptoms had a virus isolated on an immunofluorescence assay. Neither the patients who had URTI in the preceding 6 weeks nor the patients who tested positive for a viral pathogen had an increased probability of anesthetic complications [6] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 168, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1664, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "DLBs are commonly performed at our tertiary pediatric hospital, which may have contributed to the low complication rate. Airway instrumentation such as foreign body removal induces mucosal trauma, which may lead to postoperative complications. Two-thirds of patients did not require airway implementation beyond DLB, which may have contributed to overall low major complication rate. The treatment planning required for those patients who were found to have structural airway anomalies may have contributed to the 11-day median length of stay seen in this cohort. This study has several limitations. First, the retrospective nature of this study limits the characterization of perioperative outcomes to what is available in the medical record. In this study, patients were excluded if they did not have an RVP recorded within 6 weeks of DLB, were readmitted close to birth, required a tracheostomy, or had multiple surgical interventions beyond the airway. This was to create a sample that better represented those undifferentiated patients who present to the hospital with respiratory distress and do not have extremely complex healthcare needs that could contribute to adverse surgical outcomes. In doing so, our limited sample size may not have sufficient power to show any associations between RVP positivity and surgical complications should they exist. The outcomes of this study were not intended to apply to medically complex children or patients with known airway abnormalities. However, DLBs were performed in select patients for whom RVP was positive when medically indicated, specifically for those patients whose overall status warranted a surgical procedure despite a known URTI. Surgeons often elect to proceed to the operating room in order to visualize the patient's airway and determine the etiology of obstruction. In this way, this study population does not represent patients presenting for elective surgery for whom surgery is delayed due to suspected URTI. Additionally, only patients who had an RVP taken were compared. The decision to order RVP testing is typically made by emergency department personnel or primary treatment team. These patients received this test because there was a concern for infection causing acute respiratory distress, although RVP is not typically ordered for straightforward URTI. RVP is deferred in patients with high suspicion for structural abnormalities or known airway pathology and low concern for viral illness. Patients with positive RVPs are spared of inappropriate antibiotics and receive proper transmission-based precautions to prevent spread of infections [13, 14] . If the RVP is negative, the provider must consider alternative etiologies leading to respiratory distress. It is possible that patients in both groups had a bacterial or viral pathogen not tested for on the RVP. It is also expected that there were patients who received DLB but were not able to be included because the RVP test was not administered.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2621, "end": 2625, "text": "[13,",

A Film Array Respiratory Viral Panel PCR (FARVPP) (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), which is a realtime PCR test was used to detect the following pathogens: Adenovirus, Coronavirus, Human Major perioperative airway complications (intraoperative and immediate postoperative) were examined and consisted of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, reintubation postoperatively, emergent tracheostomy, cardiac arrest, and death. Laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and reintubation were identified using reported events in the anesthesia record. Minor airway complications were examined and defined as oxygen desaturation and changes in the required respiratory support over the perioperative period. Oxygen desaturation was defined as peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) less than 90% at any time during the case. Baseline respiratory support requirements (nasal cannula, CPAP, ventilator, etc.) at the beginning of the perioperative period were reviewed, and compared to the requirements both in the PACU setting and the inpatient service to ascertain whether the patient had an increase, decrease, or no change in requirement after the surgical procedure.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "management of children with stridor and respiratory distress.
