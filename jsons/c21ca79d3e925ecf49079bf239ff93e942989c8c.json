Acute respiratory viral diseases claim over 4 million deaths and cause millions of hospitalizations in developing countries every year. Emerging viruses, especially the RNA viruses, are more pathogenic since most people have no herd immunity. The RNA viruses can adapt to the rapidly changing global and local environment due to the high error rate of their polymerases that replicate their genomes. Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is determined as an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan. Herein we discuss emerging and reemerging respiratory viral infections till to SARS-CoV-2.",

Pathogens of these infections appear for the first time or they have existed previously and spread rapidly among the population and new geographical areas. The emergence of novel human pathogens and reemergence of several diseases is of particular concerns of the current century [1] . There is a dominance of zoonotic infections, mostly originating in wildlife, among emerging health threats with a rate of 70%. Pathogens first emerge in themselves and rapidly mutate, which result in a transmission in humans with subsequent dissemination. According to the extent of the transmission, epidemic outbreaks may occur and progress to a pandemic. Diseases that reappear after a significant decline are called as reemerging diseases. Reemergence may occur due to a breakdown in public health measures or the appearance of new strains of organisms [2] . Respiratory infections with epidemic and pandemic potential that cause a global burden have plagued people since the beginning of human history. In this review, the epidemic and pandemic, emerging and reemerging respiratory viruses are summarized in Table. Most emerging viruses come from animals and are zoonotic or vector-borne diseases belonging to the families Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae. Community-acquired respiratory viruses are critical pathogens such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, cause millions of deaths and hospitalizations around all over the world every year [3, 4] .",

It belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Influenza is an enveloped virus with negative-stranded RNA consists of 8 segments. There are 4 different types; A, B, C, and D [7, 10] . Influenza A virions possess 2 surface glycoproteins-the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)-which exert different functions. Eighteen hemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase subtypes are known to exist in nature [10] . They can infect birds and mammals, including man. Influenza B is restricted to human horde. Influenza C is isolated from humans, pigs and dogs [10] . Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and human population in all age groups [11] .

The surface antigenic glycoproteins are subject to 2 main types of antigenic variation, namely: antigenic shift and antigenic drift. The antigen shift is an abrupt, significant change in an influenza A virus that leads to new HA and/or new HA and NA proteins in influenza viruses that infect man. The interruption can lead to a novel influenza A subtype in humans. These are small changes (or mutations) in the genes of influenza viruses that can guide to alterations in the surface proteins of the virus: HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase). The HA and NA surface proteins of influenza viruses are \"antigens\", which implies that they are seen by the immune system and can activate an immune response, including the production of antibodies that can halt the contagion. The changes associated with antigen drift occur continuously over time as the virus replicates.",
