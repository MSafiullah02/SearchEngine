Jijoye cells had a large amount of class I and class II MHC antigens, whereas these antigens were less expressed on P3HR-1 cells. On a subline of P3HR-1 K cells the expression of class I antigen markedly diminished and class II antigen was undetectable. On the other hand, Jijoye, P3HR-1, and P3HR-1 K cell lines were confirmed to be Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nonproducer, low producer, and high producer, respectively. The chemical activation of EBV genome by treating P3HR-1 cells with 12-0-tetradecanyl phorbol-13 acetate (TPA) and n-butyrate resulted in inhibition of the expression of class I and II antigens, while the addition of retinoic acid, an inhibitor of virus replication, blocked the decrease in the MHC antigen expression. These findings suggested that there might be an inverse correlation between the virus production and the expression of class I and II MHC antigens.",

Virus infection often modulates the cell surface expression of class I (7, 16, 17) and class II MHC antigens (12) . Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) selectively infects and transforms human resting B cells expressing both class I and class II antigens of MHC. Usually EBVtransformed B lymphoblastoid lines and Burkitt's lymphoma lines express human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and can be killed by MHC class I-specific cytotoxic T cell lines (18) . The Burkitt's lymphoma subline of P3HR-1 cells has been obtained by cloning a high virus-producing cell from the parental Jijoye cells (6). The P3HR-1 cells express only low level of MHC class II antigen, in contrast to the parental Jijoye (19) . In this paper we present the various patterns of MHC antigen expression in sublines of a Jijoye-P3HR-1 family and discuss the relationship between the MHC antigen expression and EBV production.",

In the next experiment, the quantitative analysis of their surface expression was done with the aid of a flow cytometer (Fig. 2) . Jijoye cell line was the most reactive with anticlass I and class II antibodies among three cell lines. P3HR-1 cells had a lesser amount of class I and II antigens than Jijoye cells. Especially, P3HR-1 K cells expressed the smallest amount of class I antigen, and its intensity of the peak fluorescence was about one-eighth of that of Jijoye. Class II antigen was undetectable on P3HR-1 K cells by two kinds of monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with the different antigenic determinant sites of class II molecule. On the other hand, there was no difference among these three cell lines in the expression of transferrin receptors detected by a monoclonal antibody (data not shown).",

After activation of the EBV genome by treatment with TPA and n-butyrate for 3 days, the frequency of fluorescence-positive cells in P3HR-1 K cell culture increased up to about 40 % and also a significant number of fluorescence-positive cells appeared in P3HR-1 line.

Although virus structural proteins have been detected in only a limited number of cells even in virus producer P3HR-1 K cells (Table 1) , a significant number of virus DNA copies are synthesized in these cells (1). Further, chemical treatment markedly enhances the copy number of virus genomes per cell (4).
