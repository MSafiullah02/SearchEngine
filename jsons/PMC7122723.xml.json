Similarly, the native lymphatics and the neural supply to lung allografts are disrupted at the time of transplantation. The impact of these disruptions on lung transplant outcomes remains unclear, though it is possible that these changes lead to higher susceptibility to the development of pulmonary edema and infections, worse airway clearance, and ineffective cough [6]. Lastly, the lung allografts have higher exposure to immunogenic compounds, as compared to other organs, by ventilation. The ongoing exposure to various inhaled injurious agents may also predispose lung allografts to develop chronic rejection.",

It is manifested by the early development of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxemia with a reduced PaO2/FiO2 ratio (<300), without an identifiable cause. The diagnosis of PGD is one of the exclusions. The other causes of graft dysfunction such as infection, hyperacute rejection, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pulmonary venous anastomotic obstruction should be excluded [8]. PGD is thought to be due to overexuberant infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells in response to transplant-mediated immune signals from endothelium, epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. The interaction between these cells leads to release of cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates, and proteolytic enzymes leading to graft dysfunction [9]. The severity of PGD falls along a spectrum, ranging from mild dysfunction to severe lung injury. PGD can affect 10\u201325% of transplanted patients, and the 30-day mortality can be as high as 50%. Furthermore, severe PGD after lung transplantation has been associated with development of subsequent chronic rejection and graft dysfunction [10].",

Current imaging modalities are not diagnostic but may reveal useful findings such as infiltrates and ground-glass opacities [32, 33].

Histologically, ACR is characterized by the presence of perivascular and/or peribronchiolar (grade B) lymphocytes in the absence of infectious etiologies [32, 34, 35]. Risk factors for ACR include the number of HLA mismatches between donor and recipient, although it is unclear which specific HLAs have more impact. Other reported risk factors are age, with older patients having more rejection, immunosuppressive regimen used (tacrolimus regimens reject less), other genetic factors such as IL-10 production, and documented GERD.

Similarly, the transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis remain at an elevated risk for development of gastrointestinal malignancies [49].

Lung transplant recipients have one of the shortest survival rates among other solid organ recipients, due to some unique characteristics of the lung allograft, including its unique blood supply and risk for ischemia, disruption of the native lymphatics and the neural supply during the transplant surgery, and exposure to immunogenic entities via ventilation. Among noninfectious complications, PGD, VTE, and rejection are the most important ones. CLAD affects most patients long term and remains a significant clinical concern and contributor to early mortality in lung transplant recipients. Lung transplant recipients are also at increased risk for a variety of malignancies, due to their underlying disease, comorbidities, and immunosuppressed status; thus they require vigilant monitoring and screening for cancer. Infectious complications (i.e., bacterial, fungal, viral) are also important contributors to morbidity and mortality, with bacterial pneumonias and CMV most commonly seen. Patients require multidisciplinary and intensive follow-up and aftercare, ongoing vigilance, early recognition and treatment, and open and frequent communication between recipients, caregivers, and healthcare team providers.",
