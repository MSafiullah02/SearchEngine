Identification of early gastric cancer enables curative endoscopic or surgical resection, whereas identification of extensive gastric intestinal metaplasia enables those patients to be placed into endoscopic surveillance programmes 6,7 . We do not have evidence to suggest that those under surveillance for extensive intestinal metaplasia or other gastric cancer risk factors (for example, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, alcohol consumption or family history of gastric cancer) will be greatly affected by postponing their scheduled endoscopy. In fact, for these patients, the international endoscopy community is still struggling to agree on the appropriate surveillance intervals. Clinical trials are being conducted to better determine which patients require more intense surveillance and which patients can be released from surveillance. Thus, rescheduling the screening of these patients within a reasonable timeframe (for example, <6 months), might not substantially affect their prognosis. Interestingly, however, investigators have reported that delayed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in FOBT-positive individuals from countries with intermediate risk of gastric cancer, might lead to missed early diagnosis and negatively affect survival 6 .",

In this context, even substantial delays in colonoscopy are unlikely to affect the outcome for patients as the additional efficacy of such surveillance has been downgraded by epidemiological data 8 . In a large retrospective cohort study from the UK evaluating the effectiveness of post-polypectomy colonoscopy surveillance on incident colorectal cancer, Cross et al. reported that, compared with the general population, CRC incidence without surveillance was similar among low-risk and intermediate-risk groups, but significantly higher in the high-risk group. However, a possible exception is the need for early colonoscopy surveillance following complex polyp resection (for example, endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection) or following endoscopic management of early gastric cancer because these patients have been shown to be at high-risk for residual or recurrent disease 9, 10 . Delays for endoscopic surveillance are now common owing to endoscopy units temporarily suspending such procedures, a lack of endoscopy personnel to perform these procedures as many have been assigned to other medical wards to care for patients with COVID-19 or are sick or isolating themselves, or because patients decide to stay away from hospitals. These surveillance procedures will need to be rescheduled as early as possible, especially high-risk cases, such as those with known high-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer on histology, or with a positive margin at surgical resection.",

To reduce health-care personnel exposure, most endoscopy units have implemented a policy that only essential and fully trained endoscopy personnel should be present in endoscopy cases 1 . This approach most often leaves trainees outside the endoscopy suite, and the timeline for their return to full time endoscopy training is unknown. Justifiably, trainees fear that their endoscopy skills will be diminished during their time away from the endoscope. However, we must remember that gastrointestinal endoscopy is not simply a technical discipline, it is also cognitive. Thus, we can look at this situation as an opportunity for our trainees to further develop their cognitive endoscopic skills. Training programmes can be adjusted during this unique time with increased use of online learning and the encouragement of endoscopy videos and technical training videos 1 . If feasible, use of animal labs and/or endoscopy simulators can also be advantageous for our trainees. Where appropriate, trainees might be given the option to participate in select endoscopy cases such as haemostasis in gastrointestinal bleeding, removal of an ingested foreign body or other therapeutic endoscopy cases in patients thought to be at low-risk of COVID-19.",
