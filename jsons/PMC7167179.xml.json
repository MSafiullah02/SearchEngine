            "text": "Surgery of the pancreas in dogs and cats can be undertaken for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Pancreatic biopsy can facilitate diagnosis of disorders such as acute and chronic pancreatitis, and neoplasia. Pancreatitis can be difficult to diagnose accurately ante\u2010mortem because no diagnostic test has perfect sensitivity and specificity, but histological examination has been suggested as the gold standard for diagnosis in dogs (Watson 2004), cats (DeCock et al.\n2007) and humans (Etemad & Whitcomb 2001). Several surgical techniques have been described for pancreatic biopsy in dogs and cats. Suture fracture and blunt dissection/ligation techniques have been described using both lesion\u2010targeted and anatomically targeted (randomly chosen) biopsy sites (Allen et al.\n1989, Cornell 2012). In one study comparing outcome in healthy dogs using either suture fracture or dissection and ligation for open surgical biopsy, more severe inflammation was apparent histologically in the suture fracture group when necropsied at 7 days post surgery although the clinical relevance was not clear (Allen et al.\n1989). One other study described suture fracture for open surgical biopsy in healthy cats, and found no histological evidence of pancreatitis at necropsy 4 weeks postoperatively (Lutz et al.\n1994). Clamshell biopsy using cup biopsy forceps has also been reported in healthy adult dogs but these cases were euthanased at the end of surgery without necropsy so no assessment of postoperative effect could be made (Cordner et al.\n2010).",

            "text": "Postoperative complications of pancreatic surgical biopsy were well documented in humans when it was the standard approach (Schultz & Sanders 1963, Lightwood et al.\n1976); however, since the 1990s operative biopsy has largely been replaced by endoscopic and ultrasound\u2010guided biopsy/aspiration. There is one published study evaluating reliability of needle aspiration (from two sites) under ultrasound guidance as a less invasive method for collecting pancreatic samples in dogs (Cordner et al.\n2010). However, only 18 of 27 (66 \u00b7 7%) aspirates yielded cytology smears considered to be of diagnostic quality and this technique has not come into widespread clinical use. In humans, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is considered superior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in detecting pancreatic masses, and allows precise placement of a needle into suspicious lesions. EUS\u2010guided fine needle aspirate is the principal technique applied to obtain cytological diagnosis of malignancy versus other pathology (Chang et al.\n1997, Vazquez\u2010Sequeiros 2007, Hassan & Hawes 2012). Although EUS has been briefly discussed in dogs and cats (Gaschen et al.\n2003, Schweighauser et al.\n2009) it has not come into general clinical use.",

            "text": "The majority of the reports of postoperative complications following pancreatic surgery in dogs and cats relate to partial pancreatectomy and tumour resections (Mehlhaff et al.\n1985, Dunn et al.\n1993, Tobin et al.\n1999, Polton et al.\n2007, Wouters et al. 2011). There is one published experimental study investigating complications of open surgical pancreatic biopsy in clinically healthy cats where none developed biopsy related complications (Lutz et al.\n1994). Cordner et al. (2010) documented the effect of pancreatic aspiration and biopsy on serum pancreatic enzyme concentrations in healthy animals but these were used for a non\u2010recovery surgery teaching laboratory, which ruled out postoperative assessment. Recent studies have focussed more on laparoscopic biopsy in cats and dogs. An experimental study compared trauma induced by standard endoscopic instruments and harmonic scalpel biopsy (Barnes et al.\n2006). Each method was used in six healthy dogs and necropsy carried out at either 4 or 14 days postoperatively. No clinically apparent complications were seen in either group at 14 days although increased pancreatic inflammation and adhesions were appreciable in the harmonic scalpel group. Laparoscopy\u2010assisted biopsy has been described in 20 clinical patients, however, procedural details and postoperative progress were not provided (Webb & Trott 2008). Laparoscopic biopsy in six normal cats using a 5\u2010mm punch biopsy forceps with two teeth identified mild adhesions (two of six) and neovascularisation (three of six) at a second surgery 1 month later (Cosford et al.\n2010). These authors also described microscopic evidence of a focal pancreatitis or steatitis in five of six cats; these changes were interpreted as normal reparative processes after the biopsy injury.",

Databases from two referral institutions were searched for client\u2010owned animals undergoing pancreatic surgical biopsy as part of an exploratory abdominal surgery. Data retrieved included signalment, pancreatic biopsy technique, additional procedures performed during the same anaesthetic, histopathological findings and complications over a 10\u2010day postoperative period. Complications were considered any adverse event occurring in the first 10 days postoperatively, as described in the contemporaneous records, identified on laboratory testing or diagnostic imaging. Complications were grouped as those most likely related to the underlying disease, and those most likely relating to the surgical procedure. There are currently no standard criteria for identification of postoperative pancreatitis, and no consistent criteria reported in previous veterinary studies, whether clinical or experimental. On the basis of the lack of definitive criteria, patients with suggestive clinical signs, serum biochemistry results or diagnostic imaging findings were considered to have \u201csuspected postoperative pancreatitis\u201d. Cases were excluded if they did not have full histological reports for all biopsy samples or where clinical records were incomplete. Cases undergoing major abdominal surgery such as hepatic lobectomy in conjunction with pancreatic biopsy were also excluded, as were those euthanased within the first 72 hours of surgery based on the severity of the pre\u2010existing disease and/or identification of a poor prognosis from histological reports.",

Haematology showed mild neutrophilia and mildly increased alkaline phosphatase with no other abnormalities. A dog which had only a pancreatic biopsy and a gall bladder aspirate performed became lethargic, pyrexic, developed peripheral oedema, ascites and abdominal pain all within 48 hours of surgery. Abdominal ultrasound in this patient identified changes consistent with generalised septic peritonitis, and blood samples showed neutrophilia, hypoalbuminaemia and increased hepatic enzyme activities. Abdominal cytology was consistent with septic peritonitis but without evidence of gastrointestinal leakage. The owners elected euthanasia but declined a necropsy. This was the dog whose biopsy was collected by crushing pancreatic tissue with a haemostat, creating a zone of necrotic tissue at the biopsy site within which there was a ligature of braided suture material. It was considered possible in this case that peritonitis was a sequel to postoperative pancreatitis. Two dogs and one cat had abdominal pain, nausea and poor appetite lasting 1 to 6 days after surgery thought to reflect post\u2010surgical pancreatic complications and pancreatitis although this was not confirmed. One dog which had multiple small and large intestinal biopsy samples collected developed generalised septic peritonitis postoperatively with pyrexia, anorexia, vomiting, leucocytosis, hypoalbuminaemia and a septic abdominal exudate confirmed on abdominocentesis. Although no necropsy was performed, abdominal cytology suggested leakage from a gastrointestinal biopsy site. Four patients had pre\u2010existing vomiting, nausea and anorexia which continued to some degree immediately postoperatively and was considered due to underlying disease processes (gastroduodenal ulceration in one dog and three cases of feline triaditis).",
