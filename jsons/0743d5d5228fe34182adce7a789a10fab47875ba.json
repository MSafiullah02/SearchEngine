            "text": "A quantitative risk assessment depends on there being some reliable data available to the analyst. A quantitative bioterrorism risk assessment would need data or well-informed judgments on the intent of terrorist groups or individuals, their technical capabilities, the attributes of pathogens or toxins that might be used in a biological attack, target characteristics, and the occurrence (frequency) of various attack scenarios. While data regarding target and bioagent characteristics are available, to a lesser or greater extent, data on bioterrorist intent and the frequency of different types of attacks are just about nonexistent. This data gap apparently stems from the rarity of bioterrorist events and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) terrorism database, which is the largest unclassified one of its kind, revealed that out of 383 incidents in which biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological agents were used by criminals or terrorists during 1900-2001, only 77 biological \"events\" (i.e., episodes involving the deliberate use of a biological agent to harm people) were perpetrated. Of these, just four post-1945 events generated more than 10 casualties [1] . The successful implementation of a bioterrorism act would require the achievement of several critical steps by the terrorist: acquiring precursor virulent biological seed cultures, growing biological agents in culture, process the agents into a form that can be effectively disseminated, improvise an agent delivery device, and carry out the dissemination effectively to cause mass casualties [2] . Even when the appropriate motivation for such an attack exists, an actual effective attack can only be carried out once each of these obstacles has been overcome. Obtaining the appropriate microorganism to initiate an event requires access, as well as knowledge. Restrictions in distribution of potential bioterrorist agents have reduced such accessibility. In addition, the most appropriate strain must be selected. It is speculated that one reason for the lack of success at disseminating anthrax by the cult Aum Shinrikio was the inadvertent selection of a nonpathogenic strain of Bacillus anthracis [2] .",

Yet some authors claim restrictions are already too restrictive, and may have adverse outcomes [4] . Efforts to monitor comprehensively all bioscience research that has potentially destructive applications would subsume huge swaths of science, gravely tax civilian research resources, and could discourage scientists from pursuing advances in fields important to medicine and agriculture, fields we urgently need to advance in order to address the grave vulnerabilities currently imposed by bioweapons [3] .",

A vulnerability analysis seeks to identify a valuable asset (i.e., a target) at risk of a bioterrorist attack and to conceptualize various ways in which it is vulnerable to such an attack (i.e., various attack scenarios). Accordingly, what might have been predicted in the case of anthrax was that the US mail system could not only be used as a means to deliver anthrax, but also that a letter containing anthrax spores could spread spores among mail workers and to other recipients of mail besides the intended victims, through transfer of spores from the original letter to 1.2.

Although category B agents can be transmitted by these routes, they usually cause only short-term vomiting and diarrhea, with a relatively quick recovery. Present public water treatment methods, as well as the boiling of water and cooking of food, are highly effective in neutralizing many biological agents. Contaminating a water or food supply effectively would require large amounts of toxin and bacteria to overcome any dilution factor. However, a recent study warns of the United States' vulnerability to such an attack based on very centralized food processing and distribution methods over large areas. Likely agents are botulinum toxin, Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae. The proposed use of botulinum toxin to contaminate a public water source is of questionable efficacy as the amount of botulinum toxin needed to effectively negate any dilution factor would be enormous, as well as the fact that it is naturally deactivated in fresh water within 3-6 days and within 20 min of standard water treatment. In terms of contamination of a food supply, it should be noted that the toxin is inactivated by heating food to 85\u00b0C [8] .",

The recent anthrax letters resulted in 11 cases of cutaneous anthrax causing significant disruption and fear in postal services and mail handlers. Current studies suggest that thorough washing with soap and water is sufficient to overcome even this threat. Currently, with the exception of anthrax, none of the category A agents have environmental stability after release, especially outdoors [8] . Table 1 summarizes the dissemination techniques employed so far in bioterrorism events [2] . The most important risks associated with pre-event smallpox vaccination program are the adverse events associated with significant morbidity and those for which there are no screening criteria to reduce risk. On the basis of these criteria, post-vaccinial encephalitis and the newly appreciated cardiac complications, especially myopericarditis, are of greatest concern [6] . The risk-benefit ratio associated with pre-event smallpox vaccination program would depend on several factors, including mainly the probability for an event and the potential impact of the event, which in turn is largely determined by the site attacked and means of dispersion. One stochastic model, for example, has shown pre-event vaccination of health-care workers proves lifesaving if the probability of a building attack exceeded 0.22 or if the probability of a high-impact airport attack exceeded 0.002. However, from a national policy standpoint, at the \"breakeven\" thresholds, the policy implications of vaccination are not equivalent to the policy implications of forgoing vaccination. Forgoing prior vaccination means risking higher losses in an attack for a high probability (for instance 0.78) that there will be no attack and no deaths. In contrast, instituting prior vaccination ensures that losses will be lower, should an attack occur, but requires acceptance of the certainty of many vaccine-related deaths and considerable morbidity [9] .",

The goal of this approach is to develop a parsimonious and tractable characterization of the problem space for the purpose of surveillance system design, one that will facilitate both design of systems and the associated research in public health surveillance that supports system design. The consequence is that a designer feels confident that as long as clear specifications for detection of one threat in a category are met, the resulting system can detect any threat from the category.

In the smallpox case, it is unclear how much residual immunity remains today as a result of past vaccination programs; those vaccinated 25-30 years ago are unlikely to possess complete immunity and a significant proportion may develop less severe forms of the disease, potentially changing the dynamics of transmission. Allowing for past immunity levels is therefore critical when estimating R 0 from historical data. Historically, most infections occurred in terization are: (1) focusing more attention on a smaller, but more comprehensive set of threats, (2) identifying equivalent threats that may be caregivers to symptomatic individuals, whether in households or hospitals variety of digital and paper formats. Spatial representation of data is particularly valuable for assessing environmental exposure [10] . detailed data on demographics and human mobility into spatially explicit models offers one method by which such extrapolation can be made more reliable, but the scale of changes mean that much uncertainty will inevitably remain. With such uncertainty, it is critical that risk assessment studies use modern statistical methods to obtain the best possible parameter estimates from historical data, while allowing for changes in the last 30 years. However, historical data are less relevant for some key parameters -such as the likely scale of a bioterrorist attack, how rapidly the disease would be recognized, and the ability of public health authorities to respond. Furthermore, it is unclear how population behavior would change in the face of an epidemic. Before recognition of the outbreak, would individuals in the latter stages of prodrome have more or fewer contacts, compared with their historical counterparts? Once smallpox is identified, will people voluntarily restrict their movements, or attempt to flee urban centers? These factors need to be explored with robust analysis of the sensitivity of model results and predicted optimal controls to parameter assumptions [12] .",

Optimality is principally the minimization of mortality and morbidity, so it is critical that models accurately incorporate expected adverse event rates from vaccination. However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus has shown that the economic costs of an epidemic can be out of all proportion to the numbers infected, indicating that minimizing the duration of a smallpox outbreak might also be a critical priority when formulating control strategy [12] .",

It is unclear how 30 years of changes in household sizes, working patterns, and mobility would affect transmission patterns today. Incorporating If used to protect an entire population on an ongoing basis, policy has high, long-term cost, and a large number of probably unnecessary vaccineassociated adverse events would be expected for as long as policy is followed When attempting to choose the most appropriate of these response policies prior to an actual event, analyses highlight the importance of beliefs regarding the nature of a bioterrorist attack and response logistics, in addition to disease epidemiology. In the case of smallpox, several examples may be considered. Would an attack be small and controllable through traced vaccination or large enough to require mass vaccination? Would an attack be overt, in which case it could prove possible to respond immediately in a highly targeted fashion and obtain much better results or covert and detected only from symptomatic cases as assumed in this chapter? If traced vaccination was used in response to an attack, would tracing prove accurate and efficient (as documented for a highly unusual natural outbreak that occurred in a Nigerian town) or inaccurate (as suggested by a simulated large attack in a metropolitan area with population 10 million)? Could a rapid mass vaccination campaign be mounted soon enough after an attack occurs and with sufficiently high population coverage to avert most of the second-generation infections, but with care to avoid vaccine complications among those with contraindications? Having never faced a deliberate smallpox attack, there are no empiric answers to questions such as these. In particular, it is an assumption to pretend that parameters such as R 0 are known, even if estimated on the basis of past outbreaks, because such outbreaks could bear no resemblance to what could occur in a bioterrorist attack [13] .",

(1) Assumes the effect of the control policies on R, based on review and \"judgment\"; that is, effectiveness of policies is an input into the model rather than an output; the model therefore has little explanatory or predictive power; (2) large number of parameters assumed, limited sensitivity analysis performed; (3) assumes disease has no effect on the depletion of susceptibles; (4) assessment of threat of attack is subjective If an attack occurs in the near future, it is unlikely that a genetically modified strain of variola would be used. However, if the strain is genetically modified to increase its virulence, possible consequences could be even more dramatic. Unfortunately, scientific advancements over the last two decades have made it possible to develop genetically altered strains of orthopoxviruses [16] . Genetic engineering of viruses has become a common practice. One major objective of genetic manipulation is to use engineered viral vectors for the delivery of genetic information with therapeutic intent or to modify viruses so as to alter the host's immune response. Changes in virulence and host range of modified viruses are generally hard to predict. However, when one studies the possibility of making variola virus more pathogenic, the research and development (R&D) work will most likely be focused on targets such as:",

After the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration on the eradication of smallpox in 1979, routine smallpox vaccination in Israel was officially discontinued in July 1980. Army recruits continued to receive smallpox vaccination until July 1996. A first responder revaccination campaign began on September 2002 and as of May 2003, some 22,000 doses have been administered [17] . Data collected during the eradication campaign showed that neutralizing antibodies to smallpox are persistent and may be detected 20 years or more after vaccination [18] . More recent studies reported that after two revaccinations, the antibody levels to vaccinia persist and may provide a sufficient level of immunity for 30-75 years [19, 20] . Similar conclusions were drawn by Crotty and his group. They have studied long-term B cell memory after smallpox vaccination in a previously (3 months to 60 years) vaccinated group. Their results demonstrated initial exponential decay of memory B cells, with a half-life of <1 year, followed by a plateau ~10-fold lower than peak that is stably maintained for >50 years after vaccination [21] . Several studies also demonstrated that memory CD4+ and CD8+ Tcells to vaccinia antigen persist from months to decades after last smallpox revaccination [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .
