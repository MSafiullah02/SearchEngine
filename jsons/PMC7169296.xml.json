Skin wounds are usually associated with absent or poor bleeding and are difficult to manage. The main histological changes include a thin epidermis and a severely atrophic dermis with disorganized collagen fibres that are reduced in number and size.2 Hair follicle atrophy can be variable whereas arrector pili muscles appear relatively enlarged. Masson's trichrome stain can demonstrate tinctorial abnormalities of collagen fibres whereas elastic fibres are normal.2, 3 Electron microscopy reveals collagen bundles that are convoluted and arranged haphazardly with fibrils of different diameters, and loosely packed.4\n",

Dermatological examination revealed a dull sparse hair coat and easily visible blood vessels in the region of clipping. One single, nonbleeding, irregular skin tear of about 3 cm was observed on the sacral region (Figure 1). Radiographs revealed the presence of mega oesophagus and an alveolar pattern in the cranial lung lobes consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Oral antibiotic therapy was started once daily with cefadroxil (Cefacure Tabs, MSD Animal Health; Milan, Italy; 25 mg/kg) and enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer; Milan, Italy; 5 mg/kg). Specific management of feeding to reduce the risk of regurgitation was introduced. Histopathological findings were consistent with FSFS. The owner declined any further investigation to determine the cause of mega oesophagus. Three months later, the cat was 3.2 kg and the respiratory and cutaneous problems were resolved. A second biopsy of macroscopically normal skin was taken 11 months after the first visit. There has been no recurrence three years after the condition was diagnosed.",

Abdominal ultrasonic findings were unchanged whereas the anaemia had progressed (RBC 4.64, Hct 21.3%) and the albumin decreased (2.1 (2.5\u20134) g/dL). Two linear, nonbleeding, skin tears of about 2\u20133 cm were observed on the right scapula and flank together with fine dark material consistent with flea faeces.

Examination revealed generalized thinning of the skin, no evidence of scarring and hyperextensibility. The skin lacerations were sutured and a skin biopsy was collected. Histopathological evaluation and special stains for connective tissue were suggestive of FSFS. Meanwhile, the cat was adopted by a family and fed with a balanced diet. Cutaneous wounds healed and the kitten grew normally. At nine months of age, two skin biopsies were taken during ovariohysterectomy.

Less commonly, FSFS has been described in cats affected by severe inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic diseases without glucocorticoids involvement.10, 11, 12, 13 In these latter cases none of the cats recovered, contrary to this report. Hepatic lipidosis, a condition frequently observed in FSFS, was excluded in cases 1 and 2 by abdominal ultrasound and in Case 3 because the history was not consistent with this disease. In the cats in this series, skin fragility was diagnosed after the development of a cachectic condition. A common element observed in cases 1 and 2 was the relatively abrupt reduction in food intake and the consequent rapid and marked weight loss. Undoubtedly, the presence of infectious diseases likely contributed to the development of cachexia. In Case 2, FIV was considered to have a chronic course but it could have further hampered the recovery of the cat exacerbating its already limited ability to feed itself. In the kitten (Case 3), malnutrition was the only suspected cause. In this cat, the high\u2010energy requirements due to the young age may have prompted the development of cachexia, even in the absence of a concurrent illness.",

As demonstrated by histological examination and special stains, the skin of these cats was indistinguishable from the controls once the animals recovered from the cachectic status. Because corticosteroids also induce a catabolic state, the steroid\u2010induced FSFS and the cachexia\u2010related FSFS could share, at least partially, similar pathogenic pathways. Cachexia per se, or in association with other specific diseases, could play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of FSFS, mainly in those cases where exogenous steroids are not involved.",
