No homolog of nsp7 has so far been identified in other viral systems (van Aken et al. 2006 ). Recently, a novel nsp4 cleavage site, conserved among arteriviruses, has been identified within nsp7 giving rise to two sub-domains, nsp7a and 7b, even though immunoprecipitation analyses could only identify the former (van Aken et al. 2006) . In order to further our understanding of the role of nsp7, we have determined the solution structure of nsp7a, which has a unique protein fold but possesses no recognizable functional motifs (unpublished data). In this note we report the 1 H, 15 N and 13 C backbone and side chains resonance assignments for nsp7a. ",
