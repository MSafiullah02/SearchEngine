            "text": "Background: Influenza reassortment, a mechanism where influenza viruses exchange their RNA segments by co-infecting a single cell, has been implicated in several major pandemics since 19th century. Owing to the significant impact on public health and social stability, great attention has been received on the identification of influenza reassortment. Methods: We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. Results: It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses. Conclusions: Our study presents a novel method for the prediction of influenza reassortment. We hope this method could facilitate rapid reassortment detection and provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses.",

In addition, reassortment between two different swine influenza viruses, which themselves contained genes from previous human, swine and avian influenza strains, caused another pandemic in 2009 [8] . These pandemics have not only killed numerous people but also led to enormous economic losses. Therefore, early identification of influenza reassortment and potential reassortant strains are crucial for the surveillance and prevention of pandemics in the future.",

            "text": "With the rapid growth of flu data in recent years, increasing complete influenza genomes are publicly available [9] . There is little concern about the acquisition and interpretation of the data. Many efforts have been made to detect influenza reassortment events using the influenza genomic data. The common approach of identifying influenza reassortment is to construct fixed phylogenetic trees relating each segment of the strains [10] [11] [12] . Two methods were proposed for identifying reassortment events based on the difference between phylogenetic trees or tree subsets [13] . These trees are compared to detect disagreements of different strains, but it is a laborious and time-consuming process. Moreover, it provides no guarantee that all reassortments have been found. To account for the uncertainty in the inferred phylogenies, a novel computational method named GiRaF was developed to identify reassortment [14] . In GiRaF, large collections of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampled trees were searched for groups of incompatible splits by a fast biclique enumeration algorithm. This successfully detected some known reassortments in avian, human and swine influenza strains. Yurovsky and Moret presented a fully automated flu reassortment finder called FluRF that employed a bottom-up search on the reconstructed phylogenetic trees of full and segment-based genomes [15] . However, the computational cost of phylogeny laid a formidable barrier for reassortment detection using phylogenetic analysis with a large scale of the dataset. Silva et al. aimed to solve this problem by formulating a phylogeny independent method that only utilized nucleotide distance matrices as input for reassortment detection [16] . Furthermore, Rabadan et al. provided a quantitative method to measure the genetic shift from nucleotide sequence data that did not rely on phylogenetic analysis for reassortment detection [17] . Villa and L\u00e4ssig determined rate and average selective effect of reassortment process in human influenza H3N2 using a new method to map reassortment events from joint genealogies of multiple genome segments [18] . Eng et al. developed an influenza reassortment simulation tool through host tropism protein signatures [19] . This program computationally simulates reassortment between the eight viral segments and then generates a list of all possible reassortant progeny based on the signatures.",

In particular, none of the existing approaches scale well to large datasets in detecting all reassortants. In this paper, we develop a novel approach named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment) that employs machine learning techniques to calculate the reassortment probability by predicting the host tropism in a given collection of genomic sequences. HopPER first generates the feature vectors by seven physicochemical properties of amino acids from influenza sequences of three major hosts (avian, human, swine) with global descriptors CTD (Composition, Transition and Distribution). It then applies a kernel perspective on host probability estimation by the random forest [20] for a single sequence and then combines all segments of the genome to produce an overall estimation of reassortment probability. We tested HopPER on both real datasets and synthetic datasets to evaluate the capacity of estimating the reassortment possibility of genomes. HopPER is compared with some state-of-the-art methods. The results show that HopPER has successfully identified reassortments with high precision.Furthermore, HopPER is efficient in detecting reassortment for even incomplete genomes (with at least two available genomic segments) and in analyzing large datasets. We hope HopPER can assist flu surveillance and prevent future pandemics.",

As far as we know, the reassortant strains are responsible for the majority of flu pandemics in history and will continuously threaten public health. While any exchange of genetic material between different influenza viral RNA segments can be considered as reassortment. In this paper, we mainly focus on identifying interspecies reassortments that have occurred across hosts. It is similar to definitions of host tropism predictors in the literature, except that here the problem is formulated probabilistically to enable a quantified estimate of host origin. Hence, host tropism is modelled by quantifying the reassortant probabilities. The model can also detect intra-host reassortments, for instance between different viral strains that have originate from one single host category such as avian. In the model, the actual host in which the mixing occurred is disregarded and the focus is mainly on detecting past reassortants and the potential evolutionary relationships that may be inferred. For all practical purposes, we only use avian, human and swine strains that account for the overwhelming majority of the existing sequence data. The following subsections respectively elaborate the dataset and the structure of the model. Figure 1 presents the flowchart of HopPER.",

Similarly, segment M consists of M1 and M2 proteins and segment NS comprises NS1 and NS2 proteins. We only select NS1 and M2 proteins as representatives for host tropism prediction. This is because we could collect many more samples on NS1 and M2 to construct the model.

To ensure the robustness of our models, all the datasets are split into independent training dataset and testing dataset with a ratio of 0.8:0.2. We first apply ten-fold cross validation technique to develop our models and evaluate the training process with random forest, and then the independent testing dataset is used to assess the ability of our model in predicting the host tropism of new data.

The datasets of 16 resembled novel 2009 swine-origin isolates, 6 triple reassortant H3N2 strains throughout Canada and 39 reassortment events in swine influenza strains were constructed from a largescale whole-genome sequences [43] [44] [45] . More comprehensively, 36 well supported candidate reassortants [16] , 93 single-taxa and multi-taxa reassortment candidates [14, 46] were also selected for validation. A brief description of these genome datasets follows below. We compared HopPER with the above 6 described state-of-the-art methods by their ability to detect reassortment on real test datasets. Table 3 shows the results of the number of reassortants identified by HopPER and other methods. We set the threshold of 0.5 to classify the reassorted and non-reassorted strains in HopPER. The annotation of real test datasets and corresponding reassortment probabilities can be found in Additional file 1: Table S2 . According to the results, our approach easily picked up reassortants where the strains varied in hosts across different periods. Overall, 178 out of 208 strains were successfully detected as reassortants. Looking at outcomes in each dataset, it is apparent that all the similar swine-origin H3N2 influenza strains were recognized as reassortants. Perhaps the number of test genomes on this dataset was not significant and the TPV was only 0.806 on de Silva et al. dataset, slightly worse than other datasets. Some of the reassortant strains identified by Silva et al. were reported for the first time. This could decrease the confidence of the candidates as true reassortant strains. Nevertheless, the evaluation on the real datasets displayed strong evidence for the characterization of reassortment by HopPER, e.g. the validation on Nagarajan et al. dataset achieved TPV of 0.860, which contained larger quantity of genomes with a diversity of strains.",

Of particular interest was the potential host adaptation for individual segments of the genome. Selected avian, human and swine genomic strains are shown in Table 4 , indicating the reassortment patterns based on host tropism and reassortment probabilities. The results incorporated the most likely host adaptation for each protein. Most of the reassortants displayed a diversity of host adaptation of influenza sequences in the genome. Table 4 indicates that more than one host species exists in all genomes except the strain A/domestic teal/Hunan/79/2005, which is estimated as a reassortant with the probability of 0.701, with the host tropism for each segment being the same. Another finding was that the reassortment probability of strain A/domestic teal/Hunan/79/2005 was not high compared with others. We may infer that interspecies transmission of influenza viruses had a direct impact on our probability estimation. Correspondingly, we would obtain more credible reassortment events if we can demonstrate that the sequences in the genome stemmed from different species. Reassortant strains are implicated in several major pandemics in history with reassortments occurring across different hosts. An example is swine-origin reassortant, which comprises genes derived from avian, human and classical swine [8] . More attention is needed for the reassortant strains when the complement of individual protein sequences are from three or more different host species detected by HopPER. Besides, the emergence of novel HA segment in a reassorted genome is crucial for the outbreak of potential pandemics that has to be considered.",

For example, in A/swine/ Ontario/53518/03, we found that the segment PB1 was [42] . The H3N2 viruses recovered from Canada in January 1997 like A/swine/Ontario/00130/97 from Ontario isolates, which were regarded as wholly human influenza viruses [40] . It was consistent with our results that four segments M2, NA, PA and PB1 originated from human influenza viruses, suggesting strong interspecies transmission of the different clades. Similarly, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 lineage in Asia has demonstrated various combinations of its genes to form several generations of multiple reassortants [51] . The precursor of H5N1 strain A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 and the re-emerging strain A/peregrine falcon/Hong Kong/2142/2008 were reassortants with probabilities 0.748 and 0.546 respectively (Additional file 1: S2). The complex reassortment mechanism and manifold possibility of combination could adversely affect the host tropism prediction and overestimate the probability of reassortment, but HopPER has manifested the robustness of its capability to identify reassortment and also provided perspectives for evolutionary patterns.",

            "text": "To further verify our model's ability to identify induced reassortants and assess performance in a controlled setting, we carried out experiments on lab-synthesized reassortant strains. These synthetic strains were regarded as the true label on the detection of reassortants. The synthetic dataset was divided into complete and incomplete genomes that contained 85 and 25 samples respectively. According to the rules of our model, the data of incomplete genomes contained two different sequences at least. We have summarized the results of reassortment detection on both complete and incomplete strains by HopPER in Table 5 . HopPER correctly identified 19 out of 25 reassortants for incomplete genomes and 83 out of 85 reassortants for complete genomes on synthetic strains. The probabilities of reassortment can be seen in Additional file 1: Table S4 . Though the incomplete information of genomes likely influenced the prediction of reassortment, the TPV achieved by HopPER on laboratory dataset (0.927) was more persuasive compared with the real dataset (0.855). On observation, the false positives reported by our model were dominated by incomplete samples. We have found that all these false positives only contain HA and NA proteins while most of the rest of incomplete genomes have more than two different segments (Additional file 1: Table S5 ). In general, we can infer that the number of available segments in a genome is a critical factor impacting the reliable estimation of reassortment probability. Despite this, the false positive rate was still less than 0.1 on synthetic datasets. It is usually hard or impossible to detect the reassortment by either our model or other methods if the input genome is incomplete. It also poses great challenges for any other computational tools to identify reassortment events with lots of missing information in the genome. We are able to explore the reassortant strains in synthetic genomes by estimating the probabilities without constraining the integrity of genomes. Though the reassortment analysis on incomplete genomes brings uncertainty of probability estimation and increases the difficulty of identifying reassortment, the results are not greatly affected using HopPER. We have successfully identified 24 out of 35 and 19 out of 25 incomplete strains in real and synthetic datasets respectively. The TPVs of reassortment detection on incomplete strains has achieved noteworthy performance in comparison to complete ones. However, a look into the unsuccessful cases of incomplete strains finds most of the failures in genomes with only 2 segments. We also list the predicted reassortant strains by the number of available sequences in the genome (Additional file 1: Table S6 ). It demonstrates the effectiveness of HopPER in predicting reassortment of incomplete strains.",

Despite the longterm existence of the influenza virus, the influence of the reassortment in the expected transmission properties of influenza viruses is still an area of active research. A study on 71 representative complete genomes sampled between 1918 to 2006 showed reassortment occurred frequently throughout the evolutionary history of the virus [53] . Though some reassortment events would not cause severe infections or lead to outbreaks, reassortment still plays an important role in the process of evolution and epidemiology for influenza viruses, particularly when considering transmission from avian or swine host populations into human populations. For example, pigs have been known as a mixing vessel with multiple reassortment events occurring. While most of the cases were mild to humans, three out of four pandemics are related to the reassorted swine strains. It is clear that the reassortment between influenza viruses from different host species can generate novel pandemic-potential strains. These antigenic and genetic novel strains are usually not well matched to the contemporaneous vaccines, and so existing vaccines offer little protection [10] . Detecting reassortment frequency among influenza viruses is also a crucial aspect to capture evolutionary history [54] .",

Figure 3 presents the RSR of influenza strains on three distinct species across different years. The experiments are conducted on the years with more than 20 genomes. The results reflect the complex reassortment histories and suggest the reliability compared with the actual evolutionary patterns. In Fig. 3a , the RSR sustains a relative low level until 2004, when the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the H5N1 subtype has re-emerged [55] . The HPAI H5N1 virus results from its ability to transmit through both human and bird hosts, leading to novel reassortant strains [56] . The human species describes the different situations in which RSR reaches the local peaks around the pandemic years. The RSR starts to decrease after the outbreak of 1976 pandemic when a new H1N1 strain predominated. After that, another pandemic occurred in 2009 caused by a triple reassortant swine-origin human strain during the time there is a rapid increase of RSR in Fig. 3b . The RSR of swine species varies differently from avian and human and it gains high value, except in 2008. We infer that the swine species, as the mixing vessel, more frequently participates in the reassortment process with both avian and human strains. According to Fig. 3 , the RSR remains at relatively high level after 2009. This is because the progeny strains of these 2009 strains are still circulating around the world. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with post-infection ferret antisera indicates that the majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses are antigenically homogeneous and closely related to the vaccine virus A/California/7/2009 [57] . It is noteworthy as a possible indication for the resurgence of another potential pandemic or epidemic after the current reassortant strains have been in circulation.",
