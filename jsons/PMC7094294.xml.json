This measures distress experienced by a victim or witness of recent serious life changes/event. It has been commonly used to assess persons with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It can be broken down into an intrusion scale and an avoidance scale. A cutoff of 26 and above has been suggested for a clinically significant reaction to a psychological trauma, although the IES alone does not diagnose PTSD or reflect a person's ability to function.2.\nThe Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS)\n[10]. This is a 14-item self-rated scale for measurement of both anxiety and depression (seven questions each). It was designed for use in a medical population as it does not contain questions on physical symptomology, which may contaminate the scores. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety or depression. Scores from 8 to 10 on each scale indicate possible clinical disorder and 11 to 21 probable clinical disorder.3.\nThe Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)\n[11], [12]. This is a measure of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) used in many different diseases and provides measures of different aspects of functioning and limitations. Higher scores indicate higher level of functioning. In Singapore, it has been used to assess the quality of life of a few disease populations, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), osteo-arthritis, and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. A working example of the calculation of the expected scores in the Singapore population adjusted for age, gender, and ethnicity is illustrated in Table 1\n.\n",

Evaluated against local SLE patients [13], the SARS patients were more affected in two domains: the physical role limitation and social functioning. The degree of impairment reached that of SLE patients. The decline in social functioning could be partly accounted for by the fact that SARS was a highly contagious disease, and, consciously or otherwise, patients might reduce social activities. The decline in physical role was intriguing, considering that there was no proportional corresponding decline in physical function or vitality, as in the case of the SLE population. This could be due to the failure of the instrument to detect the decline. Alternatively, the role limitation due to emotional factor might have been misperceived as role limitation due to physical concerns.",

Further, the HRQoL SF-36 profile of the SARS patients also shares the typical physical role limitation like that of depressed patients, with a disproportionate impairment in the physical function (Fig. 3) [18], [19]. In the report by Malik et al. [20] on the quality of life of PTSD sufferers (Fig. 3), however, there was neither physical impairment nor physical role limitation.
