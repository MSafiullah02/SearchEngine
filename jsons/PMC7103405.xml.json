            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which broke out in 2002\u20132003 has caused worldwide panic due to its high mortality in humans (Peiris et al., 2004). In 2003, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the aetiological agent for this disease (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). The genome of SARS-CoV is a plus-stranded single RNA which is 29,727 nucleotides in length excluding the polyadenylation tract at the 3\u2032 end (Rota et al., 2003). Fourteen ORFs have been identified, which translate into two replicative polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), 4 structural proteins (S, E, M, N) and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9b) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The accessory proteins are unique to SARS-CoV, as they have little homology in amino acid sequence with accessory proteins of other coronaviruses. All current studies concerning accessory proteins of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV suggest that they are not essential for virus replication (de Haan et al., 2002, Yount et al., 2005), but do affect virus release, stability, pathogenesis, and finally contribute to the virulence (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). Understanding the properties and functions of SARS-CoV specific accessory proteins may help to explain the differences in pathogenicity between SARS-CoV and other known coronaviruses.",

Our previous study also shows that 3a protein functions as an ion channel to facilitate virus release (Lu et al., 2006). In addition, ORF7a protein was also characterized as a virion-associated protein of SARS-CoV (Huang et al., 2006a), which induces apoptosis ((Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006, Tan et al., 2004) and arrests the cell cycle when over-expressed (Yuan et al., 2006). Subsequently, both SARS-CoV ORF6 and ORF7b proteins were determined to be incorporated into virus particles(Huang et al., 2007, Schaecher et al., 2007). ORF6 protein was further reported to function as an IFN antagonist and to accelerate replication of a related mouse virus (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007, Tangudu et al., 2007). Four other accessory proteins have not been well investigated, and some of them may be included in virions and have important functions (Tan et al., 2006).",

On bicistronic mRNA9, a 98 amino acid viral accessory protein, 9b, is encoded from a complete internal ORF within the N gene. The expression of ORF9b has been detected in infected cells and in clinical specimens (Chan et al., 2005). Anti-9b antibodies have also been found in the serum of SARS patients (Qiu et al., 2005). The crystal structure additionally indicates that 9b protein is an unusual membrane binding protein with a long hydrophobic lipid-binding tunnel. It was therefore proposed to be associated with intracellular vesicles and may have function in SARS-CoV assembly (Meier et al., 2006). However, further analysis of 9b protein is necessary for understanding its contribution in the viral life cycle.",

To further investigate the properties of SARS-CoV 9b protein, purified recombinant 9b protein was used to produce both anti-9b polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The expression of 9b protein in SARS-CoV infected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis with anti-9b monoclonal antibody. An 11 kDa protein (9b protein) was recognized in infected but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 1\nB left). The specificity was further ensured by immunoprecipitation with anti-9b polyclonal antibody. The complex precipitated was resolved under gel electrophoresis and the corresponding band was submitted to mass spectrometry. A peptide: \u201cAFQSTPIVVQMTK\u201d representing amino acids 69\u201381 of the SARS-CoV 9b protein was identified (Fig. 1B right).",

The 9b protein encoded by an internal ORF starts at the 18th nucleotide downstream of the transcription regulatory sequence of mRNA9 (Thiel et al., 2003). The start codon for ORF9b is very close to the start codon for ORFN, with only 10 nucleotides in between (Fig. 1A). To confirm that 9b protein can be translated from an mRNA corresponding to the SARS-CoV subgenomic RNA9, the sequence encoding ORFN which contains ORF9b was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS and transfected into 293T cells. The results showed that 9b protein was able to be expressed in cells transfected with plasmids containing the N gene coding region (Fig. 1C ORFN), but that the expression level was relatively weaker compared with that of cells transfected with ORF9b alone (Fig. 1C ORF9b). When the ORF9b initiation codon was mutated from ATG to ACG (Fig. 1C N(9b\u2212)), 9b protein was not expressed while the expression level of N protein showed little change. When the ORFN initiation codon was mutated from ATG to ATC (Fig. 1C N(N\u2212)), N protein was not expressed while the expression level of 9b protein dramatically increased. These data not only demonstrated the expression of 9b protein from the N gene coding region, but also led us to further investigate the translation regulatory mechanism for 9b protein.",

Analysis of the sequence flanking the initiation codon of ORFN and ORF9b showed that the initiation of the N gene represented a suboptimal Kozak context (A at \u2212 3, T at + 4), while the initiation of the 9b gene indicated an optimal Kozak context (A at \u2212 3, G at + 4) (Kozak, 1986). In addition, a lower expression level of 9b protein had been observed already in cells transfected with ORFN and then in cells transfected with ORF9b or N(N\u2212). All of these findings make it reasonable to presume that the translation initiation of ORF9b is regulated by a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism under which the downstream gene expression is affected by the translation efficiency of the upstream gene (Kozak, 1987, Kozak, 1989). To test this, a more ideal Kozak context was induced in ORFN (Fig. 1C ORFN + 4T to G). We detected an obviously decreased expression level of 9b protein as expected. Meanwhile, when the Kozak context of ORFN was changed to a much weaker one (Fig. 1C ORFN \u2212 3A to C), an increased expression of 9b protein was observed. Together, these data suggest that ORF9b protein is translated via a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism.",

Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV had been classified as group 2b CoV distantly related to known group 2 CoV (Gorbalenya et al., 2004, Snijder et al., 2003). The functions of viral replicase and four basic structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) of SARS-CoV are similar to those of other coronaviruses. However, the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV show little homology to those of known coronaviruses. The specific properties of these accessory proteins may contribute to the differences in pathogenicity between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. In this report, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV 9b protein is another viral accessory protein incorporated into virus particles. Our finding makes 9b protein the fifth accessory protein of SARS-CoV to be found present in virions.",

Here, our data further indicate that 9b protein is the fifth virion-associated accessory protein of SARS-CoV to be recognized. Analysis of VLPs and purified SARS-CoV particles showed that the highest level of 9b protein was detected in the fractions also abundant in S, N, and M proteins. While this property is almost equivalent among these accessory structural proteins, they do exhibited different biochemical characteristics. Some, such as 3a and 6 proteins, are released from expressing cells, while others, like 7a and 9b proteins, are not detectable in the supernatant of expressing cells. As a result, the release of the protein itself is seen not to be a determinant of incorporation. The localization of these proteins to intracellular vesicle components like Golgi and ER may help them to be incorporated through mechanisms bringing them close to the site of virus assembly. The mechanism of incorporating accessory proteins into virus particles is still not well understood and must be further studied. Furthermore, it will be important to address the necessity of incorporation of all these accessory proteins into virions.",

This result was similar to what was found with 7a protein; the release of these two accessory proteins with E protein may be caused by their incorporation into putative E protein-containing vesicles (Maeda et al., 1999, Huang et al., 2006a). When M protein but not S or N protein was added, the release of 9b into the medium was increased markedly, indicating that E and M proteins are sufficient to allow incorporation of 9b protein into virus-like particles. This is consistent with former studies showing that E and M proteins could form smooth virus-like particles when co-expressed, while S and N were unnecessary for VLP formation (Hsieh et al., 2005, Mortola and Roy, 2004). As we do not have evidence for interactions between 9b and E or M proteins, we cannot determine whether the incorporation of 9b protein into VLPs generated by E and M co-expressing cells is caused by the physical associations among them. However, this mechanism requires further examination.",

Black box represents RNA leading sequence. ORFN is highlighted in blue, while ORF9b is shown in an enlarged representation highlighted in green. TRS sequence is marked by underlines and in grey. Start codon of ORFN and 9b are shown in corresponding colors, adapted from (Meier et al., 2006, Thiel et al., 2003). (B) Left. 11 kDa 9b protein was detected in SARS infected FRhK-4 cells by anti-9b monoclonal antibody, but not in uninfected cells. \u03b2-actin was detected in both infected and uninfected cells. Right. 9b protein was immunoprecipitated by anti-9b polyclonal antibody from SARS infected FRhK-4 cell lysates in RIPA buffer, the mass spectrometry analysis of the corresponding gel slices detected a specific peptide that represents 9b protein. (C) Translation of ORF9b by leaky ribosomal scanning. Schematic diagram of cDNA constructs is shown (upper panel). Wild-type ORF9b sequence (ORF9b), wild-type N gene sequence (ORFN), a point mutation eliminating 9b initiation codon in ORFN sequence (N(9b\u2212)), a point mutation eliminating N initiation codon (N(N\u2212)), an optimal Kozak context around the ORFN initiation codon (ORFN + 4T to G), and a weaker Kozak context around the ORFN initiation codon (ORFN \u2212 3A to C). 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated cDNAs and analyzed by Western blot with both anti-N and anti-9b monoclonal antibodies for each sample. \u03b2-actin was detected by actin specific polyclonal antibody.",
