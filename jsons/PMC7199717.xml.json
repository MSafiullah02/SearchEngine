Only exception was the first case, the United States, where the proposal originated from renowned scientists prompting the political leadership to the pertinent decision (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-030-46997-9_1).Determination to achieving deterrence against an attack by a nuclear adversary\u2014with exception of the US who had striven for primacy in world power, and most likely of Israel and South Africa who wanted to deter a broad alliance of adversaries. They all tried to balance a perceived severe external threat to their national security with the choice of an equally large threat, the possession of nuclear weapons.Common irony though: nuclear weapon holders after World War II lost a number of wars they entered, the UK at Suez (Egypt), France in Algeria, the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the US in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. The UK and France could not hold on to their colonial possessions despite having nuclear weapons, and the Soviet Union collapsed all while sitting on the world\u2019s largest ever nuclear arsenal. One may notice that in the wars mentioned, nuclear capacity was on one side only. Luckily, or otherwise there would be probably no winner at all.\n",

Often a reduction in armaments goes hand in hand with an upgrading of their capabilities or, as their owners call it, their \u201cmodernization\u201d; the aim always being to enhance nuclear weapons\u2019 effectiveness. As shown on the table of global nuclear arsenals of Annex V, the number of nuclear weapons of the nine nuclear weapon possessors was at the beginning of 2019 estimated at around 13,890. This figure, according to SIPRI, shows a reduction from the 14,465 nuclear weapons of the same countries in early 2018. Any reduction in the numbers of nuclear weapons is mainly due to Russia and the US\u2014these two still possess about 91% of all world\u2019s nuclear weapons\u2014who reduced their strategic nuclear powers in line with the recent implementation of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010 (New START).",

A climate necessary to firstly mitigate the immense risks stemming from the currently uncontrollable nuclear threat and secondly  eliminate the global nuclear threat through an agreed nuclear disarmament plan. This would be the solution of the nuclear Nash equilibrium [18], in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict nor to disarm. This famous equilibrium reflects in our days fully the reality of the MAD nuclear strategy, the Mutually Assured Destruction. The only posible solution of the Nash equilibrium would be lowering all armed raised hands before shutting at each other by necessity, absurdity or error. This is the bitter reality which should convince all nuclear weapon possessors on the imminent need to escape the dead-end MAD strategy by courageously solving the Nash equilibrium.",

It is the entropy of the universe, the global trend to move everything from order to disorder and then to new unpredictable equilibria. Mankind does not need to provoke disorder and uncertainty through its nuclear weapons but try to form stable and peaceful power balances. Rules of balance and power shifting are universal, applying to both microcosmic and macrocosmic processes; hence, to human geopolitical nuclear rearrangements too. Winners are leaders and people who respect the mighty and mysterious universe adapting quickly and smartly to its rules. Elseways, world\u2019s perspective is gloomy. In my opinion, there are still clear minds around, close to unconventional, cynical or incompetent decision makers.",
